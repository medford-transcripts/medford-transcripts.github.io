[SPEAKER_65]: In February, we celebrate Black History Month.

33
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:42,401
[SPEAKER_65]: The story of Medford is a story of black achievement and black community, from abolitionist organizing, to local icons like Belinda Sutton, to the historic black community of West Medford.

34
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,123
[SPEAKER_65]: This Black History Month, we celebrate black history in Medford.

35
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:48,266
[SPEAKER_65]: We endeavor to hold black history and celebrate it every month of the year.

36
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:54,431
[SPEAKER_65]: And I hope that we can recommit ourselves to policies that will allow Medford to remain a diverse community for people of all backgrounds.

37
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:55,192
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

38
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:01,278
[SPEAKER_42]: I have nothing to add.

39
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:02,218
[SPEAKER_42]: I thought that was beautiful.

40
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:02,739
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

41
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:20,383
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm happy to be part of co-offering this to celebrate this Black History Month, and I'm happy to be part of a town that is historically a community that celebrates that.

42
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:21,987
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

43
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:24,769
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor say thank you, President bears.

44
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:38,658
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor about Vice President Collins for your words on this black history, black history is meant for history, and we cherish meant for history we talked about how it's such a blessing to be living in such a historic

45
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:40,599
[SPEAKER_28]: a town, a city.

46
00:02:41,239 --> 00:03:02,173
[SPEAKER_28]: And when we think about what has brought us up to this moment, Black Medfordians, and especially the historically Black community in West Medford, has played such a pivotal and integral role to shaping who we are today, the discourse that shapes our politics today, and just the joy, the memories, the happiness of growing up in Medford.

47
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:06,416
[SPEAKER_28]: I was reminded of this, especially on Martin Luther King's Day.

48
00:03:08,557 --> 00:03:22,487
[SPEAKER_28]: When I got this book, Place, Race, and Memory, the West Medford Afro-American Remembrance Project, which talks about a bunch of icons that have lived in our city, been a vital part of our West Medford community.

49
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:32,294
[SPEAKER_28]: And I was really touched reading a lot of these stories and at the same time, a bit sad that I didn't grow up learning about a lot of these folks.

50
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:46,985
[SPEAKER_28]: There's such a long way to go when it comes to racial reconciliation in the city, when it comes to making sure that all of our neighbors, our black neighbors included feel welcome and engaged as part of our city.

51
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:53,130
[SPEAKER_28]: And there's so much more work to do as part of that social justice plan going forward.

52
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:59,836
[SPEAKER_28]: little steps first on the on February 19th.

53
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:01,557
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a Monday from 10 a.m.

54
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:02,498
[SPEAKER_28]: to 1 p.m.

55
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:07,541
[SPEAKER_28]: In these chambers, our city will be hosting a celebration on Black History Month.

56
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:12,104
[SPEAKER_28]: I encourage you all to come join us and celebrate Black History Month.

57
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:14,926
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councillor Sang.

58
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:15,747

66
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:29,771
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Scarpelli.

67
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,052
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Mr. President.

68
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:39,075
[SPEAKER_32]: Again, it seems that we've lost another legend here in Medford.

69
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,241
[SPEAKER_32]: He didn't have to have a first name.

70
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,603
[SPEAKER_32]: He didn't have to have a last name.

71
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:48,789
[SPEAKER_32]: He was just known as Bruni and an individual that.

72
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:58,216
[SPEAKER_32]: grew up with Down syndrome and was a family who had an amazing family.

73
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:09,748
[SPEAKER_32]: His sister Carol Carviello, Rick Carviello's former council president, council Rick Carviello's brother-in-law, great nieces and nephews that loved him.

74
00:05:11,513 --> 00:05:20,619
[SPEAKER_32]: Bruni was a fixture, whether it was on the music site here in Medford, because he loved to dance and he loved to sing.

75
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:31,687
[SPEAKER_32]: But most people know Bruni and remember Bruni as one of the most committed Medford Mustang supporters in our athletic fields.

76
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:34,069
[SPEAKER_32]: I remember a story.

77
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,033
[SPEAKER_32]: You don't really make it until Bruno, until Bruni recognizes you.

78
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:52,580
[SPEAKER_32]: We were coaching, I was coaching probably my 14th year at Medford High School, and our boys had just finished their sixth straight season without losing a GBL game, and we're going into the state finals.

79
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,223
[SPEAKER_32]: And I wasn't nervous as a coach, I was ready to go, our boys were ready to go.

80
00:05:57,783 --> 00:06:04,687
[SPEAKER_32]: And I remember someone beside me, and I turned to the right, and here's this posing gentleman wearing a Medford jacket.

81
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,949
[SPEAKER_32]: And I said, Bruni, he says, coach,

82
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,809
[SPEAKER_32]: And I said, that minute, I said, boy, two things.

83
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:11,869
[SPEAKER_32]: I said, I made it.

84
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,692
[SPEAKER_32]: As a team and as a coach, we made it.

85
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:15,393
[SPEAKER_32]: Bruni was there.

86
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:18,596
[SPEAKER_32]: And two, that now I'm nervous.

87
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:20,458
[SPEAKER_32]: because Bruni was here.

88
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:26,623
[SPEAKER_32]: So he left that mark and everybody that crossed his path, he always had a smile on his face.

89
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:37,351
[SPEAKER_32]: He loved being around him, but individuals with Down syndrome, he lived a full and happy life.

90
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:46,258
[SPEAKER_32]: He just has had an amazing family that supported him and Mefford will miss him and send his condolences to his family.

91
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:46,959
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you.

92
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,063
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

93
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:56,665
[SPEAKER_37]: I also want to send my condolences to Councillor Carviello and Carol and their whole family.

94
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:58,705
[SPEAKER_37]: I know that they are in mourning.

95
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:06,126
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further comment on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Sang.

96
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:06,926
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favour?

97
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:07,366
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

98
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:08,307
[SPEAKER_37]: All opposed?

99
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:09,267
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

100
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:13,308
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-030 offered by Councillor Scarpelli.

101
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:15,208
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it resolved.

102
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:24,183
[SPEAKER_37]: excuse me, sorry, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Patrick O'Brien, lifelong resident of our great city and committed volunteer on his recent retirement at UPS.

103
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:25,263
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Scarpelli.

104
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:41,848
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, Council President, you normally don't put a retiree from UPS on your agenda, but someone like Pat O'Brien, I get more phone calls from residents and owners of small businesses that talked about losing a fixture here in Medford.

105
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,463
[SPEAKER_32]: You all have, if you live in Medford, if you've been around Medford, you know, Pat O'Brien.

106
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:50,305
[SPEAKER_32]: Pat's the hardest working individual I've ever seen in your life.

107
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:56,089
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, he's in a big brown truck and yes, he's always wearing brown, but he is always running.

108
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,650
[SPEAKER_32]: He's never stopping.

109
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:03,014
[SPEAKER_32]: He's always giving back to the community, whether it was in his position as a UPS driver and, um,

110
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:17,213
[SPEAKER_32]: But I remember Pat as someone that volunteered at the ice rink, that drove the Zamboni to make sure the ice hockey team had the best surface, whether it be coaching baseball or coaching basketball for his children.

111
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:19,734
[SPEAKER_32]: He was someone that was always a fixture in Metro.

112
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:21,455
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just want to congratulate him.

113
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:28,177
[SPEAKER_32]: He's a great role model for any Method resident that lives with the motto of working hard,

114
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:32,239
[SPEAKER_32]: to the community.

115
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,740
[SPEAKER_32]: So we wish Pat, uh, happy retirement.

116
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:43,864
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know what he's going to do with all that energy he has, but, um, maybe he can come here and, you know, maybe work with the city council.

117
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:46,726
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, help you with cleaning out the back room again.

118
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:47,926
[SPEAKER_32]: Council president.

119
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,027
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you.

120
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:52,428
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

121
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,189
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further comment?

122
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,511
[SPEAKER_37]: I was a classmate of Katie, and so I knew

123
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:01,198
[SPEAKER_37]: who was driving the truck when it honked.

124
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:02,098
[SPEAKER_37]: All right.

125
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:06,322
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins.

[SPEAKER_37]: I'm just going to read this from the chair if there's no objection.

131
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:27,305
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-032 offered by President Beers can be resolved by the Medford City Council that we send our deep and sincere condolences to the family of Elizabeth Betsy Schwerer, a longtime Medford Public Schools librarian and beloved member of the Medford community.

132
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:32,967
[SPEAKER_37]: Folks at Medford High School and across our Medford community probably know Betsy.

133
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:50,532
[SPEAKER_37]: either as a librarian in the schools, or as a parent of three Medford Public Schools graduates, or the wife of someone who's provided great assistance to this council, Gary Klein, and her loss is meaningful to many.

134
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:58,614
[SPEAKER_37]: And I don't want to belabor and speak from the chair, but I just feel it's important to acknowledge and send our condolences to her family.

135
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:00,754

147
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:26,123
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

148
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:26,764

151
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:39,215
[SPEAKER_37]: This was a meeting that we held to discuss the now 30 something page governing agenda.

152
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:46,097
[SPEAKER_37]: And we referred that out to a number of committees, which did a further deep dive, but I really encourage folks to take a look.

153
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:50,158
[SPEAKER_37]: We have put out 35 pages of what we plan to do this year and next year.

154
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:55,959
[SPEAKER_37]: And in my view, it is the most transparent governing plan of any municipality or municipal council in the entire Commonwealth.

155
00:10:55,979 --> 00:10:56,879
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'm very proud of it.

163

172
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:50,145
[SPEAKER_65]: The Planning and Permitting Committee had its first standing meeting to go over the projects that have so far been assigned to that committee over the coming term.

173
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:55,755
[SPEAKER_65]: and some papers in committee that have also been allocated to be worked on in that committee.

174
00:11:56,175 --> 00:12:06,642
[SPEAKER_65]: And we'll continue to create a draft schedule for working through those ordinances oriented around the zoning project, which will organize much of our work for this term.

175
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:07,443
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

176
00:12:07,883 --> 00:12:09,304

[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Callahan.

179
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:24,546
[SPEAKER_19]: public works facilities convened, and we have discussed ways that we can keep up to date on the roads and sidewalks, as well as all of the buildings that the city owns in Medford.

180
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:30,650
[SPEAKER_19]: We are excited to keep the public informed of how these efforts are moving forward with the administration.

181
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:33,611
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councillor Collins.

182
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,452

183
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:37,574
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councillor Seng to approve, seconded by...

184
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:40,295

00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:40,535

188
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:44,376
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Collins.

189
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:50,818
[SPEAKER_65]: I would motion to suspend the rolls and take out of order the scheduled public participation appearing at the end of the agenda.

190
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:55,379
[SPEAKER_65]: Then paper 24037, paper 24038, the elections papers, followed by 24021, and finally 24035.

191
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:18,633
[SPEAKER_37]: on the motion by Councilor Collins to suspend the rules to take Judy Lonergan's public participation position, 24-037, 24-038, 24-021, and 24-035, seconded by?

00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:19,214
[SPEAKER_37]: Second.

193
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:20,955

00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:21,755
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

195
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:22,215
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

196
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:23,096
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

197
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:24,076
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

198
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:28,279
[SPEAKER_37]: So we have Judy Lonergan under public participation.

199
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,284
[SPEAKER_37]: You may come to the podium, Judy, and give your name and address for the record, please.

200
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:34,966
[SPEAKER_37]: And while you're on your way up, I did want to thank you.

201
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:36,867
[SPEAKER_37]: We haven't seen you since December.

202
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:41,711
[SPEAKER_37]: I know that you and many others organized the Jingle Bell Festival, a wonderful event for the city.

203
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:47,436
[SPEAKER_37]: We look forward to working with you and the committee to make sure it is a successful event once again.

204
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:48,917
[SPEAKER_75]: Thank you.

205
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:50,798
[SPEAKER_75]: My name is Judy Lonergan.

206
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:52,979
[SPEAKER_75]: I live at 34 Lincoln Road.

207
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,622
[SPEAKER_75]: I'd like to give you a brief history of what happened and why we're here.

208
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:07,566
[SPEAKER_75]: In 1999, a group of Medford women decided that they wanted to run a function, an event, to recognize the fact that the song Jingle Bells was written in Medford.

209
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:12,729
[SPEAKER_75]: We decided that it would be a free event that anyone in the community could attend.

210
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:18,592
[SPEAKER_75]: We had plans in place, but we had no place to hold it.

211
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,735
[SPEAKER_75]: I went to see Mayor McGlynn, who at the time I was not really that friendly with.

212
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,937
[SPEAKER_75]: I explained our problem to him, and I asked him if he could think of a place.

213
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:30,800
[SPEAKER_75]: He brought me into the council chamber and said that we could have it here.

214
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,281
[SPEAKER_75]: That's how it started.

215
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:41,448
[SPEAKER_75]: This festival started in 1999 when Community Family purchased the historical old railroad station on Washington Street from the city.

216
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:48,454
[SPEAKER_75]: My husband, John, was on the board at that time and suggested that Community Family become the beneficiary of this event.

217
00:14:49,115 --> 00:14:53,378
[SPEAKER_75]: Community Family is the first licensed adult care facility in the state.

218
00:14:54,139 --> 00:15:00,302
[SPEAKER_75]: Before they purchased the railroad station, the program was held in the basement of the West Medford Baptist Church for years.

219
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:06,404
[SPEAKER_75]: This agency provides direct service care to those who have been diagnosed with severe Alzheimer's.

220
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:11,686
[SPEAKER_75]: They provide medically-based services along with transportation activities and meals.

221
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:23,031
[SPEAKER_75]: I don't need to tell you that services like this keep our loved ones, friends, and neighbors aging in their homes where they want to be, not institutionalized in a skilled nursing home facility.

222
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:26,156
[SPEAKER_75]: There are three community family centers.

223
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:29,479
[SPEAKER_75]: One is in Everett, one is in Melrose, and the Medford Center.

224
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:35,163
[SPEAKER_75]: The Medford Center caters to those affected with highest level of Alzheimer's.

225
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,866
[SPEAKER_75]: Clients leave to go either to a nursing home or they die.

226
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:48,274
[SPEAKER_75]: The festival has grown in size every year, and over these 25 years, we have been able to donate almost $450,000 due to the generosity of sponsors, ads, donors, and chances.

227
00:15:52,901 --> 00:16:04,587
[SPEAKER_75]: They use the proceeds to assist with the purchase of vans, construct a new kitchen, develop a large outdoor space where the clients can spend time in nice weather, and help to renovate the center.

228
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:08,168
[SPEAKER_75]: This event is free to any family to attend.

229
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:13,471
[SPEAKER_75]: If they want to purchase chances, they can buy 20 for $5, and then the prices go up.

230
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:21,135
[SPEAKER_75]: This year, a mother came in with two children, and she bought chances with four single dollars and four quarters.

231
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:26,680
[SPEAKER_75]: But it gave her the opportunity to have her children be involved in an event for Christmas.

232
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,483
[SPEAKER_75]: And this is the biggest event in Medford for this Christmas holidays.

233
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:35,488
[SPEAKER_75]: And if someone came in and they couldn't even afford $5, they would be included.

234
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,249
[SPEAKER_75]: We would do whatever we could to help them.

235
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:45,816
[SPEAKER_75]: Our volunteers decorate City Hall for the month of December, which is still out there, and the city uses our decorations.

236
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:49,178
[SPEAKER_75]: The festival starts on Wednesday night for the lighting of the tree.

237
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,520
[SPEAKER_75]: Afterwards, everyone is invited inside.

238
00:16:51,940 --> 00:17:03,469
[SPEAKER_75]: These women work for seven solid days on the set, setting up, decorating, and cleaning up on Monday after summer volunteers in City Hall spend 40 hours

239
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:09,036
[SPEAKER_75]: having this function be extremely successful.

240
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:14,560
[SPEAKER_75]: The festival does not cost the city one cent other than the use of this chambers.

241
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:22,165
[SPEAKER_75]: We have purchased the tablecloth as well as paying for the rental of all the tables and chairs and paying for the janitorial services.

242
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:29,370
[SPEAKER_75]: It has recently been brought to our attention that some members of this city council do not want us to use City Hall any longer.

243
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,653
[SPEAKER_75]: One feels that it is disruptive and one feels that we are not inclusive enough.

244
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:34,694
[SPEAKER_75]: We have had

245
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,965
[SPEAKER_75]: Members, we have been always on display for chances.

246
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:47,408
[SPEAKER_75]: We have included every church, the Buddhist Center, the Royal House, Chevalier, most recently the new library as part of the tours on Saturday night.

247
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:52,790
[SPEAKER_75]: This year, Barbara Rothstein, who is an active member of the temple, had her home on the tour.

248
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,472
[SPEAKER_75]: What reason does this council have to desire that the event be discontinued?

249
00:17:58,652 --> 00:18:02,573
[SPEAKER_75]: We hope that you will reconsider and allow this community event to continue.

250
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:03,373
[SPEAKER_75]: Thank you.

251
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:04,674
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Judy.

252
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:12,891
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to recognize Councillor Scarpelli in just a minute.

253
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:16,313
[SPEAKER_37]: Could you not hear Judy?

254
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:20,336
[SPEAKER_37]: I got it.

255
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,180
[SPEAKER_37]: Just want to say, you know, I don't think the intent of this council whatsoever is to move or cancel the event.

256
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:33,025
[SPEAKER_37]: I can't speak for where those rumors have come from, but they have not come from this council or any official statement.

257
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:36,053
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, they are not accurate.

258
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:36,973
[SPEAKER_37]: Councillor Scarpelli.

259
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:37,313
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

260
00:18:37,353 --> 00:18:43,256
[SPEAKER_32]: So I know that, first of all, I care very deeply for a lot of our members.

261
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,496
[SPEAKER_32]: I respect you.

262
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:50,999
[SPEAKER_32]: And I will tell you that having deep conversations with my fellow Councillors, that's not the intent of this Council.

263
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:57,645
[SPEAKER_32]: we'll do everything that needs to be done to make sure that event comes through every single year.

264
00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:58,966
[SPEAKER_32]: It's too important for our community.

265
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:05,372
[SPEAKER_32]: In today's society, where we lack a true sense of community at times, that event brings everybody together.

266
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,895
[SPEAKER_32]: So I don't know where where that might have come from.

267
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:13,540
[SPEAKER_32]: But I will tell you, we will work hard together as a board to make sure that that's not something that's going to ever be forgotten.

268
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:16,063
[SPEAKER_32]: And and we understand how hard you work.

269
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:26,871
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that comes that evening that happens a lot of miscommunication and a lot of misunderstanding what was coming from the administration, the council, and your organization.

270
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:31,034
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think all it says is really having an open line of communication.

271
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:36,759
[SPEAKER_32]: I know that Judy's working really hard with the mayor's office to set up a meeting with different clergy and different churches.

272
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:39,541
[SPEAKER_32]: I know that the council president would probably love to be involved.

273
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:47,228
[SPEAKER_32]: to make sure that we're all together to make sure that this is an all-inclusive and a true celebration the way that you intended for.

274
00:19:47,248 --> 00:19:56,797
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that you know I brought my kids to the event when they were babies and it's something that to this day they still remember the Christmas trees and not for what what

275
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:01,821
[SPEAKER_32]: what the symbol of it but what it meant for the city and that was really unifying us.

276
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:14,549
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think that we so appreciate everything you do and I appreciate that you even had to come up here and share what you had to because there might have been some negative

277
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,991
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm glad you were here.

278
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:19,871
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm glad that we got it.

279
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,853
[SPEAKER_32]: We had a chance to speak, get the word out.

280
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:34,437
[SPEAKER_32]: And really, I think most importantly, is rally around as a council as an organization as a city to do more of these type of functions, because they're so important to what we're doing here.

281
00:20:34,877 --> 00:20:40,319
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, you want to talk about we have a room full of people that want to that are looking for true inclusion and peace and happiness.

282
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:42,240
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that you're you're

283
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:44,480
[SPEAKER_32]: You're the originators.

284
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:51,745
[SPEAKER_32]: You've been doing this before people were looking for where to look, where there's peace and love and happiness.

285
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:59,770
[SPEAKER_32]: So you are, in my eyes, the cornerstone of what we all should fight for.

286
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:09,257
[SPEAKER_32]: So again, I'm sorry that there was any negative words that came out in discussions, but rest assured, I've talked to Council President

287
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,627
[SPEAKER_32]: We're gonna work very hard to make sure this doesn't change.

288
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:15,828
[SPEAKER_32]: And now, I think that it's out there now.

289
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:34,451
[SPEAKER_32]: I would love to see so many other of our churches and our synagogues and our different affiliations and partners throughout the community really rally around this event so we can use this as a true teaching moment for everybody and really celebrate that amazing event.

290
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:38,652
[SPEAKER_32]: I know that still hundreds of kids show up every year

291
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:53,324
[SPEAKER_32]: And you didn't mention how much money goes out, Mrs. Lonergan, but I know you're talking to the hundreds of thousands that were raised and that were distributed to so many families that needed it and so many organizations that need it.

292
00:21:53,824 --> 00:22:00,550
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think it's to the point now, we don't have enough room for the people that want to donate Christmas trees so they can.

293
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,831
[SPEAKER_32]: And what's the intent of the tree?

294
00:22:02,392 --> 00:22:04,434
[SPEAKER_32]: People don't realize you can hold what?

295
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,034
[SPEAKER_32]: more prizes on it.

296
00:22:06,214 --> 00:22:08,575
[SPEAKER_32]: So you get more money and more donations that can come in.

297
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:10,716
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's one of the intents for it.

298
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:13,097
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that people didn't realize how important that is.

299
00:22:13,537 --> 00:22:22,900
[SPEAKER_32]: It's really just a mechanism to really stress the importance of gathering funds to support different initiatives throughout the community.

300
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,820
[SPEAKER_32]: So, um,

301
00:22:25,573 --> 00:22:27,354
[SPEAKER_32]: You know how I feel about all of you personally.

302
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:39,219
[SPEAKER_32]: I've known all of you probably my whole life, and I think that I'm proud to call you my friend, but I will tell you, as a council, I didn't hear, I haven't heard one negative thing moving forward with anything we're trying to do.

303
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,921
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we're all one team, making sure that we're gonna spread this love.

304
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:43,561
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you.

305
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:45,582
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, and I know how many gifts.

306
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:47,283
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Sanford.

307
00:22:49,226 --> 00:22:50,247
[SPEAKER_37]: I know how many gifts go out.

308
00:22:50,387 --> 00:22:54,030
[SPEAKER_37]: I know I was a youth volunteer at the Buddy Cohalent Center myself.

309
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:58,635
[SPEAKER_37]: My family has faced the tragedy of Alzheimer's, so I understand how important it is.

310
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:02,078
[SPEAKER_37]: If there's any meetings that I can represent the council at, I'd be happy to do so.

311
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:04,480
[SPEAKER_37]: From here on out, we're gonna keep it to two minutes.

312
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,843
[SPEAKER_37]: Judy had a petition, so she went in advance, but name and address for the record, please.

313
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:10,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Loretta Tusa, 45 Metcalf Street.

314
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli for your words.

315
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:20,031
[SPEAKER_02]: and to the council, who I hope is gonna support us wholeheartedly in this effort that's been going on for over 20 years.

316
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:23,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little speech, won't take long, couple of minutes.

317
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:34,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a retired 37-year educator of the Medford Public Schools, former board member of Medford Health Matters, and a member of the Jingle Bell Committee.

318
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to address the use of City Hall to host the festival.

319
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:56,677
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the Medford residents who through their federal taxes, state taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, local food tax, and community taxes fund the operation of the House of the People City Council.

320
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:19,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And on a final note, the festival committee here has, over the last 20 plus years, given their heart, souls, time, and money to raise thousands of dollars to fund the community center to provide a warm and welcoming place for seniors with special needs to spend their time comfortably.

321
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the opportunity to express my thoughts.

322
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:37,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody.

323
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,771
[SPEAKER_37]: Hi, name and address for the record, please.

324
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:41,732
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Angela Sperduto, 27 Memorial Way.

325
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:43,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

326
00:24:45,494 --> 00:24:47,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my name is Angela Sperduto.

327
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:51,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a member of the Jingle Bell Festival for 20 years.

328
00:24:53,019 --> 00:25:00,063
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad, Cosmo Sperduto, was a client at the Community Family Adult Day Health Center for almost a decade.

329
00:25:01,504 --> 00:25:04,726
[SPEAKER_03]: The love I have for my father could not be put into words.

330
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:08,315
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the most important person in my life.

331
00:25:10,936 --> 00:25:13,177
[SPEAKER_03]: He had late stage advanced Alzheimer's.

332
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:16,277
[SPEAKER_03]: He lost his motor skills and ability to speak.

333
00:25:17,338 --> 00:25:24,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia that not only affects your loved one, it affects the whole entire family.

334
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,621
[SPEAKER_03]: As the primary caregiver of my dad, the physical and mental demands became very overwhelming.

335
00:25:33,697 --> 00:25:42,127
[SPEAKER_03]: To see my dad, who was so strong mentally and physically, become a shell of himself was more than most can handle.

336
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:50,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Not knowing where to turn for help, I was recommended to look into the community family for help and care for my dad.

337
00:25:51,783 --> 00:26:00,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Having to work every day as well as providing 24-hour care for my dad, this center was my savior.

338
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:03,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I refused to put my dad into a long-term facility.

339
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:09,933
[SPEAKER_03]: They educated me on the disease and the progression of its long-term daily effects to the brain.

340
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:17,377
[SPEAKER_03]: As they provided knowledge on the financial and legal issues that are involved with the Alzheimer's patient.

341
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:27,833
[SPEAKER_03]: He needed 100%, 24-hour care, never to be left alone, as he would be a danger to himself, and most importantly, other people.

342
00:26:27,994 --> 00:26:28,114
[SPEAKER_37]: Ms.

343
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,276
[SPEAKER_37]: Peduto, you have 30 seconds.

344
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:29,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

345
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:35,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the staff displayed a genuine concern for my dad.

346
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:39,623
[SPEAKER_03]: They called me many times with issues regarding my dad's health.

347
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:44,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time they were concerned about his health, they prevented more health issues.

348
00:26:44,725 --> 00:26:47,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I could not have asked for more kindness and professionalism.

349
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:53,029
[SPEAKER_03]: They truly became a second family to me, showing me love and emotional support until his passing.

350
00:26:53,996 --> 00:27:00,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart, as I will always be a member of this festival, and I want to give back as long as I can.

351
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:01,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

352
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:02,264
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

353
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:15,498
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

354
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:16,599
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

355
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:17,240
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes.

356
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:19,277
[SPEAKER_48]: My name is Val Camilio.

357
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,678
[SPEAKER_48]: I live in 223 Lawrence Road.

358
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:29,203
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm here in support of the continuation of the Jingle Bell Festival held here every year at Medford City Hall.

359
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:35,307
[SPEAKER_48]: It's difficult to take care of someone who suffers from dementia or Alzheimer's.

360
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:38,409
[SPEAKER_48]: It is not an ordinary 24-hour day.

361
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:43,933
[SPEAKER_48]: It is a 24-hour day of worry, stress, and what's about to come for them and the caregiver.

362
00:27:44,733 --> 00:28:03,040
[SPEAKER_48]: People who suffer from these disorders require constant supervision, you know preparation personal hygiene care and more families look for any outside support, help and services for their loved ones, much like a child daycare program, but they can be very costly.

363
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,444
[SPEAKER_48]: My mom was 78 years old when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

364
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:15,233
[SPEAKER_48]: As much as that family tried to care for her needs, it became impossible and difficult as we had our own families to care for.

365
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:17,255
[SPEAKER_48]: At the time my dad was 88 years old.

366
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:23,739
[SPEAKER_48]: And he did the best he could preparing nutritious meals and trying to keep her occupied and entertained.

367
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:26,380
[SPEAKER_48]: It soon became too much of a test for him as well.

368
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,522
[SPEAKER_48]: We looked for services in the area, and finally found community family in Medford.

369
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:38,945
[SPEAKER_48]: It was a relief to find temporary help allowing me and my family members, some comfort during our busy working days.

370
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:48,699
[SPEAKER_48]: We took mom to visit community family, and the administrator was welcoming, kind, warm, and attentive to my mom.

371
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:55,286
[SPEAKER_48]: My apprehensive mother looked at me and whispered, all these people are old.

372
00:28:56,006 --> 00:29:03,614
[SPEAKER_48]: In reality, the people were both young and old, men and women, rich and poor, and of mixed ethnicity.

373
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:07,597
[SPEAKER_48]: So you see, Alzheimer's does not discriminate.

374
00:29:08,817 --> 00:29:12,059
[SPEAKER_48]: On her first day, the administrator knew my mom loved to cook.

375
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:17,001
[SPEAKER_48]: So she took my mom into the kitchen and asked her if she would like to prepare lunch for the guests.

376
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:18,682
[SPEAKER_48]: My mom was eager to help.

377
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:22,444
[SPEAKER_48]: She became a community family member for five years.

378
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:25,666
[SPEAKER_48]: She started three days a week and eventually went to four.

379
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:28,268
[SPEAKER_48]: My mom actually thought she was working there.

380
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:32,471
[SPEAKER_48]: The staff at the facility were kind, patient and caring to everyone.

381
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:39,336
[SPEAKER_48]: They also had a nurse on staff, and beyond administering medications, she would even give baths for those who needed it.

382
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:48,745
[SPEAKER_48]: They had wonderful days planned with activities, games, singing songs, exercise, nutritious lunch and snacks, and they celebrated everyone's birthday.

383
00:29:49,485 --> 00:30:02,330
[SPEAKER_48]: In addition to the wonderful care provided to our community, family provided transportation to and from the facility if it was needed, with a van that was purchased from monies received from the Jingle Bell Festival.

384
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:03,231
[SPEAKER_37]: Ma'am, thank you.

385
00:30:03,391 --> 00:30:05,112
[SPEAKER_37]: Your time is up, but your message has been heard.

386
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:06,072
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm sorry?

387
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:06,992
[SPEAKER_37]: Your time is up.

388
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:08,593
[SPEAKER_37]: We have a two-minute limit.

389
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:10,557
[SPEAKER_48]: I only have another minute.

390
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:17,120
[SPEAKER_48]: My mom thrived there and my dad and other family members had a safe place for mom to go for daycare.

391
00:30:23,183 --> 00:30:27,605
[SPEAKER_48]: I can show attention to all the people who came there for services.

392
00:30:28,185 --> 00:30:32,127
[SPEAKER_48]: They never got frustrated and was beyond anything I could ever imagine.

393
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:38,066
[SPEAKER_48]: The community family always went over and above what they needed to do.

394
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:41,707
[SPEAKER_48]: It is the type of care that you would never receive anywhere else.

395
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:44,508
[SPEAKER_48]: They are truly devoted to these people.

396
00:30:45,108 --> 00:30:50,209
[SPEAKER_48]: I am proud to have helped raise money for the community family through the Jingle Bell Festival.

397
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:56,411
[SPEAKER_48]: I would never be able to repay them for the care they gave my mom in the five years she spent there.

398
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:06,268
[SPEAKER_48]: We are so fortunate to have wonderful caring facility in Medford to help our community with respite care and have a safe place to bring our loved ones.

399
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:06,849
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you ma'am.

400
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,331
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor saying I'll be very brief.

401
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:25,437
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's really important to clarify that this council has no plans has had no plans and we'll have no plans to cancel the jingle ball event.

402
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:29,459
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe that this arises out of a misunderstanding that.

403
00:31:30,774 --> 00:31:39,737
[SPEAKER_28]: of miscommunication that happened a few months ago, but having spoken to some, at least the councillors I've spoken to, there are no plans to cancel this event.

404
00:31:40,157 --> 00:31:43,598
[SPEAKER_28]: And the council supports the mission of the Jingle Bell event as well.

405
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:48,580
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councillor Seng, and I really do ask that everyone please respect the rules of the council and my role as chair.

427

[SPEAKER_37]: If there's anything you'd like to say.

428
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,063
[SPEAKER_15]: None at all.

429
00:34:06,923 --> 00:34:09,145
[SPEAKER_15]: You did a good job, Mr. President.

430
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:09,806
[SPEAKER_15]: And I love it.

431
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:10,786
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.

432
00:34:10,806 --> 00:34:25,758
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing we're going to add is in addition to that presentation, we provided the council an election calendar year that will cover the match, that will cover September, that will cover November.

433
00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:28,660
[SPEAKER_15]: The commission will come back again.

434
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,601
[SPEAKER_15]: We love you so much.

435
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:30,201
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll come back.

436
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:34,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we have to come back to present the warrant and the police

437
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:37,688
[SPEAKER_15]: for acceptance after that, nothing else.

438
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:46,657
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be, we get our schedule, it's noted on the calendar, which will be posted the next two days after presented to you.

439
00:34:47,258 --> 00:34:47,818
[SPEAKER_15]: We're good to go.

440
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:50,000
[SPEAKER_37]: Wonderful, thank you, Mr. Chair.

441
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:52,403
[SPEAKER_37]: Member DiBenedetto, anything?

442
00:34:52,711 --> 00:35:02,654
[SPEAKER_34]: just happy that we're not moving for two and that we're able to maintain that location at Wakling Court for the primary election coming up.

443
00:35:02,674 --> 00:35:13,958
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be a sin if I don't think personally, through the chair, council saying, you know, he brought blessing to us and he's done a lot of work with us, okay?

444
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:15,919
[SPEAKER_15]: We get Wakling Court.

445
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:19,060
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know how much longer we're gonna have it, but we have it for much.

446
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:20,991
[SPEAKER_37]: Fantastic.

447
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:24,434
[SPEAKER_37]: On the call to election, any comments from members of the council?

448
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:25,275
[SPEAKER_37]: Councillor Saini.

449
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:29,519
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanted to thank you.

450
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:33,183
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just happy to see that we were able to get Walkling Court for this election.

451
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:41,631
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sure we'll be working a lot more moving forward on future ideas for polling locations and how we can make things work for our senior residents.

452
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:42,609
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

453
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:43,430
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

454
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,692
[SPEAKER_37]: On this one, since it's a call for election, I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.

455
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:58,059
[SPEAKER_37]: So on the motion to issue the call for election, to order the election by the, is there a motion to approve by Councilor Sang, seconded by Vice President Collins.

456
00:35:58,099 --> 00:35:59,180
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

457
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:13,121
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

458
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:13,241
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

459
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:13,482
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

460
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:13,622
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

461
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:14,163
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

462
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:15,144
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

463
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:15,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

464
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,091
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-038, which is the election calendar.

465
00:36:32,151 --> 00:36:34,192
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm just going to quickly read it if I get anything wrong.

466
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:35,232
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not gonna read the whole thing.

467
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:38,333
[SPEAKER_37]: You can find it on the city website, but there are three elections this year.

468
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:45,876
[SPEAKER_37]: There's the presidential primary, March 5th, and there are seven days of early voting before that on the 24th, 25th, 26th, 26th, 27th, 28th.

469
00:36:45,896 --> 00:36:46,836
[SPEAKER_37]: Leap year, 29th, and 1st of March.

470
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:48,317
[SPEAKER_37]: And then the election is March 5th.

471
00:36:48,337 --> 00:36:50,238
[SPEAKER_37]: There's a state primary on September 3rd.

472
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:01,943
[SPEAKER_37]: There's seven days of early voting for that.

473
00:37:02,484 --> 00:37:04,786
[SPEAKER_37]: And then there is the general election on November 5th, 2024.

474
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:09,769
[SPEAKER_37]: And there's at least two weeks, 14 days of early voting for that.

475
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,171
[SPEAKER_37]: So that's the election calendar.

476
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:15,794
[SPEAKER_37]: And that can be found at the elections commission at medford-ma.gov.

477
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:22,259
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion to receive and place on file, Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

478
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:22,980
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

479
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,201
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

480
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:25,402
[SPEAKER_37]: The motion passes.

481
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:30,353
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-021.

482
00:37:32,735 --> 00:37:35,997
[SPEAKER_37]: Resolution to support adult access and education for plant medicine.

483
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:40,680
[SPEAKER_37]: Offered by Councilor Lemming and Councilor Callahan.

484
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:54,711
[SPEAKER_37]: Whereas the so-called war on drugs has led to unnecessary penalization, arrest, and incarceration of vulnerable people, particularly people of color and people of limited financial means, rather than prioritizing harm reduction policies to treat drug abuse as an issue of public health.

485
00:37:55,131 --> 00:38:05,815
[SPEAKER_37]: And whereas ethniogenic plants and fungi such as psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca, ibogaine, and mescaline-containing cacti have been shown by peer-reviewed studies and indigenous practice to be beneficial,

486
00:38:06,335 --> 00:38:12,884
[SPEAKER_37]: for treating spiritual trauma, addiction, PTSD, depression, terminal illness, anxiety, and cluster headaches, among other conditions.

487
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:22,556
[SPEAKER_37]: And whereas, on average, we lose one of our neighbors in the Commonwealth to opioid overdose every week, as thousands of people we love struggle with addictions that ethniogenic plant medicine has been shown to alleviate,

488
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:37,939
[SPEAKER_37]: And whereas seven Massachusetts communities, Somerville, Cambridge, Northampton, Easthampton, Amherst, Salem, and Provincetown, and nearly two dozen cities nationwide have passed measures directing an end to arrests for growing and sharing these plant medicines, embracing their inferred constitutional right to regulate public safety.

489
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,600
[SPEAKER_37]: That is outlined in the U.S.

490
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,121
[SPEAKER_37]: Department of Justice's Cole Memorandum that permitted localities to deprioritize enforcement of cannabis.

491
00:38:44,981 --> 00:39:05,721
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh boy, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hereby maintains the use and possession of all controlled substances should be understood first and primarily as an issue of public health and by all town entities and that no Medford employees should use any should emanate to city resources, city entities and city resources to assist in enforcement of laws criminalizing personal controlled substance possession.

492
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,223
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there a motion to waive the remainder of the reading?

493
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:10,085
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion.

494
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:14,092
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

495
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:14,813
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

496
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:15,294
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

497
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:16,295
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Lemming?

498
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:18,724
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, thank you.

499
00:39:18,764 --> 00:39:25,552
[SPEAKER_30]: So this is, I'd like to thank the council for considering this very long text.

500
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:31,398
[SPEAKER_30]: Essentially, this is just a resolution to decriminalize plant-based medicine.

501
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:35,103
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, these are not the same as opioids that cause a public health crisis.

502
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:39,847
[SPEAKER_30]: They are non-addictive.

503
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:45,350
[SPEAKER_30]: They have been shown to be able to treat things like PTSD and addiction.

504
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:51,894
[SPEAKER_30]: This has already been done, as it said, by seven other Massachusetts communities, so we would be the eighth.

505
00:39:51,954 --> 00:40:00,118
[SPEAKER_30]: This is meant to first encourage local law enforcement to deprioritize this issue.

506
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:03,060
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't believe that this council has the authority to outright

507
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:15,011
[SPEAKER_30]: to decriminalize it, and it is meant to support the state-level initiative to do just that, which is currently being sponsored in the Massachusetts Senate by Senator Jalen.

508
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:23,078
[SPEAKER_30]: Just to clarify one part of this and offer a little bit of context is in the part of the reading that was waived.

509
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:27,562
[SPEAKER_30]: This resolution calls that the Bedford City Council, sorry,

510
00:40:28,543 --> 00:40:57,671
[SPEAKER_30]: to do well so okay so basically there are there's just for a little bit of context there are a couple of different ways to decriminalize this one of them and another avenue that is currently being pursued is a signature collection method which would basically create a an unelected commission that would add its own that if passed in massachusetts would add its own regulation to these plant medicines this has already been passed in

511
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:04,735
[SPEAKER_30]: Oregon, and long story short, it's made the price of these plant medicines go between $1,000 and $3,000.

512
00:41:05,316 --> 00:41:16,543
[SPEAKER_30]: So doing things this way through elected representatives would just help to decriminalize it and not create this sort of artificial price.

513
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:25,509
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think that this is a very important step forward to creating a nuanced and science-backed drug policy in the state of Massachusetts.

514
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,550
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'd like to thank this council for considering it.

515
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:29,852
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

516
00:41:29,872 --> 00:41:30,733
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Callahan.

517
00:41:32,194 --> 00:41:34,036
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Lemming spoke quite well on this.

518
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:37,559
[SPEAKER_19]: Really, this is a, remember, this is a resolution.

519
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,621
[SPEAKER_19]: This is not an ordinance that we are passing.

520
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:54,375
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a statement of the views of the council on not prioritizing our law enforcement to spend resources, to arrest and, you know,

521
00:41:55,336 --> 00:42:02,639
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, sent for incarceration, people who simply have possession of such controlled substances.

522
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:15,645
[SPEAKER_19]: So given that and what Councillor Lemming said, I believe this resolution is a fairly reasonable state and there are many other cities that have passed something very similar.

523
00:42:17,276 --> 00:42:18,337
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

524
00:42:18,377 --> 00:42:19,819
[SPEAKER_32]: Councilor Scarpelli?

525
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:20,660
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Councilor Villescaz.

526
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:38,219
[SPEAKER_32]: I think any time that we present a resolution or an ordinance that has a level of detail that we talk about law enforcement, I think it'd be prudent for us to maybe send this to subcommittee, invite the chief or someone in his stead to give us their input as our, um,

527
00:42:39,361 --> 00:42:50,896
[SPEAKER_32]: the city of Medford to make sure that what we're voting on has the best interests of our police department and our safety of our citizens.

528
00:42:50,956 --> 00:42:54,160
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that it would be, um, it would be, um.

529
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,641
[SPEAKER_32]: a prudent solution to move this forward to get a little bit more information.

530
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:16,369
[SPEAKER_32]: What I read is, you know, it's information that's gathered, but I'd like to get more information before I would vote on this and really get the input of the chief where it's mentioned a few times that

531
00:43:18,035 --> 00:43:21,856
[SPEAKER_32]: the ramifications through the police department and getting their input.

532
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:26,477
[SPEAKER_32]: So I would recommend that we would move this to one of the subcommittees, Mr. President.

533
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:32,559
[SPEAKER_37]: I said a motion to refer to the public health and community safety.

534
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:33,159
[SPEAKER_32]: That'd be perfect.

535
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:37,760
[SPEAKER_32]: And with that ask a representative from the police department there to share their input.

536
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,001
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

537
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:38,341
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

538
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:40,781
[SPEAKER_37]: With the representative from the police department.

539
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:41,862
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by councilor Zaro.

540
00:43:41,902 --> 00:43:42,882
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there further discussion?

541
00:43:42,902 --> 00:43:45,983
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Collins.

542
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,282
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, President Behrs.

543
00:43:49,622 --> 00:43:51,703
[SPEAKER_65]: I appreciate my fellow counselors for bringing this forward.

544
00:43:51,723 --> 00:43:53,885
[SPEAKER_65]: I certainly will be comfortable supporting the resolution tonight.

545
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:58,508
[SPEAKER_65]: I think it's also fine to discuss it more with relevant stakeholders and community members.

546
00:43:59,008 --> 00:44:09,975
[SPEAKER_65]: For me, putting aside the medical and therapeutic uses associated with psychedelic plants, it's certainly not my belief that drug-related arrests and prosecutions should be a law enforcement priority, except when it comes to

547
00:44:10,535 --> 00:44:18,818
[SPEAKER_65]: some of the things specifically exempted in the resolution, such as unauthorized commercial sale, distribution of minors, driving under the influence.

548
00:44:19,978 --> 00:44:26,700
[SPEAKER_65]: Recent history, I mean, not so recent history has shown us that criminalization of substances does not meaningfully advance public health and public safety.

549
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,262
[SPEAKER_65]: At the same time, this is a holistic issue, so I look forward to future discussion about it.

550
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:31,762
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you.

551
00:44:32,662 --> 00:44:35,603
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

552
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:42,830
[SPEAKER_37]: Was your microphone on?

553
00:44:44,111 --> 00:44:44,431
[SPEAKER_37]: It's on.

554
00:44:44,612 --> 00:44:45,172
[SPEAKER_37]: The light's on.

555
00:44:50,335 --> 00:44:50,635
[SPEAKER_37]: All right.

556
00:44:50,695 --> 00:44:50,915
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

557
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:51,456
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

558
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:52,376
[SPEAKER_37]: Shane.

559
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:55,018
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Shane.

560
00:44:55,198 --> 00:44:55,798
[SPEAKER_37]: Shane said yes.

561
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:57,319
[SPEAKER_37]: You couldn't hear him either, but I did.

562
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,442
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further comment from members of the council?

563
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:03,563
[SPEAKER_37]: Sorry, Mr. Cassidy, one moment.

564
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,991
[SPEAKER_37]: Seeing none, we will take public participation.

565
00:45:07,091 --> 00:45:08,352
[SPEAKER_37]: Two minutes each on the issue.

566
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:11,893
[SPEAKER_37]: If you'd like to speak on this issue, you may line up at the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

567
00:45:11,913 --> 00:45:13,894
[SPEAKER_37]: We will alternate between the podium and Zoom.

568
00:45:14,354 --> 00:45:14,875
[SPEAKER_37]: Two minutes.

569
00:45:19,045 --> 00:45:20,286
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

570
00:45:20,586 --> 00:45:22,446
[SPEAKER_27]: Patrick clerkin 50 Princeton Street.

571
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:28,109
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd like to start off by commending counselors Callahan and lemming for putting this motion forward.

572
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:41,154
[SPEAKER_27]: I am pretty passionate about history and I have learned about the history of the Cold War and the war on drugs and how they relate to this particular issue of entheogenic and psychedelic substances.

573
00:45:42,154 --> 00:45:57,750
[SPEAKER_27]: And I started really getting into this when I started noticing the trends and rises in depression and anxiety, chronic depression and anxiety, deaths of despair, the opioid crisis, as mentioned.

574
00:45:59,231 --> 00:46:00,011
[SPEAKER_27]: PTSD.

575
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:23,737
[SPEAKER_27]: And I heard about these trials that were being done at John Hopkins University, my curiosity, a lot of the people that suffered from these things saying that this was using some of these substances really psychologically healed them in a way that some of these holistically healed them in a way that some of these more kind of reductionists artificially derived substances like, like,

576
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,779
[SPEAKER_27]: oxycontin would not do.

577
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:35,905
[SPEAKER_27]: And so I thought to myself, if I'm going to potentially advocate for these, I want to know more about them directly.

578
00:46:36,465 --> 00:46:39,608
[SPEAKER_27]: Long story short, I myself ended up trying them.

579
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:50,417
[SPEAKER_27]: I tried ayahuasca several times, I tried 5-MeO-DMT psilocybin, and I come up here not to just drop that in front of everyone, but to say that

580
00:46:51,838 --> 00:47:04,694
[SPEAKER_27]: I can speak personally to their possibilities and their limitations, and I would put myself forward as someone who would help you to advance this.

581
00:47:04,934 --> 00:47:06,056
[SPEAKER_27]: So, thank you.

582
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:07,077
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

583
00:47:08,038 --> 00:47:15,164
[SPEAKER_37]: And I apologize that we, I've been working on an RFP to fix the sound system in this room for several months, and I'm very frustrated that it hasn't been done yet.

584
00:47:15,204 --> 00:47:26,513
[SPEAKER_37]: We do have hearing assistance devices available, and I believe the City Messenger and our videographer can provide those to assist if the sound quality in the room is not sufficient for people who are in attendance.

585
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,157
[SPEAKER_37]: No hands on Zoom, so we'll go to the podium.

586
00:47:31,217 --> 00:47:32,438
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

587
00:47:34,076 --> 00:47:36,979
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll speak loud so everyone can hear me too.

588
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:43,586
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is James Davis and I live at 9 Cardington Street in Boston in Roxbury.

589
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:55,658
[SPEAKER_25]: And over the past two years, I've had the pleasure of meeting your neighbors, knocking on their doors, standing outside your lovely supermarkets to discuss psilocybin mushrooms and plant medicines.

590
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,340
[SPEAKER_25]: They are nurses.

591
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,961
[SPEAKER_25]: They are parents.

592
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:01,002
[SPEAKER_25]: They are fellow baseball coaches.

593
00:48:01,663 --> 00:48:12,430
[SPEAKER_25]: They are people who have found unbelievable healing from these plant medicines in a way that pharmaceutical drugs have not offered people an alternative.

594
00:48:13,251 --> 00:48:26,639
[SPEAKER_25]: Psilocybin mushrooms are the most studied pharmacological compound in US history, with thousands of studies published on their benefits and indigenous uses prior to their criminalization in 1970.

595
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:35,724
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, they were criminalized because a whole generation that was being sent to Vietnam to die and fight a war that they did not agree with,

596
00:48:36,991 --> 00:48:43,936
[SPEAKER_25]: The government saw criminalizing cannabis and psychedelics as a way to target certain people politically.

597
00:48:44,477 --> 00:48:45,858
[SPEAKER_25]: And indeed, it has.

598
00:48:46,438 --> 00:48:49,060
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the history of US drug policy.

599
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:58,888
[SPEAKER_25]: A study of 44,000 Americans found that a single use of psilocybin mushrooms reduces the risk of opiate use disorder by 40%.

600
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:11,818
[SPEAKER_25]: We are finding first responders, active military members, who are finding unbelievable relief by taking even microdoses that do not have hallucinogenic effects.

601
00:49:12,098 --> 00:49:13,359
[SPEAKER_38]: You have 30 seconds, Mr. Davis.

602
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,240
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

603
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:24,869
[SPEAKER_25]: For me, for my brother, for my family, and for Medford families that are struggling with addiction to alcohol, with addiction to food, this is a godsend.

604
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:26,950
[SPEAKER_25]: And by decriminalizing this,

605
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:41,118
[SPEAKER_25]: You're saying to the people who are already growing their mushrooms, who are already talking to their therapist about it, that you don't want them to go to jail, and that this public health issue should not be a criminal one.

606
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:42,419
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

607
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:43,160
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

608
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:52,265
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further comment by members of the public or members on Zoom?

609
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:56,367
[SPEAKER_37]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, I'll go to any member in the room who would like to speak at the podium.

610
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:01,568
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Castaneda, name and address for the record, please.

611
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:04,851
[SPEAKER_22]: Andrew Castaneda, Christian on East Medford.

612
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:05,591
[SPEAKER_22]: You have two minutes.

613
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:07,913
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

614
00:50:09,594 --> 00:50:10,354
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll make a list.

615
00:50:11,715 --> 00:50:12,235
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you hear me?

616
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:23,363
[SPEAKER_22]: I am shocked and pleasantly surprised at this government finally catching on to try some other medicines that are totally natural.

617
00:50:25,404 --> 00:50:25,765
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course,

618
00:50:27,335 --> 00:50:30,836
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm hearing a lot of good stories, especially I believe Matt works for the Mass General.

619
00:50:30,856 --> 00:50:35,278
[SPEAKER_22]: He would know more than me because I'm a layman, although I'm a Woodstock graduate.

620
00:50:38,419 --> 00:50:48,403
[SPEAKER_22]: I am so excited to see there'll be some possible natural remedies to maybe 35% of the population is my guesstimate.

621
00:50:49,534 --> 00:51:01,460
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm sure I'm close, especially to my old buddies who are still alive, missing limbs with PTSD from the 1960s Vietnam War.

622
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:02,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Good luck.

623
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,362
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Mr. Castanetti.

624
00:51:05,802 --> 00:51:08,404
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further comments from members of the public?

625
00:51:09,364 --> 00:51:11,905
[SPEAKER_37]: I see Grace Parker on Zoom, and then I'll come back to the podium.

626
00:51:16,828 --> 00:51:18,248
[SPEAKER_37]: Grace, name and address for the record, please.

627
00:51:18,268 --> 00:51:18,949
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes.

628
00:51:19,738 --> 00:51:20,118
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

629
00:51:20,138 --> 00:51:21,559
[SPEAKER_45]: Hi, my name is Grace Parker.

630
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,600
[SPEAKER_45]: I live at 112 Bell Ave in Medford.

631
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:28,003
[SPEAKER_45]: I just wanted to express my support for what everyone has said so far.

632
00:51:28,023 --> 00:51:33,926
[SPEAKER_45]: I am a researcher in the psychedelics space and I just wanted to

633
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:40,772
[SPEAKER_45]: share that I'm also really glad to see that this resolution is being put forward.

634
00:51:40,872 --> 00:51:45,917
[SPEAKER_45]: There is so much evidence that these plant medicines are safe and they are so effective.

635
00:51:46,518 --> 00:51:54,165
[SPEAKER_45]: And so it's a huge unmet need, and I just would like to express my wholehearted support.

636
00:51:55,206 --> 00:51:55,547
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

637
00:51:56,668 --> 00:51:59,230
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Grace, and a model of a quick comment.

638
00:51:59,310 --> 00:51:59,611
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

639
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:02,753
[SPEAKER_37]: podium.

640
00:52:02,773 --> 00:52:04,034
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address of the record, please.

641
00:52:04,294 --> 00:52:04,595
[SPEAKER_36]: Sure thing.

642
00:52:04,795 --> 00:52:06,696
[SPEAKER_36]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Avenue, Medford.

643
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,278
[SPEAKER_36]: Councillor Lemming, are you still in the Navy?

644
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:11,222
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

645
00:52:11,663 --> 00:52:11,803
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay.

646
00:52:12,383 --> 00:52:18,867
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, so some of us are bound based on our jobs, so on and so forth, whether or not we can use controlled substances.

647
00:52:19,188 --> 00:52:19,768
[SPEAKER_36]: Isn't that correct?

648
00:52:19,788 --> 00:52:22,770
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, you have the UCMJ, which you have to abide by for certain rules.

649
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:25,252
[SPEAKER_36]: Others like FAA pilots, right?

650
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:27,433
[SPEAKER_36]: Anyone with a DOT license.

651
00:52:27,994 --> 00:52:29,054
[SPEAKER_36]: And there's a reason for that.

652
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:30,795
[SPEAKER_36]: And I'm not opposed to this at all.

653
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:34,358
[SPEAKER_36]: I guess I would just want to caution this council before we start.

654
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:39,881
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm concerned number one about distribution and what distribution means in your measure.

655
00:52:40,942 --> 00:52:45,529
[SPEAKER_36]: Because as the parent of a child I can tell you, I can't even give my toddler cough medicine.

656
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,231
[SPEAKER_36]: I wish I could.

657
00:52:47,852 --> 00:52:48,152
[SPEAKER_36]: I can't.

658
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:55,963
[SPEAKER_36]: So, I think there's some nuances that really need to be addressed which is why I'm glad that y'all are bringing it to committee, because there's always the unintended consequences.

659
00:52:57,086 --> 00:53:04,413
[SPEAKER_36]: And just to think about that there are reasons that sometimes people don't think of why certain things are controlled and this and that are certain situations.

660
00:53:05,173 --> 00:53:08,456
[SPEAKER_36]: So just before we wholeheartedly say this is great, everyone should have it all the time.

661
00:53:09,637 --> 00:53:16,123
[SPEAKER_36]: I really hope that the council will heed law enforcement and maybe others too, and that there's a time and a place for everything.

662
00:53:16,203 --> 00:53:20,867
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm not opposed to this, but I also don't like blankly saying, sure, it's great for everyone all the time.

663
00:53:21,027 --> 00:53:29,977
[SPEAKER_36]: because I'm pretty sure nobody would want the pilot of your airplane on a controlled substance at any period of time, especially if it's a psychedelic one.

664
00:53:30,317 --> 00:53:31,018
[SPEAKER_36]: That's all, thank you.

665
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:32,099
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Mr. Merritt.

666
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,002
[SPEAKER_37]: I will go to Councilor Lemming and then Councilor Kelly.

667
00:53:35,626 --> 00:53:38,007
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to clarify that.

668
00:53:38,307 --> 00:53:42,770
[SPEAKER_30]: So the US military is regulated federally.

669
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:46,732
[SPEAKER_30]: So I am personally subject to urinalysis several times a year.

670
00:53:46,772 --> 00:53:48,373
[SPEAKER_30]: So I haven't personally tried these things.

671
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:52,675
[SPEAKER_30]: But in my day job, I'm also a neuroscientist.

672
00:53:53,876 --> 00:53:57,077
[SPEAKER_30]: So I don't study plant medicine directly.

673
00:53:57,137 --> 00:53:58,538
[SPEAKER_30]: So my colleagues have.

674
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:00,919
[SPEAKER_30]: And I've talked with experts who have also

675
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:19,375
[SPEAKER_30]: uh specialize in this themselves so I would so I think that if you know if this were to go to committee for further discussion we like um I guess I guess my I guess my

676
00:54:21,142 --> 00:54:28,385
[SPEAKER_30]: My concern with that is that this is more of a statewide issue.

677
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:34,447
[SPEAKER_30]: And so it's really trying to support it at that level.

678
00:54:35,747 --> 00:54:42,289
[SPEAKER_30]: I would assume that if seven other Massachusetts towns have also passed similar resolutions, then they're

679
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:54,256
[SPEAKER_30]: their law enforcement is not so uniquely different from Medford that Medford has some unique public health considerations specific to this city.

680
00:54:54,996 --> 00:55:03,141
[SPEAKER_30]: So I and you know, if it were all if it were referred to committee, I would also encourage us to speak not only to law enforcement, but to also, um,

681
00:55:03,681 --> 00:55:12,526
[SPEAKER_30]: public health experts, people who specifically study this, people who specifically study this, and other stakeholders as well.

682
00:55:12,826 --> 00:55:23,012
[SPEAKER_30]: I personally would like it to be voted on tonight, but obviously if that isn't the will of this council, then it would go to committee.

683
00:55:24,633 --> 00:55:25,274
[SPEAKER_30]: Councillor Callahan.

684
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

685
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:36,712
[SPEAKER_19]: As a co sponsor of this, it clearly is important to me that we do consider the spirit of what we're trying to do here.

686
00:55:37,052 --> 00:55:42,118
[SPEAKER_19]: But I also want to mention that this is a fairly long resolution, and it includes a couple of state

687
00:55:44,076 --> 00:55:46,057
[SPEAKER_19]: recommendations about state policy.

688
00:55:46,437 --> 00:55:54,081
[SPEAKER_19]: And I want to ensure that other counselors have had the time to consider those policies and to consider the entire text.

689
00:55:55,122 --> 00:56:03,566
[SPEAKER_19]: And that I also mentioned this because I am the first in the alphabet, which means that I have to state what I'm going to do first.

690
00:56:04,307 --> 00:56:12,451
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's simply to say to my fellow counselors that I would definitely respect people's desires to have time and committee

691
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:14,643
[SPEAKER_19]: to understand the issue more.

692
00:56:14,723 --> 00:56:19,127
[SPEAKER_19]: And I will, as a co-sponsor, make sure that this does move through committee.

693
00:56:19,968 --> 00:56:26,214
[SPEAKER_19]: But I just want to state that I'd love to hear from other counselors in terms of whether sending it to committee is something that you would prefer.

694
00:56:29,215 --> 00:56:29,775
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Sang.

695
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:30,376
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

696
00:56:31,737 --> 00:56:44,826
[SPEAKER_28]: It's my reading of this resolution that it essentially is a recommendation for the city, for the police department on a policy, but it's not creating policy of our own.

697
00:56:45,226 --> 00:56:54,352
[SPEAKER_28]: And so I'd be fine voting with it tonight, especially seeing that the police chief will still be the final arbiter of what the policy is.

698
00:56:55,213 --> 00:56:55,433
[SPEAKER_28]: I think

699
00:56:55,993 --> 00:57:09,994
[SPEAKER_28]: We've talked a lot about the science of it, I'm not going to delve into that too deep, but I would be okay with this going either way tonight, either sending it to committee or to are just voting it out tonight, because it is essentially a.

700
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:17,820
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a rung above symbolic, but it's not us imposing policy.

701
00:57:19,341 --> 00:57:27,687
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's to the public comment earlier, I just looked up what the definitions of distribution are in these laws.

702
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:31,310
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't involve what we were afraid of.

703
00:57:31,851 --> 00:57:34,312
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't involve sale or anything like that.

704
00:57:34,653 --> 00:57:35,133
[SPEAKER_28]: And so

705
00:57:37,483 --> 00:57:49,652
[SPEAKER_28]: I or I guess I guess Yeah, so I would be happy with this going going forward, but I defer to the sponsors on the motion unless there's further comment.

706
00:57:50,773 --> 00:57:57,118
[SPEAKER_37]: The motion by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Lazaro to send this to committee public health and community safety committee.

707
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:01,842
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor.

708
00:58:01,862 --> 00:58:06,846
[SPEAKER_37]: I think that's for

709
00:58:09,244 --> 00:58:10,324
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm gonna ask for a roll call.

710
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,365
[SPEAKER_37]: I just, it's right down the middle.

711
00:58:13,626 --> 00:58:13,786
[SPEAKER_37]: Ms.

712
00:58:13,806 --> 00:58:18,567
[SPEAKER_37]: Clerk, please call the roll.

713
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:26,390
[SPEAKER_58]: To refer to committee.

714
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:28,391
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor Kelly.

715
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:29,071
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

716
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:32,272
[SPEAKER_58]: Vice President Collins.

717
00:58:33,193 --> 00:58:33,493
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

718
00:58:35,414 --> 00:58:36,314
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor Lazaro.

719
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:37,094
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

720
00:58:37,895 --> 00:58:38,395
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor Lemming.

721
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,033
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor Scarpello?

722
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:41,373
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

723
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:42,774
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor Sanchez?

724
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:43,054
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

725
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:44,574
[SPEAKER_58]: President Rivera?

726
00:58:44,694 --> 00:58:51,236
[SPEAKER_37]: No, if I'm in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes and the item is referred to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

727
00:58:51,256 --> 00:58:51,276
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-035.

728
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:56,197
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, Councilor Strunk?

729
00:58:56,977 --> 00:59:06,840
[SPEAKER_32]: I need to correct something, because I embarrassedly, I just got text with a couple of threats.

730
00:59:08,942 --> 00:59:12,064
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. O'Brien did not retire.

731
00:59:15,145 --> 00:59:18,767
[SPEAKER_32]: We received information from a colleague of his saying that he retired.

732
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:34,136
[SPEAKER_32]: But the truth of the matter is, Mrs. O'Brien sent me a message and said, no, George, Pat was given a circle of honor award for his safe driving in the city of Medford.

733
00:59:35,516 --> 00:59:36,377
[SPEAKER_32]: So please, Pat,

734
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:38,934
[SPEAKER_32]: I won't come home tonight.

735
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:40,875
[SPEAKER_32]: He is not retiring.

736
00:59:40,895 --> 00:59:43,756
[SPEAKER_32]: If someone could reach out to his bosses, he'll be in work tomorrow.

737
00:59:44,416 --> 00:59:45,496
[SPEAKER_32]: So please forgive me.

738
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:48,237
[SPEAKER_32]: I make one mistake a year and that was it.

739
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:48,877
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you.

740
00:59:49,097 --> 00:59:50,578
[SPEAKER_37]: We'll get that amended for the records.

741
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:58,620
[SPEAKER_37]: And for the public, if you would like to prank this council, email councilor.

742
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,141
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-035 offered by Vice President Collins.

743
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:02,821
[SPEAKER_37]: Resolution in support.

744
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,382
[SPEAKER_37]: Council Vice President Collins.

745
01:00:05,913 --> 01:00:06,774
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, President Behrs.

746
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:09,997
[SPEAKER_65]: I've put forward an amended version of the resolution.

747
01:00:10,017 --> 01:00:13,740
[SPEAKER_65]: I would motion to amend the resolution and adopt the revised language.

748
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:19,745
[SPEAKER_65]: A copy is in front of, sorry, a copy of the amended resolution is in front of all councilors and in the hands of the clerk.

749
01:00:19,785 --> 01:00:24,069
[SPEAKER_65]: I would motion to amend the resolution and adopt the new language and have it read into the record.

750
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:34,039
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion to amend the resolution to the copy before the council and the clerk, after which I will read it and it will be presented.

751
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:41,848
[SPEAKER_37]: So on the motion to use the amended language for the purposes of discussion of the paper by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

752
01:00:41,868 --> 01:00:42,509
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

753
01:00:42,529 --> 01:00:43,150
[SPEAKER_57]: Aye.

754
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:44,110
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

755
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,270
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

756
01:00:45,290 --> 01:01:07,615
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-035 offered by Vice President Collins, whereas the Medford City Council recognizes and affirms the sanctity, preciousness, and equality of all human life, and whereas on October 7, 2023, the terrorist group Hamas killed over 1,200 Israeli residents, took over 240 hostages, committed a terrific atrocities, displaced families, wreaked untold grief and trauma upon the civilian population of Israel,

757
01:01:08,075 --> 01:01:22,538
[SPEAKER_37]: and have continued to attack Israeli civilians, injuring hundreds in rocket attacks since October 7th, and whereas since those horrific attacks, the ongoing Israeli military campaign and blockade has created a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions in Gaza, and whereas since October 7th,

758
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:31,869
[SPEAKER_37]: The Israeli military has killed over 26,000 Palestinians in Gaza, injured over 62,000, and more than 85% of all Gaza residents have been displaced.

759
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:48,504
[SPEAKER_37]: And whereas the ongoing military campaign has had a horrific toll on civilians in Gaza, with UNICEF describing the Gaza Strip as the, quote, world's most dangerous place to be a child, and reporting that 40% of all deaths in Gaza have been deaths of children, and whereas the Israeli military has launched more than 22,000 airstrikes at Gaza,

760
01:01:50,586 --> 01:02:08,580
[SPEAKER_37]: resulting in the destruction of over 70% of all homes and schools, and most of its civilian infrastructure, including electricity, communications, water, sewer, and sanitation systems, with the World Health Organization reporting that all Gazan hospitals have been destroyed or seriously damaged, exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, and

761
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:32,468
[SPEAKER_37]: whereas the near total siege on Gaza has prevented the delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid, and whereas the World Food Program has reported that all 2.2 million people in Gaza are facing crisis levels of food insecurity, that one in four Gazans is facing catastrophic hunger, and that without an end to bombardment and resumption of humanitarian aid, famine will spread quickly across the population and

762
01:02:33,408 --> 01:03:02,445
[SPEAKER_37]: whereas humanitarian organizations report that the Israeli military kills an average of 250 Palestinians each day, almost all civilians, and that these deaths are a direct result of airstrikes, the blockade of basic food and medical aid, and the destruction of hospitals and basic shelter, which are war crimes, and whereas Hamas continues to hold over 100 Israeli civilians hostage and target Israeli civilians, which are war crimes, and whereas Israel continues to detain thousands of Palestinians who have never been charged with or convicted of a crime,

763
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,206
[SPEAKER_37]: including scores of children.

764
01:03:04,926 --> 01:03:21,637
[SPEAKER_37]: And whereas on October 26, 2023, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for an immediate, durable, and sustained humanitarian truce between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in Gaza, and numerous international humanitarian organizations have similarly called for a sustained ceasefire.

765
01:03:22,258 --> 01:03:31,204
[SPEAKER_37]: And whereas the previous ceasefire from November 24 to November 30, 2023, allowed for the release of some Israeli hostages, some Palestinian detainees,

766
01:03:31,804 --> 01:03:46,579
[SPEAKER_37]: and allowed emergency aid and fuel to enter Gaza and whereas the history of Israel and Palestine since 1948 includes systemic displacement of Palestinians and occupation of Palestine, the imposition of illegal blockades upon and denial of basic civil and human rights to Palestinian civilians.

767
01:03:47,680 --> 01:04:02,798
[SPEAKER_37]: ongoing and escalating terrorism and violent attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, and extremist violence aimed at Israeli civilians, and whereas many members of the Medford community are suffering from trauma, grief, shock, and fear compounded by recent

768
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:09,461
[SPEAKER_37]: increased incidence of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Palestinian racism, both nationally and locally.

769
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:25,305
[SPEAKER_37]: And whereas members of the Medford community, including Palestinians and Jews, are speaking out for peace in Israel and Palestine, and in support of a permanent bilateral ceasefire and a return of all hostages, innocent detainees, and political prisoners, now, therefore,

770
01:04:25,885 --> 01:04:36,769
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we support an enduring bilateral ceasefire in Israel and Gaza and the immediate return of all hostages, innocent detainees, and political prisoners.

771
01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:53,835
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we unequivocally condemn all violence against civilians, including the attacks by Hamas on October 7, 2023 against Israeli civilians, the Israeli military campaign against Gaza that continues to unleash disproportionate violence against Palestinian civilians,

772
01:04:54,415 --> 01:05:02,198
[SPEAKER_37]: attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, and all attacks by all parties against civilians.

773
01:05:02,518 --> 01:05:10,681
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we support the lifting of the blockade and the uninhibited provision of life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza.

774
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:13,422
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we

775
01:05:13,422 --> 01:05:33,957
[SPEAKER_37]: We affirm the inalienable right of all people to live in peace, free from fear of harm and prejudice, be it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we unequivocally condemn all xenophobic violence, attacks, and rhetoric, and affirm the inalienable right of all people to know safety and acceptance, regardless of their religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, or skin color.

776
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:51,617
[SPEAKER_37]: be it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we urge the Biden administration, the United States Senate, and the United States Congress to exert the full extent of their power, influence, and funding to bring about an enduring ceasefire, the uninhibited provision of humanitarian aid, and the release of all hostages and detained innocents,

777
01:05:52,318 --> 01:06:10,702
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be sent to each member of Medford's federal delegation, that's Senator Warren, Senator Markey, and Representative Clark, and to President Biden, urging them to use their power and influence to bring about a sustained and enduring ceasefire so as to protect and honor all human life.

778
01:06:11,242 --> 01:06:12,222
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Collins.

779
01:06:14,002 --> 01:06:14,822
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, President Behrs.

780
01:06:14,863 --> 01:06:17,103
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you for reading all of that into the record.

781
01:06:18,929 --> 01:06:25,951
[SPEAKER_65]: I want to briefly speak to why I'm putting forth an amended resolution from what was submitted to be incorporated in the Council's formal agenda.

782
01:06:26,771 --> 01:06:33,092
[SPEAKER_65]: After I put forward the resolution last week, I was contacted by many constituents who urged me to reconsider the language before us.

783
01:06:43,382 --> 01:06:51,047
[SPEAKER_65]: With an issue such as this, it is critical to speak with as much clarity and precision as possible, even when and especially when it's uncomfortable.

784
01:06:52,568 --> 01:07:00,452
[SPEAKER_65]: I was called upon to amend this resolution to more authentically and faithfully represent the harms endured on both sides of the Israel and Palestinian border.

785
01:07:01,173 --> 01:07:10,899
[SPEAKER_65]: In addition, while the ultimate ask of this resolution is for an immediate and enduring bilateral ceasefire, I was also called upon to not let the historical context go unsaid and unacknowledged.

786
01:07:11,539 --> 01:07:20,177
[SPEAKER_65]: I thank everybody who got in touch with me from the original request to put forward a ceasefire resolution to the many people who gave me feedback and worked with me to improve it.

787
01:07:31,323 --> 01:07:52,761
[SPEAKER_65]: Despite my note about updating the language of this resolution, I also want to put forth a disclaimer that I don't believe I personally have the ability or maybe it's simply not possible to talk about this issue in a way that does not leave one group or another at risk of feeling diminished or blamed or impoverished.

788
01:07:55,506 --> 01:08:06,373
[SPEAKER_65]: If you are feeling that way, please blame me or blame the insufficiency of language to talk about an issue that is breaking all of our hearts and has been breaking all of our hearts for decades, and most especially many people in this room.

789
01:08:06,413 --> 01:08:07,194
[SPEAKER_65]: And thank you for being here.

790
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:18,326
[SPEAKER_65]: I want to speak briefly to why I elected to bring this resolution forward, apart from the fact that I was contacted by constituents to do so, that being the ultimate reason.

791
01:08:20,527 --> 01:08:21,008
[SPEAKER_65]: I am Jewish.

792
01:08:21,648 --> 01:08:27,052
[SPEAKER_65]: My ancestors on both sides came to America in the early 1900s because Eastern Europe wasn't safe for them.

793
01:08:27,772 --> 01:08:31,975
[SPEAKER_65]: My last name is Collins because my great-grandfather couldn't get a job with a Jewish last name.

794
01:08:32,956 --> 01:08:35,858
[SPEAKER_65]: My family knows that anti-Semitism is real and it is dangerous.

795
01:08:38,976 --> 01:08:58,815
[SPEAKER_65]: I believe that past hardship and trauma and persecution are never valid nor meaningful, but we can seek to make past trauma and hardship, we can seek to get something out of that if we put that experience in service of other people and stand in solidarity with other people who are also facing oppression and persecution.

796
01:09:01,232 --> 01:09:10,058
[SPEAKER_65]: Now we see a right-wing government using the grief of Jewish people, like me, and the name of Jewish people to justify the destruction of an entire civilian population in Gaza.

797
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:14,301
[SPEAKER_65]: There are no words that can adequately capture this horror, pain, and injustice.

798
01:09:15,141 --> 01:09:17,363
[SPEAKER_65]: This resolution is long, but the ask is simple.

799
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:21,706
[SPEAKER_65]: Our US government is deeply entwined with and invested in the Israeli military.

800
01:09:22,006 --> 01:09:27,669
[SPEAKER_65]: Our federal leaders have the influence, the power, and the purse strings to hasten an end to the killing.

801
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:32,813
[SPEAKER_65]: This issue is painful and divisive, more for some than for others.

802
01:09:33,974 --> 01:09:38,216
[SPEAKER_65]: But ultimately, this resolution is about safety, and I believe that should unify us.

803
01:09:39,117 --> 01:09:44,961
[SPEAKER_65]: Marginalizing Palestinians, whether legally, physically, or in the media, advances no one's safety.

804
01:09:45,701 --> 01:09:55,488
[SPEAKER_65]: It's simply not right, and I would defy anyone to tell me that the mass murder, displacement, and destruction in Gaza will leave Israeli residents more safe from violent extremism.

805
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:00,635
[SPEAKER_65]: Some people would question the validity of city-level resolutions about this issue.

806
01:10:01,295 --> 01:10:05,080
[SPEAKER_65]: To me, this is a Medford issue because Medford residents are invested in the issue.

807
01:10:06,262 --> 01:10:07,083
[SPEAKER_65]: And while the U.S.

808
01:10:07,323 --> 01:10:12,911
[SPEAKER_65]: government condones the killing and sends unrestricted military aid to Israel, communities right here in the U.S.

809
01:10:12,971 --> 01:10:13,952
[SPEAKER_65]: are starved for funding.

810
01:10:14,933 --> 01:10:27,296
[SPEAKER_65]: If you attend any average city council meeting, what you'll hear us talk about ultimately is how there aren't enough public dollars to pay for resident services, fully funded schools, affordable housing, road safety, and on and on.

811
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:32,177
[SPEAKER_65]: Meanwhile, our federal leaders authorized billions to help bomb kids in Gaza.

812
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:33,758
[SPEAKER_65]: I find that

813
01:10:43,174 --> 01:10:47,664
[SPEAKER_65]: I find it unfathomable on a human level, and I find it infuriating as a counselor.

814
01:10:48,686 --> 01:10:52,194
[SPEAKER_65]: Those dollars should be promoting wellness at home, not destruction abroad.

815
01:10:53,419 --> 01:11:02,905
[SPEAKER_65]: I hope that we can find unity in the unacceptability of this oppression and this loss of life, and in demanding an immediate and lasting de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza.

816
01:11:03,565 --> 01:11:12,270
[SPEAKER_65]: I hope that we as a council can join the groundswell of city councils, amplifying their residents' calls for ceasefire, and add Medford's voice to the chorus for peace.

817
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:18,493
[SPEAKER_65]: I hope we can find unity in diminishing no one's suffering and trauma, and in demanding safety and peace for all.

818
01:11:18,894 --> 01:11:19,134
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you.

819
01:11:45,728 --> 01:11:47,429
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

820
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,210
[SPEAKER_37]: Councillor Callaghan.

821
01:11:50,791 --> 01:12:05,020
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I work for a 501C3 organization that takes a position on a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza, among other things, I have filed a disclosure form with the city clerk, but I have been advised by the State Ethics Commission that I am able to vote on this issue.

822
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:07,722
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councillor Callaghan.

823
01:12:10,904 --> 01:12:13,325
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

824
01:12:13,385 --> 01:12:14,166
[SPEAKER_37]: Councillor Lemming.

825
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:24,902
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd just like to say that many members of this community, people I consider to be very close friends have encouraged me to vote in favor of this resolution.

826
01:12:25,062 --> 01:12:25,763
[SPEAKER_30]: What I will say is that

827
01:12:36,093 --> 01:12:37,875
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm an officer in the U.S.

828
01:12:37,915 --> 01:12:38,576
[SPEAKER_30]: military.

829
01:12:38,596 --> 01:12:47,826
[SPEAKER_30]: The Hatch Act does technically allow reservists to comment on these sorts of matters when not on active duty.

830
01:12:47,846 --> 01:12:56,015
[SPEAKER_30]: It is my belief, however, that even though I do commend my colleague for writing a

831
01:12:56,909 --> 01:13:08,477
[SPEAKER_30]: very thorough and very well said resolution that voting on this resolution would adversely impact my ability to do my job.

832
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:15,762
[SPEAKER_30]: So I just want to put that out there, and I will be abstaining from this.

833
01:13:18,444 --> 01:13:19,205
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

834
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:21,381
[SPEAKER_32]: Councilor Scarpelli.

835
01:13:21,862 --> 01:13:25,466
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Councilor Villescaz and thank you, Vice President Collins.

836
01:13:25,506 --> 01:13:28,309
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that I'm going to

837
01:13:29,465 --> 01:13:44,357
[SPEAKER_32]: bring us back to a few sessions ago, and I made a commitment that for one councilor, I would stand with the policy that I will not vote on any national or international vote that comes to this council.

838
01:13:44,937 --> 01:13:55,505
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we have so many issues right now within our community that I think our focus really needs to be on the measures of Medford right now.

839
01:13:55,946 --> 01:13:57,387
[SPEAKER_32]: I know that, you know,

840
01:13:59,088 --> 01:14:09,680
[SPEAKER_32]: the information will go out there that Councilor Scott Peli doesn't believe in this, or Councilor Scott Peli's belief is X or Y. The truth of the matter is, everybody is in favor of peace.

841
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:13,044
[SPEAKER_32]: And I've had the opportunity to talk to so many

842
01:14:13,965 --> 01:14:30,919
[SPEAKER_32]: great residents of method both from Palestine that are in support of this resolution, that are from that are Jewish that are supporting this resolution, and a Jewish residents that are totally against this resolution.

843
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:41,788
[SPEAKER_32]: So I found that this one resolution gave me the opportunity to listen to some amazing people that she had some amazing thoughts.

844
01:14:42,709 --> 01:15:06,941
[SPEAKER_32]: And what I find it more important is that we have an avenue to bring some very, very educated people that have their own thought process to come together and unite them, and then come back with a message that I will personally work with, that we can contact the people that have contacted me, bring my friends together, and then send a message together.

845
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:10,043
[SPEAKER_32]: Because one thing that I've realized and something Medford doesn't need,

846
01:15:11,189 --> 01:15:13,051
[SPEAKER_32]: This is another piece dividing our community.

847
01:15:13,651 --> 01:15:20,478
[SPEAKER_32]: So no matter what anybody votes or how they vote tonight, there's going to be a half that's really separated.

848
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:28,725
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's not from my opinion, my own opinion, my beliefs, but this is my opinion from the multiple phone calls I got.

849
01:15:29,486 --> 01:15:47,272
[SPEAKER_32]: I did receive messages from people that asked me that if they could, if I could read something into the record or a statement to the record, and I on both sides, I, I recommend a recommended my Palestinian friends to send any messages they wanted me to read on the record.

850
01:15:47,712 --> 01:15:55,675
[SPEAKER_32]: I've asked my friends on who feel that this isn't a resolution that they feel safe on that I would share the information show.

851
01:15:55,735 --> 01:15:58,216
[SPEAKER_32]: So if, if you would allow me I have

852
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,883
[SPEAKER_37]: I have, if you wouldn't mind, I just have some as well.

853
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:05,511
[SPEAKER_37]: Could we let councilor speak and then can we come back to the reading into the record piece?

854
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:06,032
[SPEAKER_37]: Is that okay?

855
01:16:08,476 --> 01:16:14,920
[SPEAKER_37]: It's uncharacteristic, Councilor Baez, that usually we... I'd just like to treat all public participation the same, if that's all right.

856
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,441
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a public participation.

857
01:16:16,481 --> 01:16:21,064
[SPEAKER_32]: This is the council speaking as part of the record.

858
01:16:21,164 --> 01:16:22,825
[SPEAKER_37]: Are you reading other people's statements in the record?

859
01:16:22,845 --> 01:16:22,945
[SPEAKER_32]: I am.

860
01:16:22,965 --> 01:16:23,526
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, I am.

861
01:16:23,686 --> 01:16:23,866
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

862
01:16:23,886 --> 01:16:25,747
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you'd like to do that, I'll... If that's all right.

863
01:16:25,767 --> 01:16:26,848
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll yield to you and then come back.

864
01:16:27,048 --> 01:16:28,569
[SPEAKER_37]: I have some from others.

865
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:34,913
[SPEAKER_37]: If I could just go to... Let every councilor say their piece, then I'll go right back to you after councilors have spoken to read other statements into the record.

866
01:16:35,193 --> 01:16:36,094
[SPEAKER_37]: You'll be first in line.

867
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:37,870
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor say.

868
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:39,391
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, President bears.

869
01:16:40,052 --> 01:16:54,425
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, my focus as a city councilor in this job as a candidate who ran for city council who first ran for city council, um, just over two years ago, um, who started the campaign almost three years ago.

870
01:16:54,445 --> 01:16:54,506
[SPEAKER_28]: The

871
01:16:56,581 --> 01:17:11,568
[SPEAKER_28]: biggest issue going up at going in my brain at that time was fighting to make sure that our residents that all of our residents felt safe and not only just safe, but welcome and included and engaged in our city government.

872
01:17:11,588 --> 01:17:13,528
[SPEAKER_28]: I grew up, obviously, my

873
01:17:15,749 --> 01:17:17,650
[SPEAKER_28]: My skin color makes me look different from other people.

874
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:28,175
[SPEAKER_28]: I grew up oftentimes as someone who felt excluded, as someone who didn't necessarily feel completely represented in government.

875
01:17:28,776 --> 01:17:37,540
[SPEAKER_28]: And for me, that was a driving factor to get involved in government and to make sure that we built a local government that reflected the desires of its people, that the

876
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:44,942
[SPEAKER_28]: push for equity and for justice, and to make sure that that push was reflected in our actions as well.

877
01:17:46,123 --> 01:17:51,804
[SPEAKER_28]: And at the end of the day, to make sure that all of our residents feel safe and welcome here in our city.

878
01:17:53,125 --> 01:18:06,109
[SPEAKER_28]: It's with that spirit that after the horrifying attacks on October 7th, I reached out to Jewish, Arab, and Muslim community leaders to make sure that, at least from my office, that they

879
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:27,087
[SPEAKER_28]: felt safe, that they felt welcomed and included, and knowing that there were growing incidents of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic and xenophobic attacks and incidents in this community to make sure that they have the resources they need and needed and still need to feel safe and welcome in our city.

880
01:18:27,968 --> 01:18:47,895
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, as situations on the ground, um, have developed, uh, more residents of various backgrounds, including a large number of, uh, Jewish, personally very close Jewish friends begged me as a city councilor to vote yes, um, when a ceasefire resolution, if a ceasefire resolution came across my desk.

881
01:18:48,535 --> 01:18:56,918
[SPEAKER_28]: And through those discussions, I realized that not voting, not doing anything is, um, an action in itself.

882
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:20,234
[SPEAKER_28]: And so, and for so many of our residents, they need to see that their elected officials align with the values that we espouse as candidates and that we espouse as politicians.

883
01:19:21,295 --> 01:19:24,497
[SPEAKER_28]: When I look at this resolution, I look at the first and last lines.

884
01:19:26,877 --> 01:19:32,403
[SPEAKER_28]: recognizing and celebrating the sanctity, the preciousness, the equality of human life.

885
01:19:34,325 --> 01:19:45,456
[SPEAKER_28]: Looking at the last line cites the core purpose of this resolution as to reaffirm that we stand with protecting and honoring all human life.

886
01:19:47,588 --> 01:19:58,862
[SPEAKER_28]: This is undoubtedly a difficult situation, but I really do commend Councillor Collins for keeping the focus in this resolution on the sanctity of life.

887
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:12,125
[SPEAKER_28]: for keeping the focus of this resolution through hope on equality, bringing in stakeholders from many, many different parts of this community, hearing opposition to different drafts of this resolution.

888
01:20:12,165 --> 01:20:20,468
[SPEAKER_28]: I know the vice president has worked really, really hard on a product that best captures that inclusive energy and spirit that we want to see in our city.

889
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:28,725
[SPEAKER_28]: For me, again, the local aspect of this is that, is just that.

890
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:33,509
[SPEAKER_28]: It is the quality of letting our residents know that we stand with these values.

891
01:20:35,842 --> 01:20:39,545
[SPEAKER_28]: when I also think about why this resolution is necessary.

892
01:20:41,187 --> 01:20:53,076
[SPEAKER_28]: I realize that, you know, while this isn't necessarily, you know, obviously, I don't think anyone is under the illusion that we ourselves as Medford City Council is going to stop war in the Middle East, but

893
01:20:54,358 --> 01:21:10,854
[SPEAKER_28]: I do think that many, many folks, many residents, neighbors, activists have felt disillusioned, disheartened, and in despair after various and numerous attempts to reach out to federal and state level stakeholders on this issue, people with influence.

894
01:21:11,474 --> 01:21:19,182
[SPEAKER_28]: And they're coming to the Medford City Council, they're coming to City Hall tonight, because they recognize that there aren't many avenues left.

895
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:31,391
[SPEAKER_28]: We are, in many ways, one of the last stops that people are going to, to ask us, to beg us to help them get their message across to our federal electeds.

896
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:43,914
[SPEAKER_28]: I think we really need to try, in any case, be it Gaza, be it a local issue about a park or a street or a sidewalk.

897
01:21:44,354 --> 01:21:53,200
[SPEAKER_28]: We as elected officials, as the Medford City Council, have a responsibility to amplify the community's desires to speak to federal elected officials.

898
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,261
[SPEAKER_28]: That's our job.

899
01:21:54,621 --> 01:21:55,982
[SPEAKER_28]: We do it on different issues.

900
01:21:56,322 --> 01:21:57,663
[SPEAKER_28]: We reach out to Congress people.

901
01:21:57,703 --> 01:22:01,145
[SPEAKER_28]: We reach out to state reps to help us resolve things.

902
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:02,286
[SPEAKER_28]: This is our job.

903
01:22:04,907 --> 01:22:15,170
[SPEAKER_28]: I, you know, I think there's a crisis of faith in democracy when people don't feel hurt by their elected officials, and I think we need to work to restore that faith in our country.

904
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:25,712
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

905
01:22:26,332 --> 01:22:28,773
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further comments by members of the Council?

906
01:22:31,724 --> 01:22:38,949
[SPEAKER_37]: Seeing none, as the president and the chair, I will not be, I will be voting, but I will not be participating in debate as I move us through this resolution.

907
01:22:38,969 --> 01:22:41,191
[SPEAKER_37]: And I hope everyone can appreciate that that is my role.

908
01:22:42,612 --> 01:22:48,876
[SPEAKER_37]: Now we will go to hear from, if anyone would like to read anything into the record, I know we have Councilor Scarpelli has a number of items.

909
01:22:48,976 --> 01:22:49,537
[SPEAKER_37]: I have an item.

910
01:22:49,557 --> 01:22:52,679
[SPEAKER_37]: Are there any other councilors would like to read any statements into the record that they received?

911
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,221
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Scarpelli, and I appreciate your deference to me.

912
01:22:57,341 --> 01:22:59,182
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I completely understand.

913
01:22:59,222 --> 01:23:03,265
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a topic that I respect from all my fellow councilors.

914
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:07,948
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that anything that you've said, I don't think any of us disagree.

915
01:23:08,468 --> 01:23:10,189
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's very important that everybody understand this.

916
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:18,915
[SPEAKER_32]: We have a council that is very cordial and respectful, and this isn't an easy and a simple issue that has a simple outcome.

917
01:23:19,676 --> 01:23:22,758
[SPEAKER_32]: But I will tell you, as Councilor Sagan mentioned,

918
01:23:24,939 --> 01:23:36,092
[SPEAKER_32]: the communication I received from our constituents that felt the need that were scared to come out tonight, that really wanted to understand that

919
01:23:38,123 --> 01:23:41,764
[SPEAKER_32]: what is being said so far, they're feeling the opposite.

920
01:23:41,804 --> 01:23:51,627
[SPEAKER_32]: They feel that with this motion moving forward, that it hurts what we have in our community of bringing people together.

921
01:23:51,787 --> 01:23:59,669
[SPEAKER_32]: So again, not my view, I'm explaining what residents have reached out to me and asked that I share.

922
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:02,610
[SPEAKER_32]: One person that I respect,

923
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:11,653
[SPEAKER_32]: A former teacher of mine, who has been living in Israel for many, many years now, reached out with a comment.

924
01:24:11,753 --> 01:24:20,935
[SPEAKER_32]: He said, while nobody here wants to see any more death, people must remember that on October 6, there was a ceasefire agreement in effect that was holding well.

925
01:24:21,355 --> 01:24:25,817
[SPEAKER_32]: However, on October 7, Hamas terrorists violated the ceasefire and attacked

926
01:24:26,417 --> 01:24:38,208
[SPEAKER_32]: kibbutzim, villages, and a music festival murdering 1,200 Israeli, including not only Jews, but Muslims, Christians, Jews, Americans, Thais, Russians, British, among others.

927
01:24:39,049 --> 01:24:47,156
[SPEAKER_32]: While mutilating many bodies, burning some alive in ovens, and raping countless women, there were people ranging in ages eight to 87 years old.

928
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:55,992
[SPEAKER_32]: There was among over 230 kidnapped people that were brought back to Gaza, of which 136 are still being held.

929
01:24:56,532 --> 01:24:58,434
[SPEAKER_32]: If they are alive, we still have questions.

930
01:24:59,074 --> 01:25:05,959
[SPEAKER_32]: Since Hamas has not allowed the IRC to visit the hostages, we have no idea how any of them are doing.

931
01:25:06,099 --> 01:25:14,486
[SPEAKER_32]: A ceasefire resolution only gives confidence to Hamas that they are winning the war in the West and makes it harder to get the hostages, the bodies, back.

932
01:25:14,986 --> 01:25:26,470
[SPEAKER_32]: Plus, Israel will not accept a ceasefire unless includes a return of all hostages and bodies as well as leadership of Hamas being sent into exile to a country that will accept them.

933
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:32,073
[SPEAKER_32]: Unless those conditions happen, it doesn't matter how many cities or states or countries vote for a ceasefire.

934
01:25:32,493 --> 01:25:33,573
[SPEAKER_32]: Israel will not accept it.

935
01:25:33,653 --> 01:25:39,816
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think that whether you believe in it or not, these are messages that come from families of Medford.

936
01:25:40,876 --> 01:25:42,577
[SPEAKER_32]: We have another that was sent

937
01:25:43,257 --> 01:25:45,198
[SPEAKER_32]: that wanted to reach out in the statement.

938
01:25:46,418 --> 01:25:52,380
[SPEAKER_32]: Forgive me that they're longer, but to members of the council and those in attendance, thank you for listening to this statement.

939
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:58,921
[SPEAKER_32]: The months since 10-7 have been extremely tight trying for the Jewish community.

940
01:25:58,981 --> 01:26:04,063
[SPEAKER_32]: We experienced a predominantly attack on the brothers and sisters solely because they are Jewish.

941
01:26:05,413 --> 01:26:11,058
[SPEAKER_32]: It brings back haunting memories of when this was commonplace not more than a century ago.

942
01:26:11,538 --> 01:26:16,342
[SPEAKER_32]: We are slaughtered not for the military advantage, not for political maneuvering, but because we're Jewish.

943
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:21,726
[SPEAKER_32]: The only thing different today is that there is a country and an army that will push back and defend us.

944
01:26:22,247 --> 01:26:24,649
[SPEAKER_32]: In the World War Two during the programs in Russia,

945
01:26:25,089 --> 01:26:34,495
[SPEAKER_32]: and the inquisitions across Liberia and in ups or uprisings like Farhoud in Middle East, we were defenseless.

946
01:26:34,915 --> 01:26:42,821
[SPEAKER_32]: But today in the first time in 2000 years, we have the ability to stand up and push back against the Jew haters that are attempting to alienate us.

947
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:59,153
[SPEAKER_32]: In the latest, we have experienced rapidly rising anti-Semitism, including here at home, with genocide chants down the street at Harvard, and anti-Zionists who, by definition, call the destruction of the Jewish homeland in Israel.

948
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:08,240
[SPEAKER_32]: We hear louder and louder every day the warning signals that Jews are no longer safe, coupled with the thousands upon thousands who celebrated our deaths on 10-7.

949
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:08,720
[SPEAKER_32]: We are scared.

950
01:27:10,862 --> 01:27:20,509
[SPEAKER_32]: We cannot trust our local officials to stand against anti-Semitism, and we cannot trust our fellow citizens when we see them marching in the streets calling for more Jewish deaths.

951
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:22,230
[SPEAKER_32]: Our concerns are not heard.

952
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,171
[SPEAKER_32]: Our safety is ignored.

953
01:27:24,711 --> 01:27:33,077
[SPEAKER_32]: And this ceasefire resolution before you is a symbol that you are telling Jews to once again not push back, not fight for the survival, but lay down and take it.

954
01:27:33,517 --> 01:27:40,162
[SPEAKER_32]: That is what we hear when there are calls for Israel to call off the war against those who started this in the Battle of 10-7.

955
01:27:41,442 --> 01:27:50,465
[SPEAKER_32]: During World War II, we did not have a ceasefire for Nazis or Imperial Japan, despite the horrific amount of civilian death in the war and aggression the Axis started.

956
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:57,508
[SPEAKER_32]: There was no ceasefire against Al Qaeda 9-11, and the worldwide Jewish community will not abide the ceasefire with the Hamas.

957
01:27:57,988 --> 01:28:00,569
[SPEAKER_32]: The common thread here is that there cannot be a ceasefire

958
01:28:01,229 --> 01:28:06,390
[SPEAKER_32]: with groups whose entire reason for existence is ideological mass murder.

959
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:13,992
[SPEAKER_32]: The only type of viable, long-term, and durable ceasefire is one where Hamas' war-making ability is destroyed.

960
01:28:14,612 --> 01:28:20,913
[SPEAKER_32]: Only then can Israeli lives and security of the Palestinians can be free from an Islamic dictatorship.

961
01:28:21,393 --> 01:28:24,474
[SPEAKER_32]: A ceasefire that leaves Hamas in place is a banned

962
01:28:25,194 --> 01:28:26,434
[SPEAKER_32]: band-aid upon a cancer.

963
01:28:27,195 --> 01:28:33,236
[SPEAKER_32]: It may save some lives in the short term, but guarantees more war, death, and destruction down the road.

964
01:28:33,616 --> 01:28:40,238
[SPEAKER_32]: Hamas officials have promised to repeat the genocide of 10-7 again and again.

965
01:28:40,498 --> 01:28:43,019
[SPEAKER_32]: Israel will be forced to continue to defend their citizens.

966
01:28:43,419 --> 01:28:48,600
[SPEAKER_32]: Hamas will continue to try to kill Jews and hide behind their own Gaza subjects.

967
01:28:49,101 --> 01:28:53,742
[SPEAKER_32]: Jews, Arabs, Israelis, Palestinians, all will suffer until Hamas is no longer

968
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:55,303
[SPEAKER_32]: poses a threat.

969
01:28:55,703 --> 01:29:04,770
[SPEAKER_32]: And even after this, there is those who are still not swayed by the existential fear of Jewish constituents face.

970
01:29:05,351 --> 01:29:06,212
[SPEAKER_32]: I leave you with this.

971
01:29:06,472 --> 01:29:08,553
[SPEAKER_32]: Why is the council taking such a stand?

972
01:29:09,134 --> 01:29:09,814
[SPEAKER_32]: What is it about

973
01:29:10,495 --> 01:29:25,278
[SPEAKER_32]: this war that is exceptionally different from all the other conflicts raging in the world, that makes it worth splitting a community further alienated, an already fearful minority, just to issue a statement about a handful of these beliefs.

974
01:29:25,859 --> 01:29:28,141
[SPEAKER_32]: How does this serve the interests of Medford residents?

975
01:29:28,581 --> 01:29:33,124
[SPEAKER_32]: And what message do you think will be heard for your actions today?

976
01:29:33,384 --> 01:29:37,386
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for listening to these concerns.

977
01:29:37,887 --> 01:29:51,816
[SPEAKER_32]: So I will tell you, I've shared some amazing conversations from my Palestinian friends that it was a great understanding, something that I will never understand the,

978
01:29:53,797 --> 01:29:55,078
[SPEAKER_32]: the feelings that you have.

979
01:29:55,158 --> 01:30:02,105
[SPEAKER_32]: I could never, no one here, unless you're Palestinian or Jewish in Israel and understand the situation we're going through.

980
01:30:02,546 --> 01:30:07,350
[SPEAKER_32]: So to minimize that, to minimize that, to minimize that would be disrespectful.

981
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:08,852
[SPEAKER_32]: But I will tell you that there is

982
01:30:16,599 --> 01:30:37,077
[SPEAKER_32]: a ground movement moving forward that I will gladly move forward with, with my friends that I've now worked with, that bringing our Palestinian people and our Jewish residents to find a clear message that we can work together, that could present to this community, that it's more of a unified front.

983
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:40,960
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that that's what's important here in Medford today.

984
01:30:41,661 --> 01:30:48,027
[SPEAKER_32]: So again, whether it's popular or not, that's not my intent here.

985
01:30:48,227 --> 01:30:58,996
[SPEAKER_32]: I have a strong belief in what I believe in when it comes to issues dealing with national, international issues.

986
01:30:59,496 --> 01:31:01,378
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm gonna abstain from any votes.

987
01:31:01,478 --> 01:31:05,702
[SPEAKER_32]: I will not vote for anything on any agenda that comes forth in this council.

988
01:31:05,722 --> 01:31:08,104
[SPEAKER_32]: I've done this in the past, and I'll do this moving forward.

989
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,422
[SPEAKER_32]: That doesn't mean George Scott Pelley doesn't believe in peace.

990
01:31:12,923 --> 01:31:20,729
[SPEAKER_32]: That doesn't mean that George Scott Pelley doesn't believe that there isn't a way to unify our community.

991
01:31:21,489 --> 01:31:30,436
[SPEAKER_32]: But this is who I am, who my residents have requested their information be spread.

992
01:31:31,017 --> 01:31:34,600
[SPEAKER_32]: And I thank you for the time, Mr. President.

993
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,261
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

994
01:31:36,321 --> 01:31:47,549
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to read a statement that we received a call here at City Hall from a resident who has to make a statement in support of 24035 resolution in support of a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza.

995
01:31:48,009 --> 01:31:54,474
[SPEAKER_37]: The caller is a Medford resident of over 15 years, married to an Arab American and mother of two children are also of Arab heritage.

996
01:31:55,034 --> 01:31:59,357
[SPEAKER_37]: She supports the resolution filed by Vice President Collins for a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza.

997
01:31:59,737 --> 01:32:03,320
[SPEAKER_37]: She has friends directly impacted who have lost dozens and dozens of family members

998
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:08,624
[SPEAKER_37]: a ceasefire is what's best for all people and would prevent wider escalation of wars and suffering in the region.

999
01:32:09,044 --> 01:32:11,927
[SPEAKER_37]: The caller asked to remain anonymous for the safety of her family.

1000
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:17,031
[SPEAKER_37]: So we've heard a number of opinions tonight.

1001
01:32:17,571 --> 01:32:20,153
[SPEAKER_37]: We are going to hear opinions that we disagree with tonight.

1002
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:23,356
[SPEAKER_37]: Votes are going to be taken that we may disagree with tonight.

1003
01:32:24,037 --> 01:32:26,378
[SPEAKER_37]: I deeply ask everyone to respect

1004
01:32:27,452 --> 01:32:32,178
[SPEAKER_37]: the rules of the council, my role as chair, and we're gonna try to hear from everyone.

1005
01:32:32,218 --> 01:32:33,840
[SPEAKER_37]: We're gonna go, there's no end point.

1006
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:35,682
[SPEAKER_37]: I've been here till 2.30 in the morning before.

1007
01:32:36,443 --> 01:32:39,587
[SPEAKER_37]: Maybe we'll be here tonight if everyone in this room wants to speak for two minutes.

1008
01:32:40,408 --> 01:32:44,113
[SPEAKER_37]: But when we speak, we're going to listen for two minutes.

1009
01:32:44,253 --> 01:32:45,795
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to give a 30 second warning.

1010
01:32:46,877 --> 01:32:52,383
[SPEAKER_37]: And I really please ask folks not to interrupt or try to disrupt the speech of anyone.

1011
01:32:52,423 --> 01:32:54,765
[SPEAKER_37]: Again, we are going to hear things that we disagree with tonight.

1012
01:32:55,305 --> 01:32:57,608
[SPEAKER_37]: I stand here very often and hear things I disagree with.

1013
01:32:58,188 --> 01:33:01,472
[SPEAKER_37]: And I do try my very, very best not to react.

1014
01:33:02,352 --> 01:33:06,477
[SPEAKER_37]: And I ask just that we hold that level of respect for everyone as they speak tonight.

1015
01:33:07,622 --> 01:33:08,663
[SPEAKER_37]: We'll hear from everyone.

1016
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:14,527
[SPEAKER_37]: A vote on some motion will be taken on this resolution, and that will be how this process goes.

1017
01:33:15,247 --> 01:33:20,391
[SPEAKER_37]: So as I said, we can have folks line up here at the podium if they would like to speak.

1018
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:22,752
[SPEAKER_37]: We will alternate also with Zoom.

1019
01:33:22,812 --> 01:33:30,317
[SPEAKER_37]: If people are on Zoom, please raise your hand on Zoom, and we will go back and forth between the podium and Zoom as hands are raised.

1020
01:33:31,278 --> 01:33:32,519
[SPEAKER_37]: Everyone will have two minutes.

1021
01:33:33,159 --> 01:33:37,222
[SPEAKER_37]: I will begin a timer after I ask folks to introduce themselves.

1022
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:43,967
[SPEAKER_37]: If you would like to just provide the city that you live in versus your street address, you may do so.

1023
01:33:44,648 --> 01:33:49,913
[SPEAKER_37]: But I will ask for name and city of residence and address if you are comfortable sharing your address.

1024
01:33:50,593 --> 01:33:52,094
[SPEAKER_37]: It looks like we're gonna have a lot of comments.

1025
01:33:52,114 --> 01:34:01,422
[SPEAKER_37]: So again, as I did before, and as you all saw the role of this chair, I'm going to ask you to stop at two minutes and I really please ask that you respect that.

1026
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:04,085
[SPEAKER_37]: We cool with that?

1027
01:34:05,663 --> 01:34:06,864
[SPEAKER_37]: All right, thank you very much.

1028
01:34:07,144 --> 01:34:09,066
[SPEAKER_37]: And we're gonna start at the podium.

1029
01:34:09,526 --> 01:34:10,928
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

1030
01:34:10,968 --> 01:34:12,009
[SPEAKER_37]: We'll make sure we can hear you.

1031
01:34:12,389 --> 01:34:15,352
[SPEAKER_37]: And you will have two minutes once you've said your name.

1032
01:34:16,152 --> 01:34:17,233
[SPEAKER_17]: Muneer Germanis.

1033
01:34:17,914 --> 01:34:19,916
[SPEAKER_17]: I live at 3 Summit Road in Medford.

1034
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:20,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Muneer.

1035
01:34:21,457 --> 01:34:26,341
[SPEAKER_17]: I was born in Jerusalem, Palestine, prior to the creation of the State of Israel.

1036
01:34:27,341 --> 01:34:39,208
[SPEAKER_17]: and I'm a survivor of the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948, which has been ongoing for the past 75 years and has drastically increased in the past few months.

1037
01:34:40,168 --> 01:34:49,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently, when my ancestors became Christians, we lost our rights to our house and land according to Israeli law.

1038
01:34:50,074 --> 01:34:59,065
[SPEAKER_17]: By training, I'm a physicist with a PhD in physics from Tufts University, and I'm a naturalized citizen that has called Medford home for the past 40 years.

1039
01:34:59,846 --> 01:35:09,497
[SPEAKER_17]: I was ordained as an elder at the Presbyterian Church, Clarendon Hill in Somerville, and I served on its ruling session for approximately 30 years.

1040
01:35:10,598 --> 01:35:16,262
[SPEAKER_17]: I was also a member of the Medford Human Rights Commission and served as chair for a few years.

1041
01:35:16,883 --> 01:35:23,607
[SPEAKER_17]: I am currently a member of Mass Peace Action, Jewish Voice for Peace, as well as Safe Medford and Medford People Power.

1042
01:35:24,168 --> 01:35:31,093
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm here tonight to urge each and every member of this council to support this resolution

1043
01:35:31,633 --> 01:35:43,261
[SPEAKER_17]: which is aimed at ending the nightmare in Gaza and Israel with a huge number of bombs, missiles, and drone attacks that our government is funding from our tax dollars.

1044
01:35:43,962 --> 01:35:49,706
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a human rights issue that concerns all of us in this room, in this city, and in this country.

1045
01:35:50,226 --> 01:36:01,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Two months ago, I contacted our human rights commission to discuss issuing a statement about this conflict and its effect on our community, similar to what other human rights commissions in neighboring cities have done.

1046
01:36:02,292 --> 01:36:07,194
[SPEAKER_17]: But the commission was not allowed to even discuss this without permission from the city solicitor.

1047
01:36:07,975 --> 01:36:14,586
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm grateful that this Council is not restricted in this manner and thankful for the opportunity to discuss this in a public forum.

1048
01:36:14,927 --> 01:36:20,356
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks again for allowing me to speak tonight and once more I urge and implore you to vote for this resolution.

1049
01:36:20,496 --> 01:36:20,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1050
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:34,751
[SPEAKER_37]: We have some hands raised on Zoom.

1051
01:36:34,871 --> 01:36:36,451
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to go to Steve Schnapp.

1052
01:36:37,171 --> 01:36:44,794
[SPEAKER_37]: Steve, I'm going to unmute you, ask you for your name, and you can provide your address or your city, and then I will give you a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.

1053
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:48,635
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Steve Schnapp.

1054
01:36:48,735 --> 01:36:50,896
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 36 Hillside Ave.

1055
01:36:50,996 --> 01:36:51,836
[SPEAKER_12]: in Medford Square.

1056
01:36:53,276 --> 01:37:01,679
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to address the relevance of this resolution to me as a Medford resident and the concern that Councilor Scarpelli and others have raised about that.

1057
01:37:03,228 --> 01:37:07,369
[SPEAKER_12]: I was born in February 1946, just after World War II ended.

1058
01:37:08,569 --> 01:37:17,390
[SPEAKER_12]: I had two uncles in the military, one of whom fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and he was in the advanced forces that liberated several concentration camps.

1059
01:37:18,271 --> 01:37:21,691
[SPEAKER_12]: He was featured in Steven Spielberg's documentary of the Holocaust.

1060
01:37:23,872 --> 01:37:26,292
[SPEAKER_12]: The Holocaust was very present in my family.

1061
01:37:27,132 --> 01:37:31,333
[SPEAKER_12]: My mother gave me the Hebrew name Shalom, which means peace.

1062
01:37:32,409 --> 01:37:40,613
[SPEAKER_12]: And she did that because she wanted to recognize that this atrocity should never happen again.

1063
01:37:44,615 --> 01:37:49,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to read a quote that addresses the relevance of this resolution.

1064
01:37:51,440 --> 01:38:06,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.

1065
01:38:07,182 --> 01:38:10,745
[SPEAKER_12]: The world in arms is not spending money alone.

1066
01:38:10,905 --> 01:38:20,593
[SPEAKER_12]: It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children, and the hopes of its children.

1067
01:38:21,073 --> 01:38:28,839
[SPEAKER_12]: The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this, a modern school in more than 30 cities.

1068
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:35,124
[SPEAKER_12]: It's two electric power plants, each serving towns of 60,000 population.

1069
01:38:37,509 --> 01:38:39,889
[SPEAKER_12]: It is to find fully equipped hospitals.

1070
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:43,370
[SPEAKER_12]: It is some 50 miles of concrete pavement.

1071
01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:48,371
[SPEAKER_12]: We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat.

1072
01:38:49,051 --> 01:38:54,592
[SPEAKER_12]: We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.

1073
01:38:55,172 --> 01:38:56,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Steve, thank you very much.

1074
01:38:57,033 --> 01:38:58,813
[SPEAKER_12]: That was Dwight David Eisenhower.

1075
01:39:00,493 --> 01:39:01,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Steve.

1076
01:39:02,314 --> 01:39:03,314
[SPEAKER_37]: We're going to go to the podium.

1077
01:39:05,649 --> 01:39:09,852
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, and then I'll give you two minutes.

1078
01:39:10,112 --> 01:39:12,794
[SPEAKER_64]: Naila Germanis, 3 Summit Road, Medford, Manhattan.

1079
01:39:13,234 --> 01:39:14,055
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, you have two minutes.

1080
01:39:14,635 --> 01:39:17,177
[SPEAKER_64]: I have been a resident of Medford for 40 years.

1081
01:39:18,098 --> 01:39:22,260
[SPEAKER_64]: My children went to Medford public schools and graduated from high school there.

1082
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:26,803
[SPEAKER_64]: I was born in Lebanon and came to Tufts University as a graduate student.

1083
01:39:28,024 --> 01:39:28,765
[SPEAKER_64]: I have been a U.S.

1084
01:39:28,805 --> 01:39:30,126
[SPEAKER_64]: citizen for 40 years.

1085
01:39:31,204 --> 01:39:51,748
[SPEAKER_64]: In 1982, I planned to visit my parents with my infant, but was urged not to travel because within four days of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the Israeli army had occupied my village, a Christian village halfway into Lebanon, near Beirut, surrounded by Muslim and Druze villages, where we lived in harmony with our neighbors.

1086
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:54,589
[SPEAKER_64]: The Israelis came to divide and conquer.

1087
01:39:55,649 --> 01:40:02,155
[SPEAKER_64]: Daily, they would bomb the neighboring villages and would tell people in my village to hide, expecting retaliation.

1088
01:40:03,156 --> 01:40:08,160
[SPEAKER_64]: My brothers fled with their families, and we were scattered in different parts of the world.

1089
01:40:08,901 --> 01:40:14,766
[SPEAKER_64]: My uncle stayed with my parents to take care of them, but he died during one of the Israeli bombings.

1090
01:40:15,427 --> 01:40:18,249
[SPEAKER_64]: My parents had to leave home, taking very little with them.

1091
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:21,170
[SPEAKER_64]: Every home in our village was destroyed.

1092
01:40:21,190 --> 01:40:23,791
[SPEAKER_64]: Our home was hit by 18 rockets.

1093
01:40:24,471 --> 01:40:26,632
[SPEAKER_64]: My mother died, never saw her home again.

1094
01:40:27,392 --> 01:40:32,253
[SPEAKER_64]: My mother-in-law died alone in a nursing home, having been displaced twice.

1095
01:40:32,913 --> 01:40:36,233
[SPEAKER_64]: Once in 1948 from her home in Jerusalem, Palestine.

1096
01:40:37,214 --> 01:40:40,974
[SPEAKER_64]: And then, they were brutally forced by the Israelis.

1097
01:40:41,815 --> 01:40:43,095
[SPEAKER_64]: My children... 30 seconds.

1098
01:40:44,136 --> 01:40:47,218
[SPEAKER_64]: My children grew up yearning for family presence in their lives.

1099
01:40:48,219 --> 01:40:53,223
[SPEAKER_64]: Israel destroyed entire neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, and shelters in Gaza.

1100
01:40:54,204 --> 01:40:58,987
[SPEAKER_64]: What happened to us cannot be compared to this horrific assault on Gaza.

1101
01:41:00,589 --> 01:41:05,032
[SPEAKER_64]: My son-in-law's family was seeking shelter in the church in Gaza City.

1102
01:41:05,232 --> 01:41:06,093
[SPEAKER_37]: You have 10 seconds.

1103
01:41:06,193 --> 01:41:10,917
[SPEAKER_64]: The Greek Orthodox Church was bombed and nine members of his family died.

1104
01:41:11,517 --> 01:41:12,278
[SPEAKER_64]: My son-in-law.

1105
01:41:13,777 --> 01:41:17,018
[SPEAKER_64]: Israel is not allowing food, water, or medications into Gaza.

1106
01:41:17,558 --> 01:41:20,819
[SPEAKER_64]: Mothers are malnourished, can't nurse their newborn children.

1107
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:22,440
[SPEAKER_64]: This must stop.

1108
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,740
[SPEAKER_64]: Your vote is very important.

1109
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:25,561
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you very much.

1110
01:41:35,204 --> 01:41:38,545
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to go to Kate Wall on Zoom.

1111
01:41:38,605 --> 01:41:39,485
[SPEAKER_37]: You will have two minutes.

1112
01:41:39,545 --> 01:41:42,746
[SPEAKER_37]: Please provide your name and city or address for the record, please.

1113
01:41:45,771 --> 01:41:46,811
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Kate Wall.

1114
01:41:46,871 --> 01:41:48,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 71 Winchester Street.

1115
01:41:48,812 --> 01:41:50,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be really brief.

1116
01:41:50,853 --> 01:41:55,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say I completely support this resolution and hope that the council will as well.

1117
01:41:55,054 --> 01:41:59,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the stories of these people we've heard so far speak for themselves.

1118
01:41:59,696 --> 01:42:00,056
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

1119
01:42:01,457 --> 01:42:07,499
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you, Kate.

1120
01:42:07,599 --> 01:42:10,960
[SPEAKER_37]: Back to the podium, your name and address or city for the record, please.

1121
01:42:12,116 --> 01:42:13,337
[SPEAKER_63]: My name is Suhad Zinda.

1122
01:42:13,617 --> 01:42:15,619
[SPEAKER_63]: I live on 5 Essex, Medford Street.

1123
01:42:15,939 --> 01:42:18,722
[SPEAKER_63]: I've been a resident of Medford for almost 20 years.

1124
01:42:19,362 --> 01:42:21,444
[SPEAKER_63]: My family lives in Gaza.

1125
01:42:21,464 --> 01:42:24,527
[SPEAKER_63]: I came to Medford from Gaza City.

1126
01:42:26,288 --> 01:42:33,475
[SPEAKER_63]: I came here as an undergrad, I came here as a student, and now I'm an educator on Tufts Medford campus.

1127
01:42:35,862 --> 01:42:43,725
[SPEAKER_63]: I chose Medford to raise my family because of its diverse community and because that's where I felt safe.

1128
01:42:44,405 --> 01:42:53,309
[SPEAKER_63]: It was my first time living in a city, experiencing a city without cement walls, without barbed wires or checkpoints.

1129
01:42:55,856 --> 01:43:08,989
[SPEAKER_63]: I saw trophies here after the Israeli government tightened its siege on Gaza in 2001, which revoked my movement permit to return to Gaza and be with my family ever since.

1130
01:43:11,423 --> 01:43:19,888
[SPEAKER_63]: I was living only an hour and 40 minutes away as an undergrad at Birzeit University in the West Bank when they did that.

1131
01:43:20,588 --> 01:43:27,712
[SPEAKER_63]: It took me four full years in order to bring my family to the United States and reunite with them on a different continent.

1132
01:43:28,673 --> 01:43:38,358
[SPEAKER_63]: It was easier than seeing them and being with my family who live an hour and 40 minutes away from me, only because they were in Gaza, only because of our ethnicity.

1133
01:43:39,959 --> 01:43:40,700
[SPEAKER_37]: You have 30 seconds.

1134
01:43:41,425 --> 01:43:47,410
[SPEAKER_63]: Okay, today, the rest of my family members, my extended family members, remain in Gaza.

1135
01:43:49,472 --> 01:43:52,995
[SPEAKER_63]: 14 of them are still under, are beneath the rubble of their home.

1136
01:43:53,996 --> 01:44:03,165
[SPEAKER_63]: Since October 18th, 127 of my family members, of the Zindah family members, remain missing until today.

1137
01:44:03,525 --> 01:44:06,848
[SPEAKER_63]: The last I heard from them was the 10th of December.

1138
01:44:06,888 --> 01:44:07,849
[SPEAKER_63]: Sorry, I'm out of breath.

1139
01:44:08,349 --> 01:44:09,190
[SPEAKER_37]: 10 seconds of my life.

1140
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:09,831
[SPEAKER_63]: 10 seconds.

1141
01:44:10,331 --> 01:44:19,138
[SPEAKER_63]: I have a cousin last week who had to go through an emergency C-section without any medication and with no sutures afterwards.

1142
01:44:20,139 --> 01:44:24,563
[SPEAKER_63]: And today she's struggling to keep her premature baby safe because there are no incubators.

1143
01:44:25,123 --> 01:44:28,506
[SPEAKER_63]: This carnage must stop now.

1144
01:44:28,886 --> 01:44:30,107
[SPEAKER_63]: Enough is enough.

1145
01:44:30,147 --> 01:44:33,690
[SPEAKER_63]: I implore you to... I implore you.

1146
01:44:35,884 --> 01:44:40,967
[SPEAKER_63]: Please, I implore you to push this forward.

1147
01:44:40,987 --> 01:44:41,667
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you so much.

1148
01:44:41,707 --> 01:44:48,332
[SPEAKER_60]: We're going to go back to Zoom.

1149
01:44:48,992 --> 01:44:51,754
[SPEAKER_37]: We're going to go to Lara Germanis on Zoom.

1150
01:44:52,094 --> 01:44:52,875
[SPEAKER_37]: I will unmute you.

1151
01:44:52,955 --> 01:44:55,377
[SPEAKER_37]: Please provide your name and address for the record.

1152
01:44:55,397 --> 01:44:58,619
[SPEAKER_37]: And then I will give you a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning.

1153
01:45:02,248 --> 01:45:28,982
[SPEAKER_10]: um hello and thank you my name is lara germanis and i am a resident of the city of malden but i grew up in medford i'm a physician um and i am also uh have worked in humanitarian crises um i grew up going to the medford public schools and there i experienced anti-arab racism which was scarring at a magnet school with a diversity curriculum anti-arab racism was so normal that it wasn't even considered racism

1154
01:45:29,932 --> 01:45:35,215
[SPEAKER_10]: My father, whom you heard from tonight, didn't even tell me I was Palestinian, to protect me from that.

1155
01:45:35,235 --> 01:45:50,664
[SPEAKER_10]: It is this deep anti-Arab, anti-Muslim racism that is being blasted by our nation's most powerful publications and politicians, like the New York Times that just printed a piece calling Arabs insects, that is being used to justify genocide in Gaza right now.

1156
01:45:51,224 --> 01:45:55,328
[SPEAKER_10]: killing over 11,500 children and orphaning 19,000.

1157
01:45:55,828 --> 01:46:11,282
[SPEAKER_10]: And we, right now, as American taxpayers, are paying for a second Nakba, like the original Nakba, when the 750,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes and displaced and killed by Zionist militias to create the modern state of Israel in 1948.

1158
01:46:12,603 --> 01:46:14,525
[SPEAKER_10]: This did not start on October 7th.

1159
01:46:15,066 --> 01:46:16,567
[SPEAKER_10]: People were living on land.

1160
01:46:16,727 --> 01:46:17,428
[SPEAKER_10]: They were killed.

1161
01:46:17,508 --> 01:46:19,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Their homes and villages were destroyed.

1162
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:23,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we are watching the same live and much faster on social media.

1163
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:25,736
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are paying for it with our tax dollars.

1164
01:46:26,157 --> 01:46:31,782
[SPEAKER_10]: During the first Nakba, which means catastrophe in Arabic, my father's family fled to Egypt.

1165
01:46:32,203 --> 01:46:33,884
[SPEAKER_10]: They packed up their house in Jerusalem.

1166
01:46:34,645 --> 01:46:49,581
[SPEAKER_10]: yes and we're not allowed to return to my father's house because we are christian this is not a religious issue it's not divisive if you vote against ceasefire you vote for the deaths of the remaining 2.2 palestinians 2.2 million palestinians in gaza

1167
01:46:50,422 --> 01:46:53,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Massachusetts sends over $140 million a year to Israel.

1168
01:46:53,646 --> 01:46:59,573
[SPEAKER_10]: We could use that money to pay for subsidizing 75% of treatment for all Massachusetts lung cancer patients.

1169
01:47:00,014 --> 01:47:03,038
[SPEAKER_10]: We're fully sponsoring assisted living for 2,000 seniors.

1170
01:47:03,518 --> 01:47:08,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead, we're using it to rush bunker buster bombs to Israel, the world's fourth most powerful military.

1171
01:47:09,205 --> 01:47:10,846
[SPEAKER_10]: and we must stop it now.

1172
01:47:11,366 --> 01:47:12,467
[SPEAKER_10]: We are essential.

1173
01:47:12,827 --> 01:47:13,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Our voice is essential.

1174
01:47:14,308 --> 01:47:15,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Clark is our representative.

1175
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:16,769
[SPEAKER_10]: She's close to Biden.

1176
01:47:16,809 --> 01:47:19,791
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a very, very critical message from this city today.

1177
01:47:19,811 --> 01:47:20,831
[SPEAKER_10]: I urge you to vote yes.

1178
01:47:21,072 --> 01:47:21,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1179
01:47:21,492 --> 01:47:31,097
[SPEAKER_37]: We're going to go to the podium.

1180
01:47:31,297 --> 01:47:32,358
[SPEAKER_37]: We're going to go to the podium.

1181
01:47:32,398 --> 01:47:34,299
[SPEAKER_37]: Eileen Lerner, name and address record, please.

1182
01:47:34,887 --> 01:47:39,091
[SPEAKER_50]: My name is Eileen Lerner, I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford.

1183
01:47:40,633 --> 01:47:44,297
[SPEAKER_50]: I'm here to represent the group Safe Medford.

1184
01:47:45,077 --> 01:47:54,267
[SPEAKER_50]: But before I read the statement of our group, I just would like to say that my family was destroyed by the Nazis.

1185
01:47:55,928 --> 01:48:07,925
[SPEAKER_50]: My great-grandparents, my great-aunts, my great-uncles, my cousins, they're all gone in Auschwitz, but I stand here in solidarity with the Palestinian people.

1186
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:21,985
[SPEAKER_50]: because I don't want what happened to us to happen to anybody else and it is happening and we need to stand against it.

1187
01:48:22,526 --> 01:48:25,828
[SPEAKER_50]: And here's the statement from Safe Medford.

1188
01:48:26,909 --> 01:48:32,873
[SPEAKER_50]: Safe Medford works to promote physical and emotional safety for everyone in Medford.

1189
01:48:33,653 --> 01:48:41,418
[SPEAKER_50]: We are deeply disturbed by recent incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia in our city and region.

1190
01:48:42,611 --> 01:49:03,770
[SPEAKER_50]: These incidents, whether swastikas painted on sidewalks in Medford, or the shooting of Palestinian college students in Vermont, reflect growing religious, ethnic, and national animosities that are being fueled by the violence against civilians in Israel and Palestine.

1191
01:49:03,790 --> 01:49:04,691
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you, Eileen.

1192
01:49:04,711 --> 01:49:05,071
[SPEAKER_50]: 30 seconds.

1193
01:49:05,111 --> 01:49:12,336
[SPEAKER_50]: This conflict is exacerbated by the supply of sophisticated weaponry funded with our tax dollars.

1194
01:49:12,896 --> 01:49:17,279
[SPEAKER_50]: We cannot stand aside as though this conflict does not concern us.

1195
01:49:17,839 --> 01:49:23,123
[SPEAKER_50]: We have safe Medford deplore the killing of innocent civilians wherever it takes place.

1196
01:49:23,923 --> 01:49:38,125
[SPEAKER_50]: Safe Medford calls on the Medford City Council to join the growing support for an immediate and lasting ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all houses hostages in Gaza and prisoners in Israel.

1197
01:49:40,077 --> 01:49:53,270
[SPEAKER_50]: urgent deployment of humanitarian aid in the region, and to denounce all acts of antisemitism and Islamophobia here in Medford and beyond our borders.

1198
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:53,710
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you.

1199
01:50:04,082 --> 01:50:05,263
[SPEAKER_37]: Next, we're going to go to Zoom.

1200
01:50:05,623 --> 01:50:07,083
[SPEAKER_37]: I have Devorah Klein.

1201
01:50:08,064 --> 01:50:09,604
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1202
01:50:09,624 --> 01:50:13,606
[SPEAKER_37]: You can provide your name and address or city, and then you'll have two minutes.

1203
01:50:13,646 --> 01:50:15,827
[SPEAKER_37]: I will give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.

1204
01:50:18,493 --> 01:50:19,214
[SPEAKER_67]: Thank you so much.

1205
01:50:19,614 --> 01:50:23,897
[SPEAKER_67]: As Councillor Scarpelli reminded us, on October 6th, there was a ceasefire in place.

1206
01:50:24,538 --> 01:50:27,560
[SPEAKER_67]: That ceasefire was ignored in the horrific attacks on the next day.

1207
01:50:28,321 --> 01:50:40,931
[SPEAKER_67]: Calling for a ceasefire without ensuring the return of the hostages and dismantling the terrorist regime of Hamas is just an invitation for Hamas to continue to try to destroy Israel, as they've already said they plan to do,

1208
01:50:41,671 --> 01:50:48,593
[SPEAKER_67]: and for them to continue to abuse the Palestinians as they have done so far, including hijacking aid being sent from Israel.

1209
01:50:49,293 --> 01:50:51,374
[SPEAKER_67]: A ceasefire sounds so appealing, isn't it?

1210
01:50:51,854 --> 01:51:03,578
[SPEAKER_67]: But without ensuring the safety of all, it is asking for more abuse of the Jews, Arabs, Christians, Muslims, Baha'i, and so many others who form the cohesive Israeli society.

1211
01:51:04,418 --> 01:51:09,944
[SPEAKER_67]: Contrary to popular belief, Jews have been in Israel for millennia up to the present, including my own family.

1212
01:51:10,624 --> 01:51:18,091
[SPEAKER_67]: A vote for this resolution says that you don't value those lives and it will make me feel unsafe in this community and that any of you might wish me ill.

1213
01:51:18,792 --> 01:51:19,153
[SPEAKER_67]: Thank you.

1214
01:51:20,894 --> 01:51:21,295
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1215
01:51:21,315 --> 01:51:25,038
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to go to the podium, name and address for the record.

1216
01:51:25,058 --> 01:51:27,841
[SPEAKER_53]: Ellen Epstein, I'm a Medford resident.

1217
01:51:27,861 --> 01:51:28,542
[SPEAKER_37]: All right, two minutes.

1218
01:51:29,921 --> 01:51:33,046
[SPEAKER_53]: I am an American Jew and no stranger to Israel.

1219
01:51:33,607 --> 01:51:37,834
[SPEAKER_53]: I have relatives there and at one point lived there for the better part of a year.

1220
01:51:39,386 --> 01:51:45,091
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm here tonight to urge the Medford City Council to speak out against this brutal conflict.

1221
01:51:46,192 --> 01:51:50,715
[SPEAKER_53]: Because I am Jewish, Israel's actions are being done in my name.

1222
01:51:51,796 --> 01:51:56,400
[SPEAKER_53]: Because I am American, the conflict is being fueled with my tax money.

1223
01:51:57,781 --> 01:52:03,146
[SPEAKER_53]: Therefore, I have not just the right, but the obligation to call for a ceasefire.

1224
01:52:04,494 --> 01:52:11,137
[SPEAKER_53]: I have demonstrated written emails made countless phone calls to our representatives in DC.

1225
01:52:12,138 --> 01:52:23,063
[SPEAKER_53]: I've joined with other Jewish members of the fifth congressional district to press Catherine Clark, the Democratic whip in the House of Representatives to call for a ceasefire.

1226
01:52:24,531 --> 01:52:31,176
[SPEAKER_53]: But my most direct line to political power is through you all, my city councilors.

1227
01:52:31,196 --> 01:52:35,479
[SPEAKER_53]: And yes, it makes a difference where you stand on this issue.

1228
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:41,983
[SPEAKER_53]: Your voice as a city council is louder than our individual voices can be.

1229
01:52:43,084 --> 01:52:49,449
[SPEAKER_53]: Please use your voice to add Medford to the growing number of cities and towns nationwide that are calling for ceasefire.

1230
01:52:50,816 --> 01:53:05,629
[SPEAKER_53]: You'd be taking sides, not with Israel, not with Hamas, but with the children and innocent men and women who continue to be the victims of brutality, day after day, week after week, month after month.

1231
01:53:06,370 --> 01:53:08,071
[SPEAKER_53]: Don't wait another minute.

1232
01:53:08,291 --> 01:53:11,154
[SPEAKER_53]: You can do this tonight, right here, right now.

1233
01:53:11,714 --> 01:53:16,198
[SPEAKER_53]: Please, take a stand for peace, take a stand for life.

1234
01:53:16,879 --> 01:53:17,800
[SPEAKER_53]: Ceasefire now.

1235
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:25,392
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1236
01:53:25,412 --> 01:53:26,915
[SPEAKER_60]: We have a hand on Zoom.

1237
01:53:27,456 --> 01:53:29,320
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to go to Kate on Zoom.

1238
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:31,605
[SPEAKER_37]: Kate, please provide your name and address for the record.

1239
01:53:31,665 --> 01:53:33,950
[SPEAKER_37]: I will give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.

1240
01:53:38,732 --> 01:53:51,782
[SPEAKER_56]: Hello, my name is Kate Ryan and I am on Warren Street in Medford and I am not at the city council meeting because as an autistic person, the environment is too hellish.

1241
01:53:52,342 --> 01:54:00,729
[SPEAKER_56]: And I am thinking about my brethren in Palestine right now who are suffering so much more.

1242
01:54:01,329 --> 01:54:03,491
[SPEAKER_56]: This is a mass disabling event.

1243
01:54:04,452 --> 01:54:06,873
[SPEAKER_56]: We should not be supporting

1244
01:54:07,970 --> 01:54:25,901
[SPEAKER_56]: this we need peace we need it now and I would like you to all think about the fact that in the past two hours we have been at this city council meeting approximately 10 children in Gaza have been killed and that is all

1245
01:54:34,889 --> 01:54:39,794
[SPEAKER_37]: to go to the podium, name and address for the record, and I'll give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.

1246
01:55:08,587 --> 01:55:11,748
[SPEAKER_37]: Jennifer, I'm sorry, could you press the button on the microphone?

1247
01:55:12,408 --> 01:55:13,428
[SPEAKER_37]: You may have tapped it off.

1248
01:55:14,869 --> 01:55:15,329
[SPEAKER_49]: Oh, okay.

1249
01:55:15,849 --> 01:55:16,769
[SPEAKER_49]: I don't need to start over, do I?

1250
01:55:17,069 --> 01:55:17,850
[SPEAKER_37]: No, no, no.

1251
01:55:18,210 --> 01:55:18,810
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, we heard you.

1252
01:55:18,850 --> 01:55:20,730
[SPEAKER_37]: We'll get it for the record.

1253
01:55:21,751 --> 01:55:30,553
[SPEAKER_49]: And we're furious that our tax dollars are being used for this morally reprehensible purpose, especially when there's so much need here at home.

1254
01:55:31,914 --> 01:55:38,675
[SPEAKER_49]: It's heartbreaking to see fellow human beings subjected to so much suffering on a daily and hourly basis.

1255
01:55:39,235 --> 01:55:49,137
[SPEAKER_49]: Tens of thousands have been killed and injured, children orphaned, the land destroyed, leaving a scorched earth where starvation and disease are now rampant.

1256
01:55:49,937 --> 01:55:53,198
[SPEAKER_49]: Is this what we want to do with our tax dollars?

1257
01:55:54,318 --> 01:56:00,239
[SPEAKER_49]: Today we're saying no, not on our watch, not in our name, not with our money.

1258
01:56:01,252 --> 01:56:08,458
[SPEAKER_49]: If our leaders at the federal level don't have the backbone to act, let the cities and towns of our country be the moral voice of the nation.

1259
01:56:09,339 --> 01:56:15,104
[SPEAKER_49]: Neighboring cities of Cambridge and Somerville have already taken a stand, and I urge you, let us join them.

1260
01:56:16,141 --> 01:56:23,122
[SPEAKER_49]: The United States has the power to stop this carnage today, simply by cutting off funds and demanding an immediate ceasefire.

1261
01:56:23,803 --> 01:56:32,424
[SPEAKER_49]: Please, please be our voice and speak out for an immediate end to this gross misuse of our public resources.

1262
01:56:33,044 --> 01:56:34,405
[SPEAKER_49]: Ceasefire now.

1263
01:56:34,425 --> 01:56:35,165
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

1264
01:56:35,205 --> 01:56:40,866
[SPEAKER_60]: We're going to go back to Zoom.

1265
01:56:42,861 --> 01:56:44,823
[SPEAKER_37]: Grace Parker on Zoom.

1266
01:56:45,384 --> 01:56:52,051
[SPEAKER_37]: Grace, I'll unmute you, ask for your name and address, and I'll give you a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning on a two-minute time limit.

1267
01:56:56,096 --> 01:56:56,336
[SPEAKER_37]: Go ahead.

1268
01:56:57,179 --> 01:56:59,940
[SPEAKER_45]: Hi, again, Grace Parker, Bell Lab, Medford.

1269
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:01,100
[SPEAKER_45]: I'll try to be quick.

1270
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:06,262
[SPEAKER_45]: I just wanted to say that I definitely agree with supporting this resolution.

1271
01:57:06,842 --> 01:57:11,824
[SPEAKER_45]: The atrocities in Gaza are, I mean, so many people have already spoken to this.

1272
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:23,327
[SPEAKER_45]: And I want to say thank you to the people that spoke about their personal experiences and also that I'm just so sorry that you are in this position and that so many people have failed you and failed our communities.

1273
01:57:26,738 --> 01:57:27,878
[SPEAKER_45]: That's really the crux of it.

1274
01:57:27,918 --> 01:57:31,220
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't wanna take up too much time just that I support this and I think you should all vote yes.

1275
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:34,541
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Grace.

1276
01:57:34,561 --> 01:57:38,462
[SPEAKER_37]: Go to the podium.

1277
01:57:39,723 --> 01:57:41,223
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

1278
01:57:41,343 --> 01:57:43,284
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'll give you a 30-second warning and 10-second warning.

1279
01:57:44,005 --> 01:57:45,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, my name is Beth Basciatelli.

1280
01:57:45,746 --> 01:57:46,927
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a Medford resident.

1281
01:57:47,867 --> 01:57:53,450
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would like to present a legal and moral argument for the council's consideration.

1282
01:57:53,930 --> 01:57:56,992
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a scholar of global governance and human security.

1283
01:57:58,673 --> 01:58:02,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Under international law, Israel is an occupying force.

1284
01:58:02,575 --> 01:58:04,056
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an occupying force.

1285
01:58:04,836 --> 01:58:07,078
[SPEAKER_13]: It is bound by the principle of protection.

1286
01:58:08,058 --> 01:58:14,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Under the Geneva Convention, its duty is to protect the population of Gaza, including civilians and civilian infrastructure.

1287
01:58:15,524 --> 01:58:20,948
[SPEAKER_13]: It is also bound by the principles of precaution, distinction, proportionality, and necessity.

1288
01:58:21,769 --> 01:58:27,714
[SPEAKER_13]: According to any of these principles of international law, Israel is guilty of a whole series of war crimes.

1289
01:58:29,286 --> 01:58:36,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Also based on international law, the United States is guilty of the crime of legal complicity, which is listed in the Geneva Convention.

1290
01:58:37,729 --> 01:58:41,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Complicity under the Genocide Convention is a crime.

1291
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:47,472
[SPEAKER_13]: It is legal complicity because it involves active support of a UN member state that is committing war crimes.

1292
01:58:48,173 --> 01:58:54,795
[SPEAKER_13]: The United States is providing economic, military, intelligence, and diplomatic support to block a ceasefire in Gaza.

1293
01:58:55,987 --> 01:59:01,288
[SPEAKER_13]: The genocide that is happening in Gaza could not happen without the support of the United States.

1294
01:59:02,209 --> 01:59:17,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Apart from the sheer loss of life and property, Israel's continued impunity in committing acts of genocide and the United States' ongoing acts of complicity put multilateralism and the entire international law establishment at risk.

1295
01:59:18,513 --> 01:59:35,995
[SPEAKER_13]: These acts have created a dangerous precedent whereby any authoritarian leader with ethno-nationalist ideologies who comes to power in any country, including the United States, can make a case for committing gross violations of international law.

1296
01:59:37,682 --> 01:59:45,189
[SPEAKER_13]: I recently attended a webinar with Craig Mobaker, who publicly resigned as director of the New York office of the high commissioner for human rights.

1297
01:59:45,249 --> 01:59:46,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And he said, do not doubt this.

1298
01:59:47,752 --> 01:59:50,494
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't care about Palestine, you are next.

1299
01:59:51,055 --> 01:59:59,223
[SPEAKER_13]: International human rights is the only thing that stands between powerful actors and those of us who care about living, moving and speaking freely.

1300
01:59:59,243 --> 02:00:00,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1301
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:08,141
[SPEAKER_60]: very, very soon.

1302
02:00:08,521 --> 02:00:11,103
[SPEAKER_37]: We have Marianne Vidal on zoom.

1303
02:00:11,143 --> 02:00:12,524
[SPEAKER_37]: Marianne, I'm going to unmute you.

1304
02:00:13,024 --> 02:00:15,525
[SPEAKER_37]: Please provide your name and address or the city you live in.

1305
02:00:15,546 --> 02:00:19,508
[SPEAKER_37]: And I will give you a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning.

1306
02:00:19,948 --> 02:00:20,949
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes.

1307
02:00:20,969 --> 02:00:28,814
[SPEAKER_39]: Hi there, I apologize my light isn't working in my room.

1308
02:00:29,614 --> 02:00:30,115
[SPEAKER_39]: Lifelong

1309
02:00:31,385 --> 02:00:37,610
[SPEAKER_39]: uh person i'm medfed i live on central ave i am here today demanding a ceasefire

1310
02:00:39,027 --> 02:00:42,849
[SPEAKER_39]: I refuse to take part in something where we're going to call people collateral damage.

1311
02:00:43,069 --> 02:00:47,251
[SPEAKER_39]: What we're seeing is not propaganda from Palestine.

1312
02:00:47,271 --> 02:00:48,632
[SPEAKER_39]: We are seeing murder.

1313
02:00:48,892 --> 02:00:50,093
[SPEAKER_39]: We are seeing genocide.

1314
02:00:50,113 --> 02:00:51,634
[SPEAKER_39]: We are seeing children crying.

1315
02:00:51,674 --> 02:00:54,135
[SPEAKER_39]: We are seeing mothers and fathers losing their kids.

1316
02:00:54,695 --> 02:01:05,180
[SPEAKER_39]: We are seeing the wipe out of a whole demographic of people and I can't sit by and just swipe up on a social media app for distraction anymore.

1317
02:01:05,701 --> 02:01:06,361
[SPEAKER_39]: Ceasefire now.

1318
02:01:09,872 --> 02:01:13,834
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1319
02:01:13,854 --> 02:01:17,155
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to go to the podium, name and address for the record, and you will have two minutes.

1320
02:01:17,195 --> 02:01:18,896
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.

1321
02:01:19,436 --> 02:01:19,756
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1322
02:01:19,836 --> 02:01:21,657
[SPEAKER_31]: Elie Strassfeld, West Street in Medford.

1323
02:01:22,938 --> 02:01:24,699
[SPEAKER_31]: I came here to commend the city council.

1324
02:01:24,979 --> 02:01:28,620
[SPEAKER_31]: I intended to commend the city council on this resolution and to speak out in favor of it.

1325
02:01:29,581 --> 02:01:32,402
[SPEAKER_31]: I believe Israel has a right to exist.

1326
02:01:33,142 --> 02:01:38,285
[SPEAKER_31]: I believe Israelis should not have to exist in the threat of Hamas, and because of that,

1327
02:01:39,474 --> 02:01:51,184
[SPEAKER_31]: I do not believe that an immediate ceasefire is justified, notwithstanding the heartbreaking stories, and I truly mean the heartbreaking stories I hear from my Medford neighbors.

1328
02:01:51,644 --> 02:01:55,667
[SPEAKER_31]: However, I absolutely do not believe that Israel has clean hands here.

1329
02:01:56,408 --> 02:02:05,614
[SPEAKER_31]: And I absolutely believe, as the resolution stated, that an enduring ceasefire is critical and a movement back to a two-state solution is critical.

1330
02:02:06,175 --> 02:02:10,658
[SPEAKER_31]: So I was thrilled to see that that's what the resolution said.

1331
02:02:11,522 --> 02:02:21,908
[SPEAKER_31]: I have to say I am appalled that I come here and the resolution now is so dramatically different in tone than what was originally posted on the website.

1332
02:02:22,628 --> 02:02:32,494
[SPEAKER_31]: I implore the city council to please move back to the previous resolution that was posted publicly and that people had an opportunity to review.

1333
02:02:33,114 --> 02:02:37,017
[SPEAKER_31]: It stands for something this entire city can get behind, I believe,

1334
02:02:37,717 --> 02:02:42,420
[SPEAKER_31]: And that is that we all need to work toward an enduring peace.

1335
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:55,548
[SPEAKER_31]: We don't need to have disputes about definition, about history, the historical context that Councilperson Collins shared was good context, but completely incomplete.

1336
02:02:56,609 --> 02:03:05,534
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'd ask that that part be stricken and that this council reverts to the version of this resolution that was previously before the council.

1337
02:03:05,694 --> 02:03:05,994
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1338
02:03:06,314 --> 02:03:06,675
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1339
02:03:08,092 --> 02:03:09,073
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

1340
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:17,919
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

1341
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,180
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, yeah.

1342
02:03:19,421 --> 02:03:22,002
[SPEAKER_37]: Sorry, Susan, we can't have a flag.

1343
02:03:22,022 --> 02:03:23,924
[SPEAKER_37]: There's a message on there.

1344
02:03:23,964 --> 02:03:25,665
[SPEAKER_37]: We don't have flags or signs in the chamber.

1345
02:03:26,306 --> 02:03:27,386
[SPEAKER_37]: Pardon?

1346
02:03:27,446 --> 02:03:29,628
[SPEAKER_37]: There's a message on your, yes.

1347
02:03:31,369 --> 02:03:32,510
[SPEAKER_37]: If you could hand it to Eileen for a minute.

1348
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:33,831
[SPEAKER_37]: But I am going to go to Zoom first.

1349
02:03:34,131 --> 02:03:36,793
[SPEAKER_37]: We have Amina Awad on Zoom.

1350
02:03:38,374 --> 02:03:39,494
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I'm going to unmute you.

1351
02:03:39,514 --> 02:03:49,218
[SPEAKER_37]: You can say your name, address and city or city, and give you a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning on a two minute timer for is yours.

1352
02:03:49,998 --> 02:03:53,560
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, my name is I mean I'm in speaking in favor of this resolution.

1353
02:03:53,580 --> 02:03:56,361
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm a resident of Somerville.

1354
02:03:57,817 --> 02:04:04,238
[SPEAKER_23]: And as someone who grew up in the Middle East, the lack of action in this country is unacceptable.

1355
02:04:05,338 --> 02:04:14,220
[SPEAKER_23]: I would be surprised at the shocking anti-Arab racism in this country had I not seen the legacy of racism and imperialism that remains.

1356
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:25,042
[SPEAKER_23]: Why are Palestinians always the last in politicians' speeches, including this council, who always mention Palestinians last, even though they're the ones that are victims of genocide?

1357
02:04:26,055 --> 02:04:29,780
[SPEAKER_23]: Palestinians who are dying deserve to be recognized and heard.

1358
02:04:30,621 --> 02:04:35,268
[SPEAKER_23]: My grandfather was forcibly displaced from Jerusalem by Zionist militia in 1948.

1359
02:04:35,748 --> 02:04:39,473
[SPEAKER_23]: This did not start on October 7th or with Hamas.

1360
02:04:40,765 --> 02:04:54,494
[SPEAKER_23]: The blockades on Gaza have existed for over a decade, and Israel has been killing Palestinians and stealing their land, conducting occupation and suppression for a long time, which is not a ceasefire, by the way.

1361
02:04:55,035 --> 02:04:57,316
[SPEAKER_23]: Gaza was living under military occupation.

1362
02:04:58,057 --> 02:05:00,939
[SPEAKER_23]: And now, as I'm witnessing millions of Palestinians go through

1363
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:07,363
[SPEAKER_23]: a second Nakba, which is a part of Israel's genocidal, colonial, and white supremacist regime.

1364
02:05:08,304 --> 02:05:16,589
[SPEAKER_23]: This resolution must pass for our collective liberation and for the Palestinians in Medford, Somerville, and beyond to feel safe and supported by this city.

1365
02:05:17,509 --> 02:05:27,472
[SPEAKER_23]: My grandfather, who was born in Jerusalem, died two hours away from Jerusalem in Man Jordan, never being able to return to his home, which is now occupied by settlers.

1366
02:05:28,352 --> 02:05:38,596
[SPEAKER_23]: So despite my family growing up for generations two hours outside the border of Jerusalem, not one of us has been able to step back into the city of our ancestors.

1367
02:05:39,476 --> 02:05:45,298
[SPEAKER_23]: And I also wanted to share a quote from a friend in Gaza who talks about

1368
02:05:46,269 --> 02:05:50,595
[SPEAKER_23]: One of his daily tasks in the North is burying the dead and decomposed bodies.

1369
02:05:51,136 --> 02:05:54,761
[SPEAKER_23]: Israeli forces have killed hundreds in the most horrific ways.

1370
02:05:55,162 --> 02:05:59,648
[SPEAKER_23]: Almost daily we find dead bodies that we need to decide where to bury.

1371
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:02,012
[SPEAKER_23]: Never did I think that my life at 21

1372
02:06:04,195 --> 02:06:06,396
[SPEAKER_23]: would be burying others.

1373
02:06:06,916 --> 02:06:18,200
[SPEAKER_23]: In order to move forward, I have to convince myself that I do not know the bodies that I am burying, when they in fact could be my neighbors, my friends, or even family members that have been missing under the rubble.

1374
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:27,984
[SPEAKER_23]: I implore you to think as a human being and to stand with justice and what is right and call for a ceasefire.

1375
02:06:28,444 --> 02:06:28,784
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1376
02:06:39,413 --> 02:06:42,194
[SPEAKER_37]: Please go to the podium.

1377
02:06:42,234 --> 02:06:43,094
[SPEAKER_37]: And thank you.

1378
02:06:43,114 --> 02:06:44,195
[SPEAKER_52]: My name is Susan Girard.

1379
02:06:44,795 --> 02:06:46,296
[SPEAKER_52]: I've been living in Medford.

1380
02:06:46,356 --> 02:06:47,436
[SPEAKER_52]: I live on Farragut Ave.

1381
02:06:47,556 --> 02:06:49,677
[SPEAKER_52]: I've been living in Medford for 40 years.

1382
02:06:50,837 --> 02:06:51,417
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm Jewish.

1383
02:06:51,437 --> 02:06:53,258
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm a mother and a grandmother.

1384
02:06:53,278 --> 02:06:55,299
[SPEAKER_52]: And my message is really simple.

1385
02:06:56,279 --> 02:07:05,502
[SPEAKER_52]: As people have stated, out of the 27,000 and growing children that have been killed under these bombs that our tax dollars are supporting,

1386
02:07:07,863 --> 02:07:12,144
[SPEAKER_52]: out of the 27,000 people, over half of them are children.

1387
02:07:12,164 --> 02:07:23,607
[SPEAKER_52]: I cannot believe, for anyone who believes that the safety of Israel is important, I cannot believe that you are safe when you kill other people's children.

1388
02:07:23,627 --> 02:07:25,868
[SPEAKER_52]: And that's my statement, thank you.

1389
02:07:33,709 --> 02:07:36,150
[SPEAKER_37]: Seeing no more hands on Zoom, we're gonna stick with the podium.

1390
02:07:36,991 --> 02:07:38,412
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

1391
02:07:38,432 --> 02:07:39,032
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes.

1392
02:07:39,092 --> 02:07:41,453
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll give you a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.

1393
02:07:41,814 --> 02:07:42,534
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, thank you.

1394
02:07:42,634 --> 02:07:44,155
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, I'm Rebecca Butorsky.

1395
02:07:44,175 --> 02:07:46,396
[SPEAKER_41]: I live on Diane Road in Medford.

1396
02:07:47,377 --> 02:07:48,998
[SPEAKER_41]: I'll very briefly introduce myself.

1397
02:07:49,178 --> 02:07:54,101
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm a scientist, I'm a mom, I'm a Jew, and I'm a descendant of Holocaust survivors.

1398
02:07:54,741 --> 02:08:01,525
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm compelled to speak in favor of the ceasefire resolution brought by Councilor Collins for both political and also personal reasons.

1399
02:08:02,105 --> 02:08:08,430
[SPEAKER_41]: First of all, I join Palestinians and Israelis who are mourning the senseless loss of life and I condemn violence against civilians.

1400
02:08:08,990 --> 02:08:15,655
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm urging you to pass this resolution tonight because of the role that the US plays in this current war between Israel and Palestine.

1401
02:08:16,376 --> 02:08:22,961
[SPEAKER_41]: Israel is the largest recipient of US foreign aid since World War Two and the US is its major supplier of weapons.

1402
02:08:23,601 --> 02:08:23,921
[SPEAKER_41]: The U.S.

1403
02:08:23,961 --> 02:08:36,490
[SPEAKER_41]: therefore has a huge leverage to deescalate this current crisis, and if it doesn't, this catastrophe may escalate into a greater war in the region and causing more civilian deaths.

1404
02:08:37,011 --> 02:08:40,694
[SPEAKER_41]: We must urge our representatives to join the growing calls for a ceasefire.

1405
02:08:41,574 --> 02:08:49,397
[SPEAKER_41]: Second, I'm compelled to speak personally on behalf of my grandmother, whose entire family was killed in the Holocaust, except for her and her sister, who were able to escape.

1406
02:08:50,037 --> 02:08:57,900
[SPEAKER_41]: She witnessed genocide and she lived to teach her children and grandchildren to speak up and work towards a world where this will never happen again.

1407
02:08:58,620 --> 02:09:09,904
[SPEAKER_41]: When I read that entire families in Gaza are being killed and that others are being displaced for the second and third time from their homes, I know that my grandmother would not want this done in her name, and I would not want this done in mine.

1408
02:09:10,264 --> 02:09:10,564
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1409
02:09:12,595 --> 02:09:12,657
[SPEAKER_60]: you.

1410
02:09:20,336 --> 02:09:21,777
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, name and address for the record.

1411
02:09:21,797 --> 02:09:22,437
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes.

1412
02:09:22,557 --> 02:09:25,599
[SPEAKER_51]: Clare Sheridan, 190 High Street, Medford.

1413
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:27,701
[SPEAKER_51]: I support the resolution.

1414
02:09:27,921 --> 02:09:40,930
[SPEAKER_51]: Although not Jewish myself, I was an ardent supporter of the state of Israel until about 20 years ago when I began questioning Israel's treatment of its Palestinian neighbors.

1415
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:48,595
[SPEAKER_51]: So I traveled to Israel-Palestine twice over the last 15 years to educate myself.

1416
02:09:49,295 --> 02:09:56,527
[SPEAKER_51]: I had two personal experiences that I want to convey because they are emblematic of what I found.

1417
02:09:57,469 --> 02:10:02,337
[SPEAKER_51]: On one trip, I was with a group of American tourists in Hebron in the West Bank.

1418
02:10:03,598 --> 02:10:07,061
[SPEAKER_51]: We were watching a group of little children exiting their school.

1419
02:10:07,541 --> 02:10:11,325
[SPEAKER_51]: The street was lined with Israeli soldiers with machine guns.

1420
02:10:12,325 --> 02:10:17,530
[SPEAKER_51]: One said to me loudly in English, why are you watching that vermin?

1421
02:10:18,711 --> 02:10:24,496
[SPEAKER_51]: I almost reminded him that that was what the Nazis called his forebears.

1422
02:10:25,497 --> 02:10:28,459
[SPEAKER_51]: But I held my tongue, he had a gun after all.

1423
02:10:29,781 --> 02:10:32,947
[SPEAKER_51]: On another trip, I was at the airport heading home.

1424
02:10:33,748 --> 02:10:36,172
[SPEAKER_51]: I was pulled aside and interrogated.

1425
02:10:36,633 --> 02:10:40,661
[SPEAKER_51]: My bags were searched separately and my passport withheld.

1426
02:10:41,801 --> 02:10:42,141
[SPEAKER_51]: Why?

1427
02:10:42,161 --> 02:10:50,304
[SPEAKER_51]: I had a stamp in my passport from a previous trip to Bosnia to visit an American friend's relatives.

1428
02:10:51,064 --> 02:10:55,485
[SPEAKER_51]: The security guy asked me, so, do you love Muslims?

1429
02:10:56,545 --> 02:11:02,767
[SPEAKER_51]: He wanted to know the names of the people I visited in Bosnia and the names of my friend in the US.

1430
02:11:03,527 --> 02:11:08,809
[SPEAKER_51]: I responded sweetly that my Bosnian friend's husband was Jewish.

1431
02:11:10,609 --> 02:11:15,352
[SPEAKER_51]: The official became very angry and shouted something I won't repeat.

1432
02:11:16,393 --> 02:11:19,655
[SPEAKER_51]: I responded, only in America.

1433
02:11:20,676 --> 02:11:22,397
[SPEAKER_51]: He let me catch my plane.

1434
02:11:22,737 --> 02:11:23,697
[SPEAKER_38]: You have 10 seconds, Claire.

1435
02:11:23,718 --> 02:11:24,278
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1436
02:11:24,398 --> 02:11:24,778
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1437
02:11:34,565 --> 02:11:36,246
[SPEAKER_37]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium.

1438
02:11:36,286 --> 02:11:37,687
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

1439
02:11:37,747 --> 02:11:38,127
[SPEAKER_37]: Two minutes.

1440
02:11:38,971 --> 02:11:40,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, my name is Anna Meyer.

1441
02:11:40,432 --> 02:11:45,955
[SPEAKER_18]: I live at 6 Douglas Road in Medford, and I'm a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford.

1442
02:11:46,756 --> 02:11:51,799
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm here tonight to urge you to vote for the ceasefire resolutions with the amendments proposed by Councilor Collins.

1443
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:56,962
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that passing this resolution will have two incredibly important impacts on our community.

1444
02:11:57,663 --> 02:12:03,507
[SPEAKER_18]: First, passing this resolution is an affirmation that Medford is a community that values all of its residents.

1445
02:12:04,187 --> 02:12:08,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Ruth Wilson Gilmore tells us that where life is precious, life is precious.

1446
02:12:08,669 --> 02:12:17,514
[SPEAKER_18]: What she means by that is that when we intentionally create communities that affirm the life of every person is meaningful, all people have the capacity to thrive.

1447
02:12:18,134 --> 02:12:22,477
[SPEAKER_18]: The death count in Gaza has surpassed 27,000 individuals that we can count.

1448
02:12:23,117 --> 02:12:25,278
[SPEAKER_18]: At least 10,000 of those deaths are children.

1449
02:12:25,818 --> 02:12:30,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Thousands more are displaced without access to food, clean water, or medical care.

1450
02:12:31,081 --> 02:12:37,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Passing a ceasefire resolution affirms that Medford is a community that opposes this needless violence.

1451
02:12:37,723 --> 02:12:49,247
[SPEAKER_18]: And it also affirms that Medford is a community that believes that the life of our Muslim and Arab siblings, as well as all of our neighbors that have experienced state sanctioned violence and the harms of colonialism are precious.

1452
02:12:50,242 --> 02:12:58,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Second, passing this resolution puts important pressure on our federal elected officials who can use their power to call for a permanent and immediate ceasefire.

1453
02:12:59,372 --> 02:13:05,900
[SPEAKER_18]: This resolution will put pressure on Representatives Clark and Senators Warren and Markey to end the current humanitarian crisis.

1454
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:15,565
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll also put pressure on them to vote against the legislation that's currently before the Senate that will provide an upwards of $14 billion in military aid to Israel.

1455
02:13:16,445 --> 02:13:21,088
[SPEAKER_18]: And this will help ensure that our tax dollars do not go towards intensifying a genocide.

1456
02:13:21,668 --> 02:13:31,613
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that, I urge you to pass a ceasefire resolution tonight so that we can affirm the preciousness of the lives of all of our neighbors and to use our voice to call for an end to this violence.

1457
02:13:32,313 --> 02:13:32,714
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1458
02:13:32,914 --> 02:13:35,215
[SPEAKER_60]: And I apologize for missing the warning.

1459
02:13:40,814 --> 02:13:42,852
[SPEAKER_37]: name and address for the record, and I'll remember the 30 seconds.

1460
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:47,961
[SPEAKER_74]: Thanks, Travis Benson, 353 Main Street on Medford.

1461
02:13:47,981 --> 02:13:51,383
[SPEAKER_74]: I am aware this is a scarf and not a keffiyeh.

1462
02:13:51,403 --> 02:13:57,845
[SPEAKER_74]: I'm doing my best, but I am here to support the resolution as it is currently amended for ceasefire.

1463
02:13:57,865 --> 02:14:02,126
[SPEAKER_74]: I don't know what else to say tonight that won't already be said.

1464
02:14:02,146 --> 02:14:11,589
[SPEAKER_74]: There'll be many mentions from everyone here of the atrocities and casualties that have been going on with the decades long conflict with Israel and Palestine.

1465
02:14:15,392 --> 02:14:27,746
[SPEAKER_74]: Maybe I'm simplistic and rigid in my thinking, but this conversation becomes really difficult for me whenever it strays away from the overwhelming asymmetric casualty rate that has continued for decades.

1466
02:14:31,750 --> 02:14:37,577
[SPEAKER_74]: as if this is a nuanced issue and that the agitation and cause of the loss of life must be explained or elaborated on further.

1467
02:14:38,378 --> 02:14:51,673
[SPEAKER_74]: As more and more towns and cities pass these resolutions, and taking a stance on a ceasefire becomes much safer for everyone's public image and costs less and less political capital, history will look less and less fondly towards votes

1468
02:14:52,674 --> 02:14:58,698
[SPEAKER_74]: not in favor of this resolution, attempts to delay its passage, or suggestions to water the language down.

1469
02:14:59,358 --> 02:15:18,570
[SPEAKER_74]: I've witnessed in-person other city meetings that have already taken votes on a ceasefire, and I would just like to note that it is very obvious to everyone watching, and will be even more obvious tomorrow, of the strong dissonance and disconnect that exists between the visible turnout in this room versus the passivity and appeasement that exists in all of tonight's four speeches.

1470
02:15:20,111 --> 02:15:22,173
[SPEAKER_24]: We must always recognize that- 30 seconds, Travis.

1471
02:15:22,593 --> 02:15:22,973
[SPEAKER_74]: Gotcha.

1472
02:15:24,314 --> 02:15:30,579
[SPEAKER_74]: It should not take this much effort, time, and energy to take a non-watered down stance on a genocide.

1473
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:42,989
[SPEAKER_74]: It does not help us, your constituents, feel confident about your actions and representation on less urgent and less catastrophic issues if you do not take the strongest action on this resolution yesterday.

1474
02:15:43,009 --> 02:15:43,550
[SPEAKER_74]: 10 seconds.

1475
02:15:43,730 --> 02:15:44,110
[SPEAKER_74]: Thank you.

1476
02:15:44,230 --> 02:15:44,751
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Travis.

1477
02:15:53,837 --> 02:15:54,583
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address the record.

1478
02:15:54,603 --> 02:15:56,457
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll give a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning.

1479
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:58,641
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Sharon.

1480
02:15:58,741 --> 02:16:00,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I live at 14 Winter Hill Road in Medford.

1481
02:16:02,003 --> 02:16:04,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've lived here for about a year and a half, and I really like it.

1482
02:16:04,545 --> 02:16:08,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working with the group Medford for Palestine to organize our city around this resolution.

1483
02:16:08,748 --> 02:16:15,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't pretend to fully understand the deep complexities of the Israel-Palestine conflict that's been going on for decades.

1484
02:16:16,154 --> 02:16:19,796
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not personally implicated in it because of my religious or ethnic identity.

1485
02:16:20,237 --> 02:16:25,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, I'm immensely privileged and obligated to educate myself, hold space for others, and stand up for peace.

1486
02:16:26,181 --> 02:16:30,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody in this room is under the illusion that Medford's resolution will put a stop to the violence overnight.

1487
02:16:30,903 --> 02:16:38,966
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I believe with every piece of my heart that many small actions can coalesce into something substantial that our federal government might actually listen to.

1488
02:16:39,706 --> 02:16:45,269
[SPEAKER_07]: That means we must take seriously our local actions on global matters, not dismiss them as beyond our scope.

1489
02:16:46,369 --> 02:16:52,091
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the stepping stones with which we build a world we truly love and believe in and can trust to hold our future generations.

1490
02:16:52,892 --> 02:16:55,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope we pass a ceasefire resolution tonight.

1491
02:16:55,813 --> 02:17:09,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that our collective actions shake the US government out of the nightmare that it is perpetuating by supplying bombs, weapons, and our tax dollars to fund Israel's militant campaign, which is destroying Palestinian lives under the false pretense of protecting Jewish ones.

1492
02:17:10,259 --> 02:17:15,507
[SPEAKER_07]: We are all watching a genocide unfold on every screen we look at, at all hours of the day, every single day.

1493
02:17:15,708 --> 02:17:17,130
[SPEAKER_07]: We cannot do nothing.

1494
02:17:17,871 --> 02:17:18,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Palestine deserves peace.

1495
02:17:19,273 --> 02:17:20,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace requires freedom.

1496
02:17:21,016 --> 02:17:21,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Free Palestine.

1497
02:17:21,657 --> 02:17:22,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Ceasefire now.

1498
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:33,963
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, in one second, I just want to say, if you are on Zoom and you would like to speak, please raise your hand.

1499
02:17:34,043 --> 02:17:35,084
[SPEAKER_37]: But I see no hands.

1500
02:17:35,504 --> 02:17:36,204
[SPEAKER_37]: Go to the podium.

1501
02:17:36,625 --> 02:17:37,705
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record.

1502
02:17:38,125 --> 02:17:40,747
[SPEAKER_37]: Two minutes, and I'll give a 30-second and a 10-second warning.

1503
02:17:42,162 --> 02:17:42,622
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll be brief.

1504
02:17:43,383 --> 02:17:44,643
[SPEAKER_43]: I am Simcha Miller.

1505
02:17:44,903 --> 02:17:50,606
[SPEAKER_43]: I live on 59 Winchester Street here in Somerville, Medford, my bad, sorry.

1506
02:17:50,806 --> 02:17:55,128
[SPEAKER_43]: It's been a long day, came from work.

1507
02:17:55,508 --> 02:17:59,570
[SPEAKER_43]: I have not been a resident of Medford for that long, but I grew up four miles away.

1508
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:09,774
[SPEAKER_43]: And I am a proud observant Jew that wakes up every day disgusted that this is done in my name.

1509
02:18:12,342 --> 02:18:15,365
[SPEAKER_43]: And I don't want to say more.

1510
02:18:15,385 --> 02:18:18,609
[SPEAKER_43]: There have been other people who have said what I've said from my position.

1511
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:20,350
[SPEAKER_43]: I didn't really prepare in advance.

1512
02:18:21,612 --> 02:18:22,192
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm a teacher.

1513
02:18:25,855 --> 02:18:28,736
[SPEAKER_43]: I was raised by a union nurse, local.

1514
02:18:30,497 --> 02:18:37,681
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think that I wanna bring it back to you are our voice, our voices aren't being heard otherwise.

1515
02:18:38,801 --> 02:18:41,282
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a way for us to amplify our voices.

1516
02:18:41,763 --> 02:18:53,269
[SPEAKER_43]: And specifically, I wanna draw back the attention to the personal horrors and anecdotes that were shared earlier by my neighbors here in Medford.

1517
02:18:54,269 --> 02:19:05,599
[SPEAKER_43]: that are Palestinian and have been facing the unknowns of every single day facing this horror.

1518
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:14,367
[SPEAKER_43]: I urge the city council to please put forward this amended resolution.

1519
02:19:14,387 --> 02:19:16,149
[SPEAKER_38]: You have 30 seconds.

1520
02:19:18,551 --> 02:19:19,492
[SPEAKER_43]: And that's all.

1521
02:19:20,132 --> 02:19:20,533
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1522
02:19:28,319 --> 02:19:30,539
[SPEAKER_60]: Hello, name and address for the record, please.

1523
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:34,260
[SPEAKER_26]: Hello, I'm Esther Alter, I live in Medford.

1524
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:54,865
[SPEAKER_26]: I am a Jew, and I grew up in a very Zionist synagogue, and I'm well aware of the emotional component to this, that the Zionists want security, and they're on a perpetual defensive posture.

1525
02:19:57,887 --> 02:19:58,868
[SPEAKER_26]: I am not a Zionist.

1526
02:19:59,708 --> 02:20:03,349
[SPEAKER_26]: We are a minority, and we always will be.

1527
02:20:04,690 --> 02:20:10,132
[SPEAKER_26]: And our safety is contingent on being generous and empathetic neighbors.

1528
02:20:12,074 --> 02:20:30,701
[SPEAKER_26]: If the institutions ostensibly representing our interests continue to fail to call for the end of the genocide of our neighbors because they don't want to divide a community or make some people feel unsafe, then we will always be divided, and we will never be safe.

1529
02:20:30,981 --> 02:20:31,701
[SPEAKER_26]: Cease fire now.

1530
02:20:31,721 --> 02:20:33,282
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

1531
02:20:41,485 --> 02:20:43,426
[SPEAKER_37]: name and address for the record, please, you have two minutes.

1532
02:20:44,207 --> 02:20:47,449
[SPEAKER_47]: Deborah Cooper, 112 Lawrence Street, Medford.

1533
02:20:49,250 --> 02:20:58,356
[SPEAKER_47]: I stand for the sanctity of human life and culture, and I admire the courage of this council in bringing this motion forward.

1534
02:20:58,456 --> 02:21:09,763
[SPEAKER_47]: Beloved American poet Maya Angelou has said that of all the virtues, courage is the most important because without it, no other virtues can be performed consistently.

1535
02:21:11,533 --> 02:21:14,236
[SPEAKER_47]: How do you build the courage to stand up to injustice?

1536
02:21:15,036 --> 02:21:21,502
[SPEAKER_47]: You start with something small, like a weightlifter who begins with a few pounds and builds up to 100.

1537
02:21:22,283 --> 02:21:26,947
[SPEAKER_47]: You stand up against injustice and it feels good, so you do more.

1538
02:21:28,349 --> 02:21:36,036
[SPEAKER_47]: Six years ago, we stood up against injustice and the Muslim immigration ban, and that felt good.

1539
02:21:37,702 --> 02:21:45,349
[SPEAKER_47]: Along with many Medford residents, I ask this council to show your courage by passing the ceasefire resolution.

1540
02:21:46,110 --> 02:21:47,972
[SPEAKER_47]: Free Palestine, ceasefire now.

1541
02:21:47,992 --> 02:21:50,354
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1542
02:21:55,916 --> 02:21:56,877
[SPEAKER_00]: name and address for the record.

1543
02:21:56,897 --> 02:21:57,698
[SPEAKER_00]: You have two minutes.

1544
02:21:58,018 --> 02:21:59,299
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Nathan Foster.

1545
02:21:59,419 --> 02:22:01,621
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 163 Main Street in Medford.

1546
02:22:01,781 --> 02:22:04,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Medford resident and I'm Jewish.

1547
02:22:04,143 --> 02:22:06,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here in support of a ceasefire now.

1548
02:22:06,686 --> 02:22:08,948
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank the council for bringing this resolution forward.

1549
02:22:10,729 --> 02:22:15,613
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening in Gaza right now, what the Israeli military is doing in Gaza is morally indefensible.

1550
02:22:15,794 --> 02:22:17,815
[SPEAKER_00]: It is horrific and

1551
02:22:18,536 --> 02:22:22,399
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just plain wrong, and that's reason enough to support this resolution.

1552
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:28,965
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to speak to some things that have been brought up around the issue of the safety of Jewish people.

1553
02:22:29,405 --> 02:22:31,507
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandparents were Holocaust survivors.

1554
02:22:31,567 --> 02:22:39,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I take this very seriously, and I would just like to state that the war that is being waged by Israel in the name of the safety of Jewish people has nothing to do with that.

1555
02:22:40,274 --> 02:22:41,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely nothing to do with that.

1556
02:22:41,554 --> 02:22:42,675
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a war of revenge.

1557
02:22:43,235 --> 02:22:45,776
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, for some, a war of territorial expansion.

1558
02:22:46,216 --> 02:22:47,236
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about safety.

1559
02:22:48,817 --> 02:23:00,361
[SPEAKER_00]: One phrase that is used to describe Israel's repeated attacks on Gaza since 2008, which once I heard it, I couldn't unhear, is mowing the grass.

1560
02:23:01,061 --> 02:23:06,526
[SPEAKER_00]: This is used to describe these repeated attacks as something that is inevitable and will just keep happening.

1561
02:23:07,087 --> 02:23:15,535
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a dehumanizing and normalizing phrase, but it also speaks to the futility of these cycles of violence and the fact that

1562
02:23:16,716 --> 02:23:26,305
[SPEAKER_00]: And Israel, which is oppressing the Palestinian people, which is denying basic freedom, basic human rights, will never achieve the kind of safety that is talked about.

1563
02:23:26,565 --> 02:23:28,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety can only come through peace.

1564
02:23:28,727 --> 02:23:31,170
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only come through the freedom and human rights of Palestinians.

1565
02:23:31,390 --> 02:23:32,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1566
02:23:32,831 --> 02:23:33,192
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1567
02:23:39,634 --> 02:23:40,515
[SPEAKER_60]: for the record.

1568
02:23:40,535 --> 02:23:42,676
[SPEAKER_60]: You have two minutes and I'll provide two warnings.

1569
02:23:43,176 --> 02:23:46,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Benjamin, 76 Marion Street, Medford.

1570
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:49,340
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a recent new Medford resident.

1571
02:23:49,580 --> 02:23:53,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the resolution being forward today and I want to speak in support of it.

1572
02:23:53,722 --> 02:23:59,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any personal ties to Palestine or Israel, but like many here, the events unfolding since October 7th have deeply impacted me.

1573
02:24:00,506 --> 02:24:08,251
[SPEAKER_01]: The ongoing killing in Gaza and the West Bank, the displacement of an entire people from their homes without a safe place to go, without enough food, water, medicine is horrifying.

1574
02:24:09,071 --> 02:24:13,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a resident of this country, I feel the responsibility to speak up today because the U.S.

1575
02:24:13,796 --> 02:24:15,779
[SPEAKER_01]: is not just a powerful player in this conflict.

1576
02:24:16,219 --> 02:24:17,401
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have just leverage.

1577
02:24:17,861 --> 02:24:21,625
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, alongside Israel, the main perpetrator of the suffering of the Palestinian people.

1578
02:24:22,106 --> 02:24:22,747
[SPEAKER_01]: It is with U.S.

1579
02:24:22,787 --> 02:24:23,447
[SPEAKER_01]: bombs and U.S.

1580
02:24:23,467 --> 02:24:26,711
[SPEAKER_01]: fighter jets that the Israeli military has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians.

1581
02:24:28,473 --> 02:24:31,074
[SPEAKER_01]: It is our administration that has and continues to fund this war.

1582
02:24:31,554 --> 02:24:37,275
[SPEAKER_01]: It is our administration that stands alone in the world in vetoing one ceasefire resolution after another in the UN Security Council.

1583
02:24:37,716 --> 02:24:45,698
[SPEAKER_01]: It is our administration that two weeks ago suspended all funding for the main UN organization providing humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza, the UNRWA.

1584
02:24:46,518 --> 02:24:53,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Our elected administration is not just a bystander to this genocide, but an active participant that is able to stop this war tomorrow if it wants to.

1585
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:57,101
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I think it matters that cities like Medford pass a ceasefire resolution.

1586
02:24:58,121 --> 02:25:17,842
[SPEAKER_01]: It demonstrates to our community, in particular its Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, as well as Jewish and Israeli members, that we care about their lives and that of their relatives, friends, colleagues, that we fully condemn the loss of life, the complete destruction of housing and basic human services and goods in Gaza, that we value all human life, that we want everyone to feel safe here and to feel comfortable to speak up.

1587
02:25:18,604 --> 02:25:26,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And it demonstrates to our government that the city of Medford does not stand behind the support of the ongoing genocide, that we stand for peace and immediate ceasefire now.

1588
02:25:27,187 --> 02:25:33,489
[SPEAKER_01]: The more cities that pass resolutions like this, the higher will be the pressure on Biden to stop this war now.

1589
02:25:33,629 --> 02:25:33,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1590
02:25:34,189 --> 02:25:34,630
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1591
02:25:43,072 --> 02:25:44,293
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

1592
02:25:45,179 --> 02:25:45,859
[SPEAKER_69]: the resolution.

1593
02:25:45,879 --> 02:25:47,621
[SPEAKER_69]: Brianna Sullivan, 28 Princeton Street.

1594
02:25:48,501 --> 02:25:55,246
[SPEAKER_69]: Um many others here have spoken tonight much more eloquently than I ever could on the broader issue, so I will be brief.

1595
02:25:56,146 --> 02:26:04,932
[SPEAKER_69]: I'm in favor of the resolution to support a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza, and specifically I am in favor of the city

1596
02:26:15,512 --> 02:26:25,975
[SPEAKER_69]: As the amended version was being read out loud, I was reading the original version along, following line by line, and I noticed every change that was made, and I support them all.

1597
02:26:26,535 --> 02:26:36,017
[SPEAKER_69]: I appreciate everything that Councilperson Collins did to put those changes into place, as well as putting forth the original resolution.

1598
02:26:36,037 --> 02:26:40,378
[SPEAKER_69]: I urge you all to pass this version and to vote on it tonight.

1599
02:26:40,778 --> 02:26:42,019
[SPEAKER_69]: Thank you, cease fire now.

1600
02:26:49,602 --> 02:26:51,383
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please, or the city.

1601
02:26:52,724 --> 02:26:54,206
[SPEAKER_72]: Hi, my name is Marie.

1602
02:26:54,546 --> 02:26:57,148
[SPEAKER_72]: I live at 31 Gleason Street in Medford.

1603
02:26:59,169 --> 02:27:03,853
[SPEAKER_72]: I came here tonight because I'm a Medford parent.

1604
02:27:04,193 --> 02:27:07,416
[SPEAKER_72]: I have two children, ages two and six.

1605
02:27:08,076 --> 02:27:15,562
[SPEAKER_72]: And my youngest, she goes to a home daycare, and her daycare teacher is a Palestinian.

1606
02:27:17,031 --> 02:27:30,401
[SPEAKER_72]: And every day that I drop her off and pick her up, I see her face just, it's puffy, she's hiding it, but I know that she cries daily while trying to take care of these children.

1607
02:27:31,983 --> 02:27:36,506
[SPEAKER_72]: And so I'm here just holding her in my heart, honestly.

1608
02:27:37,307 --> 02:27:46,293
[SPEAKER_72]: And I had this whole thing that I was going to read that I read earlier at the rally, but the personal testimonies

1609
02:27:47,715 --> 02:27:52,738
[SPEAKER_72]: from these people back here is more powerful than anything I could ever say.

1610
02:27:53,758 --> 02:28:03,863
[SPEAKER_72]: So what I will say is that I'm just going to quote Motaz Azizia, who is one of the heroes of Gaza.

1611
02:28:04,483 --> 02:28:10,006
[SPEAKER_72]: He has more followers than the president of the United States as a result of all of this.

1612
02:28:13,203 --> 02:28:16,626
[SPEAKER_72]: And he has truly brought this genocide to our hands.

1613
02:28:16,806 --> 02:28:18,667
[SPEAKER_24]: You have 30 seconds, Pri.

1614
02:28:20,049 --> 02:28:21,630
[SPEAKER_72]: He's brought awareness to the world.

1615
02:28:22,491 --> 02:28:31,658
[SPEAKER_72]: And so I'm just going to quote him on his 107th day when he was finally able to flee Gaza and just say, always remember to say, free Palestine.

1616
02:28:33,459 --> 02:28:34,020
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1617
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:40,525
[SPEAKER_37]: Hello.

1618
02:28:40,625 --> 02:28:41,746
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

1619
02:28:41,766 --> 02:28:42,407
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes.

1620
02:28:43,368 --> 02:28:44,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, my name is Eric Fox.

1621
02:28:44,708 --> 02:28:46,449
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at 10 Revere Place.

1622
02:28:48,189 --> 02:28:54,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I first of all, foremost want to thank the Councilor Collins for bringing forth this resolution calling for a ceasefire.

1623
02:28:55,291 --> 02:28:57,191
[SPEAKER_11]: I personally am Jewish.

1624
02:28:57,391 --> 02:29:09,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I have, like many others that have spoken today, have grandparents that were survivors of the Holocaust and other members of my family who I never got to know because they were killed.

1625
02:29:09,074 --> 02:29:09,134
[SPEAKER_11]: But

1626
02:29:12,062 --> 02:29:17,904
[SPEAKER_11]: More importantly, I've experienced antisemitism in my life.

1627
02:29:17,984 --> 02:29:24,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I have also experienced and seen and witnessed Islamophobia and xenophobia in this community.

1628
02:29:25,107 --> 02:29:36,772
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I applaud the council for bringing and talking about this issue and just hearing all of these stories tonight, hearing everyone and hearing how this conflict has been affecting them.

1629
02:29:37,472 --> 02:29:45,236
[SPEAKER_11]: personally makes it clear that this is not purely a national issue that should be ignored by a local city council.

1630
02:29:46,017 --> 02:29:50,439
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not something that doesn't qualify as a local Medford issue.

1631
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:56,803
[SPEAKER_11]: This clearly is a Medford issue that is affecting its residents and in a very deep and personal way.

1632
02:29:57,623 --> 02:30:11,256
[SPEAKER_11]: So I encourage you to vote for this ceasefire amendment, the amended version in the resolution, and I hope you do because it clearly is very important to Medford locals.

1633
02:30:11,816 --> 02:30:12,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1634
02:30:12,197 --> 02:30:16,080
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

1635
02:30:20,993 --> 02:30:22,714
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes, my name is Dina Alemi.

1636
02:30:23,114 --> 02:30:25,175
[SPEAKER_40]: I live at 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1637
02:30:25,995 --> 02:30:33,479
[SPEAKER_40]: I was not prepared to speak tonight, but I felt that as a Palestinian American, I should share my story and my family's story.

1638
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:40,522
[SPEAKER_40]: My parents both grew up in Jaffa, which is now Israel.

1639
02:30:40,922 --> 02:30:44,124
[SPEAKER_40]: They were also forcefully pushed out into Gaza.

1640
02:30:45,464 --> 02:30:48,286
[SPEAKER_40]: I have lost a lot of family in Gaza.

1641
02:30:51,478 --> 02:30:54,700
[SPEAKER_40]: Many of my family members in the North do not have food.

1642
02:30:55,901 --> 02:31:03,506
[SPEAKER_40]: They are lucky that their house is still standing, but all they're really eating is herbs and contaminated water.

1643
02:31:04,666 --> 02:31:06,448
[SPEAKER_40]: This is not a political issue.

1644
02:31:07,622 --> 02:31:09,243
[SPEAKER_40]: This is a humanity issue.

1645
02:31:10,343 --> 02:31:11,783
[SPEAKER_40]: We need to support this.

1646
02:31:11,963 --> 02:31:14,164
[SPEAKER_40]: We need to be there for the people.

1647
02:31:14,985 --> 02:31:16,765
[SPEAKER_40]: And I thank you all for listening.

1648
02:31:17,425 --> 02:31:20,566
[SPEAKER_40]: I really hope that you all will vote in support of this.

1649
02:31:21,007 --> 02:31:21,407
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

1650
02:31:30,550 --> 02:31:31,250
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1651
02:31:31,550 --> 02:31:32,991
[SPEAKER_60]: For the record, you have two minutes.

1652
02:31:33,031 --> 02:31:33,431
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1653
02:31:34,082 --> 02:31:35,743
[SPEAKER_46]: My name is Harlan from Somerville.

1654
02:31:35,823 --> 02:31:37,544
[SPEAKER_46]: I grew up in the area.

1655
02:31:37,564 --> 02:31:42,346
[SPEAKER_46]: I've been going to day things at Tufts all my life.

1656
02:31:42,446 --> 02:31:47,648
[SPEAKER_46]: And my mother and I have lived in Somerville with my brothers for over 50 years.

1657
02:31:48,229 --> 02:31:53,191
[SPEAKER_46]: And my mother had to flee when she was a child because of what was going on over there.

1658
02:31:53,371 --> 02:31:57,613
[SPEAKER_46]: And every time I go back to Palestine to visit, I get harassed.

1659
02:31:59,062 --> 02:32:09,848
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't care you know my American passport my father being an American army soldier and all my uncles on his side, I still get harassed four or five hours.

1660
02:32:10,409 --> 02:32:11,689
[SPEAKER_46]: One time I called my mother up.

1661
02:32:13,966 --> 02:32:16,608
[SPEAKER_46]: and said, mom, they're gonna put me on a plane.

1662
02:32:17,589 --> 02:32:20,871
[SPEAKER_46]: My mother was standing on the other side of the wall to get out of the airport.

1663
02:32:21,071 --> 02:32:22,652
[SPEAKER_46]: And I was like, mom, they're gonna put me on a plane.

1664
02:32:22,672 --> 02:32:24,234
[SPEAKER_46]: That's what I thought they were gonna do to me.

1665
02:32:24,634 --> 02:32:36,462
[SPEAKER_46]: And it's so scary to see when you go there to see the tear gas going off and having to run into a store in the neighborhood in Ramallah because somebody did something and I don't know what they did.

1666
02:32:37,423 --> 02:32:40,605
[SPEAKER_46]: Relatives have been arrested and imprisoned for years.

1667
02:32:41,105 --> 02:32:42,726
[SPEAKER_46]: But you know what the most important thing is?

1668
02:32:43,146 --> 02:32:45,927
[SPEAKER_46]: Even the poorest Palestinian, you go and visit.

1669
02:32:45,967 --> 02:32:50,509
[SPEAKER_46]: Like Claire was saying, Claire has come with me several times to Palestine.

1670
02:32:51,270 --> 02:32:56,252
[SPEAKER_46]: And they took her in and I thought she was more family than I was.

1671
02:32:56,852 --> 02:33:02,335
[SPEAKER_46]: That's how the Palestinians, they may not have water coming out of their faucet.

1672
02:33:03,134 --> 02:33:08,857
[SPEAKER_46]: But you know what, you'll have a nice bed to sleep in, and a male fit for a king and queen.

1673
02:33:09,437 --> 02:33:19,762
[SPEAKER_46]: So that's, I just want to say, I hope that you do like Somerville does and Cambridge does, and quick action, which was great, and vote for a resolution to cease fire now, free Palestine.

1674
02:33:19,922 --> 02:33:26,846
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1675
02:33:27,926 --> 02:33:31,068
[SPEAKER_37]: Your name and your city or your street address for the record, you have two minutes.

1676
02:33:31,465 --> 02:33:36,810
[SPEAKER_70]: My name is Emma, and I'm a resident of Somerville who went to university and then lived in Medford for eight years.

1677
02:33:37,391 --> 02:33:42,675
[SPEAKER_70]: I was a tough student who first majored in mechanical engineering before changing to engineering psychology.

1678
02:33:42,696 --> 02:33:46,980
[SPEAKER_70]: I would like to remind you all that in addition to what everybody else has said.

1679
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:57,483
[SPEAKER_70]: This resolution is relevant and important because there are scientists and engineers in our area, including those who work at Elbit Systems in nearby Cambridge, who work in support of Israel.

1680
02:33:58,143 --> 02:34:06,765
[SPEAKER_70]: It is our responsibility as American taxpayers and residents of the greater Boston area to take responsibility for our role in the genocide and call for a ceasefire.

1681
02:34:06,885 --> 02:34:07,265
[SPEAKER_70]: Thank you.

1682
02:34:07,285 --> 02:34:08,706
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

1683
02:34:14,252 --> 02:34:16,113
[SPEAKER_37]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium.

1684
02:34:16,313 --> 02:34:17,954
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, two minutes.

1685
02:34:18,675 --> 02:34:19,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I'm Karina.

1686
02:34:19,696 --> 02:34:24,519
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 34 William Street, Medford.

1687
02:34:24,539 --> 02:34:34,665
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to make sure that regardless of whether this resolution passes, those that decide to not vote or vote no,

1688
02:34:36,570 --> 02:34:43,274
[SPEAKER_16]: realize what side of history they are standing on, and that is the one that supports genocide.

1689
02:34:44,735 --> 02:34:53,381
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope that your consciences do not forgive you, and that the people of Medford, along with I, do not forgive you.

1690
02:34:53,421 --> 02:34:55,662
[SPEAKER_37]: I would just ask you to direct your comments to the chair.

1691
02:34:56,523 --> 02:34:57,724
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1692
02:34:58,284 --> 02:34:59,065
[SPEAKER_16]: The chair, also.

1693
02:34:59,605 --> 02:34:59,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1694
02:35:07,543 --> 02:35:08,764
[SPEAKER_37]: That's what I'm here for.

1695
02:35:09,766 --> 02:35:11,648
[SPEAKER_37]: Go to the podium, name and address for the record.

1696
02:35:11,668 --> 02:35:14,171
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes, and I will dispose this as my campaign treasure.

1697
02:35:14,639 --> 02:35:16,300
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, thank you for getting to that before I did.

1698
02:35:17,220 --> 02:35:21,903
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, my name is Gregory Zapata and I am, and I live at 16 Emory Street.

1699
02:35:23,204 --> 02:35:28,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening Council President Behrs, Vice President Collins, members of the Council, and everyone assembled.

1700
02:35:28,667 --> 02:35:33,950
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Gregory Zapata and I've had the great pleasure of living in Medford's Hillside neighborhood for much of the past 12 years.

1701
02:35:34,350 --> 02:35:37,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Two of those years were spent in Somerville, but I ask you to not hold that against me.

1702
02:35:38,132 --> 02:35:47,495
[SPEAKER_20]: I will keep my comments brief, as I know many more wish to speak on this very important matter, and it is a very important matter, even though Palestine is many, many miles away from where we all are.

1703
02:35:48,176 --> 02:35:56,219
[SPEAKER_20]: It matters because of the cruel offenses committed, relayed to our radios, phones, televisions, and newspapers on a daily basis, are committed on our tax dime.

1704
02:35:56,599 --> 02:36:05,422
[SPEAKER_20]: It matters because these acts of genocide are in violation, not just of international law, but also in violation of the moral codes by which we are taught to abide from when we were very small.

1705
02:36:06,062 --> 02:36:12,269
[SPEAKER_20]: Since the start of this conflict, many in this country and city have been motivated to take to the streets and to speak up for what they feel to be right.

1706
02:36:12,750 --> 02:36:22,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Sometimes they speak at the risk of their professional or even physical well-being, but they speak up all the same, and my admiration for them would be tempered by a sense of shame if I did not do likewise.

1707
02:36:23,502 --> 02:36:27,947
[SPEAKER_20]: speaking against the war in Vietnam, Martin Luther King said, there comes a time when silence becomes betrayal.

1708
02:36:28,327 --> 02:36:33,132
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I speak in favor of this resolution versus fire and applaud all those who have brought this to this critical moment.

1709
02:36:33,813 --> 02:36:40,921
[SPEAKER_20]: But while I support this resolution, those behind it, I also cannot ignore the argument of why we should concern ourselves with this Palestine is so far away.

1710
02:36:41,281 --> 02:36:42,602
[SPEAKER_20]: We have so many concerns here.

1711
02:36:42,622 --> 02:36:43,764
[SPEAKER_20]: 30 seconds.

1712
02:36:44,164 --> 02:36:46,505
[SPEAKER_20]: But the cause of Palestine is the cause of all those who are oppressed.

1713
02:36:46,545 --> 02:36:53,467
[SPEAKER_20]: And if, God forbid, the circumstances were flipped, we would want everyone in the world outside of Medford to speak up for our rights.

1714
02:36:53,788 --> 02:36:55,188
[SPEAKER_20]: And that would include the Palestinian people.

1715
02:36:55,568 --> 02:37:04,011
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I would ask everyone in this council to vote affirmative for the resolution and to bring a just and lasting peace to this region.

1716
02:37:04,211 --> 02:37:04,571
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1717
02:37:05,232 --> 02:37:05,632
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1718
02:37:11,527 --> 02:37:12,528
[SPEAKER_37]: We do have someone on Zoom.

1719
02:37:12,548 --> 02:37:14,268
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to go to them, and then I'll come right back to you.

1720
02:37:14,789 --> 02:37:16,229
[SPEAKER_37]: On Zoom, I have Sharon Diesso.

1721
02:37:16,710 --> 02:37:17,530
[SPEAKER_37]: I will unmute you, Sharon.

1722
02:37:17,550 --> 02:37:21,912
[SPEAKER_37]: You'll have two minutes, and I will give you a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.

1723
02:37:28,115 --> 02:37:28,516
[SPEAKER_37]: Sharon?

1724
02:37:34,059 --> 02:37:35,299
[SPEAKER_37]: Sharon, I'm going to come back to you.

1725
02:37:35,499 --> 02:37:36,340
[SPEAKER_37]: We'll go to the podium.

1726
02:37:37,300 --> 02:37:38,461
[SPEAKER_37]: Sharon can, okay, sorry.

1727
02:37:39,061 --> 02:37:40,582
[SPEAKER_37]: This hybrid gets a little rough.

1728
02:37:45,174 --> 02:37:46,394
[SPEAKER_37]: Sharon, I just unmuted you.

1729
02:37:46,414 --> 02:37:47,495
[SPEAKER_37]: Do you need to accept it?

1730
02:37:54,057 --> 02:37:55,497
[SPEAKER_37]: Thanks to everyone for bearing with me.

1731
02:38:01,259 --> 02:38:02,740
[SPEAKER_37]: Sharon, I'm going to have to come back to you.

1732
02:38:02,760 --> 02:38:03,940
[SPEAKER_37]: We'll go to the podium.

1733
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:06,461
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record.

1734
02:38:06,481 --> 02:38:07,081
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes.

1735
02:38:07,571 --> 02:38:09,833
[SPEAKER_68]: My name is Raviv and I live on Pinkham and Bedford.

1736
02:38:10,674 --> 02:38:16,519
[SPEAKER_68]: I'm here as a member of the Medford community and as the grandchild of people who fled violent antisemitism in their home countries.

1737
02:38:17,440 --> 02:38:22,885
[SPEAKER_68]: It is not my place to speak of the experiences of living under 75 years of violence and occupation.

1738
02:38:22,905 --> 02:38:28,190
[SPEAKER_68]: I urge you to hold those testimonies which have already been shared here today with the weight and compassion they are owed.

1739
02:38:28,891 --> 02:38:30,892
[SPEAKER_68]: I'm here because my Jewish values compel me.

1740
02:38:31,733 --> 02:38:40,185
[SPEAKER_68]: To suggest that opposing the genocide being exacted by the State of Israel is anti-Semitism is not only logically inconsistent, it is offensive and dangerous.

1741
02:38:41,026 --> 02:38:46,373
[SPEAKER_68]: Months ago, after the death of Massa Amini, Iranians took to the streets to condemn the Iranian government.

1742
02:38:47,194 --> 02:38:48,035
[SPEAKER_68]: as many in the U.S.

1743
02:38:48,115 --> 02:38:54,519
[SPEAKER_68]: joined in support of the rallying cries of women, life, freedom, they did so free from accusations of Islamophobia.

1744
02:38:55,199 --> 02:39:03,905
[SPEAKER_68]: And yet now, as we stand here calling for a ceasefire, we are met with accusations of anti-Semitism, of implications that ceasefire will jeopardize the safety of Jewish residents.

1745
02:39:04,585 --> 02:39:14,852
[SPEAKER_68]: I urge the city council to reconcile with the hypocrisy of these accusations, of accusing a Jewish city councilor and an overwhelming number of Jewish residents here today with anti-Semitism.

1746
02:39:15,552 --> 02:39:23,317
[SPEAKER_68]: To insinuate that supporting an end to violence will create division in our community, I challenge you to consider what version of unity and peace is being disrupted.

1747
02:39:23,897 --> 02:39:27,700
[SPEAKER_68]: For the Palestinian members of our community, that peace never existed to begin with.

1748
02:39:28,868 --> 02:39:40,494
[SPEAKER_68]: For non-Jews afraid of accusations of anti-Semitism, I stand before you as a representative of the millions of Jews here in the U.S., in Israel, and around the world who are supporting a ceasefire and an end to occupation.

1749
02:39:40,514 --> 02:39:47,077
[SPEAKER_68]: For those who support ceasefire, please know that the Jewish members in this chamber and around the world stand with you.

1750
02:39:51,974 --> 02:39:53,135
[SPEAKER_54]: and an end to occupation.

1751
02:39:53,235 --> 02:40:00,660
[SPEAKER_54]: For those who support ceasefire, please know the Jewish members in this chamber and around the world stand with you.

1752
02:40:01,560 --> 02:40:01,901
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1753
02:40:01,921 --> 02:40:06,143
[SPEAKER_37]: I see that you're unmuted and I will give you a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning.

1754
02:40:06,163 --> 02:40:07,084
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes.

1755
02:40:07,945 --> 02:40:08,525
[SPEAKER_77]: Thank you.

1756
02:40:10,106 --> 02:40:20,633
[SPEAKER_77]: Council President Behrs and I am speaking from my heart and from my head at this point.

1757
02:40:24,402 --> 02:40:32,848
[SPEAKER_77]: I feel that I have been around a lot longer than many of the council members and some of the people who are in the chamber this evening.

1758
02:40:33,508 --> 02:40:37,551
[SPEAKER_77]: I have seen wars, many wars, grand wars.

1759
02:40:39,812 --> 02:40:44,475
[SPEAKER_77]: Very luckily for Americans that they were on opposite sides of the world.

1760
02:40:45,419 --> 02:40:49,702
[SPEAKER_77]: My very dear friend, whom I grew up with, married an Israeli.

1761
02:40:49,782 --> 02:40:50,743
[SPEAKER_77]: She lives there now.

1762
02:40:50,883 --> 02:40:53,045
[SPEAKER_77]: She said it's absolutely horrible scene.

1763
02:40:54,186 --> 02:40:58,089
[SPEAKER_77]: She had a peaceful week, but she said, we don't know what will happen tomorrow.

1764
02:40:58,109 --> 02:41:07,476
[SPEAKER_77]: This war, internally, you must know, has been going on for centuries.

1765
02:41:09,597 --> 02:41:11,919
[SPEAKER_77]: I definitely commiserate.

1766
02:41:12,839 --> 02:41:21,306
[SPEAKER_77]: with anyone who is a victim of war, especially at this time in history, it's 2024.

1767
02:41:22,787 --> 02:41:25,889
[SPEAKER_77]: Some of these people are living back in ancient history.

1768
02:41:25,909 --> 02:41:33,275
[SPEAKER_77]: I haven't quite decided yet with my age, what is a real good resolution for any war?

1769
02:41:34,576 --> 02:41:36,538
[SPEAKER_77]: Israel has had ceasefire before.

1770
02:41:37,190 --> 02:41:39,591
[SPEAKER_77]: and still has been subject to bombings.

1771
02:41:42,091 --> 02:41:42,571
[SPEAKER_77]: Thank you.

1772
02:41:42,731 --> 02:41:54,314
[SPEAKER_77]: People are getting killed in Palestine, but only one person tonight, may I say, one person in not in exclusive terms mentioned the word Hamas.

1773
02:41:54,955 --> 02:41:58,215
[SPEAKER_77]: Israel is not at war with the Palestinian innocence.

1774
02:41:58,556 --> 02:41:59,956
[SPEAKER_77]: It is at war with Hamas.

1775
02:42:00,763 --> 02:42:04,665
[SPEAKER_77]: I believe, believe that part of this could be a ceasefire.

1776
02:42:04,685 --> 02:42:08,227
[SPEAKER_77]: There are grand talks going on right now, even as we speak.

1777
02:42:08,247 --> 02:42:12,189
[SPEAKER_77]: Palestine needs to ask Hamas to leave.

1778
02:42:13,650 --> 02:42:16,752
[SPEAKER_77]: Then the rest, I think, can very nicely fall in place.

1779
02:42:17,172 --> 02:42:18,453
[SPEAKER_77]: I respect all your wishes.

1780
02:42:18,853 --> 02:42:19,333
[SPEAKER_77]: Thank you.

1781
02:42:20,594 --> 02:42:20,994
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you.

1782
02:42:21,895 --> 02:42:23,876
[SPEAKER_55]: Palestine needs to ask Hamas

1783
02:42:26,957 --> 02:42:28,058
[SPEAKER_37]: Welcome to the podium.

1784
02:42:28,098 --> 02:42:29,079
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record.

1785
02:42:29,099 --> 02:42:29,679
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes.

1786
02:42:29,699 --> 02:42:31,581
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll give a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning.

1787
02:42:31,941 --> 02:42:33,242
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Elizabeth Henley.

1788
02:42:33,303 --> 02:42:35,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I live at 28 Princeton Street in Medford.

1789
02:42:36,145 --> 02:42:38,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to everyone who has already spoken.

1790
02:42:38,307 --> 02:42:42,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to the council for bringing this resolution forward.

1791
02:42:43,271 --> 02:42:48,215
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I have not heard explicitly said yet is that Israel has been

1792
02:42:49,076 --> 02:42:58,998
[SPEAKER_06]: indiscriminately bombing Gaza, where the hostages also are, that they are saying that they are worried about.

1793
02:42:59,058 --> 02:43:05,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I urge the council to not fall for a disingenuous distraction technique to try to delay the vote.

1794
02:43:06,699 --> 02:43:08,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Ceasefire and free Palestine.

1795
02:43:08,319 --> 02:43:08,819
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1796
02:43:15,721 --> 02:43:17,061
[SPEAKER_33]: Name and address for the record, please.

1797
02:43:18,046 --> 02:43:19,006
[SPEAKER_44]: Hello, everybody.

1798
02:43:19,046 --> 02:43:23,448
[SPEAKER_44]: My name is Sarah Halawa, and I live in Somerville at 43 Monroe Street.

1799
02:43:24,889 --> 02:43:36,895
[SPEAKER_44]: And I am here to speak to you about what it means to pass a ceasefire resolution to the Muslim community, to the Arab community, and to the Palestinian community in your town.

1800
02:43:38,315 --> 02:43:40,236
[SPEAKER_44]: I'll tell you a little bit about myself.

1801
02:43:40,296 --> 02:43:49,182
[SPEAKER_44]: My father was born to a large Jewish family and as a young man fell in love with Islam and converted and I was born and raised Muslim.

1802
02:43:49,562 --> 02:43:51,403
[SPEAKER_44]: He built the mosque in my town.

1803
02:43:51,563 --> 02:43:53,704
[SPEAKER_44]: He was a very devoted man to his faith.

1804
02:43:55,465 --> 02:44:02,310
[SPEAKER_44]: He has a testament that this is no religious war, and he would tell anybody who he ever met who would listen to him at length about that.

1805
02:44:02,770 --> 02:44:10,936
[SPEAKER_44]: My husband, his father was born in Nablus in the West Bank, and he was a teenager when the Israeli occupation began.

1806
02:44:11,056 --> 02:44:14,819
[SPEAKER_44]: They invaded the West Bank, Nablus, and the occupation began.

1807
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:24,568
[SPEAKER_44]: One night, he was awoken at gunpoint as 20 Israeli soldiers stormed his house, burst open the door, knocked down his parents.

1808
02:44:25,008 --> 02:44:31,795
[SPEAKER_44]: He was arrested and detained and tortured for three days in all of the ways that we are seeing today on our social media.

1809
02:44:32,115 --> 02:44:33,036
[SPEAKER_44]: He was stripped naked.

1810
02:44:33,176 --> 02:44:34,518
[SPEAKER_44]: He had dogs put on him.

1811
02:44:34,598 --> 02:44:35,679
[SPEAKER_44]: He was physically abused.

1812
02:44:35,719 --> 02:44:36,780
[SPEAKER_44]: He was deprived of food.

1813
02:44:37,180 --> 02:44:38,501
[SPEAKER_44]: water, warmth.

1814
02:44:39,102 --> 02:44:48,248
[SPEAKER_44]: And then when they were done, they released him under curfew that everybody in his city lives under, which meant that the Israeli soldiers who were patrolling could shoot on sight.

1815
02:44:48,628 --> 02:44:53,411
[SPEAKER_44]: When he asked them what he should do about this, they laughed at him and they said, this is your problem.

1816
02:44:53,692 --> 02:44:54,532
[SPEAKER_38]: Sorry, you have 30 seconds.

1817
02:44:54,572 --> 02:44:59,756
[SPEAKER_44]: He got home and his mother, they took all their money and they sent him to America where

1818
02:45:01,607 --> 02:45:03,689
[SPEAKER_44]: he saw his mother three more times in her life.

1819
02:45:04,009 --> 02:45:16,578
[SPEAKER_44]: Every single Palestinian you meet in your community has a direct story of violence from the state of Israel to themselves, their immediate family, of dehumanization, of diaspora, of ethnic cleansing, and apartheid.

1820
02:45:17,558 --> 02:45:20,560
[SPEAKER_44]: When we watched this genocide unfold, and we were

1821
02:45:22,982 --> 02:45:26,544
[SPEAKER_44]: we heard silence from the leaders of our immediate community.

1822
02:45:26,844 --> 02:45:28,726
[SPEAKER_44]: That felt like a punch in the gut.

1823
02:45:29,106 --> 02:45:33,609
[SPEAKER_44]: And the first day we were able to relax was when Somerville passed their ceasefire resolution.

1824
02:45:33,989 --> 02:45:36,170
[SPEAKER_44]: It really matters to Muslims.

1825
02:45:36,550 --> 02:45:38,612
[SPEAKER_44]: It is a statement that our lives matter.

1826
02:45:38,972 --> 02:45:39,352
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1827
02:45:39,532 --> 02:45:49,658
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Sarah.

1828
02:45:49,678 --> 02:45:50,639
[SPEAKER_37]: You have two minutes.

1829
02:45:51,098 --> 02:45:53,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, my name is Linnea Strassfeld.

1830
02:45:53,219 --> 02:45:54,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a junior at Medford High School.

1831
02:45:55,960 --> 02:46:08,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just like to say that for these past few months, I have, like many Jews and many Palestinians, I've been caught up in the current conflict and this acute sense of loss that many of our ethnicities have been experiencing.

1832
02:46:09,466 --> 02:46:17,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen the suffering of both of our peoples, and I've felt our grief, and I've seen the radical extremism on both sides.

1833
02:46:18,390 --> 02:46:19,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And for that,

1834
02:46:20,171 --> 02:46:31,509
[SPEAKER_08]: For the radical extremism that comes from my ethnicity, I would like to say that I abhor this, that they are the vast minority, and that I absolutely condemn it, as do all Jews and all Zionists that I know.

1835
02:46:31,529 --> 02:46:34,934
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may speak for my people, I would like to say that this...

1836
02:46:35,655 --> 02:46:49,966
[SPEAKER_08]: What this resolution, I believe, stands for is an ideal that we can all agree on, which is we want recognition of suffering, no matter what ethnicity that is enduring this.

1837
02:46:50,586 --> 02:46:54,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And we would like for both of our peoples, Jewish and Palestinian, to be whole again.

1838
02:46:55,189 --> 02:47:03,516
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would like the Council to recognize that from the speeches that we have heard today, many of them very heart-wrenching, that this will not be the outcome.

1839
02:47:04,116 --> 02:47:05,596
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not an ideal.

1840
02:47:05,616 --> 02:47:08,617
[SPEAKER_08]: This will not be interpreted as an ideal.

1841
02:47:08,637 --> 02:47:10,018
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a commitment.

1842
02:47:11,198 --> 02:47:12,598
[SPEAKER_08]: People will not read the full text.

1843
02:47:12,778 --> 02:47:14,639
[SPEAKER_08]: They will not see the mentions of the hostages.

1844
02:47:15,159 --> 02:47:17,040
[SPEAKER_08]: They will only see the word ceasefire.

1845
02:47:17,740 --> 02:47:19,520
[SPEAKER_08]: People will not interpret it as an ideal.

1846
02:47:19,960 --> 02:47:21,821
[SPEAKER_08]: They will see it as something very flat.

1847
02:47:22,381 --> 02:47:26,742
[SPEAKER_08]: And I personally would not like to be the reality of my community.

1848
02:47:27,843 --> 02:47:32,384
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I just may speak very briefly to the Jews in the room, I would just like to say that

1849
02:47:33,284 --> 02:47:35,946
[SPEAKER_08]: What is being done is not in any of our names.

1850
02:47:36,006 --> 02:47:45,954
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the names of Nama Levi, and Kfir Bidas, and Elia Cohen, and all of those people that are currently in Gaza, all of the Jews that are being held against their will in Gaza.

1851
02:47:46,294 --> 02:47:48,416
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's all I would like to say.

1852
02:47:48,436 --> 02:47:48,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1853
02:47:49,276 --> 02:47:49,897
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Linnea.

1854
02:47:50,617 --> 02:47:55,541
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

1855
02:47:56,201 --> 02:47:57,843
[SPEAKER_37]: Pao Mendez, I'll unmute you.

1856
02:47:57,863 --> 02:48:02,206
[SPEAKER_37]: You'll have two minutes, and I will give you a 30-second and a 10-second warning.

1857
02:48:04,585 --> 02:48:06,286
[SPEAKER_73]: Hello everyone, my name is Pao.

1858
02:48:06,606 --> 02:48:10,587
[SPEAKER_73]: I live in Somerville and I work as a hospice art therapist.

1859
02:48:11,367 --> 02:48:15,989
[SPEAKER_73]: Two of the participants that I work with are Muslim siblings, little, little kids.

1860
02:48:16,709 --> 02:48:21,671
[SPEAKER_73]: As much as their parents have tried to protect them, they're having to watch the horror unfold in front of them.

1861
02:48:22,631 --> 02:48:25,933
[SPEAKER_73]: In a recent visit, we were playing with toy construction trucks.

1862
02:48:26,633 --> 02:48:32,575
[SPEAKER_73]: The seven-year-old said that we were going to pretend to be heroes and use our shovel to dig bodies out of the ground.

1863
02:48:33,871 --> 02:48:37,912
[SPEAKER_73]: I don't want to live in a world where children have to view and live in fear of violence.

1864
02:48:38,812 --> 02:48:45,574
[SPEAKER_73]: I wish I could show you all the way that their faces lit up when I showed up to our most recent visit wearing a pin of the Palestinian flag.

1865
02:48:46,755 --> 02:48:56,177
[SPEAKER_73]: We can create a better world for the kids in our communities and intervene to prevent as much harm as possible from the collective trauma being inflicted on our youth.

1866
02:48:56,917 --> 02:49:02,399
[SPEAKER_73]: You can play a role in that today in Medford by voting in favor of a ceasefire resolution.

1867
02:49:02,419 --> 02:49:03,219
[SPEAKER_73]: Thank you.

1868
02:49:06,141 --> 02:49:06,421
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1869
02:49:06,501 --> 02:49:14,243
[SPEAKER_37]: And I also wanna thank you for answering me in the chat and respecting our cybersecurity.

1870
02:49:16,264 --> 02:49:18,104
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, two minutes.

1871
02:49:18,464 --> 02:49:20,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Christine and I live in Medford.

1872
02:49:20,965 --> 02:49:22,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't come prepared to say anything.

1873
02:49:22,485 --> 02:49:24,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just gonna speak quickly from the heart.

1874
02:49:24,886 --> 02:49:28,367
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a bachelor's degree in public health and I currently work in the healthcare field.

1875
02:49:28,967 --> 02:49:33,748
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanna say that the genocide in Gaza is absolutely a public health issue and concern.

1876
02:49:34,528 --> 02:49:39,232
[SPEAKER_09]: We should pass a ceasefire now so that the folks in Gaza can get the care that they need.

1877
02:49:39,872 --> 02:49:56,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm tired of seeing videos of people, premature babies being born without an ICU, without incubation, women giving birth and having C-sections without anesthesia, and people having their limbs taken off without anesthesia.

1878
02:49:56,426 --> 02:49:59,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Just imagine that for a moment, the pain that the people are feeling in Palestine.

1879
02:50:01,550 --> 02:50:02,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, that's all I had to say.

1880
02:50:02,571 --> 02:50:03,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Just ceasefire now and free Palestine.

1881
02:50:11,852 --> 02:50:12,352
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1882
02:50:12,592 --> 02:50:18,914
[SPEAKER_37]: If there's anyone out, I'm just going to say to anyone left on Zoom, if you would like to speak, please raise your hand, and I will go to the podium.

1883
02:50:19,274 --> 02:50:21,075
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, and you have two minutes.

1884
02:50:21,095 --> 02:50:22,855
[SPEAKER_66]: As-salamu alaykum.

1885
02:50:24,036 --> 02:50:34,859
[SPEAKER_66]: My name is Fawaz Abu-Shariq for Harrison Road, and I'm here on behalf of the Palestinian House, New England, Boston Coalition for Palestine, and North Shore for Palestine.

1886
02:50:36,041 --> 02:50:46,826
[SPEAKER_66]: I was shocked to hear through you, Mr. President, when the good counselor spoke about his friends, Palestinian, and then he ended up with two Zionist letters.

1887
02:50:47,426 --> 02:50:48,086
[SPEAKER_66]: Not Jewish.

1888
02:50:48,426 --> 02:50:49,347
[SPEAKER_66]: We have to be careful.

1889
02:50:50,147 --> 02:50:50,787
[SPEAKER_66]: Zionist.

1890
02:50:51,548 --> 02:50:53,548
[SPEAKER_66]: And it's not Jewish, it's not Judaism.

1891
02:50:54,389 --> 02:50:56,670
[SPEAKER_66]: And mentioning all his Palestinian friends,

1892
02:50:58,258 --> 02:50:58,698
[SPEAKER_32]: Excuse me.

1893
02:50:58,898 --> 02:51:00,540
[SPEAKER_32]: Personal privilege.

1894
02:51:01,521 --> 02:51:07,928
[SPEAKER_32]: My comments that were, like I stated, these were residents that asked me to read things on the record.

1895
02:51:07,948 --> 02:51:12,112
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, this is, don't divert what was said.

1896
02:51:12,633 --> 02:51:16,197
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what I wanted to just make sure that that was stated.

1897
02:51:16,457 --> 02:51:17,078
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1898
02:51:17,438 --> 02:51:18,079
[SPEAKER_37]: You may continue.

1899
02:51:18,894 --> 02:51:28,041
[SPEAKER_66]: Okay, and I was expecting a letter from a Palestinian or something, but nothing, because we are right.

1900
02:51:28,061 --> 02:51:32,225
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. President, I would really ask that we not engage in direct debate with each other here.

1901
02:51:32,813 --> 02:51:36,795
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not for every Palestinian that I talked to would have great discussion.

1902
02:51:37,195 --> 02:51:38,676
[SPEAKER_32]: I offered the same advice.

1903
02:51:39,016 --> 02:51:41,337
[SPEAKER_32]: And I offered the same chance to read.

1904
02:51:41,717 --> 02:51:42,718
[SPEAKER_32]: It just wasn't sent.

1905
02:51:42,918 --> 02:51:43,618
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1906
02:51:43,658 --> 02:51:45,699
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Councilor.

1907
02:51:45,759 --> 02:51:48,781
[SPEAKER_66]: He has to direct you just like I am directing you.

1908
02:51:49,181 --> 02:51:53,403
[SPEAKER_66]: Yes, please do not look at me and do not point at me when you speak Mr. Councilor.

1909
02:51:54,585 --> 02:51:55,205
[SPEAKER_66]: You may continue.

1910
02:51:55,225 --> 02:51:59,306
[SPEAKER_66]: Thank you, Chair, because we have to go with the rules.

1911
02:51:59,846 --> 02:52:09,689
[SPEAKER_66]: Anyways, no Palestinians, and this is why we say white lives matter.

1912
02:52:09,709 --> 02:52:18,251
[SPEAKER_66]: A couple of days ago, I saw a sign that said, what would have you done at the Holocaust time in Nazi Germany?

1913
02:52:19,331 --> 02:52:22,472
[SPEAKER_66]: And the answer to that is, you are doing it now.

1914
02:52:23,948 --> 02:52:32,113
[SPEAKER_66]: This is exactly what you will be doing if you're going to stop the killing and the murder, or you're just going to try to find excuses.

1915
02:52:32,433 --> 02:52:34,154
[SPEAKER_66]: And this is not directed at anybody.

1916
02:52:34,174 --> 02:52:36,716
[SPEAKER_37]: 30 seconds.

1917
02:52:38,136 --> 02:52:42,359
[SPEAKER_66]: If anybody is coming here thinking he's getting a victory, there isn't one to be had.

1918
02:52:43,780 --> 02:52:49,343
[SPEAKER_66]: Nobody is coming back from the tens of thousands injured, destruction.

1919
02:52:49,623 --> 02:52:51,805
[SPEAKER_66]: A whole city is sitting on the border.

1920
02:52:52,816 --> 02:52:59,238
[SPEAKER_66]: We are just simply telling them, we feel you, we love you, we want you, we support you.

1921
02:52:59,578 --> 02:53:02,539
[SPEAKER_66]: This resolution is not gonna do anything, zero.

1922
02:53:02,859 --> 02:53:17,164
[SPEAKER_66]: We're just going to our leaders to tell them, please stop the carnage, stop the killing, cease fire now, free Palestine, and let's work on a solution for today forever.

1923
02:53:17,444 --> 02:53:17,964
[SPEAKER_66]: Thank you.

1924
02:53:32,717 --> 02:53:34,238
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Humayun Morshid.

1925
02:53:34,858 --> 02:53:35,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I live in 30 St.

1926
02:53:36,018 --> 02:53:37,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Francis Street, Medford.

1927
02:53:38,199 --> 02:53:42,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the community organizer and also I represent Islamic Cultural Center of Medford.

1928
02:53:43,080 --> 02:53:48,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Just want to say thank you, Councilor Collins, take the resolution to the council.

1929
02:53:48,722 --> 02:53:53,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope everybody already spoke, so I think I'll be the last one.

1930
02:53:53,503 --> 02:53:58,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to, on behalf of Muslim community in Medford, just want to say thank you and cease fire now.

1931
02:53:59,125 --> 02:54:01,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, appreciate it.

1932
02:54:01,086 --> 02:54:01,406
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

1933
02:54:03,157 --> 02:54:07,920
[SPEAKER_60]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak at the podium, or anyone else on Zoom who would like to speak?

1934
02:54:09,101 --> 02:54:11,143
[SPEAKER_37]: Are you speaking, Mr. Castanedi?

1935
02:54:12,624 --> 02:54:14,545
[SPEAKER_37]: I will allow you as I have allowed us all.

1936
02:54:15,666 --> 02:54:16,866
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyone else is welcome as well.

1937
02:54:16,886 --> 02:54:17,867
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of people here.

1938
02:54:17,887 --> 02:54:19,808
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel like I'm at a ballgame.

1939
02:54:19,828 --> 02:54:26,233
[SPEAKER_37]: Hey, you'll have two minutes, Mr. Castanedi, and I will give you a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.

1940
02:54:28,015 --> 02:54:30,396
[SPEAKER_22]: I canceled most of everything I was gonna say.

1941
02:54:31,436 --> 02:54:33,997
[SPEAKER_22]: Hearing these poor people, I feel horrible.

1942
02:54:36,838 --> 02:54:50,841
[SPEAKER_22]: As some of you know, I've always been a peaceful person since I went to Woodstock in 1969 and protested the lousy, undeclared war that cost us 60,000 soldiers dead, 10 times that, 600,000 wounded.

1943
02:54:57,711 --> 02:55:05,957
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of my friends in body bags, some are still around with PTSD, missing an arm and a leg, living in Medford right now.

1944
02:55:06,977 --> 02:55:08,098
[SPEAKER_22]: War is hell.

1945
02:55:08,598 --> 02:55:11,100
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, it's worse than hell.

1946
02:55:13,882 --> 02:55:21,247
[SPEAKER_22]: And we also protested the mandatory draft, which might happen real soon in this neighborhood, again.

1947
02:55:22,408 --> 02:55:26,411
[SPEAKER_22]: Just like Israel's had a draft for male and female, or she's, whatever.

1948
02:55:27,483 --> 02:55:30,426
[SPEAKER_22]: They've had it all these years since before I was born.

1949
02:55:32,307 --> 02:55:40,034
[SPEAKER_22]: This war is a total mess, and the world is one bomb away from World War III.

1950
02:55:42,976 --> 02:55:46,480
[SPEAKER_22]: May I say a God's heavenly prayer for all, please?

1951
02:55:47,681 --> 02:55:48,802
[SPEAKER_22]: Really, you'll let me?

1952
02:55:48,822 --> 02:55:50,243
[SPEAKER_37]: It's your time, you have 40 seconds.

1953
02:55:51,974 --> 02:55:55,456
[SPEAKER_22]: because before I heard some rebuttal that you didn't like the prayers.

1954
02:55:56,216 --> 02:56:11,383
[SPEAKER_22]: Almighty God, creator of heaven, earth, all sentient beings and more, please get me and all of us to be and do the best that we can, now, always, forever and ever, in our quest for eternal, blissful peace.

1955
02:56:11,963 --> 02:56:12,243
[SPEAKER_22]: Amen.

1956
02:56:14,584 --> 02:56:16,045
[SPEAKER_38]: You have 10 seconds.

1957
02:56:16,205 --> 02:56:20,627
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of us might swear there ain't no heaven, but we all better pray there ain't no hell.

1958
02:56:22,452 --> 02:56:23,433
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Mr. Cassinetti.

1959
02:56:31,059 --> 02:56:36,023
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak on this resolution, paper 24-035?

1960
02:56:36,663 --> 02:56:37,944
[SPEAKER_37]: We have a hand raised on Zoom.

1961
02:56:39,245 --> 02:56:41,147
[SPEAKER_37]: I will go to Matthew Page Lieberman.

1962
02:56:42,468 --> 02:56:48,232
[SPEAKER_37]: You will have two minutes, and I will give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.

1963
02:56:49,293 --> 02:56:50,514
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

1964
02:56:51,127 --> 02:56:54,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm Matthew Paige Lieberman I live at 15 Canal Street here in Medford.

1965
02:56:56,012 --> 02:57:06,602
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to start by saying that I extremely appreciate what has been brought before us that we can all really kind of consider about our contribution to this world and what kind of roles we want to play.

1966
02:57:07,342 --> 02:57:21,064
[SPEAKER_14]: I completely appreciate that Councillor Collins also acknowledged the humanity of everyone and did not do any apology whatsoever for any of the sociopathic massacres that we've seen over the past few months.

1967
02:57:23,125 --> 02:57:28,566
[SPEAKER_14]: I am a, like many people before me, I am a descendant of the Holocaust survivors.

1968
02:57:28,906 --> 02:57:30,106
[SPEAKER_14]: My grandfather made it out.

1969
02:57:30,746 --> 02:57:33,006
[SPEAKER_14]: All of his brothers and sisters were killed by the Nazis.

1970
02:57:33,787 --> 02:57:35,027
[SPEAKER_14]: There is an expression that

1971
02:57:36,889 --> 02:57:38,870
[SPEAKER_14]: For Jews, all of us are survivors.

1972
02:57:39,111 --> 02:57:44,714
[SPEAKER_14]: We're all survivors because the Nazis wanted to take our seed from this planet.

1973
02:57:46,356 --> 02:57:55,382
[SPEAKER_14]: And for me, that puts a particular impact with me, in which recently, the International Criminal Court

1974
02:57:56,823 --> 02:57:59,865
[SPEAKER_14]: was not able to determine yet if it is a genocide.

1975
02:58:00,426 --> 02:58:07,010
[SPEAKER_14]: But they are kind of taking a little they say it will take them a few years to make that determination completely.

1976
02:58:07,290 --> 02:58:14,636
[SPEAKER_14]: However, they have told Israel to take all steps necessary to ensure that it's not committing a genocide.

1977
02:58:14,676 --> 02:58:17,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Now Netanyahu's regime has decided to completely ignore that.

1978
02:58:18,803 --> 02:58:19,823
[SPEAKER_14]: completely ignore that.

1979
02:58:20,443 --> 02:58:38,769
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to honor all the people that are suffering from this in Palestine and in Israel, and I especially want to honor the family members of the hostages who have pled with the Israeli regime to care about the hostages, yet Israel, Netanyahu's regime prefers to butcher people.

1980
02:58:39,639 --> 02:58:40,420
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a fact.

1981
02:58:40,840 --> 02:58:48,406
[SPEAKER_14]: The family members of hostages, they broke into a commerce meeting, and they said, please take care of our hostages.

1982
02:58:48,426 --> 02:58:49,747
[SPEAKER_37]: You have 10 seconds, Matt.

1983
02:58:52,349 --> 02:58:58,655
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just end by saying none of us are made safer by thousands of people being massacred constantly.

1984
02:58:58,875 --> 02:59:01,157
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need to really cut it out with that nonsense.

1985
02:59:01,337 --> 02:59:01,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1986
02:59:02,778 --> 02:59:03,178
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1987
02:59:10,782 --> 02:59:11,062
[SPEAKER_37]: I did.

1988
02:59:13,123 --> 02:59:14,264
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm now going back on what I said.

1989
02:59:14,284 --> 02:59:17,626
[SPEAKER_37]: I said people could only speak once earlier procedural question.

1990
02:59:17,666 --> 02:59:19,047
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not going to procedural question.

1991
02:59:19,087 --> 02:59:19,547
[SPEAKER_37]: Absolutely.

1992
02:59:19,847 --> 02:59:26,711
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm wondering if the council would consider us votes on the original resolution and the vote on the amended resolution separately.

1993
02:59:27,671 --> 02:59:31,513
[SPEAKER_37]: I will leave that to counselors to make procedural motions as I can't.

1994
02:59:32,214 --> 02:59:37,257
[SPEAKER_37]: I do want to say before I turn back to counselors that I want to thank everyone.

1995
02:59:38,717 --> 02:59:39,238
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a

1996
02:59:40,373 --> 02:59:45,514
[SPEAKER_37]: This can be, I've run some tough meetings, and this actually wasn't one of them.

1997
02:59:45,994 --> 02:59:58,618
[SPEAKER_37]: And I really appreciate everyone, regardless of what they believed and what they felt, for just respecting everyone's time and their chance to tell their stories, because there's some incredibly powerful stories told tonight.

1998
02:59:59,518 --> 03:00:02,299
[SPEAKER_37]: I have told folks, I'm supportive of this resolution as amended.

1999
03:00:02,319 --> 03:00:07,560
[SPEAKER_37]: That's all I'm gonna say from the chair, because I really probably shouldn't have even have said that, but I really wanna thank

2000
03:00:08,380 --> 03:00:18,364
[SPEAKER_37]: all of you for your time, for your words, and for just, you're creating a respectful space for the people who ask to be heard to be heard.

2001
03:00:18,384 --> 03:00:18,404
[SPEAKER_37]: 95-99%.

2002
03:00:19,544 --> 03:00:19,984
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2003
03:00:20,104 --> 03:00:31,749
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Collins, and then Councilor Sang, and then Councilor Callahan.

2004
03:00:31,789 --> 03:00:32,549
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Collins.

2005
03:00:33,689 --> 03:00:34,470
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, President Beers.

2006
03:00:35,560 --> 03:00:36,421
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you to everybody who spoke.

2007
03:00:37,961 --> 03:00:44,045
[SPEAKER_65]: I already made the motion to adopt the new language and move forward with that new language.

2008
03:00:44,485 --> 03:00:46,586
[SPEAKER_65]: Motion to adopt, yeah, that's what I said.

2009
03:00:46,606 --> 03:00:52,029
[SPEAKER_65]: And I'll now motion to amend and adopt the new language.

2010
03:00:53,090 --> 03:00:53,350
[SPEAKER_65]: Got it.

2011
03:00:54,111 --> 03:00:56,252
[SPEAKER_65]: I hear everybody.

2012
03:00:56,272 --> 03:00:57,092
[SPEAKER_65]: I hear all of you.

2013
03:01:00,555 --> 03:01:04,198
[SPEAKER_65]: I don't know if it's possible for everybody to be heard equally, but I hear you.

2014
03:01:05,379 --> 03:01:07,921
[SPEAKER_65]: And I motion for approval of the resolution as amended.

2015
03:01:09,082 --> 03:01:13,566
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Khan seconded by second seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

2016
03:01:13,586 --> 03:01:16,509
[SPEAKER_37]: I will go to Councilor Sang and then Councilor Kelly and Councilor Sang.

2017
03:01:16,886 --> 03:01:17,266
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2018
03:01:17,286 --> 03:01:24,709
[SPEAKER_28]: I wanted to thank everyone who spoke, no matter what viewpoint of this resolution they have.

2019
03:01:25,630 --> 03:01:31,272
[SPEAKER_28]: It really means a lot to our city and our democracy that you're willing to take time out of your evening to do this.

2020
03:01:31,993 --> 03:01:44,118
[SPEAKER_28]: In that spirit, we also owe you, at least in my opinion, I owe you your faith, and me as your city councilor, to let you know that I care.

2021
03:01:44,438 --> 03:01:45,379
[SPEAKER_28]: I care about the stories.

2022
03:01:46,639 --> 03:01:55,081
[SPEAKER_28]: I know that many of you, as you've said tonight, have family who've been in the area, who are currently still in the area, who are trapped there, who are suffering.

2023
03:01:55,721 --> 03:02:10,124
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think this is a moment where people need to know that their local electeds care, that they not only hear them, but they, I think, deeply, deeply, that this deeply matters to them.

2024
03:02:12,979 --> 03:02:26,335
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think it's wrong at all to say that the context is complex, that there's misinformation, and there's violence and tragedy that civilians take the brunt of.

2025
03:02:26,856 --> 03:02:29,379
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think it's wrong to say that

2026
03:02:32,282 --> 03:02:37,186
[SPEAKER_28]: a lot of the rhetoric in the debate has been challenging for others to hear.

2027
03:02:37,987 --> 03:02:49,496
[SPEAKER_28]: But I have to thank you as a councillor that you've kept this conversation, this discourse tonight so cordial, so respectful, that you've followed the rules that the council president has set out.

2028
03:02:51,317 --> 03:03:01,307
[SPEAKER_28]: But you know, even given this, the complex history and context behind this issue, I think the question before us, the heart of this resolution is simple.

2029
03:03:02,128 --> 03:03:11,938
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think the big question is, do we affirm the sanctity, the preciousness, and the equality of all human life?

2030
03:03:12,478 --> 03:03:13,019
[SPEAKER_28]: And do we

2031
03:03:14,389 --> 03:03:15,870
[SPEAKER_28]: condemn the bloodshed going on.

2032
03:03:16,491 --> 03:03:19,733
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's not wrong to say that war begets war.

2033
03:03:20,093 --> 03:03:33,584
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think we should listen to the hostages' pleas to the Israeli government, that their government not do anything that worsens the outcome of people living in Israel and Palestine, of the civilians.

2034
03:03:33,804 --> 03:03:38,688
[SPEAKER_28]: And their pleas not to drive more people into extremism.

2035
03:03:40,849 --> 03:03:45,493
[SPEAKER_28]: I was struck by the word precedent earlier in public comment.

2036
03:03:46,634 --> 03:03:56,804
[SPEAKER_28]: Because even though we can't, as a city council, we can't stop what's going on from becoming precedent, I think we can stop normalizing it.

2037
03:03:57,853 --> 03:04:03,640
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think we have a moral duty to stop normalizing violence.

2038
03:04:04,061 --> 03:04:06,644
[SPEAKER_28]: We have to speak out against it, even if we can't stop it.

2039
03:04:07,525 --> 03:04:12,371
[SPEAKER_28]: On the issue of precedence, you know,

2040
03:04:13,692 --> 03:04:16,753
[SPEAKER_28]: thought during the debate about my own family.

2041
03:04:17,673 --> 03:04:21,434
[SPEAKER_28]: For those of you who don't know, my family comes from Taiwan.

2042
03:04:22,294 --> 03:04:24,654
[SPEAKER_28]: Pretty much everyone in my family lives in Taiwan.

2043
03:04:24,954 --> 03:04:29,956
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you've been following the news, we talk about war, the possibility of war every day in Taiwan.

2044
03:04:30,636 --> 03:04:36,017
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think about if this were happening over there right now,

2045
03:04:37,236 --> 03:04:41,659
[SPEAKER_28]: Number one, if we set this precedent, what that would mean for my family.

2046
03:04:42,299 --> 03:04:51,444
[SPEAKER_28]: I also think about what it would mean to me if I were watching and my community didn't support my family and didn't hear my family.

2047
03:04:52,205 --> 03:04:57,568
[SPEAKER_28]: And while Taiwan is a hypothetical for me, it's emotionally close to me, Palestine is now.

2048
03:04:58,168 --> 03:05:01,791
[SPEAKER_28]: And Palestine is now for so many of our community.

2049
03:05:03,004 --> 03:05:04,806
[SPEAKER_28]: This resolution I think is measured.

2050
03:05:05,326 --> 03:05:06,867
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's reasonable.

2051
03:05:07,207 --> 03:05:08,829
[SPEAKER_28]: I think, yes, it is ideal.

2052
03:05:09,209 --> 03:05:10,830
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it is nuanced.

2053
03:05:11,411 --> 03:05:15,694
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it speaks to the complexities on the ground.

2054
03:05:16,355 --> 03:05:17,796
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it condemns terrorism.

2055
03:05:18,016 --> 03:05:19,277
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it condemns Hamas.

2056
03:05:20,038 --> 03:05:22,860
[SPEAKER_28]: But I think it supports life.

2057
03:05:23,461 --> 03:05:24,682
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it uplifts life.

2058
03:05:25,222 --> 03:05:25,462
[SPEAKER_28]: I think

2059
03:05:26,704 --> 03:05:34,749
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a moral duty to say to our residents, no matter if you're Arab, Muslim, Jewish, Israeli-American, right?

2060
03:05:35,810 --> 03:05:37,031
[SPEAKER_28]: You belong in our community.

2061
03:05:37,051 --> 03:05:38,192
[SPEAKER_28]: You deserve to be heard.

2062
03:05:39,392 --> 03:05:43,355
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's why I'll plan to vote yes on this tonight.

2063
03:05:44,776 --> 03:05:48,218
[SPEAKER_28]: And I know there are a lot of folks at home watching who

2064
03:05:50,792 --> 03:05:57,055
[SPEAKER_28]: are just getting into activism, there are small steps that we can all take to help.

2065
03:05:57,155 --> 03:06:00,577
[SPEAKER_28]: While this is symbolic, donating an eSIM is not.

2066
03:06:01,357 --> 03:06:07,540
[SPEAKER_28]: Helping people in Gaza stay connected for just up to $5 a month is not symbolic.

2067
03:06:07,820 --> 03:06:19,205
[SPEAKER_28]: These are actions that we can take to help people on the ground, to stay connected to the world, and donations to human rights organizations, relief organizations, will really help people on the ground.

2068
03:06:23,083 --> 03:06:23,523
[SPEAKER_59]: Councilor, go ahead.

2069
03:06:31,067 --> 03:06:31,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2070
03:06:32,048 --> 03:06:35,710
[SPEAKER_19]: I so appreciate everyone who is involved in this process.

2071
03:06:35,770 --> 03:06:43,754
[SPEAKER_19]: And I want to say, just for a moment, about the amended language, that that is actually part of the democratic process.

2072
03:06:43,874 --> 03:06:49,898
[SPEAKER_19]: So the original language that was posted was there for people to interact with.

2073
03:06:50,478 --> 03:06:52,319
[SPEAKER_19]: That is why it was there, right?

2074
03:06:52,359 --> 03:06:56,880
[SPEAKER_19]: It wasn't there to remain untouched until we arrived here today.

2075
03:06:57,340 --> 03:07:01,041
[SPEAKER_19]: It was there so that people could be involved in democracy.

2076
03:07:01,101 --> 03:07:03,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I'll direct my comments to the chair.

2077
03:07:03,822 --> 03:07:06,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Could be involved in democracy and they did, right?

2078
03:07:06,963 --> 03:07:11,644
[SPEAKER_19]: They reached out to Councilor Collins and probably to, I certainly had someone reach out to me.

2079
03:07:12,364 --> 03:07:18,866
[SPEAKER_19]: People reached out to the councilors and to the sponsor of this particular resolution.

2080
03:07:19,426 --> 03:07:24,348
[SPEAKER_19]: to state what they wanted, their vision of what they wanted this to be.

2081
03:07:24,688 --> 03:07:27,009
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that many, many people did that.

2082
03:07:27,069 --> 03:07:29,690
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's where the amended language came from.

2083
03:07:30,170 --> 03:07:41,275
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't want people to think that we are simply looking at amended language that sprung out of one of our minds without input, and that we're voting on it without

2084
03:07:41,755 --> 03:07:42,696
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, thinking about it.

2085
03:07:42,956 --> 03:07:46,379
[SPEAKER_19]: But this was something that really was worked on by many people.

2086
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:48,622
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate all of their time.

2087
03:07:48,702 --> 03:07:52,085
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate all of the time of everyone who has been here.

2088
03:07:52,105 --> 03:07:58,191
[SPEAKER_19]: It is well worth our staying up late for the things that we do.

2089
03:07:59,372 --> 03:08:03,456
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really appreciate that and just wanted to chat for a minute about

2090
03:08:05,137 --> 03:08:08,318
[SPEAKER_19]: how much I appreciate people being involved in our democracy.

2091
03:08:08,358 --> 03:08:21,904
[SPEAKER_19]: I do hope that folks will come back and will stay on top of the things that are coming up in the city council and will reach out to us before they're voted on to help us make them better.

2092
03:08:23,685 --> 03:08:24,525
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

2093
03:08:29,287 --> 03:08:30,268
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further discussion?

2094
03:08:30,408 --> 03:08:31,348
[SPEAKER_37]: There's a motion on the floor.

2095
03:08:31,528 --> 03:08:32,729
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further motions or discussion?

2096
03:08:35,902 --> 03:08:40,125
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve as amended, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

2097
03:08:40,965 --> 03:08:43,747
[SPEAKER_37]: I could call a voice vote or a roll call, is there a preference?

2098
03:08:45,228 --> 03:08:46,509
[SPEAKER_37]: A roll call has been requested.

2099
03:08:46,549 --> 03:08:47,570
[SPEAKER_37]: There'll be a roll call vote.

2100
03:08:47,970 --> 03:08:49,171
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2101
03:08:50,052 --> 03:08:50,632
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor Calderon.

2102
03:08:50,932 --> 03:08:51,112
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes.

2103
03:08:52,393 --> 03:08:53,214
[SPEAKER_58]: Vice President Collins.

2104
03:08:53,474 --> 03:08:53,674
Yes.

2105
03:08:55,735 --> 03:08:56,536
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor Lazaro.

2106
03:08:56,876 --> 03:08:57,156
[SPEAKER_53]: Yes.

2107
03:08:58,757 --> 03:08:59,198
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor Lemming.

2108
03:08:59,218 --> 03:08:59,338
[SPEAKER_58]: No.

2109
03:09:02,560 --> 03:09:03,360
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2110
03:09:03,601 --> 03:09:03,701
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

2111
03:09:07,039 --> 03:09:07,599
[SPEAKER_58]: Councilor Sang?

2112
03:09:07,779 --> 03:09:07,979
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

2113
03:09:09,420 --> 03:09:10,160
[SPEAKER_58]: President Paris?

2114
03:09:10,961 --> 03:09:13,782
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, on a vote of five.

2115
03:09:18,464 --> 03:09:27,027
[SPEAKER_59]: Motion for a five minute recess.

2116
03:09:27,047 --> 03:09:31,309
[SPEAKER_59]: Motion for a five minute recess, seconded by Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

2117
03:09:32,310 --> 03:09:33,430
[SPEAKER_59]: All opposed?

2118
03:09:33,850 --> 03:09:35,251
[SPEAKER_59]: Motion passes, we're in recess.

2119
03:28:15,876 --> 03:28:17,138
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't have to ask you to vote for it.

2120
03:28:17,178 --> 03:28:18,659
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm calling us back into session.

2121
03:28:18,679 --> 03:28:29,908
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Lizardo, revert to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

2122
03:28:29,928 --> 03:28:32,070
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

2123
03:28:32,691 --> 03:28:33,151
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

2124
03:28:33,211 --> 03:28:34,172
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

2125
03:28:34,192 --> 03:28:34,212
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-022.

2126
03:28:42,162 --> 03:28:59,553
[SPEAKER_37]: beaten by my own agenda format, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold biannual trainings refreshers with Medford Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Frances Nwaje, or her designee, so that our body may keep these values top of mind in all our work and interactions with the public, Councilor Lazaro.

2127
03:28:59,813 --> 03:29:06,217
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, I had a meeting with Frances Nwaje.

2128
03:29:06,517 --> 03:29:10,079
[SPEAKER_42]: Can we make an amendment to this that says designee?

2129
03:29:10,159 --> 03:29:10,399
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

2130
03:29:10,499 --> 03:29:11,300
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2131
03:29:12,961 --> 03:29:15,683
[SPEAKER_42]: This is Paige.

2132
03:29:16,283 --> 03:29:16,803
[SPEAKER_42]: She's lovely.

2133
03:29:16,823 --> 03:29:18,584
[SPEAKER_42]: It was a really great conversation.

2134
03:29:18,604 --> 03:29:20,165
[SPEAKER_42]: I just think it would be...

2135
03:29:22,842 --> 03:29:39,988
[SPEAKER_42]: an absolute sort of bare minimum, one hour, twice a year, where we have a refresher, just maybe anything that might've come up in our interactions that could be something that we would be thinking about as a body.

2136
03:29:40,008 --> 03:29:47,170
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm curious about what it would take for us to meet, to convene.

2137
03:29:47,370 --> 03:29:51,672
[SPEAKER_42]: Would we be able to do it with open meeting laws being as they are?

2138
03:29:52,572 --> 03:29:54,033
[SPEAKER_42]: Would we have to do it in an open meeting?

2139
03:29:54,633 --> 03:29:56,114
[SPEAKER_42]: Or would we be able to do a training?

2140
03:29:56,134 --> 03:29:57,495
[SPEAKER_42]: So we would have to do a training here?

2141
03:29:57,795 --> 03:30:01,598
[SPEAKER_37]: We would have to do a training committee of the whole, if we wanted all counselors to be part of it.

2142
03:30:02,198 --> 03:30:04,800
[SPEAKER_37]: Or we could do trainings in smaller groups.

2143
03:30:05,160 --> 03:30:06,941
[SPEAKER_42]: We could do smaller groups separate.

2144
03:30:08,182 --> 03:30:12,905
[SPEAKER_37]: Could we do... There may be exemptions to the open meeting law, we'll have to look into it.

2145
03:30:13,624 --> 03:30:17,067
[SPEAKER_42]: I would be curious to hear about exemptions to open meeting law for that purpose.

2146
03:30:18,488 --> 03:30:26,553
[SPEAKER_42]: But either way, I am happy to refer this to the committee on resident services, probably, yeah.

2147
03:30:26,853 --> 03:30:28,435
[SPEAKER_37]: City clerk.

2148
03:30:28,535 --> 03:30:30,896
[SPEAKER_37]: Ooh, he's a councilor now.

2149
03:30:31,417 --> 03:30:32,618
[SPEAKER_29]: Clerk of the council.

2150
03:30:32,638 --> 03:30:36,100
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor, if you'd let me interrupt for a second.

2151
03:30:39,781 --> 03:30:47,125
[SPEAKER_29]: In my previous iteration in state government, we did some training sessions with members of the MassDOT board.

2152
03:30:48,246 --> 03:30:49,687
[SPEAKER_29]: We actually had the general counsel in the room.

2153
03:30:49,727 --> 03:30:54,109
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't have a city solicitor, but we had the general counsel in the room to make sure that nobody deliberated.

2154
03:30:54,129 --> 03:30:55,230
[SPEAKER_29]: There was very specific rules.

2155
03:30:55,610 --> 03:30:59,232
[SPEAKER_29]: So let me do a little research on that because there may be a way to do that.

2156
03:30:59,813 --> 03:31:06,677
[SPEAKER_29]: Obviously, you're correct because you wanna do it without violating the meeting law, but there may be a way to have the training without violating the meeting law.

2157
03:31:06,697 --> 03:31:08,197
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you let me do a little research on it,

2158
03:31:09,338 --> 03:31:10,439
[SPEAKER_29]: find some answers for you.

2159
03:31:10,840 --> 03:31:11,160
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2160
03:31:11,500 --> 03:31:12,681
[SPEAKER_42]: I would appreciate that.

2161
03:31:12,781 --> 03:31:24,173
[SPEAKER_42]: But I would motion to request that the clerk does that research, but also that we refer this to the resident services subcommittee.

2162
03:31:25,649 --> 03:31:29,872
[SPEAKER_37]: on the motion of Councilor Zara to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Subcommittee.

2163
03:31:29,932 --> 03:31:30,593
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Sang.

2164
03:31:30,793 --> 03:31:31,133
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2165
03:31:31,473 --> 03:31:31,974
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll be brief.

2166
03:31:32,194 --> 03:31:34,655
[SPEAKER_28]: I also talked to Director Nwaje about this.

2167
03:31:34,816 --> 03:31:37,037
[SPEAKER_28]: Obviously, I think we're all very excited about it.

2168
03:31:38,178 --> 03:31:44,923
[SPEAKER_28]: An idea that we had started to talk about before we got pulled away from each other was including boards and commissions in this as well.

2169
03:31:46,043 --> 03:31:54,890
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a feeling in the office that perhaps we could do more to align everyone with how DEI works in Medford.

2170
03:31:55,910 --> 03:32:02,873
[SPEAKER_28]: especially given that there are a lot of updates in recent years, and there haven't been many, if any, trainings on this for boards and commissions.

2171
03:32:03,374 --> 03:32:13,578
[SPEAKER_28]: And so I would love, if you were amenable, for this to be amended to add exploring doing this for boards and commissions.

2172
03:32:15,559 --> 03:32:16,219
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm amenable.

2173
03:32:16,459 --> 03:32:16,700
[SPEAKER_37]: Great.

2174
03:32:17,160 --> 03:32:21,342
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Lazaro, seconded by Councilor Sang, as amended by Councilor Sang.

2175
03:32:21,382 --> 03:32:21,922
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Kalan.

2176
03:32:24,938 --> 03:32:26,459
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, you were seconding, sorry.

2177
03:32:27,500 --> 03:32:28,441
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor.

2178
03:32:28,882 --> 03:32:28,962
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2179
03:32:28,982 --> 03:32:29,342
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

2180
03:32:29,402 --> 03:32:29,982
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

2181
03:32:30,023 --> 03:32:32,565
[SPEAKER_37]: Referred to Resident Services and Public Engagement.

2182
03:32:32,585 --> 03:32:33,205
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-02.

2183
03:32:36,748 --> 03:32:37,289
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, yes.

2184
03:32:38,090 --> 03:32:38,910
[SPEAKER_37]: Sorry, Patrick.

2185
03:32:40,031 --> 03:32:40,792
[SPEAKER_37]: The chair is tired.

2186
03:32:40,912 --> 03:32:43,394
[SPEAKER_37]: Patrick, we'll take your comment.

2187
03:32:46,997 --> 03:32:48,619
[SPEAKER_27]: Patrick Clark in 50 Princeton Street.

2188
03:32:50,273 --> 03:32:53,416
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to commend Councilor Lazaro for putting this motion forward.

2189
03:32:54,277 --> 03:33:01,043
[SPEAKER_27]: I share conditional enthusiasm for biannual DEI training and encourage City Council's consideration of the following conditions.

2190
03:33:01,844 --> 03:33:13,114
[SPEAKER_27]: DEI training could be folded into an overall city employee training, also including nepotism and conflict of interest, where all three together will bring forward the most competent and qualified candidates.

2191
03:33:14,366 --> 03:33:23,474
[SPEAKER_27]: The nepotism section would emphasize prevention of the old boys club of private deals and back-slapping, where family lineage and patronage determine qualification for government service.

2192
03:33:24,235 --> 03:33:41,570
[SPEAKER_27]: The DEI section could emphasize variety and integration of broadly cross-sectional experiences and skills across government, in practice and in recruiting, as opposed to simply patronizing box-ticking visual diversity, which can also lead to poor qualifications along a path parallel to nepotism.

2193
03:33:42,674 --> 03:33:59,781
[SPEAKER_27]: Three, the conflict of interest section could emphasize public disclosure of membership in or receipt of resources from state, national, or global organizations, whether they be in the form of a hierarchy or network whose stated goals undermine the fulfillment of responsibilities as an employee of the city of Medford.

2194
03:34:00,501 --> 03:34:10,107
[SPEAKER_27]: These trainings would not only be undergone by city employees during their tenure, but also publicly disclosed and advertised in a place of common access during campaigns or before hirings.

2195
03:34:10,728 --> 03:34:17,512
[SPEAKER_27]: This would fulfill both the calls for transparency, competence, and integrity within government and between the public and one fell swoop.

2196
03:34:18,133 --> 03:34:30,321
[SPEAKER_27]: If implemented and followed in the true spirit of this proposal, these measures will prevent the kind of mob formation, trials by ordeal, and loyalty tests recently depicted in the film Oppenheimer from being carried out in Medford.

2197
03:34:31,042 --> 03:34:41,196
[SPEAKER_27]: Times of high confusion, stress, and suspicion coupled with low transparency have often congealed into culture wars attempting to rip some bogeyman or folk devil out by the roots.

2198
03:34:41,617 --> 03:34:45,602
[SPEAKER_27]: Witches, communists, fascists, Jews, racists, anti-Semites.

2199
03:34:46,263 --> 03:35:01,368
[SPEAKER_27]: We could take a wider lens on what DEI, in union with other measures, could do for Medford's future, or we could see it turn into proving one's diversity credentials in an oppressive, harassing, ultimately counterproductive manner equal and opposite to proving one's patriotism credentials.

2200
03:35:01,928 --> 03:35:02,868
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's proceed wisely.

2201
03:35:03,408 --> 03:35:03,709
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2202
03:35:04,129 --> 03:35:10,711
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you for your comment, and Mr. Clerk, please record that as comment on the record for item 24-022, and my apologies for not calling it.

2203
03:35:11,371 --> 03:35:13,292
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Castaneda, name and address for the record, please.

2204
03:35:13,353 --> 03:35:14,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Castaneda E. Smith.

2205
03:35:15,254 --> 03:35:18,636
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's great that you're going to do this DIA education thing.

2206
03:35:19,017 --> 03:35:19,697
[SPEAKER_22]: It's wonderful.

2207
03:35:20,178 --> 03:35:33,527
[SPEAKER_22]: But on the other hand, I believe the most qualified job applicants should get hired for the job in the name of public safety and efficiency in our government and private sector, in my opinion.

2208
03:35:35,128 --> 03:35:36,630
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

2209
03:35:38,740 --> 03:35:46,945
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-023, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the City of Medford explore the options, costs, and requirements to open a warming and cooling center for adults experiencing homelessness in December 2024.

2210
03:35:47,045 --> 03:35:56,692
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council invite representatives from the administration, including the Board of Health, along with stakeholders in our community and in neighboring communities to attend meetings on this topic.

2211
03:35:57,212 --> 03:35:57,893
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Lazaro.

2212
03:35:59,619 --> 03:36:08,383
[SPEAKER_42]: I will start by saying that I'm planning to refer this to the committee on public health and community safety.

2213
03:36:09,284 --> 03:36:21,330
[SPEAKER_42]: I have been emailing with our board of health folks with a number of stakeholders in the city.

2214
03:36:21,550 --> 03:36:26,433
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think the main concern, the main issue I anticipate is space.

2215
03:36:27,518 --> 03:36:45,245
[SPEAKER_42]: Somerville and Revere have both opened warming centers this winter, using a model that is based on the Malden Warming Center, which I help run in Malden, which is a nonprofit, but they use that sort of as a template.

2216
03:36:46,065 --> 03:36:54,869
[SPEAKER_42]: And those cities, Somerville and Revere, have opened their centers by contracting with Housing Families, which is another nonprofit.

2217
03:36:55,501 --> 03:37:03,667
[SPEAKER_42]: So the cities use city buildings and they pay housing families to operate the warming centers.

2218
03:37:03,747 --> 03:37:05,448
[SPEAKER_42]: So I spoke with

2219
03:37:09,232 --> 03:37:18,954
[SPEAKER_42]: a woman in Somerville who told me it costs them about $200,000 to contract housing families, and they use the armory.

2220
03:37:18,974 --> 03:37:27,495
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm trying to sort of figure out what the ballpark would be for Medford to run something like that for next year.

2221
03:37:28,495 --> 03:37:36,117
[SPEAKER_42]: But mostly what I want to do is figure out all of that in a committee meeting with all of the people that would be involved in

2222
03:37:37,785 --> 03:38:06,061
[SPEAKER_42]: making something like that happen, but I think the most critical thing for Medford will be space, and if we can find something that is either city-owned or affordable enough for us to make it happen, and if we have any kind of space in the budget, and I'm not sure if we do, or if we would need to do something where we try to just find a nonprofit or a church group that wants to try to run it for us, but

2223
03:38:07,202 --> 03:38:18,165
[SPEAKER_42]: The critical thing that I've observed from my work with unhoused adults in this region is that homelessness isn't a municipal issue, it's a regional issue.

2224
03:38:18,305 --> 03:38:24,147
[SPEAKER_42]: So once you lose your housing, you're not considered a resident of anywhere anymore.

2225
03:38:24,467 --> 03:38:26,187
[SPEAKER_42]: You just kind of go where the services are.

2226
03:38:26,807 --> 03:38:30,428
[SPEAKER_42]: So you're not bound by the lines in a city.

2227
03:38:30,488 --> 03:38:35,950
[SPEAKER_42]: And I've had guests at the Malden Warming Center that I knew from Medford because

2228
03:38:37,070 --> 03:38:39,031
[SPEAKER_42]: I knew them from town.

2229
03:38:39,571 --> 03:38:41,472
[SPEAKER_42]: So I know that there is need in Medford.

2230
03:38:42,212 --> 03:38:43,972
[SPEAKER_42]: And I know that we could help a lot of people.

2231
03:38:44,212 --> 03:38:47,893
[SPEAKER_42]: And I know that we could partner with other folks in the region.

2232
03:38:48,534 --> 03:38:50,854
[SPEAKER_42]: And we could all do a lot of good.

2233
03:38:51,215 --> 03:38:59,197
[SPEAKER_42]: So I look forward to having deeper conversations with people once we can spend more time in committee talking about it.

2234
03:39:00,714 --> 03:39:01,174
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2235
03:39:01,234 --> 03:39:06,437
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councilor Lazaro to refer to public health and community safety, seconded by Councilor Seng.

2236
03:39:06,498 --> 03:39:07,078
[SPEAKER_37]: Any discussion?

2237
03:39:08,018 --> 03:39:08,759
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Collins.

2238
03:39:09,759 --> 03:39:10,600
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, President Behrs.

2239
03:39:10,820 --> 03:39:12,921
[SPEAKER_65]: I appreciate Councilor Lazaro for bringing this forward.

2240
03:39:13,482 --> 03:39:19,125
[SPEAKER_65]: I'm really excited to start a discussion of what we can do to pilot a warming and cooling center of our own here in Medford.

2241
03:39:20,026 --> 03:39:29,932
[SPEAKER_65]: As Councilor Lazaro stated, we've known for a long time now that it's not sustainable to keep directing our unhoused neighbors to the resources in other communities to stay safe and warm at night.

2242
03:39:30,652 --> 03:39:33,013
[SPEAKER_65]: communities and other resources are already overburdened.

2243
03:39:33,893 --> 03:39:39,374
[SPEAKER_65]: We need to start sometime at figuring out a path towards strengthening our own safety net and supportive services here in Medford.

2244
03:39:40,374 --> 03:39:49,856
[SPEAKER_65]: Obviously, this is really complicated and expensive, but it's important, and we all know that Medford has the creativity and the collaboration and the spirit of service to get it done.

2245
03:39:51,016 --> 03:39:52,096
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councillor Collins.

2246
03:39:52,156 --> 03:39:53,937
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

2247
03:39:55,877 --> 03:39:59,658
[SPEAKER_37]: Any discussion by members of the public, either in the chamber or on Zoom?

2248
03:40:02,017 --> 03:40:10,382
[SPEAKER_37]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Zaro to refer to public health and community safety, seconded by Councilor, Vice President Collins.

2249
03:40:10,923 --> 03:40:11,703
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

2250
03:40:11,723 --> 03:40:12,223
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2251
03:40:12,484 --> 03:40:12,864
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

2252
03:40:12,924 --> 03:40:13,664
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

2253
03:40:15,585 --> 03:40:16,266
[SPEAKER_37]: Madam Vice President.

2254
03:40:17,367 --> 03:40:21,529
[SPEAKER_65]: Motion to take paper 24028 out of order.

2255
03:40:23,092 --> 03:40:26,554
[SPEAKER_37]: on the motion to take paper 24028 under suspension.

2256
03:40:26,574 --> 03:40:28,735
[SPEAKER_37]: Suspend the rules to take paper 24-028.

2257
03:40:29,235 --> 03:40:29,975
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by?

2258
03:40:30,596 --> 03:40:31,616
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by Councillor Sang.

2259
03:40:31,636 --> 03:40:32,317
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favour?

2260
03:40:32,897 --> 03:40:33,217
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

2261
03:40:33,257 --> 03:40:33,997
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

2262
03:40:34,838 --> 03:40:36,679
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm giving the chair to the vice-chair.

2263
03:40:55,538 --> 03:40:56,218
[SPEAKER_55]: What page is it on?

2264
03:40:56,238 --> 03:40:56,778
[SPEAKER_55]: Anybody know?

2265
03:40:56,919 --> 03:40:57,479
[SPEAKER_55]: The full text?

2266
03:40:59,660 --> 03:41:00,120
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

2267
03:41:01,640 --> 03:41:05,402
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

2268
03:41:05,502 --> 03:41:05,682
[SPEAKER_65]: Thanks.

2269
03:41:05,742 --> 03:41:05,982
[SPEAKER_65]: I got it.

2270
03:41:06,662 --> 03:41:10,524
[SPEAKER_65]: Um, can you hear me?

2271
03:41:22,950 --> 03:41:25,753
[SPEAKER_65]: 24028 offered by President Bayer's resolution calling on U.S.

2272
03:41:25,773 --> 03:41:27,575
[SPEAKER_65]: government to end blockade of Cuba.

2273
03:41:29,957 --> 03:41:37,285
[SPEAKER_65]: Whereas for 60 years, the United States has imposed an embargo on Cuba, having a devastating economic, social, and political impact on the people of Cuba.

2274
03:41:37,866 --> 03:41:38,847
[SPEAKER_65]: And whereas U.S.

2275
03:41:38,887 --> 03:41:40,689
[SPEAKER_65]: Senators Warren and Markey, U.S.

2276
03:41:40,729 --> 03:41:43,972
[SPEAKER_65]: Representatives McGovern, Presley, Lynch, Moulton, and Tran,

2277
03:41:44,952 --> 03:41:58,864
[SPEAKER_65]: city councils in neighborhood cities, and many state and local officials have called on the Biden administration to restore the policies of the Obama administration, reducing travel restrictions and removing Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list that were reversed under the Trump administration.

2278
03:41:59,164 --> 03:42:09,032
[SPEAKER_65]: And whereas the continuation of this policy has a detrimental impact on Medford residents and organizations who have family, business and research ties with people and organizations in Cuba.

2279
03:42:09,612 --> 03:42:13,916
[SPEAKER_65]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford city council that we urge the Biden administration

2280
03:42:14,540 --> 03:42:39,321
[SPEAKER_65]: and our congressional delegation to reverse the Trump decision to add Cuba to the state sponsors of terrorism list and restrict travel between the two countries and be it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we urge our congressional delegation to pass legislation to repeal any laws regarding the embargo on Cuba and be it further resolved that the city clerk please submit this resolution to the offices of Senator Warren, Senator Markey and Representative Clark.

2281
03:42:40,267 --> 03:42:40,767
[SPEAKER_65]: President Beers.

2282
03:42:41,108 --> 03:42:42,328
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

2283
03:42:43,029 --> 03:42:44,410
[SPEAKER_37]: I appreciate, uh.

2284
03:42:45,891 --> 03:42:52,495
[SPEAKER_37]: All of the folks who I've spoken to about putting this resolution forward in the City Council on the City Council agenda.

2285
03:42:53,276 --> 03:43:00,901
[SPEAKER_37]: There is a large and vibrant movement to end the embargo and to remove Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list and.

2286
03:43:01,641 --> 03:43:04,704
[SPEAKER_37]: There's several, many, many reasons why that's true.

2287
03:43:05,324 --> 03:43:11,369
[SPEAKER_37]: One of those reasons is that we already had done some de-escalatory work that was reversed by the Trump administration.

2288
03:43:11,409 --> 03:43:12,070
[SPEAKER_37]: It wasn't enough.

2289
03:43:12,630 --> 03:43:24,680
[SPEAKER_37]: But to reimpose Cold War, Red Scare rules and thoughts on the millions of people impacted by the embargo and the other restrictions

2290
03:43:26,328 --> 03:43:30,209
[SPEAKER_37]: that the United States places on Cuba for imperialist reasons is just unacceptable.

2291
03:43:30,349 --> 03:43:33,210
[SPEAKER_37]: So with that, I have put this forward.

2292
03:43:33,230 --> 03:43:34,970
[SPEAKER_37]: I want to add our voice to the chorus.

2293
03:43:35,430 --> 03:43:37,411
[SPEAKER_37]: I do have two statements I want to make.

2294
03:43:37,451 --> 03:43:41,472
[SPEAKER_37]: I do want to thank folks who reached out and noted that a blockade is different than an embargo.

2295
03:43:41,972 --> 03:43:45,673
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'll make sure that the short title matches the long resolution next time.

2296
03:43:46,033 --> 03:43:52,274
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'd also like to amend this to include that we submit this resolution to the president as well.

2297
03:43:54,615 --> 03:43:55,395
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, President Behrs.

2298
03:43:56,041 --> 03:43:57,522
[SPEAKER_65]: Any further comment from Councillors?

2299
03:43:57,582 --> 03:43:58,062
[SPEAKER_65]: Councillor Seng.

2300
03:43:59,243 --> 03:44:00,864
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, President Behrs, for introducing this.

2301
03:44:00,884 --> 03:44:02,205
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanted to lend my support.

2302
03:44:02,926 --> 03:44:04,567
[SPEAKER_28]: I talked about the sanctity of life earlier.

2303
03:44:05,628 --> 03:44:13,373
[SPEAKER_28]: Giving people food, medicine, water, that very much is in line with the sanctity of life and preserving it.

2304
03:44:14,134 --> 03:44:20,498
[SPEAKER_28]: We might not agree with the country for political reasons, but we can't hold its people hostage.

2305
03:44:23,080 --> 03:44:23,901
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, Councillor Seng.

2306
03:44:24,041 --> 03:44:25,722
[SPEAKER_65]: Any further comments from members of the Council?

2307
03:44:27,028 --> 03:44:28,269
[SPEAKER_65]: Any members of the public who would wish to speak?

2308
03:44:29,449 --> 03:44:39,254
[SPEAKER_37]: Madam Chair, just if I may also add, I just wanted to add in that it's really important to get this on the desk of Representative Clark.

2309
03:44:40,234 --> 03:44:45,117
[SPEAKER_37]: As you noted, Senators Warren and Markey have supported a number of these proposals, as well as Reps.

2310
03:44:45,137 --> 03:44:46,917
[SPEAKER_37]: McGovern, Pressley-Lynch, Moulton-Linterhan.

2311
03:44:46,997 --> 03:44:48,078
[SPEAKER_37]: Representative Clark has not.

2312
03:44:48,538 --> 03:44:53,160
[SPEAKER_37]: So that is something where this is directly providing some advocacy on our federal delegate.

2313
03:44:53,460 --> 03:44:54,501
[SPEAKER_37]: Representative Clark, thank you.

2314
03:44:55,327 --> 03:44:56,127
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, President Behrs.

2315
03:44:57,368 --> 03:44:58,569
[SPEAKER_65]: Feel free to approach the podium.

2316
03:44:58,989 --> 03:45:01,050
[SPEAKER_65]: Please give your name and address for the record.

2317
03:45:02,190 --> 03:45:03,051
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, counselors.

2318
03:45:03,091 --> 03:45:04,371
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Nicholas Shirleo.

2319
03:45:04,451 --> 03:45:05,792
[SPEAKER_24]: I live at 40 Robinson Road.

2320
03:45:05,812 --> 03:45:11,875
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm a lifetime Medford resident, an attorney, and director of an international relations publication.

2321
03:45:11,895 --> 03:45:14,856
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not speaking on behalf of that publication tonight.

2322
03:45:15,576 --> 03:45:18,678
[SPEAKER_24]: I am, though, speaking in opposition personally to the resolution.

2323
03:45:19,619 --> 03:45:36,410
[SPEAKER_24]: Putting aside why the council is spending time crafting legislation on international politics when our city faces plenty of problems on its own, the proposed resolution in effect supports the totalitarian government of Cuba, a socialist dictatorship with a horrendous human rights record.

2324
03:45:37,230 --> 03:45:53,801
[SPEAKER_24]: As Human Rights Watch, one of many organizations, has highlighted, Cuban government human rights abuses have included arbitrary arrests of activists and independent journalists, torture of prisoners, significant repression of free speech, and extrajudicial killings.

2325
03:45:55,236 --> 03:45:57,999
[SPEAKER_24]: Nearly a million people have fled Cuba's communist regime.

2326
03:45:58,499 --> 03:46:02,203
[SPEAKER_24]: Imagine some or many have called Medford their home.

2327
03:46:03,144 --> 03:46:08,589
[SPEAKER_24]: We should embrace these people, not tout Cuban government propaganda at our city council meetings.

2328
03:46:09,530 --> 03:46:12,973
[SPEAKER_24]: Put simply, a vote for this resolution is a vote in favor of the current regime.

2329
03:46:13,914 --> 03:46:17,297
[SPEAKER_24]: The United States of America should not be doing business with dictatorships.

2330
03:46:18,178 --> 03:46:19,879
[SPEAKER_24]: Why would Medford support the contrary?

2331
03:46:20,000 --> 03:46:20,320
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2332
03:46:22,674 --> 03:46:23,574
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you very much for your comment.

2333
03:46:23,994 --> 03:46:28,096
[SPEAKER_65]: Before we get to you, I'm just going to go to a hand raised on Zoom, then we'll get right along to the folks at the podium.

2334
03:46:28,676 --> 03:46:29,877
[SPEAKER_65]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

2335
03:46:29,897 --> 03:46:31,877
[SPEAKER_65]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2336
03:46:36,719 --> 03:46:37,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm Matthew Page Lieberman.

2337
03:46:37,900 --> 03:46:39,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I live at 15 Canal Street.

2338
03:46:39,100 --> 03:46:41,101
[SPEAKER_14]: I very much support this.

2339
03:46:41,161 --> 03:46:43,762
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not much I could say that wasn't already covered in the text.

2340
03:46:44,682 --> 03:46:45,523
[SPEAKER_14]: of the resolution.

2341
03:46:45,543 --> 03:47:03,264
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that it's incredibly, just like with the one about Gaza, we have, fortunately, we have Edwards, Markey, and Warren's support, but we have to play our role in order to also nudge.

2342
03:47:04,105 --> 03:47:06,106
[SPEAKER_14]: our representative, Catherine Clark.

2343
03:47:08,486 --> 03:47:11,107
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there are a few questions that should be asked.

2344
03:47:11,187 --> 03:47:16,549
[SPEAKER_14]: One of them is, what has 60 years of this actually done to improve the situation in Cuba?

2345
03:47:16,589 --> 03:47:21,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think anybody here is denying what the Castro regime did, nor the Diaz-Canel one currently.

2346
03:47:22,051 --> 03:47:23,151
[SPEAKER_14]: How is that going?

2347
03:47:23,792 --> 03:47:25,612
[SPEAKER_14]: How is that democratizing the place?

2348
03:47:26,112 --> 03:47:28,053
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one really important question.

2349
03:47:28,473 --> 03:47:28,893
[SPEAKER_14]: to ask.

2350
03:47:28,933 --> 03:47:38,517
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think before people speak on supporting the continuation of this embargo, they should be able to answer how this has brought any democracy forward.

2351
03:47:39,078 --> 03:47:45,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Just one last thing, though, as far as the distinction between embargo and blockade, it is true that this is an embargo.

2352
03:47:45,541 --> 03:47:55,425
[SPEAKER_14]: However, the reason a lot of times that people say it's a blockade is because US government as well puts pressure on additional countries saying, we will not help you financially.

2353
03:47:56,331 --> 03:48:00,765
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if you go and do any kind of deals with Cuba again, like this has been.

2354
03:48:02,034 --> 03:48:10,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Going on repeatedly, the United Nations, just like with Gaza, continues to ask the US to stop this, to stop this ridiculous economic warfare.

2355
03:48:10,457 --> 03:48:13,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And the US and Israel just keeps voting against it.

2356
03:48:13,438 --> 03:48:13,838
[SPEAKER_14]: For why?

2357
03:48:13,858 --> 03:48:19,900
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the obvious reason is, I think a lot of us know, is that there are cynical electoral reasons, particularly in Florida.

2358
03:48:20,361 --> 03:48:26,843
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't go into any more depth, but on the merits, on the merits, the continuation of this embargo simply cannot be justified.

2359
03:48:28,924 --> 03:48:29,524
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you very much.

2360
03:48:31,722 --> 03:48:32,723
[SPEAKER_71]: Name and address for the record, please.

2361
03:48:33,324 --> 03:48:34,505
[SPEAKER_71]: Hey, I'm Claire Blackman.

2362
03:48:34,625 --> 03:48:36,066
[SPEAKER_71]: I live on Bristol Road in Medford.

2363
03:48:37,027 --> 03:48:41,211
[SPEAKER_71]: I had the honor of going to Cuba with the Democratic Socialist of America delegation this past fall.

2364
03:48:41,691 --> 03:48:54,422
[SPEAKER_71]: And it was inspiring to see a country with so much political will to do so much for their people, to see Cuba's massive accomplishments in health care and free education, even under the crippling US embargo.

2365
03:48:55,103 --> 03:49:01,587
[SPEAKER_71]: The embargo is an immoral collective punishment of the Cuban people, which has continued for 60 years to no good end.

2366
03:49:02,247 --> 03:49:12,733
[SPEAKER_71]: In Cuba, the embargo means they can't get building materials, they can't take out lines of credit, they can't get vital health care equipment, to the point where they have to reuse pacemakers because they are manufactured in the US.

2367
03:49:13,613 --> 03:49:15,335
[SPEAKER_71]: It is not the Cold War anymore.

2368
03:49:15,835 --> 03:49:18,798
[SPEAKER_71]: We can benefit from Cuba's great advances in health care especially.

2369
03:49:19,258 --> 03:49:24,903
[SPEAKER_71]: Medford residents could benefit from their lung cancer vaccine, to say nothing of opening trade and tourism.

2370
03:49:25,523 --> 03:49:29,947
[SPEAKER_71]: Cuba is no threat to us, and it's offensive propaganda to say it's a dictatorship.

2371
03:49:31,128 --> 03:49:37,513
[SPEAKER_71]: Everywhere I went in Cuba, Cubans expressed solidarity with Palestinians because they know this is all one struggle against imperialism.

2372
03:49:38,013 --> 03:49:45,558
[SPEAKER_71]: Let's add our voices to the chorus and tell Congress to remove Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list, lift the embargo, and let Cuba live.

2373
03:49:45,939 --> 03:49:47,099
[SPEAKER_71]: Cuba si, bloqueo no.

2374
03:49:49,801 --> 03:49:50,422
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you very much.

2375
03:49:52,363 --> 03:49:53,204
[SPEAKER_65]: Name and address for the record.

2376
03:49:53,960 --> 03:49:55,120
[SPEAKER_76]: My name is Trent Sandland.

2377
03:49:55,160 --> 03:49:56,521
[SPEAKER_76]: I'm a resident of Cambridge.

2378
03:49:56,581 --> 03:50:02,023
[SPEAKER_76]: I just wanted to express my commendation to the council for putting this resolution forward.

2379
03:50:02,043 --> 03:50:08,424
[SPEAKER_76]: Yeah, the blockade, the embargo, it does no one any good.

2380
03:50:08,484 --> 03:50:10,945
[SPEAKER_76]: It doesn't do anything to advance the cause of Cuban freedom.

2381
03:50:11,345 --> 03:50:15,126
[SPEAKER_76]: It's only served to immiserate the Cuban population for decades.

2382
03:50:15,187 --> 03:50:15,467
[SPEAKER_76]: Thank you.

2383
03:50:17,007 --> 03:50:17,247
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you.

2384
03:50:17,267 --> 03:50:20,028
[SPEAKER_65]: All right, Patrick, I think we have your address already.

2385
03:50:20,543 --> 03:50:22,404
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, if you need to find me.

2386
03:50:23,184 --> 03:50:34,170
[SPEAKER_27]: So my concern with this, not to take away from any of the testimony from the Gaza issue earlier, it was powerful and it was meaningful.

2387
03:50:35,251 --> 03:50:38,973
[SPEAKER_27]: My concern is really the precedent that it sends that

2388
03:50:40,006 --> 03:50:44,830
[SPEAKER_27]: If Gaza or if Cuba are local issues, then what isn't?

2389
03:50:45,151 --> 03:50:47,973
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I mean, should we be talking about the Rohingya Muslims?

2390
03:50:48,013 --> 03:50:49,935
[SPEAKER_27]: Should we be talking about the Uyghurs in China?

2391
03:50:49,975 --> 03:50:55,140
[SPEAKER_27]: Should we be talking about what's going on in Colombia and Argentina and anywhere in the world?

2392
03:50:55,180 --> 03:50:59,163
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, in a sense, yes, but should it be here in these chambers?

2393
03:50:59,183 --> 03:51:00,244
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that there's

2394
03:51:00,905 --> 03:51:19,246
[SPEAKER_27]: we have to start to put some structure in place where, you know, there's personal matters, there's local matters, there's state matters, there's national matters, there's global matters, and they're all important, but, and I completely agree that Medford is not this, you know,

2395
03:51:21,724 --> 03:51:31,112
[SPEAKER_27]: completely sealed off entity it were affected by by immigration were affected by by technology changes were affected by inflation.

2396
03:51:31,132 --> 03:51:34,455
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not her medically sealed but.

2397
03:51:35,967 --> 03:51:46,690
[SPEAKER_27]: the amount of energy that will go into fighting global issues in these chambers will pull energy away from all of these other things that truly are locally confined issues.

2398
03:51:46,850 --> 03:51:49,611
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's like the body needs to continue to function.

2399
03:51:49,731 --> 03:51:53,892
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you pump all the blood towards one organ, then all the other organs start to die.

2400
03:51:53,912 --> 03:51:58,573
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that's not maybe the best analogy, but it's the best analogy I can think of.

2401
03:51:58,793 --> 03:52:00,934
[SPEAKER_27]: So I just wanted to put that on the record.

2402
03:52:00,974 --> 03:52:01,234
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2403
03:52:03,049 --> 03:52:03,609
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, Patrick.

2404
03:52:03,629 --> 03:52:08,330
[SPEAKER_65]: I think it remains to be seen whether it's a zero-sum equation, but your comments are duly noted and appreciated.

2405
03:52:09,570 --> 03:52:10,990
[SPEAKER_65]: Mr. Castagnetti, go ahead.

2406
03:52:11,050 --> 03:52:14,871
[SPEAKER_22]: Andrew Castagnetti, Medford.

2407
03:52:16,611 --> 03:52:23,913
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember like it was yesterday when JFK put the embargo on Cuba with the cruise ship missiles there.

2408
03:52:25,553 --> 03:52:31,194
[SPEAKER_22]: We felt like we were going to get wiped out by nuclear missiles from Russia, I guess.

2409
03:52:32,443 --> 03:52:34,303
[SPEAKER_22]: or the Soviet Union at that time.

2410
03:52:37,564 --> 03:52:50,206
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's great to open up relations with Cuba, personally speaking, providing they don't have any military, especially foreign military installations there.

2411
03:52:53,046 --> 03:53:01,748
[SPEAKER_22]: And they don't empty their prisons and their asylums into the continental USA, as they have done in the past.

2412
03:53:03,570 --> 03:53:08,515
[SPEAKER_22]: So saying that, I'm okay with it because Cuban cigars can't be beat.

2413
03:53:15,205 --> 03:53:16,526
[SPEAKER_36]: Name and address again for the record, please.

2414
03:53:16,726 --> 03:53:18,167
[SPEAKER_36]: Nate Merritt, 373 Roofside Ave.

2415
03:53:19,407 --> 03:53:31,494
[SPEAKER_36]: I guess I'm kind of curious as to why the city of Medford thinks that it knows or should be able to determine whether or not a country should be on the state sponsor of terrorist.

2416
03:53:32,115 --> 03:53:37,258
[SPEAKER_36]: This country has a wonderful defense and intelligence apparatus that knows more about the terrorist activities.

2417
03:53:38,078 --> 03:53:40,320
[SPEAKER_36]: than anyone in this community.

2418
03:53:40,340 --> 03:53:46,986
[SPEAKER_36]: So I guess I'm just questioning why this city feels like it maybe knows more than the federal government.

2419
03:53:47,967 --> 03:53:59,337
[SPEAKER_36]: And if the motivation behind it is because Trump did something, and therefore we need to unwind what Trump did because it's something Trump did, that's a poor decision.

2420
03:54:00,998 --> 03:54:02,079
[SPEAKER_36]: Things happen in time.

2421
03:54:02,760 --> 03:54:04,581
[SPEAKER_36]: Different people are in different administrations.

2422
03:54:05,540 --> 03:54:08,543
[SPEAKER_36]: But whoever the president is, they're not a dictator in this country.

2423
03:54:09,484 --> 03:54:11,946
[SPEAKER_36]: There's a whole bunch of staff that work behind the scenes.

2424
03:54:13,147 --> 03:54:24,898
[SPEAKER_36]: So before you pass something where I think you're kind of ill-posed, I'd really question, really, can you make that judgment to say they should be removed without having the data to back it up?

2425
03:54:25,439 --> 03:54:25,619
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2426
03:54:28,496 --> 03:54:28,936
[SPEAKER_37]: It's embarrassing.

2427
03:54:29,116 --> 03:54:29,537
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2428
03:54:29,717 --> 03:54:33,120
[SPEAKER_37]: And apologies to my colleagues that I'm sitting here and talking.

2429
03:54:33,880 --> 03:54:37,763
[SPEAKER_37]: Usually I'm up there quiet, and I'm sure that some of my colleagues appreciate that.

2430
03:54:41,090 --> 03:54:46,834
[SPEAKER_37]: at least based on past experience, regardless of any affiliation, by the way.

2431
03:54:46,874 --> 03:54:47,615
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm sure that's true.

2432
03:54:48,335 --> 03:54:50,397
[SPEAKER_37]: I just want to say a couple things.

2433
03:54:50,597 --> 03:54:53,079
[SPEAKER_37]: One, there's been a lot of commentary lately.

2434
03:54:53,719 --> 03:54:58,242
[SPEAKER_37]: The council's so focused on this, they're not going to be able to focus on the other thing.

2435
03:54:59,303 --> 03:55:01,344
[SPEAKER_37]: We put out a 40-page governing agenda.

2436
03:55:02,469 --> 03:55:03,590
[SPEAKER_37]: with dozens of issues.

2437
03:55:04,651 --> 03:55:08,593
[SPEAKER_37]: I appreciate the concern that we're going to focus too much on one thing and not be able to do the other.

2438
03:55:08,613 --> 03:55:10,675
[SPEAKER_37]: I just don't believe it to be true.

2439
03:55:12,716 --> 03:55:23,083
[SPEAKER_37]: The other thing I want to say just on the specifics, the Obama administration, the defense apparatus, whatever we want to say, they removed Cuba from the state's positive terrorism list.

2440
03:55:24,564 --> 03:55:25,005
[SPEAKER_37]: The date

2441
03:55:26,204 --> 03:55:28,865
[SPEAKER_37]: that the Trump administration put them back on was January 12, 2021.

2442
03:55:29,346 --> 03:55:33,768
[SPEAKER_37]: It was six days after Trump literally tried to be a dictator.

2443
03:55:34,528 --> 03:55:40,251
[SPEAKER_37]: And he did it on the way out, out of spite, to try to undermine the legacy of his predecessor.

2444
03:55:40,611 --> 03:55:44,853
[SPEAKER_37]: So, you know, I'm making kind of a liberal establishment

2445
03:55:46,394 --> 03:55:53,878
[SPEAKER_37]: you know, defense intelligence agency argument for this, but the fact that there is one kind of underlies why this is something that should just be passed.

2446
03:55:53,979 --> 03:55:55,760
[SPEAKER_37]: So I appreciate the support of my colleagues.

2447
03:55:55,780 --> 03:55:56,500
[SPEAKER_37]: I hope you vote for it.

2448
03:55:57,000 --> 03:55:57,581
[SPEAKER_37]: I move approval.

2449
03:55:58,541 --> 03:55:59,542
[SPEAKER_65]: Do I have a second on the motion?

2450
03:56:00,663 --> 03:56:01,263
[SPEAKER_65]: Councilor Callahan?

2451
03:56:03,824 --> 03:56:06,186
[SPEAKER_65]: Do folks want a roll call vote or is a voice vote fine?

2452
03:56:08,367 --> 03:56:08,887
[SPEAKER_65]: All in favor?

2453
03:56:09,708 --> 03:56:10,248
[SPEAKER_65]: Would you prefer?

2454
03:56:10,268 --> 03:56:11,529
[SPEAKER_65]: All in favor?

2455
03:56:11,549 --> 03:56:12,089
[SPEAKER_65]: Aye.

2456
03:56:12,630 --> 03:56:13,070
[SPEAKER_65]: All opposed?

2457
03:56:13,090 --> 03:56:13,350
[SPEAKER_65]: Aye.

2458
03:56:17,250 --> 03:56:19,281
[SPEAKER_65]: Motion passes with one note of dissent.

2459
03:56:31,929 --> 03:56:48,360
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Council Vice President concert to the regular order of business seconded by Councilor carry and all those in favor of those motion passes 24 dash 025 commercial vacancy tax whereas the city of Medford has many commercial storefronts that are either vacant or

2460
03:56:49,571 --> 03:56:53,193
[SPEAKER_37]: for unacceptably long periods of time, or are rarely and inconsistently open for business.

2461
03:56:53,333 --> 03:56:59,656
[SPEAKER_37]: And whereas there exists insufficient incentive for the owners of such property to maintain and rent their storefronts to active businesses.

2462
03:56:59,716 --> 03:57:09,181
[SPEAKER_37]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the adoption of a commercial vacancy tax, which can be applied to disincentivize these storefront properties from remaining undocupied indefinitely.

2463
03:57:10,362 --> 03:57:17,686
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved that this matter be referred to committee for further discussion with the Chief Assessor, the Finance Director, and the Economic Development Director, Councilor Lemming.

2464
03:57:18,615 --> 03:57:23,759
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, so is it sorry?

2465
03:57:23,779 --> 03:57:25,940
[SPEAKER_30]: So I didn't do this with my last motion is appropriate.

2466
03:57:25,960 --> 03:57:32,284
[SPEAKER_30]: Just start by motioning to refer to admin finance motion to refer to admin finance on the motion of Council.

2467
03:57:32,304 --> 03:57:37,128
[SPEAKER_37]: Let me to refer to the administration of the Finance Committee seconded by Councilor Callahan.

2468
03:57:38,430 --> 03:57:40,673
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there discussion or yes, Councilor Lemme.

2469
03:57:41,474 --> 03:57:55,892
[SPEAKER_30]: So, this is a so basically going going around Medford, I think it's pretty clear that we have a bit of an issue with vacant storefront properties not only storefront properties like in West Medford that have been

2470
03:57:56,893 --> 03:58:11,445
[SPEAKER_30]: unoccupied for a year and a half, going on two years, but also storefront properties that are effective, that are just not open consistently or often.

2471
03:58:12,586 --> 03:58:22,795
[SPEAKER_30]: This was a policy proposal that I brought up door-to-door continuously when people kept talking about the fact that stores are just not occupied and generally found

2472
03:58:23,696 --> 03:58:28,480
[SPEAKER_30]: I couldn't find a single person who actually opposed it when I was going door to door.

2473
03:58:28,500 --> 03:58:35,046
[SPEAKER_30]: Now, I'm going to be the first to say that this is a nuanced issue.

2474
03:58:35,086 --> 03:58:41,812
[SPEAKER_30]: The reason that people choose to create or choose to leave property unoccupied is

2475
03:58:43,493 --> 03:58:45,474
[SPEAKER_30]: there could be a lot of different reasons for that.

2476
03:58:45,514 --> 03:59:05,624
[SPEAKER_30]: And so I hope that in committee we're able to craft a policy that can incentivize businesses to open up shop to, or sorry, incentivize landlords to open up shop to good businesses around town and thereby boost the revenue in the city.

2477
03:59:06,465 --> 03:59:08,085
[SPEAKER_30]: What we would like to avoid is

2478
03:59:09,406 --> 03:59:26,919
[SPEAKER_30]: you know, businesses just deciding to rent it out to like, you know, a random, a random pawn shop or something so that we just have those springing up left and right around town or just, you know, another another kind of business that I don't want to insult by just bringing up an example.

2479
03:59:26,979 --> 03:59:30,842
[SPEAKER_30]: But the point but the point is, like, I don't want to insult pawn shop owners.

2480
03:59:30,862 --> 03:59:32,102
[SPEAKER_30]: I shouldn't I shouldn't have said that.

2481
03:59:33,223 --> 03:59:38,227
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, but but but yeah, I hope that my point I hope that my never going away.

2482
03:59:39,994 --> 03:59:44,695
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, I hope I hope that my my point is heard there.

2483
03:59:44,935 --> 03:59:59,058
[SPEAKER_30]: But, uh, you know, uh, in any case, uh, I would just I just think that this is an issue that Medford City Council really needs to, uh, really needs to address and be active about at this point.

2484
03:59:59,218 --> 04:00:02,319
[SPEAKER_30]: So I welcome any discussion on motion.

2485
04:00:02,970 --> 04:00:05,495
[SPEAKER_37]: on the motion of Councillor LAMING to proudly insult the business community.

2486
04:00:15,145 --> 04:00:17,407
[SPEAKER_30]: I apologize to any and all.

2487
04:00:18,908 --> 04:00:19,368
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm kidding.

2488
04:00:21,729 --> 04:00:25,812
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate Councilor Lemons, I think appreciation of the nuance of this issue.

2489
04:00:26,613 --> 04:00:30,075
[SPEAKER_28]: We definitely have a need to revitalize our squares.

2490
04:00:30,095 --> 04:00:36,259
[SPEAKER_28]: There are items later on in the agenda that will help us get at that as well.

2491
04:00:36,960 --> 04:00:43,684
[SPEAKER_28]: We have passed as a city council last term, numerous items to help us get there and implementing mechanisms to get there.

2492
04:00:48,989 --> 04:00:55,096
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not wrong to say that we need to do more on the issue, especially of commercial vacancies.

2493
04:00:57,099 --> 04:01:05,428
[SPEAKER_28]: We want to be bringing people into the square, into all of our squares, if we don't have populated storefronts.

2494
04:01:06,309 --> 04:01:07,990
[SPEAKER_28]: we disincentivize that.

2495
04:01:08,710 --> 04:01:20,174
[SPEAKER_28]: At the same time, the nuances of the questions of turnover and the types of businesses that you'll want to see are extremely relevant in discussing this matter as well, which Councillor Lemming has noted.

2496
04:01:21,275 --> 04:01:26,337
[SPEAKER_28]: I've sat down with the city staff on a few occasions before, both this term and last term, to talk about

2497
04:01:27,137 --> 04:01:38,027
[SPEAKER_28]: this idea and there are different views of it, but I think broadly the consensus is we should also as a council consider what carrots we want to accompany the stick.

2498
04:01:39,268 --> 04:01:50,138
[SPEAKER_28]: There are some potential state mechanisms that we could look into in terms of giving new starting businesses funding to pay for physical improvements, to pay for

2499
04:01:51,699 --> 04:01:54,741
[SPEAKER_28]: basically capital costs to operate a new business.

2500
04:01:55,502 --> 04:02:01,967
[SPEAKER_28]: It will take a lot of talking to the potential business owners, the landlords, to see why things are the way they are.

2501
04:02:02,988 --> 04:02:13,095
[SPEAKER_28]: But if we identify the problems as such, there are different mechanisms that we might be able to introduce as carrots going along with this.

2502
04:02:18,339 --> 04:02:19,440
[SPEAKER_35]: Councillor Scarapelli.

2503
04:02:19,901 --> 04:02:20,221
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2504
04:02:23,090 --> 04:02:29,052
[SPEAKER_32]: I just, and I think that I understand where the motion's, the resolution's coming from.

2505
04:02:29,112 --> 04:02:45,778
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that we just need to be cognizant in the fact that anything that we put forth that companies can look into and say, hey, well, let's take a chance in Medford, but remember if,

2506
04:02:46,917 --> 04:03:00,206
[SPEAKER_32]: it doesn't work, we're going to, you know, it's going to penalize us in a sense that, you know, being taxed and when then that would lead to what we're talking about and seeing unsavory or

2507
04:03:02,253 --> 04:03:09,956
[SPEAKER_32]: other entities entering or being just admitted into each community that would affect us in a negative way.

2508
04:03:10,016 --> 04:03:20,201
[SPEAKER_32]: So I understand the frustration because we have three master plans that we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on for Method Square and nothing's been done.

2509
04:03:20,221 --> 04:03:21,101
[SPEAKER_32]: We haven't seen anything.

2510
04:03:21,601 --> 04:03:24,963
[SPEAKER_32]: So I know that, as we said, moving forward, I think that

2511
04:03:25,583 --> 04:03:37,108
[SPEAKER_32]: the helping with some of the zoning changes and the understanding of what we're doing moving forward with the planning department to really see what works in Medford.

2512
04:03:37,188 --> 04:03:47,612
[SPEAKER_32]: I would tend to hold off on some resolution like this until we see a more of a robust plan that the city is hopefully unveiling relatively soon from what I hear.

2513
04:03:48,132 --> 04:03:48,933
[SPEAKER_32]: So, thank you.

2514
04:03:50,393 --> 04:03:51,354
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

2515
04:03:51,794 --> 04:03:54,495
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Lueb.

2516
04:03:55,452 --> 04:03:55,712
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you.

2517
04:03:55,752 --> 04:03:56,232
[SPEAKER_65]: I'll be brief.

2518
04:03:56,873 --> 04:04:02,976
[SPEAKER_65]: I thank the counselor for bringing this forward often, either in meetings or out in the community.

2519
04:04:02,996 --> 04:04:11,821
[SPEAKER_65]: When we're talking about our business districts or squares, residents ask of counselors, you know, why is XYZ business square like this?

2520
04:04:11,981 --> 04:04:13,282
[SPEAKER_65]: Why is this vacant?

2521
04:04:14,102 --> 04:04:19,265
[SPEAKER_65]: How can we get X type of business in, you know, XYZ square?

2522
04:04:20,586 --> 04:04:26,431
[SPEAKER_65]: There's a pretty obvious limit to what a city can instruct commercial landlords to do with their property.

2523
04:04:27,132 --> 04:04:39,443
[SPEAKER_65]: But this is one tool that we could consider and possibly enact to try to incentivize our squares being full and lively and they're always being business tenants and available commercial space and so I'm excited to explore it further.

2524
04:04:39,663 --> 04:04:39,944
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2525
04:04:40,885 --> 04:04:41,145
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2526
04:04:43,914 --> 04:04:49,777
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to mention for anyone watching, listening or in the chambers that this is a resolution that simply sends it to committee.

2527
04:04:50,077 --> 04:04:51,658
[SPEAKER_19]: This is an opening of the discussion.

2528
04:04:51,978 --> 04:04:57,261
[SPEAKER_19]: So if people are interested in this topic, please come to the committee meetings where this will be discussed.

2529
04:04:57,541 --> 04:05:02,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Same with the warming center, same with some of these other resolutions that were passed today and maybe passed later today.

2530
04:05:03,524 --> 04:05:06,445
[SPEAKER_19]: This is really the beginning of the discussion, certainly not the end.

2531
04:05:07,246 --> 04:05:11,088
[SPEAKER_19]: And we really encourage people to come to those committee meetings because that is where the sort of

2532
04:05:11,508 --> 04:05:16,516
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, meat and potatoes of developing laws for our city comes from.

2533
04:05:18,134 --> 04:05:18,935
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

2534
04:05:18,955 --> 04:05:19,575
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Lemming.

2535
04:05:20,036 --> 04:05:30,124
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, and I do wish my colleague were still sitting here so that I could respond to some of the points that he brought up, but he seems to have had to step out temporarily.

2536
04:05:30,204 --> 04:05:44,837
[SPEAKER_30]: But just to clarify the intent of this, I knocked on someone's door in West Medford, and this person was a business owner, owned some gyms in a couple of other areas, and she told me

2537
04:05:45,377 --> 04:05:56,068
[SPEAKER_30]: that she was trying to open up a gym in West Medford, and she had attempted to contact the landlord several different times, and the landlord wouldn't even return her phone calls.

2538
04:05:56,248 --> 04:06:08,179
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, so speculative squatting, waiting for somebody to give a good price on property, et cetera, is a strategy that landlords do.

2539
04:06:10,361 --> 04:06:15,844
[SPEAKER_30]: this now if the commercial vacancy tax were implemented successfully, it would be applied very rarely.

2540
04:06:15,924 --> 04:06:26,609
[SPEAKER_30]: The intention of something like this would be to get landlords to come to the table and work and work with the economic development director, work with different parties.

2541
04:06:27,490 --> 04:06:28,850
[SPEAKER_30]: We do need carrots.

2542
04:06:29,191 --> 04:06:35,374
[SPEAKER_30]: We also need sticks so that people so that people don't just

2543
04:06:36,494 --> 04:06:50,731
[SPEAKER_30]: own properties and get too complacent with them, but they're incentivized in different ways to own commercial storefront property, not just for their own personal gain, but also to beautify the town.

2544
04:06:51,212 --> 04:06:56,458
[SPEAKER_30]: So the intention of this, and I hope that we can hammer out something in committee that works full

2545
04:06:56,578 --> 04:07:05,605
[SPEAKER_30]: that we're trying to do, and I think that's what we're trying to do in both parties is to get something that just gets landlords to the table and understanding that, yes, they do need to rent out something.

2546
04:07:06,665 --> 04:07:08,767
[SPEAKER_30]: Suitable in the properties that they own.

2547
04:07:08,927 --> 04:07:09,287
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

2548
04:07:10,088 --> 04:07:10,828
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Mr Lemming.

2549
04:07:10,908 --> 04:07:11,589
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further comment.

2550
04:07:17,500 --> 04:07:19,881
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Callahan, are there members of the public who'd like to speak?

2551
04:07:19,922 --> 04:07:21,442
[SPEAKER_37]: I see a hand on Zoom and a hand at the podium.

2552
04:07:21,863 --> 04:07:22,663
[SPEAKER_37]: I will go to the podium.

2553
04:07:22,743 --> 04:07:23,924
[SPEAKER_37]: Name and address for the record, please.

2554
04:07:23,984 --> 04:07:24,424
[SPEAKER_36]: Sure thing.

2555
04:07:24,504 --> 04:07:26,185
[SPEAKER_36]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

2556
04:07:26,225 --> 04:07:27,386
[SPEAKER_36]: I know it's getting a broken record.

2557
04:07:28,867 --> 04:07:31,629
[SPEAKER_36]: So why I'm actually concerned about this, I'm not a business owner.

2558
04:07:32,830 --> 04:07:33,890
[SPEAKER_36]: It is a little ambiguous.

2559
04:07:33,910 --> 04:07:39,714
[SPEAKER_36]: Does it only apply to storefront properties or would it be all commercial and or industrial businesses?

2560
04:07:41,843 --> 04:07:44,787
[SPEAKER_37]: Sir, I don't think the detail has been worked out yet.

2561
04:07:44,887 --> 04:07:47,230
[SPEAKER_37]: So that's why it's being referred to committee for further discussion.

2562
04:07:47,611 --> 04:07:59,206
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm actually not sure what the legal mechanisms we have at hand under Massachusetts general law are to implement such a tax, but I think there's an intent behind it, so.

2563
04:08:00,286 --> 04:08:00,486
[SPEAKER_36]: Right.

2564
04:08:00,526 --> 04:08:01,146
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, the intent.

2565
04:08:01,166 --> 04:08:01,746
[SPEAKER_36]: I can't ask him.

2566
04:08:01,786 --> 04:08:02,387
[SPEAKER_36]: I gotta ask you.

2567
04:08:02,447 --> 04:08:02,687
[SPEAKER_36]: Sorry.

2568
04:08:02,847 --> 04:08:03,727
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2569
04:08:03,767 --> 04:08:07,188
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, Councilor Lemming has kind of stated his intent here, I think relatively clearly.

2570
04:08:07,628 --> 04:08:10,048
[SPEAKER_37]: If you want to clarify, you're welcome to.

2571
04:08:10,428 --> 04:08:13,609
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd just like to, not that I'm responding, but I'm addressing.

2572
04:08:13,629 --> 04:08:15,030
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, tell me, what's the chair?

2573
04:08:15,130 --> 04:08:16,470
[SPEAKER_30]: What do you think?

2574
04:08:16,690 --> 04:08:19,831
[SPEAKER_30]: In a completely unrelated, completely unrelated.

2575
04:08:20,131 --> 04:08:20,951
[SPEAKER_30]: What do you feel?

2576
04:08:21,231 --> 04:08:24,732
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, just just just totally unrelated to anything happening on this side of the room.

2577
04:08:24,792 --> 04:08:25,092
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't.

2578
04:08:25,752 --> 04:08:27,033
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't really understand it.

2579
04:08:27,113 --> 04:08:33,036
[SPEAKER_30]: But so the intent of this is to only apply to the commercial storefront property.

2580
04:08:33,076 --> 04:08:34,717
[SPEAKER_30]: It's just a thought that came to think.

2581
04:08:34,757 --> 04:08:36,478
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, that's a that's a question that I had.

2582
04:08:37,319 --> 04:08:38,299
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, great.

2583
04:08:38,419 --> 04:08:38,700
[SPEAKER_36]: Awesome.

2584
04:08:38,820 --> 04:08:39,040
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

2585
04:08:39,220 --> 04:08:39,580
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, sir.

2586
04:08:41,502 --> 04:08:55,888
[SPEAKER_36]: So and why I was concerned is because right across the street from my house is a vacant commercial property, 400 Riverside Ave, which I was just informed tonight that I guess is not at the moment now being considered for a migrant shelter.

2587
04:08:56,228 --> 04:08:58,949
[SPEAKER_36]: However, one of the reasons that they're in that situation

2588
04:08:59,489 --> 04:09:01,570
[SPEAKER_36]: is because it's a vacant commercial building.

2589
04:09:01,890 --> 04:09:03,670
[SPEAKER_36]: Now, why it's vacant, I couldn't tell you.

2590
04:09:04,230 --> 04:09:09,091
[SPEAKER_36]: Initially, it was supposed to be, I think, a biotech company was the intent, which to me is awesome.

2591
04:09:09,552 --> 04:09:10,472
[SPEAKER_36]: I love commercial business.

2592
04:09:10,512 --> 04:09:11,472
[SPEAKER_36]: I love private business.

2593
04:09:11,532 --> 04:09:11,712
[SPEAKER_36]: Why?

2594
04:09:11,792 --> 04:09:16,293
[SPEAKER_36]: Because it's a place for people to potentially work in their community.

2595
04:09:16,333 --> 04:09:16,933
[SPEAKER_36]: That's awesome.

2596
04:09:16,993 --> 04:09:18,854
[SPEAKER_36]: And a large space like that is great.

2597
04:09:20,014 --> 04:09:22,375
[SPEAKER_36]: I caution if we start having

2598
04:09:23,519 --> 04:09:26,822
[SPEAKER_36]: sticks, then people certainly can go out and rent out space.

2599
04:09:27,042 --> 04:09:30,285
[SPEAKER_36]: This has been demonstrated where Hey, I've got a space, let's make it a migrant shelter.

2600
04:09:30,625 --> 04:09:41,414
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, there are plenty of other avenues besides business, right to one, they'd want to get income for that building, but then also to avoid on top of that a potential tax.

2601
04:09:43,181 --> 04:09:46,062
[SPEAKER_36]: I really would like to see some sort of plan for the city.

2602
04:09:47,563 --> 04:09:48,803
[SPEAKER_36]: For instance, city of Malden, right?

2603
04:09:49,004 --> 04:09:51,164
[SPEAKER_36]: When I want to go, Justin, I'm looking at you.

2604
04:09:51,504 --> 04:09:54,406
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, when I want to go and get dim sum with my family, right?

2605
04:09:54,446 --> 04:09:57,347
[SPEAKER_36]: There's umpteen, you know, Vietnamese, Chinese restaurants, right?

2606
04:09:57,407 --> 04:10:00,148
[SPEAKER_36]: I can go to dim sum in I think three or four places, right?

2607
04:10:00,288 --> 04:10:04,670
[SPEAKER_36]: Not Songkran, I went to Songkran last weekend, right?

2608
04:10:04,730 --> 04:10:10,752
[SPEAKER_36]: Because the other one I can't, the larger one in Malden Center, right, is full, right?

2609
04:10:12,196 --> 04:10:13,657
[SPEAKER_36]: There was a plan behind that.

2610
04:10:13,737 --> 04:10:21,403
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't think it was completely random where a bunch of Asian businesses said, hey, I'm going to go put one next to the other on their own.

2611
04:10:21,443 --> 04:10:25,587
[SPEAKER_36]: I think there was some coordination by the city of Malden.

2612
04:10:26,007 --> 04:10:30,070
[SPEAKER_36]: And it's a place where young people can actually go and get entertainment.

2613
04:10:30,270 --> 04:10:31,992
[SPEAKER_36]: There really isn't a lot of that here in Medford.

2614
04:10:32,432 --> 04:10:39,376
[SPEAKER_36]: So I'd really love to see what a plan for this city is, and including these large industrial and commercial spaces that are vacant.

2615
04:10:39,856 --> 04:10:48,761
[SPEAKER_36]: So not just at the state level, I think there's a lot of local incentives that we could do to, you know, populate some of these commercial spaces in Medford.

2616
04:10:49,241 --> 04:10:51,883
[SPEAKER_36]: So my caution is be very careful with the sticks.

2617
04:10:52,263 --> 04:10:53,804
[SPEAKER_36]: They may have unintended consequences.

2618
04:10:54,324 --> 04:10:54,564
Thank you.

2619
04:10:55,285 --> 04:10:55,825
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2620
04:10:55,845 --> 04:10:57,626
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

2621
04:10:58,187 --> 04:11:00,448
[SPEAKER_37]: Matthew Page Lieberman, name and address for the record, please.

2622
04:11:01,417 --> 04:11:02,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor Mrakas, you're on mute.

2623
04:11:02,158 --> 04:11:02,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2624
04:11:02,238 --> 04:11:03,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, Matthew Page Lieberman 15 Canal Street.

2625
04:11:03,759 --> 04:11:07,342
[SPEAKER_14]: I very much support this and I appreciate that Councilor Lemming has brought this forward.

2626
04:11:07,363 --> 04:11:12,707
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember when I was looking at this last year, I was trying to come up with some carrots.

2627
04:11:13,648 --> 04:11:20,254
[SPEAKER_14]: So I very much appreciate that that discussion is already being had as far as all this alarmism that's just

2628
04:11:22,056 --> 04:11:23,918
[SPEAKER_14]: that's somewhat of a false dichotomy.

2629
04:11:24,798 --> 04:11:29,863
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I think if we go into the past, we could see how we could greatly benefit by this.

2630
04:11:30,423 --> 04:11:37,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Since pawn shops were brought up, quite a few councils back, this is over a decade ago, I guess, the council had decided

2631
04:11:38,750 --> 04:11:43,553
[SPEAKER_14]: And the mayor's administration had decided to pull all the funding away from the public access station.

2632
04:11:43,953 --> 04:11:45,054
[SPEAKER_14]: The station closed.

2633
04:11:45,754 --> 04:11:49,096
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a vacancy in Medford Square.

2634
04:11:49,497 --> 04:11:57,522
[SPEAKER_14]: And what opened in, what filled, that was a pawn shop, in which the same council would then whine about that there are pawn shops down Medford Square.

2635
04:11:59,002 --> 04:12:05,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not attacking them I don't think you know Councilor Lemus, but I mean, even if that's the case, it didn't start tonight.

2636
04:12:05,847 --> 04:12:06,767
[SPEAKER_14]: But as far as this.

2637
04:12:07,468 --> 04:12:12,391
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a point in time when we didn't have public access station we did have a spring step building.

2638
04:12:12,951 --> 04:12:17,874
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the counselors is a while back, so why can't we put the public access station in the spring step.

2639
04:12:18,274 --> 04:12:22,557
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was this, you know, why can't we why can't we why can't we and there was no innovative thinking.

2640
04:12:23,557 --> 04:12:31,600
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if anybody knows whatever happened in the spring step, but for a few years after it went under, the building was just owned, person was just sitting on it.

2641
04:12:31,880 --> 04:12:33,780
[SPEAKER_14]: They're paying very, very little taxes.

2642
04:12:34,160 --> 04:12:38,602
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they eventually sold it to a nonprofit that does work in Latin America.

2643
04:12:39,302 --> 04:12:42,923
[SPEAKER_14]: And that person who sold it made millions and millions of dollars.

2644
04:12:42,943 --> 04:12:43,883
[SPEAKER_14]: They're speculating.

2645
04:12:44,083 --> 04:12:49,105
[SPEAKER_14]: They're speculating on property that this council wanted to use for their own community, but the council couldn't figure out how to do it.

2646
04:12:50,287 --> 04:12:54,833
[SPEAKER_14]: That costs a lot of tax money for the community, that costs space that we cannot use.

2647
04:12:55,173 --> 04:12:57,677
[SPEAKER_14]: These ideas are incredibly important so that we can address that.

2648
04:12:58,077 --> 04:13:06,248
[SPEAKER_14]: And one last thing, I'm just really happy that down at City Hall, we have a new economic development director.

2649
04:13:06,628 --> 04:13:17,617
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could all be happy that I expect a lot of ideas and I'm hoping that City Hall can work with the council and we could have really, really thriving business area for the community.

2650
04:13:17,637 --> 04:13:28,867
[SPEAKER_14]: And as well as incentives, perhaps one of those incentives we could eventually talk about is some little bit of tax breaks for companies that decide to view worker cooperatives.

2651
04:13:29,107 --> 04:13:29,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2652
04:13:32,370 --> 04:13:33,110
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Matthew.

2653
04:13:34,164 --> 04:13:36,246
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Castaneda, name and address for the record, please.

2654
04:13:40,470 --> 04:13:40,930
[SPEAKER_22]: One minute?

2655
04:13:41,631 --> 04:13:45,114
[SPEAKER_22]: You must be psychic, that's all I need.

2656
04:13:47,255 --> 04:13:49,718
[SPEAKER_22]: At this hour.

2657
04:13:50,819 --> 04:13:52,040
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't have the energy to fight him.

2658
04:13:57,844 --> 04:14:03,727
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe I understand Councilor Matt's idea here, commercial vacancy tax.

2659
04:14:04,367 --> 04:14:14,953
[SPEAKER_22]: So the West Bedford Square and other locations can look fuller, like we're all selling on a full apple cart, and it looks better on a retail basis, I presume.

2660
04:14:16,854 --> 04:14:26,240
[SPEAKER_22]: And this may be an extra additional real estate tax, commercial real estate tax, on top of the existing, I presume.

2661
04:14:27,068 --> 04:14:33,651
[SPEAKER_22]: as a sort of penalty to push forward someone to rent it out, and make the city look better.

2662
04:14:33,671 --> 04:14:48,198
[SPEAKER_22]: Nate brought up 398-400 Riverside Avenue, and I believe it was Life Sciences that bought that building a year or two ago.

2663
04:14:48,578 --> 04:14:51,459
[SPEAKER_22]: My son used to work there in the machining department.

2664
04:14:55,447 --> 04:15:03,710
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm just guessing that I think the life science industry hit the fan.

2665
04:15:05,851 --> 04:15:10,113
[SPEAKER_22]: And he paid, or the entity paid $29 million, I believe, for that property.

2666
04:15:11,094 --> 04:15:17,856
[SPEAKER_22]: And his last sold, I think, I forget, and previous to that, it was sold for a dollar, probably father to son, I presume.

2667
04:15:18,657 --> 04:15:18,857
[SPEAKER_22]: So,

2668
04:15:19,949 --> 04:15:28,454
[SPEAKER_22]: And I believe the entity bought the building behind it, and also the other building behind that, which was Santini Ironworks.

2669
04:15:28,474 --> 04:15:30,675
[SPEAKER_22]: They've been in business over 100 years.

2670
04:15:30,775 --> 04:15:34,858
[SPEAKER_22]: They build steel beams to build all these bridges in Massachusetts.

2671
04:15:36,179 --> 04:15:37,920
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyways, they're all empty.

2672
04:15:37,940 --> 04:15:43,643
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course, they're not on street level in the front and center.

2673
04:15:45,124 --> 04:15:48,406
[SPEAKER_22]: But what concerns me more than all of this is this.

2674
04:15:50,458 --> 04:15:55,581
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm generally going to ask if you have an answer and be willing to answer.

2675
04:15:57,382 --> 04:16:01,524
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm more concerned if the commercial real estate values are crashing.

2676
04:16:03,845 --> 04:16:05,006
[SPEAKER_22]: That is a question.

2677
04:16:06,326 --> 04:16:07,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Are they crashing?

2678
04:16:08,167 --> 04:16:13,030
[SPEAKER_22]: Commercial real estate values, are they crashing as we speak?

2679
04:16:14,358 --> 04:16:15,879
[SPEAKER_37]: As we speak, I hope not.

2680
04:16:16,699 --> 04:16:17,059
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

2681
04:16:17,779 --> 04:16:19,420
[SPEAKER_22]: Big time, I hope not.

2682
04:16:19,660 --> 04:16:22,181
[SPEAKER_37]: But because it's pretty late.

2683
04:16:22,902 --> 04:16:25,583
[SPEAKER_37]: No, my understanding of the commercial real estate, and again, I don't.

2684
04:16:26,420 --> 04:16:31,804
[SPEAKER_37]: is that it's mainly focused the value issue is in the downtown areas of major cities like Boston.

2685
04:16:31,824 --> 04:16:47,836
[SPEAKER_37]: I have not seen, although there is the vacancy at 400 Riverside which is well noted a very large building and office with a warehouse attached but I have not, to my knowledge the assessor has not informed us of any serious devaluation of the commercial properties in the residential is going up.

2686
04:16:48,077 --> 04:16:48,977
[SPEAKER_21]: Commercial we just over 5%.

2687
04:16:49,878 --> 04:16:55,700
[SPEAKER_37]: We just finished the tax, not just, but in December, we finished the tax rate and the commercial valuation had increased significantly as well.

2688
04:16:55,720 --> 04:16:56,240
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I understand.

2689
04:16:56,280 --> 04:16:59,121
[SPEAKER_22]: My real estate tax didn't go up prop two and a half style.

2690
04:16:59,561 --> 04:17:01,882
[SPEAKER_22]: It went up like four, $500.

2691
04:17:02,462 --> 04:17:02,742
[SPEAKER_22]: Again.

2692
04:17:03,242 --> 04:17:04,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2693
04:17:04,923 --> 04:17:07,944
[SPEAKER_22]: Every year for the last three years, 400, 400, 400.

2694
04:17:11,805 --> 04:17:12,105
[SPEAKER_37]: All right.

2695
04:17:13,905 --> 04:17:15,046
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Cassidy, if there's anything.

2696
04:17:15,506 --> 04:17:18,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so what I'm concerned about is for,

2697
04:17:20,114 --> 04:17:38,084
[SPEAKER_22]: 17,000 real estate taxpayers, if the commercial real estate is going in the dumps, that means the residential real estate is gonna have a huge increase.

2698
04:17:38,204 --> 04:17:40,645
[SPEAKER_22]: It's gonna rise dramatically, big time.

2699
04:17:41,145 --> 04:17:46,128
[SPEAKER_22]: This happened before, and Mr. McGlynn had this meeting at the McGlynn School.

2700
04:17:47,671 --> 04:17:48,491
[SPEAKER_22]: I said, well, what are you talking about?

2701
04:17:48,531 --> 04:17:52,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Prop two and a half, it should only go up like 50 bucks, a hundred dollars.

2702
04:17:52,394 --> 04:17:57,897
[SPEAKER_22]: He says, Andrew, you had a full house there, high rate residential owners.

2703
04:17:58,817 --> 04:18:05,541
[SPEAKER_22]: And he says, it's gonna go up, I think it was like $700 instead of the a hundred bucks usually.

2704
04:18:06,342 --> 04:18:09,423
[SPEAKER_22]: So I said, what about prop two and a half, Mr. McGlynn, Mayor?

2705
04:18:10,324 --> 04:18:11,384
[SPEAKER_22]: He says, Andrew, good question.

2706
04:18:11,745 --> 04:18:13,866
[SPEAKER_22]: Because when the commercial real estate values go down,

2707
04:18:16,803 --> 04:18:25,607
[SPEAKER_22]: We're gonna get it big time, maybe two, three, four times more increase than normal, which is already $450 for mine last year.

2708
04:18:26,148 --> 04:18:29,669
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a scary thought for people with fixed incomes.

2709
04:18:30,890 --> 04:18:35,532
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if you know about this, if I'm factual, but you might wanna check that out.

2710
04:18:36,092 --> 04:18:37,013
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for listening.

2711
04:18:37,033 --> 04:18:37,893
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

2712
04:18:38,273 --> 04:18:39,054
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further comment?

2713
04:18:41,889 --> 04:18:49,454
[SPEAKER_37]: Hearing none, on the motion of Councilor Lemming to refer to administration and finance, seconded by Councilor Callahan earlier, maybe it was Councilor, somebody.

2714
04:18:49,855 --> 04:18:51,396
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Callahan, we have Councilor Callahan, I remembered it.

2715
04:18:51,576 --> 04:18:52,356
[SPEAKER_37]: The clerk says I was right.

2716
04:18:53,117 --> 04:18:53,777
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

2717
04:18:53,797 --> 04:18:54,578
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2718
04:18:54,698 --> 04:18:55,359
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

2719
04:18:55,679 --> 04:18:56,419
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

2720
04:18:56,439 --> 04:18:57,660
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-026, Transportation Demand Ordinance.

2721
04:19:01,141 --> 04:19:26,336
[SPEAKER_37]: Whereas the city of Medford should address high levels of traffic, whereas developers often need to make exceptions to zoning regulations to feasibly develop new buildings, and the current process of passing those to the Zoning Board of Appeals often adds unwanted uncertainty and delays to these processes, whereas a transportation demand management program automates these exceptions and puts them to the staff level by means of a points-based impacts and credits system, and whereas Everett and Boston have implemented a transportation demand management program

2722
04:19:26,856 --> 04:19:40,372
[SPEAKER_37]: to great success during development of both commercial and affordable residential property, and whereas a transportation demand management program can provide design and programming strategies that developers can employ to reduce car traffic to and from their buildings, therefore be it resolved

2723
04:19:40,848 --> 04:19:44,649
[SPEAKER_37]: that the Medford City Council adopt a transportation demand ordinance.

2724
04:19:45,090 --> 04:19:50,332
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved that this matter be referred to committee for further discussion with the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

2725
04:19:50,752 --> 04:19:58,115
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved that the members of the Committee on Planning and Permitting submit questions to the Chair, Clerk, and City staff ahead of the committee meeting scheduled for this subject.

2726
04:19:58,655 --> 04:20:09,179
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council work with the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability to evaluate the suitability of a transportation demand management program, determine the capacity of the city to implement such a program,

2727
04:20:09,819 --> 04:20:20,367
[SPEAKER_37]: and provide specific recommendations for its structure and policies, particularly with respect to the nature of the Medford specific impacts and design of its credit system.

2728
04:20:21,188 --> 04:20:29,714
[SPEAKER_37]: And I will go to you in one moment, Councilor Lemming, but I do want to note that this also came up during our planning and permitting committee meeting discussion on

2729
04:20:31,820 --> 04:20:38,043
[SPEAKER_37]: the governing agenda, and we had discussed incorporating this with our larger discussion on the zoning reform.

2730
04:20:38,763 --> 04:20:57,611
[SPEAKER_37]: Since some folks and I can't remember what was had talked to planning development sustainability staff, and they felt it would be a good compliment to the zoning to put it in and have our can those consultants work on this as well as part of the comprehensive zoning reform so I just want to let you know that, since we're able to be at the meeting, and the reports just came out recently so.

2731
04:20:58,591 --> 04:21:00,112
[SPEAKER_37]: But with that I will turn it over to you Council.

2732
04:21:01,434 --> 04:21:07,198
[SPEAKER_30]: So I was going to motion to refer this to the committee on planning and permitting.

2733
04:21:07,298 --> 04:21:07,698
[SPEAKER_30]: Perfect.

2734
04:21:09,459 --> 04:21:12,882
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of council, I'm going to refer to planning and permitting, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

2735
04:21:12,982 --> 04:21:13,862
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there further discussion?

2736
04:21:17,405 --> 04:21:19,946
[SPEAKER_37]: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?

2737
04:21:23,549 --> 04:21:25,770
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

2738
04:21:25,950 --> 04:21:26,031
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2739
04:21:26,751 --> 04:21:27,351
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

2740
04:21:27,451 --> 04:21:28,172
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

2741
04:21:28,632 --> 04:21:30,754
[SPEAKER_37]: Referred to planning and permitting.

2742
04:21:32,602 --> 04:21:34,345
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-031 offered by Councillor Starpelli.

2743
04:21:39,141 --> 04:21:45,945
[SPEAKER_37]: be it resolved that the Medford City Council ask for representative for BJ's Wholesale Club to meet with the council on construction updates and review neighborhood concerns.

2744
04:21:45,965 --> 04:21:47,085
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2745
04:21:47,166 --> 04:21:48,286
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Council President.

2746
04:21:49,527 --> 04:22:03,775
[SPEAKER_32]: For our newer members, this is a very contentious situation with the neighbors of the BJ's neighborhood, with the implementation of the new, the building of the new gas station at the corner of Middlesex Street and BJ's entrance.

2747
04:22:06,056 --> 04:22:21,529
[SPEAKER_32]: One thing that we wanted to make sure we cognizant with the neighbors being informed with everything that's happening so they are not left in the dark like they felt the last 25 years.

2748
04:22:23,030 --> 04:22:28,195
[SPEAKER_32]: And what's been happening, I guess, is the construction work

2749
04:22:29,960 --> 04:22:31,301
[SPEAKER_32]: they were setting pylons.

2750
04:22:31,542 --> 04:22:35,245
[SPEAKER_32]: And as a gym, they were hitting the pylons to set the footings.

2751
04:22:35,906 --> 04:22:40,710
[SPEAKER_32]: They shook houses and neighbors were scared to death.

2752
04:22:41,251 --> 04:22:42,252
[SPEAKER_32]: Nobody was informed.

2753
04:22:42,292 --> 04:22:43,192
[SPEAKER_32]: They let everybody know.

2754
04:22:43,212 --> 04:22:47,356
[SPEAKER_32]: I give a lot of credit to our court enforcement officers.

2755
04:22:47,857 --> 04:22:52,661
[SPEAKER_32]: They ran to the site at 630 that morning and talked to the

2756
04:22:53,382 --> 04:23:03,618
[SPEAKER_32]: project manager and he showed him some of the seismology equipment that they've had and said that it's not affecting them, but the neighbors want to have

2757
04:23:05,097 --> 04:23:08,260
[SPEAKER_32]: would like to call for meeting with the representative what we did agree with.

2758
04:23:09,021 --> 04:23:24,957
[SPEAKER_32]: I believe Council President was that there would be a representative from BJS that would be at our beck and call for our neighbors so if we can reach out to them I don't know where it fell it that it was with the building of the building department, or it was with the mayor's office I don't know who has the.

2759
04:23:25,638 --> 04:23:41,631
[SPEAKER_32]: if we can ask who that connection is and ask him to come to the next meeting, because I think some of the community members really want their voice heard, and especially the fact that they did tell the code enforcement officer they'll be doing this again.

2760
04:23:42,572 --> 04:23:46,795
[SPEAKER_32]: in a few weeks when they set the gas tanks underground.

2761
04:23:47,395 --> 04:23:52,918
[SPEAKER_32]: So there'll be more shaking and some other people had some questions with the gas lines that are there.

2762
04:23:53,439 --> 04:23:54,539
[SPEAKER_32]: How is that affecting it?

2763
04:23:54,719 --> 04:23:58,542
[SPEAKER_32]: And then we had a call that evening

2764
04:24:00,074 --> 04:24:10,501
[SPEAKER_32]: a water main burst in front of one of the residents' homes, and they wanted to see if it's attributed to that type of work that was being done.

2765
04:24:10,581 --> 04:24:23,469
[SPEAKER_32]: So I think we need to be super, super delicate with these neighbors, because as one of the members that failed them that night in voting,

2766
04:24:25,185 --> 04:24:35,792
[SPEAKER_32]: in an irresponsible manner, not knowing the laws and the rules of that night, and not having a city solicitor to protect us, it put us in a really, really bad situation.

2767
04:24:36,072 --> 04:24:39,755
[SPEAKER_32]: And whatever we can do for those neighbors, we need to follow through with.

2768
04:24:39,775 --> 04:24:40,676
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you, Mr. President.

2769
04:24:40,816 --> 04:24:41,516
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Councilor Scrivina.

2770
04:24:41,536 --> 04:24:42,337
[SPEAKER_32]: Two questions.

2771
04:24:42,557 --> 04:24:43,377
[SPEAKER_35]: When was the incident?

2772
04:24:44,178 --> 04:24:48,121
[SPEAKER_35]: I believe it was last Wednesday.

2773
04:24:48,221 --> 04:24:49,141
[SPEAKER_37]: Last Wednesday, okay.

2774
04:24:49,422 --> 04:24:51,323
[SPEAKER_33]: And last Tuesday.

2775
04:24:52,223 --> 04:24:53,504
[SPEAKER_33]: I believe the last day.

2776
04:24:53,604 --> 04:24:54,105
[SPEAKER_33]: Got it.

2777
04:24:55,219 --> 04:24:58,362
[SPEAKER_33]: was Thursday was the last day we were doing this.

2778
04:24:58,583 --> 04:25:03,548
[SPEAKER_37]: And then they said on Thursday it'll be a couple weeks we're coming back and doing this again.

2779
04:25:04,589 --> 04:25:14,339
[SPEAKER_32]: Even if by chance we can get at them, reach out to the neighbors in the immediate vicinity of 4th Street, Middlesex, just letting them know that this is what's happening.

2780
04:25:15,620 --> 04:25:16,461
[SPEAKER_32]: One resident said that

2781
04:25:25,196 --> 04:25:31,818
[SPEAKER_35]: they were afraid that the way we're shaping the house, they were afraid it would affect their foundation.

2782
04:25:31,858 --> 04:25:31,958
[SPEAKER_35]: So.

2783
04:25:33,058 --> 04:25:48,983
[SPEAKER_37]: So the further motion from Councillor Scarpelli to immediately refer this, contact the building department to contact the representative from BJ's and also to request a meeting with us, but also to request immediate notification of the surrounding neighborhood.

2784
04:25:52,105 --> 04:25:53,806
[SPEAKER_33]: All right, that's their daily activities.

2785
04:25:54,486 --> 04:25:54,666
[SPEAKER_37]: Great.

2786
04:25:54,686 --> 04:25:55,567
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Court, do you have that?

2787
04:25:55,587 --> 04:25:56,547
[SPEAKER_33]: Appreciate that.

2788
04:25:56,967 --> 04:25:57,368
[SPEAKER_37]: Most of it.

2789
04:25:59,188 --> 04:25:59,408
[SPEAKER_37]: Great.

2790
04:25:59,468 --> 04:26:02,290
[SPEAKER_37]: And we'd like that to go out as soon as possible given the timeline.

2791
04:26:02,510 --> 04:26:03,550
[SPEAKER_37]: So maybe before the records.

2792
04:26:05,471 --> 04:26:05,671
[SPEAKER_37]: Great.

2793
04:26:05,831 --> 04:26:08,853
[SPEAKER_37]: And then I will go to Councilor Callahan, Councilor Sang.

2794
04:26:08,873 --> 04:26:09,953
[SPEAKER_37]: Was there anyone over there?

2795
04:26:09,973 --> 04:26:11,054
[SPEAKER_37]: All right, Councilor Callahan.

2796
04:26:12,526 --> 04:26:26,935
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to mention that in one of the committees, perhaps you can remind me which one, we were talking about the importance of holding companies accountable for any damages that they do, or for following through on their promises of things that they've committed to.

2797
04:26:27,636 --> 04:26:35,381
[SPEAKER_19]: And I see this as part of that ongoing work, but we will be, as a city, we will be doing more to be proactive about these kinds of things.

2798
04:26:36,362 --> 04:26:38,003
[SPEAKER_37]: Absolutely, thank you.

2799
04:26:38,103 --> 04:26:38,383
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2800
04:26:39,433 --> 04:26:43,556
[SPEAKER_28]: I wanted to thank Councilor Scarpelli for introducing this resolution.

2801
04:26:43,916 --> 04:26:45,277
[SPEAKER_28]: I wanted to second it as well.

2802
04:26:46,338 --> 04:26:56,124
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli and I talked, I think on Wednesday, about how we both called the building department staff over to notify, to talk to them, get some sort of solution out.

2803
04:26:56,224 --> 04:27:00,046
[SPEAKER_28]: I think Councilor Scarpelli has really gotten to the root of everything.

2804
04:27:00,066 --> 04:27:02,528
[SPEAKER_28]: We were promised a liaison.

2805
04:27:02,688 --> 04:27:03,808
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't know who the liaison is.

2806
04:27:04,109 --> 04:27:05,669
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't been, who they report to.

2807
04:27:08,772 --> 04:27:10,954
[SPEAKER_28]: the community members deserve so much more.

2808
04:27:11,115 --> 04:27:20,786
[SPEAKER_28]: And while there are a lot of aspects of this project that we were powerless to stop, it just means that we need to do even more diligence on the other parts of this project.

2809
04:27:21,888 --> 04:27:24,451
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Councillor Seng.

2810
04:27:24,471 --> 04:27:25,272
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further discussion?

2811
04:27:28,402 --> 04:27:41,185
[SPEAKER_37]: on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as further amended by Councilor Scarpelli, to refer immediately to the building department for a response, as well as to refer to BJ's for us to have a meeting.

2812
04:27:41,225 --> 04:27:42,145
[SPEAKER_37]: Is that to committee of the whole?

2813
04:27:43,166 --> 04:27:43,946
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2814
04:27:45,886 --> 04:27:46,707
[SPEAKER_37]: Regular meeting, okay.

2815
04:27:48,407 --> 04:27:51,848
[SPEAKER_37]: So we'll send it, there's a motion to send it to building department for immediate response.

2816
04:27:52,488 --> 04:27:54,989
[SPEAKER_37]: And then also we will put it on the table.

2817
04:27:57,827 --> 04:27:59,207
[SPEAKER_37]: We'll table it, so we'll take two votes.

2818
04:27:59,707 --> 04:28:02,668
[SPEAKER_37]: And if we have it on the table, then we can take it back up in regular session.

2819
04:28:04,429 --> 04:28:16,251
[SPEAKER_37]: So on the first motion to refer the question to the building department for an immediate response and to notify abutters of further construction, that was Councilor Scarapelli, seconded by Councilor Collins.

2820
04:28:16,311 --> 04:28:17,052
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

2821
04:28:17,072 --> 04:28:17,512
[SPEAKER_37]: All right.

2822
04:28:18,072 --> 04:28:18,512
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

2823
04:28:19,792 --> 04:28:20,452
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

2824
04:28:20,973 --> 04:28:26,694
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion to table the paper, so it's on the agenda so we can take it back up at a regular meeting.

2825
04:28:28,427 --> 04:28:31,909
[SPEAKER_37]: by motion by Councillor saying seconded by Councillor Collins all those in favor.

2826

2827
04:28:52,960 --> 04:28:53,801
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Collins.

2828
04:28:55,626 --> 04:29:07,202
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, President bears this is kind of a procedural resolution to formally begin the zoning project which has been in a crescendo for longer than I've been on the council.

2829
04:29:09,443 --> 04:29:17,007
[SPEAKER_65]: Right at the end of the previous term into the start of the new one we officially the city officially brought on the zoning consultant that this council selected.

2830
04:29:17,707 --> 04:29:32,154
[SPEAKER_65]: So this is to assign the zoning project a new paper number and formally submit it to the planning and permitting committee so we can begin meeting with relevant staff and our zoning consultant to dive into that work in earnest on a motion for approval.

2831
04:29:33,513 --> 04:29:43,237
[SPEAKER_37]: The motion by Councillor Collins seconded by Councillor Scarpelli to refer the paper to the planning and permitting committee.

2832
04:29:44,037 --> 04:29:45,298
[SPEAKER_37]: All those and that's right right.

2833
04:29:46,078 --> 04:29:46,919

04:29:47,879 --> 04:29:49,200

[SPEAKER_37]: 24-034.

2836
04:29:51,463 --> 04:29:53,946
[SPEAKER_37]: This is also offered by me.

2837
04:29:54,367 --> 04:29:57,650
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm actually might ask Councilor Callahan to speak very quickly on it.

2838
04:29:57,670 --> 04:30:02,576
[SPEAKER_37]: This is just a motion that I put on because we discussed it and public works committee.

2839
04:30:02,956 --> 04:30:05,079
[SPEAKER_37]: This was around the facilities management, which I agreed to lead.

2840
04:30:05,099 --> 04:30:06,120
[SPEAKER_37]: So I'll just read it real quickly.

2841
04:30:06,560 --> 04:30:09,143
[SPEAKER_37]: And then if you, you know, you may be able to provide the context as the committee chair.

[SPEAKER_37]: 24-034 be resolved by the Bedford City Council that the Public Works and Facilities Committee request a report from the Facilities Manager containing the following information.

2843
04:30:20,049 --> 04:30:23,071
[SPEAKER_37]: One, complete inventory of city-owned properties and city-managed properties.

2844
04:30:23,611 --> 04:30:27,253
[SPEAKER_37]: Two, cost to restore each property on the above inventory to a state of good repair.

2845
04:30:27,693 --> 04:30:30,795
[SPEAKER_37]: Three, cost to maintain each property in a state of good repair once restored.

2846
04:30:31,215 --> 04:30:37,498
[SPEAKER_37]: Be it further resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite the Facilities Manager to present and discuss the above report once completed.

2847
04:30:38,433 --> 04:30:39,013
[SPEAKER_37]: Chair Callahan.

2848
04:30:39,453 --> 04:30:39,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2849
04:30:40,254 --> 04:30:53,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, yes, as I mentioned earlier today in this committee, we have discussed getting updates from the administration on roads on sidewalks and on all publicly owned buildings.

2850
04:30:53,719 --> 04:30:55,620
[SPEAKER_19]: We also have a new facilities manager.

2851
04:30:56,000 --> 04:31:01,903
[SPEAKER_19]: So we feel this is a really nice way for them to get

2852
04:31:02,563 --> 04:31:10,385
[SPEAKER_19]: themselves situated in terms of what all of the city owned buildings are, what state of repair they're in, how much might cost to repair them.

2853
04:31:10,765 --> 04:31:14,226
[SPEAKER_19]: So, this is just something that we're, you know, putting forward.

2854
04:31:15,867 --> 04:31:20,508
[SPEAKER_19]: And we think that it will both be beneficial to the city and also be beneficial to the facilities manager.

2855
04:31:22,008 --> 04:31:28,470
[SPEAKER_37]: The motion to refer the public works and facilities committee by Councilor Cohen second by Councilor saying any further discussion.

2856
04:31:28,490 --> 04:31:31,611
[SPEAKER_37]: Members of the public yes Mr Gasconetti.

2857
04:31:36,468 --> 04:31:43,471
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this is great that Councilor Beasley brought this forward because maintenance is key, I've said many times.

2858
04:31:47,754 --> 04:31:56,779
[SPEAKER_22]: And furthermore, the McGlynn School, I'm not sure if anyone here knows it, but it's been leaking for years.

2859
04:31:58,299 --> 04:32:01,001
[SPEAKER_22]: It's only a 23-year-old building, I think.

2860
04:32:03,203 --> 04:32:08,568
[SPEAKER_22]: That's when I asked for the bike path to be built from those schools to Memphis Square.

2861
04:32:09,068 --> 04:32:10,570
[SPEAKER_22]: And finally, it looks like it's getting done.

2862
04:32:10,890 --> 04:32:12,071
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm impressed so far.

2863
04:32:13,312 --> 04:32:18,197
[SPEAKER_22]: But the point is, there's over 7,000 wood frame homes in this city.

2864
04:32:18,597 --> 04:32:19,458
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm guesstimating.

2865
04:32:20,699 --> 04:32:24,282
[SPEAKER_22]: And it seems like they're all still standing.

2866
04:32:25,248 --> 04:32:36,834
[SPEAKER_22]: And most of the people back 70, 80, 90, 100 years ago when they were built, most of them were legal immigrants, and they didn't make much cash, salary-wise.

2867
04:32:37,755 --> 04:32:41,377
[SPEAKER_22]: But yet, they kept them afloat, and they're still standing.

2868
04:32:42,117 --> 04:32:50,902
[SPEAKER_22]: So it hurts me to think, I remember when they built the Method Library in 59, and it seems like 63 years later,

2869
04:32:53,419 --> 04:32:59,242
[SPEAKER_22]: A brick and mortar building is condemned and they had to rebuild it for 30 million plus two from Bloomberg.

2870
04:32:59,763 --> 04:33:11,369
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you see the configuration of the two or three roofs, it's like an invitation for snow and leaks to occur, in my humble opinion.

2871
04:33:12,150 --> 04:33:13,170
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not a contractor.

2872
04:33:14,171 --> 04:33:16,773
[SPEAKER_22]: So the police station, same thing.

2873
04:33:16,853 --> 04:33:20,635
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember being a customer there back in 63 when that was built, I believe.

2874
04:33:27,226 --> 04:33:30,129
[SPEAKER_22]: And I told my friends, it was their fault.

2875
04:33:33,012 --> 04:33:35,014
[SPEAKER_22]: They weren't quick on their feet like I was.

2876
04:33:35,935 --> 04:33:39,218
[SPEAKER_57]: So they ratted me out.

2877
04:33:39,258 --> 04:33:41,480
[SPEAKER_22]: That was five, six years before that.

2878
04:33:43,202 --> 04:33:49,308
[SPEAKER_22]: So what I'm trying to say is, if I cut out the Milwaukee,

2879
04:33:52,247 --> 04:33:59,332
[SPEAKER_22]: brick and mortar buildings owned by the city of Method, our most precious assets are not being taken care of.

2880
04:33:59,833 --> 04:34:05,797
[SPEAKER_22]: And we don't need no debt overrides, a prop two and a half overrides, debt exclusions.

2881
04:34:06,598 --> 04:34:06,858
Thank you.

2882
04:34:07,298 --> 04:34:09,040
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

2883
04:34:10,401 --> 04:34:10,861
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Merritt.

2884
04:34:11,241 --> 04:34:12,382
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll make it quick.

2885
04:34:12,603 --> 04:34:13,703
[SPEAKER_36]: Just one question.

2886
04:34:14,004 --> 04:34:14,984
[SPEAKER_36]: Sorry, I can't ask you.

2887
04:34:15,565 --> 04:34:16,946
[SPEAKER_36]: Ask me and I will.

2888
04:34:17,346 --> 04:34:17,626
[SPEAKER_36]: Sure thing.

2889
04:34:19,907 --> 04:34:31,755
[SPEAKER_36]: What about considering if the buildings can't be fixed, maybe it's worth selling the property as a revenue generator for the city, if it makes sense, as a possibility, right?

2890
04:34:31,795 --> 04:34:47,465
[SPEAKER_36]: Versus if something's really bad and you'd have to tear it down and rebuild it, and you don't know what the city would wanna do with it, maybe it's in a location that's desirable to put something else, be it residential, commercial, industrial, I have no idea, but just as an option four in your list.

2891
04:34:47,975 --> 04:34:49,976
[SPEAKER_37]: Sure, yeah, and I'll go to Councilor Kellyanne in just a second.

2892
04:34:50,417 --> 04:34:57,742
[SPEAKER_37]: I think we'd certainly be open to the assessment that it's not worth the existing city capacity to restore it to a state of good repair.

2893
04:34:57,802 --> 04:35:00,103
[SPEAKER_37]: So I hear you there, Councilor Kellyanne.

2894
04:35:00,163 --> 04:35:04,506
[SPEAKER_19]: This resolution really is all about just getting the information that we need to make decisions like that in the future.

2895
04:35:04,526 --> 04:35:04,686
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2896
04:35:06,087 --> 04:35:16,154
[SPEAKER_37]: Personally, I don't think we should sell public land, but maybe a land swap of some kind could be good, but that's neither here nor there until it is.

2897
04:35:18,655 --> 04:35:19,635
[SPEAKER_37]: Any further discussion?

2898
04:35:21,756 --> 04:35:22,436
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion.

2899
04:35:22,456 --> 04:35:23,536
[SPEAKER_59]: Second.

2900
04:35:25,416 --> 04:35:27,116
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Callahan seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2901
04:35:27,136 --> 04:35:27,937
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

2902
04:35:27,957 --> 04:35:28,577
[SPEAKER_37]: Aye.

2903
04:35:28,657 --> 04:35:29,237
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

2904
04:35:29,777 --> 04:35:30,577
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

2905
04:35:30,837 --> 04:35:31,257
[SPEAKER_65]: President Pierce?

2906
04:35:33,037 --> 04:35:36,398
[SPEAKER_37]: Public Works and Facilities, yes.

2907
04:35:36,418 --> 04:35:38,978
[SPEAKER_37]: 24036, Vice President Collins, who has asked to say something.

2908
04:35:39,038 --> 04:35:40,019
[SPEAKER_37]: Vice President Collins, yes.

2909
04:35:40,699 --> 04:35:41,019
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you.

2910
04:35:41,059 --> 04:35:41,979
[SPEAKER_65]: I have two things.

2911
04:35:42,479 --> 04:35:45,199
[SPEAKER_65]: One, I'd like to table 24036 to our next regularly scheduled meeting.

2912
04:35:50,086 --> 04:35:51,629
[SPEAKER_65]: is, why is that funny?

2913
04:35:52,050 --> 04:35:52,511
[SPEAKER_59]: I don't know.

2914
04:35:52,531 --> 04:35:58,504
[SPEAKER_65]: Okay, here's what, here's something that will not endear me to my fellow counselors.

2915
04:36:00,751 --> 04:36:01,231
[SPEAKER_65]: Sorry, George.

2916
04:36:02,752 --> 04:36:05,553
[SPEAKER_65]: I'm going to invoke rule 28, motion to reconsider 24021.

2917
04:36:06,553 --> 04:36:09,535
[SPEAKER_65]: That's the plant medicine resolution that we voted on.

2918
04:36:10,135 --> 04:36:11,996
[SPEAKER_65]: That's the plant medicine resolution that we voted on.

2919
04:36:12,756 --> 04:36:20,119
[SPEAKER_65]: Previously in the evening, we took a vote to send it to committee as a member of the person who voted on the prevailing side.

2920
04:36:20,139 --> 04:36:23,920
[SPEAKER_65]: I have the right to ask that the vote be reconsidered.

2921
04:36:25,101 --> 04:36:30,123
[SPEAKER_65]: And I'd like to, I don't know if it'll change the outcome, but the vote that I cast differed from

2922
04:36:31,482 --> 04:36:32,282
[SPEAKER_37]: what I plan to support.

2923
04:36:32,302 --> 04:36:35,404
[SPEAKER_37]: I just have to take these in order before you continue to explain the motion.

2924
04:36:35,944 --> 04:36:42,548
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councillor Collins to table 24-036 until the next regular meeting, and you'd like it to appear on the regular agenda.

2925
04:36:43,449 --> 04:36:48,091
[SPEAKER_37]: So it'll be back on under motions, orders and resolutions at our next regular meeting.

2926
04:36:48,171 --> 04:36:52,113
[SPEAKER_37]: On the motion of Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Gallihan.

2927
04:36:52,133 --> 04:36:52,794
[SPEAKER_37]: All those in favor?

2928
04:36:53,794 --> 04:36:54,234
[SPEAKER_37]: Opposed?

2929
04:36:54,314 --> 04:36:55,015
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion passes.

2930
04:36:58,066 --> 04:37:00,869
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Keohane, you're invoking rule 28 to reconsider paper 24-021?

2931
04:37:00,909 --> 04:37:02,730
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, I am.

2932
04:37:03,251 --> 04:37:04,312
[SPEAKER_37]: All right, give me one second.

2933
04:37:04,352 --> 04:37:07,214
[SPEAKER_37]: I just wanna double check.

2934
04:37:07,815 --> 04:37:13,420
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm sure you're reading exactly what I'm about to read, and it's gonna say exactly the same thing, but I'm gonna look anyway.

2935
04:37:18,685 --> 04:37:19,486
[SPEAKER_37]: After vote is taken.

2936
04:37:22,554 --> 04:37:34,064
[SPEAKER_37]: Whereas Councillor Collins was on the prevailing side of the vote, which was to refer paper 24-021 regarding plant medicine to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

2937
04:37:34,965 --> 04:37:36,026
[SPEAKER_37]: The motion to reconsider.

2938
04:37:36,046 --> 04:37:43,712
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, you can just do that.

2939
04:37:43,932 --> 04:37:45,153
[SPEAKER_37]: So that's back on the table.

2940
04:37:45,173 --> 04:37:45,914
[SPEAKER_37]: We're talking about it again.

2941
04:37:45,934 --> 04:37:45,954
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-021.

2942
04:37:50,319 --> 04:37:52,280
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm just gonna read it, I'm not gonna read it, sorry.

2943
04:37:52,300 --> 04:37:55,823
[SPEAKER_37]: Do we have to vote to reconsider?

2944
04:37:59,525 --> 04:38:00,206
[SPEAKER_37]: Hold on a second.

2945
04:38:17,515 --> 04:38:19,416
[SPEAKER_37]: No, I don't have to vote on the motion to reconsider.

2946
04:38:19,436 --> 04:38:21,437
[SPEAKER_37]: It's an automatic invocation, it's a motion.

2947
04:38:22,317 --> 04:38:26,959
[SPEAKER_37]: So it is under reconsideration, at least that's how I read it, unless someone wants to overrule the chair.

2948
04:38:26,979 --> 04:38:32,281
[SPEAKER_37]: 24-021, resolution to support adult access and education for plant medicine.

2949
04:38:32,341 --> 04:38:35,843
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Collins, if you would like to explain your motion to reconsider.

2950
04:38:36,834 --> 04:38:37,734
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you, President Behrs.

2951
04:38:37,774 --> 04:38:41,996
[SPEAKER_65]: And I do apologize to my fellow counselors for bringing this back to the table, especially at this late hour.

2952
04:38:43,217 --> 04:38:50,340
[SPEAKER_65]: But to leave the meeting in good conscience, going into this meeting, having studied the resolution, having talked to advocates for it, I went in planning to support its passage tonight.

2953
04:38:51,141 --> 04:38:57,524
[SPEAKER_65]: My vote to send it to committee, I think, was more of my personal vote on that.

2954
04:38:58,564 --> 04:39:03,870
[SPEAKER_65]: was more out of going with the flow than what was really in my plan or what was in my heart for this evening.

2955
04:39:04,231 --> 04:39:07,414
[SPEAKER_65]: So I don't know if it will change the outcome, but I personally

2956
04:39:08,666 --> 04:39:22,732
[SPEAKER_65]: would like to retake that vote and have another opportunity to cast my vote for whether we should pass it symbolically tonight as an endorsement of the decriminalization policy, or if it is still the will of the council to send it to committee for further discussion.

2957
04:39:23,332 --> 04:39:24,233
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there a motion on the floor?

2958
04:39:24,893 --> 04:39:26,053
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion to move the question.

2959
04:39:26,394 --> 04:39:29,395
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion to move the... To pass it.

2960
04:39:29,595 --> 04:39:31,976
[SPEAKER_37]: Motion for approval by Councilor Lemming, seconded by?

2961
04:39:31,996 --> 04:39:32,356
[SPEAKER_37]: Second.

2962
04:39:32,796 --> 04:39:34,157
[SPEAKER_37]: Seconded by Councilor Collins.

2963
04:39:36,445 --> 04:39:37,729
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a motion to approve 24-021.

2964
04:39:43,794 --> 04:39:45,175
[SPEAKER_37]: you can make a motion to amend.

2965
04:39:45,415 --> 04:39:47,656
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm gonna take the motions in order.

2966
04:39:48,737 --> 04:39:49,497
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, what's the motion?

2967
04:39:49,837 --> 04:39:54,019
[SPEAKER_28]: A motion to amend to approve and have the police chief report back.

2968
04:39:54,479 --> 04:40:07,025
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, Councilor Lemming, are you comfortable with amending your motion to approve to also include that the police chief will report back to the council on the recommendation of the resolution?

2969
04:40:08,366 --> 04:40:10,867
[SPEAKER_30]: So would the, wait, so to be clear,

2970
04:40:12,679 --> 04:40:16,960
[SPEAKER_30]: we would pass it and then the police chief would come back with his recommendations.

2971
04:40:17,520 --> 04:40:19,080
[SPEAKER_37]: His response to the resolution.

2972
04:40:19,440 --> 04:40:20,420
[SPEAKER_30]: Sure, that's fine.

2973
04:40:20,540 --> 04:40:41,344
[SPEAKER_37]: All right, so seeing that everyone's cool with that, or at least the two motioners, the two petitioners seem to be acceptable on the motion to approve the paper 24-021, a resolution supporting adult access and education for plant medicine as amended by councilor saying to request a response from the chief of police to the resolution.

2974
04:40:42,364 --> 04:40:43,444
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there anything beyond that?

2975
04:40:44,465 --> 04:40:45,725
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

2976
04:40:45,805 --> 04:40:46,846
[SPEAKER_37]: Is there a discussion on the motion?

2977
04:40:48,406 --> 04:40:48,947
[SPEAKER_37]: Councilor Kellyanne.

2978
04:40:48,967 --> 04:40:51,908
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just gonna say, I worked on this.

2979
04:40:52,348 --> 04:40:53,168
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in support of this.

2980
04:40:54,909 --> 04:41:02,372
[SPEAKER_19]: I do, as a general rule, I think councilors should take time to understand everything in everything that we pass.

2981
