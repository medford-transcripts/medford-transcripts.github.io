    <p>[SPEAKER_75]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=828.717s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=829.517s">My</a>  name is Judy Lonergan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=831.158s">I</a>  live at 34 Lincoln Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=833.839s">I'd</a>  like to give you a brief history of what happened and why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=838.742s">In</a>  1999, a group of Medford women decided that they wanted to run a function, an event, to recognize the fact that the song Jingle Bells was written in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=848.246s">We</a>  decided that it would be a free event that anyone in the community could attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=853.249s">We</a>  had plans in place, but we had no place to hold it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=859.193s">I</a>  went to see Mayor McGlynn, who at the time I was not really that friendly with. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=863.295s">I</a>  explained our problem to him, and I asked him if he could think of a place. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=867.738s">He</a>  brought me into the council chamber and said that we could have it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=871.4s">That's</a>  how it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=872.801s">This</a>  festival started in 1999 when Community Family purchased the historical old railroad station on Washington Street from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=881.829s">My</a>  husband, John, was on the board at that time and suggested that Community Family become the beneficiary of this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=889.115s">Community</a>  Family is the first licensed adult care facility in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=894.139s">Before</a>  they purchased the railroad station, the program was held in the basement of the West Medford Baptist Church for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=900.722s">This</a>  agency provides direct service care to those who have been diagnosed with severe Alzheimer's. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=906.964s">They</a>  provide medically-based services along with transportation activities and meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=912.467s">I</a>  don't need to tell you that services like this keep our loved ones, friends, and neighbors aging in their homes where they want to be, not institutionalized in a skilled nursing home facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=924.275s">There</a>  are three community family centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=926.657s">One</a>  is in Everett, one is in Melrose, and the Medford Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=929.939s">The</a>  Medford Center caters to those affected with highest level of Alzheimer's. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=935.644s">Clients</a>  leave to go either to a nursing home or they die. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=939.587s">The</a>  festival has grown in size every year, and over these 25 years, we have been able to donate almost $450,000 due to the generosity of sponsors, ads, donors, and chances. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=952.901s">They</a>  use the proceeds to assist with the purchase of vans, construct a new kitchen, develop a large outdoor space where the clients can spend time in nice weather, and help to renovate the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=965.167s">This</a>  event is free to any family to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=968.629s">If</a>  they want to purchase chances, they can buy 20 for $5, and then the prices go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=973.971s">This</a>  year, a mother came in with two children, and she bought chances with four single dollars and four quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=981.775s">But</a>  it gave her the opportunity to have her children be involved in an event for Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=987.04s">And</a>  this is the biggest event in Medford for this Christmas holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=991.364s">And</a>  if someone came in and they couldn't even afford $5, they would be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=995.728s">We</a>  would do whatever we could to help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=997.97s">Our</a>  volunteers decorate City Hall for the month of December, which is still out there, and the city uses our decorations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1006.016s">The</a>  festival starts on Wednesday night for the lighting of the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1009.659s">Afterwards,</a>  everyone is invited inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1011.94s">These</a>  women work for seven solid days on the set, setting up, decorating, and cleaning up on Monday after summer volunteers in City Hall spend 40 hours <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1025.794s">having</a>  this function be extremely successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1029.817s">The</a>  festival does not cost the city one cent other than the use of this chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1035.06s">We</a>  have purchased the tablecloth as well as paying for the rental of all the tables and chairs and paying for the janitorial services. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1042.886s">It</a>  has recently been brought to our attention that some members of this city council do not want us to use City Hall any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1049.91s">One</a>  feels that it is disruptive and one feels that we are not inclusive enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1054.173s">We</a>  have had <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1056.024s">Members,</a>  we have been always on display for chances. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1059.065s">We</a>  have included every church, the Buddhist Center, the Royal House, Chevalier, most recently the new library as part of the tours on Saturday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1067.908s">This</a>  year, Barbara Rothstein, who is an active member of the temple, had her home on the tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1073.63s">What</a>  reason does this council have to desire that the event be discontinued? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1078.652s">We</a>  hope that you will reconsider and allow this community event to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1083.013s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1084.074s">Thank</a>  you, Judy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1090.609s">I'm</a>  going to recognize Councilor Scarpelli in just a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1095.532s">Could</a>  you not hear Judy? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1096.333s">I</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1102.017s">Just</a>  want to say, you know, I don't think the intent of this council whatsoever is to move or cancel the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1106.78s">I</a>  can't speak for where those rumors have come from, but they have not come from this council or any official statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1114.232s">Well,</a>  they are not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1116.213s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1116.993s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1117.353s">So</a>  I know that, first of all, I care very deeply for a lot of our members. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1123.756s">I</a>  respect you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1124.936s">And</a>  I will tell you that having deep conversations with my fellow Councilors, that's not the intent of this Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1131.599s">we'll</a>  do everything that needs to be done to make sure that event comes through every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1137.665s">It's</a>  too important for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1139.327s">In</a>  today's society, where we lack a true sense of community at times, that event brings everybody together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1145.433s">So</a>  I don't know where where that might have come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1147.915s">But</a>  I will tell you, we will work hard together as a board to make sure that that's not something that's going to ever be forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1153.981s">And</a>  and we understand how hard you work. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1156.463s">And</a>  I think that comes that evening that happens a lot of miscommunication and a lot of misunderstanding what was coming from the administration, the council, and your organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1166.911s">So</a>  I think all it says is really having an open line of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1171.455s">I</a>  know that Judy's working really hard with the mayor's office to set up a meeting with different clergy and different churches. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1177.179s">I</a>  know that the council president would probably love to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1179.881s">to</a>  make sure that we're all together to make sure that this is an all-inclusive and a true celebration the way that you intended for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1187.248s">I</a>  think that you know I brought my kids to the event when they were babies and it's something that to this day they still remember the Christmas trees and not for what what <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1197.558s">what</a>  the symbol of it but what it meant for the city and that was really unifying us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1201.841s">So</a>  I think that we so appreciate everything you do and I appreciate that you even had to come up here and share what you had to because there might have been some negative <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1216.89s">I'm</a>  glad you were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1219.031s">I'm</a>  glad that we got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1220.012s">We</a>  had a chance to speak, get the word out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1222.933s">And</a>  really, I think most importantly, is rally around as a council as an organization as a city to do more of these type of functions, because they're so important to what we're doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1234.877s">I</a>  mean, you want to talk about we have a room full of people that want to that are looking for true inclusion and peace and happiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1240.659s">And</a>  I think that you're you're <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1243.539s">You're</a>  the originators. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1245.34s">You've</a>  been doing this before people were looking for where to look, where there's peace and love and happiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1251.765s">So</a>  you are, in my eyes, the cornerstone of what we all should fight for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1259.85s">So</a>  again, I'm sorry that there was any negative words that came out in discussions, but rest assured, I've talked to Council President <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1270.267s">We're</a>  gonna work very hard to make sure this doesn't change. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1273.027s">And</a>  now, I think that it's out there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1276.348s">I</a>  would love to see so many other of our churches and our synagogues and our different affiliations and partners throughout the community really rally around this event so we can use this as a true teaching moment for everybody and really celebrate that amazing event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1294.511s">I</a>  know that still hundreds of kids show up every year <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1299.632s">And</a>  you didn't mention how much money goes out, Mrs. Lonergan, but I know you're talking to the hundreds of thousands that were raised and that were distributed to so many families that needed it and so many organizations that need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1313.824s">And</a>  I think it's to the point now, we don't have enough room for the people that want to donate Christmas trees so they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1320.71s">And</a>  what's the intent of the tree? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1322.392s">People</a>  don't realize you can hold what? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1325.074s">more</a>  prizes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1326.214s">So</a>  you get more money and more donations that can come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1329.015s">So</a>  that's one of the intents for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1330.756s">I</a>  think that people didn't realize how important that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1333.537s">It's</a>  really just a mechanism to really stress the importance of gathering funds to support different initiatives throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1342.94s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1345.573s">You</a>  know how I feel about all of you personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1347.454s">I've</a>  known all of you probably my whole life, and I think that I'm proud to call you my friend, but I will tell you, as a council, I didn't hear, I haven't heard one negative thing moving forward with anything we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1359.279s">I</a>  think we're all one team, making sure that we're gonna spread this love. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1362.961s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1364.482s">Yes,</a>  and I know how many gifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1366.383s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Sanford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1369.226s">I</a>  know how many gifts go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1370.387s">I</a>  know I was a youth volunteer at the Buddy Cohalent Center myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1374.411s">My</a>  family has faced the tragedy of Alzheimer's, so I understand how important it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1378.835s">If</a>  there's any meetings that I can represent the council at, I'd be happy to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1382.979s">From</a>  here on out, we're gonna keep it to two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1384.86s">Judy</a>  had a petition, so she went in advance, but name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Loretta Tusa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1388.143s">Loretta</a>  Tusa, 45 Metcalf Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1391.066s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli for your words. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1394.309s">and</a>  to the council, who I hope is gonna support us wholeheartedly in this effort that's been going on for over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1400.671s">I</a>  have a little speech, won't take long, couple of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1404.113s">I'm</a>  a retired 37-year educator of the Medford Public Schools, former board member of Medford Health Matters, and a member of the Jingle Bell Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1414.997s">I</a>  would like to address the use of City Hall to host the festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1420.675s">It</a>  is the Medford residents who through their federal taxes, state taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, local food tax, and community taxes fund the operation of the House of the People City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1439.727s">And</a>  on a final note, the festival committee here has, over the last 20 plus years, given their heart, souls, time, and money to raise thousands of dollars to fund the community center to provide a warm and welcoming place for seniors with special needs to spend their time comfortably. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1460.124s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity to express my thoughts.</p>

    <p>[Angela Sperduto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1476.189s">Hello,</a>  everybody.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1477.03s">Hi,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Angela Sperduto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1478.791s">My</a>  name is Angela Sperduto, 27 Memorial Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1481.752s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1485.494s">Hello,</a>  my name is Angela Sperduto. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1488.176s">I've</a>  been a member of the Jingle Bell Festival for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1493.019s">My</a>  dad, Cosmo Sperduto, was a client at the Community Family Adult Day Health Center for almost a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1501.504s">The</a>  love I have for my father could not be put into words. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1506.175s">He</a>  was the most important person in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1510.936s">He</a>  had late stage advanced Alzheimer's. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1513.497s">He</a>  lost his motor skills and ability to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1517.338s">Alzheimer's</a>  disease is the most common type of dementia that not only affects your loved one, it affects the whole entire family. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1527.02s">As</a>  the primary caregiver of my dad, the physical and mental demands became very overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1533.697s">To</a>  see my dad, who was so strong mentally and physically, become a shell of himself was more than most can handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1543.068s">Not</a>  knowing where to turn for help, I was recommended to look into the community family for help and care for my dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1551.783s">Having</a>  to work every day as well as providing 24-hour care for my dad, this center was my savior. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1560.828s">I</a>  refused to put my dad into a long-term facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1564.67s">They</a>  educated me on the disease and the progression of its long-term daily effects to the brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1571.053s">As</a>  they provided knowledge on the financial and legal issues that are involved with the Alzheimer's patient. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1578.578s">He</a>  needed 100%, 24-hour care, never to be left alone, as he would be a danger to himself, and most importantly, other people.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1587.994s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1588.154s">Peduto,</a>  you have 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[Angela Sperduto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1589.636s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1590.959s">Anyway,</a>  the staff displayed a genuine concern for my dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1595.761s">They</a>  called me many times with issues regarding my dad's health. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1600.543s">Every</a>  time they were concerned about his health, they prevented more health issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1604.725s">I</a>  could not have asked for more kindness and professionalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1607.906s">They</a>  truly became a second family to me, showing me love and emotional support until his passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1613.996s">I</a>  want to thank them from the bottom of my heart, as I will always be a member of this festival, and I want to give back as long as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1620.923s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1621.884s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1635.218s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1635.538s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1636.619s">You</a>  have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_48]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1638.016s">My</a>  name is Val Camilio. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1640.097s">I</a>  live in 223 Lawrence Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1642.479s">I'm</a>  here in support of the continuation of the Jingle Bell Festival held here every year at Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1650.184s">It's</a>  difficult to take care of someone who suffers from dementia or Alzheimer's. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1655.867s">It</a>  is not an ordinary 24-hour day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1658.429s">It</a>  is a 24-hour day of worry, stress, and what's about to come for them and the caregiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1664.733s">People</a>  who suffer from these disorders require constant supervision, you know preparation personal hygiene care and more families look for any outside support, help and services for their loved ones, much like a child daycare program, but they can be very costly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1683.94s">My</a>  mom was 78 years old when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1688.025s">As</a>  much as that family tried to care for her needs, it became impossible and difficult as we had our own families to care for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1695.874s">At</a>  the time my dad was 88 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1698.857s">And</a>  he did the best he could preparing nutritious meals and trying to keep her occupied and entertained. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1704.219s">It</a>  soon became too much of a test for him as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1707.18s">We</a>  looked for services in the area, and finally found community family in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1712.202s">It</a>  was a relief to find temporary help allowing me and my family members, some comfort during our busy working days. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1722.852s">We</a>  took mom to visit community family, and the administrator was welcoming, kind, warm, and attentive to my mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1729.379s">My</a>  apprehensive mother looked at me and whispered, all these people are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1736.006s">In</a>  reality, the people were both young and old, men and women, rich and poor, and of mixed ethnicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1744.695s">So</a>  you see, Alzheimer's does not discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1748.817s">On</a>  her first day, the administrator knew my mom loved to cook. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1752.539s">So</a>  she took my mom into the kitchen and asked her if she would like to prepare lunch for the guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1757.541s">My</a>  mom was eager to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1759.602s">She</a>  became a community family member for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1763.085s">She</a>  started three days a week and eventually went to four. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1766.247s">My</a>  mom actually thought she was working there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1768.768s">The</a>  staff at the facility were kind, patient and caring to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1772.951s">They</a>  also had a nurse on staff, and beyond administering medications, she would even give baths for those who needed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1780.882s">They</a>  had wonderful days planned with activities, games, singing songs, exercise, nutritious lunch and snacks, and they celebrated everyone's birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1789.485s">In</a>  addition to the wonderful care provided to our community, family provided transportation to and from the facility if it was needed, with a van that was purchased from monies received from the Jingle Bell Festival.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1802.651s">Ma'am,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1803.391s">Your</a>  time is up, but your message has been heard.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_48]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1805.612s">I'm</a>  sorry?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1806.372s">Your</a>  time is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1807.052s">We</a>  have a two-minute limit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_48]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1809.096s">I</a>  only have another minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1811.297s">My</a>  mom thrived there and my dad and other family members had a safe place for mom to go for daycare. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1823.183s">I</a>  can show attention to all the people who came there for services. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1828.185s">They</a>  never got frustrated and was beyond anything I could ever imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1834.005s">The</a>  community family always went over and above what they needed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1838.626s">It</a>  is the type of care that you would never receive anywhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1842.187s">They</a>  are truly devoted to these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1845.108s">I</a>  am proud to have helped raise money for the community family through the Jingle Bell Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1850.709s">I</a>  would never be able to repay them for the care they gave my mom in the five years she spent there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1857.813s">We</a>  are so fortunate to have wonderful caring facility in Medford to help our community with respite care and have a safe place to bring our loved ones.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1866.348s">Thank</a>  you ma'am.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1875.97s">Councilor</a>  Tseng I'll be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1877.391s">I</a>  think it's really important to clarify that this council has no plans has had no plans and we'll have no plans to cancel the jingle ball event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1886.077s">I</a>  believe that this arises out of a misunderstanding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1890.774s">of</a>  miscommunication that happened a few months ago, but having spoken to some, at least the councillors I've spoken to, there are no plans to cancel this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1900.157s">And</a>  the council supports the mission of the Jingle Bell event as well.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2252.735s">Resolution</a>  to support adult access and education for plant medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2258.539s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Leming and Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2261.866s">Whereas</a>  the so-called war on drugs has led to unnecessary penalization, arrest, and incarceration of vulnerable people, particularly people of color and people of limited financial means, rather than prioritizing harm reduction policies to treat drug abuse as an issue of public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2275.131s">And</a>  whereas ethniogenic plants and fungi such as psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca, ibogaine, and mescaline-containing cacti have been shown by peer-reviewed studies and indigenous practice to be beneficial, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2286.335s">for</a>  treating spiritual trauma, addiction, PTSD, depression, terminal illness, anxiety, and cluster headaches, among other conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2293.044s">And</a>  whereas, on average, we lose one of our neighbors in the Commonwealth to opioid overdose every week, as thousands of people we love struggle with addictions that ethniogenic plant medicine has been shown to alleviate, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2304.296s">And</a>  whereas seven Massachusetts communities, Somerville, Cambridge, Northampton, Easthampton, Amherst, Salem, and Provincetown, and nearly two dozen cities nationwide have passed measures directing an end to arrests for growing and sharing these plant medicines, embracing their inferred constitutional right to regulate public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2318.46s">That</a>  is outlined in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2319.62s">Department</a>  of Justice's Cole Memorandum that permitted localities to deprioritize enforcement of cannabis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2324.981s">Oh</a>  boy, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hereby maintains the use and possession of all controlled substances should be understood first and primarily as an issue of public health and by all town entities and that no Medford employees should use any should emanate to city resources, city entities and city resources to assist in enforcement of laws criminalizing personal controlled substance possession. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2347.54s">Is</a>  there a motion to waive the remainder of the reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2349.804s">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2350.605s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2354.132s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2354.833s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2355.554s">Councilor</a>  Leming?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2357.503s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2358.764s">So</a>  this is, I'd like to thank the council for considering this very long text. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2365.952s">Essentially,</a>  this is just a resolution to decriminalize plant-based medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2371.539s">You</a>  know, these are not the same as opioids that cause a public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2378.426s">They</a>  are non-addictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2379.887s">They</a>  have been shown to be able to treat things like PTSD and addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2386.01s">This</a>  has already been done, as it said, by seven other Massachusetts communities, so we would be the eighth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2391.954s">This</a>  is meant to first encourage local law enforcement to deprioritize this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2400.138s">I</a>  don't believe that this council has the authority to outright <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2403.08s">to</a>  decriminalize it, and it is meant to support the state-level initiative to do just that, which is currently being sponsored in the Massachusetts Senate by Senator Jalen. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2415.391s">Just</a>  to clarify one part of this and offer a little bit of context is in the part of the reading that was waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2423.799s">This</a>  resolution calls that the Bedford City Council, sorry, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2428.543s">to</a>  do well so okay so basically there are there's just for a little bit of context there are a couple of different ways to decriminalize this one of them and another avenue that is currently being pursued is a signature collection method which would basically create a an unelected commission that would add its own that if passed in massachusetts would add its own regulation to these plant medicines this has already been passed in <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2458.291s">Oregon,</a>  and long story short, it's made the price of these plant medicines go between $1,000 and $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2465.316s">So</a>  doing things this way through elected representatives would just help to decriminalize it and not create this sort of artificial price. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2476.683s">So</a>  I think that this is a very important step forward to creating a nuanced and science-backed drug policy in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2485.549s">And</a>  I'd like to thank this council for considering it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2488.971s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2489.872s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2492.194s">Councilor</a>  Leming spoke quite well on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2495.297s">Really,</a>  this is a, remember, this is a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2497.579s">This</a>  is not an ordinance that we are passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2499.661s">This</a>  is a statement of the views of the council on not prioritizing our law enforcement to spend resources, to arrest and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2515.336s">you</a>  know, sent for incarceration, people who simply have possession of such controlled substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2524.26s">So</a>  given that and what Councilor Leming said, I believe this resolution is a fairly reasonable state and there are many other cities that have passed something very similar.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2537.276s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2538.377s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2539.879s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Villescaz. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2541.06s">I</a>  think any time that we present a resolution or an ordinance that has a level of detail that we talk about law enforcement, I think it'd be prudent for us to maybe send this to subcommittee, invite the chief or someone in his stead to give us their input as our, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2559.361s">the</a>  city of Medford to make sure that what we're voting on has the best interests of our police department and our safety of our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2570.956s">I</a>  think that it would be, um, it would be, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2577.119s">a</a>  prudent solution to move this forward to get a little bit more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2582.982s">What</a>  I read is, you know, it's information that's gathered, but I'd like to get more information before I would vote on this and really get the input of the chief where it's mentioned a few times that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2598.035s">the</a>  ramifications through the police department and getting their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2601.876s">So</a>  I would recommend that we would move this to one of the subcommittees, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2608.518s">I</a>  said a motion to refer to the public health and community safety.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2617.8s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2618.161s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2618.361s">With</a>  the representative from the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2620.801s">Seconded</a>  by councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2621.902s">Is</a>  there further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2622.902s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2627.961s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2629.622s">I</a>  appreciate my fellow Councilors for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2631.723s">I</a>  certainly will be comfortable supporting the resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2633.945s">I</a>  think it's also fine to discuss it more with relevant stakeholders and community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2639.008s">For</a>  me, putting aside the medical and therapeutic uses associated with psychedelic plants, it's certainly not my belief that drug-related arrests and prosecutions should be a law enforcement priority, except when it comes to <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2650.535s">some</a>  of the things specifically exempted in the resolution, such as unauthorized commercial sale, distribution of minors, driving under the influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2659.978s">Recent</a>  history, I mean, not so recent history has shown us that criminalization of substances does not meaningfully advance public health and public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2667.56s">At</a>  the same time, this is a holistic issue, so I look forward to future discussion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2671.482s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2828.038s">And</a>  I apologize that we, I've been working on an RFP to fix the sound system in this room for several months, and I'm very frustrated that it hasn't been done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2835.204s">We</a>  do have hearing assistance devices available, and I believe the City Messenger and our videographer can provide those to assist if the sound quality in the room is not sufficient for people who are in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2849.555s">No</a>  hands on Zoom, so we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2851.217s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3326.24s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3327.361s">As</a>  a co sponsor of this, it clearly is important to me that we do consider the spirit of what we're trying to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3337.052s">But</a>  I also want to mention that this is a fairly long resolution, and it includes a couple of state <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3344.076s">recommendations</a>  about state policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3346.437s">And</a>  I want to ensure that other Councilors have had the time to consider those policies and to consider the entire text. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3355.122s">And</a>  that I also mentioned this because I am the first in the alphabet, which means that I have to state what I'm going to do first. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3364.307s">And</a>  that's simply to say to my fellow Councilors that I would definitely respect people's desires to have time and committee <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3373.001s">to</a>  understand the issue more. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3374.723s">And</a>  I will, as a co-sponsor, make sure that this does move through committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3379.968s">But</a>  I just want to state that I'd love to hear from other Councilors in terms of whether sending it to committee is something that you would prefer.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3389.215s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3390.016s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3391.737s">It's</a>  my reading of this resolution that it essentially is a recommendation for the city, for the police department on a policy, but it's not creating policy of our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3405.226s">And</a>  so I'd be fine voting with it tonight, especially seeing that the police chief will still be the final arbiter of what the policy is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3415.213s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3415.993s">We've</a>  talked a lot about the science of it, I'm not going to delve into that too deep, but I would be okay with this going either way tonight, either sending it to committee or to are just voting it out tonight, because it is essentially a. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3431.675s">It's</a>  a rung above symbolic, but it's not us imposing policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3439.341s">I</a>  think it's to the public comment earlier, I just looked up what the definitions of distribution are in these laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3448.208s">They</a>  don't involve what we were afraid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3451.851s">They</a>  don't involve sale or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3454.653s">And</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3457.483s">I</a>  or I guess I guess Yeah, so I would be happy with this going going forward, but I defer to the sponsors on the motion unless there's further comment.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3668.075s">and</a>  have continued to attack Israeli civilians, injuring hundreds in rocket attacks since October 7th, and whereas since those horrific attacks, the ongoing Israeli military campaign and blockade has created a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions in Gaza, and whereas since October 7th, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3684.042s">The</a>  Israeli military has killed over 26,000 Palestinians in Gaza, injured over 62,000, and more than 85% of all Gaza residents have been displaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3692.069s">And</a>  whereas the ongoing military campaign has had a horrific toll on civilians in Gaza, with UNICEF describing the Gaza Strip as the, quote, world's most dangerous place to be a child, and reporting that 40% of all deaths in Gaza have been deaths of children, and whereas the Israeli military has launched more than 22,000 airstrikes at Gaza, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3710.586s">resulting</a>  in the destruction of over 70% of all homes and schools, and most of its civilian infrastructure, including electricity, communications, water, sewer, and sanitation systems, with the World Health Organization reporting that all Gazan hospitals have been destroyed or seriously damaged, exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, and <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3729.321s">whereas</a>  the near total siege on Gaza has prevented the delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid, and whereas the World Food Program has reported that all 2.2 million people in Gaza are facing crisis levels of food insecurity, that one in four Gazans is facing catastrophic hunger, and that without an end to bombardment and resumption of humanitarian aid, famine will spread quickly across the population and <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3753.408s">whereas</a>  humanitarian organizations report that the Israeli military kills an average of 250 Palestinians each day, almost all civilians, and that these deaths are a direct result of airstrikes, the blockade of basic food and medical aid, and the destruction of hospitals and basic shelter, which are war crimes, and whereas Hamas continues to hold over 100 Israeli civilians hostage and target Israeli civilians, which are war crimes, and whereas Israel continues to detain thousands of Palestinians who have never been charged with or convicted of a crime, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3782.945s">including</a>  scores of children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3784.926s">And</a>  whereas on October 26, 2023, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for an immediate, durable, and sustained humanitarian truce between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in Gaza, and numerous international humanitarian organizations have similarly called for a sustained ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3802.258s">And</a>  whereas the previous ceasefire from November 24 to November 30, 2023, allowed for the release of some Israeli hostages, some Palestinian detainees, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3811.804s">and</a>  allowed emergency aid and fuel to enter Gaza and whereas the history of Israel and Palestine since 1948 includes systemic displacement of Palestinians and occupation of Palestine, the imposition of illegal blockades upon and denial of basic civil and human rights to Palestinian civilians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3827.68s">ongoing</a>  and escalating terrorism and violent attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, and extremist violence aimed at Israeli civilians, and whereas many members of the Medford community are suffering from trauma, grief, shock, and fear compounded by recent <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3843.439s">increased</a>  incidence of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Palestinian racism, both nationally and locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3850.181s">And</a>  whereas members of the Medford community, including Palestinians and Jews, are speaking out for peace in Israel and Palestine, and in support of a permanent bilateral ceasefire and a return of all hostages, innocent detainees, and political prisoners, now, therefore, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3865.885s">Be</a>  it resolved by the Medford City Council that we support an enduring bilateral ceasefire in Israel and Gaza and the immediate return of all hostages, innocent detainees, and political prisoners. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3877.329s">Be</a>  it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we unequivocally condemn all violence against civilians, including the attacks by Hamas on October 7, 2023 against Israeli civilians, the Israeli military campaign against Gaza that continues to unleash disproportionate violence against Palestinian civilians, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3894.415s">attacks</a>  by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, and all attacks by all parties against civilians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3902.518s">Be</a>  it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we support the lifting of the blockade and the uninhibited provision of life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3911.161s">Be</a>  it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3913.422s">We</a>  affirm the inalienable right of all people to live in peace, free from fear of harm and prejudice, be it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we unequivocally condemn all xenophobic violence, attacks, and rhetoric, and affirm the inalienable right of all people to know safety and acceptance, regardless of their religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, or skin color. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3934.798s">be</a>  it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we urge the Biden administration, the United States Senate, and the United States Congress to exert the full extent of their power, influence, and funding to bring about an enduring ceasefire, the uninhibited provision of humanitarian aid, and the release of all hostages and detained innocents, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3952.318s">Be</a>  it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be sent to each member of Medford's federal delegation, that's Senator Warren, Senator Markey, and Representative Clark, and to President Biden, urging them to use their power and influence to bring about a sustained and enduring ceasefire so as to protect and honor all human life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3971.242s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3974.002s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3974.863s">Thank</a>  you for reading all of that into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3978.929s">I</a>  want to briefly speak to why I'm putting forth an amended resolution from what was submitted to be incorporated in the Council's formal agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3986.771s">After</a>  I put forward the resolution last week, I was contacted by many constituents who urged me to reconsider the language before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4003.382s">With</a>  an issue such as this, it is critical to speak with as much clarity and precision as possible, even when and especially when it's uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4012.568s">I</a>  was called upon to amend this resolution to more authentically and faithfully represent the harms endured on both sides of the Israel and Palestinian border. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4021.173s">In</a>  addition, while the ultimate ask of this resolution is for an immediate and enduring bilateral ceasefire, I was also called upon to not let the historical context go unsaid and unacknowledged. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4031.539s">I</a>  thank everybody who got in touch with me from the original request to put forward a ceasefire resolution to the many people who gave me feedback and worked with me to improve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4051.323s">Despite</a>  my note about updating the language of this resolution, I also want to put forth a disclaimer that I don't believe I personally have the ability or maybe it's simply not possible to talk about this issue in a way that does not leave one group or another at risk of feeling diminished or blamed or impoverished. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4075.506s">If</a>  you are feeling that way, please blame me or blame the insufficiency of language to talk about an issue that is breaking all of our hearts and has been breaking all of our hearts for decades, and most especially many people in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4086.413s">And</a>  thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4088.559s">I</a>  want to speak briefly to why I elected to bring this resolution forward, apart from the fact that I was contacted by constituents to do so, that being the ultimate reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4100.527s">I</a>  am Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4101.648s">My</a>  ancestors on both sides came to America in the early 1900s because Eastern Europe wasn't safe for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4107.772s">My</a>  last name is Collins because my great-grandfather couldn't get a job with a Jewish last name. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4112.956s">My</a>  family knows that anti-Semitism is real and it is dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4118.976s">I</a>  believe that past hardship and trauma and persecution are never valid nor meaningful, but we can seek to make past trauma and hardship, we can seek to get something out of that if we put that experience in service of other people and stand in solidarity with other people who are also facing oppression and persecution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4141.232s">Now</a>  we see a right-wing government using the grief of Jewish people, like me, and the name of Jewish people to justify the destruction of an entire civilian population in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4150.798s">There</a>  are no words that can adequately capture this horror, pain, and injustice. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4155.141s">This</a>  resolution is long, but the ask is simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4158.023s">Our</a>  US government is deeply entwined with and invested in the Israeli military. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4162.006s">Our</a>  federal leaders have the influence, the power, and the purse strings to hasten an end to the killing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4168.75s">This</a>  issue is painful and divisive, more for some than for others. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4173.974s">But</a>  ultimately, this resolution is about safety, and I believe that should unify us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4179.117s">Marginalizing</a>  Palestinians, whether legally, physically, or in the media, advances no one's safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4185.701s">It's</a>  simply not right, and I would defy anyone to tell me that the mass murder, displacement, and destruction in Gaza will leave Israeli residents more safe from violent extremism. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4197.17s">Some</a>  people would question the validity of city-level resolutions about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4201.295s">To</a>  me, this is a Medford issue because Medford residents are invested in the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4206.262s">And</a>  while the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4207.323s">government</a>  condones the killing and sends unrestricted military aid to Israel, communities right here in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4212.971s">are</a>  starved for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4214.933s">If</a>  you attend any average city council meeting, what you'll hear us talk about ultimately is how there aren't enough public dollars to pay for resident services, fully funded schools, affordable housing, road safety, and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4227.556s">Meanwhile,</a>  our federal leaders authorized billions to help bomb kids in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4233.198s">I</a>  find that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4243.174s">I</a>  find it unfathomable on a human level, and I find it infuriating as a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4248.686s">Those</a>  dollars should be promoting wellness at home, not destruction abroad. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4253.419s">I</a>  hope that we can find unity in the unacceptability of this oppression and this loss of life, and in demanding an immediate and lasting de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4263.565s">I</a>  hope that we as a council can join the groundswell of city councils, amplifying their residents' calls for ceasefire, and add Medford's voice to the chorus for peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4272.99s">I</a>  hope we can find unity in diminishing no one's suffering and trauma, and in demanding safety and peace for all.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4310.791s">Because</a>  I work for a 501C3 organization that takes a position on a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza, among other things, I have filed a disclosure form with the city clerk, but I have been advised by the State Ethics Commission that I am able to vote on this issue.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4326.301s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4330.904s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4333.385s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4336.374s">I'd</a>  just like to say that many members of this community, people I consider to be very close friends have encouraged me to vote in favor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4345.062s">What</a>  I will say is that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4356.093s">I'm</a>  an officer in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4357.915s">military.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4358.596s">The</a>  Hatch Act does technically allow reservists to comment on these sorts of matters when not on active duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4367.846s">It</a>  is my belief, however, that even though I do commend my colleague for writing a <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4376.909s">very</a>  thorough and very well said resolution that voting on this resolution would adversely impact my ability to do my job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4388.717s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there, and I will be abstaining from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4398.444s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4400.54s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4401.862s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Villescaz and thank you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4405.506s">I</a>  think that I'm going to <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4409.465s">bring</a>  us back to a few sessions ago, and I made a commitment that for one councilor, I would stand with the policy that I will not vote on any national or international vote that comes to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4424.937s">I</a>  think we have so many issues right now within our community that I think our focus really needs to be on the measures of Medford right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4435.946s">I</a>  know that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4439.088s">the</a>  information will go out there that Councilor Scott Peli doesn't believe in this, or Councilor Scott Peli's belief is X or Y. The truth of the matter is, everybody is in favor of peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4450.401s">And</a>  I've had the opportunity to talk to so many <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4453.965s">great</a>  residents of method both from Palestine that are in support of this resolution, that are from that are Jewish that are supporting this resolution, and a Jewish residents that are totally against this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4471.4s">So</a>  I found that this one resolution gave me the opportunity to listen to some amazing people that she had some amazing thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4482.709s">And</a>  what I find it more important is that we have an avenue to bring some very, very educated people that have their own thought process to come together and unite them, and then come back with a message that I will personally work with, that we can contact the people that have contacted me, bring my friends together, and then send a message together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4506.981s">Because</a>  one thing that I've realized and something Medford doesn't need, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4511.189s">This</a>  is another piece dividing our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4513.651s">So</a>  no matter what anybody votes or how they vote tonight, there's going to be a half that's really separated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4521.058s">And</a>  that's not from my opinion, my own opinion, my beliefs, but this is my opinion from the multiple phone calls I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4529.486s">I</a>  did receive messages from people that asked me that if they could, if I could read something into the record or a statement to the record, and I on both sides, I, I recommend a recommended my Palestinian friends to send any messages they wanted me to read on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4547.712s">I've</a>  asked my friends on who feel that this isn't a resolution that they feel safe on that I would share the information show. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4555.735s">So</a>  if, if you would allow me I have</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4559.096s">I</a>  have, if you wouldn't mind, I just have some as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4562.304s">Could</a>  we let councilor speak and then can we come back to the reading into the record piece? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4565.531s">Is</a>  that okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4568.476s">It's</a>  uncharacteristic, Councilor Bears, that usually we... I'd just like to treat all public participation the same, if that's all right.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4575.14s">This</a>  is a public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4576.481s">This</a>  is the council speaking as part of the record.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4581.164s">Are</a>  you reading other people's statements in the record?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4582.845s">I</a>  am. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4582.965s">All</a>  right, I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4583.686s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4583.886s">So</a>  if you'd like to do that, I'll... If that's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4585.767s">I'll</a>  yield to you and then come back.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4587.048s">I</a>  have some from others. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4588.889s">If</a>  I could just go to... Let every councilor say their piece, then I'll go right back to you after councilors have spoken to read other statements into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4595.193s">You'll</a>  be first in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4597.389s">Councilor</a>  say.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4598.23s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4600.052s">Um,</a>  my focus as a city councilor in this job as a candidate who ran for city council who first ran for city council, um, just over two years ago, um, who started the campaign almost three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4614.445s">The</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4616.581s">biggest</a>  issue going up at going in my brain at that time was fighting to make sure that our residents that all of our residents felt safe and not only just safe, but welcome and included and engaged in our city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4631.588s">I</a>  grew up, obviously, my <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4635.749s">My</a>  skin color makes me look different from other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4637.77s">I</a>  grew up oftentimes as someone who felt excluded, as someone who didn't necessarily feel completely represented in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4648.776s">And</a>  for me, that was a driving factor to get involved in government and to make sure that we built a local government that reflected the desires of its people, that the <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4658.2s">push</a>  for equity and for justice, and to make sure that that push was reflected in our actions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4666.123s">And</a>  at the end of the day, to make sure that all of our residents feel safe and welcome here in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4673.125s">It's</a>  with that spirit that after the horrifying attacks on October 7th, I reached out to Jewish, Arab, and Muslim community leaders to make sure that, at least from my office, that they <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4687.029s">felt</a>  safe, that they felt welcomed and included, and knowing that there were growing incidents of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic and xenophobic attacks and incidents in this community to make sure that they have the resources they need and needed and still need to feel safe and welcome in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4707.968s">Um,</a>  as situations on the ground, um, have developed, uh, more residents of various backgrounds, including a large number of, uh, Jewish, personally very close Jewish friends begged me as a city councilor to vote yes, um, when a ceasefire resolution, if a ceasefire resolution came across my desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4728.535s">And</a>  through those discussions, I realized that not voting, not doing anything is, um, an action in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4738.28s">And</a>  so, and for so many of our residents, they need to see that their elected officials align with the values that we espouse as candidates and that we espouse as politicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4761.295s">When</a>  I look at this resolution, I look at the first and last lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4766.877s">recognizing</a>  and celebrating the sanctity, the preciousness, the equality of human life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4774.325s">Looking</a>  at the last line cites the core purpose of this resolution as to reaffirm that we stand with protecting and honoring all human life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4787.588s">This</a>  is undoubtedly a difficult situation, but I really do commend Councilor Collins for keeping the focus in this resolution on the sanctity of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4799.56s">for</a>  keeping the focus of this resolution through hope on equality, bringing in stakeholders from many, many different parts of this community, hearing opposition to different drafts of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4812.165s">I</a>  know the vice president has worked really, really hard on a product that best captures that inclusive energy and spirit that we want to see in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4823.28s">For</a>  me, again, the local aspect of this is that, is just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4828.925s">It</a>  is the quality of letting our residents know that we stand with these values. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4835.842s">when</a>  I also think about why this resolution is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4841.187s">I</a>  realize that, you know, while this isn't necessarily, you know, obviously, I don't think anyone is under the illusion that we ourselves as Medford City Council is going to stop war in the Middle East, but <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4854.358s">I</a>  do think that many, many folks, many residents, neighbors, activists have felt disillusioned, disheartened, and in despair after various and numerous attempts to reach out to federal and state level stakeholders on this issue, people with influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4871.474s">And</a>  they're coming to the Medford City Council, they're coming to City Hall tonight, because they recognize that there aren't many avenues left. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4880.475s">We</a>  are, in many ways, one of the last stops that people are going to, to ask us, to beg us to help them get their message across to our federal electeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4894.848s">I</a>  think we really need to try, in any case, be it Gaza, be it a local issue about a park or a street or a sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4904.354s">We</a>  as elected officials, as the Medford City Council, have a responsibility to amplify the community's desires to speak to federal elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4913.6s">That's</a>  our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4914.621s">We</a>  do it on different issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4916.322s">We</a>  reach out to Congress people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4917.703s">We</a>  reach out to state reps to help us resolve things. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4921.626s">This</a>  is our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4924.907s">I,</a>  you know, I think there's a crisis of faith in democracy when people don't feel hurt by their elected officials, and I think we need to work to restore that faith in our country.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4937.23s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4946.332s">Any</a>  further comments by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4951.724s">Seeing</a>  none, as the president and the chair, I will not be, I will be voting, but I will not be participating in debate as I move us through this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4958.969s">And</a>  I hope everyone can appreciate that that is my role. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4962.612s">Now</a>  we will go to hear from, if anyone would like to read anything into the record, I know we have Councilor Scarpelli has a number of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4968.976s">I</a>  have an item. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4969.557s">Are</a>  there any other councilors would like to read any statements into the record that they received? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4974.639s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, and I appreciate your deference to me.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4977.341s">No,</a>  I completely understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4979.222s">This</a>  is a topic that I respect from all my fellow councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4983.325s">I</a>  think that anything that you've said, I don't think any of us disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4988.468s">I</a>  think it's very important that everybody understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4990.209s">We</a>  have a council that is very cordial and respectful, and this isn't an easy and a simple issue that has a simple outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4999.676s">But</a>  I will tell you, as Councilor Sagan mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5004.939s">the</a>  communication I received from our constituents that felt the need that were scared to come out tonight, that really wanted to understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5018.123s">what</a>  is being said so far, they're feeling the opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5021.804s">They</a>  feel that with this motion moving forward, that it hurts what we have in our community of bringing people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5031.787s">So</a>  again, not my view, I'm explaining what residents have reached out to me and asked that I share. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5040.569s">One</a>  person that I respect, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5043.69s">A</a>  former teacher of mine, who has been living in Israel for many, many years now, reached out with a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5051.753s">He</a>  said, while nobody here wants to see any more death, people must remember that on October 6, there was a ceasefire agreement in effect that was holding well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5061.355s">However,</a>  on October 7, Hamas terrorists violated the ceasefire and attacked <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5066.417s">kibbutzim,</a>  villages, and a music festival murdering 1,200 Israeli, including not only Jews, but Muslims, Christians, Jews, Americans, Thais, Russians, British, among others. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5079.049s">While</a>  mutilating many bodies, burning some alive in ovens, and raping countless women, there were people ranging in ages eight to 87 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5089.667s">There</a>  was among over 230 kidnapped people that were brought back to Gaza, of which 136 are still being held. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5096.532s">If</a>  they are alive, we still have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5099.074s">Since</a>  Hamas has not allowed the IRC to visit the hostages, we have no idea how any of them are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5106.099s">A</a>  ceasefire resolution only gives confidence to Hamas that they are winning the war in the West and makes it harder to get the hostages, the bodies, back. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5114.986s">Plus,</a>  Israel will not accept a ceasefire unless includes a return of all hostages and bodies as well as leadership of Hamas being sent into exile to a country that will accept them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5126.871s">Unless</a>  those conditions happen, it doesn't matter how many cities or states or countries vote for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5132.493s">Israel</a>  will not accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5133.653s">So</a>  I think that whether you believe in it or not, these are messages that come from families of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5140.876s">We</a>  have another that was sent <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5143.257s">that</a>  wanted to reach out in the statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5146.418s">Forgive</a>  me that they're longer, but to members of the council and those in attendance, thank you for listening to this statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5153.1s">The</a>  months since 10-7 have been extremely tight trying for the Jewish community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5158.981s">We</a>  experienced a predominantly attack on the brothers and sisters solely because they are Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5165.413s">It</a>  brings back haunting memories of when this was commonplace not more than a century ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5171.538s">We</a>  are slaughtered not for the military advantage, not for political maneuvering, but because we're Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5176.922s">The</a>  only thing different today is that there is a country and an army that will push back and defend us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5182.247s">In</a>  the World War Two during the programs in Russia, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5185.089s">and</a>  the inquisitions across Liberia and in ups or uprisings like Farhoud in Middle East, we were defenseless. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5194.915s">But</a>  today in the first time in 2000 years, we have the ability to stand up and push back against the Jew haters that are attempting to alienate us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5203.641s">In</a>  the latest, we have experienced rapidly rising anti-Semitism, including here at home, with genocide chants down the street at Harvard, and anti-Zionists who, by definition, call the destruction of the Jewish homeland in Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5219.673s">We</a>  hear louder and louder every day the warning signals that Jews are no longer safe, coupled with the thousands upon thousands who celebrated our deaths on 10-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5228.26s">We</a>  are scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5230.862s">We</a>  cannot trust our local officials to stand against anti-Semitism, and we cannot trust our fellow citizens when we see them marching in the streets calling for more Jewish deaths. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5241.109s">Our</a>  concerns are not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5242.67s">Our</a>  safety is ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5244.711s">And</a>  this ceasefire resolution before you is a symbol that you are telling Jews to once again not push back, not fight for the survival, but lay down and take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5253.517s">That</a>  is what we hear when there are calls for Israel to call off the war against those who started this in the Battle of 10-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5261.442s">During</a>  World War II, we did not have a ceasefire for Nazis or Imperial Japan, despite the horrific amount of civilian death in the war and aggression the Axis started. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5270.865s">There</a>  was no ceasefire against Al Qaeda 9-11, and the worldwide Jewish community will not abide the ceasefire with the Hamas. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5277.988s">The</a>  common thread here is that there cannot be a ceasefire <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5281.229s">with</a>  groups whose entire reason for existence is ideological mass murder. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5286.73s">The</a>  only type of viable, long-term, and durable ceasefire is one where Hamas' war-making ability is destroyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5294.612s">Only</a>  then can Israeli lives and security of the Palestinians can be free from an Islamic dictatorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5301.393s">A</a>  ceasefire that leaves Hamas in place is a banned <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5305.194s">band-aid</a>  upon a cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5307.195s">It</a>  may save some lives in the short term, but guarantees more war, death, and destruction down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5313.616s">Hamas</a>  officials have promised to repeat the genocide of 10-7 again and again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5320.498s">Israel</a>  will be forced to continue to defend their citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5323.419s">Hamas</a>  will continue to try to kill Jews and hide behind their own Gaza subjects. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5329.101s">Jews,</a>  Arabs, Israelis, Palestinians, all will suffer until Hamas is no longer <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5334.542s">poses</a>  a threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5335.703s">And</a>  even after this, there is those who are still not swayed by the existential fear of Jewish constituents face. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5345.351s">I</a>  leave you with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5346.472s">Why</a>  is the council taking such a stand? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5349.134s">What</a>  is it about <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5350.495s">this</a>  war that is exceptionally different from all the other conflicts raging in the world, that makes it worth splitting a community further alienated, an already fearful minority, just to issue a statement about a handful of these beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5365.859s">How</a>  does this serve the interests of Medford residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5368.581s">And</a>  what message do you think will be heard for your actions today? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5373.384s">Thank</a>  you for listening to these concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5377.887s">So</a>  I will tell you, I've shared some amazing conversations from my Palestinian friends that it was a great understanding, something that I will never understand the, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5393.797s">the</a>  feelings that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5395.158s">I</a>  could never, no one here, unless you're Palestinian or Jewish in Israel and understand the situation we're going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5402.546s">So</a>  to minimize that, to minimize that, to minimize that would be disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5407.37s">But</a>  I will tell you that there is <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5416.599s">a</a>  ground movement moving forward that I will gladly move forward with, with my friends that I've now worked with, that bringing our Palestinian people and our Jewish residents to find a clear message that we can work together, that could present to this community, that it's more of a unified front. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5437.437s">And</a>  I think that that's what's important here in Medford today. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5441.661s">So</a>  again, whether it's popular or not, that's not my intent here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5448.227s">I</a>  have a strong belief in what I believe in when it comes to issues dealing with national, international issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5459.496s">I'm</a>  gonna abstain from any votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5461.478s">I</a>  will not vote for anything on any agenda that comes forth in this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5465.722s">I've</a>  done this in the past, and I'll do this moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5469.4s">That</a>  doesn't mean George Scarpelli doesn't believe in peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5472.923s">That</a>  doesn't mean that George Scarpelli doesn't believe that there isn't a way to unify our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5481.489s">But</a>  this is who I am, who my residents have requested their information be spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5491.017s">And</a>  I thank you for the time, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5495.04s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5496.321s">I'm</a>  going to read a statement that we received a call here at City Hall from a resident who has to make a statement in support of <a href="../resolutions/24-035.pdf"><font color="green">24-035</font></a> resolution in support of a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5508.009s">The</a>  caller is a Medford resident of over 15 years, married to an Arab American and mother of two children are also of Arab heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5515.034s">She</a>  supports the resolution filed by Vice President Collins for a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5519.737s">She</a>  has friends directly impacted who have lost dozens and dozens of family members <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5523.8s">a</a>  ceasefire is what's best for all people and would prevent wider escalation of wars and suffering in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5529.044s">The</a>  caller asked to remain anonymous for the safety of her family. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5534.229s">So</a>  we've heard a number of opinions tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5537.571s">We</a>  are going to hear opinions that we disagree with tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5540.994s">Votes</a>  are going to be taken that we may disagree with tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5544.037s">I</a>  deeply ask everyone to respect <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5547.452s">the</a>  rules of the council, my role as chair, and we're gonna try to hear from everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5552.218s">We're</a>  gonna go, there's no end point. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5553.86s">I've</a>  been here till 2.30 in the morning before. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5556.443s">Maybe</a>  we'll be here tonight if everyone in this room wants to speak for two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5560.408s">But</a>  when we speak, we're going to listen for two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5564.253s">I'm</a>  going to give a 30 second warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5566.877s">And</a>  I really please ask folks not to interrupt or try to disrupt the speech of anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5572.423s">Again,</a>  we are going to hear things that we disagree with tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5575.305s">I</a>  stand here very often and hear things I disagree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5578.188s">And</a>  I do try my very, very best not to react. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5582.352s">And</a>  I ask just that we hold that level of respect for everyone as they speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5587.622s">We'll</a>  hear from everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5588.683s">A</a>  vote on some motion will be taken on this resolution, and that will be how this process goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5595.247s">So</a>  as I said, we can have folks line up here at the podium if they would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5600.791s">We</a>  will alternate also with Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5602.812s">If</a>  people are on Zoom, please raise your hand on Zoom, and we will go back and forth between the podium and Zoom as hands are raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5611.278s">Everyone</a>  will have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5613.159s">I</a>  will begin a timer after I ask folks to introduce themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5617.862s">If</a>  you would like to just provide the city that you live in versus your street address, you may do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5624.648s">But</a>  I will ask for name and city of residence and address if you are comfortable sharing your address. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5630.593s">It</a>  looks like we're gonna have a lot of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5632.114s">So</a>  again, as I did before, and as you all saw the role of this chair, I'm going to ask you to stop at two minutes and I really please ask that you respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5643.204s">We</a>  cool with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5645.663s">All</a>  right, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5647.144s">And</a>  we're gonna start at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5649.526s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5650.968s">We'll</a>  make sure we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5652.389s">And</a>  you will have two minutes once you've said your name.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_64]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5954.635s">I</a>  have been a resident of Medford for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5958.098s">My</a>  children went to Medford public schools and graduated from high school there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5962.921s">I</a>  was born in Lebanon and came to Tufts University as a graduate student. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5968.024s">I</a>  have been a U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5968.805s">citizen</a>  for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5971.204s">In</a>  1982, I planned to visit my parents with my infant, but was urged not to travel because within four days of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the Israeli army had occupied my village, a Christian village halfway into Lebanon, near Beirut, surrounded by Muslim and Druze villages, where we lived in harmony with our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5992.448s">The</a>  Israelis came to divide and conquer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5995.649s">Daily,</a>  they would bomb the neighboring villages and would tell people in my village to hide, expecting retaliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6003.156s">My</a>  brothers fled with their families, and we were scattered in different parts of the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6008.901s">My</a>  uncle stayed with my parents to take care of them, but he died during one of the Israeli bombings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6015.427s">My</a>  parents had to leave home, taking very little with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6019.37s">Every</a>  home in our village was destroyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6021.19s">Our</a>  home was hit by 18 rockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6024.471s">My</a>  mother died, never saw her home again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6027.392s">My</a>  mother-in-law died alone in a nursing home, having been displaced twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6032.913s">Once</a>  in 1948 from her home in Jerusalem, Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6037.214s">And</a>  then, they were brutally forced by the Israelis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6041.815s">My</a>  children... 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6044.136s">My</a>  children grew up yearning for family presence in their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6048.219s">Israel</a>  destroyed entire neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, and shelters in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6054.204s">What</a>  happened to us cannot be compared to this horrific assault on Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6060.589s">My</a>  son-in-law's family was seeking shelter in the church in Gaza City.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_63]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6132.116s">My</a>  name is Suhad Zinda. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6133.617s">I</a>  live on 5 Essex, Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6135.939s">I've</a>  been a resident of Medford for almost 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6139.362s">My</a>  family lives in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6141.464s">I</a>  came to Medford from Gaza City. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6146.288s">I</a>  came here as an undergrad, I came here as a student, and now I'm an educator on Tufts Medford campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6155.862s">I</a>  chose Medford to raise my family because of its diverse community and because that's where I felt safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6164.405s">It</a>  was my first time living in a city, experiencing a city without cement walls, without barbed wires or checkpoints. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6175.856s">I</a>  saw trophies here after the Israeli government tightened its siege on Gaza in 2001, which revoked my movement permit to return to Gaza and be with my family ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6191.423s">I</a>  was living only an hour and 40 minutes away as an undergrad at Birzeit University in the West Bank when they did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6200.588s">It</a>  took me four full years in order to bring my family to the United States and reunite with them on a different continent. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6208.673s">It</a>  was easier than seeing them and being with my family who live an hour and 40 minutes away from me, only because they were in Gaza, only because of our ethnicity.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6219.959s">You</a>  have 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_63]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6221.425s">Okay,</a>  today, the rest of my family members, my extended family members, remain in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6229.472s">14</a>  of them are still under, are beneath the rubble of their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6233.996s">Since</a>  October 18th, 127 of my family members, of the Zindah family members, remain missing until today. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6243.525s">The</a>  last I heard from them was the 10th of December. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6246.888s">Sorry,</a>  I'm out of breath.</p>

    <p>[Epstein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6689.921s">I</a>  am an American Jew and no stranger to Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6693.607s">I</a>  have relatives there and at one point lived there for the better part of a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6699.386s">I'm</a>  here tonight to urge the Medford City Council to speak out against this brutal conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6706.192s">Because</a>  I am Jewish, Israel's actions are being done in my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6711.796s">Because</a>  I am American, the conflict is being fueled with my tax money. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6717.781s">Therefore,</a>  I have not just the right, but the obligation to call for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6724.494s">I</a>  have demonstrated written emails made countless phone calls to our representatives in DC. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6732.138s">I've</a>  joined with other Jewish members of the fifth congressional district to press Catherine Clark, the Democratic whip in the House of Representatives to call for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6744.531s">But</a>  my most direct line to political power is through you all, my city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6751.196s">And</a>  yes, it makes a difference where you stand on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6756.72s">Your</a>  voice as a city council is louder than our individual voices can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6763.084s">Please</a>  use your voice to add Medford to the growing number of cities and towns nationwide that are calling for ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6770.816s">You'd</a>  be taking sides, not with Israel, not with Hamas, but with the children and innocent men and women who continue to be the victims of brutality, day after day, week after week, month after month. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6786.37s">Don't</a>  wait another minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6788.291s">You</a>  can do this tonight, right here, right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6791.714s">Please,</a>  take a stand for peace, take a stand for life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6796.879s">Ceasefire</a>  now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6805.011s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6805.412s">We</a>  have a hand on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6807.456s">I'm</a>  going to go to Kate on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6809.38s">Kate,</a>  please provide your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6811.665s">I</a>  will give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_56]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6818.732s">Hello,</a>  my name is Kate Ryan and I am on Warren Street in Medford and I am not at the city council meeting because as an autistic person, the environment is too hellish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6832.342s">And</a>  I am thinking about my brethren in Palestine right now who are suffering so much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6841.329s">This</a>  is a mass disabling event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6844.452s">We</a>  should not be supporting <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6847.97s">this</a>  we need peace we need it now and I would like you to all think about the fact that in the past two hours we have been at this city council meeting approximately 10 children in Gaza have been killed and that is all</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6874.889s">to</a>  go to the podium, name and address for the record, and I'll give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6908.587s">Jennifer,</a>  I'm sorry, could you press the button on the microphone? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6912.408s">You</a>  may have tapped it off.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Yanko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6914.869s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6915.849s">I</a>  don't need to start over, do I?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6917.069s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6918.21s">Well,</a>  we heard you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6918.85s">We'll</a>  get it for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Yanko]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6921.751s">And</a>  we're furious that our tax dollars are being used for this morally reprehensible purpose, especially when there's so much need here at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6931.914s">It's</a>  heartbreaking to see fellow human beings subjected to so much suffering on a daily and hourly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6939.235s">Tens</a>  of thousands have been killed and injured, children orphaned, the land destroyed, leaving a scorched earth where starvation and disease are now rampant. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6949.937s">Is</a>  this what we want to do with our tax dollars? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6954.318s">Today</a>  we're saying no, not on our watch, not in our name, not with our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6961.252s">If</a>  our leaders at the federal level don't have the backbone to act, let the cities and towns of our country be the moral voice of the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6969.339s">Neighboring</a>  cities of Cambridge and Somerville have already taken a stand, and I urge you, let us join them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6976.141s">The</a>  United States has the power to stop this carnage today, simply by cutting off funds and demanding an immediate ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6983.803s">Please,</a>  please be our voice and speak out for an immediate end to this gross misuse of our public resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6993.044s">Ceasefire</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6994.425s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6995.205s">We're</a>  going to go back to Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7002.861s">Grace</a>  Parker on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7005.384s">Grace,</a>  I'll unmute you, ask for your name and address, and I'll give you a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning on a two-minute time limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7016.096s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_45]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7017.179s">Hi,</a>  again, Grace Parker, Bell Lab, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7020.3s">I'll</a>  try to be quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7021.16s">I</a>  just wanted to say that I definitely agree with supporting this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7026.842s">The</a>  atrocities in Gaza are, I mean, so many people have already spoken to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7032.064s">And</a>  I want to say thank you to the people that spoke about their personal experiences and also that I'm just so sorry that you are in this position and that so many people have failed you and failed our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7046.738s">That's</a>  really the crux of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7047.918s">I</a>  don't wanna take up too much time just that I support this and I think you should all vote yes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7051.24s">Thank</a>  you, Grace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7054.561s">Go</a>  to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7059.723s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7061.343s">And</a>  I'll give you a 30-second warning and 10-second warning.</p>

    <p>[Beth Fascitelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7064.005s">Hi,</a>  my name is Beth Basciatelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7065.746s">I'm</a>  a Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7067.867s">And</a>  I would like to present a legal and moral argument for the council's consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7073.93s">I'm</a>  a scholar of global governance and human security. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7078.673s">Under</a>  international law, Israel is an occupying force. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7082.575s">It's</a>  an occupying force. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7084.836s">It</a>  is bound by the principle of protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7088.058s">Under</a>  the Geneva Convention, its duty is to protect the population of Gaza, including civilians and civilian infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7095.524s">It</a>  is also bound by the principles of precaution, distinction, proportionality, and necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7101.769s">According</a>  to any of these principles of international law, Israel is guilty of a whole series of war crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7109.286s">Also</a>  based on international law, the United States is guilty of the crime of legal complicity, which is listed in the Geneva Convention. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7117.729s">Complicity</a>  under the Genocide Convention is a crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7121.43s">It</a>  is legal complicity because it involves active support of a UN member state that is committing war crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7128.173s">The</a>  United States is providing economic, military, intelligence, and diplomatic support to block a ceasefire in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7135.987s">The</a>  genocide that is happening in Gaza could not happen without the support of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7142.209s">Apart</a>  from the sheer loss of life and property, Israel's continued impunity in committing acts of genocide and the United States' ongoing acts of complicity put multilateralism and the entire international law establishment at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7158.513s">These</a>  acts have created a dangerous precedent whereby any authoritarian leader with ethno-nationalist ideologies who comes to power in any country, including the United States, can make a case for committing gross violations of international law. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7177.682s">I</a>  recently attended a webinar with Craig Mobaker, who publicly resigned as director of the New York office of the high commissioner for human rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7185.249s">And</a>  he said, do not doubt this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7187.752s">If</a>  you don't care about Palestine, you are next. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7191.055s">International</a>  human rights is the only thing that stands between powerful actors and those of us who care about living, moving and speaking freely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7199.243s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7207.02s">very,</a>  very soon.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7220.969s">Hi</a>  there, I apologize my light isn't working in my room. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7229.614s">Lifelong</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7231.385s">uh</a>  person i'm medfed i live on central ave i am here today demanding a ceasefire <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7239.027s">I</a>  refuse to take part in something where we're going to call people collateral damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7243.069s">What</a>  we're seeing is not propaganda from Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7247.271s">We</a>  are seeing murder. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7248.892s">We</a>  are seeing genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7250.113s">We</a>  are seeing children crying. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7251.674s">We</a>  are seeing mothers and fathers losing their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7254.695s">We</a>  are seeing the wipe out of a whole demographic of people and I can't sit by and just swipe up on a social media app for distraction anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7265.701s">Ceasefire</a>  now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7269.872s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7273.854s">I'm</a>  going to go to the podium, name and address for the record, and you will have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7277.195s">I'll</a>  give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.</p>

    <p>[Eliezer Strassfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7279.436s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7279.836s">Elie</a>  Strassfeld, West Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7282.938s">I</a>  came here to commend the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7284.979s">I</a>  intended to commend the city council on this resolution and to speak out in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7289.581s">I</a>  believe Israel has a right to exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7293.142s">I</a>  believe Israelis should not have to exist in the threat of Hamas, and because of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7299.474s">I</a>  do not believe that an immediate ceasefire is justified, notwithstanding the heartbreaking stories, and I truly mean the heartbreaking stories I hear from my Medford neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7311.644s">However,</a>  I absolutely do not believe that Israel has clean hands here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7316.408s">And</a>  I absolutely believe, as the resolution stated, that an enduring ceasefire is critical and a movement back to a two-state solution is critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7326.175s">So</a>  I was thrilled to see that that's what the resolution said. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7331.522s">I</a>  have to say I am appalled that I come here and the resolution now is so dramatically different in tone than what was originally posted on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7342.628s">I</a>  implore the city council to please move back to the previous resolution that was posted publicly and that people had an opportunity to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7353.114s">It</a>  stands for something this entire city can get behind, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7357.717s">And</a>  that is that we all need to work toward an enduring peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7363.22s">We</a>  don't need to have disputes about definition, about history, the historical context that Councilperson Collins shared was good context, but completely incomplete. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7376.609s">And</a>  I'd ask that that part be stricken and that this council reverts to the version of this resolution that was previously before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7385.694s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7386.314s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7388.092s">I'm</a>  going to go to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7397.679s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7398.32s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7399.421s">Sorry,</a>  Susan, we can't have a flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7402.022s">There's</a>  a message on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7403.964s">We</a>  don't have flags or signs in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7406.306s">Pardon?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7407.446s">There's</a>  a message on your, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7411.369s">If</a>  you could hand it to Eileen for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7412.53s">But</a>  I am going to go to Zoom first. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7414.131s">We</a>  have Amina Awad on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7418.374s">I</a>  mean, I'm going to unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7419.514s">You</a>  can say your name, address and city or city, and give you a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning on a two minute timer for is yours.</p>

    <p>[Amina Awad]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7429.998s">Hi,</a>  my name is I mean I'm in speaking in favor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7433.58s">I'm</a>  a resident of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7437.817s">And</a>  as someone who grew up in the Middle East, the lack of action in this country is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7445.338s">I</a>  would be surprised at the shocking anti-Arab racism in this country had I not seen the legacy of racism and imperialism that remains. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7454.78s">Why</a>  are Palestinians always the last in politicians' speeches, including this council, who always mention Palestinians last, even though they're the ones that are victims of genocide? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7466.055s">Palestinians</a>  who are dying deserve to be recognized and heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7470.621s">My</a>  grandfather was forcibly displaced from Jerusalem by Zionist militia in 1948. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7475.748s">This</a>  did not start on October 7th or with Hamas. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7480.765s">The</a>  blockades on Gaza have existed for over a decade, and Israel has been killing Palestinians and stealing their land, conducting occupation and suppression for a long time, which is not a ceasefire, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7495.035s">Gaza</a>  was living under military occupation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7498.057s">And</a>  now, as I'm witnessing millions of Palestinians go through <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7502.08s">a</a>  second Nakba, which is a part of Israel's genocidal, colonial, and white supremacist regime. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7508.304s">This</a>  resolution must pass for our collective liberation and for the Palestinians in Medford, Somerville, and beyond to feel safe and supported by this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7517.509s">My</a>  grandfather, who was born in Jerusalem, died two hours away from Jerusalem in Man Jordan, never being able to return to his home, which is now occupied by settlers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7528.352s">So</a>  despite my family growing up for generations two hours outside the border of Jerusalem, not one of us has been able to step back into the city of our ancestors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7539.476s">And</a>  I also wanted to share a quote from a friend in Gaza who talks about <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7546.269s">One</a>  of his daily tasks in the North is burying the dead and decomposed bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7551.136s">Israeli</a>  forces have killed hundreds in the most horrific ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7555.162s">Almost</a>  daily we find dead bodies that we need to decide where to bury. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7560.39s">Never</a>  did I think that my life at 21 <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7564.195s">would</a>  be burying others. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7566.916s">In</a>  order to move forward, I have to convince myself that I do not know the bodies that I am burying, when they in fact could be my neighbors, my friends, or even family members that have been missing under the rubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7579.38s">I</a>  implore you to think as a human being and to stand with justice and what is right and call for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7588.444s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7599.413s">Please</a>  go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7602.234s">And</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Susan Gerard]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7603.114s">My</a>  name is Susan Girard. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7604.795s">I've</a>  been living in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7606.356s">I</a>  live on Farragut Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7607.556s">I've</a>  been living in Medford for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7610.837s">I'm</a>  Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7611.437s">I'm</a>  a mother and a grandmother. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7613.278s">And</a>  my message is really simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7616.279s">As</a>  people have stated, out of the 27,000 and growing children that have been killed under these bombs that our tax dollars are supporting, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7627.863s">out</a>  of the 27,000 people, over half of them are children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7632.164s">I</a>  cannot believe, for anyone who believes that the safety of Israel is important, I cannot believe that you are safe when you kill other people's children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7643.627s">And</a>  that's my statement, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7653.709s">Seeing</a>  no more hands on Zoom, we're gonna stick with the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7656.991s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7658.432s">You</a>  have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7659.092s">I'll</a>  give you a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7762.557s">Clare</a>  Sheridan, 190 High Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7766.28s">I</a>  support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7767.921s">Although</a>  not Jewish myself, I was an ardent supporter of the state of Israel until about 20 years ago when I began questioning Israel's treatment of its Palestinian neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7781.43s">So</a>  I traveled to Israel-Palestine twice over the last 15 years to educate myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7789.295s">I</a>  had two personal experiences that I want to convey because they are emblematic of what I found. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7797.469s">On</a>  one trip, I was with a group of American tourists in Hebron in the West Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7803.598s">We</a>  were watching a group of little children exiting their school. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7807.541s">The</a>  street was lined with Israeli soldiers with machine guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7812.325s">One</a>  said to me loudly in English, why are you watching that vermin? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7818.711s">I</a>  almost reminded him that that was what the Nazis called his forebears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7825.497s">But</a>  I held my tongue, he had a gun after all. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7829.781s">On</a>  another trip, I was at the airport heading home. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7833.748s">I</a>  was pulled aside and interrogated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7836.633s">My</a>  bags were searched separately and my passport withheld. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7841.801s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7842.161s">I</a>  had a stamp in my passport from a previous trip to Bosnia to visit an American friend's relatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7851.064s">The</a>  security guy asked me, so, do you love Muslims? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7856.545s">He</a>  wanted to know the names of the people I visited in Bosnia and the names of my friend in the US. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7863.527s">I</a>  responded sweetly that my Bosnian friend's husband was Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7870.609s">The</a>  official became very angry and shouted something I won't repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7876.393s">I</a>  responded, only in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7880.676s">He</a>  let me catch my plane.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7882.737s">You</a>  have 10 seconds, Claire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7883.718s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7884.398s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7894.565s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7896.286s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7897.747s">Two</a>  minutes.</p>

    <p>[Anna Meyer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7898.971s">Hi,</a>  my name is Anna Meyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7900.432s">I</a>  live at 6 Douglas Road in Medford, and I'm a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7906.756s">I'm</a>  here tonight to urge you to vote for the ceasefire resolutions with the amendments proposed by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7912.56s">I</a>  believe that passing this resolution will have two incredibly important impacts on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7917.663s">First,</a>  passing this resolution is an affirmation that Medford is a community that values all of its residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7924.187s">Ruth</a>  Wilson Gilmore tells us that where life is precious, life is precious. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7928.669s">What</a>  she means by that is that when we intentionally create communities that affirm the life of every person is meaningful, all people have the capacity to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7938.134s">The</a>  death count in Gaza has surpassed 27,000 individuals that we can count. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7943.117s">At</a>  least 10,000 of those deaths are children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7945.818s">Thousands</a>  more are displaced without access to food, clean water, or medical care. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7951.081s">Passing</a>  a ceasefire resolution affirms that Medford is a community that opposes this needless violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7957.723s">And</a>  it also affirms that Medford is a community that believes that the life of our Muslim and Arab siblings, as well as all of our neighbors that have experienced state sanctioned violence and the harms of colonialism are precious. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7970.242s">Second,</a>  passing this resolution puts important pressure on our federal elected officials who can use their power to call for a permanent and immediate ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7979.372s">This</a>  resolution will put pressure on Representatives Clark and Senators Warren and Markey to end the current humanitarian crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7986.4s">We'll</a>  also put pressure on them to vote against the legislation that's currently before the Senate that will provide an upwards of $14 billion in military aid to Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7996.445s">And</a>  this will help ensure that our tax dollars do not go towards intensifying a genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8001.668s">So</a>  with that, I urge you to pass a ceasefire resolution tonight so that we can affirm the preciousness of the lives of all of our neighbors and to use our voice to call for an end to this violence.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8012.313s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8012.914s">And</a>  I apologize for missing the warning.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8020.814s">name</a>  and address for the record, and I'll remember the 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_74]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8023.8s">Thanks,</a>  Travis Benson, 353 Main Street on Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8027.981s">I</a>  am aware this is a scarf and not a keffiyeh. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8031.403s">I'm</a>  doing my best, but I am here to support the resolution as it is currently amended for ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8037.865s">I</a>  don't know what else to say tonight that won't already be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8042.146s">There'll</a>  be many mentions from everyone here of the atrocities and casualties that have been going on with the decades long conflict with Israel and Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8055.392s">Maybe</a>  I'm simplistic and rigid in my thinking, but this conversation becomes really difficult for me whenever it strays away from the overwhelming asymmetric casualty rate that has continued for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8071.75s">as</a>  if this is a nuanced issue and that the agitation and cause of the loss of life must be explained or elaborated on further. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8078.378s">As</a>  more and more towns and cities pass these resolutions, and taking a stance on a ceasefire becomes much safer for everyone's public image and costs less and less political capital, history will look less and less fondly towards votes <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8092.674s">not</a>  in favor of this resolution, attempts to delay its passage, or suggestions to water the language down. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8099.358s">I've</a>  witnessed in-person other city meetings that have already taken votes on a ceasefire, and I would just like to note that it is very obvious to everyone watching, and will be even more obvious tomorrow, of the strong dissonance and disconnect that exists between the visible turnout in this room versus the passivity and appeasement that exists in all of tonight's four speeches.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8120.111s">We</a>  must always recognize that- 30 seconds, Travis.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_74]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8122.593s">Gotcha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8124.314s">It</a>  should not take this much effort, time, and energy to take a non-watered down stance on a genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8131.38s">It</a>  does not help us, your constituents, feel confident about your actions and representation on less urgent and less catastrophic issues if you do not take the strongest action on this resolution yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8143.009s">10</a>  seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8143.73s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8144.23s">Thank</a>  you, Travis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8153.837s">Name</a>  and address the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8154.603s">I'll</a>  give a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning.</p>

    <p>[Sharon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8157.8s">My</a>  name is Sharon. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8158.741s">I</a>  live at 14 Winter Hill Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8162.003s">And</a>  I've lived here for about a year and a half, and I really like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8164.545s">I'm</a>  working with the group Medford for Palestine to organize our city around this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8168.748s">I</a>  don't pretend to fully understand the deep complexities of the Israel-Palestine conflict that's been going on for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8176.154s">And</a>  I'm not personally implicated in it because of my religious or ethnic identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8180.237s">Therefore,</a>  I'm immensely privileged and obligated to educate myself, hold space for others, and stand up for peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8186.181s">Nobody</a>  in this room is under the illusion that Medford's resolution will put a stop to the violence overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8190.903s">However,</a>  I believe with every piece of my heart that many small actions can coalesce into something substantial that our federal government might actually listen to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8199.706s">That</a>  means we must take seriously our local actions on global matters, not dismiss them as beyond our scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8206.369s">These</a>  are the stepping stones with which we build a world we truly love and believe in and can trust to hold our future generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8212.892s">I</a>  hope we pass a ceasefire resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8215.813s">I</a>  hope that our collective actions shake the US government out of the nightmare that it is perpetuating by supplying bombs, weapons, and our tax dollars to fund Israel's militant campaign, which is destroying Palestinian lives under the false pretense of protecting Jewish ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8230.259s">We</a>  are all watching a genocide unfold on every screen we look at, at all hours of the day, every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8235.708s">We</a>  cannot do nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8237.871s">Palestine</a>  deserves peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8239.273s">Peace</a>  requires freedom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8241.016s">Free</a>  Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8241.657s">Ceasefire</a>  now.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8248.84s">Yes,</a>  in one second, I just want to say, if you are on Zoom and you would like to speak, please raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8254.043s">But</a>  I see no hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8255.504s">Go</a>  to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8256.625s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8258.125s">Two</a>  minutes, and I'll give a 30-second and a 10-second warning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_43]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8262.162s">I'll</a>  be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8263.383s">I</a>  am Simcha Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8264.903s">I</a>  live on 59 Winchester Street here in Somerville, Medford, my bad, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8270.806s">It's</a>  been a long day, came from work. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8275.508s">I</a>  have not been a resident of Medford for that long, but I grew up four miles away. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8281.45s">And</a>  I am a proud observant Jew that wakes up every day disgusted that this is done in my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8292.342s">And</a>  I don't want to say more. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8295.385s">There</a>  have been other people who have said what I've said from my position. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8298.629s">I</a>  didn't really prepare in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8301.612s">I'm</a>  a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8305.855s">I</a>  was raised by a union nurse, local. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8310.497s">And</a>  I think that I wanna bring it back to you are our voice, our voices aren't being heard otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8318.801s">This</a>  is a way for us to amplify our voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8321.763s">And</a>  specifically, I wanna draw back the attention to the personal horrors and anecdotes that were shared earlier by my neighbors here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8334.269s">that</a>  are Palestinian and have been facing the unknowns of every single day facing this horror. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8346.32s">I</a>  urge the city council to please put forward this amended resolution.</p>

    <p>[Esther Alter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8371.06s">Hello,</a>  I'm Esther Alter, I live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8374.28s">I</a>  am a Jew, and I grew up in a very Zionist synagogue, and I'm well aware of the emotional component to this, that the Zionists want security, and they're on a perpetual defensive posture. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8397.887s">I</a>  am not a Zionist. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8399.708s">We</a>  are a minority, and we always will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8404.69s">And</a>  our safety is contingent on being generous and empathetic neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8412.074s">If</a>  the institutions ostensibly representing our interests continue to fail to call for the end of the genocide of our neighbors because they don't want to divide a community or make some people feel unsafe, then we will always be divided, and we will never be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8430.981s">Cease</a>  fire now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_61]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8431.721s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Deborah Cooper]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8444.207s">Deborah</a>  Cooper, 112 Lawrence Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8449.25s">I</a>  stand for the sanctity of human life and culture, and I admire the courage of this council in bringing this motion forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8458.456s">Beloved</a>  American poet Maya Angelou has said that of all the virtues, courage is the most important because without it, no other virtues can be performed consistently. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8471.533s">How</a>  do you build the courage to stand up to injustice? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8475.036s">You</a>  start with something small, like a weightlifter who begins with a few pounds and builds up to 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8482.283s">You</a>  stand up against injustice and it feels good, so you do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8488.349s">Six</a>  years ago, we stood up against injustice and the Muslim immigration ban, and that felt good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8497.702s">Along</a>  with many Medford residents, I ask this council to show your courage by passing the ceasefire resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8506.11s">Free</a>  Palestine, ceasefire now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8507.992s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nathan Foster]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8515.916s">name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8516.897s">You</a>  have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8518.018s">My</a>  name is Nathan Foster. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8519.419s">I</a>  live at 163 Main Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8521.781s">I'm</a>  a Medford resident and I'm Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8524.143s">I'm</a>  here in support of a ceasefire now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8526.686s">I</a>  thank the council for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8530.729s">What</a>  is happening in Gaza right now, what the Israeli military is doing in Gaza is morally indefensible. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8535.794s">It</a>  is horrific and <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8538.536s">It's</a>  just plain wrong, and that's reason enough to support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8543.18s">I</a>  would like to speak to some things that have been brought up around the issue of the safety of Jewish people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8549.405s">My</a>  grandparents were Holocaust survivors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8551.567s">I</a>  take this very seriously, and I would just like to state that the war that is being waged by Israel in the name of the safety of Jewish people has nothing to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8560.274s">Absolutely</a>  nothing to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8561.554s">It's</a>  a war of revenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8563.235s">It</a>  is, for some, a war of territorial expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8566.216s">It's</a>  not about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8568.817s">One</a>  phrase that is used to describe Israel's repeated attacks on Gaza since 2008, which once I heard it, I couldn't unhear, is mowing the grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8581.061s">This</a>  is used to describe these repeated attacks as something that is inevitable and will just keep happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8587.087s">It's</a>  such a dehumanizing and normalizing phrase, but it also speaks to the futility of these cycles of violence and the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8596.716s">And</a>  Israel, which is oppressing the Palestinian people, which is denying basic freedom, basic human rights, will never achieve the kind of safety that is talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8606.565s">Safety</a>  can only come through peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8608.727s">It</a>  can only come through the freedom and human rights of Palestinians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8611.39s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8612.831s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8623.176s">Thank</a>  you, Benjamin, 76 Marion Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8627.439s">I'm</a>  a recent new Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8629.58s">I</a>  appreciate the resolution being forward today and I want to speak in support of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8633.722s">I</a>  don't have any personal ties to Palestine or Israel, but like many here, the events unfolding since October 7th have deeply impacted me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8640.506s">The</a>  ongoing killing in Gaza and the West Bank, the displacement of an entire people from their homes without a safe place to go, without enough food, water, medicine is horrifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8649.071s">And</a>  as a resident of this country, I feel the responsibility to speak up today because the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8653.796s">is</a>  not just a powerful player in this conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8656.219s">It</a>  doesn't have just leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8657.861s">It</a>  is, alongside Israel, the main perpetrator of the suffering of the Palestinian people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8662.106s">It</a>  is with U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8662.787s">bombs</a>  and U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8663.467s">fighter</a>  jets that the Israeli military has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8668.473s">It</a>  is our administration that has and continues to fund this war. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8671.554s">It</a>  is our administration that stands alone in the world in vetoing one ceasefire resolution after another in the UN Security Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8677.716s">It</a>  is our administration that two weeks ago suspended all funding for the main UN organization providing humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza, the UNRWA. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8686.518s">Our</a>  elected administration is not just a bystander to this genocide, but an active participant that is able to stop this war tomorrow if it wants to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8693.64s">That's</a>  why I think it matters that cities like Medford pass a ceasefire resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8698.121s">It</a>  demonstrates to our community, in particular its Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, as well as Jewish and Israeli members, that we care about their lives and that of their relatives, friends, colleagues, that we fully condemn the loss of life, the complete destruction of housing and basic human services and goods in Gaza, that we value all human life, that we want everyone to feel safe here and to feel comfortable to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8718.604s">And</a>  it demonstrates to our government that the city of Medford does not stand behind the support of the ongoing genocide, that we stand for peace and immediate ceasefire now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8727.187s">The</a>  more cities that pass resolutions like this, the higher will be the pressure on Biden to stop this war now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8733.629s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bri Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8812.724s">Hi,</a>  my name is Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8814.546s">I</a>  live at 31 Gleason Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8819.169s">I</a>  came here tonight because I'm a Medford parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8824.193s">I</a>  have two children, ages two and six. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8828.076s">And</a>  my youngest, she goes to a home daycare, and her daycare teacher is a Palestinian. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8837.031s">And</a>  every day that I drop her off and pick her up, I see her face just, it's puffy, she's hiding it, but I know that she cries daily while trying to take care of these children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8851.983s">And</a>  so I'm here just holding her in my heart, honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8857.307s">And</a>  I had this whole thing that I was going to read that I read earlier at the rally, but the personal testimonies <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8867.715s">from</a>  these people back here is more powerful than anything I could ever say. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8873.758s">So</a>  what I will say is that I'm just going to quote Motaz Azizia, who is one of the heroes of Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8884.483s">He</a>  has more followers than the president of the United States as a result of all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8893.203s">And</a>  he has truly brought this genocide to our hands.</p>

    <p>[Eric Fox]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8923.368s">Hi,</a>  my name is Eric Fox. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8924.708s">I</a>  live at 10 Revere Place. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8928.189s">I</a>  first of all, foremost want to thank the Councilor Collins for bringing forth this resolution calling for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8935.291s">I</a>  personally am Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8937.391s">I</a>  have, like many others that have spoken today, have grandparents that were survivors of the Holocaust and other members of my family who I never got to know because they were killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8949.074s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8952.062s">More</a>  importantly, I've experienced antisemitism in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8957.984s">I</a>  have also experienced and seen and witnessed Islamophobia and xenophobia in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8965.107s">And</a>  so I applaud the council for bringing and talking about this issue and just hearing all of these stories tonight, hearing everyone and hearing how this conflict has been affecting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8977.472s">personally</a>  makes it clear that this is not purely a national issue that should be ignored by a local city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8986.017s">It's</a>  not something that doesn't qualify as a local Medford issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8990.479s">This</a>  clearly is a Medford issue that is affecting its residents and in a very deep and personal way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8997.623s">So</a>  I encourage you to vote for this ceasefire amendment, the amended version in the resolution, and I hope you do because it clearly is very important to Medford locals. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9011.816s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9012.197s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_46]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9094.082s">My</a>  name is Harlan from Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9095.823s">I</a>  grew up in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9097.564s">I've</a>  been going to day things at Tufts all my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9102.446s">And</a>  my mother and I have lived in Somerville with my brothers for over 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9108.229s">And</a>  my mother had to flee when she was a child because of what was going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9113.371s">And</a>  every time I go back to Palestine to visit, I get harassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9119.062s">I</a>  don't care you know my American passport my father being an American army soldier and all my uncles on his side, I still get harassed four or five hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9130.409s">One</a>  time I called my mother up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9133.966s">and</a>  said, mom, they're gonna put me on a plane. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9137.589s">My</a>  mother was standing on the other side of the wall to get out of the airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9141.071s">And</a>  I was like, mom, they're gonna put me on a plane. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9142.672s">That's</a>  what I thought they were gonna do to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9144.634s">And</a>  it's so scary to see when you go there to see the tear gas going off and having to run into a store in the neighborhood in Ramallah because somebody did something and I don't know what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9157.423s">Relatives</a>  have been arrested and imprisoned for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9161.105s">But</a>  you know what the most important thing is? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9163.146s">Even</a>  the poorest Palestinian, you go and visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9165.967s">Like</a>  Claire was saying, Claire has come with me several times to Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9171.27s">And</a>  they took her in and I thought she was more family than I was. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9176.852s">That's</a>  how the Palestinians, they may not have water coming out of their faucet. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9183.134s">But</a>  you know what, you'll have a nice bed to sleep in, and a male fit for a king and queen. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9189.437s">So</a>  that's, I just want to say, I hope that you do like Somerville does and Cambridge does, and quick action, which was great, and vote for a resolution to cease fire now, free Palestine.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9199.922s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_68]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9487.571s">My</a>  name is Raviv and I live on Pinkham and Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9490.674s">I'm</a>  here as a member of the Medford community and as the grandchild of people who fled violent antisemitism in their home countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9497.44s">It</a>  is not my place to speak of the experiences of living under 75 years of violence and occupation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9502.905s">I</a>  urge you to hold those testimonies which have already been shared here today with the weight and compassion they are owed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9508.891s">I'm</a>  here because my Jewish values compel me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9511.733s">To</a>  suggest that opposing the genocide being exacted by the State of Israel is anti-Semitism is not only logically inconsistent, it is offensive and dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9521.026s">Months</a>  ago, after the death of Massa Amini, Iranians took to the streets to condemn the Iranian government. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9527.194s">as</a>  many in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9528.115s">joined</a>  in support of the rallying cries of women, life, freedom, they did so free from accusations of Islamophobia. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9535.199s">And</a>  yet now, as we stand here calling for a ceasefire, we are met with accusations of anti-Semitism, of implications that ceasefire will jeopardize the safety of Jewish residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9544.585s">I</a>  urge the city council to reconcile with the hypocrisy of these accusations, of accusing a Jewish city councilor and an overwhelming number of Jewish residents here today with anti-Semitism. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9555.552s">To</a>  insinuate that supporting an end to violence will create division in our community, I challenge you to consider what version of unity and peace is being disrupted. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9563.897s">For</a>  the Palestinian members of our community, that peace never existed to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9568.868s">For</a>  non-Jews afraid of accusations of anti-Semitism, I stand before you as a representative of the millions of Jews here in the U.S., in Israel, and around the world who are supporting a ceasefire and an end to occupation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9580.514s">For</a>  those who support ceasefire, please know that the Jewish members in this chamber and around the world stand with you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_54]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9591.974s">and</a>  an end to occupation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9593.235s">For</a>  those who support ceasefire, please know the Jewish members in this chamber and around the world stand with you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9601.56s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9601.921s">I</a>  see that you're unmuted and I will give you a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9606.163s">You</a>  have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9607.945s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9610.106s">Council</a>  President Bears and I am speaking from my heart and from my head at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9624.402s">I</a>  feel that I have been around a lot longer than many of the council members and some of the people who are in the chamber this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9633.508s">I</a>  have seen wars, many wars, grand wars. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9639.812s">Very</a>  luckily for Americans that they were on opposite sides of the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9645.419s">My</a>  very dear friend, whom I grew up with, married an Israeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9649.782s">She</a>  lives there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9650.883s">She</a>  said it's absolutely horrible scene. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9654.186s">She</a>  had a peaceful week, but she said, we don't know what will happen tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9658.109s">This</a>  war, internally, you must know, has been going on for centuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9669.597s">I</a>  definitely commiserate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9672.839s">with</a>  anyone who is a victim of war, especially at this time in history, it's 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9682.787s">Some</a>  of these people are living back in ancient history. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9685.909s">I</a>  haven't quite decided yet with my age, what is a real good resolution for any war? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9694.576s">Israel</a>  has had ceasefire before. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9697.19s">and</a>  still has been subject to bombings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9702.091s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9702.731s">People</a>  are getting killed in Palestine, but only one person tonight, may I say, one person in not in exclusive terms mentioned the word Hamas. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9714.955s">Israel</a>  is not at war with the Palestinian innocence. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9718.556s">It</a>  is at war with Hamas. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9720.763s">I</a>  believe, believe that part of this could be a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9724.685s">There</a>  are grand talks going on right now, even as we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9728.247s">Palestine</a>  needs to ask Hamas to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9733.65s">Then</a>  the rest, I think, can very nicely fall in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9737.172s">I</a>  respect all your wishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9738.853s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_44]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9798.046s">Hello,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9799.046s">My</a>  name is Sarah Halawa, and I live in Somerville at 43 Monroe Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9804.889s">And</a>  I am here to speak to you about what it means to pass a ceasefire resolution to the Muslim community, to the Arab community, and to the Palestinian community in your town. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9818.315s">I'll</a>  tell you a little bit about myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9820.296s">My</a>  father was born to a large Jewish family and as a young man fell in love with Islam and converted and I was born and raised Muslim. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9829.562s">He</a>  built the mosque in my town. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9831.563s">He</a>  was a very devoted man to his faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9835.465s">He</a>  has a testament that this is no religious war, and he would tell anybody who he ever met who would listen to him at length about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9842.77s">My</a>  husband, his father was born in Nablus in the West Bank, and he was a teenager when the Israeli occupation began. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9851.056s">They</a>  invaded the West Bank, Nablus, and the occupation began. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9856.02s">One</a>  night, he was awoken at gunpoint as 20 Israeli soldiers stormed his house, burst open the door, knocked down his parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9865.008s">He</a>  was arrested and detained and tortured for three days in all of the ways that we are seeing today on our social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9872.115s">He</a>  was stripped naked. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9873.176s">He</a>  had dogs put on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9874.598s">He</a>  was physically abused. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9875.719s">He</a>  was deprived of food. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9877.18s">water,</a>  warmth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9879.102s">And</a>  then when they were done, they released him under curfew that everybody in his city lives under, which meant that the Israeli soldiers who were patrolling could shoot on sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9888.628s">When</a>  he asked them what he should do about this, they laughed at him and they said, this is your problem.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9893.692s">Sorry,</a>  you have 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10611.127s">Yes,</a>  I'm Matthew Paige Lieberman I live at 15 Canal Street here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10616.012s">I</a>  just want to start by saying that I extremely appreciate what has been brought before us that we can all really kind of consider about our contribution to this world and what kind of roles we want to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10627.342s">I</a>  completely appreciate that Councilor Collins also acknowledged the humanity of everyone and did not do any apology whatsoever for any of the sociopathic massacres that we've seen over the past few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10643.125s">I</a>  am a, like many people before me, I am a descendant of the Holocaust survivors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10648.906s">My</a>  grandfather made it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10650.746s">All</a>  of his brothers and sisters were killed by the Nazis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10653.787s">There</a>  is an expression that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10656.889s">For</a>  Jews, all of us are survivors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10659.111s">We're</a>  all survivors because the Nazis wanted to take our seed from this planet. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10666.356s">And</a>  for me, that puts a particular impact with me, in which recently, the International Criminal Court <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10676.823s">was</a>  not able to determine yet if it is a genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10680.426s">But</a>  they are kind of taking a little they say it will take them a few years to make that determination completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10687.29s">However,</a>  they have told Israel to take all steps necessary to ensure that it's not committing a genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10694.676s">Now</a>  Netanyahu's regime has decided to completely ignore that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10698.803s">completely</a>  ignore that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10700.443s">And</a>  I want to honor all the people that are suffering from this in Palestine and in Israel, and I especially want to honor the family members of the hostages who have pled with the Israeli regime to care about the hostages, yet Israel, Netanyahu's regime prefers to butcher people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10719.639s">That's</a>  a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10720.84s">The</a>  family members of hostages, they broke into a commerce meeting, and they said, please take care of our hostages.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10728.426s">You</a>  have 10 seconds, Matt.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10732.349s">I</a>  would just end by saying none of us are made safer by thousands of people being massacred constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10738.875s">And</a>  we need to really cut it out with that nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10741.337s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10742.778s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10750.782s">I</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10753.123s">I'm</a>  now going back on what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10754.284s">I</a>  said people could only speak once earlier procedural question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10757.666s">I'm</a>  not going to procedural question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10759.087s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Eliezer Strassfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10759.847s">I'm</a>  wondering if the council would consider us votes on the original resolution and the vote on the amended resolution separately.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10767.671s">I</a>  will leave that to Councilors to make procedural motions as I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10772.214s">I</a>  do want to say before I turn back to Councilors that I want to thank everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10778.717s">This</a>  is a <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10780.373s">This</a>  can be, I've run some tough meetings, and this actually wasn't one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10785.994s">And</a>  I really appreciate everyone, regardless of what they believed and what they felt, for just respecting everyone's time and their chance to tell their stories, because there's some incredibly powerful stories told tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10799.518s">I</a>  have told folks, I'm supportive of this resolution as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10802.319s">That's</a>  all I'm gonna say from the chair, because I really probably shouldn't have even have said that, but I really wanna thank <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10808.38s">all</a>  of you for your time, for your words, and for just, you're creating a respectful space for the people who ask to be heard to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10818.384s">95-99%.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10819.544s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10820.104s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Collins, and then Councilor Tseng, and then Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10831.789s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10833.689s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10835.56s">Thank</a>  you to everybody who spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10837.961s">I</a>  already made the motion to adopt the new language and move forward with that new language. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10844.485s">Motion</a>  to adopt, yeah, that's what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10846.606s">And</a>  I'll now motion to amend and adopt the new language. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10853.09s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10854.111s">I</a>  hear everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10856.272s">I</a>  hear all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10860.555s">I</a>  don't know if it's possible for everybody to be heard equally, but I hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10865.379s">And</a>  I motion for approval of the resolution as amended.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10869.082s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Khan seconded by second seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10873.586s">I</a>  will go to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Kelly and Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10876.886s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10877.286s">I</a>  wanted to thank everyone who spoke, no matter what viewpoint of this resolution they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10885.63s">It</a>  really means a lot to our city and our democracy that you're willing to take time out of your evening to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10891.993s">In</a>  that spirit, we also owe you, at least in my opinion, I owe you your faith, and me as your city councilor, to let you know that I care. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10904.438s">I</a>  care about the stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10906.639s">I</a>  know that many of you, as you've said tonight, have family who've been in the area, who are currently still in the area, who are trapped there, who are suffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10915.721s">And</a>  I think this is a moment where people need to know that their local electeds care, that they not only hear them, but they, I think, deeply, deeply, that this deeply matters to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10932.979s">I</a>  don't think it's wrong at all to say that the context is complex, that there's misinformation, and there's violence and tragedy that civilians take the brunt of. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10946.856s">I</a>  don't think it's wrong to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10952.282s">a</a>  lot of the rhetoric in the debate has been challenging for others to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10957.987s">But</a>  I have to thank you as a councillor that you've kept this conversation, this discourse tonight so cordial, so respectful, that you've followed the rules that the council president has set out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10971.317s">But</a>  you know, even given this, the complex history and context behind this issue, I think the question before us, the heart of this resolution is simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10982.128s">And</a>  I think the big question is, do we affirm the sanctity, the preciousness, and the equality of all human life? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10992.478s">And</a>  do we <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10994.389s">condemn</a>  the bloodshed going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=10996.491s">I</a>  think it's not wrong to say that war begets war. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11000.093s">And</a>  I think we should listen to the hostages' pleas to the Israeli government, that their government not do anything that worsens the outcome of people living in Israel and Palestine, of the civilians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11013.804s">And</a>  their pleas not to drive more people into extremism. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11020.849s">I</a>  was struck by the word precedent earlier in public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11026.634s">Because</a>  even though we can't, as a city council, we can't stop what's going on from becoming precedent, I think we can stop normalizing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11037.853s">And</a>  I think we have a moral duty to stop normalizing violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11044.061s">We</a>  have to speak out against it, even if we can't stop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11047.525s">On</a>  the issue of precedence, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11053.692s">thought</a>  during the debate about my own family. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11057.673s">For</a>  those of you who don't know, my family comes from Taiwan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11062.294s">Pretty</a>  much everyone in my family lives in Taiwan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11064.954s">And</a>  if you've been following the news, we talk about war, the possibility of war every day in Taiwan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11070.636s">And</a>  I think about if this were happening over there right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11077.236s">Number</a>  one, if we set this precedent, what that would mean for my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11082.299s">I</a>  also think about what it would mean to me if I were watching and my community didn't support my family and didn't hear my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11092.205s">And</a>  while Taiwan is a hypothetical for me, it's emotionally close to me, Palestine is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11098.168s">And</a>  Palestine is now for so many of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11103.004s">This</a>  resolution I think is measured. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11105.326s">I</a>  think it's reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11107.207s">I</a>  think, yes, it is ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11109.209s">I</a>  think it is nuanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11111.411s">I</a>  think it speaks to the complexities on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11116.355s">I</a>  think it condemns terrorism. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11118.016s">I</a>  think it condemns Hamas. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11120.038s">But</a>  I think it supports life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11123.461s">I</a>  think it uplifts life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11125.222s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11126.704s">This</a>  is a moral duty to say to our residents, no matter if you're Arab, Muslim, Jewish, Israeli-American, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11135.81s">You</a>  belong in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11137.051s">You</a>  deserve to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11139.392s">And</a>  that's why I'll plan to vote yes on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11144.776s">And</a>  I know there are a lot of folks at home watching who <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11150.792s">are</a>  just getting into activism, there are small steps that we can all take to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11157.155s">While</a>  this is symbolic, donating an eSIM is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11161.357s">Helping</a>  people in Gaza stay connected for just up to $5 a month is not symbolic. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11167.82s">These</a>  are actions that we can take to help people on the ground, to stay connected to the world, and donations to human rights organizations, relief organizations, will really help people on the ground.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11191.067s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11192.048s">I</a>  so appreciate everyone who is involved in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11195.77s">And</a>  I want to say, just for a moment, about the amended language, that that is actually part of the democratic process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11203.874s">So</a>  the original language that was posted was there for people to interact with. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11210.478s">That</a>  is why it was there, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11212.359s">It</a>  wasn't there to remain untouched until we arrived here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11217.34s">It</a>  was there so that people could be involved in democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11221.101s">Sorry,</a>  I'll direct my comments to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11223.822s">Could</a>  be involved in democracy and they did, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11226.963s">They</a>  reached out to Councilor Collins and probably to, I certainly had someone reach out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11232.364s">People</a>  reached out to the councilors and to the sponsor of this particular resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11239.426s">to</a>  state what they wanted, their vision of what they wanted this to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11244.688s">And</a>  I know that many, many people did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11247.069s">And</a>  that's where the amended language came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11250.17s">So</a>  I don't want people to think that we are simply looking at amended language that sprung out of one of our minds without input, and that we're voting on it without <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11261.755s">you</a>  know, thinking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11262.956s">But</a>  this was something that really was worked on by many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11267.1s">I</a>  appreciate all of their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11268.702s">I</a>  appreciate all of the time of everyone who has been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11272.105s">It</a>  is well worth our staying up late for the things that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11279.372s">And</a>  I really appreciate that and just wanted to chat for a minute about <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11285.137s">how</a>  much I appreciate people being involved in our democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=11288.358s">I</a>  do hope that folks will come back and will stay on top of the things that are coming up in the city council and will reach out to us before they're voted on to help us make them better.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12539.813s">Yes,</a>  I had a meeting with Frances Nwaje. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12546.517s">Can</a>  we make an amendment to this that says designee? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12550.159s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12550.499s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12552.961s">This</a>  is Paige. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12556.283s">She's</a>  lovely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12556.823s">It</a>  was a really great conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12558.604s">I</a>  just think it would be... <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12562.842s">an</a>  absolute sort of bare minimum, one hour, twice a year, where we have a refresher, just maybe anything that might've come up in our interactions that could be something that we would be thinking about as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12580.008s">I'm</a>  curious about what it would take for us to meet, to convene. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12587.37s">Would</a>  we be able to do it with open meeting laws being as they are? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12592.572s">Would</a>  we have to do it in an open meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12594.633s">Or</a>  would we be able to do a training? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12596.134s">So</a>  we would have to do a training here?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12597.795s">We</a>  would have to do a training committee of the whole, if we wanted all Councilors to be part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12602.198s">Or</a>  we could do trainings in smaller groups.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12605.16s">We</a>  could do smaller groups separate.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12608.182s">Could</a>  we do... There may be exemptions to the open meeting law, we'll have to look into it.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12613.624s">I</a>  would be curious to hear about exemptions to open meeting law for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12618.488s">But</a>  either way, I am happy to refer this to the committee on resident services, probably, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12626.853s">City</a>  clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12628.535s">Ooh,</a>  he's a councilor now.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12631.417s">Clerk</a>  of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12632.638s">Councilor,</a>  if you'd let me interrupt for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12639.781s">In</a>  my previous iteration in state government, we did some training sessions with members of the MassDOT board. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12648.246s">We</a>  actually had the general counsel in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12649.727s">We</a>  don't have a city solicitor, but we had the general counsel in the room to make sure that nobody deliberated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12654.129s">There</a>  was very specific rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12655.61s">So</a>  let me do a little research on that because there may be a way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12659.813s">Obviously,</a>  you're correct because you wanna do it without violating the meeting law, but there may be a way to have the training without violating the meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12666.697s">So</a>  if you let me do a little research on it, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12669.338s">find</a>  some answers for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12670.84s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12671.5s">I</a>  would appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12672.781s">But</a>  I would motion to request that the clerk does that research, but also that we refer this to the resident services subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12690.793s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12691.473s">I'll</a>  be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12692.194s">I</a>  also talked to Director Nwaje about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12694.816s">Obviously,</a>  I think we're all very excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12698.178s">An</a>  idea that we had started to talk about before we got pulled away from each other was including boards and commissions in this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12706.043s">There's</a>  a feeling in the office that perhaps we could do more to align everyone with how DEI works in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12715.91s">especially</a>  given that there are a lot of updates in recent years, and there haven't been many, if any, trainings on this for boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12723.374s">And</a>  so I would love, if you were amenable, for this to be amended to add exploring doing this for boards and commissions.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12735.559s">I'm</a>  amenable.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Clerkin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12766.997s">Patrick</a>  Clark in 50 Princeton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12770.273s">I</a>  want to commend Councilor Lazzaro for putting this motion forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12774.277s">I</a>  share conditional enthusiasm for biannual DEI training and encourage City Council's consideration of the following conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12781.844s">DEI</a>  training could be folded into an overall city employee training, also including nepotism and conflict of interest, where all three together will bring forward the most competent and qualified candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12794.366s">The</a>  nepotism section would emphasize prevention of the old boys club of private deals and back-slapping, where family lineage and patronage determine qualification for government service. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12804.235s">The</a>  DEI section could emphasize variety and integration of broadly cross-sectional experiences and skills across government, in practice and in recruiting, as opposed to simply patronizing box-ticking visual diversity, which can also lead to poor qualifications along a path parallel to nepotism. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12822.674s">Three,</a>  the conflict of interest section could emphasize public disclosure of membership in or receipt of resources from state, national, or global organizations, whether they be in the form of a hierarchy or network whose stated goals undermine the fulfillment of responsibilities as an employee of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12840.501s">These</a>  trainings would not only be undergone by city employees during their tenure, but also publicly disclosed and advertised in a place of common access during campaigns or before hirings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12850.728s">This</a>  would fulfill both the calls for transparency, competence, and integrity within government and between the public and one fell swoop. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12858.133s">If</a>  implemented and followed in the true spirit of this proposal, these measures will prevent the kind of mob formation, trials by ordeal, and loyalty tests recently depicted in the film Oppenheimer from being carried out in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12871.042s">Times</a>  of high confusion, stress, and suspicion coupled with low transparency have often congealed into culture wars attempting to rip some bogeyman or folk devil out by the roots. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12881.617s">Witches,</a>  communists, fascists, Jews, racists, anti-Semites. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12886.263s">We</a>  could take a wider lens on what DEI, in union with other measures, could do for Medford's future, or we could see it turn into proving one's diversity credentials in an oppressive, harassing, ultimately counterproductive manner equal and opposite to proving one's patriotism credentials. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12901.928s">Let's</a>  proceed wisely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12903.408s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12904.129s">Thank</a>  you for your comment, and Mr. Clerk, please record that as comment on the record for item <a href="../resolutions/24-022.pdf"><font color="green">24-022</font></a>, and my apologies for not calling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12911.371s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12935.128s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="../resolutions/24-023.pdf"><font color="green">24-023</font></a>, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the City of Medford explore the options, costs, and requirements to open a warming and cooling center for adults experiencing homelessness in December 2024.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12947.045s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the Medford City Council invite representatives from the administration, including the Board of Health, along with stakeholders in our community and in neighboring communities to attend meetings on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12957.212s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12959.619s">I</a>  will start by saying that I'm planning to refer this to the committee on public health and community safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12969.284s">I</a>  have been emailing with our board of health folks with a number of stakeholders in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12981.55s">And</a>  I think the main concern, the main issue I anticipate is space. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=12987.518s">Somerville</a>  and Revere have both opened warming centers this winter, using a model that is based on the Malden Warming Center, which I help run in Malden, which is a nonprofit, but they use that sort of as a template. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13006.065s">And</a>  those cities, Somerville and Revere, have opened their centers by contracting with Housing Families, which is another nonprofit. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13015.501s">So</a>  the cities use city buildings and they pay housing families to operate the warming centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13023.747s">So</a>  I spoke with <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13029.232s">a</a>  woman in Somerville who told me it costs them about $200,000 to contract housing families, and they use the armory. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13038.974s">I'm</a>  trying to sort of figure out what the ballpark would be for Medford to run something like that for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13048.495s">But</a>  mostly what I want to do is figure out all of that in a committee meeting with all of the people that would be involved in <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13057.785s">making</a>  something like that happen, but I think the most critical thing for Medford will be space, and if we can find something that is either city-owned or affordable enough for us to make it happen, and if we have any kind of space in the budget, and I'm not sure if we do, or if we would need to do something where we try to just find a nonprofit or a church group that wants to try to run it for us, but <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13087.202s">The</a>  critical thing that I've observed from my work with unhoused adults in this region is that homelessness isn't a municipal issue, it's a regional issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13098.305s">So</a>  once you lose your housing, you're not considered a resident of anywhere anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13104.467s">You</a>  just kind of go where the services are. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13106.807s">So</a>  you're not bound by the lines in a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13110.488s">And</a>  I've had guests at the Malden Warming Center that I knew from Medford because <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13117.07s">I</a>  knew them from town. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13119.571s">So</a>  I know that there is need in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13122.212s">And</a>  I know that we could help a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13124.212s">And</a>  I know that we could partner with other folks in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13128.534s">And</a>  we could all do a lot of good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13131.215s">So</a>  I look forward to having deeper conversations with people once we can spend more time in committee talking about it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13469.449s">Madam</a>  Chair, just if I may also add, I just wanted to add in that it's really important to get this on the desk of Representative Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13480.234s">As</a>  you noted, Senators Warren and Markey have supported a number of these proposals, as well as Reps. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13485.137s">McGovern,</a>  Pressley-Lynch, Moulton-Linterhan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13486.997s">Representative</a>  Clark has not. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13488.538s">So</a>  that is something where this is directly providing some advocacy on our federal delegate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13493.46s">Representative</a>  Clark, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nick Giurleo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13502.19s">Good</a>  evening, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13503.091s">My</a>  name is Nicholas Shirleo. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13504.451s">I</a>  live at 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13505.812s">I'm</a>  a lifetime Medford resident, an attorney, and director of an international relations publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13511.895s">I'm</a>  not speaking on behalf of that publication tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13515.576s">I</a>  am, though, speaking in opposition personally to the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13519.619s">Putting</a>  aside why the council is spending time crafting legislation on international politics when our city faces plenty of problems on its own, the proposed resolution in effect supports the totalitarian government of Cuba, a socialist dictatorship with a horrendous human rights record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13537.23s">As</a>  Human Rights Watch, one of many organizations, has highlighted, Cuban government human rights abuses have included arbitrary arrests of activists and independent journalists, torture of prisoners, significant repression of free speech, and extrajudicial killings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13555.236s">Nearly</a>  a million people have fled Cuba's communist regime. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13558.499s">Imagine</a>  some or many have called Medford their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13563.144s">We</a>  should embrace these people, not tout Cuban government propaganda at our city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13569.53s">Put</a>  simply, a vote for this resolution is a vote in favor of the current regime. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13573.914s">The</a>  United States of America should not be doing business with dictatorships. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13578.178s">Why</a>  would Medford support the contrary? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13580.0s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13582.674s">Thank</a>  you very much for your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13583.994s">Before</a>  we get to you, I'm just going to go to a hand raised on Zoom, then we'll get right along to the folks at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13588.676s">I'm</a>  going to ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13589.897s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13596.719s">Yes,</a>  I'm Matthew Page Lieberman. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13597.9s">I</a>  live at 15 Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13599.1s">I</a>  very much support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13601.161s">There's</a>  not much I could say that wasn't already covered in the text. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13604.682s">of</a>  the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13605.543s">And</a>  I think that it's incredibly, just like with the one about Gaza, we have, fortunately, we have Edwards, Markey, and Warren's support, but we have to play our role in order to also nudge. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13624.105s">our</a>  representative, Catherine Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13628.486s">I</a>  think there are a few questions that should be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13631.187s">One</a>  of them is, what has 60 years of this actually done to improve the situation in Cuba? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13636.589s">I</a>  don't think anybody here is denying what the Castro regime did, nor the Diaz-Canel one currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13642.051s">How</a>  is that going? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13643.792s">How</a>  is that democratizing the place? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13646.112s">That's</a>  one really important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13648.473s">to</a>  ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13648.933s">And</a>  I think before people speak on supporting the continuation of this embargo, they should be able to answer how this has brought any democracy forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13659.078s">Just</a>  one last thing, though, as far as the distinction between embargo and blockade, it is true that this is an embargo. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13665.541s">However,</a>  the reason a lot of times that people say it's a blockade is because US government as well puts pressure on additional countries saying, we will not help you financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13676.331s">You</a>  know, if you go and do any kind of deals with Cuba again, like this has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13682.034s">Going</a>  on repeatedly, the United Nations, just like with Gaza, continues to ask the US to stop this, to stop this ridiculous economic warfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13690.457s">And</a>  the US and Israel just keeps voting against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13693.438s">For</a>  why? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13693.858s">And</a>  I think the obvious reason is, I think a lot of us know, is that there are cynical electoral reasons, particularly in Florida. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13700.361s">I</a>  won't go into any more depth, but on the merits, on the merits, the continuation of this embargo simply cannot be justified.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Clerkin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13820.543s">Yeah,</a>  if you need to find me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13823.184s">So</a>  my concern with this, not to take away from any of the testimony from the Gaza issue earlier, it was powerful and it was meaningful. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13835.251s">My</a>  concern is really the precedent that it sends that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13840.006s">If</a>  Gaza or if Cuba are local issues, then what isn't? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13845.151s">You</a>  know, I mean, should we be talking about the Rohingya Muslims? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13848.013s">Should</a>  we be talking about the Uyghurs in China? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13849.975s">Should</a>  we be talking about what's going on in Colombia and Argentina and anywhere in the world? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13855.18s">I</a>  mean, in a sense, yes, but should it be here in these chambers? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13859.183s">I</a>  think that there's <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13860.905s">we</a>  have to start to put some structure in place where, you know, there's personal matters, there's local matters, there's state matters, there's national matters, there's global matters, and they're all important, but, and I completely agree that Medford is not this, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13881.724s">completely</a>  sealed off entity it were affected by by immigration were affected by by technology changes were affected by inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13891.132s">We're</a>  not her medically sealed but. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13895.967s">the</a>  amount of energy that will go into fighting global issues in these chambers will pull energy away from all of these other things that truly are locally confined issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13906.85s">And</a>  it's like the body needs to continue to function. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13909.731s">And</a>  if you pump all the blood towards one organ, then all the other organs start to die. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13913.912s">I</a>  know that's not maybe the best analogy, but it's the best analogy I can think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13918.793s">So</a>  I just wanted to put that on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13920.974s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13923.049s">Thank</a>  you, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13923.629s">I</a>  think it remains to be seen whether it's a zero-sum equation, but your comments are duly noted and appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13929.57s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13931.05s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13936.611s">I</a>  remember like it was yesterday when JFK put the embargo on Cuba with the cruise ship missiles there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13945.553s">We</a>  felt like we were going to get wiped out by nuclear missiles from Russia, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13952.443s">or</a>  the Soviet Union at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13957.564s">I</a>  think it's great to open up relations with Cuba, personally speaking, providing they don't have any military, especially foreign military installations there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13973.046s">And</a>  they don't empty their prisons and their asylums into the continental USA, as they have done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13983.57s">So</a>  saying that, I'm okay with it because Cuban cigars can't be beat.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13995.205s">Name</a>  and address again for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13996.726s">Nate</a>  Merritt, 373 Roofside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=13999.407s">I</a>  guess I'm kind of curious as to why the city of Medford thinks that it knows or should be able to determine whether or not a country should be on the state sponsor of terrorist. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14012.115s">This</a>  country has a wonderful defense and intelligence apparatus that knows more about the terrorist activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14018.078s">than</a>  anyone in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14020.34s">So</a>  I guess I'm just questioning why this city feels like it maybe knows more than the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14027.967s">And</a>  if the motivation behind it is because Trump did something, and therefore we need to unwind what Trump did because it's something Trump did, that's a poor decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14040.998s">Things</a>  happen in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14042.76s">Different</a>  people are in different administrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14045.54s">But</a>  whoever the president is, they're not a dictator in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14049.484s">There's</a>  a whole bunch of staff that work behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14053.147s">So</a>  before you pass something where I think you're kind of ill-posed, I'd really question, really, can you make that judgment to say they should be removed without having the data to back it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14065.439s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14068.496s">It's</a>  embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14069.116s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14069.717s">And</a>  apologies to my colleagues that I'm sitting here and talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14073.88s">Usually</a>  I'm up there quiet, and I'm sure that some of my colleagues appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14081.09s">at</a>  least based on past experience, regardless of any affiliation, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14086.874s">I'm</a>  sure that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14088.335s">I</a>  just want to say a couple things. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14090.597s">One,</a>  there's been a lot of commentary lately. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14093.719s">The</a>  council's so focused on this, they're not going to be able to focus on the other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14099.303s">We</a>  put out a 40-page governing agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14102.469s">with</a>  dozens of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14104.651s">I</a>  appreciate the concern that we're going to focus too much on one thing and not be able to do the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14108.613s">I</a>  just don't believe it to be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14112.716s">The</a>  other thing I want to say just on the specifics, the Obama administration, the defense apparatus, whatever we want to say, they removed Cuba from the state's positive terrorism list. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14124.564s">The</a>  date <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14126.204s">that</a>  the Trump administration put them back on was January 12, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14129.346s">It</a>  was six days after Trump literally tried to be a dictator. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14134.528s">And</a>  he did it on the way out, out of spite, to try to undermine the legacy of his predecessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14140.611s">So,</a>  you know, I'm making kind of a liberal establishment <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14146.394s">you</a>  know, defense intelligence agency argument for this, but the fact that there is one kind of underlies why this is something that should just be passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14153.979s">So</a>  I appreciate the support of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14155.78s">I</a>  hope you vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14157.0s">I</a>  move approval.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14158.541s">Do</a>  I have a second on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14160.663s">Councilor</a>  Callahan? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14163.824s">Do</a>  folks want a roll call vote or is a voice vote fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14168.367s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14169.708s">Would</a>  you prefer? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14170.268s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14171.549s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14172.63s">All</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14173.09s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14177.25s">Motion</a>  passes with one note of dissent.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14191.929s">On</a>  the motion of Council Vice President concert to the regular order of business seconded by Councilor carry and all those in favor of those motion passes <a href="../resolutions/24-025.pdf"><font color="green">24-025</font></a> commercial vacancy tax whereas the city of Medford has many commercial storefronts that are either vacant or <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14209.571s">for</a>  unacceptably long periods of time, or are rarely and inconsistently open for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14213.333s">And</a>  whereas there exists insufficient incentive for the owners of such property to maintain and rent their storefronts to active businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14219.716s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the adoption of a commercial vacancy tax, which can be applied to disincentivize these storefront properties from remaining undocupied indefinitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14230.362s">Be</a>  it further resolved that this matter be referred to committee for further discussion with the Chief Assessor, the Finance Director, and the Economic Development Director, Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14238.615s">Yes,</a>  so is it sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14243.779s">So</a>  I didn't do this with my last motion is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14245.96s">Just</a>  start by motioning to refer to admin finance motion to refer to admin finance on the motion of Council.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14252.304s">Let</a>  me to refer to the administration of the Finance Committee seconded by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14258.43s">Is</a>  there discussion or yes, Councilor Lemme.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14261.474s">So,</a>  this is a so basically going going around Medford, I think it's pretty clear that we have a bit of an issue with vacant storefront properties not only storefront properties like in West Medford that have been <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14276.893s">unoccupied</a>  for a year and a half, going on two years, but also storefront properties that are effective, that are just not open consistently or often. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14292.586s">This</a>  was a policy proposal that I brought up door-to-door continuously when people kept talking about the fact that stores are just not occupied and generally found <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14303.696s">I</a>  couldn't find a single person who actually opposed it when I was going door to door. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14308.5s">Now,</a>  I'm going to be the first to say that this is a nuanced issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14315.086s">The</a>  reason that people choose to create or choose to leave property unoccupied is <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14323.493s">there</a>  could be a lot of different reasons for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14325.514s">And</a>  so I hope that in committee we're able to craft a policy that can incentivize businesses to open up shop to, or sorry, incentivize landlords to open up shop to good businesses around town and thereby boost the revenue in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14346.465s">What</a>  we would like to avoid is <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14349.406s">you</a>  know, businesses just deciding to rent it out to like, you know, a random, a random pawn shop or something so that we just have those springing up left and right around town or just, you know, another another kind of business that I don't want to insult by just bringing up an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14366.979s">But</a>  the point but the point is, like, I don't want to insult pawn shop owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14370.862s">I</a>  shouldn't I shouldn't have said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14373.223s">You</a>  know, but but but yeah, I hope that my point I hope that my never going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14379.994s">Yeah,</a>  I hope I hope that my my point is heard there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14384.935s">But,</a>  uh, you know, uh, in any case, uh, I would just I just think that this is an issue that Medford City Council really needs to, uh, really needs to address and be active about at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14399.218s">So</a>  I welcome any discussion on motion.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14402.97s">on</a>  the motion of Councilor LAMING to proudly insult the business community.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14415.145s">I</a>  apologize to any and all.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14418.908s">I'm</a>  kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14421.729s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Lemons, I think appreciation of the nuance of this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14426.613s">We</a>  definitely have a need to revitalize our squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14430.095s">There</a>  are items later on in the agenda that will help us get at that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14436.96s">We</a>  have passed as a city council last term, numerous items to help us get there and implementing mechanisms to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14448.989s">It's</a>  not wrong to say that we need to do more on the issue, especially of commercial vacancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14457.099s">We</a>  want to be bringing people into the square, into all of our squares, if we don't have populated storefronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14466.309s">we</a>  disincentivize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14468.71s">At</a>  the same time, the nuances of the questions of turnover and the types of businesses that you'll want to see are extremely relevant in discussing this matter as well, which Councilor Leming has noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14481.275s">I've</a>  sat down with the city staff on a few occasions before, both this term and last term, to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14487.137s">this</a>  idea and there are different views of it, but I think broadly the consensus is we should also as a council consider what carrots we want to accompany the stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14499.268s">There</a>  are some potential state mechanisms that we could look into in terms of giving new starting businesses funding to pay for physical improvements, to pay for <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14511.699s">basically</a>  capital costs to operate a new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14515.502s">It</a>  will take a lot of talking to the potential business owners, the landlords, to see why things are the way they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14522.988s">But</a>  if we identify the problems as such, there are different mechanisms that we might be able to introduce as carrots going along with this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14538.339s">Councilor</a>  Scarapelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14539.901s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14543.09s">I</a>  just, and I think that I understand where the motion's, the resolution's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14549.112s">I</a>  think that we just need to be cognizant in the fact that anything that we put forth that companies can look into and say, hey, well, let's take a chance in Medford, but remember if, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14566.917s">it</a>  doesn't work, we're going to, you know, it's going to penalize us in a sense that, you know, being taxed and when then that would lead to what we're talking about and seeing unsavory or <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14582.253s">other</a>  entities entering or being just admitted into each community that would affect us in a negative way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14590.016s">So</a>  I understand the frustration because we have three master plans that we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on for Method Square and nothing's been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14600.221s">We</a>  haven't seen anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14601.601s">So</a>  I know that, as we said, moving forward, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14605.583s">the</a>  helping with some of the zoning changes and the understanding of what we're doing moving forward with the planning department to really see what works in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14617.188s">I</a>  would tend to hold off on some resolution like this until we see a more of a robust plan that the city is hopefully unveiling relatively soon from what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14628.132s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14635.452s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14635.752s">I'll</a>  be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14636.873s">I</a>  thank the Councilor for bringing this forward often, either in meetings or out in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14642.996s">When</a>  we're talking about our business districts or squares, residents ask of Councilors, you know, why is XYZ business square like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14651.981s">Why</a>  is this vacant? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14654.102s">How</a>  can we get X type of business in, you know, XYZ square? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14660.586s">There's</a>  a pretty obvious limit to what a city can instruct commercial landlords to do with their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14667.132s">But</a>  this is one tool that we could consider and possibly enact to try to incentivize our squares being full and lively and they're always being business tenants and available commercial space and so I'm excited to explore it further.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14679.663s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14680.885s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14683.914s">I</a>  just wanted to mention for anyone watching, listening or in the chambers that this is a resolution that simply sends it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14690.077s">This</a>  is an opening of the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14691.978s">So</a>  if people are interested in this topic, please come to the committee meetings where this will be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14697.541s">Same</a>  with the warming center, same with some of these other resolutions that were passed today and maybe passed later today. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14703.524s">This</a>  is really the beginning of the discussion, certainly not the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14707.246s">And</a>  we really encourage people to come to those committee meetings because that is where the sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14711.508s">you</a>  know, meat and potatoes of developing laws for our city comes from.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14718.134s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14718.955s">Councilor</a>  Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14720.036s">Yes,</a>  and I do wish my colleague were still sitting here so that I could respond to some of the points that he brought up, but he seems to have had to step out temporarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14730.204s">But</a>  just to clarify the intent of this, I knocked on someone's door in West Medford, and this person was a business owner, owned some gyms in a couple of other areas, and she told me <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14745.377s">that</a>  she was trying to open up a gym in West Medford, and she had attempted to contact the landlord several different times, and the landlord wouldn't even return her phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14756.248s">Okay,</a>  so speculative squatting, waiting for somebody to give a good price on property, et cetera, is a strategy that landlords do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14770.361s">this</a>  now if the commercial vacancy tax were implemented successfully, it would be applied very rarely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14775.924s">The</a>  intention of something like this would be to get landlords to come to the table and work and work with the economic development director, work with different parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14787.49s">We</a>  do need carrots. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14789.191s">We</a>  also need sticks so that people so that people don't just <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14796.494s">own</a>  properties and get too complacent with them, but they're incentivized in different ways to own commercial storefront property, not just for their own personal gain, but also to beautify the town. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14811.212s">So</a>  the intention of this, and I hope that we can hammer out something in committee that works full <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14816.578s">that</a>  we're trying to do, and I think that's what we're trying to do in both parties is to get something that just gets landlords to the table and understanding that, yes, they do need to rent out something. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14826.665s">Suitable</a>  in the properties that they own. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14828.927s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14830.088s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14830.908s">Any</a>  further comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14837.5s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, are there members of the public who'd like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14839.922s">I</a>  see a hand on Zoom and a hand at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14841.863s">I</a>  will go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14842.743s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14843.984s">Sure</a>  thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14844.504s">Nate</a>  Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14846.225s">I</a>  know it's getting a broken record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14848.867s">So</a>  why I'm actually concerned about this, I'm not a business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14852.83s">It</a>  is a little ambiguous. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14853.91s">Does</a>  it only apply to storefront properties or would it be all commercial and or industrial businesses?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14861.843s">Sir,</a>  I don't think the detail has been worked out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14864.887s">So</a>  that's why it's being referred to committee for further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14867.611s">I'm</a>  actually not sure what the legal mechanisms we have at hand under Massachusetts general law are to implement such a tax, but I think there's an intent behind it, so.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14880.286s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14880.526s">I</a>  mean, the intent.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14881.166s">I</a>  can't ask him. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14881.786s">I</a>  gotta ask you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14882.447s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14882.847s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14883.767s">I</a>  mean, Councilor Leming has kind of stated his intent here, I think relatively clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14887.628s">If</a>  you want to clarify, you're welcome to.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14890.428s">I'd</a>  just like to, not that I'm responding, but I'm addressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14893.629s">Yes,</a>  tell me, what's the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14895.13s">What</a>  do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14896.69s">In</a>  a completely unrelated, completely unrelated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14900.131s">What</a>  do you feel? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14901.231s">Yeah,</a>  just just just totally unrelated to anything happening on this side of the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14904.792s">I</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14905.752s">I</a>  don't really understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14907.113s">But</a>  so the intent of this is to only apply to the commercial storefront property. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14913.076s">It's</a>  just a thought that came to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14914.757s">I</a>  mean, that's a that's a question that I had.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14917.319s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14918.419s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14918.82s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14919.22s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14921.502s">So</a>  and why I was concerned is because right across the street from my house is a vacant commercial property, 400 Riverside Ave, which I was just informed tonight that I guess is not at the moment now being considered for a migrant shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14936.228s">However,</a>  one of the reasons that they're in that situation <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14939.489s">is</a>  because it's a vacant commercial building. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14941.89s">Now,</a>  why it's vacant, I couldn't tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14944.23s">Initially,</a>  it was supposed to be, I think, a biotech company was the intent, which to me is awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14949.552s">I</a>  love commercial business. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14950.512s">I</a>  love private business. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14951.532s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14951.792s">Because</a>  it's a place for people to potentially work in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14956.333s">That's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14956.993s">And</a>  a large space like that is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14960.014s">I</a>  caution if we start having <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14963.519s">sticks,</a>  then people certainly can go out and rent out space. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14967.042s">This</a>  has been demonstrated where Hey, I've got a space, let's make it a migrant shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14970.625s">I</a>  mean, there are plenty of other avenues besides business, right to one, they'd want to get income for that building, but then also to avoid on top of that a potential tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14983.181s">I</a>  really would like to see some sort of plan for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14987.563s">For</a>  instance, city of Malden, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14989.004s">When</a>  I want to go, Justin, I'm looking at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14991.504s">Okay,</a>  when I want to go and get dim sum with my family, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14994.446s">There's</a>  umpteen, you know, Vietnamese, Chinese restaurants, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14997.407s">I</a>  can go to dim sum in I think three or four places, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15000.288s">Not</a>  Songkran, I went to Songkran last weekend, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15004.73s">Because</a>  the other one I can't, the larger one in Malden Center, right, is full, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15012.196s">There</a>  was a plan behind that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15013.737s">I</a>  don't think it was completely random where a bunch of Asian businesses said, hey, I'm going to go put one next to the other on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15021.443s">I</a>  think there was some coordination by the city of Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15026.007s">And</a>  it's a place where young people can actually go and get entertainment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15030.27s">There</a>  really isn't a lot of that here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15032.432s">So</a>  I'd really love to see what a plan for this city is, and including these large industrial and commercial spaces that are vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15039.856s">So</a>  not just at the state level, I think there's a lot of local incentives that we could do to, you know, populate some of these commercial spaces in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15049.241s">So</a>  my caution is be very careful with the sticks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15052.263s">They</a>  may have unintended consequences.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15061.417s">Mayor</a>  Mrakas, you're on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15062.158s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15062.238s">Hello,</a>  Matthew Page Lieberman 15 Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15063.759s">I</a>  very much support this and I appreciate that Councilor Leming has brought this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15067.363s">I</a>  remember when I was looking at this last year, I was trying to come up with some carrots. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15073.648s">So</a>  I very much appreciate that that discussion is already being had as far as all this alarmism that's just <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15082.056s">that's</a>  somewhat of a false dichotomy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15084.798s">However,</a>  I think if we go into the past, we could see how we could greatly benefit by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15090.423s">Since</a>  pawn shops were brought up, quite a few councils back, this is over a decade ago, I guess, the council had decided <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15098.75s">And</a>  the mayor's administration had decided to pull all the funding away from the public access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15103.953s">The</a>  station closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15105.754s">There</a>  was a vacancy in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15109.497s">And</a>  what opened in, what filled, that was a pawn shop, in which the same council would then whine about that there are pawn shops down Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15119.002s">I'm</a>  not attacking them I don't think you know Councilor Lemus, but I mean, even if that's the case, it didn't start tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15125.847s">But</a>  as far as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15127.468s">There</a>  was a point in time when we didn't have public access station we did have a spring step building. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15132.951s">And</a>  one of the Councilors is a while back, so why can't we put the public access station in the spring step. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15138.274s">And</a>  there was this, you know, why can't we why can't we why can't we and there was no innovative thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15143.557s">And</a>  I don't know if anybody knows whatever happened in the spring step, but for a few years after it went under, the building was just owned, person was just sitting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15151.88s">They're</a>  paying very, very little taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15154.16s">And</a>  then they eventually sold it to a nonprofit that does work in Latin America. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15159.302s">And</a>  that person who sold it made millions and millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15162.943s">They're</a>  speculating. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15164.083s">They're</a>  speculating on property that this council wanted to use for their own community, but the council couldn't figure out how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15170.287s">That</a>  costs a lot of tax money for the community, that costs space that we cannot use. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15175.173s">These</a>  ideas are incredibly important so that we can address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15178.077s">And</a>  one last thing, I'm just really happy that down at City Hall, we have a new economic development director. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15186.628s">So</a>  we could all be happy that I expect a lot of ideas and I'm hoping that City Hall can work with the council and we could have really, really thriving business area for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15197.637s">And</a>  as well as incentives, perhaps one of those incentives we could eventually talk about is some little bit of tax breaks for companies that decide to view worker cooperatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15209.107s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15220.47s">One</a>  minute? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15221.631s">You</a>  must be psychic, that's all I need. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15227.255s">At</a>  this hour.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15230.819s">I</a>  don't have the energy to fight him.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15237.844s">I</a>  believe I understand Councilor Matt's idea here, commercial vacancy tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15244.367s">So</a>  the West Bedford Square and other locations can look fuller, like we're all selling on a full apple cart, and it looks better on a retail basis, I presume. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15256.854s">And</a>  this may be an extra additional real estate tax, commercial real estate tax, on top of the existing, I presume. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15267.068s">as</a>  a sort of penalty to push forward someone to rent it out, and make the city look better. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15273.671s">Nate</a>  brought up 398-400 Riverside Avenue, and I believe it was Life Sciences that bought that building a year or two ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15288.578s">My</a>  son used to work there in the machining department. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15295.447s">And</a>  I'm just guessing that I think the life science industry hit the fan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15305.851s">And</a>  he paid, or the entity paid $29 million, I believe, for that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15311.094s">And</a>  his last sold, I think, I forget, and previous to that, it was sold for a dollar, probably father to son, I presume. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15318.657s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15319.949s">And</a>  I believe the entity bought the building behind it, and also the other building behind that, which was Santini Ironworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15328.474s">They've</a>  been in business over 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15330.775s">They</a>  build steel beams to build all these bridges in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15336.179s">But</a>  anyways, they're all empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15337.94s">Of</a>  course, they're not on street level in the front and center. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15345.124s">But</a>  what concerns me more than all of this is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15350.458s">And</a>  I'm generally going to ask if you have an answer and be willing to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15357.382s">I'm</a>  more concerned if the commercial real estate values are crashing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15363.845s">That</a>  is a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15366.326s">Are</a>  they crashing? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15368.167s">Commercial</a>  real estate values, are they crashing as we speak?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15374.358s">As</a>  we speak, I hope not.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15376.699s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15377.779s">Big</a>  time, I hope not.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15379.66s">But</a>  because it's pretty late. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15382.902s">No,</a>  my understanding of the commercial real estate, and again, I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15386.42s">is</a>  that it's mainly focused the value issue is in the downtown areas of major cities like Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15391.824s">I</a>  have not seen, although there is the vacancy at 400 Riverside which is well noted a very large building and office with a warehouse attached but I have not, to my knowledge the assessor has not informed us of any serious devaluation of the commercial properties in the residential is going up.</p>

    <p>[John McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15408.077s">Commercial</a>  we just over 5%.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15409.878s">We</a>  just finished the tax, not just, but in December, we finished the tax rate and the commercial valuation had increased significantly as well.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15415.72s">Yes,</a>  I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15416.28s">My</a>  real estate tax didn't go up prop two and a half style. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15419.561s">It</a>  went up like four, $500. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15422.462s">Again.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15423.242s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15424.923s">Every</a>  year for the last three years, 400, 400, 400.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15431.805s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15433.905s">Mr.</a>  Cassidy, if there's anything.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15435.506s">Yeah,</a>  so what I'm concerned about is for, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15440.114s">17,000</a>  real estate taxpayers, if the commercial real estate is going in the dumps, that means the residential real estate is gonna have a huge increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15458.204s">It's</a>  gonna rise dramatically, big time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15461.145s">This</a>  happened before, and Mr. McGlynn had this meeting at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15467.671s">I</a>  said, well, what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15468.531s">Prop</a>  two and a half, it should only go up like 50 bucks, a hundred dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15472.394s">He</a>  says, Andrew, you had a full house there, high rate residential owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15478.817s">And</a>  he says, it's gonna go up, I think it was like $700 instead of the a hundred bucks usually. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15486.342s">So</a>  I said, what about prop two and a half, Mr. McGlynn, Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15490.324s">He</a>  says, Andrew, good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15491.745s">Because</a>  when the commercial real estate values go down, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15496.803s">We're</a>  gonna get it big time, maybe two, three, four times more increase than normal, which is already $450 for mine last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15506.148s">That's</a>  a scary thought for people with fixed incomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15510.89s">I</a>  don't know if you know about this, if I'm factual, but you might wanna check that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15516.092s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15517.033s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15518.273s">Any</a>  further comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15521.889s">Hearing</a>  none, on the motion of Councilor Leming to refer to administration and finance, seconded by Councilor Callahan earlier, maybe it was Councilor, somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15529.855s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, we have Councilor Callahan, I remembered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15531.576s">The</a>  clerk says I was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15533.117s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15533.797s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15534.698s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15535.679s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="../resolutions/24-026.pdf"><font color="green">24-026</font></a>, Transportation Demand Ordinance.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15541.141s">Whereas</a>  the city of Medford should address high levels of traffic, whereas developers often need to make exceptions to zoning regulations to feasibly develop new buildings, and the current process of passing those to the Zoning Board of Appeals often adds unwanted uncertainty and delays to these processes, whereas a transportation demand management program automates these exceptions and puts them to the staff level by means of a points-based impacts and credits system, and whereas Everett and Boston have implemented a transportation demand management program <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15566.856s">to</a>  great success during development of both commercial and affordable residential property, and whereas a transportation demand management program can provide design and programming strategies that developers can employ to reduce car traffic to and from their buildings, therefore be it resolved <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15580.848s">that</a>  the Medford City Council adopt a transportation demand ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15585.09s">Be</a>  it further resolved that this matter be referred to committee for further discussion with the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15590.752s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the members of the Committee on Planning and Permitting submit questions to the Chair, Clerk, and City staff ahead of the committee meeting scheduled for this subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15598.655s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the Medford City Council work with the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability to evaluate the suitability of a transportation demand management program, determine the capacity of the city to implement such a program, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15609.819s">and</a>  provide specific recommendations for its structure and policies, particularly with respect to the nature of the Medford specific impacts and design of its credit system. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15621.188s">And</a>  I will go to you in one moment, Councilor Leming, but I do want to note that this also came up during our planning and permitting committee meeting discussion on <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15631.82s">the</a>  governing agenda, and we had discussed incorporating this with our larger discussion on the zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15638.763s">Since</a>  some folks and I can't remember what was had talked to planning development sustainability staff, and they felt it would be a good compliment to the zoning to put it in and have our can those consultants work on this as well as part of the comprehensive zoning reform so I just want to let you know that, since we're able to be at the meeting, and the reports just came out recently so. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15658.591s">But</a>  with that I will turn it over to you Council.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15661.434s">So</a>  I was going to motion to refer this to the committee on planning and permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15667.298s">Perfect.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15709.527s">For</a>  our newer members, this is a very contentious situation with the neighbors of the BJ's neighborhood, with the implementation of the new, the building of the new gas station at the corner of Middlesex Street and BJ's entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15726.056s">One</a>  thing that we wanted to make sure we cognizant with the neighbors being informed with everything that's happening so they are not left in the dark like they felt the last 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15743.03s">And</a>  what's been happening, I guess, is the construction work <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15749.96s">they</a>  were setting pylons. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15751.542s">And</a>  as a gym, they were hitting the pylons to set the footings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15755.906s">They</a>  shook houses and neighbors were scared to death. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15761.251s">Nobody</a>  was informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15762.292s">They</a>  let everybody know. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15763.212s">I</a>  give a lot of credit to our court enforcement officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15767.857s">They</a>  ran to the site at 630 that morning and talked to the <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15773.382s">project</a>  manager and he showed him some of the seismology equipment that they've had and said that it's not affecting them, but the neighbors want to have <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15785.097s">would</a>  like to call for meeting with the representative what we did agree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15789.021s">I</a>  believe Council President was that there would be a representative from BJS that would be at our beck and call for our neighbors so if we can reach out to them I don't know where it fell it that it was with the building of the building department, or it was with the mayor's office I don't know who has the. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15805.638s">if</a>  we can ask who that connection is and ask him to come to the next meeting, because I think some of the community members really want their voice heard, and especially the fact that they did tell the code enforcement officer they'll be doing this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15822.572s">in</a>  a few weeks when they set the gas tanks underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15827.395s">So</a>  there'll be more shaking and some other people had some questions with the gas lines that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15833.439s">How</a>  is that affecting it? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15834.719s">And</a>  then we had a call that evening <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15840.074s">a</a>  water main burst in front of one of the residents' homes, and they wanted to see if it's attributed to that type of work that was being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15850.581s">So</a>  I think we need to be super, super delicate with these neighbors, because as one of the members that failed them that night in voting, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15865.185s">in</a>  an irresponsible manner, not knowing the laws and the rules of that night, and not having a city solicitor to protect us, it put us in a really, really bad situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15876.072s">And</a>  whatever we can do for those neighbors, we need to follow through with. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15879.775s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15880.816s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scrivina. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15881.536s">Two</a>  questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15882.557s">When</a>  was the incident? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15884.178s">I</a>  believe it was last Wednesday.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15888.221s">Last</a>  Wednesday, okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15889.422s">And</a>  last Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15892.223s">I</a>  believe the last day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15893.604s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15895.219s">was</a>  Thursday was the last day we were doing this.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15898.583s">And</a>  then they said on Thursday it'll be a couple weeks we're coming back and doing this again.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15904.589s">Even</a>  if by chance we can get at them, reach out to the neighbors in the immediate vicinity of 4th Street, Middlesex, just letting them know that this is what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15915.62s">One</a>  resident said that</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15925.196s">they</a>  were afraid that the way we're shaping the house, they were afraid it would affect their foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15931.858s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15933.058s">So</a>  the further motion from Councilor Scarpelli to immediately refer this, contact the building department to contact the representative from BJ's and also to request a meeting with us, but also to request immediate notification of the surrounding neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15952.105s">All</a>  right, that's their daily activities.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15954.486s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15954.686s">Mr.</a>  Court, do you have that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15955.587s">Appreciate</a>  that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15956.967s">Most</a>  of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15959.188s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15959.468s">And</a>  we'd like that to go out as soon as possible given the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15962.51s">So</a>  maybe before the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15965.471s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15965.831s">And</a>  then I will go to Councilor Callahan, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15968.873s">Was</a>  there anyone over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15969.973s">All</a>  right, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15972.526s">I</a>  just wanted to mention that in one of the committees, perhaps you can remind me which one, we were talking about the importance of holding companies accountable for any damages that they do, or for following through on their promises of things that they've committed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15987.636s">And</a>  I see this as part of that ongoing work, but we will be, as a city, we will be doing more to be proactive about these kinds of things.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15996.362s">Absolutely,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15998.103s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15999.433s">I</a>  wanted to thank Councilor Scarpelli for introducing this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16003.916s">I</a>  wanted to second it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16006.338s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli and I talked, I think on Wednesday, about how we both called the building department staff over to notify, to talk to them, get some sort of solution out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16016.224s">I</a>  think Councilor Scarpelli has really gotten to the root of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16020.066s">We</a>  were promised a liaison. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16022.688s">We</a>  don't know who the liaison is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16024.109s">We</a>  haven't been, who they report to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16028.772s">the</a>  community members deserve so much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16031.115s">And</a>  while there are a lot of aspects of this project that we were powerless to stop, it just means that we need to do even more diligence on the other parts of this project.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16041.888s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16044.471s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16048.402s">on</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as further amended by Councilor Scarpelli, to refer immediately to the building department for a response, as well as to refer to BJ's for us to have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16061.225s">Is</a>  that to committee of the whole? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16063.166s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16065.886s">Regular</a>  meeting, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16068.407s">So</a>  we'll send it, there's a motion to send it to building department for immediate response. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16072.488s">And</a>  then also we will put it on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16077.827s">We'll</a>  table it, so we'll take two votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16079.707s">And</a>  if we have it on the table, then we can take it back up in regular session. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16084.429s">So</a>  on the first motion to refer the question to the building department for an immediate response and to notify abutters of further construction, that was Councilor Scarapelli, seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16096.311s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16097.072s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16098.072s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16099.792s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16100.973s">On</a>  the motion to table the paper, so it's on the agenda so we can take it back up at a regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16108.427s">by</a>  motion by Councilor Tseng seconded by Councilor Collins all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16112.229s">I</a>  oppose motion passes 23<a href="../resolutions/24-033.pdf"><font color="green">24-033</font></a> offered by President Bears and Vice President Collins be resolved by the Medford City Council at the planning and permitting committee invite staff from the office of planning and sustainability and associates the Medford City Council zoning consultant to discuss our upcoming comprehensive review and update of the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16132.96s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16135.626s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears this is kind of a procedural resolution to formally begin the zoning project which has been in a crescendo for longer than I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16149.443s">Right</a>  at the end of the previous term into the start of the new one we officially the city officially brought on the zoning consultant that this council selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16157.707s">So</a>  this is to assign the zoning project a new paper number and formally submit it to the planning and permitting committee so we can begin meeting with relevant staff and our zoning consultant to dive into that work in earnest on a motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16173.513s">The</a>  motion by Councilor Collins seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to refer the paper to the planning and permitting committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16184.037s">All</a>  those and that's right right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16186.078s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16187.879s">Opposed</a>  motion passes. <a href="../resolutions/24-034.pdf"><font color="green">24-034</font></a>.

 <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16220.049s">One,</a>  complete inventory of city-owned properties and city-managed properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16223.611s">Two,</a>  cost to restore each property on the above inventory to a state of good repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16227.693s">Three,</a>  cost to maintain each property in a state of good repair once restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16231.215s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the Public Works and Facilities Committee invite the Facilities Manager to present and discuss the above report once completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16238.433s">Chair</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16239.453s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16240.254s">Um,</a>  yes, as I mentioned earlier today in this committee, we have discussed getting updates from the administration on roads on sidewalks and on all publicly owned buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16253.719s">We</a>  also have a new facilities manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16256.0s">So</a>  we feel this is a really nice way for them to get <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16262.563s">themselves</a>  situated in terms of what all of the city owned buildings are, what state of repair they're in, how much might cost to repair them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16270.765s">So,</a>  this is just something that we're, you know, putting forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16275.867s">And</a>  we think that it will both be beneficial to the city and also be beneficial to the facilities manager.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16282.008s">The</a>  motion to refer the public works and facilities committee by Councilor Cohen second by Councilor Tseng any further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16288.49s">Members</a>  of the public yes Mr. Gasconetti.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16296.468s">I</a>  think this is great that Councilor Bearsley brought this forward because maintenance is key, I've said many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16307.754s">And</a>  furthermore, the McGlynn School, I'm not sure if anyone here knows it, but it's been leaking for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16318.299s">It's</a>  only a 23-year-old building, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16323.203s">That's</a>  when I asked for the bike path to be built from those schools to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16329.068s">And</a>  finally, it looks like it's getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16330.89s">I'm</a>  impressed so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16333.312s">But</a>  the point is, there's over 7,000 wood frame homes in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16338.597s">I'm</a>  guesstimating. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16340.699s">And</a>  it seems like they're all still standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16345.248s">And</a>  most of the people back 70, 80, 90, 100 years ago when they were built, most of them were legal immigrants, and they didn't make much cash, salary-wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16357.755s">But</a>  yet, they kept them afloat, and they're still standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16362.117s">So</a>  it hurts me to think, I remember when they built the Method Library in 59, and it seems like 63 years later, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16373.419s">A</a>  brick and mortar building is condemned and they had to rebuild it for 30 million plus two from Bloomberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16379.763s">And</a>  if you see the configuration of the two or three roofs, it's like an invitation for snow and leaks to occur, in my humble opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16392.15s">I'm</a>  not a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16394.171s">So</a>  the police station, same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16396.853s">I</a>  remember being a customer there back in 63 when that was built, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16407.226s">And</a>  I told my friends, it was their fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16413.012s">They</a>  weren't quick on their feet like I was.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_57]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16415.935s">So</a>  they ratted me out.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16419.258s">That</a>  was five, six years before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16423.202s">So</a>  what I'm trying to say is, if I cut out the Milwaukee, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16432.247s">brick</a>  and mortar buildings owned by the city of Medford, our most precious assets are not being taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16439.833s">And</a>  we don't need no debt overrides, a prop two and a half overrides, debt exclusions.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16447.298s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16450.401s">Mr.</a>  Merritt.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16451.241s">I'll</a>  make it quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16452.603s">Just</a>  one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16454.004s">Sorry,</a>  I can't ask you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16455.565s">Ask</a>  me and I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16457.346s">Sure</a>  thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16459.907s">What</a>  about considering if the buildings can't be fixed, maybe it's worth selling the property as a revenue generator for the city, if it makes sense, as a possibility, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16471.795s">Versus</a>  if something's really bad and you'd have to tear it down and rebuild it, and you don't know what the city would wanna do with it, maybe it's in a location that's desirable to put something else, be it residential, commercial, industrial, I have no idea, but just as an option four in your list.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16487.975s">Sure,</a>  yeah, and I'll go to Councilor Callahan in just a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16490.417s">I</a>  think we'd certainly be open to the assessment that it's not worth the existing city capacity to restore it to a state of good repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16497.802s">So</a>  I hear you there, Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16500.163s">This</a>  resolution really is all about just getting the information that we need to make decisions like that in the future.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16504.526s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16506.087s">Personally,</a>  I don't think we should sell public land, but maybe a land swap of some kind could be good, but that's neither here nor there until it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16518.655s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16521.756s">On</a>  the motion.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16716.834s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16717.774s">And</a>  I do apologize to my fellow Councilors for bringing this back to the table, especially at this late hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16723.217s">But</a>  to leave the meeting in good conscience, going into this meeting, having studied the resolution, having talked to advocates for it, I went in planning to support its passage tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16731.141s">My</a>  vote to send it to committee, I think, was more of my personal vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16738.564s">was</a>  more out of going with the flow than what was really in my plan or what was in my heart for this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16744.231s">So</a>  I don't know if it will change the outcome, but I personally <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16748.666s">would</a>  like to retake that vote and have another opportunity to cast my vote for whether we should pass it symbolically tonight as an endorsement of the decriminalization policy, or if it is still the will of the council to send it to committee for further discussion.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16763.332s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16764.893s">Motion</a>  to move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16766.394s">Motion</a>  to move the...

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16789.837s">A</a>  motion to amend to approve and have the police chief report back.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16794.479s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Leming, are you comfortable with amending your motion to approve to also include that the police chief will report back to the council on the recommendation of the resolution?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16808.366s">So</a>  would the, wait, so to be clear, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16812.679s">we</a>  would pass it and then the police chief would come back with his recommendations.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16817.52s">His</a>  response to the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16819.44s">Sure,</a>  that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16820.54s">All</a>  right, so seeing that everyone's cool with that, or at least the two motioners, the two petitioners seem to be acceptable on the motion to approve the paper <a href="../resolutions/24-021.pdf"><font color="green">24-021</font></a>, a resolution supporting adult access and education for plant medicine as amended by Councilor Tseng to request a response from the chief of police to the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16842.364s">Is</a>  there anything beyond that? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16844.465s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16845.805s">Is</a>  there a discussion on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16848.406s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>
