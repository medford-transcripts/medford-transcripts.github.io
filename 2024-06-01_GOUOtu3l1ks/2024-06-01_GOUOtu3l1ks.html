    <p>[SPEAKER_75]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=828.717s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=829.517s">My</a>  name is Judy Lonergan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=831.158s">I</a>  live at 34 Lincoln Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=833.839s">I'd</a>  like to give you a brief history of what happened and why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=838.742s">In</a>  1999, a group of Medford women decided that they wanted to run a function, an event, to recognize the fact that the song Jingle Bells was written in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=848.246s">We</a>  decided that it would be a free event that anyone in the community could attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=853.249s">We</a>  had plans in place, but we had no place to hold it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=859.193s">I</a>  went to see Mayor McGlynn, who at the time I was not really that friendly with. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=863.295s">I</a>  explained our problem to him, and I asked him if he could think of a place. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=867.738s">He</a>  brought me into the council chamber and said that we could have it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=871.4s">That's</a>  how it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=872.801s">This</a>  festival started in 1999 when Community Family purchased the historical old railroad station on Washington Street from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=881.829s">My</a>  husband, John, was on the board at that time and suggested that Community Family become the beneficiary of this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=889.115s">Community</a>  Family is the first licensed adult care facility in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=894.139s">Before</a>  they purchased the railroad station, the program was held in the basement of the West Medford Baptist Church for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=900.722s">This</a>  agency provides direct service care to those who have been diagnosed with severe Alzheimer's. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=906.964s">They</a>  provide medically-based services along with transportation activities and meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=912.467s">I</a>  don't need to tell you that services like this keep our loved ones, friends, and neighbors aging in their homes where they want to be, not institutionalized in a skilled nursing home facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=924.275s">There</a>  are three community family centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=926.657s">One</a>  is in Everett, one is in Melrose, and the Medford Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=929.939s">The</a>  Medford Center caters to those affected with highest level of Alzheimer's. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=935.644s">Clients</a>  leave to go either to a nursing home or they die. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=939.587s">The</a>  festival has grown in size every year, and over these 25 years, we have been able to donate almost $450,000 due to the generosity of sponsors, ads, donors, and chances. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=952.901s">They</a>  use the proceeds to assist with the purchase of vans, construct a new kitchen, develop a large outdoor space where the clients can spend time in nice weather, and help to renovate the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=965.167s">This</a>  event is free to any family to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=968.629s">If</a>  they want to purchase chances, they can buy 20 for $5, and then the prices go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=973.971s">This</a>  year, a mother came in with two children, and she bought chances with four single dollars and four quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=981.775s">But</a>  it gave her the opportunity to have her children be involved in an event for Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=987.04s">And</a>  this is the biggest event in Medford for this Christmas holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=991.364s">And</a>  if someone came in and they couldn't even afford $5, they would be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=995.728s">We</a>  would do whatever we could to help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=997.97s">Our</a>  volunteers decorate City Hall for the month of December, which is still out there, and the city uses our decorations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1006.016s">The</a>  festival starts on Wednesday night for the lighting of the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1009.659s">Afterwards,</a>  everyone is invited inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1011.94s">These</a>  women work for seven solid days on the set, setting up, decorating, and cleaning up on Monday after summer volunteers in City Hall spend 40 hours <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1025.794s">having</a>  this function be extremely successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1029.817s">The</a>  festival does not cost the city one cent other than the use of this chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1035.06s">We</a>  have purchased the tablecloth as well as paying for the rental of all the tables and chairs and paying for the janitorial services. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1042.886s">It</a>  has recently been brought to our attention that some members of this city council do not want us to use City Hall any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1049.91s">One</a>  feels that it is disruptive and one feels that we are not inclusive enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1054.173s">We</a>  have had <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1056.024s">Members,</a>  we have been always on display for chances. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1059.065s">We</a>  have included every church, the Buddhist Center, the Royal House, Chevalier, most recently the new library as part of the tours on Saturday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1067.908s">This</a>  year, Barbara Rothstein, who is an active member of the temple, had her home on the tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1073.63s">What</a>  reason does this council have to desire that the event be discontinued? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1078.652s">We</a>  hope that you will reconsider and allow this community event to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1083.013s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1084.074s">Thank</a>  you, Judy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1090.609s">I'm</a>  going to recognize Councilor Scarpelli in just a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1095.532s">Could</a>  you not hear Judy? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1096.333s">I</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1102.017s">Just</a>  want to say, you know, I don't think the intent of this council whatsoever is to move or cancel the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1106.78s">I</a>  can't speak for where those rumors have come from, but they have not come from this council or any official statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1114.232s">Well,</a>  they are not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1116.213s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1116.993s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1117.353s">So</a>  I know that, first of all, I care very deeply for a lot of our members. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1123.756s">I</a>  respect you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1124.936s">And</a>  I will tell you that having deep conversations with my fellow Councilors, that's not the intent of this Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1131.599s">we'll</a>  do everything that needs to be done to make sure that event comes through every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1137.665s">It's</a>  too important for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1139.327s">In</a>  today's society, where we lack a true sense of community at times, that event brings everybody together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1145.433s">So</a>  I don't know where where that might have come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1147.915s">But</a>  I will tell you, we will work hard together as a board to make sure that that's not something that's going to ever be forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1153.981s">And</a>  and we understand how hard you work. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1156.463s">And</a>  I think that comes that evening that happens a lot of miscommunication and a lot of misunderstanding what was coming from the administration, the council, and your organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1166.911s">So</a>  I think all it says is really having an open line of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1171.455s">I</a>  know that Judy's working really hard with the mayor's office to set up a meeting with different clergy and different churches. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1177.179s">I</a>  know that the council president would probably love to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1179.881s">to</a>  make sure that we're all together to make sure that this is an all-inclusive and a true celebration the way that you intended for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1187.248s">I</a>  think that you know I brought my kids to the event when they were babies and it's something that to this day they still remember the Christmas trees and not for what what <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1197.558s">what</a>  the symbol of it but what it meant for the city and that was really unifying us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1201.841s">So</a>  I think that we so appreciate everything you do and I appreciate that you even had to come up here and share what you had to because there might have been some negative <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1216.89s">I'm</a>  glad you were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1219.031s">I'm</a>  glad that we got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1220.012s">We</a>  had a chance to speak, get the word out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1222.933s">And</a>  really, I think most importantly, is rally around as a council as an organization as a city to do more of these type of functions, because they're so important to what we're doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1234.877s">I</a>  mean, you want to talk about we have a room full of people that want to that are looking for true inclusion and peace and happiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1240.659s">And</a>  I think that you're you're <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1243.539s">You're</a>  the originators. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1245.34s">You've</a>  been doing this before people were looking for where to look, where there's peace and love and happiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1251.765s">So</a>  you are, in my eyes, the cornerstone of what we all should fight for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1259.85s">So</a>  again, I'm sorry that there was any negative words that came out in discussions, but rest assured, I've talked to Council President <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1270.267s">We're</a>  gonna work very hard to make sure this doesn't change. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1273.027s">And</a>  now, I think that it's out there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1276.348s">I</a>  would love to see so many other of our churches and our synagogues and our different affiliations and partners throughout the community really rally around this event so we can use this as a true teaching moment for everybody and really celebrate that amazing event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1294.511s">I</a>  know that still hundreds of kids show up every year <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1299.632s">And</a>  you didn't mention how much money goes out, Mrs. Lonergan, but I know you're talking to the hundreds of thousands that were raised and that were distributed to so many families that needed it and so many organizations that need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1313.824s">And</a>  I think it's to the point now, we don't have enough room for the people that want to donate Christmas trees so they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1320.71s">And</a>  what's the intent of the tree? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1322.392s">People</a>  don't realize you can hold what? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1325.074s">more</a>  prizes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1326.214s">So</a>  you get more money and more donations that can come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1329.015s">So</a>  that's one of the intents for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1330.756s">I</a>  think that people didn't realize how important that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1333.537s">It's</a>  really just a mechanism to really stress the importance of gathering funds to support different initiatives throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1342.94s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1345.573s">You</a>  know how I feel about all of you personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1347.454s">I've</a>  known all of you probably my whole life, and I think that I'm proud to call you my friend, but I will tell you, as a council, I didn't hear, I haven't heard one negative thing moving forward with anything we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1359.279s">I</a>  think we're all one team, making sure that we're gonna spread this love. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1362.961s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1364.482s">Yes,</a>  and I know how many gifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1366.383s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Sanford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1369.226s">I</a>  know how many gifts go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1370.387s">I</a>  know I was a youth volunteer at the Buddy Cohalent Center myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1374.411s">My</a>  family has faced the tragedy of Alzheimer's, so I understand how important it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1378.835s">If</a>  there's any meetings that I can represent the council at, I'd be happy to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1382.979s">From</a>  here on out, we're gonna keep it to two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1384.86s">Judy</a>  had a petition, so she went in advance, but name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1388.143s">Loretta</a>  Tusa, 45 Metcalf Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1391.066s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli for your words. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1394.309s">and</a>  to the council, who I hope is gonna support us wholeheartedly in this effort that's been going on for over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1400.671s">I</a>  have a little speech, won't take long, couple of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1404.113s">I'm</a>  a retired 37-year educator of the Medford Public Schools, former board member of Medford Health Matters, and a member of the Jingle Bell Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1414.997s">I</a>  would like to address the use of City Hall to host the festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1420.675s">It</a>  is the Medford residents who through their federal taxes, state taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, local food tax, and community taxes fund the operation of the House of the People City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1439.727s">And</a>  on a final note, the festival committee here has, over the last 20 plus years, given their heart, souls, time, and money to raise thousands of dollars to fund the community center to provide a warm and welcoming place for seniors with special needs to spend their time comfortably. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1460.124s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity to express my thoughts.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1476.189s">Hello,</a>  everybody.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1477.03s">Hi,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1478.791s">My</a>  name is Angela Sperduto, 27 Memorial Way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1481.752s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1485.494s">Hello,</a>  my name is Angela Sperduto. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1488.176s">I've</a>  been a member of the Jingle Bell Festival for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1493.019s">My</a>  dad, Cosmo Sperduto, was a client at the Community Family Adult Day Health Center for almost a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1501.504s">The</a>  love I have for my father could not be put into words. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1506.175s">He</a>  was the most important person in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1510.936s">He</a>  had late stage advanced Alzheimer's. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1513.497s">He</a>  lost his motor skills and ability to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1517.338s">Alzheimer's</a>  disease is the most common type of dementia that not only affects your loved one, it affects the whole entire family. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1527.02s">As</a>  the primary caregiver of my dad, the physical and mental demands became very overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1533.697s">To</a>  see my dad, who was so strong mentally and physically, become a shell of himself was more than most can handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1543.068s">Not</a>  knowing where to turn for help, I was recommended to look into the community family for help and care for my dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1551.783s">Having</a>  to work every day as well as providing 24-hour care for my dad, this center was my savior. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1560.828s">I</a>  refused to put my dad into a long-term facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1564.67s">They</a>  educated me on the disease and the progression of its long-term daily effects to the brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1571.053s">As</a>  they provided knowledge on the financial and legal issues that are involved with the Alzheimer's patient. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1578.578s">He</a>  needed 100%, 24-hour care, never to be left alone, as he would be a danger to himself, and most importantly, other people.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1587.994s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1588.154s">Peduto,</a>  you have 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1589.636s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1590.959s">Anyway,</a>  the staff displayed a genuine concern for my dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1595.761s">They</a>  called me many times with issues regarding my dad's health. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1600.543s">Every</a>  time they were concerned about his health, they prevented more health issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1604.725s">I</a>  could not have asked for more kindness and professionalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1607.906s">They</a>  truly became a second family to me, showing me love and emotional support until his passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1613.996s">I</a>  want to thank them from the bottom of my heart, as I will always be a member of this festival, and I want to give back as long as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1620.923s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1621.884s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_48]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1638.016s">My</a>  name is Val Camilio. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1640.097s">I</a>  live in 223 Lawrence Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1642.479s">I'm</a>  here in support of the continuation of the Jingle Bell Festival held here every year at Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1650.184s">It's</a>  difficult to take care of someone who suffers from dementia or Alzheimer's. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1655.867s">It</a>  is not an ordinary 24-hour day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1658.429s">It</a>  is a 24-hour day of worry, stress, and what's about to come for them and the caregiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1664.733s">People</a>  who suffer from these disorders require constant supervision, you know preparation personal hygiene care and more families look for any outside support, help and services for their loved ones, much like a child daycare program, but they can be very costly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1683.94s">My</a>  mom was 78 years old when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1688.025s">As</a>  much as that family tried to care for her needs, it became impossible and difficult as we had our own families to care for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1695.874s">At</a>  the time my dad was 88 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1698.857s">And</a>  he did the best he could preparing nutritious meals and trying to keep her occupied and entertained. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1704.219s">It</a>  soon became too much of a test for him as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1707.18s">We</a>  looked for services in the area, and finally found community family in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1712.202s">It</a>  was a relief to find temporary help allowing me and my family members, some comfort during our busy working days. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1722.852s">We</a>  took mom to visit community family, and the administrator was welcoming, kind, warm, and attentive to my mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1729.379s">My</a>  apprehensive mother looked at me and whispered, all these people are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1736.006s">In</a>  reality, the people were both young and old, men and women, rich and poor, and of mixed ethnicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1744.695s">So</a>  you see, Alzheimer's does not discriminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1748.817s">On</a>  her first day, the administrator knew my mom loved to cook. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1752.539s">So</a>  she took my mom into the kitchen and asked her if she would like to prepare lunch for the guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1757.541s">My</a>  mom was eager to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1759.602s">She</a>  became a community family member for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1763.085s">She</a>  started three days a week and eventually went to four. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1766.247s">My</a>  mom actually thought she was working there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1768.768s">The</a>  staff at the facility were kind, patient and caring to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1772.951s">They</a>  also had a nurse on staff, and beyond administering medications, she would even give baths for those who needed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1780.882s">They</a>  had wonderful days planned with activities, games, singing songs, exercise, nutritious lunch and snacks, and they celebrated everyone's birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1789.485s">In</a>  addition to the wonderful care provided to our community, family provided transportation to and from the facility if it was needed, with a van that was purchased from monies received from the Jingle Bell Festival.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1802.651s">Ma'am,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1803.391s">Your</a>  time is up, but your message has been heard.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1866.348s">Thank</a>  you ma'am.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1875.97s">Councilor</a>  Tseng I'll be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1877.391s">I</a>  think it's really important to clarify that this council has no plans has had no plans and we'll have no plans to cancel the jingle ball event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1886.077s">I</a>  believe that this arises out of a misunderstanding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1890.774s">of</a>  miscommunication that happened a few months ago, but having spoken to some, at least the councillors I've spoken to, there are no plans to cancel this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=1900.157s">And</a>  the council supports the mission of the Jingle Bell event as well.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2252.735s">Resolution</a>  to support adult access and education for plant medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2258.539s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Leming and Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2261.866s">Whereas</a>  the so-called war on drugs has led to unnecessary penalization, arrest, and incarceration of vulnerable people, particularly people of color and people of limited financial means, rather than prioritizing harm reduction policies to treat drug abuse as an issue of public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2275.131s">And</a>  whereas ethniogenic plants and fungi such as psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca, ibogaine, and mescaline-containing cacti have been shown by peer-reviewed studies and indigenous practice to be beneficial, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2286.335s">for</a>  treating spiritual trauma, addiction, PTSD, depression, terminal illness, anxiety, and cluster headaches, among other conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2293.044s">And</a>  whereas, on average, we lose one of our neighbors in the Commonwealth to opioid overdose every week, as thousands of people we love struggle with addictions that ethniogenic plant medicine has been shown to alleviate, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2304.296s">And</a>  whereas seven Massachusetts communities, Somerville, Cambridge, Northampton, Easthampton, Amherst, Salem, and Provincetown, and nearly two dozen cities nationwide have passed measures directing an end to arrests for growing and sharing these plant medicines, embracing their inferred constitutional right to regulate public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2318.46s">That</a>  is outlined in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2319.62s">Department</a>  of Justice's Cole Memorandum that permitted localities to deprioritize enforcement of cannabis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2324.981s">Oh</a>  boy, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hereby maintains the use and possession of all controlled substances should be understood first and primarily as an issue of public health and by all town entities and that no Medford employees should use any should emanate to city resources, city entities and city resources to assist in enforcement of laws criminalizing personal controlled substance possession. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2347.54s">Is</a>  there a motion to waive the remainder of the reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2349.804s">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2350.605s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2354.132s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2354.833s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2355.554s">Councilor</a>  Leming?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2357.503s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2358.764s">So</a>  this is, I'd like to thank the council for considering this very long text. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2365.952s">Essentially,</a>  this is just a resolution to decriminalize plant-based medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2371.539s">You</a>  know, these are not the same as opioids that cause a public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2378.426s">They</a>  are non-addictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2379.887s">They</a>  have been shown to be able to treat things like PTSD and addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2386.01s">This</a>  has already been done, as it said, by seven other Massachusetts communities, so we would be the eighth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2391.954s">This</a>  is meant to first encourage local law enforcement to deprioritize this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2400.138s">I</a>  don't believe that this council has the authority to outright <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2403.08s">to</a>  decriminalize it, and it is meant to support the state-level initiative to do just that, which is currently being sponsored in the Massachusetts Senate by Senator Jalen. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2415.391s">Just</a>  to clarify one part of this and offer a little bit of context is in the part of the reading that was waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2423.799s">This</a>  resolution calls that the Bedford City Council, sorry, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2428.543s">to</a>  do well so okay so basically there are there's just for a little bit of context there are a couple of different ways to decriminalize this one of them and another avenue that is currently being pursued is a signature collection method which would basically create a an unelected commission that would add its own that if passed in massachusetts would add its own regulation to these plant medicines this has already been passed in <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2458.291s">Oregon,</a>  and long story short, it's made the price of these plant medicines go between $1,000 and $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2465.316s">So</a>  doing things this way through elected representatives would just help to decriminalize it and not create this sort of artificial price. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2476.683s">So</a>  I think that this is a very important step forward to creating a nuanced and science-backed drug policy in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2485.549s">And</a>  I'd like to thank this council for considering it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2488.971s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2489.872s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2492.194s">Councilor</a>  Leming spoke quite well on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2495.297s">Really,</a>  this is a, remember, this is a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2497.579s">This</a>  is not an ordinance that we are passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2499.661s">This</a>  is a statement of the views of the council on not prioritizing our law enforcement to spend resources, to arrest and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2515.336s">you</a>  know, sent for incarceration, people who simply have possession of such controlled substances. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2524.26s">So</a>  given that and what Councilor Leming said, I believe this resolution is a fairly reasonable state and there are many other cities that have passed something very similar.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2537.276s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2538.377s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2539.879s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Villescaz. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2541.06s">I</a>  think any time that we present a resolution or an ordinance that has a level of detail that we talk about law enforcement, I think it'd be prudent for us to maybe send this to subcommittee, invite the chief or someone in his stead to give us their input as our, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2559.361s">the</a>  city of Method to make sure that what we're voting on has the best interests of our police department and our safety of our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2570.956s">I</a>  think that it would be, um, it would be, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2577.119s">a</a>  prudent solution to move this forward to get a little bit more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2582.982s">What</a>  I read is, you know, it's information that's gathered, but I'd like to get more information before I would vote on this and really get the input of the chief where it's mentioned a few times that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2598.035s">the</a>  ramifications through the police department and getting their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2601.876s">So</a>  I would recommend that we would move this to one of the subcommittees, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2608.518s">I</a>  said a motion to refer to the public health and community safety.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2612.579s">That'd</a>  be perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2613.419s">And</a>  with that ask a representative from the police department there to share their input.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2617.8s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2618.161s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2618.361s">With</a>  the representative from the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2620.801s">Seconded</a>  by councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2621.902s">Is</a>  there further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2622.902s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_65]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2627.961s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2629.622s">I</a>  appreciate my fellow Councilors for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2631.723s">I</a>  certainly will be comfortable supporting the resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2633.945s">I</a>  think it's also fine to discuss it more with relevant stakeholders and community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2639.008s">For</a>  me, putting aside the medical and therapeutic uses associated with psychedelic plants, it's certainly not my belief that drug-related arrests and prosecutions should be a law enforcement priority, except when it comes to <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2650.535s">some</a>  of the things specifically exempted in the resolution, such as unauthorized commercial sale, distribution of minors, driving under the influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2659.978s">Recent</a>  history, I mean, not so recent history has shown us that criminalization of substances does not meaningfully advance public health and public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2667.56s">At</a>  the same time, this is a holistic issue, so I look forward to future discussion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2671.482s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2672.662s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2682.09s">Was</a>  your microphone on? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2684.111s">It's</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2684.612s">The</a>  light's on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2690.335s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2690.695s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2691.055s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2692.036s">Shane.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2694.417s">Thank</a>  you, Shane. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2695.198s">Shane</a>  said yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2695.838s">You</a>  couldn't hear him either, but I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2698.76s">Any</a>  further comment from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2702.482s">Sorry,</a>  Mr. Cassidy, one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2705.29s">Seeing</a>  none, we will take public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2707.091s">Two</a>  minutes each on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2708.492s">If</a>  you'd like to speak on this issue, you may line up at the podium or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2711.913s">We</a>  will alternate between the podium and Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2714.354s">Two</a>  minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2719.045s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2828.038s">And</a>  I apologize that we, I've been working on an RFP to fix the sound system in this room for several months, and I'm very frustrated that it hasn't been done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2835.204s">We</a>  do have hearing assistance devices available, and I believe the City Messenger and our videographer can provide those to assist if the sound quality in the room is not sufficient for people who are in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2849.555s">No</a>  hands on Zoom, so we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2851.217s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2854.076s">I'll</a>  speak loud so everyone can hear me too. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2856.999s">My</a>  name is James Davis and I live at 9 Cardington Street in Boston in Roxbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2864.427s">And</a>  over the past two years, I've had the pleasure of meeting your neighbors, knocking on their doors, standing outside your lovely supermarkets to discuss psilocybin mushrooms and plant medicines. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2876.559s">They</a>  are nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2878.12s">They</a>  are parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2879.381s">They</a>  are fellow baseball coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2881.663s">They</a>  are people who have found unbelievable healing from these plant medicines in a way that pharmaceutical drugs have not offered people an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2893.251s">Psilocybin</a>  mushrooms are the most studied pharmacological compound in US history, with thousands of studies published on their benefits and indigenous uses prior to their criminalization in 1970. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2907.399s">In</a>  fact, they were criminalized because a whole generation that was being sent to Vietnam to die and fight a war that they did not agree with, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2916.991s">The</a>  government saw criminalizing cannabis and psychedelics as a way to target certain people politically. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2924.477s">And</a>  indeed, it has. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2926.438s">That's</a>  the history of US drug policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2930.261s">A</a>  study of 44,000 Americans found that a single use of psilocybin mushrooms reduces the risk of opiate use disorder by 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2940.569s">We</a>  are finding first responders, active military members, who are finding unbelievable relief by taking even microdoses that do not have hallucinogenic effects.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2952.098s">You</a>  have 30 seconds, Mr. Davis.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2953.84s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2955.101s">For</a>  me, for my brother, for my family, and for Medford families that are struggling with addiction to alcohol, with addiction to food, this is a godsend. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2965.509s">And</a>  by decriminalizing this, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2967.731s">You're</a>  saying to the people who are already growing their mushrooms, who are already talking to their therapist about it, that you don't want them to go to jail, and that this public health issue should not be a criminal one. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2981.739s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2982.679s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2983.18s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the public or members on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2992.685s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, I'll go to any member in the room who would like to speak at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2999.667s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3064.261s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3065.802s">Any</a>  further comments from members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3069.364s">I</a>  see Grace Parker on Zoom, and then I'll come back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3076.828s">Grace,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3078.268s">You</a>  have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3116.668s">Thank</a>  you, Grace, and a model of a quick comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3119.31s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3122.353s">podium.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3122.773s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3212.48s">I</a>  will go to Councilor Leming and then Councilor Kelly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3215.626s">I</a>  just want to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3218.307s">So</a>  the US military is regulated federally. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3223.45s">So</a>  I am personally subject to urinalysis several times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3226.772s">So</a>  I haven't personally tried these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3229.053s">But</a>  in my day job, I'm also a neuroscientist. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3233.876s">So</a>  I don't study plant medicine directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3237.137s">So</a>  my colleagues have. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3238.618s">And</a>  I've talked with experts who have also <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3244.361s">uh</a>  specialize in this themselves so I would so I think that if you know if this were to go to committee for further discussion we like um I guess I guess my I guess my <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3261.142s">My</a>  concern with that is that this is more of a statewide issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3269.125s">And</a>  so it's really trying to support it at that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3275.747s">I</a>  would assume that if seven other Massachusetts towns have also passed similar resolutions, then they're <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3284.15s">their</a>  law enforcement is not so uniquely different from Medford that Medford has some unique public health considerations specific to this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3294.996s">So</a>  I and you know, if it were all if it were referred to committee, I would also encourage us to speak not only to law enforcement, but to also, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3303.681s">public</a>  health experts, people who specifically study this, people who specifically study this, and other stakeholders as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3312.826s">I</a>  personally would like it to be voted on tonight, but obviously if that isn't the will of this council, then it would go to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3324.633s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3326.24s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3327.361s">As</a>  a co sponsor of this, it clearly is important to me that we do consider the spirit of what we're trying to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3337.052s">But</a>  I also want to mention that this is a fairly long resolution, and it includes a couple of state <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3344.076s">recommendations</a>  about state policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3346.437s">And</a>  I want to ensure that other Councilors have had the time to consider those policies and to consider the entire text. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3355.122s">And</a>  that I also mentioned this because I am the first in the alphabet, which means that I have to state what I'm going to do first. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3364.307s">And</a>  that's simply to say to my fellow Councilors that I would definitely respect people's desires to have time and committee <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3373.001s">to</a>  understand the issue more. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3374.723s">And</a>  I will, as a co-sponsor, make sure that this does move through committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3379.968s">But</a>  I just want to state that I'd love to hear from other Councilors in terms of whether sending it to committee is something that you would prefer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3389.215s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3390.016s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3391.737s">It's</a>  my reading of this resolution that it essentially is a recommendation for the city, for the police department on a policy, but it's not creating policy of our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3405.226s">And</a>  so I'd be fine voting with it tonight, especially seeing that the police chief will still be the final arbiter of what the policy is. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3415.213s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3415.993s">We've</a>  talked a lot about the science of it, I'm not going to delve into that too deep, but I would be okay with this going either way tonight, either sending it to committee or to are just voting it out tonight, because it is essentially a. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3431.675s">It's</a>  a rung above symbolic, but it's not us imposing policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3439.341s">I</a>  think it's to the public comment earlier, I just looked up what the definitions of distribution are in these laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3448.208s">They</a>  don't involve what we were afraid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3451.851s">They</a>  don't involve sale or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3454.653s">And</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3457.483s">I</a>  or I guess I guess Yeah, so I would be happy with this going going forward, but I defer to the sponsors on the motion unless there's further comment.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3470.773s">The</a>  motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro to send this to committee public health and community safety committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3481.061s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3481.862s">I</a>  think that's for <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3489.244s">I'm</a>  gonna ask for a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3490.404s">I</a>  just, it's right down the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3493.626s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3493.806s">Clerk,</a>  please call the roll.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3668.075s">and</a>  have continued to attack Israeli civilians, injuring hundreds in rocket attacks since October 7th, and whereas since those horrific attacks, the ongoing Israeli military campaign and blockade has created a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions in Gaza, and whereas since October 7th, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3684.042s">The</a>  Israeli military has killed over 26,000 Palestinians in Gaza, injured over 62,000, and more than 85% of all Gaza residents have been displaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3692.069s">And</a>  whereas the ongoing military campaign has had a horrific toll on civilians in Gaza, with UNICEF describing the Gaza Strip as the, quote, world's most dangerous place to be a child, and reporting that 40% of all deaths in Gaza have been deaths of children, and whereas the Israeli military has launched more than 22,000 airstrikes at Gaza, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3710.586s">resulting</a>  in the destruction of over 70% of all homes and schools, and most of its civilian infrastructure, including electricity, communications, water, sewer, and sanitation systems, with the World Health Organization reporting that all Gazan hospitals have been destroyed or seriously damaged, exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, and <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3729.321s">whereas</a>  the near total siege on Gaza has prevented the delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid, and whereas the World Food Program has reported that all 2.2 million people in Gaza are facing crisis levels of food insecurity, that one in four Gazans is facing catastrophic hunger, and that without an end to bombardment and resumption of humanitarian aid, famine will spread quickly across the population and <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3753.408s">whereas</a>  humanitarian organizations report that the Israeli military kills an average of 250 Palestinians each day, almost all civilians, and that these deaths are a direct result of airstrikes, the blockade of basic food and medical aid, and the destruction of hospitals and basic shelter, which are war crimes, and whereas Hamas continues to hold over 100 Israeli civilians hostage and target Israeli civilians, which are war crimes, and whereas Israel continues to detain thousands of Palestinians who have never been charged with or convicted of a crime, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3782.945s">including</a>  scores of children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3784.926s">And</a>  whereas on October 26, 2023, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for an immediate, durable, and sustained humanitarian truce between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in Gaza, and numerous international humanitarian organizations have similarly called for a sustained ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3802.258s">And</a>  whereas the previous ceasefire from November 24 to November 30, 2023, allowed for the release of some Israeli hostages, some Palestinian detainees, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3811.804s">and</a>  allowed emergency aid and fuel to enter Gaza and whereas the history of Israel and Palestine since 1948 includes systemic displacement of Palestinians and occupation of Palestine, the imposition of illegal blockades upon and denial of basic civil and human rights to Palestinian civilians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3827.68s">ongoing</a>  and escalating terrorism and violent attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, and extremist violence aimed at Israeli civilians, and whereas many members of the Medford community are suffering from trauma, grief, shock, and fear compounded by recent <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3843.439s">increased</a>  incidence of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Palestinian racism, both nationally and locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3850.181s">And</a>  whereas members of the Medford community, including Palestinians and Jews, are speaking out for peace in Israel and Palestine, and in support of a permanent bilateral ceasefire and a return of all hostages, innocent detainees, and political prisoners, now, therefore, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3865.885s">Be</a>  it resolved by the Medford City Council that we support an enduring bilateral ceasefire in Israel and Gaza and the immediate return of all hostages, innocent detainees, and political prisoners. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3877.329s">Be</a>  it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we unequivocally condemn all violence against civilians, including the attacks by Hamas on October 7, 2023 against Israeli civilians, the Israeli military campaign against Gaza that continues to unleash disproportionate violence against Palestinian civilians, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3894.415s">attacks</a>  by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, and all attacks by all parties against civilians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3902.518s">Be</a>  it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we support the lifting of the blockade and the uninhibited provision of life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3911.161s">Be</a>  it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3913.422s">We</a>  affirm the inalienable right of all people to live in peace, free from fear of harm and prejudice, be it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we unequivocally condemn all xenophobic violence, attacks, and rhetoric, and affirm the inalienable right of all people to know safety and acceptance, regardless of their religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, or skin color. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3934.798s">be</a>  it further resolved by the Medford City Council that we urge the Biden administration, the United States Senate, and the United States Congress to exert the full extent of their power, influence, and funding to bring about an enduring ceasefire, the uninhibited provision of humanitarian aid, and the release of all hostages and detained innocents, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3952.318s">Be</a>  it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be sent to each member of Medford's federal delegation, that's Senator Warren, Senator Markey, and Representative Clark, and to President Biden, urging them to use their power and influence to bring about a sustained and enduring ceasefire so as to protect and honor all human life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3971.242s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_65]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3974.002s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3974.863s">Thank</a>  you for reading all of that into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3978.929s">I</a>  want to briefly speak to why I'm putting forth an amended resolution from what was submitted to be incorporated in the Council's formal agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3986.771s">After</a>  I put forward the resolution last week, I was contacted by many constituents who urged me to reconsider the language before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4003.382s">With</a>  an issue such as this, it is critical to speak with as much clarity and precision as possible, even when and especially when it's uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4012.568s">I</a>  was called upon to amend this resolution to more authentically and faithfully represent the harms endured on both sides of the Israel and Palestinian border. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4021.173s">In</a>  addition, while the ultimate ask of this resolution is for an immediate and enduring bilateral ceasefire, I was also called upon to not let the historical context go unsaid and unacknowledged. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4031.539s">I</a>  thank everybody who got in touch with me from the original request to put forward a ceasefire resolution to the many people who gave me feedback and worked with me to improve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4051.323s">Despite</a>  my note about updating the language of this resolution, I also want to put forth a disclaimer that I don't believe I personally have the ability or maybe it's simply not possible to talk about this issue in a way that does not leave one group or another at risk of feeling diminished or blamed or impoverished. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4075.506s">If</a>  you are feeling that way, please blame me or blame the insufficiency of language to talk about an issue that is breaking all of our hearts and has been breaking all of our hearts for decades, and most especially many people in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4086.413s">And</a>  thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4088.559s">I</a>  want to speak briefly to why I elected to bring this resolution forward, apart from the fact that I was contacted by constituents to do so, that being the ultimate reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4100.527s">I</a>  am Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4101.648s">My</a>  ancestors on both sides came to America in the early 1900s because Eastern Europe wasn't safe for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4107.772s">My</a>  last name is Collins because my great-grandfather couldn't get a job with a Jewish last name. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4112.956s">My</a>  family knows that anti-Semitism is real and it is dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4118.976s">I</a>  believe that past hardship and trauma and persecution are never valid nor meaningful, but we can seek to make past trauma and hardship, we can seek to get something out of that if we put that experience in service of other people and stand in solidarity with other people who are also facing oppression and persecution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4141.232s">Now</a>  we see a right-wing government using the grief of Jewish people, like me, and the name of Jewish people to justify the destruction of an entire civilian population in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4150.798s">There</a>  are no words that can adequately capture this horror, pain, and injustice. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4155.141s">This</a>  resolution is long, but the ask is simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4158.023s">Our</a>  US government is deeply entwined with and invested in the Israeli military. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4162.006s">Our</a>  federal leaders have the influence, the power, and the purse strings to hasten an end to the killing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4168.75s">This</a>  issue is painful and divisive, more for some than for others. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4173.974s">But</a>  ultimately, this resolution is about safety, and I believe that should unify us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4179.117s">Marginalizing</a>  Palestinians, whether legally, physically, or in the media, advances no one's safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4185.701s">It's</a>  simply not right, and I would defy anyone to tell me that the mass murder, displacement, and destruction in Gaza will leave Israeli residents more safe from violent extremism. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4197.17s">Some</a>  people would question the validity of city-level resolutions about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4201.295s">To</a>  me, this is a Medford issue because Medford residents are invested in the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4206.262s">And</a>  while the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4207.323s">government</a>  condones the killing and sends unrestricted military aid to Israel, communities right here in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4212.971s">are</a>  starved for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4214.933s">If</a>  you attend any average city council meeting, what you'll hear us talk about ultimately is how there aren't enough public dollars to pay for resident services, fully funded schools, affordable housing, road safety, and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4227.556s">Meanwhile,</a>  our federal leaders authorized billions to help bomb kids in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4233.198s">I</a>  find that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4243.174s">I</a>  find it unfathomable on a human level, and I find it infuriating as a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4248.686s">Those</a>  dollars should be promoting wellness at home, not destruction abroad. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4253.419s">I</a>  hope that we can find unity in the unacceptability of this oppression and this loss of life, and in demanding an immediate and lasting de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4263.565s">I</a>  hope that we as a council can join the groundswell of city councils, amplifying their residents' calls for ceasefire, and add Medford's voice to the chorus for peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4272.99s">I</a>  hope we can find unity in diminishing no one's suffering and trauma, and in demanding safety and peace for all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_62]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4278.894s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4305.728s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4308.25s">Councilor</a>  Callaghan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4310.791s">Because</a>  I work for a 501C3 organization that takes a position on a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza, among other things, I have filed a disclosure form with the city clerk, but I have been advised by the State Ethics Commission that I am able to vote on this issue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4326.301s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4330.904s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4333.385s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4336.374s">I'd</a>  just like to say that many members of this community, people I consider to be very close friends have encouraged me to vote in favor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4345.062s">What</a>  I will say is that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4356.093s">I'm</a>  an officer in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4357.915s">military.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4358.596s">The</a>  Hatch Act does technically allow reservists to comment on these sorts of matters when not on active duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4367.846s">It</a>  is my belief, however, that even though I do commend my colleague for writing a <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4376.909s">very</a>  thorough and very well said resolution that voting on this resolution would adversely impact my ability to do my job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4388.717s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there, and I will be abstaining from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4398.444s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4400.54s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4401.862s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Villescaz and thank you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4405.506s">I</a>  think that I'm going to <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4409.465s">bring</a>  us back to a few sessions ago, and I made a commitment that for one councilor, I would stand with the policy that I will not vote on any national or international vote that comes to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4424.937s">I</a>  think we have so many issues right now within our community that I think our focus really needs to be on the measures of Medford right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4435.946s">I</a>  know that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4439.088s">the</a>  information will go out there that Councilor Scott Peli doesn't believe in this, or Councilor Scott Peli's belief is X or Y. The truth of the matter is, everybody is in favor of peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4450.401s">And</a>  I've had the opportunity to talk to so many <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4453.965s">great</a>  residents of method both from Palestine that are in support of this resolution, that are from that are Jewish that are supporting this resolution, and a Jewish residents that are totally against this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4471.4s">So</a>  I found that this one resolution gave me the opportunity to listen to some amazing people that she had some amazing thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4482.709s">And</a>  what I find it more important is that we have an avenue to bring some very, very educated people that have their own thought process to come together and unite them, and then come back with a message that I will personally work with, that we can contact the people that have contacted me, bring my friends together, and then send a message together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4506.981s">Because</a>  one thing that I've realized and something Medford doesn't need, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4511.189s">This</a>  is another piece dividing our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4513.651s">So</a>  no matter what anybody votes or how they vote tonight, there's going to be a half that's really separated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4521.058s">And</a>  that's not from my opinion, my own opinion, my beliefs, but this is my opinion from the multiple phone calls I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4529.486s">I</a>  did receive messages from people that asked me that if they could, if I could read something into the record or a statement to the record, and I on both sides, I, I recommend a recommended my Palestinian friends to send any messages they wanted me to read on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4547.712s">I've</a>  asked my friends on who feel that this isn't a resolution that they feel safe on that I would share the information show. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4555.735s">So</a>  if, if you would allow me I have</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4559.096s">I</a>  have, if you wouldn't mind, I just have some as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4562.304s">Could</a>  we let councilor speak and then can we come back to the reading into the record piece? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4565.531s">Is</a>  that okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4568.476s">It's</a>  uncharacteristic, Councilor Bears, that usually we... I'd just like to treat all public participation the same, if that's all right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4575.14s">This</a>  is a public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4576.481s">This</a>  is the council speaking as part of the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4581.164s">Are</a>  you reading other people's statements in the record?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4582.845s">I</a>  am. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4582.965s">All</a>  right, I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4583.686s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4583.886s">So</a>  if you'd like to do that, I'll... If that's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4585.767s">I'll</a>  yield to you and then come back.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4587.048s">I</a>  have some from others. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4588.889s">If</a>  I could just go to... Let every councilor say their piece, then I'll go right back to you after councilors have spoken to read other statements into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4595.193s">You'll</a>  be first in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4597.389s">Councilor</a>  say.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4598.23s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4600.052s">Um,</a>  my focus as a city councilor in this job as a candidate who ran for city council who first ran for city council, um, just over two years ago, um, who started the campaign almost three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4614.445s">The</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4616.581s">biggest</a>  issue going up at going in my brain at that time was fighting to make sure that our residents that all of our residents felt safe and not only just safe, but welcome and included and engaged in our city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4631.588s">I</a>  grew up, obviously, my <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4635.749s">My</a>  skin color makes me look different from other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4637.77s">I</a>  grew up oftentimes as someone who felt excluded, as someone who didn't necessarily feel completely represented in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4648.776s">And</a>  for me, that was a driving factor to get involved in government and to make sure that we built a local government that reflected the desires of its people, that the <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4658.2s">push</a>  for equity and for justice, and to make sure that that push was reflected in our actions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4666.123s">And</a>  at the end of the day, to make sure that all of our residents feel safe and welcome here in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4673.125s">It's</a>  with that spirit that after the horrifying attacks on October 7th, I reached out to Jewish, Arab, and Muslim community leaders to make sure that, at least from my office, that they <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4687.029s">felt</a>  safe, that they felt welcomed and included, and knowing that there were growing incidents of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic and xenophobic attacks and incidents in this community to make sure that they have the resources they need and needed and still need to feel safe and welcome in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4707.968s">Um,</a>  as situations on the ground, um, have developed, uh, more residents of various backgrounds, including a large number of, uh, Jewish, personally very close Jewish friends begged me as a city councilor to vote yes, um, when a ceasefire resolution, if a ceasefire resolution came across my desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4728.535s">And</a>  through those discussions, I realized that not voting, not doing anything is, um, an action in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4738.28s">And</a>  so, and for so many of our residents, they need to see that their elected officials align with the values that we espouse as candidates and that we espouse as politicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4761.295s">When</a>  I look at this resolution, I look at the first and last lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4766.877s">recognizing</a>  and celebrating the sanctity, the preciousness, the equality of human life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4774.325s">Looking</a>  at the last line cites the core purpose of this resolution as to reaffirm that we stand with protecting and honoring all human life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4787.588s">This</a>  is undoubtedly a difficult situation, but I really do commend Councilor Collins for keeping the focus in this resolution on the sanctity of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4799.56s">for</a>  keeping the focus of this resolution through hope on equality, bringing in stakeholders from many, many different parts of this community, hearing opposition to different drafts of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4812.165s">I</a>  know the vice president has worked really, really hard on a product that best captures that inclusive energy and spirit that we want to see in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4823.28s">For</a>  me, again, the local aspect of this is that, is just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4828.925s">It</a>  is the quality of letting our residents know that we stand with these values. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4835.842s">when</a>  I also think about why this resolution is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4841.187s">I</a>  realize that, you know, while this isn't necessarily, you know, obviously, I don't think anyone is under the illusion that we ourselves as Medford City Council is going to stop war in the Middle East, but <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4854.358s">I</a>  do think that many, many folks, many residents, neighbors, activists have felt disillusioned, disheartened, and in despair after various and numerous attempts to reach out to federal and state level stakeholders on this issue, people with influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4871.474s">And</a>  they're coming to the Medford City Council, they're coming to City Hall tonight, because they recognize that there aren't many avenues left. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4880.475s">We</a>  are, in many ways, one of the last stops that people are going to, to ask us, to beg us to help them get their message across to our federal electeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4894.848s">I</a>  think we really need to try, in any case, be it Gaza, be it a local issue about a park or a street or a sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4904.354s">We</a>  as elected officials, as the Medford City Council, have a responsibility to amplify the community's desires to speak to federal elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4913.6s">That's</a>  our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4914.621s">We</a>  do it on different issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4916.322s">We</a>  reach out to Congress people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4917.703s">We</a>  reach out to state reps to help us resolve things. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4921.626s">This</a>  is our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4924.907s">I,</a>  you know, I think there's a crisis of faith in democracy when people don't feel hurt by their elected officials, and I think we need to work to restore that faith in our country.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4937.23s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4946.332s">Any</a>  further comments by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4951.724s">Seeing</a>  none, as the president and the chair, I will not be, I will be voting, but I will not be participating in debate as I move us through this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4958.969s">And</a>  I hope everyone can appreciate that that is my role. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4962.612s">Now</a>  we will go to hear from, if anyone would like to read anything into the record, I know we have Councilor Scarpelli has a number of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4968.976s">I</a>  have an item. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4969.557s">Are</a>  there any other councilors would like to read any statements into the record that they received? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4974.639s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, and I appreciate your deference to me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4977.341s">No,</a>  I completely understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4979.222s">This</a>  is a topic that I respect from all my fellow councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4983.325s">I</a>  think that anything that you've said, I don't think any of us disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4988.468s">I</a>  think it's very important that everybody understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4990.209s">We</a>  have a council that is very cordial and respectful, and this isn't an easy and a simple issue that has a simple outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4999.676s">But</a>  I will tell you, as Councilor Sagan mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5004.939s">the</a>  communication I received from our constituents that felt the need that were scared to come out tonight, that really wanted to understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5018.123s">what</a>  is being said so far, they're feeling the opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5021.804s">They</a>  feel that with this motion moving forward, that it hurts what we have in our community of bringing people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5031.787s">So</a>  again, not my view, I'm explaining what residents have reached out to me and asked that I share. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5040.569s">One</a>  person that I respect, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5043.69s">A</a>  former teacher of mine, who has been living in Israel for many, many years now, reached out with a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5051.753s">He</a>  said, while nobody here wants to see any more death, people must remember that on October 6, there was a ceasefire agreement in effect that was holding well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5061.355s">However,</a>  on October 7, Hamas terrorists violated the ceasefire and attacked <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5066.417s">kibbutzim,</a>  villages, and a music festival murdering 1,200 Israeli, including not only Jews, but Muslims, Christians, Jews, Americans, Thais, Russians, British, among others. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5079.049s">While</a>  mutilating many bodies, burning some alive in ovens, and raping countless women, there were people ranging in ages eight to 87 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5089.667s">There</a>  was among over 230 kidnapped people that were brought back to Gaza, of which 136 are still being held. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5096.532s">If</a>  they are alive, we still have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5099.074s">Since</a>  Hamas has not allowed the IRC to visit the hostages, we have no idea how any of them are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5106.099s">A</a>  ceasefire resolution only gives confidence to Hamas that they are winning the war in the West and makes it harder to get the hostages, the bodies, back. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5114.986s">Plus,</a>  Israel will not accept a ceasefire unless includes a return of all hostages and bodies as well as leadership of Hamas being sent into exile to a country that will accept them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5126.871s">Unless</a>  those conditions happen, it doesn't matter how many cities or states or countries vote for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5132.493s">Israel</a>  will not accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5133.653s">So</a>  I think that whether you believe in it or not, these are messages that come from families of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5140.876s">We</a>  have another that was sent <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5143.257s">that</a>  wanted to reach out in the statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5146.418s">Forgive</a>  me that they're longer, but to members of the council and those in attendance, thank you for listening to this statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5153.1s">The</a>  months since 10-7 have been extremely tight trying for the Jewish community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5158.981s">We</a>  experienced a predominantly attack on the brothers and sisters solely because they are Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5165.413s">It</a>  brings back haunting memories of when this was commonplace not more than a century ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5171.538s">We</a>  are slaughtered not for the military advantage, not for political maneuvering, but because we're Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5176.922s">The</a>  only thing different today is that there is a country and an army that will push back and defend us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5182.247s">In</a>  the World War Two during the programs in Russia, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5185.089s">and</a>  the inquisitions across Liberia and in ups or uprisings like Farhoud in Middle East, we were defenseless. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5194.915s">But</a>  today in the first time in 2000 years, we have the ability to stand up and push back against the Jew haters that are attempting to alienate us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5203.641s">In</a>  the latest, we have experienced rapidly rising anti-Semitism, including here at home, with genocide chants down the street at Harvard, and anti-Zionists who, by definition, call the destruction of the Jewish homeland in Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5219.673s">We</a>  hear louder and louder every day the warning signals that Jews are no longer safe, coupled with the thousands upon thousands who celebrated our deaths on 10-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5228.26s">We</a>  are scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5230.862s">We</a>  cannot trust our local officials to stand against anti-Semitism, and we cannot trust our fellow citizens when we see them marching in the streets calling for more Jewish deaths. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5241.109s">Our</a>  concerns are not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5242.67s">Our</a>  safety is ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5244.711s">And</a>  this ceasefire resolution before you is a symbol that you are telling Jews to once again not push back, not fight for the survival, but lay down and take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5253.517s">That</a>  is what we hear when there are calls for Israel to call off the war against those who started this in the Battle of 10-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5261.442s">During</a>  World War II, we did not have a ceasefire for Nazis or Imperial Japan, despite the horrific amount of civilian death in the war and aggression the Axis started. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5270.865s">There</a>  was no ceasefire against Al Qaeda 9-11, and the worldwide Jewish community will not abide the ceasefire with the Hamas. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5277.988s">The</a>  common thread here is that there cannot be a ceasefire <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5281.229s">with</a>  groups whose entire reason for existence is ideological mass murder. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5286.73s">The</a>  only type of viable, long-term, and durable ceasefire is one where Hamas' war-making ability is destroyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5294.612s">Only</a>  then can Israeli lives and security of the Palestinians can be free from an Islamic dictatorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5301.393s">A</a>  ceasefire that leaves Hamas in place is a banned <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5305.194s">band-aid</a>  upon a cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5307.195s">It</a>  may save some lives in the short term, but guarantees more war, death, and destruction down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5313.616s">Hamas</a>  officials have promised to repeat the genocide of 10-7 again and again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5320.498s">Israel</a>  will be forced to continue to defend their citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5323.419s">Hamas</a>  will continue to try to kill Jews and hide behind their own Gaza subjects. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5329.101s">Jews,</a>  Arabs, Israelis, Palestinians, all will suffer until Hamas is no longer <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5334.542s">poses</a>  a threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5335.703s">And</a>  even after this, there is those who are still not swayed by the existential fear of Jewish constituents face. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5345.351s">I</a>  leave you with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5346.472s">Why</a>  is the council taking such a stand? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5349.134s">What</a>  is it about <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5350.495s">this</a>  war that is exceptionally different from all the other conflicts raging in the world, that makes it worth splitting a community further alienated, an already fearful minority, just to issue a statement about a handful of these beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5365.859s">How</a>  does this serve the interests of Medford residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5368.581s">And</a>  what message do you think will be heard for your actions today? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5373.384s">Thank</a>  you for listening to these concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5377.887s">So</a>  I will tell you, I've shared some amazing conversations from my Palestinian friends that it was a great understanding, something that I will never understand the, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5393.797s">the</a>  feelings that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5395.158s">I</a>  could never, no one here, unless you're Palestinian or Jewish in Israel and understand the situation we're going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5402.546s">So</a>  to minimize that, to minimize that, to minimize that would be disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5407.37s">But</a>  I will tell you that there is <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5416.599s">a</a>  ground movement moving forward that I will gladly move forward with, with my friends that I've now worked with, that bringing our Palestinian people and our Jewish residents to find a clear message that we can work together, that could present to this community, that it's more of a unified front. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5437.437s">And</a>  I think that that's what's important here in Medford today. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5441.661s">So</a>  again, whether it's popular or not, that's not my intent here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5448.227s">I</a>  have a strong belief in what I believe in when it comes to issues dealing with national, international issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5459.496s">I'm</a>  gonna abstain from any votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5461.478s">I</a>  will not vote for anything on any agenda that comes forth in this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5465.722s">I've</a>  done this in the past, and I'll do this moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5469.4s">That</a>  doesn't mean George Scarpelli doesn't believe in peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5472.923s">That</a>  doesn't mean that George Scarpelli doesn't believe that there isn't a way to unify our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5481.489s">But</a>  this is who I am, who my residents have requested their information be spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5491.017s">And</a>  I thank you for the time, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5495.04s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5496.321s">I'm</a>  going to read a statement that we received a call here at City Hall from a resident who has to make a statement in support of <a href="../resolutions/24-035.pdf"><font color="green">24-035</font></a> resolution in support of a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5508.009s">The</a>  caller is a Medford resident of over 15 years, married to an Arab American and mother of two children are also of Arab heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5515.034s">She</a>  supports the resolution filed by Vice President Collins for a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5519.737s">She</a>  has friends directly impacted who have lost dozens and dozens of family members <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5523.8s">a</a>  ceasefire is what's best for all people and would prevent wider escalation of wars and suffering in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5529.044s">The</a>  caller asked to remain anonymous for the safety of her family. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5534.229s">So</a>  we've heard a number of opinions tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5537.571s">We</a>  are going to hear opinions that we disagree with tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5540.994s">Votes</a>  are going to be taken that we may disagree with tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5544.037s">I</a>  deeply ask everyone to respect <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5547.452s">the</a>  rules of the council, my role as chair, and we're gonna try to hear from everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5552.218s">We're</a>  gonna go, there's no end point. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5553.86s">I've</a>  been here till 2.30 in the morning before. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5556.443s">Maybe</a>  we'll be here tonight if everyone in this room wants to speak for two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5560.408s">But</a>  when we speak, we're going to listen for two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5564.253s">I'm</a>  going to give a 30 second warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5566.877s">And</a>  I really please ask folks not to interrupt or try to disrupt the speech of anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5572.423s">Again,</a>  we are going to hear things that we disagree with tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5575.305s">I</a>  stand here very often and hear things I disagree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5578.188s">And</a>  I do try my very, very best not to react. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5582.352s">And</a>  I ask just that we hold that level of respect for everyone as they speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5587.622s">We'll</a>  hear from everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5588.683s">A</a>  vote on some motion will be taken on this resolution, and that will be how this process goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5595.247s">So</a>  as I said, we can have folks line up here at the podium if they would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5600.791s">We</a>  will alternate also with Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5602.812s">If</a>  people are on Zoom, please raise your hand on Zoom, and we will go back and forth between the podium and Zoom as hands are raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5611.278s">Everyone</a>  will have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5613.159s">I</a>  will begin a timer after I ask folks to introduce themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5617.862s">If</a>  you would like to just provide the city that you live in versus your street address, you may do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5624.648s">But</a>  I will ask for name and city of residence and address if you are comfortable sharing your address. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5630.593s">It</a>  looks like we're gonna have a lot of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5632.114s">So</a>  again, as I did before, and as you all saw the role of this chair, I'm going to ask you to stop at two minutes and I really please ask that you respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5643.204s">We</a>  cool with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5645.663s">All</a>  right, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5647.144s">And</a>  we're gonna start at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5649.526s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5650.968s">We'll</a>  make sure we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5652.389s">And</a>  you will have two minutes once you've said your name.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5656.152s">Muneer</a>  Germanis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5657.914s">I</a>  live at 3 Summit Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5660.416s">Thank</a>  you, Muneer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5661.457s">I</a>  was born in Jerusalem, Palestine, prior to the creation of the State of Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5667.341s">and</a>  I'm a survivor of the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948, which has been ongoing for the past 75 years and has drastically increased in the past few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5680.168s">Apparently,</a>  when my ancestors became Christians, we lost our rights to our house and land according to Israeli law. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5690.074s">By</a>  training, I'm a physicist with a PhD in physics from Tufts University, and I'm a naturalized citizen that has called Medford home for the past 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5699.846s">I</a>  was ordained as an elder at the Presbyterian Church, Clarendon Hill in Somerville, and I served on its ruling session for approximately 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5710.598s">I</a>  was also a member of the Medford Human Rights Commission and served as chair for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5716.883s">I</a>  am currently a member of Mass Peace Action, Jewish Voice for Peace, as well as Safe Medford and Medford People Power. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5724.168s">I'm</a>  here tonight to urge each and every member of this council to support this resolution <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5731.633s">which</a>  is aimed at ending the nightmare in Gaza and Israel with a huge number of bombs, missiles, and drone attacks that our government is funding from our tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5743.962s">This</a>  is a human rights issue that concerns all of us in this room, in this city, and in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5750.226s">Two</a>  months ago, I contacted our human rights commission to discuss issuing a statement about this conflict and its effect on our community, similar to what other human rights commissions in neighboring cities have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5762.292s">But</a>  the commission was not allowed to even discuss this without permission from the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5767.975s">I'm</a>  grateful that this Council is not restricted in this manner and thankful for the opportunity to discuss this in a public forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5774.927s">Thanks</a>  again for allowing me to speak tonight and once more I urge and implore you to vote for this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5780.496s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5792.97s">We</a>  have some hands raised on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5794.871s">I'm</a>  going to go to Steve Schnapp. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5797.171s">Steve,</a>  I'm going to unmute you, ask you for your name, and you can provide your address or your city, and then I will give you a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5807.434s">My</a>  name is Steve Schnapp. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5808.735s">I</a>  live at 36 Hillside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5810.996s">in</a>  Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5813.276s">I</a>  want to address the relevance of this resolution to me as a Medford resident and the concern that Councilor Scarpelli and others have raised about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5823.228s">I</a>  was born in February 1946, just after World War II ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5828.569s">I</a>  had two uncles in the military, one of whom fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and he was in the advanced forces that liberated several concentration camps. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5838.271s">He</a>  was featured in Steven Spielberg's documentary of the Holocaust. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5843.872s">The</a>  Holocaust was very present in my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5847.132s">My</a>  mother gave me the Hebrew name Shalom, which means peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5852.409s">And</a>  she did that because she wanted to recognize that this atrocity should never happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5864.615s">I'd</a>  like to read a quote that addresses the relevance of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5871.44s">Every</a>  gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5887.182s">The</a>  world in arms is not spending money alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5890.905s">It</a>  is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children, and the hopes of its children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5901.073s">The</a>  cost of one modern heavy bomber is this, a modern school in more than 30 cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5909.88s">It's</a>  two electric power plants, each serving towns of 60,000 population. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5917.509s">It</a>  is to find fully equipped hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5920.75s">It</a>  is some 50 miles of concrete pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5923.97s">We</a>  pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5929.051s">We</a>  pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5935.172s">Steve,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5937.033s">That</a>  was Dwight David Eisenhower. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5940.493s">Thank</a>  you, Steve.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_64]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5954.635s">I</a>  have been a resident of Medford for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5958.098s">My</a>  children went to Medford public schools and graduated from high school there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5962.921s">I</a>  was born in Lebanon and came to Tufts University as a graduate student. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5968.024s">I</a>  have been a U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5968.805s">citizen</a>  for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5971.204s">In</a>  1982, I planned to visit my parents with my infant, but was urged not to travel because within four days of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the Israeli army had occupied my village, a Christian village halfway into Lebanon, near Beirut, surrounded by Muslim and Druze villages, where we lived in harmony with our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5992.448s">The</a>  Israelis came to divide and conquer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=5995.649s">Daily,</a>  they would bomb the neighboring villages and would tell people in my village to hide, expecting retaliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6003.156s">My</a>  brothers fled with their families, and we were scattered in different parts of the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6008.901s">My</a>  uncle stayed with my parents to take care of them, but he died during one of the Israeli bombings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6015.427s">My</a>  parents had to leave home, taking very little with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6019.37s">Every</a>  home in our village was destroyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6021.19s">Our</a>  home was hit by 18 rockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6024.471s">My</a>  mother died, never saw her home again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6027.392s">My</a>  mother-in-law died alone in a nursing home, having been displaced twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6032.913s">Once</a>  in 1948 from her home in Jerusalem, Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6037.214s">And</a>  then, they were brutally forced by the Israelis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6041.815s">My</a>  children... 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6044.136s">My</a>  children grew up yearning for family presence in their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6048.219s">Israel</a>  destroyed entire neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, and shelters in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6054.204s">What</a>  happened to us cannot be compared to this horrific assault on Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6060.589s">My</a>  son-in-law's family was seeking shelter in the church in Gaza City.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_63]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6132.116s">My</a>  name is Suhad Zinda. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6133.617s">I</a>  live on 5 Essex, Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6135.939s">I've</a>  been a resident of Medford for almost 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6139.362s">My</a>  family lives in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6141.464s">I</a>  came to Medford from Gaza City. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6146.288s">I</a>  came here as an undergrad, I came here as a student, and now I'm an educator on Tufts Medford campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6155.862s">I</a>  chose Medford to raise my family because of its diverse community and because that's where I felt safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6164.405s">It</a>  was my first time living in a city, experiencing a city without cement walls, without barbed wires or checkpoints. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6175.856s">I</a>  saw trophies here after the Israeli government tightened its siege on Gaza in 2001, which revoked my movement permit to return to Gaza and be with my family ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6191.423s">I</a>  was living only an hour and 40 minutes away as an undergrad at Birzeit University in the West Bank when they did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6200.588s">It</a>  took me four full years in order to bring my family to the United States and reunite with them on a different continent. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6208.673s">It</a>  was easier than seeing them and being with my family who live an hour and 40 minutes away from me, only because they were in Gaza, only because of our ethnicity.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6219.959s">You</a>  have 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_53]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6689.921s">I</a>  am an American Jew and no stranger to Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6693.607s">I</a>  have relatives there and at one point lived there for the better part of a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6699.386s">I'm</a>  here tonight to urge the Medford City Council to speak out against this brutal conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6706.192s">Because</a>  I am Jewish, Israel's actions are being done in my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6711.796s">Because</a>  I am American, the conflict is being fueled with my tax money. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6717.781s">Therefore,</a>  I have not just the right, but the obligation to call for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6724.494s">I</a>  have demonstrated written emails made countless phone calls to our representatives in DC. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6732.138s">I've</a>  joined with other Jewish members of the fifth congressional district to press Catherine Clark, the Democratic whip in the House of Representatives to call for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6744.531s">But</a>  my most direct line to political power is through you all, my city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6751.196s">And</a>  yes, it makes a difference where you stand on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6756.72s">Your</a>  voice as a city council is louder than our individual voices can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6763.084s">Please</a>  use your voice to add Medford to the growing number of cities and towns nationwide that are calling for ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6770.816s">You'd</a>  be taking sides, not with Israel, not with Hamas, but with the children and innocent men and women who continue to be the victims of brutality, day after day, week after week, month after month. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6786.37s">Don't</a>  wait another minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6788.291s">You</a>  can do this tonight, right here, right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6791.714s">Please,</a>  take a stand for peace, take a stand for life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6796.879s">Ceasefire</a>  now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6805.011s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6805.412s">We</a>  have a hand on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6807.456s">I'm</a>  going to go to Kate on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6809.38s">Kate,</a>  please provide your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6811.665s">I</a>  will give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_56]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6818.732s">Hello,</a>  my name is Kate Ryan and I am on Warren Street in Medford and I am not at the city council meeting because as an autistic person, the environment is too hellish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6832.342s">And</a>  I am thinking about my brethren in Palestine right now who are suffering so much more. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6841.329s">This</a>  is a mass disabling event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6844.452s">We</a>  should not be supporting <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6847.97s">this</a>  we need peace we need it now and I would like you to all think about the fact that in the past two hours we have been at this city council meeting approximately 10 children in Gaza have been killed and that is all</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6874.889s">to</a>  go to the podium, name and address for the record, and I'll give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6908.587s">Jennifer,</a>  I'm sorry, could you press the button on the microphone? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6912.408s">You</a>  may have tapped it off.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_49]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6914.869s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6915.849s">I</a>  don't need to start over, do I?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6917.069s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6918.21s">Well,</a>  we heard you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6918.85s">We'll</a>  get it for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_49]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6921.751s">And</a>  we're furious that our tax dollars are being used for this morally reprehensible purpose, especially when there's so much need here at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6931.914s">It's</a>  heartbreaking to see fellow human beings subjected to so much suffering on a daily and hourly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6939.235s">Tens</a>  of thousands have been killed and injured, children orphaned, the land destroyed, leaving a scorched earth where starvation and disease are now rampant. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6949.937s">Is</a>  this what we want to do with our tax dollars? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6954.318s">Today</a>  we're saying no, not on our watch, not in our name, not with our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6961.252s">If</a>  our leaders at the federal level don't have the backbone to act, let the cities and towns of our country be the moral voice of the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6969.339s">Neighboring</a>  cities of Cambridge and Somerville have already taken a stand, and I urge you, let us join them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6976.141s">The</a>  United States has the power to stop this carnage today, simply by cutting off funds and demanding an immediate ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6983.803s">Please,</a>  please be our voice and speak out for an immediate end to this gross misuse of our public resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6993.044s">Ceasefire</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6994.425s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=6995.205s">We're</a>  going to go back to Zoom.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7002.861s">Grace</a>  Parker on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7005.384s">Grace,</a>  I'll unmute you, ask for your name and address, and I'll give you a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning on a two-minute time limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7016.096s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_45]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7017.179s">Hi,</a>  again, Grace Parker, Bell Lab, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7020.3s">I'll</a>  try to be quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7021.16s">I</a>  just wanted to say that I definitely agree with supporting this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7026.842s">The</a>  atrocities in Gaza are, I mean, so many people have already spoken to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7032.064s">And</a>  I want to say thank you to the people that spoke about their personal experiences and also that I'm just so sorry that you are in this position and that so many people have failed you and failed our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7046.738s">That's</a>  really the crux of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7047.918s">I</a>  don't wanna take up too much time just that I support this and I think you should all vote yes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7051.24s">Thank</a>  you, Grace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7054.561s">Go</a>  to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7059.723s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7061.343s">And</a>  I'll give you a 30-second warning and 10-second warning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7064.005s">Hi,</a>  my name is Beth Basciatelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7065.746s">I'm</a>  a Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7067.867s">And</a>  I would like to present a legal and moral argument for the council's consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7073.93s">I'm</a>  a scholar of global governance and human security. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7078.673s">Under</a>  international law, Israel is an occupying force. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7082.575s">It's</a>  an occupying force. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7084.836s">It</a>  is bound by the principle of protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7088.058s">Under</a>  the Geneva Convention, its duty is to protect the population of Gaza, including civilians and civilian infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7095.524s">It</a>  is also bound by the principles of precaution, distinction, proportionality, and necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7101.769s">According</a>  to any of these principles of international law, Israel is guilty of a whole series of war crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7109.286s">Also</a>  based on international law, the United States is guilty of the crime of legal complicity, which is listed in the Geneva Convention. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7117.729s">Complicity</a>  under the Genocide Convention is a crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7121.43s">It</a>  is legal complicity because it involves active support of a UN member state that is committing war crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7128.173s">The</a>  United States is providing economic, military, intelligence, and diplomatic support to block a ceasefire in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7135.987s">The</a>  genocide that is happening in Gaza could not happen without the support of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7142.209s">Apart</a>  from the sheer loss of life and property, Israel's continued impunity in committing acts of genocide and the United States' ongoing acts of complicity put multilateralism and the entire international law establishment at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7158.513s">These</a>  acts have created a dangerous precedent whereby any authoritarian leader with ethno-nationalist ideologies who comes to power in any country, including the United States, can make a case for committing gross violations of international law. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7177.682s">I</a>  recently attended a webinar with Craig Mobaker, who publicly resigned as director of the New York office of the high commissioner for human rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7185.249s">And</a>  he said, do not doubt this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7187.752s">If</a>  you don't care about Palestine, you are next. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7191.055s">International</a>  human rights is the only thing that stands between powerful actors and those of us who care about living, moving and speaking freely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7199.243s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7207.02s">very,</a>  very soon.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7208.521s">We</a>  have Marianne Vidal on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7211.143s">Marianne,</a>  I'm going to unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7213.024s">Please</a>  provide your name and address or the city you live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7215.546s">And</a>  I will give you a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7219.948s">You</a>  have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_39]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7220.969s">Hi</a>  there, I apologize my light isn't working in my room. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7229.614s">Lifelong</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7231.385s">uh</a>  person i'm medfed i live on central ave i am here today demanding a ceasefire <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7239.027s">I</a>  refuse to take part in something where we're going to call people collateral damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7243.069s">What</a>  we're seeing is not propaganda from Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7247.271s">We</a>  are seeing murder. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7248.892s">We</a>  are seeing genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7250.113s">We</a>  are seeing children crying. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7251.674s">We</a>  are seeing mothers and fathers losing their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7254.695s">We</a>  are seeing the wipe out of a whole demographic of people and I can't sit by and just swipe up on a social media app for distraction anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7265.701s">Ceasefire</a>  now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7269.872s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7273.854s">I'm</a>  going to go to the podium, name and address for the record, and you will have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7277.195s">I'll</a>  give a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7279.436s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7279.836s">Elie</a>  Strassfeld, West Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7282.938s">I</a>  came here to commend the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7284.979s">I</a>  intended to commend the city council on this resolution and to speak out in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7289.581s">I</a>  believe Israel has a right to exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7293.142s">I</a>  believe Israelis should not have to exist in the threat of Hamas, and because of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7299.474s">I</a>  do not believe that an immediate ceasefire is justified, notwithstanding the heartbreaking stories, and I truly mean the heartbreaking stories I hear from my Medford neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7311.644s">However,</a>  I absolutely do not believe that Israel has clean hands here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7316.408s">And</a>  I absolutely believe, as the resolution stated, that an enduring ceasefire is critical and a movement back to a two-state solution is critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7326.175s">So</a>  I was thrilled to see that that's what the resolution said. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7331.522s">I</a>  have to say I am appalled that I come here and the resolution now is so dramatically different in tone than what was originally posted on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7342.628s">I</a>  implore the city council to please move back to the previous resolution that was posted publicly and that people had an opportunity to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7353.114s">It</a>  stands for something this entire city can get behind, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7357.717s">And</a>  that is that we all need to work toward an enduring peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7363.22s">We</a>  don't need to have disputes about definition, about history, the historical context that Councilperson Collins shared was good context, but completely incomplete. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7376.609s">And</a>  I'd ask that that part be stricken and that this council reverts to the version of this resolution that was previously before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7385.694s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7397.679s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7398.32s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7399.421s">Sorry,</a>  Susan, we can't have a flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7402.022s">There's</a>  a message on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7403.964s">We</a>  don't have flags or signs in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7406.306s">Pardon?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7407.446s">There's</a>  a message on your, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7411.369s">If</a>  you could hand it to Eileen for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7412.53s">But</a>  I am going to go to Zoom first. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7414.131s">We</a>  have Amina Awad on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7418.374s">I</a>  mean, I'm going to unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7419.514s">You</a>  can say your name, address and city or city, and give you a 30 second warning and a 10 second warning on a two minute timer for is yours.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7429.998s">Hi,</a>  my name is I mean I'm in speaking in favor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7433.58s">I'm</a>  a resident of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7437.817s">And</a>  as someone who grew up in the Middle East, the lack of action in this country is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7445.338s">I</a>  would be surprised at the shocking anti-Arab racism in this country had I not seen the legacy of racism and imperialism that remains. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7454.78s">Why</a>  are Palestinians always the last in politicians' speeches, including this council, who always mention Palestinians last, even though they're the ones that are victims of genocide? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7466.055s">Palestinians</a>  who are dying deserve to be recognized and heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7470.621s">My</a>  grandfather was forcibly displaced from Jerusalem by Zionist militia in 1948. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7475.748s">This</a>  did not start on October 7th or with Hamas. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7480.765s">The</a>  blockades on Gaza have existed for over a decade, and Israel has been killing Palestinians and stealing their land, conducting occupation and suppression for a long time, which is not a ceasefire, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7495.035s">Gaza</a>  was living under military occupation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7498.057s">And</a>  now, as I'm witnessing millions of Palestinians go through <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7502.08s">a</a>  second Nakba, which is a part of Israel's genocidal, colonial, and white supremacist regime. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7508.304s">This</a>  resolution must pass for our collective liberation and for the Palestinians in Medford, Somerville, and beyond to feel safe and supported by this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7517.509s">My</a>  grandfather, who was born in Jerusalem, died two hours away from Jerusalem in Man Jordan, never being able to return to his home, which is now occupied by settlers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7528.352s">So</a>  despite my family growing up for generations two hours outside the border of Jerusalem, not one of us has been able to step back into the city of our ancestors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7539.476s">And</a>  I also wanted to share a quote from a friend in Gaza who talks about <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7546.269s">One</a>  of his daily tasks in the North is burying the dead and decomposed bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7551.136s">Israeli</a>  forces have killed hundreds in the most horrific ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7555.162s">Almost</a>  daily we find dead bodies that we need to decide where to bury. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7560.39s">Never</a>  did I think that my life at 21 <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7564.195s">would</a>  be burying others. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7566.916s">In</a>  order to move forward, I have to convince myself that I do not know the bodies that I am burying, when they in fact could be my neighbors, my friends, or even family members that have been missing under the rubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7579.38s">I</a>  implore you to think as a human being and to stand with justice and what is right and call for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7588.444s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7599.413s">Please</a>  go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7602.234s">And</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_52]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7603.114s">My</a>  name is Susan Girard. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7604.795s">I've</a>  been living in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7606.356s">I</a>  live on Farragut Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7607.556s">I've</a>  been living in Medford for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7610.837s">I'm</a>  Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7611.437s">I'm</a>  a mother and a grandmother. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7613.278s">And</a>  my message is really simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7616.279s">As</a>  people have stated, out of the 27,000 and growing children that have been killed under these bombs that our tax dollars are supporting, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7627.863s">out</a>  of the 27,000 people, over half of them are children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7632.164s">I</a>  cannot believe, for anyone who believes that the safety of Israel is important, I cannot believe that you are safe when you kill other people's children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7643.627s">And</a>  that's my statement, thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7653.709s">Seeing</a>  no more hands on Zoom, we're gonna stick with the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7656.991s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7658.432s">You</a>  have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7659.092s">I'll</a>  give you a 30-second warning and a 10-second warning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7661.814s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7662.634s">Hi,</a>  I'm Rebecca Butorsky. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7664.175s">I</a>  live on Diane Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7667.377s">I'll</a>  very briefly introduce myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7669.178s">I'm</a>  a scientist, I'm a mom, I'm a Jew, and I'm a descendant of Holocaust survivors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7674.741s">I'm</a>  compelled to speak in favor of the ceasefire resolution brought by Councilor Collins for both political and also personal reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7682.105s">First</a>  of all, I join Palestinians and Israelis who are mourning the senseless loss of life and I condemn violence against civilians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7688.99s">I'm</a>  urging you to pass this resolution tonight because of the role that the US plays in this current war between Israel and Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7696.376s">Israel</a>  is the largest recipient of US foreign aid since World War Two and the US is its major supplier of weapons. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7703.601s">The</a>  U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7703.961s">therefore</a>  has a huge leverage to deescalate this current crisis, and if it doesn't, this catastrophe may escalate into a greater war in the region and causing more civilian deaths. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7717.011s">We</a>  must urge our representatives to join the growing calls for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7721.574s">Second,</a>  I'm compelled to speak personally on behalf of my grandmother, whose entire family was killed in the Holocaust, except for her and her sister, who were able to escape. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7730.037s">She</a>  witnessed genocide and she lived to teach her children and grandchildren to speak up and work towards a world where this will never happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7738.62s">When</a>  I read that entire families in Gaza are being killed and that others are being displaced for the second and third time from their homes, I know that my grandmother would not want this done in her name, and I would not want this done in mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7750.264s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7752.595s">you.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7760.336s">Thank</a>  you, name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7761.797s">You</a>  have two minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_51]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7762.557s">Clare</a>  Sheridan, 190 High Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7766.28s">I</a>  support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7767.921s">Although</a>  not Jewish myself, I was an ardent supporter of the state of Israel until about 20 years ago when I began questioning Israel's treatment of its Palestinian neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7781.43s">So</a>  I traveled to Israel-Palestine twice over the last 15 years to educate myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7789.295s">I</a>  had two personal experiences that I want to convey because they are emblematic of what I found. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7797.469s">On</a>  one trip, I was with a group of American tourists in Hebron in the West Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7803.598s">We</a>  were watching a group of little children exiting their school. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7807.541s">The</a>  street was lined with Israeli soldiers with machine guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7812.325s">One</a>  said to me loudly in English, why are you watching that vermin? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7818.711s">I</a>  almost reminded him that that was what the Nazis called his forebears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7825.497s">But</a>  I held my tongue, he had a gun after all. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7829.781s">On</a>  another trip, I was at the airport heading home. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7833.748s">I</a>  was pulled aside and interrogated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7836.633s">My</a>  bags were searched separately and my passport withheld. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7841.801s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7842.161s">I</a>  had a stamp in my passport from a previous trip to Bosnia to visit an American friend's relatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7851.064s">The</a>  security guy asked me, so, do you love Muslims? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7856.545s">He</a>  wanted to know the names of the people I visited in Bosnia and the names of my friend in the US. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7863.527s">I</a>  responded sweetly that my Bosnian friend's husband was Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7870.609s">The</a>  official became very angry and shouted something I won't repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7876.393s">I</a>  responded, only in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7880.676s">He</a>  let me catch my plane.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7882.737s">You</a>  have 10 seconds, Claire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7883.718s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7884.398s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7894.565s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, we'll go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7896.286s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7897.747s">Two</a>  minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7898.971s">Hi,</a>  my name is Anna Meyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7900.432s">I</a>  live at 6 Douglas Road in Medford, and I'm a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7906.756s">I'm</a>  here tonight to urge you to vote for the ceasefire resolutions with the amendments proposed by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7912.56s">I</a>  believe that passing this resolution will have two incredibly important impacts on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7917.663s">First,</a>  passing this resolution is an affirmation that Medford is a community that values all of its residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7924.187s">Ruth</a>  Wilson Gilmore tells us that where life is precious, life is precious. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7928.669s">What</a>  she means by that is that when we intentionally create communities that affirm the life of every person is meaningful, all people have the capacity to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7938.134s">The</a>  death count in Gaza has surpassed 27,000 individuals that we can count. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7943.117s">At</a>  least 10,000 of those deaths are children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7945.818s">Thousands</a>  more are displaced without access to food, clean water, or medical care. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7951.081s">Passing</a>  a ceasefire resolution affirms that Medford is a community that opposes this needless violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7957.723s">And</a>  it also affirms that Medford is a community that believes that the life of our Muslim and Arab siblings, as well as all of our neighbors that have experienced state sanctioned violence and the harms of colonialism are precious. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7970.242s">Second,</a>  passing this resolution puts important pressure on our federal elected officials who can use their power to call for a permanent and immediate ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7979.372s">This</a>  resolution will put pressure on Representatives Clark and Senators Warren and Markey to end the current humanitarian crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7986.4s">We'll</a>  also put pressure on them to vote against the legislation that's currently before the Senate that will provide an upwards of $14 billion in military aid to Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=7996.445s">And</a>  this will help ensure that our tax dollars do not go towards intensifying a genocide. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8001.668s">So</a>  with that, I urge you to pass a ceasefire resolution tonight so that we can affirm the preciousness of the lives of all of our neighbors and to use our voice to call for an end to this violence.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8012.313s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8012.914s">And</a>  I apologize for missing the warning.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8020.814s">name</a>  and address for the record, and I'll remember the 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_74]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8023.8s">Thanks,</a>  Travis Benson, 353 Main Street on Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8027.981s">I</a>  am aware this is a scarf and not a keffiyeh. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8031.403s">I'm</a>  doing my best, but I am here to support the resolution as it is currently amended for ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8037.865s">I</a>  don't know what else to say tonight that won't already be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8042.146s">There'll</a>  be many mentions from everyone here of the atrocities and casualties that have been going on with the decades long conflict with Israel and Palestine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8055.392s">Maybe</a>  I'm simplistic and rigid in my thinking, but this conversation becomes really difficult for me whenever it strays away from the overwhelming asymmetric casualty rate that has continued for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8071.75s">as</a>  if this is a nuanced issue and that the agitation and cause of the loss of life must be explained or elaborated on further. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8078.378s">As</a>  more and more towns and cities pass these resolutions, and taking a stance on a ceasefire becomes much safer for everyone's public image and costs less and less political capital, history will look less and less fondly towards votes <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8092.674s">not</a>  in favor of this resolution, attempts to delay its passage, or suggestions to water the language down. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8099.358s">I've</a>  witnessed in-person other city meetings that have already taken votes on a ceasefire, and I would just like to note that it is very obvious to everyone watching, and will be even more obvious tomorrow, of the strong dissonance and disconnect that exists between the visible turnout in this room versus the passivity and appeasement that exists in all of tonight's four speeches.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8120.111s">We</a>  must always recognize that- 30 seconds, Travis.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8371.06s">Hello,</a>  I'm Esther Alter, I live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8374.28s">I</a>  am a Jew, and I grew up in a very Zionist synagogue, and I'm well aware of the emotional component to this, that the Zionists want security, and they're on a perpetual defensive posture. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8397.887s">I</a>  am not a Zionist. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8399.708s">We</a>  are a minority, and we always will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8404.69s">And</a>  our safety is contingent on being generous and empathetic neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8412.074s">If</a>  the institutions ostensibly representing our interests continue to fail to call for the end of the genocide of our neighbors because they don't want to divide a community or make some people feel unsafe, then we will always be divided, and we will never be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8430.981s">Cease</a>  fire now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_61]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8431.721s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_47]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8444.207s">Deborah</a>  Cooper, 112 Lawrence Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8449.25s">I</a>  stand for the sanctity of human life and culture, and I admire the courage of this council in bringing this motion forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8458.456s">Beloved</a>  American poet Maya Angelou has said that of all the virtues, courage is the most important because without it, no other virtues can be performed consistently. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8471.533s">How</a>  do you build the courage to stand up to injustice? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8475.036s">You</a>  start with something small, like a weightlifter who begins with a few pounds and builds up to 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8482.283s">You</a>  stand up against injustice and it feels good, so you do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8488.349s">Six</a>  years ago, we stood up against injustice and the Muslim immigration ban, and that felt good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8497.702s">Along</a>  with many Medford residents, I ask this council to show your courage by passing the ceasefire resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8506.11s">Free</a>  Palestine, ceasefire now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8507.992s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8612.831s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8623.176s">Thank</a>  you, Benjamin, 76 Marion Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8627.439s">I'm</a>  a recent new Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8629.58s">I</a>  appreciate the resolution being forward today and I want to speak in support of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8633.722s">I</a>  don't have any personal ties to Palestine or Israel, but like many here, the events unfolding since October 7th have deeply impacted me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8640.506s">The</a>  ongoing killing in Gaza and the West Bank, the displacement of an entire people from their homes without a safe place to go, without enough food, water, medicine is horrifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8649.071s">And</a>  as a resident of this country, I feel the responsibility to speak up today because the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8653.796s">is</a>  not just a powerful player in this conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8656.219s">It</a>  doesn't have just leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8657.861s">It</a>  is, alongside Israel, the main perpetrator of the suffering of the Palestinian people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8662.106s">It</a>  is with U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8662.787s">bombs</a>  and U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8663.467s">fighter</a>  jets that the Israeli military has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8668.473s">It</a>  is our administration that has and continues to fund this war. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8671.554s">It</a>  is our administration that stands alone in the world in vetoing one ceasefire resolution after another in the UN Security Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8677.716s">It</a>  is our administration that two weeks ago suspended all funding for the main UN organization providing humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza, the UNRWA. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8686.518s">Our</a>  elected administration is not just a bystander to this genocide, but an active participant that is able to stop this war tomorrow if it wants to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8693.64s">That's</a>  why I think it matters that cities like Medford pass a ceasefire resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8698.121s">It</a>  demonstrates to our community, in particular its Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, as well as Jewish and Israeli members, that we care about their lives and that of their relatives, friends, colleagues, that we fully condemn the loss of life, the complete destruction of housing and basic human services and goods in Gaza, that we value all human life, that we want everyone to feel safe here and to feel comfortable to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8718.604s">And</a>  it demonstrates to our government that the city of Method does not stand behind the support of the ongoing genocide, that we stand for peace and immediate ceasefire now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8727.187s">The</a>  more cities that pass resolutions like this, the higher will be the pressure on Biden to stop this war now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8733.629s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8896.806s">You</a>  have 30 seconds, Pri.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_72]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8900.049s">He's</a>  brought awareness to the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8902.491s">And</a>  so I'm just going to quote him on his 107th day when he was finally able to flee Gaza and just say, always remember to say, free Palestine.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8923.368s">Hi,</a>  my name is Eric Fox. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8924.708s">I</a>  live at 10 Revere Place. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8928.189s">I</a>  first of all, foremost want to thank the Councilor Collins for bringing forth this resolution calling for a ceasefire. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8935.291s">I</a>  personally am Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8937.391s">I</a>  have, like many others that have spoken today, have grandparents that were survivors of the Holocaust and other members of my family who I never got to know because they were killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8949.074s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8952.062s">More</a>  importantly, I've experienced antisemitism in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8957.984s">I</a>  have also experienced and seen and witnessed Islamophobia and xenophobia in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8965.107s">And</a>  so I applaud the council for bringing and talking about this issue and just hearing all of these stories tonight, hearing everyone and hearing how this conflict has been affecting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8977.472s">personally</a>  makes it clear that this is not purely a national issue that should be ignored by a local city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8986.017s">It's</a>  not something that doesn't qualify as a local Medford issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8990.479s">This</a>  clearly is a Medford issue that is affecting its residents and in a very deep and personal way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=8997.623s">So</a>  I encourage you to vote for this ceasefire amendment, the amended version in the resolution, and I hope you do because it clearly is very important to Medford locals. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9011.816s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_58]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9012.197s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9020.993s">Yes,</a>  my name is Dina Alemi. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9023.114s">I</a>  live at 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9025.995s">I</a>  was not prepared to speak tonight, but I felt that as a Palestinian American, I should share my story and my family's story. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9035.12s">My</a>  parents both grew up in Jaffa, which is now Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9040.922s">They</a>  were also forcefully pushed out into Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9045.464s">I</a>  have lost a lot of family in Gaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9051.478s">Many</a>  of my family members in the North do not have food. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9055.901s">They</a>  are lucky that their house is still standing, but all they're really eating is herbs and contaminated water. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9064.666s">This</a>  is not a political issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9067.622s">This</a>  is a humanity issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9070.343s">We</a>  need to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9071.963s">We</a>  need to be there for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9074.985s">And</a>  I thank you all for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9077.425s">I</a>  really hope that you all will vote in support of this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_61]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9081.007s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_60]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9090.55s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9091.55s">For</a>  the record, you have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=9093.031s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
