[SPEAKER_13]: On a three nothing, the motion is approved and the minutes have been approved.

27
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:41,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight's agenda, new business 2024-58 on petition permit parking on Gourley Road, 24, seven Sundays and holidays excluded from George Street, 261 Gourley Road, left side and 17 Dwyer Circle, right side.

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the petitioner present this evening?

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Raise your hand, wave, we'll let you present the petition.

30
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone here from Gourley Road?

31
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:06,154
[SPEAKER_06]: She called me on the telephone to see why we weren't up, but she was supposed to be staying on.

32
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:08,595
[SPEAKER_06]: She was there.

33
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:14,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Alicia, I believe in the chat we have a Mark is present.

34
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:18,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, okay.

35
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:20,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Mark, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

36
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:24,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, can you unmute yourself?

37
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, can you hear me all right now?

38
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent, we can hear you now.

39
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:33,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, and the floor is yours for the petition.

40
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:52,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, I don't mind the petition, but there is a couple of changes I'd like made, because unfortunately, taking into account the beginning with the parking permit at 61 Gawley, it's gonna shift the balance of parking down to the lower end where I live at 20.

41
00:02:53,814 --> 00:03:03,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, by Barry Park, Goley Road, between the tennis courts and the basketball courts, there are times you can't even get up the street with parking on both sides.

42
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:17,548
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people coming from College Ave, Summer Ave, the two smallest streets that are down by the 7-Eleven that are coming up the park, because unfortunately, the conversion of single-family homes to three and four and five

43
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:23,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Apartments or condos is quadruple the amount of cars that are parking in that area.

44
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:33,346
[SPEAKER_00]: I would my only concern is that they would extend it all the way down to at least where I am just before the tennis courts on the it's the even side.

45
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:37,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

46
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:43,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark, you're here to comment on it, and I understand the comments, but are you the actual original petitioner?

47
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:44,574
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we were looking for first.

48
00:03:44,614 --> 00:03:45,274
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not.

49
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:52,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just found out about this through the letter that was mailed to the abutters, I believe, or the neighbors on that street.

50
00:03:55,001 --> 00:04:01,865
[SPEAKER_13]: R.D., that would match up with the name I was just given of Rose Davidson, but R.D., welcome.

51
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:05,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you please unmute yourself?

52
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you can unmute yourself?

53
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,659
[SPEAKER_13]: We are having a banner night tonight.

54
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:17,099
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

55
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, she said the host wasn't allowing me to talk.

56
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:22,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.

57
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:22,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

58
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:28,184
[SPEAKER_13]: So we heard we I know you just heard Mark and his petition, but you are the petitioner.

59
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:32,765
[SPEAKER_13]: So you want to go forward with that with the idea of the concept and what you're actually looking for.

60
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:33,506
[SPEAKER_13]: The floor is yours.

61
00:04:33,946 --> 00:04:34,386
[SPEAKER_13]: And welcome.

62
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:34,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

63
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:37,767
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, so I've lived here since 1988.

64
00:04:38,067 --> 00:05:01,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Seen a lot of changes in the area from when it was the Dame School to the Tufts Administration Building, then the bus lines coming down George and now the Green Line, then Tufts students housing expanding to George Street and beyond.

65
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:20,586
[SPEAKER_12]: So what's happening is, as you can imagine, a lot of the permit parking has taken place and gone into effect on, if you're coming from Main Street going west down George to the left, that's mostly permit parking now.

66
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,948
[SPEAKER_12]: And what's happening is the residents

67
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,383
[SPEAKER_12]: tenants, I should say, a lot of them are using Gourley Road for overflow.

68
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:42,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Say they have a two family that they rent out and the unit has parking for two cars in the driveway while the other four roommates are coming onto streets like Gourley Road.

69
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:45,594
[SPEAKER_12]: So we get that, they get the tenants, the Tufts students doing that.

70
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:49,276
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have, since the administration building for Tufts is now

71
00:05:51,238 --> 00:06:00,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Up at the top of the street of Goley Road, we have Tufts employees who park almost every day.

72
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:01,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of them are contractors.

73
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:04,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I've talked to them and I asked them, do you work for Tufts?

74
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,268
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm a contractor.

75
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:11,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I work two or three days here in this building and then I go to another school or whatever.

76
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,693
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, okay, but it's all day.

77
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:18,016
[SPEAKER_12]: They probably pull up around 8 and they leave around 5, 5.30.

78
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:36,328
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have those, then we have now the commuters who usually take the bus, the 94, the 96, and you see them because they park, they walk up with their backpacks, they take a right on Georgia left, and then I leave to go get my coffee and I see that same person at the bus stop.

79
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:40,731
[SPEAKER_12]: So we got those, and then we got the green line, which

80
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:59,797
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a neighbor actually, he was on Dwight's Circle, he parked, he got out of his car, this gentleman, looked for signs, didn't see any signs, got out of the car, walked up gorely, and my neighbor actually followed him all the way up to the green line.

81
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:04,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Got on the green line, my neighbor came back and he said, yep, he went to the green line.

82
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:07,749
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, Okay, there's another one.

83
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:12,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Then we also have people that use, you know, our street for the airport.

84
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:24,030
[SPEAKER_12]: You see them pull up park, get their suitcase out 1030 at night, here comes the Uber, they jump in the car, and we don't think that car is here for about four or five days.

85
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:29,307
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, again, Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins games.

86
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:30,309
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's great.

87
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:36,637
[SPEAKER_12]: You can take the green line, but you got people even in North Medford that come down here and park and go to the Bruins games.

88
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:40,742
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so my issue is really

89
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:47,661
[SPEAKER_12]: We, the people that live here, we just want to come home either without groceries.

90
00:07:48,122 --> 00:08:01,052
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a lot of families with young children, infants who want to pull up and take that kid out of the car in front of their house without putting them in a stroll and a walk up five houses into their homes.

91
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:05,936
[SPEAKER_12]: We have people that work, we have nurses that work, you know, seven to 11 or

92
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:08,278
[SPEAKER_12]: At night, they come home.

93
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:14,303
[SPEAKER_12]: They got to walk a block because they can't get in their house in the middle of the night.

94
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:16,525
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's time.

95
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:18,507
[SPEAKER_12]: I can go on and on and on.

96
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,649
[SPEAKER_12]: We got the buses from Tufts we got to deal with.

97
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:33,132
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, the deliveries that we want in front of our house for say we get a couch, we got to find out who's in front of our house, go to Tufts, call Rocco DiRico.

98
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:35,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you tell the person to come move the car?

99
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:37,779
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a refrigerator coming.

100
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:37,839
[SPEAKER_12]: So

101
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:40,620
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's time.

102
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I ask a clarifying question?

103
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:50,427
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're looking for George up to 61 Gawley, and then the petition says 17 Dwyer Circle.

104
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:57,172
[SPEAKER_13]: So I assume that's the first house on Dwyer Circle that cuts off of Gawley, but it's the backside of it.

105
00:08:57,212 --> 00:08:59,293
[SPEAKER_13]: So it makes it kind of an angle.

106
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:04,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that what the petition is exactly for, and not further down by the field?

107
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:08,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the baseball, I mean, this is always a mystery.

108
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,414
[SPEAKER_12]: You walk 50 feet and you can park in front of a field and no one's gonna bother you.

109
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:26,886
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, 17 actually, Dwyer Circle is 17, it faces Summer Street actually, but their side door is on Gourley Road and they park there.

110
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,209
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know he, it's a,

111
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:39,993
[SPEAKER_12]: The landlord lives in Winchester or Andover, but his tenants, they're very nice.

112
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:43,053
[SPEAKER_12]: They pull up on Goldie Road on the side there.

113
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:49,715
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, 17, their front door faces literally on the street.

114
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

115
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:51,536
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have an issue with that.

116
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:54,677
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to clarify where the program starts and ends.

117
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:55,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

118
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, stand by one second.

119
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:06,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner Hunt, any questions of the petitioner before we open it up to further public comment?

120
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:15,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Is the petition for down to 61 and 17 or is it down to 20?

121
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:26,281
[SPEAKER_12]: The petition is for, I had it written here, it is for

122
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:39,494
[SPEAKER_12]: I worded it from George Street to 61 Gorley Road on the left, because that's the last house before the baseball field.

123
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:43,880
[SPEAKER_12]: And then 17 Dwyer Circle is right across from 61 on the right.

124
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:55,811
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's just that half of Gourley, is that?

125
00:10:56,872 --> 00:11:04,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, that's where people come off like they literally turn the corner and then pull over.

126
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:10,404
[SPEAKER_12]: I get the people down to Gourley Road the rest of the way, may want it as well, but the park is all the way on that other side.

127
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:13,928
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't, we are inundated with

128
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:28,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, that busy part of the Green Line, Tufts, the students, the buses, they're all up there.

129
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,771
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just trying to get the clarification now.

130
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:39,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Can Alva confirm, so we have the petition, it's signed by a lot of these addresses.

131
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,786
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not signed by the families at 17 Dwyer.

132
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:48,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Fun fact, I know the owner now and she lives up there.

133
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:49,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Sandra?

134
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:50,756
[SPEAKER_14]: His wife.

135
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:51,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

136
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

137
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:53,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Laura.

138
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:55,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Very, very nice.

139
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:59,098
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'll tell you, he, he only has a tenant on the first floor.

140
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,460
[SPEAKER_12]: On the second floor.

141
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,301
[SPEAKER_12]: No one's in there.

142
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:02,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now.

143
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:03,404
[SPEAKER_12]: They were doing it over.

144
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:06,227
[SPEAKER_12]: But the woman on the first floor, I try to catch her.

145
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:06,968
[SPEAKER_12]: She's very nice.

146
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:08,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, she I can't seem to catch her.

147
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,571
[SPEAKER_12]: She's a teacher.

148
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:14,956
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll see if I'm going to when this ends.

149
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:23,583
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to sort of understand what, do we have all the signatures, usually all the checks?

150
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:33,811
[SPEAKER_13]: From the chair, we have signatures from that segment, George Street up to the Gooley Road where Dwyer Circle starts.

151
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:44,123
[SPEAKER_13]: We did ourselves reach out to the entire road, and while they are not represented on the petition, we received two phone calls from residents in that.

152
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:45,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just look here.

153
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:46,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Two, three, four, five.

154
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:54,975
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably six homes there that are in favor of the petition, and I'm not sure if any of them else are present here this evening, so we haven't gotten a public comment.

155
00:12:55,475 --> 00:13:07,071
[SPEAKER_13]: But it may be possible we hear from others, but the petition itself represents that segment, but we have heard since we contacted the entire street, we have heard from others in favor of the petition.

156
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,315
[SPEAKER_13]: If that helps the commission.

157
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:14,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it seems to me that it is very confusing to people to do less than a full block.

158
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:24,751
[SPEAKER_14]: But to be clear, it has been our policy that if there is along the side of a public park, we would never put permit parking there.

159
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:32,055
[SPEAKER_14]: We would put like two-hour parking, something that allows people to move through and use the park.

160
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:44,461
[SPEAKER_14]: And I certainly would be in favor of some sort of two or three hour parking along the park to discourage commuters from using it, but to keep that space available for park users.

161
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:50,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is something that we discussed when we discussed the outer green zone.

162
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,426
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a term for it.

163
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:53,546
[SPEAKER_14]: I still have the map here.

164
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,162
[SPEAKER_14]: to go the outer area of the green line.

165
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:04,667
[SPEAKER_14]: I would much rather see a regional parking solution and not street by street parking.

166
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:08,971
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that works better and is better for the community.

167
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:10,332
[SPEAKER_14]: What does that mean?

168
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:17,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, when we make the entire area permit parking, and if you live in that area, you can park on

169
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:22,754
[SPEAKER_14]: any of the streets, it's not just restricted to your street, you could live around the corner.

170
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:35,001
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, somebody with an address of Dwyer Circle could not park on Gourley Road because their address would be Dwyer Circle, even though half their house is on Gourley Road.

171
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:38,863
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's just the example that's on this map that is relevant here.

172
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:41,904
[SPEAKER_14]: But we see that all the time with corner houses, right?

173
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,045
[SPEAKER_14]: The corners on George,

174
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:48,108
[SPEAKER_14]: would not be allowed to park on Gourley if their address unless they get a special variance.

175
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:53,811
[SPEAKER_14]: When you do regional permit parking, you just say all the streets in this region are in the permit.

176
00:14:54,351 --> 00:15:00,154
[SPEAKER_14]: If you live in this region, you all can park on those.

177
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:11,681
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to allow the tenants who don't have enough room in the driveways in their rental properties and they

178
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:14,110
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to come over here and back.

179
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:30,638
[SPEAKER_14]: So right now there's already a regional permit and the ones that are on the other side of George Street, if they register their cars in Medford, can get a permit for the Green Line region and they can park on those streets over there.

180
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:35,020
[SPEAKER_14]: There is not a zone on this side of George Street.

181
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:45,978
[SPEAKER_14]: But if somebody lives in an apartment and they have proof, they have a lease or whatever, and their car is registered in Medford, then they can get a permit on the street that they're living in.

182
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:50,701
[SPEAKER_14]: So the streets, the apartments on your road would be able to get the permits.

183
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:53,723
[SPEAKER_14]: It wouldn't just be restricted to property owners.

184
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:58,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, let's do this.

185
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:00,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's hear from others.

186
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:08,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark had already presented, and I want to know if he would like to present again now that we've heard the petition in specific.

187
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,813
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's ask Mark to unmute and see if he wants to kind of repeat his comments.

188
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:21,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Mark, welcome back.

189
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,149
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know you already presented, but we've heard from the petitioner now.

190
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:27,009
[SPEAKER_13]: You're a resident of Gooley Road.

191
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to restate or add any facts to what you've already said?

192
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:31,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, absolutely.

193
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:34,653
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there almost 30 years myself on that street.

194
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:39,354
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a huge increase, like the petitioner said, in cars.

195
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:48,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, unfortunately, when you convert houses from single, you go from maybe three cars to nine or 10 cars for each house.

196
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:50,019
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work with our neighborhoods.

197
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:51,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, she's correct.

198
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:04,328
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I look out my front window and I see people grab, like she says, grab the backpacks and this is parking down by the baseball field and the tennis courts in front of my house at 20 and they grabbed the backpacks and they're off and running.

199
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:07,967
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the T. There's a gentleman that lives down on this.

200
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,708
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the exact name of the street.

201
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,430
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little, uh, little circle street down.

202
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:19,535
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if you go down across from the end of, uh, Gawley, um, he has a construct construction contractor business.

203
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:23,838
[SPEAKER_00]: He parks three vans there at a time because he can't fit them all in front of his house.

204
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:30,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem at all with people parking the whole side down there in the park side could be left alone.

205
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can park all they want from the tennis courts down can park all they want.

206
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:44,002
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like to see it extended from 61 because if you stop at 61, that person's going to drive another 50 feet, park in front of the houses that are further down.

207
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:48,566
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it alleviates the problem for them, but it puts the pressure on our end of the street.

208
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:54,028
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just seeing, you know, would like to see an equal distribution in that case.

209
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:54,809
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we're going to.

210
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,730
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want custom to move 4 or 5 spots.

211
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,550
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them to move.

212
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Either off the street to find some parking in Medford.

213
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:03,792
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's options.

214
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:13,257
[SPEAKER_00]: where they could find, or like she says, these people that don't live there, they work in town, they come from all over and drop their cars and run.

215
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:22,201
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but it's really kind of an unfair to ask the rest of the street to pick up the overflow.

216
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:32,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, if you're in a parking lot, stop and shop, if there's no spots up front, you park 10 spots back, which is exactly what's gonna happen on this street.

217
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:35,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the park side open.

218
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,249
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's fine.

219
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the tennis court side open.

220
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're asking for about maybe four more houses.

221
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:46,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I appreciate your comments and thanks for your participation.

222
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:50,893
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Dee Healy.

223
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:58,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Unmute yourself.

224
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:03,642
[SPEAKER_13]: I chief.

225
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:04,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Good welcome.

226
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:07,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you Sir, I'm going to keep it brief.

227
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:08,544
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you crunch for time.

228
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:10,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with both petitioners.

229
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:20,969
[SPEAKER_17]: I think putting the permit any way that we can figure out a way to do it to reduce the amount of Parkers that are really commuters and not residents of the community.

230
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,190
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's going to be a win.

231
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,011
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with all the comments I've heard and I thank you for your time.

232
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:27,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much and no objection.

233
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:30,333
[SPEAKER_13]: George to summer or

234
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:38,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I might have already lost you, okay.

235
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:40,715
[SPEAKER_17]: No objection, Chief, no objection to that at all.

236
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:43,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, appreciate it.

237
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:44,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to go back to the petitioner.

238
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:49,858
[SPEAKER_14]: There was one more, a person who put a note in the chat.

239
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:52,479
[SPEAKER_14]: So JMAC, should we give them an opportunity?

240
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, let's hear from JMAC first.

241
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:55,860
[SPEAKER_13]: JMAC.

242
00:19:57,675 --> 00:19:59,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, what a normal name that I have there.

243
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:00,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, how's it going?

244
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:01,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

245
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:01,916
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

246
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:07,458
[SPEAKER_15]: I live across the street from Rose, and I agree with everything that was said here.

247
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:22,522
[SPEAKER_15]: You're just getting a lot of traffic, and that congestion on both sides can often cause a lot of, you know, issues when you're pulling onto George, and you see people every day going up and down the street with backpacks and suitcases, so I just wanted to echo what was already said, and I agree with the petitioner, so thank you.

248
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very, very much for your participation.

249
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:33,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Going back to the petitioner now, I'm going to ask a question for you.

250
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:42,752
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you've heard that there's a number of other people here who are suggesting that not limited to Dwyer Circle, but extended George to Summer, excluding the Parkside.

251
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:48,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have a specific objection, or did you just not reach that end of the street, or do you have a preference on that?

252
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:55,785
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that you can do as long as our section is permit packing.

253
00:20:56,065 --> 00:20:59,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever everyone wants on their end of the street, I'm all for.

254
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:05,712
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really, you know, I don't know what goes on down there.

255
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:06,492
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

256
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,614
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.

257
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

258
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:14,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anyone else who wants to speak to this point, either in favor or against the petition?

259
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:21,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Raise your hand, put something in the chat.

260
00:21:21,677 --> 00:21:28,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, seeing none, commissioners, questions, concerns?

261
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:31,043
[SPEAKER_13]: I also have Director Blake and Sergeant Rogers.

262
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Any issues on that side of things?

263
00:21:35,746 --> 00:21:36,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I can get an answer.

264
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:38,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, thanks everyone.

265
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:40,669
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in full support of this.

266
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,911
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's just the tip of the iceberg because I think

267
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,294
[SPEAKER_19]: Once this approves, Marsden and other streets will probably come in with similar issues because it's just pushing the problem.

268
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:53,297
[SPEAKER_19]: So the GL zone fixed it over there, and then this is the result.

269
00:21:53,397 --> 00:22:00,241
[SPEAKER_19]: It's pushing outside that zone, and then it's getting worse for these neighboring streets, and it's likely to occur again.

270
00:22:00,322 --> 00:22:03,524
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would definitely recommend supporting this and approving this.

271
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:21,322
[SPEAKER_19]: but be mindful that maybe we circle back and revisit the outer zone in the future that was previously denied because this is the reason why we had asked for it before so I think it would be beneficial as Alicia mentioned at some point but for now I'd approve this individual one.

272
00:22:22,183 --> 00:22:23,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you Director Blake.

273
00:22:23,764 --> 00:22:25,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner Hunt, Commissioner McGibbon.

274
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:30,415
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Todd touched on my point.

275
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:32,377
[SPEAKER_18]: This might cause Marston to come in.

276
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:38,401
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think this is exactly what I wanted to see when it comes to how these zones are created.

277
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:45,046
[SPEAKER_18]: So now we can identify or start to keep track of the overflow from the G zone.

278
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:46,947
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm in favor of this petition.

279
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:49,689
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we can do it for the whole block, I would prefer that.

280
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:51,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Good.

281
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:52,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Raishan?

282
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:57,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I guess this is the first way to get this started.

283
00:22:59,167 --> 00:22:59,427
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

284
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:03,049
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a better way to get a motion.

285
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:21,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, move to approve approve the permit parking for the entire street of Gourley with the exception of I believe I got some inside information that the park has 3 hour parking.

286
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:25,300
[SPEAKER_14]: So that the park is 3 hour parking.

287
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:36,777
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't Jim did we have some sort of exception for residents after or something like that, or it's just three hour parking along the park.

288
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:38,882
[SPEAKER_10]: It's three-hour parking.

289
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:41,404
[SPEAKER_10]: The example I was giving was Tufts Park.

290
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:43,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Along Tufts Park is three hours.

291
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:53,431
[SPEAKER_10]: We had talked to the recreation folks, and most games are three-hour long, and it is resident parking on Morton Avenue from 10 p.m.

292
00:23:53,611 --> 00:24:04,898
[SPEAKER_10]: till 8 a.m., and then it's open for people who participate in the park activities, but it prevents commuters from parking there and walking up to the Green Line.

293
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:08,169
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so I prefer consistency around the city.

294
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:21,021
[SPEAKER_14]: So if it was resident permit parking with along the park, three hour parking during the day and permit parking only 10 p.m.

295
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:21,822
[SPEAKER_14]: to 8 a.m.

296
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:26,466
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be consistent.

297
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,488
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure that that's consistent.

298
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,538
[SPEAKER_13]: To me, that's consistent with what now.

299
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:41,643
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the residents was pointing out, how is that handled with odd and even parking in the winter with snow and stuff like that?

300
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:46,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that matter?

301
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:48,487
[SPEAKER_14]: How do we handle that?

302
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:54,050
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my understanding that resident parking is not enforced during a snow emergency.

303
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct, Chief?

304
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:59,093
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct, and the same rules will apply, especially in the park side there.

305
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it should have no impact at all.

306
00:25:07,404 --> 00:25:14,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so Alicia, you, I heard everything you said, and I made my notes and the petition is for resident permit parking.

307
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:22,330
[SPEAKER_13]: And you want to include in this motion, the 3 hour parking on the park side.

308
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:34,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so, or else we will just end up with commuters, et cetera, scooting up there and parking in front of the park all day long and making it hard on people using the park.

309
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:35,816
[SPEAKER_18]: Agreed.

310
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:37,356
[SPEAKER_18]: And I second that whole motion.

311
00:25:37,376 --> 00:25:38,577
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

312
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:49,862
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Commissioner Hunt, for resident permit parking 24-7, Sundays and holidays excluded, from George Street to Summer Street,

313
00:25:51,845 --> 00:25:57,790
[SPEAKER_13]: with the Parkside limited to three-hour parking during the day and permit parking from 10 p.m.

314
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,715
[SPEAKER_13]: to 8 a.m., I'll have a roll call.

315
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:04,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

316
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:05,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

317
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:07,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

318
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:08,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

319
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

320
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

321
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:13,964
[SPEAKER_13]: On the vote of three to nothing, one absent, the motion is approved.

322
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:19,626
[SPEAKER_13]: You will have resident private parking in that whole area.

323
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:21,868
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to take us a little bit of time, right?

324
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:22,849
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going to happen tomorrow.

325
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:23,789
[SPEAKER_13]: I always give this caveat.

326
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:28,232
[SPEAKER_13]: I can never tell you exactly when it is, but we will work on this and then move it forward for you.

327
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:34,696
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank all of you who participated and spoke on this and all of you who put up with our delay and thank you for that.

328
00:26:35,337 --> 00:26:36,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.

329
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:48,757
[SPEAKER_13]: 2024-59, request from Marion Street residents for no parking here to Corner Sides, both side of Marion Street at Winchester Street, excuse me, submitted by Ms.

330
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:51,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Anna Campbell, 75 Marion Street.

331
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:52,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Is Ms.

332
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:53,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Campbell present?

333
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:01,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Kristen Nelson there, you wanna speak on this?

334
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:04,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, let's see if we can get you to unmute.

335
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:08,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you unmute yourself?

336
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:16,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Technology has so many pros and cons.

337
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:18,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Believe me, I'm going to contonate tonight.

338
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:22,098
[SPEAKER_14]: There should be something popping up on your screen.

339
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:23,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

340
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:24,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no.

341
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:25,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything?

342
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:26,840
[SPEAKER_13]: You see a sign on your screen?

343
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Unmute.

344
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:33,883
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're on a phone, swipe left and see if you see a big button asking you to unmute.

345
00:27:38,394 --> 00:27:38,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

346
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:39,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

347
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:40,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

348
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:41,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

349
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:45,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It says Kristen Nelson, but it's really Ann Campbell.

350
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:48,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

351
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:49,804
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Anna Anna.

352
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:50,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Ann.

353
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:52,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Ann Campbell.

354
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:52,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

355
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,288
[SPEAKER_13]: And the floor is yours.

356
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:55,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

357
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:04,957
[SPEAKER_04]: We are petitioning to have two signs, one for each side of the street, no parking from here to corner.

358
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:21,832
[SPEAKER_04]: because we are having, since the G zone for the T has moved in in July, we are having people parking way too close to the corner and hanging over onto Winchester Street.

359
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:26,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And larger vehicles are not able to come around the corner.

360
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:38,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have had a few emergency vehicles, fire trucks, that have not been able to get around the corner where the cars parked on both sides.

361
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:59,205
[SPEAKER_04]: The odd side of the street has a fire hydrant and they park right at the fire hydrant with no clearance and they park right in front of number 80 and they hang on over to Winchester Street and you just can't get larger vehicles around the corner.

362
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:09,646
[SPEAKER_04]: We have school buses that come around, we have oil trucks, we have emergency vehicles, and you just can't get around the corner when they park too close.

363
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:15,889
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to get two signs so that they won't park too close to the corner.

364
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:23,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much for, you can see, we just put the map up here.

365
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:26,774
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I do go down there, it is tight.

366
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:28,875
[SPEAKER_11]: I've gone down a couple of times.

367
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:33,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we have the no parking 20 feet anyways, but they're not adhering to it.

368
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:36,084
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe the signs would help.

369
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:45,606
[SPEAKER_13]: As Sergeant Rogers said, that we do have an ordinance and a law that there's no parking 20 feet from, in this case, it would be Winchester Marion Street.

370
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:53,328
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some issues with enforcement on that, but that is already a standard or a law within this city for us to follow.

371
00:29:55,288 --> 00:30:01,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wish I had thought to take pictures because this is not generally what the street looks like during the day.

372
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:06,092
[SPEAKER_13]: I will add that both the traffic sergeant and myself, this is, Ms.

373
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:17,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Campbell, this is not the first time you've complained about this and we've tried some enforcement areas and you brought this to our attention a number of times and it may require the next step of signage and enforcement.

374
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:22,997
[SPEAKER_13]: But I agree with you that it's not typically looking like this on the average day.

375
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:27,784
[SPEAKER_13]: commissioners before I open it up to the floor.

376
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:36,449
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm fine with this unless Todd or somebody has some reason why we wouldn't do this at this location.

377
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:37,630
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds like it's needed.

378
00:30:39,231 --> 00:30:40,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything Commissioner McGibbon?

379
00:30:41,232 --> 00:30:48,016
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing I would say is this sign pollution would be signing in an already enforceable condition.

380
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:55,208
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, that's my only point, but it doesn't look like there's a lot of signs in this area.

381
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:01,024
[SPEAKER_18]: Would we wanna increase the 20 feet?

382
00:31:01,164 --> 00:31:06,826
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I'm much more in favor of signs if we need to like increase that 20 feet zone.

383
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,568
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if Todd has any opinions on that.

384
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:10,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Director Blakey.

385
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:12,129
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I was just gonna say.

386
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:12,709
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Tim.

387
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:22,853
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's just a matter of enforcing the 20 foot rule and we want, if Tim was okay with putting signs up, we wouldn't even need a vote because it's just a sign reinforcing the existing rule.

388
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:25,895
[SPEAKER_19]: We usually only bring it to traffic commission when it's beyond the 20 feet.

389
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,797
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't looked at this particular 1 on the left with the hydrant.

390
00:31:30,837 --> 00:31:34,319
[SPEAKER_19]: it should be more than 20 feet already because it's plus 10 to the hydrant.

391
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,861
[SPEAKER_19]: So, on the right side, maybe it needs a little more.

392
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:46,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Peggy in the chat just hit your point a little so the hydrant does extend that further than that.

393
00:31:46,046 --> 00:31:47,167
[SPEAKER_13]: So that that is 100%.

394
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:48,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, working on the crap quarters here.

395
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:05,425
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that side's already basically 28 or 30 anyways if you go from the hydrant.

396
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:08,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so Director Blake is doing some measurements.

397
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:15,711
[SPEAKER_13]: If you took into enforcement the markings of the hydrant from the corner and added the 10 feet beyond that, that would be almost 30 feet on that side.

398
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:18,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe just 20 feet at 25 on one side.

399
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:21,835
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's now looking and recommending 25 on the other side.

400
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:24,436
[SPEAKER_13]: So what he's suggesting is that

401
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:34,708
[SPEAKER_13]: The hydrant rule may be the one that is kind of in question on the other side of the street where people are encroaching on that hydrant.

402
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:44,333
[SPEAKER_13]: And second, I've always recommended 25 feet on the near side, what would be south side of Marion Street.

403
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:49,435
[SPEAKER_13]: So if that helps the commissioners.

404
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:56,179
[SPEAKER_18]: It does for me, because I think we could put a sign at the end of the hydrant zone, no parking here at a corner.

405
00:32:57,085 --> 00:32:59,946
[SPEAKER_18]: And we could put one on the other side of the recommended 25 feet.

406
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:15,110
[SPEAKER_18]: And upon, I presume this is recommended by the traffic surgeons too, from what I'm hearing, this is a condition that we feel needs a little bit of extra step beyond normal rounds of enforcement.

407
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:22,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, correct, and this has been brought to our attention by the petitioner a number of times, and it definitely needs some, it would help us with enforcement, let's put it that way.

408
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:30,951
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, then I'll move to do what I just stated, the right side, 25 foot, and the left side, end of the hybrid zone.

409
00:33:33,032 --> 00:33:34,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Would be 10 feet from the hybrid.

410
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:35,473
[SPEAKER_19]: If I may, Chief?

411
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:35,813
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

412
00:33:36,453 --> 00:33:41,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Since this traffic commission regulatory changes, maybe the vote is only really for the 25.

413
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:46,337
[SPEAKER_19]: The other one's just a sign reinforcing the existing 10 feet.

414
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:46,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

415
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:47,577
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

416
00:33:50,005 --> 00:33:54,751
[SPEAKER_14]: It just to be clear, though, whatever sign you would put up, like, normally, I would think of a sign.

417
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:55,232
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, no.

418
00:33:56,293 --> 00:34:05,045
[SPEAKER_14]: No parking hydrant, but what you really need is no parking to corner because it sounds like people are parking between the hydrant and the corner.

419
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:10,409
[SPEAKER_04]: They park directly at the hydrant and back to the corner.

420
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,870
[SPEAKER_04]: They ignore the hydrant completely.

421
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:20,413
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't just want people thinking, oh, I didn't park next to the hydrant, but I can park between the hydrant and the corner because that sounds like it's one of the problems.

422
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:23,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, could we paint the corner yellow?

423
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:26,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know what else you can do for people not to park there.

424
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:29,436
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we're just going to try these signs, I think.

425
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,057
[SPEAKER_18]: And Alicia.

426
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:35,450
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah and Alicia they would be the same signs no parking here to corner.

427
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:36,210
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

428
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:45,458
[SPEAKER_13]: All right so let me give a shot at well let me ask if anyone else wishes to speak on behalf of this or against this in public raise your hand put something in the chat.

429
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:54,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay seeing none on the motion of commission of a given let me give this a try.

430
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:15,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Establish a sign on the north side of Marion Street, no parking here to corner to reinforce the 10-foot hydrant rule as well as the corner rule, and a 25-foot no parking here to corner on the south side of Marion Street.

431
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:17,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Good enough?

432
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:19,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

433
00:35:20,124 --> 00:35:21,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion seconded by?

434
00:35:21,044 --> 00:35:23,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, second.

435
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:24,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

436
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:27,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote, please.

437
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:28,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

438
00:35:29,092 --> 00:35:29,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

439
00:35:29,652 --> 00:35:30,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

440
00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:31,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

441
00:35:32,813 --> 00:35:33,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

442
00:35:34,214 --> 00:35:34,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

443
00:35:35,994 --> 00:35:39,435
[SPEAKER_13]: On a vote of 3-0 with one absent, the motion is approved.

444
00:35:40,656 --> 00:35:44,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, that will take a little bit of time to get those signs established and get them out there.

445
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:50,378
[SPEAKER_13]: It takes a little bit of work, but we'll get some increased parking enforcement, traffic enforcement on this.

446
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely thank you for your attention to this matter.

447
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your petition and for being patient with us.

448
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:57,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.

449
00:35:57,921 --> 00:35:58,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks a lot.

450
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:02,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

451
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:07,645
[SPEAKER_13]: 2024-60, Handicap, Arkansas, William Crowell, 119 Bowdoin Street.

452
00:36:07,705 --> 00:36:10,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Crowell, is someone here to speak on behalf?

453
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,366
[SPEAKER_13]: I see a Bill Crowell.

454
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:13,586
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to ask you to unmute.

455
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:16,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

456
00:36:16,627 --> 00:36:16,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

457
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:17,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

458
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:19,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome to the Traffic Commission.

459
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,788
[SPEAKER_01]: You can present your petition.

460
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:22,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

461
00:36:22,928 --> 00:36:26,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some parking in front of my house.

462
00:36:27,441 --> 00:36:31,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, I've had a couple heart attacks and some bypass surgery.

463
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:45,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes, you know, I live on Bullard Street, Bullard College kids, and sometimes I'm like around the block, down the block, walking can be a problem for me sometimes, especially if I have to carry something.

464
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:48,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I'm not supposed to carry anything over 10 pounds.

465
00:36:49,096 --> 00:36:50,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I do go shopping,

466
00:36:51,397 --> 00:36:58,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down the street, and I have to stop in the middle of the street and bring one bag out of the car.

467
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:02,740
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a driveway, but we're not allowed to park in it.

468
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,141
[SPEAKER_01]: She said it's for emergencies.

469
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:08,522
[SPEAKER_01]: She lets the cars just park in there when there's no emergencies.

470
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:13,183
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't want to be blocking the cellar doors in case somebody has to go down and do work.

471
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:20,090
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just that I really need the park in front of my house.

472
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:23,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes my life so much easier.

473
00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:32,500
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd like to say a couple of times, I have heart disease, a couple of heart attacks, and open heart surgery, and bypass.

474
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here about 30 years.

475
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:39,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just need help from the city.

476
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:40,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to do anything else.

477
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:45,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about it for me.

478
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:50,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I had some other place to park, if I could park in a driveway, I would.

479
00:37:50,753 --> 00:37:53,435
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't park in a driveway.

480
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if I could, I can't open my door.

481
00:37:57,537 --> 00:37:58,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't open my door.

482
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to keep it simple and sweet.

483
00:38:04,087 --> 00:38:05,288
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best I can do.

484
00:38:05,668 --> 00:38:06,728
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you did fine.

485
00:38:06,788 --> 00:38:08,249
[SPEAKER_13]: And Alvaro, all the paperwork is in order?

486
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:09,050
[SPEAKER_13]: It is.

487
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so the commissioners, the paperwork is in order.

488
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:15,834
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just trying to take a quick look.

489
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:18,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioners, any questions of the petitioner?

490
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:39,247
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think that it's useful to mention, as we usually do in these cases, that if, so you must have a handicapped placard or plate or something to use the spot if we create it, and it's a public handicapped spot, so if somebody else has a legitimate handicapped tag, they also can use the spot.

491
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:40,607
[SPEAKER_14]: It can't be reserved for you.

492
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:45,930
[SPEAKER_14]: But if people without handicapped placards are using it, call the police and they'll come ticket them.

493
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:47,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

494
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:48,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.

495
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:52,570
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it's just nice to have one there and go shopping or something.

496
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to, I don't have to, I don't have to want to hurt myself anymore.

497
00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:00,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

498
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:02,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Chris, should we give him anything?

499
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I went down there Sunday, let me just say,

500
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:07,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a problem, I believe, on the right.

501
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:09,133
[SPEAKER_11]: The driveway is on the left.

502
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:17,376
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make note to the commissioners that it's going to be the fourth handicapped spot within a two-block radius on Bowdoin Street.

503
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,637
[SPEAKER_01]: There is two of them right now.

504
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:22,858
[SPEAKER_01]: There was two of them removed.

505
00:39:22,938 --> 00:39:24,698
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one across the street.

506
00:39:25,418 --> 00:39:30,120
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two of them across the street which were removed on my block.

507
00:39:31,278 --> 00:39:42,001
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a, there was a, um, on, on the left-hand side on, on the left-hand side of the, on the even side, there was two of them and they were removed, um, a couple of years ago.

508
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:48,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one, I have one, um, and I have one next to me, but they have two handicapped right, right there.

509
00:39:49,024 --> 00:39:57,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, they switch up and it's just, it's not, it's not a lot, you know, but as far as I know on my block, there was only two.

510
00:39:58,787 --> 00:39:59,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

511
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:10,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe further down the other end there is, but down my block, my father's street.

512
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:16,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me ask, does anyone else here speak in favor of the petition or against the petition?

513
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:22,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, just wave your arm, raise your hand, something in the chat.

514
00:40:24,304 --> 00:40:26,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, seeing none, to the commissioners.

515
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:29,849
[SPEAKER_14]: I would move approval.

516
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:38,716
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Commissioner Hunt to approve a handicapped parking sign at 119 Bowdoin Street for Mr. Crowell.

517
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:43,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Commissioner McGiven.

518
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Alva, roll call vote.

519
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

520
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:46,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

521
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:48,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

522
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:49,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

523
00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:50,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

524
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:54,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that's a approval, three to nothing to one absent.

525
00:40:54,988 --> 00:40:57,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Crowley, your handicap sign has been approved.

526
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:05,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I give a normal caution and advisement that it won't go up necessarily tomorrow, but we're going to do some work and get it out there as fast as we can.

527
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:06,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.

528
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:08,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in no hurry.

529
00:41:08,714 --> 00:41:10,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how it works.

530
00:41:11,275 --> 00:41:11,556
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

531
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:12,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, sir.

532
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,737
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your patience with us.

533
00:41:13,957 --> 00:41:14,157
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

534
00:41:14,257 --> 00:41:16,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been great.

535
00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:16,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

536
00:41:17,398 --> 00:41:17,718
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

537
00:41:17,738 --> 00:41:17,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

538
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:31,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, okay, that was 2024-61 on petition stops on on Central Ave at Pool Street or Linwood Street from from Mr. Steven Shea, 33 Pool Street and others.

539
00:41:32,415 --> 00:41:36,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Shea, I'm going to ask you to unmute if you would like to present the petition.

540
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:43,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's good.

541
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:46,199
[SPEAKER_13]: We can hear you and welcome to the Traffic Commission.

542
00:41:46,259 --> 00:41:48,100
[SPEAKER_13]: If you'd like to present your petition, go ahead.

543
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:50,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I didn't realize it was a petition.

544
00:41:50,804 --> 00:41:52,745
[SPEAKER_08]: I just sent a letter to Ms.

545
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:58,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Erickson after meeting with her about our concern on Pool Street and Central Ave.

546
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,652
[SPEAKER_08]: The traffic is going way too fast.

547
00:42:02,013 --> 00:42:10,299
[SPEAKER_08]: We would like to see a stop sign probably at Linwood Street, the corner of Linwood Street where Morrison Park

548
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:16,304
[SPEAKER_08]: is and that we would hope would slow down the traffic.

549
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:26,973
[SPEAKER_08]: We noticed that Central Avenue from the Fells Way to Spring Street, there's no stopping any traffic.

550
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:34,300
[SPEAKER_08]: But from there down to Park Street, there were several stop signs at the intersections to slow down the traffic.

551
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:43,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've noticed right after I sent the letter, the speed bumps appeared.

552
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:50,178
[SPEAKER_08]: The neighbors think I have great power somehow, but that had nothing to do with this petition.

553
00:42:50,218 --> 00:42:54,561
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're just hoping you would look into that and see what makes sense.

554
00:42:55,462 --> 00:43:01,547
[SPEAKER_08]: to allow people to get out of Pool Street safely.

555
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:07,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, crossing to the park from Central Ave is an issue as well.

556
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, thank you for the petition.

557
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,110
[SPEAKER_13]: It's understood.

558
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:17,373
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're looking for it's either or pool or Linwood, but on Central Ave, right?

559
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:18,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

560
00:43:18,114 --> 00:43:21,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Linwood might be better because Linwood is a busier street.

561
00:43:21,616 --> 00:43:24,798
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also a two way street where full street is a one way.

562
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:25,458
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

563
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,099
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, then.

564
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:31,662
[SPEAKER_08]: See, there's a park at the Morrison Park.

565
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:31,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

566
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:52,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Director hunt can I have you go to Linwood and just to confirm that there's a stop sign coming on to central and then to pool to confirm that there's a stop sign from pool on to central and I'll tell you why I'm asking that question in general and I'm going to refer to director Blake in a minute general it's not like.

567
00:43:55,168 --> 00:44:05,538
[SPEAKER_13]: It's generally not a sound thing to do to put a stop sign in the middle of a major or larger street where there are side streets off.

568
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:08,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have an opinion on that or is that something to do?

569
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:10,042
[SPEAKER_13]: I might be completely wrong.

570
00:44:15,504 --> 00:44:25,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Given the current state guidance on stop sign control, stop signs are not supposed to be used as traffic calming, controlling speed.

571
00:44:25,334 --> 00:44:30,359
[SPEAKER_19]: They're supposed to be used for right of way control when it's unclear who has the right of way.

572
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:38,746
[SPEAKER_19]: So, the certain criteria that has to be met to put an always stop, like, and central and some of those other streets on the other side of spring.

573
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:46,733
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I believe that was done prior to me being here, but I believe that was based on crash history, but we did recently put.

574
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:53,398
[SPEAKER_19]: the speed table just east of pool on central for the very reason that you described.

575
00:44:53,478 --> 00:44:58,002
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a long straightaway with no breaks between the two traffic signals.

576
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:00,944
[SPEAKER_19]: That's one of the reasons why we chose that location.

577
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:03,726
[SPEAKER_19]: So hopefully it's helping a little bit.

578
00:45:05,007 --> 00:45:12,394
[SPEAKER_19]: But at this time, given the information I have at hand, I wouldn't recommend a stop on central

579
00:45:13,114 --> 00:45:18,318
[SPEAKER_19]: unless we looked into the criteria and it met it, it likely wouldn't meet it at Poole, definitely.

580
00:45:18,418 --> 00:45:19,338
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe Linwood.

581
00:45:19,819 --> 00:45:30,946
[SPEAKER_19]: So those other examples on the other side of Central, on the other side of Spring, like Otis and others like that, those are two-way streets that go all the way from Salem all the way to Washington across Central.

582
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:34,129
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think there was Crash History is what I gather.

583
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:40,113
[SPEAKER_19]: These are two T intersections, so they're not introducing as much traffic into Central.

584
00:45:40,693 --> 00:45:47,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Usually it's more reserved for when two streets are roughly equal and it's confusing the people with one without the right of way.

585
00:45:47,438 --> 00:45:49,020
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand.

586
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,782
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not meant for slowing people down.

587
00:45:51,902 --> 00:45:52,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

588
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:52,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I get that.

589
00:45:52,922 --> 00:45:53,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

590
00:45:56,485 --> 00:45:58,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what else to say.

591
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:15,218
[SPEAKER_08]: It was an attempt to do something because people are really having a difficult time, whether it's, as in the previous examples of the petitions, parking too close to the corners and trucks there.

592
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:18,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Commercial trucks that are staying there all day.

593
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a problem.

594
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:21,702
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't see.

595
00:46:24,524 --> 00:46:33,211
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds like you're saying parking on Central near the corners, if that was freed up, it would enable- It's on Pool Street too.

596
00:46:33,371 --> 00:46:37,755
[SPEAKER_08]: People who don't live on Pool Street are parking on the corner of Pool Street.

597
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,498
[SPEAKER_08]: People from Central Ave, for example, contractors and so forth.

598
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:43,560
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't see getting out.

599
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how many times we've all been hit.

600
00:46:46,122 --> 00:46:47,563
[SPEAKER_03]: We were close to being hit.

601
00:46:47,643 --> 00:46:47,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

602
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:51,360
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't stop and we're just standing there.

603
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,981
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we do?

604
00:46:52,722 --> 00:46:55,247
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we get out without an accident?

605
00:46:55,823 --> 00:47:14,837
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do think there's, I know you're just here, and I haven't gone to the rest of the commissioners for their opinions, but certainly from a police perspective, there's a number of things we can do, including some increased enforcement, but we can put some traffic advisement signs up there in the neighborhood to bring notice to it.

606
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:18,180
[SPEAKER_13]: But as you heard in the last petition, there is a,

607
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:24,785
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a rule about parking the 20 feet from the intersection on the corners there.

608
00:47:25,226 --> 00:47:30,110
[SPEAKER_13]: So combined, I think a lot of that might alleviate if we just put a little extra attention on it.

609
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:37,415
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it may be more beneficial than going against the norm and establishing a

610
00:47:38,376 --> 00:47:43,622
[SPEAKER_13]: stop sign in the middle of the street, but let me go to the commissioners and seek their opinions first on that one.

611
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:48,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner Hunt, Commissioner McGiven, thoughts on what the petitioner is stating?

612
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Other thoughts that we might be able to address?

613
00:47:52,668 --> 00:47:57,589
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wondering if it's better now that the speed bump is there.

614
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:03,370
[SPEAKER_08]: It is better, but not really great.

615
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:09,211
[SPEAKER_08]: People fly over those speed bumps and take the hit, you know what I mean?

616
00:48:10,171 --> 00:48:11,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

617
00:48:12,352 --> 00:48:20,093
[SPEAKER_14]: I do know that I have learned that the speed bumps are designed to slow you to 25 miles an hour because that's

618
00:48:20,712 --> 00:48:24,314
[SPEAKER_14]: the legal speed to be driving there.

619
00:48:26,355 --> 00:48:30,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes people see the sign speed table and it slows them down until they get used to it.

620
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:35,660
[SPEAKER_14]: I would also think people aren't parking on central, like literally on the speed table.

621
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,602
[SPEAKER_14]: So it kind of disrupts some of the, but that you said that the problem is on pool.

622
00:48:42,243 --> 00:48:44,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the exit from pool to central.

623
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:47,466
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two streets that come out onto Central Ave.

624
00:48:48,322 --> 00:48:49,042
[SPEAKER_03]: going in there.

625
00:48:49,722 --> 00:48:59,705
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only two streets that go on to Central Ave, and then you have a freeway all the way down to the Fellsway, and they're speeding.

626
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:02,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can't see.

627
00:49:02,266 --> 00:49:05,947
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot see with the trucks and the cars on Central Ave.

628
00:49:06,127 --> 00:49:06,907
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't see.

629
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:11,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're inching out, and you're hoping to God there's nobody coming.

630
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not the only one that has voiced this.

631
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:24,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think you I don't want to your our position here to think that we're diminishing your concerns.

632
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:27,529
[SPEAKER_13]: We know concerns and wholeheartedly we will.

633
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:32,933
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that I was just talking with Sergeant Rogers behind here is not only can we put up

634
00:49:33,253 --> 00:49:37,497
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, like the signs that will say slow down 25 miles, but we can do a traffic study.

635
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:43,342
[SPEAKER_13]: We can get a measurement of how many vehicles are traveling on central and the speeds at which they're going at.

636
00:49:43,782 --> 00:49:49,807
[SPEAKER_13]: And it will give us a really good estimate say, whether it's done over a week's time or 2 weeks time of what we're facing there.

637
00:49:49,827 --> 00:49:53,110
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we can adjust either adjust enforcement there or revisit.

638
00:49:55,312 --> 00:50:03,960
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's important that you're bringing this to our attention so that we can kind of adjust our strategies and tactics for the area.

639
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:11,086
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just not a normal thing to do to put a, as you say, it's a major.

640
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:19,251
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to call it an honoree, but we know that vehicles tend to pick up speed because they have the right of way generally.

641
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:30,577
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in their mindset by Mass General Laws and the street design that they have a right of way and people are less cautious, I guess they tend to be, especially in today's day.

642
00:50:31,077 --> 00:50:35,460
[SPEAKER_13]: And so putting a stop sign up is generally not advisable for us in that case.

643
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,202
[SPEAKER_13]: But we can do a lot to kind of look at this problem and study it.

644
00:50:40,262 --> 00:50:42,163
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, that's very reasonable.

645
00:50:42,203 --> 00:50:43,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

646
00:50:43,503 --> 00:50:44,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hold on one second.

647
00:50:44,463 --> 00:50:56,487
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to see what... Can we motion to deny the request but refer the problem to the traffic division for further follow-up?

648
00:50:57,943 --> 00:51:00,545
[SPEAKER_13]: We can, we've done that in the past to some success.

649
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:03,527
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't think we need to keep it on our agenda.

650
00:51:03,547 --> 00:51:04,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that the item is done.

651
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:11,532
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys will deal, and if you all determine that something regulatory is needed, you'll put it back on the agenda.

652
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:17,535
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you can manage it without regulatory decisions, you'll just take care of it.

653
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with that.

654
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:21,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner McGibbon, your thoughts?

655
00:51:22,566 --> 00:51:27,432
[SPEAKER_18]: It's already on the radar at the engineering office, obviously with the speed tables there.

656
00:51:27,572 --> 00:51:30,976
[SPEAKER_18]: We hear complaints about this corridor, Central Avenue speeding.

657
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:33,819
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think there's two parts here.

658
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,503
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an enforcement and whatever the patrol units can do.

659
00:51:39,665 --> 00:51:48,289
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's the work that the engineering office is already doing, and I'm sure Director Blake has got all kinds of creative ideas for this particular stretch.

660
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:51,730
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a matter of time and observing and getting feedback.

661
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:57,733
[SPEAKER_18]: So we appreciate your openness to providing that feedback, and we'll continue to pursue solutions that work.

662
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:03,782
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would be a second of Commissioner Hunt's motion?

663
00:52:04,182 --> 00:52:05,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, a long-winded second.

664
00:52:05,942 --> 00:52:06,262
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

665
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:23,827
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Commissioner Hunt to deny petition 2024-61 for a stop sign on Central Ave, but to refer the matter to the Medford Police Department and their traffic unit, and that will

666
00:52:25,948 --> 00:52:32,413
[SPEAKER_13]: bring about an increased enforcement with some advisements and a traffic study done in that area, seconded by Commissioner McGibbon.

667
00:52:32,593 --> 00:52:34,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Albert, a roll call vote, please.

668
00:52:34,915 --> 00:52:35,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

669
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:36,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, indeed.

670
00:52:37,277 --> 00:52:37,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

671
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:38,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

672
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

673
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I'm three to nothing, to one absent.

674
00:52:43,462 --> 00:52:44,643
[SPEAKER_13]: That motion is approved.

675
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:52,047
[SPEAKER_13]: And while we deny the petition, I think we might be able to come up with some better solutions for you and work our way through that.

676
00:52:52,227 --> 00:52:57,290
[SPEAKER_13]: And you make sure you stay in touch if there's a problem outside of that.

677
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:01,852
[SPEAKER_13]: But I thank you for your participation this evening.

678
00:53:01,872 --> 00:53:04,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

679
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:16,898
[SPEAKER_13]: 2024-62 crosswalks across Winchester Street at New Bern Ave, North Crossing, Morton Ave, South Crossing, and Granville Ave, North Crossing.

680
00:53:17,198 --> 00:53:21,282
[SPEAKER_13]: That is Director Blake, and so I will turn the floor over to Director Blake.

681
00:53:23,624 --> 00:53:26,526
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, my map's here if you need that or don't worry.

682
00:53:54,861 --> 00:54:06,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner Hutt, can you bring up the area of Morton and Wichester and that area on yours to share?

683
00:54:07,626 --> 00:54:08,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

684
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:10,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Using my desktop is going to share some things.

685
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,890
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't both share at the same time though.

686
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:21,849
[SPEAKER_14]: New Bern and, sorry.

687
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:25,990
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you want for us to?

688
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,311
[SPEAKER_19]: We could start either one, Felicia.

689
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:33,852
[SPEAKER_19]: Winchester at New Bern right there, yeah.

690
00:54:34,673 --> 00:54:36,373
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think we said North, South North, right?

691
00:54:36,393 --> 00:54:36,973
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right, yeah.

692
00:54:36,993 --> 00:54:38,274
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to look at the petition.

693
00:54:38,354 --> 00:54:39,454
[SPEAKER_19]: If you could do the aerial.

694
00:54:39,894 --> 00:54:47,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so basically there's already existing wheelchair ramps at these three locations and this will enable

695
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:51,450
[SPEAKER_19]: better enable people to safely cross Winchester.

696
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:59,179
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now, there's only a crosswalk painted up at Albion and Broadway, Somerville, and down at Harvard Street.

697
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,345
[SPEAKER_19]: So pretty much the entire length of Winchester has no painted crosswalks currently.

698
00:55:05,066 --> 00:55:13,934
[SPEAKER_19]: And by painting these, it will help facilitate safe crossings from the neighborhood to the green line back and forth into the parks at Tufts Park and some other areas.

699
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:20,760
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll better alert the drivers, because people are already crossing there, there's already ramps, it's already crossing.

700
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:29,387
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just to paint them and to make them more awareness to drivers that to expect pedestrians crossing there.

701
00:55:29,768 --> 00:55:31,970
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'd paint it and add warning signs as well.

702
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,180
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all four?

703
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:44,882
[SPEAKER_19]: The two on the side streets, we usually don't come to the traffic commission, but we plan on painting the crossings on the side streets.

704
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:49,142
[SPEAKER_19]: But across Winchester, only one of the two at each location.

705
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:55,103
[SPEAKER_19]: We picked the ones that had the better alignment of ramps and better visibility.

706
00:55:57,264 --> 00:56:01,965
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's the north, south, and the north, as the response says.

707
00:56:03,705 --> 00:56:04,145
[SPEAKER_14]: This one?

708
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,216
[SPEAKER_19]: also.

709
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:10,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

710
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,643
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've also recently added a radar feedback sign in Winchester.

711
00:56:19,063 --> 00:56:20,744
[SPEAKER_19]: The police already had one in one direction.

712
00:56:21,205 --> 00:56:23,126
[SPEAKER_19]: Engineering just added one in the other direction.

713
00:56:23,686 --> 00:56:31,151
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're trying to change the character of that street and control the speeding just like the previous complaints for Central Ave.

714
00:56:31,251 --> 00:56:32,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Winchester Street is the street we get

715
00:56:33,572 --> 00:56:42,455
[SPEAKER_19]: Habitual complaints about that, so we're trying to change the character introducing these painted crosswalks with warning signs and the radar feedback signs.

716
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:45,336
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully change the character of the street.

717
00:56:45,356 --> 00:56:47,437
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not just the.

718
00:56:50,998 --> 00:56:51,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Sense to me.

719
00:56:51,858 --> 00:56:55,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, okay.

720
00:56:55,659 --> 00:56:57,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have any questions.

721
00:56:59,098 --> 00:57:00,499
[SPEAKER_13]: No questions from Commissioner McGiven.

722
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:01,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me open up the floor.

723
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:06,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Does anyone here wish to speak in favor of this petition adding crosswalks on Winchester Street?

724
00:57:12,386 --> 00:57:15,047
[SPEAKER_13]: And does anyone here wish to speak against the petition?

725
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:16,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Have any concerns against the petition?

726
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:23,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I don't see anything.

727
00:57:23,852 --> 00:57:25,113
[SPEAKER_13]: No concerns either way.

728
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to the commissioners.

729
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:33,310
[SPEAKER_13]: A motion for approval or denial, I guess?

730
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval.

731
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:36,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, second.

732
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:52,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, on the motion of Commissioner Hunt for crosswalks across Winchester Street and Newburn Ave, North Crossing, Morton Ave, South Crossing, and Granville Ave, North Crossing, as presented by Director Todd Blake.

733
00:57:52,954 --> 00:57:55,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have a roll call vote, please, and seconded by Commissioner McGibbon.

734
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

735
00:57:58,061 --> 00:57:58,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

736
00:57:58,281 --> 00:57:59,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

737
00:58:00,082 --> 00:58:00,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

738
00:58:00,842 --> 00:58:01,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

739
00:58:01,763 --> 00:58:02,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

740
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:05,565
[SPEAKER_13]: On a vote of three to nothing to one absent, the motion is approved.

741
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:13,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Director Blake, that has to be the fastest you've ever presented and got something approved here, sorry.

742
00:58:13,469 --> 00:58:19,512
[SPEAKER_13]: 2024-63, no parking anytime, 310 Lawrence Road, Northside, a distance of 20 feet at crosswalk.

743
00:58:20,193 --> 00:58:21,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Director Blake, again, the floor is yours.

744
00:58:23,118 --> 00:58:26,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Alicia, if you could share that as well, the 310 Lawrence Road.

745
00:58:26,823 --> 00:58:36,037
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the house, if you're traveling from Forest Street to Winthrop Street, it's prior to the crosswalk at Rural Ave.

746
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:37,018
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, exactly.

747
00:58:40,185 --> 00:58:44,907
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is very similar to a bunch of other previous requests to daylight a crosswalk.

748
00:58:45,548 --> 00:58:53,112
[SPEAKER_19]: So when cars park in front of 310, they kind of block the view of pedestrians wishing to cross there and pedestrians can't see the car coming.

749
00:58:53,492 --> 00:58:58,475
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's a lot of kids that cross in this area because the school bus stop is in the vicinity as well.

750
00:58:59,195 --> 00:59:06,459
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would just be looking to do what we've done elsewhere with the one car lane 20 feet prior to the crosswalk.

751
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:10,500
[SPEAKER_19]: We've done some other things there as well, but this is an addition.

752
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:15,001
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've added an in-street sign there to create warning.

753
00:59:15,521 --> 00:59:16,721
[SPEAKER_19]: We've trimmed that tree.

754
00:59:17,661 --> 00:59:22,342
[SPEAKER_19]: We're trying to create more visibility of the sign in the sidewalk itself, in the crosswalk itself.

755
00:59:22,462 --> 00:59:26,403
[SPEAKER_19]: So the restricting one parking space will help with that.

756
00:59:26,623 --> 00:59:31,004
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe it would still remain one parking space in front of that house, so we wouldn't

757
00:59:32,405 --> 00:59:36,827
[SPEAKER_19]: necessarily take away the space that's entirely from the crosswalk to the driveway.

758
00:59:37,127 --> 00:59:38,167
[SPEAKER_19]: It'd be about half that.

759
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:50,092
[SPEAKER_19]: And most of the houses on Lawrence Road are single family with big driveways, but again, this would still, it would only take one of roughly two spaces in front of that house.

760
00:59:51,652 --> 00:59:52,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

761
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:53,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Director Blake.

762
00:59:54,073 --> 00:59:56,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Before we open up to public comment, Commissioner McGibbon, Commissioner Hunt.

763
00:59:59,157 --> 01:00:03,778
[SPEAKER_18]: In general, I like these requests, and I think they go a long way.

764
01:00:04,978 --> 01:00:07,498
[SPEAKER_18]: I hear that people appreciate them as well, so I'm in favor of this.

765
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:19,841
[SPEAKER_14]: I have just one question, sort of a side question, is that I've had a few people ask me if we were planning to do bike lanes on Lawrence Road, since it's a major thruway to the high school.

766
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:25,582
[SPEAKER_14]: And this seems like if there was a bike lane, you wouldn't need a daylight parking spot.

767
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:27,962
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just curious about that.

768
01:00:30,177 --> 01:00:33,619
[SPEAKER_14]: if that's a project that's on the radar or anything.

769
01:00:33,739 --> 01:00:39,142
[SPEAKER_19]: Lawrence Road, I would say is a target area for potentially doing that.

770
01:00:39,962 --> 01:00:58,573
[SPEAKER_19]: What I'd like to do before that becomes what the traffic commission would be to collect data of the parking utilization on both sides of the street to confirm that there's less than 50 percent occupancy and that we've done on a high street and winter street in certain areas.

771
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:06,807
[SPEAKER_19]: And then that would lead to potential bike lanes, at least one direction, if not both.

772
01:01:09,108 --> 01:01:09,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

773
01:01:09,828 --> 01:01:11,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

774
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:14,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone wishing to speak in favor of the petition?

775
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:19,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Just wave your arm, raise your hand in the chat group.

776
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:26,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anyone wishing to speak against the petition or have an objection?

777
01:01:27,196 --> 01:01:33,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Or any other general question related to the petition for no parking at 310 Lawrence Road?

778
01:01:33,783 --> 01:01:41,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, seeing none.

779
01:01:43,688 --> 01:02:03,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I did receive a phone call from the owner of that home, and she has no objection to the sign for daylighting the 25th, but there was presently another sign posted in front of her house, and she didn't feel that she liked two signs posted in front of her house.

780
01:02:04,669 --> 01:02:06,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, did the commissioners hear that?

781
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:07,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just repeat it out loud.

782
01:02:07,591 --> 01:02:14,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Alba received a phone call from the homeowner at 310 Lawrence Road, who is no objection to this petition.

783
01:02:14,717 --> 01:02:22,062
[SPEAKER_13]: But if we can look at that, her concern is that there already is a sign in front of the home, and I believe that that's probably the crosswalk.

784
01:02:22,763 --> 01:02:30,869
[SPEAKER_13]: And as to if there's something that could be done where she did not have 2 poles in front of her house, that's more of a question for probably Commissioner McGiven.

785
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:34,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Director Blake.

786
01:02:34,391 --> 01:02:44,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Normally that pedestrian warning sign would be closer to the crosswalk right at it or maybe on that telephone pole, but that tree when it's in bloom blocks anything behind it, right?

787
01:02:45,076 --> 01:02:48,438
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why that warning sign is before it in this case.

788
01:02:49,305 --> 01:02:53,607
[SPEAKER_19]: So in general, yes, that existing sign would be closer.

789
01:02:53,627 --> 01:03:04,172
[SPEAKER_19]: The no parking sign, if we wanted to use the same pole, we'd probably have to add a taller pole so that there's enough clearance.

790
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:09,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Usually we don't add the parking restriction signs to the same traffic.

791
01:03:10,396 --> 01:03:11,176
[SPEAKER_19]: warning sign.

792
01:03:11,817 --> 01:03:14,100
[SPEAKER_19]: And I assume it would have to be pulled back, right?

793
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,481
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, exactly.

794
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:19,025
[SPEAKER_19]: It would have to be posted exactly at 20 feet so it would be a little further back.

795
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:20,407
[SPEAKER_19]: We could consider that.

796
01:03:20,447 --> 01:03:28,115
[SPEAKER_19]: I wouldn't want to make any promises because there's a lot of competing interest there with the height and the visibility and other things.

797
01:03:29,211 --> 01:03:38,621
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, in general, if we can reduce, as Tim said, the number of polls to get the same effects, then we will, but sometimes we can't.

798
01:03:38,741 --> 01:03:45,128
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't see how having those 2 having that sign and then another sign 3 or 4 feet from it would look kind of weird.

799
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:54,448
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, if Aggie wants to eliminate that tree, though, so no, that's a joke.

800
01:03:54,508 --> 01:03:59,211
[SPEAKER_19]: The warning sign is such that because if it's moved elsewhere, it's not visible.

801
01:03:59,311 --> 01:04:02,293
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's just nature of this particular area.

802
01:04:03,934 --> 01:04:05,275
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone asked if we could paint too.

803
01:04:05,555 --> 01:04:08,257
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes we do paint the daylight areas with hatching markings.

804
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:12,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Usually, we try to match the character of the current street or neighborhood.

805
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:21,185
[SPEAKER_19]: This street currently doesn't have necessarily markings there, but I think if and when we add the shoulder lines, that makes sense to do that as well.

806
01:04:23,407 --> 01:04:25,668
[SPEAKER_19]: That just highlights the no parking area.

807
01:04:27,729 --> 01:04:29,791
[SPEAKER_19]: But we need the sign for enforcement anyways.

808
01:04:39,605 --> 01:04:41,626
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm in favor, I would move approval.

809
01:04:42,387 --> 01:04:48,691
[SPEAKER_14]: If you can accommodate, like making it not multiple poles right there with different signs, that would be nice.

810
01:04:49,771 --> 01:04:53,974
[SPEAKER_14]: I assume she does not want that crosswalk sign upgraded to one of our flashy ones.

811
01:04:54,174 --> 01:04:56,795
[SPEAKER_14]: So keeping it simple.

812
01:04:58,556 --> 01:05:01,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we think there's a no parking

813
01:05:02,412 --> 01:05:06,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a daylighting zone, do we still need the crosswalk sign?

814
01:05:07,884 --> 01:05:09,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we do, but.

815
01:05:10,592 --> 01:05:16,574
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we'd still typically want it, because especially at night, it's more visible to drive.

816
01:05:18,354 --> 01:05:27,196
[SPEAKER_19]: Usually, most of the areas we've been trying to improve pedestrian safety has been a combination of efforts, the daylighting, the warning sign, and the in-street sign.

817
01:05:27,676 --> 01:05:32,638
[SPEAKER_19]: So between all these things, it changes to, you know, drivers say, all right, something's different here.

818
01:05:32,658 --> 01:05:34,638
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'd rather the extra awareness.

819
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Just trying to look at one last thing here.

820
01:05:46,885 --> 01:05:49,968
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I do believe there's still a motion, correct?

821
01:05:50,009 --> 01:05:59,980
[SPEAKER_13]: So a motion of Commissioner Hunt to approve 24-63, no parking anytime, 310 Lawrence Road, north side, distance of 20 feet, the crosswalk.

822
01:06:02,237 --> 01:06:09,700
[SPEAKER_13]: with the added consideration from the director and DPW to look at the sign issue would double up.

823
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that close enough, and is it seconded by Commissioner McGiven?

824
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:14,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, second.

825
01:06:18,623 --> 01:06:19,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Alba, roll call vote, please.

826
01:06:20,203 --> 01:06:21,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

827
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:22,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

828
01:06:22,104 --> 01:06:23,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Fent?

829
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:24,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

830
01:06:24,825 --> 01:06:25,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

831
01:06:25,725 --> 01:06:25,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

832
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:29,986
[SPEAKER_13]: On a vote of three to nothing to one, absent, the motion is approved.

833
01:06:33,307 --> 01:06:38,255
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will leave it to you guys to kind of take a look at the situation and see what we can do to resolve.

834
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:45,185
[SPEAKER_13]: 2024-64, Mr. David Newhall, Crockett Design Group 400, Mr. Gav, there's a project.

835
01:06:46,975 --> 01:07:02,385
[SPEAKER_13]: You can describe the project, but they are looking for a stop sign and stop line bar on Fulton full, excuse me, Fulbright Street at Mystic Avenue, and then a second no parking anytime both sides on Fulbright Street from Mystic Avenue to the first private driveway.

836
01:07:03,706 --> 01:07:08,029
[SPEAKER_13]: And I see a, there is a Mr. Collins with his hand up.

837
01:07:08,109 --> 01:07:11,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to assume that could be the petitioner.

838
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:17,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, just gonna try to get you to unmute yourself if that's working.

839
01:07:19,694 --> 01:07:20,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Collins.

840
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:21,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Chief Buckley.

841
01:07:21,836 --> 01:07:22,317
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

842
01:07:22,757 --> 01:07:24,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, come here, and the floor is yours.

843
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:25,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

844
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,962
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Matthew Collins with Crocker Design Group.

845
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:33,967
[SPEAKER_16]: We're the engineering firm representing Herb Chambers for this project.

846
01:07:36,229 --> 01:07:41,593
[SPEAKER_16]: In September, we went through permitting with the engineering department.

847
01:07:42,574 --> 01:07:49,677
[SPEAKER_16]: And we received our permit, and then in October, they had a few comments after the fact.

848
01:07:51,398 --> 01:08:05,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Specifically on Fulbright for the stop sign stop bar and for the no parking on either side up to that 1st driveway going into the proposed lot and.

849
01:08:07,606 --> 01:08:09,266
[SPEAKER_16]: So they wanted us to add those.

850
01:08:09,826 --> 01:08:14,087
[SPEAKER_16]: As part of that, they wanted Traffic Commission's approval.

851
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:18,528
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are just here for approval.

852
01:08:18,648 --> 01:08:20,348
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll try to keep it short for all of you.

853
01:08:20,368 --> 01:08:26,509
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you've been here for a while, so I'm willing to answer any questions you may have.

854
01:08:26,529 --> 01:08:27,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Much appreciated.

855
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:35,691
[SPEAKER_13]: And just for clarification, that is going on the bank property there, or is it on the opposite that where

856
01:08:37,274 --> 01:09:04,600
[SPEAKER_19]: so right where that mouse is that uh so we're going uh if you take a right to um where the bank is uh that's the proposed herb chambers uh headquarters okay excellent see if i could have before yep director blake uh so yeah they're coming before you because i requested this in relation to the uh review of that project so basically they're doing some other good improvements they're gonna up you know upgrade the crosswalk there into a

857
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:10,942
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to do a bump out to make it more teed off full bright at Mr gaps will be a shorter crossing.

858
01:09:11,462 --> 01:09:21,266
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is just to prevent parking between Mr Gavin the driveway, which is moving a little bit further up, but it will kind of clean those areas just like we heard from the residents.

859
01:09:21,306 --> 01:09:23,787
[SPEAKER_19]: If someone parked on either side in between those areas, it might.

860
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:29,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Lock the view of anyone coming in and out, and it's going to be more traffic between that little stretch there.

861
01:09:29,892 --> 01:09:35,236
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah, so it's only about 50 feet or so on either side of the street.

862
01:09:35,356 --> 01:09:42,622
[SPEAKER_19]: So, instead of the standard 20, because it's from the corner of the street, but then also the corner of their driveway, and it's going to be higher use driveway.

863
01:09:44,037 --> 01:09:54,786
[SPEAKER_19]: So if people are familiar with that street, sometimes you get a lot of people parking on Fulbright, because it's kind of one of those streets that, you know, people find out, oh, I could park there all day.

864
01:09:54,866 --> 01:10:02,573
[SPEAKER_19]: So this will just clean that up between the higher use areas of the turning movements coming in and out of that side street.

865
01:10:05,396 --> 01:10:06,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Leverett.

866
01:10:06,276 --> 01:10:07,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I always thought it was by the way.

867
01:10:08,018 --> 01:10:10,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm wrong.

868
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:15,939
[SPEAKER_11]: There are car carriers, tractor trailers, buses, everything else parking down there.

869
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:21,004
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if we could go further in restricting the parking maybe overnight.

870
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:25,327
[SPEAKER_11]: If it is, in fact, the public way.

871
01:10:26,148 --> 01:10:27,049
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a public way.

872
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:28,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I can confirm that.

873
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:37,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Restricting maybe the overnight parking because the tractor trailers, as Todd said, they park there and they leave their car there.

874
01:10:40,522 --> 01:10:41,503
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't go home.

875
01:10:42,383 --> 01:10:45,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry that we're going to debate this out loud a little bit.

876
01:10:45,345 --> 01:10:49,868
[SPEAKER_13]: But already there would be no open parking for the track to trail, correct?

877
01:10:50,388 --> 01:10:54,170
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just looking for it to be posted so that... I don't like it posted, no parking.

878
01:10:55,471 --> 01:11:07,718
[SPEAKER_19]: And if I may, that request by Sergeant Rogers would be similar to other restrictions we approved on the city portion of Mystic Ave, which restricted, I think, 10 p.m.

879
01:11:07,758 --> 01:11:08,579
[SPEAKER_19]: to 7 a.m.?

880
01:11:08,659 --> 01:11:08,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

881
01:11:10,216 --> 01:11:18,439
[SPEAKER_19]: We've done this on Commercial Street and Mystic Ave as well, to kind of get a little more control over the overnight people that are coming.

882
01:11:18,459 --> 01:11:19,339
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a dumping ground.

883
01:11:19,459 --> 01:11:19,679
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

884
01:11:20,299 --> 01:11:22,860
[SPEAKER_19]: And was the signage no overnight parking in commercial vehicles?

885
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,781
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it was just for everybody, no overnight parking at all.

886
01:11:27,822 --> 01:11:29,582
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it was either 10 or 11 p.m.

887
01:11:29,602 --> 01:11:30,522
[SPEAKER_19]: to 7 a.m.

888
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:32,623
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

889
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:36,984
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a consistent thing.

890
01:11:37,024 --> 01:11:38,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Todd, are you aware of the,

891
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:44,646
[SPEAKER_18]: The, the issue with full bite street and which portion is public and which portion is private.

892
01:11:44,666 --> 01:11:49,109
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought, based on the recs and engineering, this portion was public.

893
01:11:49,149 --> 01:11:50,830
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why I directed to the traffic.

894
01:11:52,331 --> 01:12:12,340
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that's come up for us with other things and we've looked into it a bit but in the planning office that Fulbright is a public road to about here where there's actually a gate at which point this portion of it is on private property.

895
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,824
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it was behind the former yoga studio.

896
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:20,429
[SPEAKER_19]: It's essentially the driveway to the building with the yoga studio floor.

897
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:23,953
[SPEAKER_19]: For those way back, the blockbuster video, I think.

898
01:12:24,934 --> 01:12:29,119
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say, I don't have it in front of me, but that is my recollection also, because that has been closed off.

899
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,161
[SPEAKER_13]: for my entire police career.

900
01:12:31,521 --> 01:12:31,922
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah.

901
01:12:32,142 --> 01:12:40,047
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a discrepancy because the record drawing for Fulbright Street has an acceptance plan for the portion that goes through the parking lot.

902
01:12:40,067 --> 01:12:43,770
[SPEAKER_18]: So the other portion and not this portion that we're talking about tonight.

903
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:51,535
[SPEAKER_18]: So there is a discrepancy and we brought it to the attention of the folks that own, I believe it's the car wash.

904
01:12:52,816 --> 01:12:57,679
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not really sure, but anyway, there is an issue with that right now.

905
01:12:59,898 --> 01:13:07,268
[SPEAKER_16]: And I could share my, I have our layout plan here that shows the area a little easier.

906
01:13:07,288 --> 01:13:07,929
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that'll help.

907
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:09,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would be great.

908
01:13:09,672 --> 01:13:13,858
[SPEAKER_14]: I was actually looking for my files to see if I had that to share, but.

909
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:27,811
[SPEAKER_19]: If for some reason it's not a public in this stretch, then the abutters of the private way could restrict what we're asking for anyways, or if we did it for safety, that is one of the things that we could do in a private way.

910
01:13:29,332 --> 01:13:40,560
[SPEAKER_16]: And so our property, and it goes through the middle of Fulbright, but there is that existing 50 foot wide easement that goes right through.

911
01:13:41,925 --> 01:13:46,546
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see the dashed line is the Herb Chambers property line in here.

912
01:13:47,306 --> 01:13:48,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

913
01:13:49,007 --> 01:14:11,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Just for, you know, just for what it's worth, we think that it's been misconstrued that the one that has seen improvements, the side that's seen improvements has been called the public side, whereas the side that has not seen any improvements or betterments is, for some reason, what was accepted by city council at some point in the 40s or something like that.

914
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:20,382
[SPEAKER_18]: I cannot, Todd, we gotta make sure we get you those records for that.

915
01:14:20,962 --> 01:14:23,025
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think we can necessarily vote on this tonight for that reason.

916
01:14:25,567 --> 01:14:26,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I agree.

917
01:14:26,808 --> 01:14:34,436
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think we could vote on the overnight thing if it's a private way, but near the corner, I believe the police are able to,

918
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:44,123
[SPEAKER_19]: To take it for safety violation on private ways, which would include corner restrictions and then the applicant or the petitioner.

919
01:14:44,763 --> 01:14:50,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Being 1 of the 2 or 3 of butters could also institute that themselves.

920
01:14:51,411 --> 01:14:54,534
[SPEAKER_19]: Signage potentially for the, for the.

921
01:14:56,603 --> 01:15:25,297
[SPEAKER_19]: no parking section for the stop sign if it's a private way it wouldn't be us either um if it's public it would so my apologies if there's some discrepancy it's out loud who can approve a stop sign if it's a private way if it's a private way the way the state law is written it's already a stop private way entering a public way so it's just a matter of putting up a sign to reinforce that okay

922
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, stop, as Todd was saying before, just clarifies who's right of way.

923
01:15:31,743 --> 01:15:34,365
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have to stop regardless if there's a stop sign or not.

924
01:15:35,486 --> 01:15:39,290
[SPEAKER_14]: But people don't know that it's a private way unless you put up a stop sign.

925
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:40,591
[SPEAKER_18]: That's for any ways.

926
01:15:41,272 --> 01:15:42,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Any ways, private or public.

927
01:15:42,473 --> 01:15:43,894
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have a way entering another way.

928
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:48,879
[SPEAKER_18]: It should be pretty obvious who's got the right of way.

929
01:15:48,939 --> 01:15:53,523
[SPEAKER_18]: And if it's not, we try to put up a stop sign if it's warranted.

930
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:59,783
[SPEAKER_19]: Because in a lot of suburban settings, you don't have a stop sign on side streets.

931
01:15:59,823 --> 01:16:01,685
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just understood, as Tim's saying.

932
01:16:03,006 --> 01:16:11,333
[SPEAKER_19]: But I would highlight that the petitioner is doing a lot of things that we've asked for to tighten this in section up so that for pedestrians and safety, it's gonna get a lot better than it is today.

933
01:16:12,914 --> 01:16:14,716
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is just furthering those efforts.

934
01:16:16,177 --> 01:16:19,460
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we know what he wants and I think it's,

935
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:25,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, it's a bit of a technicality here on whether this is a public way or not.

936
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:27,946
[SPEAKER_18]: We just reviewed this in engineering.

937
01:16:28,086 --> 01:16:31,087
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw the acceptance plan for the other half and not this half.

938
01:16:31,927 --> 01:16:38,349
[SPEAKER_18]: So for that reasons, I would move to table this until it can be known definitively.

939
01:16:38,369 --> 01:16:45,452
[SPEAKER_18]: If it is determined that it's a public way, this portion is a public way, then we could vote on it.

940
01:16:47,152 --> 01:16:49,333
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't think we should vote on it if we don't know.

941
01:16:50,574 --> 01:16:52,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm confused about the stop.

942
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:53,796
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's two different things, though.

943
01:16:54,156 --> 01:16:58,098
[SPEAKER_14]: The stop sign and the stop line, that was their request.

944
01:16:58,978 --> 01:17:01,179
[SPEAKER_14]: That I would think we could vote on.

945
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:09,083
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the part about parking restrictions that came from the traffic division that we certainly couldn't vote on if we don't know if it's a public way.

946
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:13,025
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the stop line and stop sign would be on private property.

947
01:17:14,965 --> 01:17:22,807
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, and I think the way I read mass general law when we looked into this last time is a private way entering to a public street has to stop already.

948
01:17:22,867 --> 01:17:25,628
[SPEAKER_19]: So regulatory wise, it's already there.

949
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:33,430
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a matter of the petitioner agreeing to paint and put the sign up, but it probably doesn't require a traffic commission at all if it's private way.

950
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:34,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

951
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,130
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be my understanding too.

952
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:39,231
[SPEAKER_18]: And we would approve it either way.

953
01:17:39,311 --> 01:17:39,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

954
01:17:45,123 --> 01:17:45,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

955
01:17:46,384 --> 01:17:46,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

956
01:17:46,724 --> 01:17:49,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have a timeframe of when we might get an answer on this?

957
01:17:49,366 --> 01:17:53,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Just private, public way, because the records exist in engineering, unfortunately.

958
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:54,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, exactly.

959
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,972
[SPEAKER_18]: I think within a day, I mean, we can finalize it tomorrow morning.

960
01:17:57,992 --> 01:18:04,436
[SPEAKER_18]: I think engineering has already finalized it with whoever they're directly dealing with on this issue.

961
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:10,981
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would just be a matter of me confirming it, me or Todd confirming it in the morning, basically with Owen.

962
01:18:13,712 --> 01:18:18,094
[SPEAKER_13]: And just for petitioner, then, I don't know the time frame of the project.

963
01:18:18,354 --> 01:18:24,397
[SPEAKER_13]: If you needed traffic commission approval, we would be asking you to come back the second week in December.

964
01:18:24,857 --> 01:18:29,319
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what that does to your time frame.

965
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:35,502
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can say this, I believe number one on the petition, stop sign and stop line bar on Fulton Street at Mystic Avenue.

966
01:18:37,223 --> 01:18:40,625
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if it's a public way, I think the traffic commission would vote yes.

967
01:18:41,882 --> 01:18:42,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I agree.

968
01:18:42,802 --> 01:18:43,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we should do that.

969
01:18:45,044 --> 01:18:50,506
[SPEAKER_13]: And that way, if it's a public ways, get approval for that one.

970
01:18:50,946 --> 01:18:54,088
[SPEAKER_13]: And if it's a private way, they can do it anyway, and should do it.

971
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:55,729
[SPEAKER_18]: A conditional approval?

972
01:18:55,749 --> 01:18:55,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

973
01:18:56,609 --> 01:18:57,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

974
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:08,074
[SPEAKER_13]: The second one, I think we should wait until we get some idea of whether or not it is a public private and can address it there with no parking issues.

975
01:19:08,835 --> 01:19:09,435
[SPEAKER_13]: That could work, yeah.

976
01:19:09,455 --> 01:19:10,956
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to do both conditional,

977
01:19:13,617 --> 01:19:14,037
[SPEAKER_13]: It's up to you.

978
01:19:15,078 --> 01:19:16,639
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll leave that part to the commissioners.

979
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:22,322
[SPEAKER_18]: We might as well just do them both conditional, because I think the end result is going to be the same.

980
01:19:22,422 --> 01:19:34,329
[SPEAKER_18]: So if it's determined that this is private, then we don't have jurisdiction, and maybe they'll do it anyway upon our recommendation or Todd's recommendation or a condition on the project, because I believe it's a site plan.

981
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:37,911
[SPEAKER_18]: So if it lands in the site plan conditions, then it's a site plan condition.

982
01:19:39,632 --> 01:19:51,299
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have that, and we wouldn't need to vote on it, but if it does turn out to be public, okay, yeah, we've already voted on it, and it becomes a site plan condition, so they'd be in good shape regardless.

983
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:59,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, you could report back to the traffic commission, so whether or not we log it as a public or as an approved traffic commission meeting, then we'll do it that way.

984
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:04,386
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, so on the motion of commission that were given to approve 2024-64,

985
01:20:07,688 --> 01:20:17,795
[SPEAKER_13]: conditionally for stop sign and stop line bar on Fulbright Street at Mr. Gav and number two, no parking, anything both sides of Fulbright for Mr. Gav to the first private driveway.

986
01:20:18,315 --> 01:20:27,421
[SPEAKER_13]: The condition will be determined by the engineering department as to whether or not that area or that section is in fact public or private.

987
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:30,163
[SPEAKER_13]: So if that sounds good to the commissioners.

988
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:33,163
[SPEAKER_18]: It does, I think that summarizes it well.

989
01:20:33,544 --> 01:20:35,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Alba, roll call vote, please.

990
01:20:35,847 --> 01:20:36,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded, Alicia.

991
01:20:36,989 --> 01:20:38,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, seconded by Commissioner Hunt, yes.

992
01:20:39,032 --> 01:20:39,493
[SPEAKER_13]: I jumped it.

993
01:20:40,695 --> 01:20:41,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

994
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:42,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

995
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:43,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

996
01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:44,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

997
01:20:45,009 --> 01:20:45,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

998
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

999
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:53,095
[SPEAKER_13]: On the vote of three to nothing to one, the motion is approved with the conditional factors.

1000
01:20:53,375 --> 01:21:04,963
[SPEAKER_13]: So to the petitioner, Mr. Collins, one way or the other, you're going to get what you need as a result of it being private public property, and if not, it's a private way and you'll have the authority to make those determinations yourself.

1001
01:21:05,004 --> 01:21:06,765
[SPEAKER_13]: But we want to operate under the

1002
01:21:07,285 --> 01:21:08,686
[SPEAKER_13]: correct regulatory standards.

1003
01:21:08,706 --> 01:21:15,309
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will let you know in the next day or two, but I don't think anything will hold up your project with what has just occurred with that fork.

1004
01:21:15,709 --> 01:21:16,890
[SPEAKER_16]: I really appreciate that.

1005
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:18,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for your time.

1006
01:21:18,831 --> 01:21:19,331
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1007
01:21:19,351 --> 01:21:19,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

1008
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:21,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Good luck with your project.

1009
01:21:22,042 --> 01:21:46,153
[SPEAKER_13]: thank you one last thing on this was sergeant rogers request obviously that one is more dependent on the fiber public so we can circle back to that yes once we find out okay thank you very much 2024-65 landlord parking permits business parking and clipper ship east lot the parklet area health care parking permit and fee price list for

1010
01:21:46,813 --> 01:21:47,474
[SPEAKER_13]: February 1st, 2025.

1011
01:21:48,274 --> 01:21:52,897
[SPEAKER_13]: I direct you to Jim Silva, the Special Project Director for the City of Medford.

1012
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:54,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Jim, the floor is yours.

1013
01:21:55,339 --> 01:21:56,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Chi.

1014
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,702
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot to unpack here, so I'm going to take each one of these.

1015
01:22:01,563 --> 01:22:10,048
[SPEAKER_10]: The landlord parking permits, back two years ago, the Traffic Commission approved a landlord parking permit program.

1016
01:22:10,529 --> 01:22:14,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, our system was not able to handle it at the time.

1017
01:22:15,772 --> 01:22:18,653
[SPEAKER_10]: So at this point, we are able to do that.

1018
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:24,514
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've had three requests in total over that time period from landlords.

1019
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:32,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of that would be a proof of unit ownership with a tax bill, a deed, or a water bill, plus their registration.

1020
01:22:33,935 --> 01:22:43,977
[SPEAKER_10]: So their registration to go into this system, their address would be in the system, and it would only be for that particular street where they own the property.

1021
01:22:44,722 --> 01:22:45,563
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to be fair.

1022
01:23:05,283 --> 01:23:10,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And it does allow, it doesn't allow them to park anywhere other than the street of ownership.

1023
01:23:11,809 --> 01:23:16,634
[SPEAKER_10]: In our case, we have Bowen, Burrick, and Benton Road, those streets for request to.

1024
01:23:16,654 --> 01:23:22,559
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe Alva had 1 request from a landlord recently as well.

1025
01:23:22,599 --> 01:23:23,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So, 4 in total.

1026
01:23:24,921 --> 01:23:26,123
[SPEAKER_10]: we can accommodate that.

1027
01:23:26,523 --> 01:23:38,215
[SPEAKER_10]: What we'd like to do is to offer that for next year, and if possible, start the sale of that during our annual renewal for resident parking.

1028
01:23:38,395 --> 01:23:42,159
[SPEAKER_10]: So on 12-1, make a landlord pass available for year 2025.

1029
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,883
[SPEAKER_10]: and again at $150 per location.

1030
01:23:48,284 --> 01:23:58,672
[SPEAKER_10]: If they have more than one location on a resident parking street, they would pay an additional $150, and their car would also be registered to be able to park on that street.

1031
01:23:59,713 --> 01:24:09,060
[SPEAKER_13]: A quick question for that one point is you have four known potential purchases or requests, but is there a restriction?

1032
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,101
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not capping it, right?

1033
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:12,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

1034
01:24:13,683 --> 01:24:18,627
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's surely been one property isn't being requested for each one of these folks.

1035
01:24:19,707 --> 01:24:22,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I ask a clarifying question?

1036
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:25,432
[SPEAKER_14]: These would go with a vehicle, right?

1037
01:24:26,779 --> 01:24:41,095
[SPEAKER_14]: So, if a landlord had 2 vehicles, they would have to pay twice if they wanted either 1, or if, say, they had 15 locations in the city, it would only be good at 1 vehicle.

1038
01:24:42,516 --> 01:24:46,858
[SPEAKER_14]: So they'd have to pay 150 for each of their 15 locations if they wanted it.

1039
01:24:47,438 --> 01:24:56,363
[SPEAKER_14]: And they would literally only be able to park at one of those locations at a time because it would actually only be for one vehicle unless they paid for more vehicles.

1040
01:24:56,963 --> 01:24:57,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1041
01:24:57,643 --> 01:25:01,205
[SPEAKER_10]: And that what most of our streets are not resident parking.

1042
01:25:01,325 --> 01:25:04,527
[SPEAKER_10]: So it doesn't really impact the city in total.

1043
01:25:05,127 --> 01:25:07,188
[SPEAKER_10]: But just in the resident parking street where

1044
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:12,034
[SPEAKER_10]: obviously, resident parking is a premium, spaces are a premium.

1045
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:17,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And this would not be a physical pass that could be handed out.

1046
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:22,445
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that's related to the actual vehicle itself.

1047
01:25:23,579 --> 01:25:27,203
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's some opportunity to do work, we have additional passes.

1048
01:25:27,263 --> 01:25:29,345
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a two-day and four-day pass.

1049
01:25:29,826 --> 01:25:44,302
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition, if the owner has somebody living in the house who participate in the resident parking program, they could use their visitor pass for two days, as well as most of these homes, more than 85% of the homes.

1050
01:25:45,823 --> 01:26:00,053
[SPEAKER_10]: have some form of off-street parking so we have some legal room to work with and again this is an opportunity to see how this program works but it's a great start and we'll see if the power enforcement tools work in conjunction with this.

1051
01:26:01,955 --> 01:26:08,759
[SPEAKER_13]: And to clarify one very important, I think will be an important point, if you have a resident apartment or if you live in the g-zone

1052
01:26:10,023 --> 01:26:13,764
[SPEAKER_13]: It's still restricted to that street that you have the property on.

1053
01:26:13,804 --> 01:26:16,065
[SPEAKER_13]: It does not give you entitlement to all the whole song.

1054
01:26:16,525 --> 01:26:17,125
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct.

1055
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:17,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1056
01:26:18,165 --> 01:26:18,405
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1057
01:26:18,505 --> 01:26:18,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

1058
01:26:19,665 --> 01:26:22,126
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the.

1059
01:26:22,246 --> 01:26:27,787
[SPEAKER_10]: 2nd, business parking and slippership East lot, which face at a time.

1060
01:26:28,127 --> 01:26:30,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Should we approve this 1 of the time so that.

1061
01:26:30,888 --> 01:26:31,908
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't get confused.

1062
01:26:33,069 --> 01:26:38,130
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm okay with that if unless there's an objection from commission, but given we could go right through.

1063
01:26:39,087 --> 01:26:58,493
[SPEAKER_13]: know that's fine I think just like to move approval on the landlord permit while it's all in my head I get it okay okay we do have a few people anyone in the public wish to comment on the landlord parking permit issue raise your hand and to the chat room

1064
01:27:00,331 --> 01:27:00,852
[SPEAKER_13]: up and down.

1065
01:27:00,872 --> 01:27:13,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Hearing none, on the motion by Commissioner Hunt to approve the landlord parking permits as presented by the Special Projects Director, seconded by Commissioner McGiven, roll call vote, please.

1066
01:27:14,784 --> 01:27:15,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

1067
01:27:16,285 --> 01:27:16,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1068
01:27:17,386 --> 01:27:18,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

1069
01:27:18,748 --> 01:27:18,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1070
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:20,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

1071
01:27:20,209 --> 01:27:20,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1072
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:25,914
[SPEAKER_13]: On the vote of three to nothing to one absent, the landlord parking permits as presented is approved.

1073
01:27:29,136 --> 01:27:32,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two, business parking in the clicker ship east lot.

1074
01:27:33,257 --> 01:27:37,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, the signs for business parking are there.

1075
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:02,045
[SPEAKER_10]: There are 601 participants in the last year for business permit parking.

1076
01:28:02,085 --> 01:28:02,946
[SPEAKER_10]: That was purchased in 2024.

1077
01:28:22,072 --> 01:28:28,376
[SPEAKER_10]: If it is identified and approved, then we will make those changes to the website that will allow people to navigate there.

1078
01:28:28,396 --> 01:28:30,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1079
01:28:31,498 --> 01:28:32,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Commissioners, any questions?

1080
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:35,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I show you which lot this is?

1081
01:28:36,001 --> 01:28:37,122
[SPEAKER_10]: It's where the parklet is.

1082
01:28:37,142 --> 01:28:39,484
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I can share it if you want.

1083
01:28:39,504 --> 01:28:40,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

1084
01:28:42,806 --> 01:28:45,328
[SPEAKER_14]: It came to my attention that the, like,

1085
01:28:46,597 --> 01:28:54,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Mister Silva said the there are signs in this lot already that say that business parking is allowed.

1086
01:28:55,481 --> 01:28:56,642
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would move approval.

1087
01:28:58,783 --> 01:29:01,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner Gibbons, any comments?

1088
01:29:01,364 --> 01:29:04,105
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to try to open this up public also see if there's any way I wish.

1089
01:29:04,825 --> 01:29:06,126
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I can second this.

1090
01:29:06,826 --> 01:29:07,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1091
01:29:07,486 --> 01:29:10,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone public want to comment or against?

1092
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:27,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, on the motion of Commissioner Hunt, approved with a seconded by Commissioner McGiven, a two, I'll offer to designate the Clippership East lot as business parking.

1093
01:29:27,917 --> 01:29:28,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Alba, roll call vote.

1094
01:29:28,938 --> 01:29:29,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

1095
01:29:30,378 --> 01:29:30,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1096
01:29:30,659 --> 01:29:31,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

1097
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:33,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1098
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

1099
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:34,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1100
01:29:35,581 --> 01:29:39,263
[SPEAKER_13]: On a vote of three to nothing to one, the motion is approved.

1101
01:29:41,116 --> 01:29:43,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Silva, healthcare parking permit.

1102
01:29:45,018 --> 01:29:51,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Enhancing the healthcare parking permit to allow healthcare permitted folks to park in business parking.

1103
01:29:53,362 --> 01:29:58,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Throughout the city, there are only four people who participate in the healthcare.

1104
01:29:59,524 --> 01:30:01,545
[SPEAKER_10]: permitting as of 2024.

1105
01:30:02,206 --> 01:30:17,576
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a number of folks in Medford Square specifically that do not have location to park without meter parking, and it becomes cumbersome for health care workers who are doing an eight-hour shift to actually utilize that.

1106
01:30:17,956 --> 01:30:27,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of our business parking, if we expand the size of it, it can accommodate those four folks who are participating, and maybe the program will grow a little bit more.

1107
01:30:28,808 --> 01:30:31,710
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're just trying to enhance the business parking.

1108
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:42,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Those locations that have business parking to include the healthcare workers to park there, they pay the same price as they would if they bought a business permit.

1109
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:44,541
[SPEAKER_10]: So the pricing is the same.

1110
01:30:47,964 --> 01:30:49,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Comments from commissioners?

1111
01:30:52,727 --> 01:30:53,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Makes sense.

1112
01:30:53,983 --> 01:30:55,504
[SPEAKER_14]: familiar with this issue.

1113
01:30:56,445 --> 01:31:02,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to be clear, this is intended not because you work in a clinic.

1114
01:31:02,431 --> 01:31:08,456
[SPEAKER_14]: These tend to be people who are being the day-long aid for somebody.

1115
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:15,214
[SPEAKER_14]: and that's when it's most likely to be an issue is that they can't leave to feed meters, et cetera.

1116
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:28,182
[SPEAKER_14]: And that we are actually, you see this, this Clippership lot in particular is a target location for where this happens because of all the senior and disabled housing adjacent to this lot, so.

1117
01:31:29,262 --> 01:31:30,223
[SPEAKER_13]: How much commission have we given?

1118
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:32,230
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I agree.

1119
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:36,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, anyone in the public wish to speak for or against this?

1120
01:31:37,052 --> 01:31:39,573
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're present, we'll just open it up to either one.

1121
01:31:39,593 --> 01:31:40,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Public comment?

1122
01:31:40,814 --> 01:31:45,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, seeing none, a motion?

1123
01:31:47,356 --> 01:31:48,037
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the commissioners?

1124
01:31:48,057 --> 01:31:49,717
[SPEAKER_18]: I already motioned, I'll motion if she didn't.

1125
01:31:52,223 --> 01:32:02,905
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give it to Commissioner McGiven on the motion of Commissioner McGiven to approve the health care parking permit expansion, seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

1126
01:32:02,925 --> 01:32:03,926
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have a roll call, please.

1127
01:32:04,266 --> 01:32:05,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

1128
01:32:05,726 --> 01:32:05,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1129
01:32:06,546 --> 01:32:07,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

1130
01:32:07,846 --> 01:32:08,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1131
01:32:08,547 --> 01:32:09,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

1132
01:32:09,527 --> 01:32:09,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1133
01:32:10,007 --> 01:32:15,028
[SPEAKER_13]: On the vote of three to nothing to one absent, the health care parking permit expansion is approved.

1134
01:32:15,688 --> 01:32:18,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Silva, fee price list for February 1st, 2025.

1135
01:32:20,002 --> 01:32:29,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we have been doing an evaluation for the last year or so, comparing our fee structure to the surrounding communities.

1136
01:32:30,346 --> 01:32:32,206
[SPEAKER_10]: We've looked at eight different communities.

1137
01:32:32,546 --> 01:32:35,227
[SPEAKER_10]: We see that some of our fees are much lower than others.

1138
01:32:35,827 --> 01:32:44,049
[SPEAKER_10]: We are trying to be a little bit more competitive in regard to paying for services, some of the enforcement tools, some of the enforcement itself.

1139
01:32:45,289 --> 01:32:48,270
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of these have not been raised for a number of years.

1140
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:53,091
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did send everybody a list of the fees.

1141
01:32:53,871 --> 01:32:56,552
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wondering if someone could share that on the screen.

1142
01:32:56,572 --> 01:32:57,572
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be very helpful.

1143
01:33:00,977 --> 01:33:03,080
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have it.

1144
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:05,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, were you just saying, did you email this to me?

1145
01:33:05,763 --> 01:33:06,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1146
01:33:06,183 --> 01:33:07,104
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Saturday.

1147
01:33:08,286 --> 01:33:08,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it from you?

1148
01:33:09,447 --> 01:33:09,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1149
01:33:09,928 --> 01:33:10,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1150
01:33:10,789 --> 01:33:11,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1151
01:33:13,312 --> 01:33:13,772
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is.

1152
01:33:15,237 --> 01:33:24,220
[SPEAKER_10]: I will mention off from the start, resident parking is $10 per vehicle for unlimited per household.

1153
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,381
[SPEAKER_10]: That went into effect on November of 1980, that price.

1154
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:31,562
[SPEAKER_10]: So for 44 years, it's been $10.

1155
01:33:32,242 --> 01:33:36,583
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it might be time to look at this and review some of these price fees.

1156
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:42,845
[SPEAKER_10]: The other issue is within the household, currently it's unlimited.

1157
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:48,089
[SPEAKER_10]: We have run into situations where some streets are inundated.

1158
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:56,016
[SPEAKER_10]: People may have 10 cars, and that sometimes is not a healthy sort of situation.

1159
01:33:56,636 --> 01:34:03,483
[SPEAKER_10]: So by limiting the cars and actually tiering the resident parking for the first two, it's 20 per car.

1160
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:11,653
[SPEAKER_10]: and the third car is 30, fourth car is 40, and the fifth is fifth and final car that can be in a household.

1161
01:34:11,673 --> 01:34:20,618
[SPEAKER_10]: This gives people an opportunity to talk about limiting, if this is too much, if this is too little, et cetera, but it's a good opportunity.

1162
01:34:20,658 --> 01:34:25,720
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'd like to have this possibly approved by February 1st of next year.

1163
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:32,723
[SPEAKER_10]: So as I said earlier about the renewal process, which is in December, December 1st to January 1st,

1164
01:34:34,832 --> 01:34:38,434
[SPEAKER_10]: the folks will not be impacted by any price change this year.

1165
01:34:38,454 --> 01:34:46,339
[SPEAKER_10]: So for a whole year, people have paid their $10 and they're good until beginning of 2026 if these fees were approved.

1166
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:54,184
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing is our visitor pass program is currently free if you purchase resident parking.

1167
01:34:54,804 --> 01:34:58,107
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't have a resident parking, it's $10 per pass.

1168
01:34:58,147 --> 01:34:59,888
[SPEAKER_10]: So that price already exists.

1169
01:35:00,288 --> 01:35:03,030
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just gonna charge the visitor pass

1170
01:35:05,012 --> 01:35:05,852
[SPEAKER_10]: $10 per pass.

1171
01:35:06,433 --> 01:35:07,373
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a limit of two.

1172
01:35:08,054 --> 01:35:09,455
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that will be included.

1173
01:35:09,475 --> 01:35:14,138
[SPEAKER_10]: You purchased your resident parking, you'll also have to purchase your visitor pass.

1174
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:17,321
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the enhancement for 2025, again, February of 2025.

1175
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:18,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Business parking is currently $100.

1176
01:35:18,842 --> 01:35:21,363
[SPEAKER_10]: So people will renew their share for $100.

1177
01:35:21,444 --> 01:35:22,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Next year, we'd like to make it 125.

1178
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:31,432
[SPEAKER_10]: The home health services, again, is 100.

1179
01:35:31,672 --> 01:35:36,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Naturally, the business parking went up to 125 per year.

1180
01:35:37,616 --> 01:35:38,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Postal service.

1181
01:35:39,017 --> 01:35:43,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, we have 42 postal employees that participate in our program.

1182
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,202
[SPEAKER_10]: We also provide some parking locations.

1183
01:35:46,702 --> 01:35:53,587
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking to potentially have them pay $30 per year for next year as well.

1184
01:35:54,956 --> 01:35:56,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Resident commuter pass.

1185
01:35:56,217 --> 01:35:58,801
[SPEAKER_10]: There are two commuter parking lots in Medford.

1186
01:35:58,881 --> 01:36:01,465
[SPEAKER_10]: One is in West Medford and one is behind City Hall.

1187
01:36:02,406 --> 01:36:03,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently it's $100 per calendar year.

1188
01:36:03,368 --> 01:36:05,090
[SPEAKER_10]: We would like to go up to $125 per calendar year.

1189
01:36:09,817 --> 01:36:12,779
[SPEAKER_10]: The senior folks, senior resident parking is free.

1190
01:36:12,799 --> 01:36:14,240
[SPEAKER_10]: We would like to keep it free.

1191
01:36:15,001 --> 01:36:16,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Senior visitor pass is free.

1192
01:36:16,742 --> 01:36:17,783
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd like to keep it free.

1193
01:36:18,603 --> 01:36:28,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Senior meter and kiosk parking that allows people 65 and older to park in any municipal lot for $25 per year, we'd like to keep it the same.

1194
01:36:29,931 --> 01:36:30,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Realtor fee.

1195
01:36:30,912 --> 01:36:32,213
[SPEAKER_10]: There was one realtor.

1196
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:33,474
[SPEAKER_10]: We currently have zero.

1197
01:36:33,814 --> 01:36:37,977
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd like to raise that to $150 per calendar year to match the landlord fee.

1198
01:36:39,556 --> 01:36:42,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving day pass, 4 day pass and 2 day pass.

1199
01:36:42,821 --> 01:36:45,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently they're in the G zone, which is our zone parking.

1200
01:36:46,427 --> 01:36:51,555
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd like to see if we can make that citywide for resident parking streets.

1201
01:36:53,048 --> 01:36:55,410
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been very popular with the moving day pass.

1202
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:58,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Generally you'll have those being purchased in September.

1203
01:36:58,552 --> 01:36:59,972
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a pilot program.

1204
01:37:00,433 --> 01:37:02,314
[SPEAKER_10]: So we missed the June move out date.

1205
01:37:02,754 --> 01:37:06,617
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're assuming that we had 50 people participate in the gene zone this year.

1206
01:37:06,777 --> 01:37:09,819
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is a popular moving program.

1207
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:16,803
[SPEAKER_10]: And it allows people to have, again, if you're moving into your location, you at least have that space in front of your house for moving trucks.

1208
01:37:17,578 --> 01:37:26,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Four-day pass, two-day pass is probably we're helping landlords that potentially didn't want to participate in the landlord program, but they could buy these two passes.

1209
01:37:26,421 --> 01:37:35,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, nobody has bought either one of them, but I think we could look at sort of promoting this a little bit better, and the prices will basically stay the same.

1210
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:38,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And the last one is a new resident pass.

1211
01:37:39,387 --> 01:37:47,375
[SPEAKER_10]: We have currently been offering a two week pass for $10, which will be applied to their resident parking.

1212
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:49,919
[SPEAKER_10]: going forward.

1213
01:37:50,379 --> 01:37:54,161
[SPEAKER_10]: This program is only available for Massachusetts registered vehicles.

1214
01:37:54,641 --> 01:37:58,182
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you move from Melrose to Medford, you can participate in this.

1215
01:37:58,222 --> 01:38:06,606
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you come from Virginia, you have to on the day of move into Massachusetts, you have to have your updated registration.

1216
01:38:07,366 --> 01:38:10,087
[SPEAKER_10]: So it keeps it within line of what we currently do.

1217
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:19,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions?

1218
01:38:20,534 --> 01:38:26,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I like that they would take effect in so that people renewing now.

1219
01:38:27,722 --> 01:38:32,503
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll renew it the old rates, and then they take effect in February.

1220
01:38:33,183 --> 01:38:38,504
[SPEAKER_14]: That would say if somebody hasn't renewed by February, then they don't use their pass very often.

1221
01:38:39,104 --> 01:38:47,146
[SPEAKER_14]: But then if they move in over the course of the coming year, it's they're impacted by the new rates or they get a new car during the course of the new year.

1222
01:38:47,726 --> 01:38:48,566
[SPEAKER_14]: So I like that.

1223
01:38:50,347 --> 01:38:57,548
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be happy to see the resident parking passes more expensive than this, but it's a start.

1224
01:39:02,532 --> 01:39:04,254
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are my thoughts.

1225
01:39:04,414 --> 01:39:05,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner McGinn, a comment?

1226
01:39:06,696 --> 01:39:20,288
[SPEAKER_18]: No, just that I know Jim has put a lot of work into this and you know Alicia I know and myself at times have contributed to this effort in the working group so I'm in support of this and I

1227
01:39:22,515 --> 01:39:23,476
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we'd move approval.

1228
01:39:23,496 --> 01:39:24,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1229
01:39:25,858 --> 01:39:27,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Questions or comments from the public?

1230
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:28,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone want to raise their hand?

1231
01:39:29,841 --> 01:39:30,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Chat, please?

1232
01:39:33,284 --> 01:39:51,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, on the motion of Commissioner McGiven, seconded by Commissioner Hunt for the approval of the fee price list structure for February of 2025 as presented by Mr. Jim Silva, Alvaro Calvo.

1233
01:39:52,124 --> 01:39:53,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1234
01:39:53,925 --> 01:39:54,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1235
01:39:54,185 --> 01:39:55,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

1236
01:39:56,106 --> 01:39:56,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1237
01:39:56,826 --> 01:39:57,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

1238
01:39:58,166 --> 01:39:58,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1239
01:39:58,987 --> 01:40:04,029
[SPEAKER_13]: On the vote of three to nothing, to one, the fee structure is approved.

1240
01:40:05,570 --> 01:40:07,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's everything within the petition.

1241
01:40:08,751 --> 01:40:10,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else, Jim, that we missed?

1242
01:40:10,872 --> 01:40:20,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make mention that two of these are effective for purchase on 12-1, the landlord pass and the resident pass, just those two.

1243
01:40:21,979 --> 01:40:28,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief, can I ask you, on the moving pass, is that gonna come with no parking signs?

1244
01:40:28,884 --> 01:40:32,706
[SPEAKER_10]: They do, they currently come with two no parking signs for that specific date.

1245
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:42,193
[SPEAKER_10]: So folks come into the parking department, and they request that date, they pay, and the dates are written into that, and then there are two.

1246
01:40:43,242 --> 01:40:45,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Jim, currently it's only the G-Zone, correct?

1247
01:40:46,063 --> 01:40:46,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1248
01:40:46,503 --> 01:40:50,825
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd like to move it city-wide into resident parking streets.

1249
01:40:51,225 --> 01:40:58,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, if you don't have resident parking, maybe the program could work for folks as well if they need to do that in front of their house.

1250
01:40:58,388 --> 01:41:05,391
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just think it's a good place to start to see how it works because it is limited parking in resident parking streets.

1251
01:41:06,732 --> 01:41:09,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Because constantly I'm posting outside of the G-Zone,

1252
01:41:11,447 --> 01:41:13,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I think those are homemade signs.

1253
01:41:13,589 --> 01:41:14,849
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to be honest with you.

1254
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:17,551
[SPEAKER_10]: We're only issuing them within the G zone.

1255
01:41:18,451 --> 01:41:19,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, excellent.

1256
01:41:20,593 --> 01:41:21,853
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, any other questions?

1257
01:41:23,815 --> 01:41:24,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent job.

1258
01:41:24,835 --> 01:41:26,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the presentation.

1259
01:41:26,056 --> 01:41:33,160
[SPEAKER_13]: 2024-66 stop sign on Whittemore Street at Edward Street.

1260
01:41:35,341 --> 01:41:36,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this a police department petition?

1261
01:41:39,167 --> 01:41:41,548
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe this was a complaint, Chief.

1262
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:46,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I did go up there, and I did make a mistake with Alba.

1263
01:41:46,729 --> 01:41:52,431
[SPEAKER_11]: On Edward Street, Whittemore is the only street entering Edward Street.

1264
01:41:52,931 --> 01:41:54,152
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no stop sign.

1265
01:41:54,192 --> 01:41:56,452
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a one-way do not enter sign.

1266
01:41:57,513 --> 01:42:02,314
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the streets on Edward Street exit Edward Street, so there are no stop signs.

1267
01:42:05,935 --> 01:42:16,800
[SPEAKER_13]: The commissioners hear that out there that this is presented from a complaint to the police department and the traffic commission, and it's with regard to Whittemore Street, which filters out onto Edward Street.

1268
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,680
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no stop sign present.

1269
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:22,202
[SPEAKER_13]: There has not been one in the past that we have any record of.

1270
01:42:23,122 --> 01:42:33,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Initially, someone thought it might have been missing, and the complaint is listing that, you know, speeding, wrong-way drivers, et cetera,

1271
01:42:35,727 --> 01:42:38,549
[SPEAKER_13]: and they would like not only enforcement, but a stop sign.

1272
01:42:39,669 --> 01:42:40,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Director Blake?

1273
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:46,374
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, this one, unlike the other one on Central Ave, this is more like the Fulbright if it's a public way, Fulbright.

1274
01:42:46,654 --> 01:42:51,897
[SPEAKER_19]: So this just clarifies that the minor street must stop before entering the more major street of Edwards.

1275
01:42:52,518 --> 01:42:55,219
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm in support of recommending approval to this.

1276
01:43:02,284 --> 01:43:02,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1277
01:43:06,457 --> 01:43:09,818
[SPEAKER_14]: If it makes sense, it's in line with requirements.

1278
01:43:09,898 --> 01:43:14,880
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a feeling that people need to be told to stop before turning.

1279
01:43:19,262 --> 01:43:24,645
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my sigh for people who just don't notice that maybe you should stop and look.

1280
01:43:26,038 --> 01:43:31,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, to that point, we obviously can't put stop signs on every street, right?

1281
01:43:31,301 --> 01:43:44,347
[SPEAKER_13]: And but this one does accompany a number of complaints about wrong way drivers, which I don't know what the stop sign is going to do about that, but in some speeding, it might help to slow down the issues in that area.

1282
01:43:44,387 --> 01:43:44,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

1283
01:43:45,579 --> 01:43:51,702
[SPEAKER_13]: but I do agree, there's some basic rules of the road that people have to adhere to.

1284
01:43:51,942 --> 01:43:53,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I know they were tested on it.

1285
01:43:54,004 --> 01:43:54,924
[SPEAKER_18]: Was there a move in there?

1286
01:43:54,944 --> 01:43:56,605
[SPEAKER_14]: I move approval.

1287
01:43:57,005 --> 01:43:57,626
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, second.

1288
01:43:58,206 --> 01:43:59,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I will open it up to public.

1289
01:44:00,027 --> 01:44:01,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions, concerns, comments?

1290
01:44:03,209 --> 01:44:09,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, on the motion of Commissioner Hunt, seconded by Commissioner McGiven.

1291
01:44:09,512 --> 01:44:11,953
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have a roll call, please.

1292
01:44:12,674 --> 01:44:13,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

1293
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:14,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1294
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:16,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

1295
01:44:16,770 --> 01:44:17,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1296
01:44:17,811 --> 01:44:18,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Chief Buckley?

1297
01:44:18,571 --> 01:44:24,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, on a vote of three to nothing to one absent, the stop sign has been approved.

1298
01:44:24,152 --> 01:44:33,934
[SPEAKER_13]: 2024-67, no turn on red on Locust Street to Riverside Ave, and that would be Commissioner Todd Blake to present.

1299
01:44:33,954 --> 01:44:36,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Alicia, can you pull that up for him?

1300
01:44:36,174 --> 01:44:38,995
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll be heading on Locust to Riverside.

1301
01:44:42,049 --> 01:44:42,989
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so thank you all.

1302
01:44:43,249 --> 01:44:46,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, this is to help pedestrian safety.

1303
01:44:46,611 --> 01:44:58,355
[SPEAKER_19]: So that right turn lane that you see heading up on the screen, when a pedestrian pushes the button to cross and gets the walk signal, that right turn currently could turn on red.

1304
01:44:58,995 --> 01:45:02,837
[SPEAKER_19]: And they kind of, they're so concerned with the vehicles, they're not paying attention to the pedestrians.

1305
01:45:02,897 --> 01:45:09,019
[SPEAKER_19]: So by having no turn on red, it would help pedestrian safety and it wouldn't impact the vehicles too much because

1306
01:45:09,899 --> 01:45:37,486
[SPEAKER_19]: that right turn gets a green during the locus street green as well as during the riverside left turn green it overlaps so that that right turn gets double the amount of green that the left turn does on locus street even if we restrict the no turner red so um that's the intent of this um request okay um the commission does have any questions of director blake

1307
01:45:40,897 --> 01:45:42,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you say there was an incident here?

1308
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:51,907
[SPEAKER_19]: No, but I've experienced it myself and I've seen others have issues with this as a bus stop on a bus shelter on that south side.

1309
01:45:52,367 --> 01:45:59,574
[SPEAKER_19]: So when people press the button across to get to that bus, the vehicles turning right just don't pay attention to any pedestrians at all.

1310
01:45:59,614 --> 01:46:03,057
[SPEAKER_19]: They're too concerned with the gap in traffic on Riverside.

1311
01:46:03,954 --> 01:46:14,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we see, I know in the region, Cambridge has had a couple of these right turns that pedestrians get hit because the turns allowed on the right hand.

1312
01:46:14,759 --> 01:46:17,440
[SPEAKER_18]: We've talked about this in a number of other spots in the city.

1313
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:19,561
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm in favor of making these restrictions.

1314
01:46:22,082 --> 01:46:23,042
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have a motion to approve this.

1315
01:46:23,903 --> 01:46:25,343
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, second.

1316
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:29,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Public comment, anybody here wishing to speak for or against?

1317
01:46:32,968 --> 01:46:42,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, on the motion of Commissioner McGibbon, seconded by Commissioner Hunt, to approve the no turn on red on Locust Street to Riverside Ave, petition 2024-67.

1318
01:46:42,732 --> 01:46:44,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Alvaro, roll call vote, please.

1319
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:46,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1320
01:46:47,093 --> 01:46:47,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1321
01:46:47,353 --> 01:46:48,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

1322
01:46:49,094 --> 01:46:49,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1323
01:46:49,994 --> 01:46:50,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

1324
01:46:50,914 --> 01:46:51,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1325
01:46:51,295 --> 01:46:54,736
[SPEAKER_13]: On the vote of three to nothing to one absent, the motion is approved.

1326
01:47:01,157 --> 01:47:07,362
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have, I know Peggy is present here this evening, 87 Monument Street.

1327
01:47:09,044 --> 01:47:09,945
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a table.

1328
01:47:09,965 --> 01:47:13,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just look this up for one second.

1329
01:47:13,348 --> 01:47:13,368
[SPEAKER_13]: 2024-51.

1330
01:47:20,668 --> 01:47:24,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is for the commissioners as to whether or not we would like to take a table.

1331
01:47:24,311 --> 01:47:25,372
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a request from Ms.

1332
01:47:25,732 --> 01:47:35,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Peggy Rose, 87 Monument Street, for no parking here to corner signs on Harvard Ave at Monument Street, northeast and southeast corners.

1333
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,022
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was tabled.

1334
01:47:37,762 --> 01:47:38,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we know why?

1335
01:47:38,623 --> 01:47:40,845
[SPEAKER_13]: From last month because she was not at the meeting.

1336
01:47:41,025 --> 01:47:45,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so it was tabled from last night because she was unable to make the meeting, but she is present this evening.

1337
01:47:45,689 --> 01:47:48,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Do the commissioners want to take up a tabled item this evening?

1338
01:47:49,492 --> 01:47:49,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1339
01:47:50,236 --> 01:47:51,998
[SPEAKER_14]: He has sat through this entire meeting.

1340
01:47:52,338 --> 01:47:53,399
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to pick it up.

1341
01:47:53,499 --> 01:47:58,304
[SPEAKER_13]: I was hoping you were going to say that because it would be awfully awkward for me to explain to her that we were not going to.

1342
01:47:59,625 --> 01:48:00,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that require a motion?

1343
01:48:00,806 --> 01:48:01,447
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do it real quick.

1344
01:48:01,507 --> 01:48:04,310
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll roll call vote to take table item 2024-51 up for debate.

1345
01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:06,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner McGibbon?

1346
01:48:10,128 --> 01:48:11,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1347
01:48:12,008 --> 01:48:12,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1348
01:48:12,689 --> 01:48:13,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley.

1349
01:48:13,349 --> 01:48:14,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes on three, nothing to one.

1350
01:48:14,849 --> 01:48:15,749
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion is approved.

1351
01:48:15,789 --> 01:48:18,330
[SPEAKER_13]: We will take up item 2024-51.

1352
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:22,451
[SPEAKER_13]: I've already read it, 87 Monument Street, no parking, gate to corner.

1353
01:48:23,231 --> 01:48:24,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1354
01:48:24,591 --> 01:48:27,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Rose, I'm going to ask you to unmute yourself and just present the petition.

1355
01:48:29,693 --> 01:48:30,373
[SPEAKER_13]: So busy.

1356
01:48:30,733 --> 01:48:32,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, and thank you for your patience.

1357
01:48:32,793 --> 01:48:33,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1358
01:48:33,154 --> 01:48:38,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually not a patient person, as Alvin knows from my emails that I sent earlier this evening.

1359
01:48:39,939 --> 01:48:42,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I would just give it a try.

1360
01:48:42,581 --> 01:48:43,922
[SPEAKER_05]: You can always push yourself.

1361
01:48:43,962 --> 01:48:45,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So here I am, still at the end.

1362
01:48:47,925 --> 01:48:52,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So Harvard Ave, I know you guys have been working hard on Harvard Ave at the speed tables.

1363
01:48:52,929 --> 01:48:57,893
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no parking here to corner signs at several of the other streets, like Sharon and Jerome.

1364
01:48:58,833 --> 01:49:02,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need them at Monument Street for kind of the same reasons.

1365
01:49:03,577 --> 01:49:06,079
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need them on the far side, and I think, actually,

1366
01:49:07,743 --> 01:49:10,946
[SPEAKER_05]: The no parking here at a corner on the far side.

1367
01:49:10,966 --> 01:49:15,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Of monument street is actually super confusing and weird because you can't park.

1368
01:49:15,669 --> 01:49:17,251
[SPEAKER_05]: No 1 parks on the far side.

1369
01:49:17,271 --> 01:49:20,513
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm just asking for them on the near side.

1370
01:49:23,375 --> 01:49:28,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of where you see the back end of that red car, which, you know, it's practically 20 feet.

1371
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a big deal, but over here.

1372
01:49:30,201 --> 01:49:30,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1373
01:49:30,921 --> 01:49:31,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So that.

1374
01:49:32,147 --> 01:49:36,269
[SPEAKER_05]: That side that we're looking at, it's sometimes people park there, but not too often.

1375
01:49:36,829 --> 01:49:38,030
[SPEAKER_05]: But there should be a sign there.

1376
01:49:38,050 --> 01:49:53,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the other corner, people, huge vans, vans with ladders on top, like they park right literally to the curb cut thing, the wheelchair ramp there.

1377
01:49:53,297 --> 01:49:58,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's absolutely impossible to get onto Harvard Ave with any degree of safety.

1378
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:02,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1379
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:05,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that was presented.

1380
01:50:05,661 --> 01:50:10,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner's comments, and then I'm going to also ask Director Blake for a comment on this.

1381
01:50:12,602 --> 01:50:12,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1382
01:50:17,523 --> 01:50:20,903
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to make sure that we're looking at the right things.

1383
01:50:21,083 --> 01:50:23,544
[SPEAKER_14]: I realize I've been controlling the screen here.

1384
01:50:23,564 --> 01:50:30,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this here, like we're talking about in- That's the really desperate one where people park

1385
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,901
[SPEAKER_05]: really close to the corner and it's very, very hard.

1386
01:50:34,341 --> 01:50:40,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And then across the way behind the red car there, just to keep that clear as well.

1387
01:50:41,742 --> 01:50:45,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Were there two locations or those are the two locations you're talking about?

1388
01:50:45,063 --> 01:50:46,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the two that I want.

1389
01:50:46,443 --> 01:50:46,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1390
01:50:46,683 --> 01:50:52,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner McGibbon, any comments?

1391
01:50:52,764 --> 01:50:54,485
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just doing some measurements right now.

1392
01:50:58,403 --> 01:51:24,588
[SPEAKER_18]: do you know really besides my other the comments that i had before if we're just talking about corners and no parking at the corners i'm not sure i want to sign it if it's just um the 20-foot rule so how do we get them i mean this is the problem is that it's this catch 22 when we put up the signs people think

1393
01:51:25,112 --> 01:51:30,899
[SPEAKER_14]: that, oh, here I'm not allowed to, but over there there's no sign, so I must be allowed to.

1394
01:51:31,721 --> 01:51:38,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas if we don't put up the signs, many people don't know that there's a rule that you can't park within 20 feet of the corner.

1395
01:51:39,662 --> 01:51:43,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, partly, honestly, it's like a public education thing.

1396
01:51:44,344 --> 01:51:52,729
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't affect me as much, but at Boston Ave, at Holton, which is the other way to get out of my house, it's like ridiculous.

1397
01:51:52,769 --> 01:51:58,392
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a red girl that parks, like, literally past the curb, you know?

1398
01:51:59,192 --> 01:52:08,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And my daughter and I have joked, like, we should just start a campaign of, like, putting fake tickets on these cars that say, does this corner make my butt look big?

1399
01:52:08,977 --> 01:52:12,320
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, it's just, it's ridiculous.

1400
01:52:12,541 --> 01:52:19,267
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it is absolute nonsense to park your car that way for like a hundred reasons.

1401
01:52:19,487 --> 01:52:20,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's against the law.

1402
01:52:20,889 --> 01:52:23,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, what can we do?

1403
01:52:23,091 --> 01:52:29,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I totally agree, but I can't get out like either way.

1404
01:52:29,497 --> 01:52:31,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get out of my neighborhood.

1405
01:52:32,464 --> 01:52:41,312
[SPEAKER_19]: So as the residents saying, we did restrict parking and sign it at at least two other locations, I think Jerome and Sharon.

1406
01:52:42,272 --> 01:52:43,914
[SPEAKER_19]: So this would be consistent.

1407
01:52:44,034 --> 01:52:48,878
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe if memory serves me in those locations, we did do more than the 20.

1408
01:52:48,918 --> 01:52:51,060
[SPEAKER_19]: I think she did 30 in each case.

1409
01:52:52,621 --> 01:52:58,807
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe we should consider 30 feet, just like those other two.

1410
01:53:01,583 --> 01:53:17,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly to make it consistent just along that strip, because it's people parking for the train, you know, and it's, well, it's commercial vehicles or should be, you know, vans with ladders, you know.

1411
01:53:18,856 --> 01:53:26,722
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've had some success, right, Sergeant, Todd, so far with those current restrictions we've had in place on the other, so all of them, so.

1412
01:53:27,443 --> 01:53:28,944
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I don't want to keep her here.

1413
01:53:29,224 --> 01:53:30,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I like it painted.

1414
01:53:30,511 --> 01:53:34,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I didn't do the stuff until he realized, oh, I can't park here.

1415
01:53:34,716 --> 01:53:37,819
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's well, however, I was in more of a major street.

1416
01:53:37,839 --> 01:53:40,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the street that we should to reinforce.

1417
01:53:40,982 --> 01:53:41,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1418
01:53:44,426 --> 01:53:51,194
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, based on our modification tonight, can you hear the traffic sergeant is suggested that he really would like it painted.

1419
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:55,001
[SPEAKER_13]: As well assigned, but like the curb.

1420
01:53:55,501 --> 01:54:00,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, no, there's well, I mean, that's my I'm sorry, not not not the curb, the hatch mark.

1421
01:54:00,524 --> 01:54:03,265
[SPEAKER_13]: So we put a cross market.

1422
01:54:03,285 --> 01:54:04,425
[SPEAKER_13]: So you look on the ground.

1423
01:54:04,445 --> 01:54:05,906
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't see that.

1424
01:54:06,106 --> 01:54:07,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, that would be heavenly because.

1425
01:54:08,655 --> 01:54:10,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's a really tough street.

1426
01:54:10,155 --> 01:54:26,758
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, people go, as you know, because you're trying to fix it, people go so fast and people coming off the river are going, they're not driving in their lane, you know, because they don't want to hit the parked car, but then, like, people are stopping and letting each other go by.

1427
01:54:28,338 --> 01:54:37,560
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough, it's tough, but especially under that tree on the southeast corner, you know, under that tree,

1428
01:54:39,645 --> 01:54:43,467
[SPEAKER_05]: those hatch marks would be really, really important, really improve safety.

1429
01:54:43,547 --> 01:54:47,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people fly from the river, they're going so fast.

1430
01:54:47,388 --> 01:54:51,790
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going so fast from Boston Ave because they don't have a chance to get going, you know?

1431
01:54:56,712 --> 01:54:57,332
[SPEAKER_13]: What are your thoughts?

1432
01:54:58,335 --> 01:55:02,838
[SPEAKER_18]: Charlie said the stretch has 30 foot off corner, no parking signs.

1433
01:55:03,458 --> 01:55:04,399
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe so.

1434
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:07,181
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe that's what we proved in the past.

1435
01:55:07,681 --> 01:55:08,261
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it is.

1436
01:55:10,883 --> 01:55:18,048
[SPEAKER_19]: And if that tree is an issue itself, we could consider trimming the bottom of that as well.

1437
01:55:18,648 --> 01:55:20,209
[SPEAKER_19]: If that impacts sightline.

1438
01:55:20,869 --> 01:55:22,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure it does.

1439
01:55:22,230 --> 01:55:23,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually never.

1440
01:55:24,232 --> 01:55:24,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1441
01:55:24,532 --> 01:55:25,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't thought about that.

1442
01:55:26,013 --> 01:55:29,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, whatever is standard would be great.

1443
01:55:30,557 --> 01:55:30,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

1444
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:37,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't think that's so much the issue.

1445
01:55:41,465 --> 01:55:42,486
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm okay with it.

1446
01:55:43,467 --> 01:55:45,068
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the question is just sort of how

1447
01:55:56,612 --> 01:55:58,874
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll second that if that motion is for 30 feet.

1448
01:55:58,894 --> 01:55:59,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

1449
01:56:01,176 --> 01:56:07,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, on the motion of permission to hunt, I just want to go on my paperwork, sorry.

1450
01:56:13,225 --> 01:56:30,943
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Commissioner Hunt to approve 2024-51 for no parking signs here to corner 30 feet on Harvard Ave at Monument Street, northeast and southeast corners, seconded by Commissioner McGiven.

1451
01:56:34,066 --> 01:56:35,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner McGiven?

1452
01:56:35,727 --> 01:56:36,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, indeed.

1453
01:56:36,882 --> 01:56:37,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Hunt?

1454
01:56:37,623 --> 01:56:38,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1455
01:56:39,204 --> 01:56:39,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief Buckley?

1456
01:56:39,984 --> 01:56:40,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1457
01:56:40,585 --> 01:56:44,348
[SPEAKER_13]: On the vote of three to nothing, to one absent, the motion is approved.

1458
01:56:45,488 --> 01:56:46,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1459
01:56:46,209 --> 01:56:53,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Rose, thank you for your patience in sitting through our lovely Traffic Commission meeting that got started off with such a bang, but I think we finished up well for you then.

1460
01:56:53,774 --> 01:56:54,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1461
01:56:54,455 --> 01:56:55,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned a lot.

1462
01:56:55,776 --> 01:56:57,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate your work.

1463
01:56:57,477 --> 01:56:58,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks very, very much.

1464
01:56:58,398 --> 01:56:59,078
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.

1465
01:56:59,098 --> 01:56:59,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good night.

1466
01:57:02,231 --> 01:57:06,674
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is a pretty good agenda, plus as Todd puts out, we got one off the table.

1467
01:57:06,694 --> 01:57:12,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Commissioner Brzezinski will be proud of us that we took the tabled item off and dealt with it.

1468
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:15,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we will do better next time.

1469
01:57:15,701 --> 01:57:23,947
[SPEAKER_13]: I point that out always, but I have no idea what happened to our email this evening, but we adapted and we overcame and we got the meeting done.

1470
01:57:24,888 --> 01:57:26,129
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not quite 7 o'clock.

1471
01:57:27,111 --> 01:57:28,314
[SPEAKER_13]: We can talk about when we need supper.

1472
01:57:29,136 --> 01:57:30,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to adjourn.

1473
01:57:30,859 --> 01:57:30,839
7.40.

1474
01:57:30,879 --> 01:57:32,302
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion of commission, 7.40.

1475
01:57:32,342 --> 01:57:36,992
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion of commission we're given to adjourn, seconded by Commissioner Hunt.

1476
01:57:38,035 --> 01:57:39,638
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1477
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:40,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1478
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:40,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1479
01:57:41,482 --> 01:57:42,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good night, everyone.

1480
01:57:42,645 --> 01:57:43,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Jim.

1481
01:57:43,326 --> 01:57:43,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

1482
01:57:43,727 --> 01:57:44,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1483
01:57:44,609 --> 01:57:45,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1484
01:57:45,230 --> 01:57:45,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Alba.
