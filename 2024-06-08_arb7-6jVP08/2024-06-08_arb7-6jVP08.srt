1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:00,989
[SPEAKER_08]: table on my left.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:11,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had the good fortune of working over the last few months with one of my favorite local agencies, the Mystic River Watershed Association.

3
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:26,600
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've supported a number of recent community center outreach programs, and they are one of the busiest organizations in the area whose mission is based in conservation, recreation, and restoration of our local waterways.

4
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:49,046
[SPEAKER_08]: So tonight, we have a few of their leaders here to talk about the special work they have planned for the summer, and in particular, about a forward-looking initiative called the Mystic Lakes Pathway Improvement Project that they're hoping to bring to a stretch of the river, just a stone's throw away from where we sit.

5
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:56,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Our guests for this portion of the evening's program are friends, and they certainly have a great story to tell.

6
00:00:57,373 --> 00:01:05,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me first reintroduce to you the executive director of MIRA, Mystic River Watershed Association.

7
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:06,983
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my friend Patrick Herron.

8
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:15,711
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been at the helm of the agency since September of 2016, and he leads the overall vision of the organization.

9
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:19,395
[SPEAKER_08]: He manages the finances and the board of directors, and we know what that's like.

10
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:27,643
[SPEAKER_08]: He joined MIRA as the Water Quality Monitoring Director in 2009 and became Deputy Director in 2014.

11
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:40,778
[SPEAKER_08]: During his tenure with the organization, Patrick has worked with the staff to initiate many new programs for the association, including water chestnut or invasive species removal,

12
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:47,261
[SPEAKER_08]: River herring monitoring, that's really a key clue to the health of the river.

13
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:50,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Mystic Greenways and waterfront restoration.

14
00:01:51,243 --> 00:02:01,287
[SPEAKER_08]: During his time at the association, he has written and managed many of the grants that have underpinned this work and established collaborations across the watershed.

15
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,268
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more to say, but I'll leave it right there.

16
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:09,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Suffice it to say that he's a busy man running a very important organization.

17
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:13,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Joining Patrick at the table is Carl Alexander.

18
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:28,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Carl is charged with leading all aspects of the aforementioned Mystic Greenways program, working alongside a dynamic, collaborative team on the community-led design of park and shared-use path projects along the watershed.

19
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:39,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Most recently, Carl served as an urban planning and design consultant for open space and greenways, mobility and placemaking projects in the greater Boston area.

20
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:50,721
[SPEAKER_08]: A few of the highlights of which include the Mary Ellen Welch Greenway in East Boston, the Airwife Linear Park in Cambridge, and the Neighborways Program in Somerville.

21
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,143
[SPEAKER_08]: He has a BA in politics from Bates.

22
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Bates is a good school up there in Maine.

23
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:56,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Up there in Maine.

24
00:02:56,565 --> 00:03:04,070
[SPEAKER_08]: and an MS in urban planning and community development from down here at UMass Boston School for the Environment, resident of East Somerville.

25
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,032
[SPEAKER_08]: In his spare time, he enjoys cooking, gardening, and hiking.

26
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:08,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know this about you, okay.

27
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:24,004
[SPEAKER_08]: So as is my custom in beginning these evenings we share, I would like to offer a bit of verse to get us thinking about the themes of equity, history, accessibility that we'll be talking about for the next little while.

28
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:25,505
[SPEAKER_08]: This piece is called

29
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,222
[SPEAKER_08]: A river runs through it.

30
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:33,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is a place of legacy.

31
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:36,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Monuments of wood and bronze and stone.

32
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Stories we tell and make our own.

33
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:41,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Colonial towns that stand the test of time.

34
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Old graveyards that reckon our lost prime.

35
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Thoughts that bring a poet to a rhyme.

36
00:03:47,922 --> 00:03:49,203
[SPEAKER_08]: And a river runs through it.

37
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:51,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is a place of history.

38
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:54,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Heroes that fought in foreign wars.

39
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:56,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Corps.

40
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:59,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Pride and service that extends their tours.

41
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Courage seeping, sweating through their pores.

42
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:04,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Death and loss that bravery ignores.

43
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And the river runs through it.

44
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:27,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is a place of misery, native kindness lost in exploitation, liberties for some through subjugation, faith distortions used to build a nation, confinements to the distant reservation, hopeful spirits lost at every station, museum cases filled with infiltration, and a river runs through it.

45
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:44,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is a place of shame, treaties that were violated, tribes that were decimated, disease that was initiated, environment that was devastated, trust that was annihilated, greed that still is celebrated, and a river runs through it.

46
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:47,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is a place of industry.

47
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:49,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Iron was smelted.

48
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Tallow was melted.

49
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Chips were built.

50
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Frames were gilt.

51
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Leather was tanned.

52
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:54,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Bridges were spanned.

53
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:55,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Fabric was dyed.

54
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:56,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Fish was fried.

55
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Rum was distilled.

56
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Barrels were filled.

57
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:00,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Glass was blown.

58
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:01,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Crops were grown.

59
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:02,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Metal was stamped.

60
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:03,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Soldiers encamped.

61
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Milk was homogenized, pasteurized, and fortified.

62
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:09,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And a river runs through it.

63
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:12,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is a place of injury.

64
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:15,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Lies were told as papers passed.

65
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:17,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Covenants never intended to last.

66
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:19,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Stolen lands, great wealth amassed.

67
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:21,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Rampant correction now put on blast.

68
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:24,351
[SPEAKER_08]: How did it get so bad so fast?

69
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:46,431
[SPEAKER_08]: There's silent guilt that sanitizes, race unrest that paralyzes, black lives trying to matter, brown skin made to scatter, red blood spilled and splattered, homes that only sell to some, banks don't lend to everyone, police don't look to serve and protect, fear and loathing breed disrespect, and a river runs through it.

70
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:51,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is still a place of denial, for graves undug to drive a pile.

71
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:56,686
[SPEAKER_08]: The landed gentry remains on trial for sins committed in the church's aisle.

72
00:05:57,327 --> 00:06:06,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And failure to turn equality's dial for actions thought both vain and vile, no small amount of desecration where progress in turn the bones of First Nation.

73
00:06:07,276 --> 00:06:13,824
[SPEAKER_08]: with never a notion toward real preservation and a headlong rush toward contamination.

74
00:06:14,284 --> 00:06:17,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is Misituk's compensation?

75
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:19,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Are bluebacks and herring a standing ovation?

76
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:24,276
[SPEAKER_08]: The watches gather around the formation and a river runs through it.

77
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:35,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is a place of nativity, indigenous braves or slaves in captivity, immigrant enclaves in exclusivity, a treacherous path to beloved community.

78
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:52,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Each clan wears a kindred face, covets a homeland's warm embrace, competing gospels of time and space, every religion and every race, tribal spirits of fire and ice, a thousand types of beans and rice, and a river runs through it.

79
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:58,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is a place of fertility, verdant shores by the sandy beaches.

80
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:01,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Nature grows with the soul beseeches.

81
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:08,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Ash and elm and maple preaches from the silent spring to the epic speeches.

82
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:13,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet poison into the soil leeches, open wounds and ugly breeches.

83
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,202
[SPEAKER_08]: We've yet to learn what nature teaches, and a river runs through it.

84
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:26,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is a tapestry, threads for every color and shade, stripes for every soul displayed.

85
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:31,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Winter and spring, summer and fall, translucent rain that showers all.

86
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:33,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Rainbows await the heart's desire.

87
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:37,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Together we face the cleansing fire.

88
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Families grow strong with true resilience.

89
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:43,185
[SPEAKER_08]: School invests in each child's brilliance.

90
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,128
[SPEAKER_08]: God's design put the scales in balance.

91
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:48,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Each one brings their gifts and talents.

92
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Neighbors embrace a common will despite the screeching fool on the hill.

93
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:58,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Poems are written that resonate still, and a river runs through it.

94
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:17,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Our valley is a place of vibrancy that takes great pride in its energy, that seeks out moments of synergy, that wraps its models in honesty, that guides its resources zealously, that seeks its level with urgency, and a river runs through it.

95
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:34,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Our place is a place of true rebirth, as we try to protect our precious earth, where good people meet to set things right, and the cleanup ensues through the waning light, and then the party takes over the night, and the food and the music is out of sight.

96
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:43,326
[SPEAKER_08]: We gather our kin at the father's shore, and labor together to open the door, and a river runs through it.

97
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:45,607
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

98
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:46,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

99
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:50,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

100
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:50,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

101
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,538
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Patrick, I want to start with you.

102
00:08:53,598 --> 00:09:07,772
[SPEAKER_08]: For the folks that may not be familiar with what you do, can you talk a bit about the overall work of your organization, the communities you serve, and what drew you to the occupation?

103
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:23,209
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a pleasure, but before I do, let me just say that while the Mystic River is a glorious river, it is a humble river, and I can't think of another river around that has been so flattered with words like your poetry on this river.

104
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:36,134
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the Hudson River has poetry about it, or the Connecticut River, or the Saugus or the Nepenthe, so I think we're really grateful that you've made this a work of art for all of us.

105
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:44,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Our organization is trying to create a healthy Mystic River watershed, and that has a lot of different meanings.

106
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:50,727
[SPEAKER_00]: It has meanings from the ecological sense, but also from the sense of all of us as residents of this watershed.

107
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:53,009
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to create a place.

108
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:57,711
[SPEAKER_00]: And this organization started in 1972 and really had as its focus

109
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:07,300
[SPEAKER_00]: the water quality for real concerns about the history of industry and the impact it was having.

110
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:16,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've really expanded to think more about the presence of all of us as people as really important denizens of this watershed.

111
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,751
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to do the work to make sure it's healthy for us as well.

112
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:24,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the work of our organization really covers a lot of ground now.

113
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:28,855
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still focused very much on water quality and fish.

114
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:38,078
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also focused on recreation and active transportation routes through the Domestic Greenways Program, which Carl will share more about tonight.

115
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:42,379
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of work on climate resiliency in partnership with our communities.

116
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:51,442
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to leverage the money that's going into creating protections against climate to make sure they're directed at creating healthier communities.

117
00:10:52,442 --> 00:11:00,925
[SPEAKER_00]: We do environmental education as a big part of our work, and we center environmental justice and equity in our work.

118
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:15,316
[SPEAKER_00]: that a big part of our work is to make sure that we are directing our resources and our capacity as a staff to addressing the pollution where it's most severe, where conditions are furthest behind.

119
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:25,605
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's also a piece of work that we probably didn't have a word for in the 1970s, that I think we are more fluid in terms of how we talk about that.

120
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:28,867
[SPEAKER_00]: We serve 21 communities.

121
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:33,071
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small watershed, but it's 21 communities, and that's one of our challenges.

122
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:46,981
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the way from Reading and Burlington, down through Winchester and Arlington and Medford and Somerville, and down past Everett and into Boston Harbor where Chelsea and East Boston and Charlestown and Revere and Winthrop.

123
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:55,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all communities that we're focused on and working in partnership with residents and other community-based organizations and the state and regulators.

124
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,887
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a very collaborative organization.

125
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,848
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very rarely out there to get anybody.

126
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:04,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we're inviting them into the room to try to work with us.

127
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:11,213
[SPEAKER_00]: We start with the assumption that everybody really wants a healthy place for all of us to be.

128
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:25,239
[SPEAKER_00]: And how I got into this work, I came from academia, and I was just really excited about seeing science applied in partnership with community.

129
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:33,302
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an organization that really tries to hold credible science and viewpoints that are informed by

130
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:41,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Data, data that we gather from water bottles, data we gather from engaging directly with residents to understand concerns.

131
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:47,188
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess there's one more piece of work we've started to do recently is on air quality.

132
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:55,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for this reason that we believe that air quality supports healthy people, it's really clear.

133
00:12:55,993 --> 00:13:00,095
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a really interesting watershed with a lot of industrial areas.

134
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:08,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to understand what those conditions are to see if we can mitigate those pollution sources and help people live healthy lives.

135
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:10,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic, fantastic.

136
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:11,882
[SPEAKER_08]: That explains a lot.

137
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:24,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Carl, if you don't mind, can you kind of do the same with regard to the greenways programs you oversee and bring us into the discussion of the prospective Mystic Lakes pathway initiative?

138
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:25,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

139
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:28,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Terry, thank you so much for having us again here this evening.

140
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:37,175
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mystic Greenways program started in 2016, so we're approaching 10 years.

141
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:47,198
[SPEAKER_01]: And its vision is to connect 25 miles of paths and parks throughout the Mystic River watershed and its tributaries.

142
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Our watershed is the most highly urbanized watershed in New England.

143
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:55,344
[SPEAKER_01]: It carries the brunt of very heavy industry.

144
00:13:56,384 --> 00:13:58,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very densely populated.

145
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:01,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a result of all of those factors, we don't have a lot of open space.

146
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:12,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And so providing linear spaces, linear corridors that connect to these larger parks and connect into communities, you're able to create a network of open spaces.

147
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:17,582
[SPEAKER_01]: So you often hear, oh, 15 minutes walk to a park.

148
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:18,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you might hear that.

149
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:45,363
[SPEAKER_01]: And from here there, but it's it's a really exciting job where we get to Steward and lead on several projects we get to help catalyze Certain parks and pathway projects and others were you know, we're standing with community members advocating for them or advocating for you know Agencies like DCR or cities to to better take care of their open spaces as well and

150
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:47,685
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it really runs the gambit.

151
00:14:49,046 --> 00:15:05,278
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as part of our vision of 25 miles of connected paths and parks, you know, we rely on, you know, really solid planning processes to help identify projects that can make the greatest impact for residents of the watershed and the region at large.

152
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:24,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And just on the eastern shoreline of the, of the mystic lakes here has incredible history, you know, dating back to pre contact pre colonial contact it was a, you know, very, you know, highly utilized, you know, space for indigenous communities to fish into.

153
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,707
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really thrive.

154
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:36,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And over time, as colonization took effect, it was heavily used for industry.

155
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:45,752
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the Middlesex Canal that ran from Lowell to Boston Harbor, right along Mystic Valley Parkway on the eastern shoreline of the lakes.

156
00:15:46,932 --> 00:16:10,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, fast forward, Frederick L. Olmsted and his partner, Charles Elliott, they are the landscape designers who designed Boston Common and Central Park and many of America's parks that you see today, really saw a lot of public value in this space and designed a parkway, which at the time did not include cars.

157
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:34,129
[SPEAKER_01]: speeding 40 to 60 miles an hour it was you know carriages and people walking and they even thought Yeah, it's a you know moving moving more than five miles an hour was considered a little bit too fast for that space and so You know, all of these things are leading up to what you see today at Mystic Valley Parkway and

158
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:38,452
[SPEAKER_01]: And some improvements have been made to the shoreline over the years.

159
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:43,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Recent improvements up at Shannon Beach with a new bath house is very, very nice.

160
00:16:44,397 --> 00:16:54,865
[SPEAKER_01]: In the town of Winchester, there was a small improvements project to add a sidewalk and some parking areas and some nice decorative lighting.

161
00:16:55,466 --> 00:17:02,692
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as you hit the Medford border, it goes into an unimproved, not accessible

162
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:09,395
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt path Going all the way to the high street rotaries which are inherently dangerous as well.

163
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:27,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And so You know, they haven't the space hasn't been looked at in decades, but that doesn't mean people haven't used this space people have made this space their own and really appreciate it for the hiking nature of its of its feel and people walk their dogs, you know as Maybe perhaps you do

164
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:47,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Each and every day and really treat it as a valued resource in the neighborhood And and so really our goal is to take everyone's ideas with this project the Massachusetts Department of Conservation Recreation has identified this as a parkway to improve and make safer and more accessible and

165
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:54,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result, came to us and said, would you like to help kick off this process?

166
00:17:54,963 --> 00:18:02,806
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some greater capacity and partnerships to help gather ideas from folks about what they would like to see for the shoreline.

167
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:16,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same exact time, they're working on a safety improvement project for the rotaries as well right here, and put in crossing for pedestrians to make it a safer, modernized roundabout.

168
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:32,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And so combine all of this together and you're really helping to advance the regional network for safe mobility, for recreation, or just going from A to B, or staying.

169
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:41,260
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many opportunities for improving the amenities that folks can enjoy along this stretch as well.

170
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:50,128
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how we came to be, and it's an exciting part of the larger Mystic Greenways vision.

171
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:52,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good, very good.

172
00:18:53,592 --> 00:19:03,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had the good fortune of serving on a steering committee that's discussing this Mystic Lakes pathway project.

173
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:21,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the focus and the drive to get people to see a vision has been outstanding and we'll talk a little bit more about that, but I want to come back to Patrick because

174
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:45,221
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not a state agency, you're not a city agency, so can you kind of describe your funding and how it fits into the larger scheme of municipalities and communities that you serve?

175
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:51,619
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such an interesting question, because we're a people's agency.

176
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:52,260
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

177
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:59,623
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the hope is that we are driven by community desires and ideas.

178
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:10,788
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps make us who we are, whether it's folks on the steering committee or folks that we recruit to join our board and give direction to us as a staff.

179
00:20:11,488 --> 00:20:13,430
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is we're serving the community.

180
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:21,656
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are a nonprofit, and we have to raise funding to hire staff to hopefully serve the community interests.

181
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:28,002
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to turn over every rock there is to find funding, both to

182
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:34,285
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure we have staff to do this work, but also to actually build the project sometimes or design the project.

183
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:45,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are, a lot of our funding comes directly from community members who will send us in a check once a year and say, look, this is the work that I want to see happen in my community.

184
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we think you're catalyzing that.

185
00:20:49,391 --> 00:21:00,881
[SPEAKER_00]: We also reach out to state agencies and federal agencies and apply for grants because a lot of the goals we have here in the MISTIC and that our community members have are shared by these agencies.

186
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:10,530
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also reach out to foundations and corporations who want to be associated with this work because they share our values.

187
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:18,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's around a healthy environment, whether it's centering equity, that's what we do as an organization.

188
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:24,226
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to act on those values that are informed by residents in the community.

189
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:27,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent, excellent, excellent.

190
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:42,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Carl, I would like to have you, if you would, talk a little bit about the community outreach component that has kind of advanced the discussion of the pathway project and where you are now with that aspect of the initiative.

191
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:57,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so once we received our funding for the project, it was the Mass Trails State Program with some match funding from the Solomon Foundation, we set off to kind of lay out our process for community engagement.

192
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:10,655
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, looking at just the eastern shoreline of the Mystic Lakes, it's a part of, you know, such a valuable asset for, you know, Medford residents, Winchester residents in the region at large, and so we knew

193
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:35,628
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a very valuable asset people, you know, really really cherish it and it's also You know, it's not just the parkway It's the these peninsulas that kind of jut out into the lakes that are overgrown with you know Invasive species and their shoreline erosion and then as you go south of High Street this you know have the same, you know problem with the shoreline here as well and there's a

194
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:42,054
[SPEAKER_01]: On this side, there's no path that someone with a wheelchair might, for example, be able to use.

195
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:47,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew that this is just the start of the conversation.

196
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:52,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we wanted residents in the room at each and every step.

197
00:22:52,883 --> 00:23:02,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from the outset, we sought to convene a steering committee of residents who expressed an interest in being involved in the project.

198
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:22,458
[SPEAKER_01]: We received over 45 applications from folks in the area, and we ended up selecting 10 residents that we feel have been great to collaborate with and receive guidance on from the project.

199
00:23:23,258 --> 00:23:29,123
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had the opportunity to, you know, meet with them in a more formal setting three times now.

200
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:39,533
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we've done some site walks and, you know, and they've helped to table at recent community events as well.

201
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:44,757
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and Terry is on the steering committee, so thank you.

202
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:49,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have Simon here this evening who's on the steering committee as well.

203
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:59,254
[SPEAKER_01]: But you really as a guiding hand, see the steering committee as a guiding hand in our work and also our engagement strategy.

204
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:07,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is a large project, we wanted to make sure that the meetings that we're holding publicly

205
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:19,159
[SPEAKER_01]: for residents, and we've hosted three to date so far, or two to date, and our third public meeting for this round of work is this coming Tuesday.

206
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:27,089
[SPEAKER_01]: There's information on the table that you can receive in order to kind of see our refined design concepts for the project.

207
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:36,914
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we started that process in the very first public meeting with a initial visioning phase.

208
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:39,676
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really asked folks for their hopes and dreams.

209
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:47,800
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you currently like about the shoreline in Mystic Valley Parkway there along Mystic Lakes?

210
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,321
[SPEAKER_01]: What don't you currently like?

211
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:52,102
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you like to see that's not currently there?

212
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:53,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you think we should avoid?

213
00:24:54,184 --> 00:25:06,859
[SPEAKER_01]: And we received over 1,200 unique comments from members of the public that we were able to really package up and summarize for our design team to start to get to work on some initial ideas.

214
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,403
[SPEAKER_01]: We then came back for our second round of engagement.

215
00:25:11,064 --> 00:25:21,117
[SPEAKER_01]: The first round was in February, second round was in the beginning of April, where we presented three initial ideas that had a mix and match of different themes and strategies for the project.

216
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:27,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And we asked for folks' preferences and additional ideas and thoughts on those.

217
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:35,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Shook that up and now we're at our third phase of the work that we're doing in this stretch.

218
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:45,362
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have the opportunity to speak with residents in each and every stage and really appreciate the steering committee for lending a guiding hand through that process.

219
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:51,512
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a very, very constructive conversation.

220
00:25:51,532 --> 00:26:07,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if folks might avail themselves of the opportunity to attend the third public meeting, they'd get a real good sense of overall how we came to some conclusions.

221
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:09,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's fantastic.

222
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:21,920
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so Patrick, you kind of have a 10,000 foot vision on everything that's going on in the watershed.

223
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:36,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you share a few thoughts about, from what you've seen in the science that you've seen, the work that your folks are doing, how climate change is impacting the watershed, both from a science perspective and a people aspect?

224
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:43,903
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a prescient comment.

225
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're living in a climate-impacted watershed now.

226
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:53,027
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for a long time we had this language of, well, we have to be ready for 2030.

227
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:54,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have to be ready for 2070.

228
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, we've got to be ready for now.

229
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:06,540
[SPEAKER_00]: We are experiencing really intense rainfall events, and that's unusual weather patterns.

230
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:12,027
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to experience periods of drought that we won't expect.

231
00:27:13,516 --> 00:27:22,903
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're experiencing sometimes very hot temperatures that will impact some of our residents more than others for a variety of reasons.

232
00:27:24,264 --> 00:27:29,648
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how does this translate into what we see on the ground here in the watershed?

233
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all,

234
00:27:32,924 --> 00:27:38,626
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see rain coming in really big bunches like we do, and we've got a bunch of rain already this year.

235
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:40,066
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a bunch last year.

236
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:44,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Our infrastructure can't hold it back.

237
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:47,548
[SPEAKER_00]: So that water is overrunning our sewer systems.

238
00:27:47,608 --> 00:27:52,069
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually dumping raw sewage into Alewife Brook and to the Mystic River.

239
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:56,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on one side, we're like, oh, come recreate on the Mystic River.

240
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,451
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we have to tell you on Tuesday

241
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:04,455
[SPEAKER_00]: 5 million gallons of sewage went down the river because our infrastructure wasn't big enough.

242
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:08,519
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't big enough for now, let alone 2030 or 2070.

243
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:12,983
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a tremendous investment that needs to be made to protect this resource.

244
00:28:14,284 --> 00:28:17,387
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of temperatures, as we get warmer and warmer,

245
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:26,793
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really clear that our communities in leafy suburbs and well air-conditioned homes, I think they're going to be okay.

246
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:46,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that communities that are living in rental properties or lower income, they are typically living on streets with less trees, in homes that may not have air conditioning, or just turning on the air conditioning may be a big investment for them in terms of their bills.

247
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:52,690
[SPEAKER_00]: So, HEAT's going to begin impacting people, both their public health as well as their pocketbook.

248
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:54,711
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what do we do?

249
00:28:55,272 --> 00:29:04,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the thing we're trying to do is to shine a light on this problem and get the state to prioritize some of these investments and infrastructure.

250
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:15,909
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with many of our municipalities here and the state to plant more trees in communities with less trees, and really work with residents to find out what kind of trees they want and where they want trees.

251
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:22,395
[SPEAKER_00]: In Medford, we're working with some great groups to actually give people trees they can plant in their own backyard if they want as well.

252
00:29:22,915 --> 00:29:25,517
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's happening right now, Terry.

253
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:46,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Carl, I want to ask you about, you've been kind of bringing these new infrastructure and environmental projects to the public forum, not only with this project, but others that you've been helping to lead for a number of years now.

254
00:29:46,474 --> 00:29:54,000
[SPEAKER_08]: What kinds of things that you've learned are kind of really surprising to you?

255
00:29:57,065 --> 00:30:11,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think I think to dovetail off of what Patrick said it's it's like creating spaces for that work, not like for now, and help us now not only 30 years from now, has been really eye opening.

256
00:30:12,665 --> 00:30:24,453
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's these, you know, spaces that are going to provide really strong respite from heat, even though you might live in a heat island area or you live in an area with a lot of asphalt and no tree cover.

257
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:33,759
[SPEAKER_01]: We are leading a project in Charlestown on the Little Mystic Channel, which is, you know, underneath the Tobin Bridge, essentially.

258
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:53,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a census tract that's a hundred percent, you know, low moderate income housing and we're creating a nice cool shaded plaza right next to affordable housing complex using Community Preservation Act funding and some funding from our private foundations who we work with as well.

259
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,190
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a quick project.

260
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,472
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a you know fast design project.

261
00:30:58,512 --> 00:31:13,446
[SPEAKER_01]: We we largely engaged the residents of the public housing immediately adjacent and Got to work where we're gonna break ground and next month and it's gonna be done by the spring and we started that process last summer so it's

262
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:16,848
[SPEAKER_01]: So fast in an infrastructure sense, right?

263
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:25,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the biggest surprising thing is these projects do take a long time and there's a lot of regulation involved and a lot of public process that should be done.

264
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:37,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what does surprise me though is I think we've come a long way, or I hope so, in terms of the way that infrastructure projects are done.

265
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:50,025
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of recent memory, you know, dating back 40, 50 years where highways are going through communities and never, I never had to say when I had to leave my house or received a notice of the taking.

266
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:56,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think nowadays it's a lot more, it's a lot more collaborative, it's a lot more engaging, which is great.

267
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:06,154
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of the projects, it's really hearing about the passion of folks who are really excited to see improvements in their own backyard and have the opportunity to help make it a reality is really exciting.

268
00:32:08,895 --> 00:32:27,379
[SPEAKER_08]: As we've been sitting and having these public meetings and having meetings of the steering committee, I think what's been illuminating to me is the notion that there's a lot of different kinds of people that use these resources in a lot of different ways.

269
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:32,080
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you build something that works for

270
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:40,987
[SPEAKER_08]: these folks, but you don't take these folks into consideration, there can be a lot of hurt in that.

271
00:32:41,647 --> 00:32:52,697
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think one of the things that has been really good about, and Patrick and I were talking about it earlier, about the steering committee, is you thought about handicapped access.

272
00:32:53,197 --> 00:32:57,258
[SPEAKER_08]: You've thought about folks potentially in wheelchairs or walking with canes.

273
00:32:57,658 --> 00:33:17,683
[SPEAKER_08]: You've also thought about people that have dogs and folks that need to be able to avoid bicycles and avoid these new e-bikes and scooters and all manners of other contraptions that are out there that they have to share the road with.

274
00:33:18,423 --> 00:33:22,424
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's been illuminating to me is that

275
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:26,027
[SPEAKER_08]: We use these resources in a lot of different ways.

276
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:28,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you can't be monolithic in your thinking.

277
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:31,013
[SPEAKER_08]: You really have to be more expansive.

278
00:33:31,614 --> 00:33:37,540
[SPEAKER_08]: And bringing all these different kinds of folks to the table has led to a real rich discussion.

279
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:38,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

280
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:38,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

281
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:39,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Very rich.

282
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so you're in a new organizational home now in 23 Maple Street in Arlington.

283
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:50,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about how that all came about.

284
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:53,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got a chance to visit it recently.

285
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, thank you for highlighting that.

286
00:33:55,663 --> 00:33:56,583
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been long overdue.

287
00:33:56,623 --> 00:34:00,364
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in the town of Arlington for a long time.

288
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:08,846
[SPEAKER_00]: To their credit, the town of Arlington a long time ago gave us a tiny little office space when we had one staff person and said, you know what, you can just have it.

289
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:16,030
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grew to two staff and three staff, and we had to come and say, well, there's a closet over there.

290
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think we could use that closet?

291
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:19,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, fine, you can use that closet.

292
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:21,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, we outgrew the space.

293
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were really generous.

294
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,235
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up paying for that space.

295
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,637
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were really struggling to find a new home.

296
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:30,959
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked in Malden, and we're pretty close.

297
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:33,861
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really excited about getting on the Orange Line, which was right there.

298
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:34,601
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work out.

299
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:49,506
[SPEAKER_00]: A building that was right next door to our building, which is about four times larger space, opened up, and we've had the chance to improve the floors, paint the walls, and welcome our community.

300
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:57,569
[SPEAKER_00]: It has enough space for a team of about 19 people now, and we've got five summer fellows there with us.

301
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:09,002
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, the work really comes alive when you've got that number of people all working, young to older people like myself, all in the same building and in a productive space.

302
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:16,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is really exciting and hopefully it's like the next chapter of the organization or that next rung that lets us reach up a little higher with our work.

303
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:24,162
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting because the community center here, from the street, this looks like a home.

304
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:31,066
[SPEAKER_08]: And your building, it must have been somebody's residence at some point in time.

305
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:31,806
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, a long time ago.

306
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:40,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And what will make it even a better home is to get Terry's poem, A River Runs Through It, on one of our walls inside the building.

307
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:44,993
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have to work that out, but that will make it feel like a home, quite frankly.

308
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:47,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, that's nice.

309
00:35:47,374 --> 00:35:47,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

310
00:35:47,874 --> 00:35:48,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

311
00:35:49,155 --> 00:36:00,581
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a third public meeting on the Mystic Lakes pathway project, and you mentioned it, but I'd like to have you mention it again.

312
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:04,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It's happening next week.

313
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:07,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell folks what will be discussed and how they can be included?

314
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.

315
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,262
[SPEAKER_01]: The third public meeting, it's being held online on Zoom this coming Tuesday evening.

316
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:19,504
[SPEAKER_01]: There are pros and cons to in-person versus online.

317
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,326
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been able to, I think, reach a broader, a lot more people online, which has been good.

318
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:30,548
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm happy to talk about the project and the meeting in person here tonight, if you'd like.

319
00:36:31,948 --> 00:36:45,653
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned before, you know, over the past five months, we've been going through a process to help, you know, identify a vision for the project on the eastern shoreline of the Mystic Lakes.

320
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:53,876
[SPEAKER_01]: And then present some initial ideas for what might be incorporated into the project.

321
00:36:53,936 --> 00:36:59,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this project is presenting a refined design concept.

322
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:05,381
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, again, this is the first step in a longer process.

323
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:16,668
[SPEAKER_01]: After tonight's meeting, or Tuesday's meeting, and we receive feedback we're going to finalize a report that we are then going to hand to the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.

324
00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:25,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully they will put the project kind of into their mechanisms for being designed and eventually constructed.

325
00:37:28,196 --> 00:37:39,705
[SPEAKER_01]: So after June 30th, we're going to be kind of taking a step back from the project and becoming local champions and advocates like you to help see it happen.

326
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:44,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the meeting this coming Tuesday night.

327
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,092
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have also, there's a list of other upcoming events.

328
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:55,339
[SPEAKER_01]: If infrastructure or Greenways projects isn't your thing, we have some volunteer opportunities, some educational events coming up.

329
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:58,862
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a list on the table as well if you're interested.

330
00:37:59,062 --> 00:38:03,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you maybe talk a little bit about what some of those opportunities are?

331
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:07,510
[SPEAKER_08]: What types of things folks who want to get involved can do?

332
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:16,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we have we have no no short of an invasive species In our watershed, so we do do volunteer cleanup days.

333
00:38:16,516 --> 00:38:35,929
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good good way to get outside, but we have literature on community boating programs and we are hosting a number of tablings that Farmers markets we were at the Medford farmers market just yesterday and so our staff and our summer and

334
00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:45,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Fellows especially are kind of all throughout the watershed kind of doing these different initiatives and As I mentioned too, we have a robust educator program.

335
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:57,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in nature based education we go into local schools and our educator Natalia does an amazing job with that and always looking for for educators as well and

336
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:13,712
[SPEAKER_01]: so so yeah, there's I think education, you know volunteering in a stewardship capacity and Patrick we have I don't know if there's anything to add but we also are wrapping up our herring annual herring run where the the it's a wife herring That's right.

337
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:19,896
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go online mystic herring org and you can help us count the fish there's a camera in the water at the dam and

338
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:26,497
[SPEAKER_00]: We record these videos and ask for help, and we get about 5,000 people coming online to help us count the fish.

339
00:39:26,537 --> 00:39:35,579
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry, this is a little trivia here, but this Mystic River is home to one of the largest migrations of herring in all of Massachusetts.

340
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,419
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually number one or number two in the whole state.

341
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,320
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a source of great pride, I have to say.

342
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good, very good.

343
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,921
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you had your druthers,

344
00:39:50,426 --> 00:40:00,752
[SPEAKER_08]: between the science piece, the people piece, and the out in the nature piece.

345
00:40:04,214 --> 00:40:06,916
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the biggest pull on you personally?

346
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:13,125
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it used to be the nature piece, but now, you know, we're not rural Montana.

347
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:23,917
[SPEAKER_00]: We're among the most densely developed places, and this is something that Carl was mentioning, and we're 76 square miles, and we're 21 communities.

348
00:40:23,937 --> 00:40:27,661
[SPEAKER_00]: 76 square miles is the same size as Brooklyn, which is one community.

349
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:39,011
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this amazing challenge ahead of us to create a place that's so filled with people that people will really have a healthy life here.

350
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:48,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're growing up in West Medford or you're Cambridge or you're down in Chelsea, that everybody's got clean air, access to great parks, access to recreation.

351
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:52,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these improvements are overdue.

352
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:54,006
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just so overdue.

353
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:59,332
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's other places you can go and be like, gosh, we've still got a ways to go in a lot of these places.

354
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:10,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the work that really excites me and makes me feel like the more people involved pushing for it, we can create a place that we're all really proud of.

355
00:41:11,665 --> 00:41:20,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And in that, obviously, you have to establish priorities for the different things that you would like to do in a perfect world.

356
00:41:20,473 --> 00:41:21,434
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to do all of it.

357
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:31,142
[SPEAKER_08]: But how does that piece kind of get settled out in terms of, OK, we have these nine things that we want to do.

358
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:32,724
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the highest priority?

359
00:41:34,229 --> 00:41:34,989
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always hard.

360
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:43,752
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you recognize emerging moments that you have a moment that you can grab.

361
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,793
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what's happening on the Mystic Lakes right now.

362
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:52,515
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a moment that we saw with a Mass Trails grant and some relationships there.

363
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:58,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're really lucky, we'll all come together if we do our work right.

364
00:41:59,657 --> 00:42:02,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times things are emerging and are of moment

365
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:06,819
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, at Shannon Beach.

366
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:13,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Shannon Beach, I don't know if you know this, it was closed all last year because of water quality.

367
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:25,405
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go there and swim, but the lifeguards were all over at the picnic table because they'd been told they can't, you know, be out there because it never met the water quality, the way they calculated.

368
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:29,770
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a moment to be like, how can that be?

369
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:31,012
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to work on this.

370
00:42:31,052 --> 00:42:37,160
[SPEAKER_00]: We either have to fix the water quality, or we've got to fix the notification system.

371
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,465
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it that this incredibly important resource

372
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:51,054
[SPEAKER_00]: is not being used to its full capacity by all these residents who are showing up and trying to get a parking spot and ending up on side streets.

373
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:56,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much need there, and it's like a moment, so we have to work on it.

374
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:03,944
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the residents say it, but it's also team members inside Myra who are just outraged.

375
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:06,326
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't sit still.

376
00:43:06,406 --> 00:43:09,489
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, I have to be in the room to talk about this and work on this.

377
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:11,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic, fantastic.

378
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:22,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And this moment that we're in where the potential exists for doing something really meaningful with that, that's about a two mile stretch.

379
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:36,601
[SPEAKER_08]: What else that you have on your plate right now kind of equals that in terms of one, the people's desire to get it done, and your desire to see it get done?

380
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:42,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in terms of regional benefit, it's probably numero uno.

381
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:46,055
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a state park.

382
00:43:46,135 --> 00:43:47,736
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mystic Lake State Park.

383
00:43:48,076 --> 00:43:58,202
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no sign that says, welcome to Mystic Lake State Park, much as you might see in the suburbs where you turn off the state road.

384
00:43:58,242 --> 00:44:03,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a nice park service sign that says, welcome to the state park.

385
00:44:03,805 --> 00:44:04,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the ranger who's

386
00:44:05,086 --> 00:44:25,059
[SPEAKER_01]: says hello right this is very like very like I'm entering this space that's very you know kind of natural and oh there's there's trail maps and I can there there's a visitor center with the bathroom right we have that at Shannon Beach now which is great but like the the experience at a state park should be a lot better than

387
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:46,383
[SPEAKER_01]: highway or sorry a road where You know 99% of the cars speed and I can't cross the street because there's no place to cross the street there's no signage saying that this is a state park and All the shorelines overgrown and there's only one place to access it at Shannon Beach Officially and so it's like what are we doing?

388
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:52,104
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I think it's like it's it's an incredible regional asset and Needs to be valued

389
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:57,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Two miles goes by very quickly, and so how can we make it as accessible, as safe as possible?

390
00:44:58,669 --> 00:45:10,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we make it a regional destination for people with physical or mental disability by adding in a sensory trail for people with visual impairments or neurodivergence?

391
00:45:11,598 --> 00:45:36,863
[SPEAKER_01]: You know at bare minimum making sure that it's ADA accessible for everyone to equally or equitably enjoy the space We're working on very valuable projects that are services serving City of Malden or residents in Charlestown or other DCR parks But I think like this is a this is a regional destination where people are going to swim barbecue enjoy life and and I think that's that's it's it's pretty pretty up there and

392
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

393
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:44,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, the first time I ever got to fish it was down at, we called it Sandy Beach at the time.

394
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:45,181
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

395
00:45:45,842 --> 00:45:48,482
[SPEAKER_01]: An elected official at some point got his name on it.

396
00:45:48,522 --> 00:45:50,543
[SPEAKER_08]: It is what it is.

397
00:45:51,623 --> 00:46:03,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So folks, if you have an opportunity, there's information about it over on the table about the third public meeting of the Mystic Lakes Pathway Planning Committee.

398
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:28,261
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a good thing to do if you can get on Zoom and have a listen because there's a lot that's being talked about and the ultimate plan is a pretty robust use of the space and a pretty significant change to the space.

399
00:46:29,862 --> 00:46:41,806
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can say one more thing, so we have some flyers that you can grab and take with you but if you can't make the meeting and Putting kids down to sleep or dinner or just I don't have any for a zoom meeting.

400
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:51,850
[SPEAKER_01]: We have we'll have the same materials available online or contact information as well on a website that's on a flyer for for a few weeks, so

401
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:59,976
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you can't make that exact time, no worries, pop in a few days later and you'll have a chance to engage in the project.

402
00:47:00,837 --> 00:47:01,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

403
00:47:01,357 --> 00:47:01,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Carl.

404
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:03,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give you the last word.

405
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:10,044
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think you want the people to know about who you are, what you're doing, and why you're doing it?

406
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:14,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've said a lot of that, Terry, and I'm

407
00:47:16,122 --> 00:47:30,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just say that one piece of trivia is that you've got bald eagles that have just hatched and have three eaglets in the nest, but a half mile away from us here, just on the other side of the lake.

408
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:35,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we forget that we're embedded in the Mystic River.

409
00:47:36,216 --> 00:47:39,037
[SPEAKER_00]: And Terry, I know your roots run really deep here.

410
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:57,324
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe my last message is just gratitude that you've taken this river under your wing and raised attention of this and contributed your art toward raising awareness of both the river and also the issues and social history around this river and West Medford being centered for a lot of the history here.

411
00:47:58,684 --> 00:48:01,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Kami is grateful for having us and for your work.

412
00:48:01,868 --> 00:48:17,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the community center benefits when, in our general environment, things happen that can reflect the light back onto what this community is, what this community's been.

413
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:22,255
[SPEAKER_08]: in the access that we've had, but also the access that we've been denied.

414
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:32,270
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I have an opportunity to do something meaningful in that regard, I'm probably going to try and take advantage of the opportunity.

415
00:48:33,894 --> 00:48:38,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Gentlemen, I think that's about all the time we have to chop it up, as they say.

416
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:42,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, we haven't had to water the discussion down too much.

417
00:48:42,563 --> 00:48:43,204
[SPEAKER_08]: See what I did there?

418
00:48:43,644 --> 00:48:43,944
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

419
00:48:44,465 --> 00:48:49,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for bringing your organizational perspectives and working experience to the table this evening.

420
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:54,856
[SPEAKER_08]: We are clearly in a season of dramatic change in our natural environment.

421
00:48:55,376 --> 00:49:00,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Thoughtful stewardship and diverse collaboration is needed more than ever before.

422
00:49:00,801 --> 00:49:11,731
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to know that the Mystic River Watershed is advancing progressive approaches to preserving and sharing the river's resources across a broad span of connected communities.

423
00:49:12,512 --> 00:49:17,876
[SPEAKER_08]: And to everyone watching, thanks so much for your attentiveness and your interest in our discussion.

00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:31,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

426
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:42,730
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, folks.

00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:47,212
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a pretty quick turnaround, so we're going to settle in.

428
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:51,435

[SPEAKER_08]: Just want to call your attention to some current attractions.

437
00:54:45,855 --> 00:54:51,458
[SPEAKER_08]: There's really quite a lot going on in West Medford and Medford proper over the next few weeks.

454
00:56:59,344 --> 00:57:00,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it's just one day.

455
00:57:00,965 --> 00:57:02,306
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all in one place.

456
00:57:02,606 --> 00:57:11,712
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be some of the artists in West Medford Community Center, but most everything else is taking place across the street at Duggar Park.

465
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:21,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so now it's time to turn our attention, as we always do, to what I refer to as the lyrical miracle that we've engaged for this evening's side of the musical ledger.

466
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:31,313
[SPEAKER_08]: So in 1785, the Scottish poet Robert Burns wrote, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry or astray.

467
00:58:32,094 --> 00:58:36,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's musical program is a classic example of that sentiment.

468
00:58:36,198 --> 00:58:45,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, our original entertainment for the evening was supposed to be a return engagement for the wonderful pairing of Athene Wilson and Rollins Ross.

469
00:58:45,907 --> 00:58:55,957
[SPEAKER_08]: However, Athene called me early this morning in with considerable regret, informing me that she had no voice and was really, really feeling quite poorly.

470
00:58:56,597 --> 00:59:07,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Still, being the pro that she is, she secured another amazing colleague and vocalist to join brother Rollins, who's back here on the keys, for this evening's show.

471
00:59:07,322 --> 00:59:10,384
[SPEAKER_08]: He is none other than the remarkable David Fuller.

472
00:59:10,864 --> 00:59:14,566
[SPEAKER_08]: David is an accomplished musician and a retired educator.

473
00:59:14,586 --> 00:59:15,246
[SPEAKER_08]: He has

474
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:18,788
[SPEAKER_08]: decades of experience on the stage.

475
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:23,930
[SPEAKER_08]: He's also a teacher, a counselor, an administrator, former.

476
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:32,393
[SPEAKER_08]: He is currently a working drummer and vocalist who performs all over New England at weddings, club dates, and a variety of special events.

477
00:59:32,433 --> 00:59:40,496
[SPEAKER_08]: He praises God for his extensive career and his opportunity to develop friendships, support students, and make music.

478
00:59:40,996 --> 00:59:42,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Noah Thien, no problem.

479
00:59:42,757 --> 00:59:44,558
[SPEAKER_08]: David is here to help save the day.

480
00:59:45,919 --> 00:59:50,205
[SPEAKER_08]: David is accompanied by an old friend of the program, Rollins Ross.

481
00:59:56,662 --> 00:59:57,142
[SPEAKER_08]: See that?

482
00:59:57,182 --> 00:59:57,582
[SPEAKER_08]: See that?

483
00:59:57,602 --> 00:59:58,422
[SPEAKER_08]: See how that works?

484
00:59:58,583 --> 00:59:58,983
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

485
00:59:59,383 --> 01:00:05,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Rawlins is a frequent collaborator with the Theme Wilson and numerous other musical luminaries in the Boston area.

486
01:00:06,204 --> 01:00:15,907
[SPEAKER_08]: He is also a music educator and has a heart for getting young people involved in music and music production, conducting workshops and classes throughout Boston neighborhoods.

487
01:00:16,327 --> 01:00:20,928
[SPEAKER_08]: He is a keyboard virtuoso, an arranger, and prolific music producer as well.

488
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:27,350
[SPEAKER_08]: We're excited and blessed to have him and David back in the building.

489
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:31,052
[SPEAKER_08]: With that said, I'm going to get out the way and let the brothers play.

490
01:00:31,372 --> 01:00:36,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, David Fuller and Rollins Ross live at 111 Arlington Street.

491
01:00:37,854 --> 01:00:38,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Terry, thank you very much.

492
01:00:41,658 --> 01:00:43,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say a couple of words about West Medford.

493
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,039
[SPEAKER_06]: West Medford is very close to my heart.

494
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:59,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm from Brooklyn, Framingham, but I met a guy many years ago, Stanley Benders, who lives, well, he used to be in Jerome Street way back when, and now he's on Oakland Street.

495
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:05,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Stanley's my best friend, and I was in a group called the Ellis Hall Group in the 70s.

496
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:06,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the drummer.

497
01:01:07,887 --> 01:01:11,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And I met so many wonderful men and women from West Medford.

498
01:01:11,069 --> 01:01:14,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, West Medford, you can look around and see the history.

499
01:01:15,191 --> 01:01:22,655
[SPEAKER_06]: But West Medford is very, very, very unique, this community, the history behind that.

500
01:01:23,395 --> 01:01:27,337
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, my father was a social worker and did some community work in this area.

501
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:29,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is close to my heart.

502
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:33,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played with so many good musicians from West Medford.

503
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:40,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know the Terry Lynn Carrington's and the Sonny Carrington's and the Alan Dawson's and those folks.

504
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:44,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I had Alan as a teacher when I was at Berkeley years ago.

505
01:01:45,553 --> 01:01:50,978
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, Terry Lynn, we all knew her when she was a little person and now she's a giant.

506
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:57,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Rollins works with Terry exclusively and knows her dad also.

507
01:01:57,865 --> 01:02:02,828
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just want to say that the talent that came out of West Medford musically is unparalleled.

508
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:06,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a musician not from here, it's amazing.

509
01:02:06,371 --> 01:02:10,193
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing to see the talent that has come out of here.

510
01:02:10,253 --> 01:02:11,374
[SPEAKER_06]: And it continues to come out.

511
01:02:11,934 --> 01:02:14,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd just like to say that and give a shout out to West Medford.

512
01:02:14,776 --> 01:02:17,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Terry, thank you for your wonderful work that you're doing.

513
01:02:18,598 --> 01:02:21,000
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just want to look at some songs tonight

514
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:26,075
[SPEAKER_06]: about a positive thing, a positive vein.

515
01:02:27,155 --> 01:02:33,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to start with a song by Bill Withers called Lovely Day, because we need more lovely days than ever.

516
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:35,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Amen?

517
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:36,700
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

518
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:48,526
[SPEAKER_06]: When I wake up in the morning, love, sunlight hurts my eyes.

519
01:02:52,146 --> 01:03:01,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Something without wanting love weighs heavy on my mind.

520
01:03:01,388 --> 01:03:09,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, then I look at you, and the world's all right with me.

521
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:19,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one look at you, and I know it's going to be.

522
01:03:23,059 --> 01:03:24,940
[SPEAKER_06]: A lovely day.

523
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:31,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

524
01:03:33,864 --> 01:03:36,805
[SPEAKER_02]: A lovely day.

525
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:37,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.

526
01:03:46,846 --> 01:04:05,659
[SPEAKER_06]: When the day that lies ahead of me seems impossible to face, then someone else instead of me always seems to know the way.

527
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:14,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that I look at you, and the world's all right with me.

528
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:30,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just one look at you, and I know it's going to be a lovely day.

529
01:04:31,198 --> 01:04:34,039
Oh, a lovely day.

530
01:04:48,336 --> 01:04:50,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, on keyboard, Mr. Rollins Rollins.

531
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,546
[SPEAKER_03]: A lovely day.

532
01:05:36,247 --> 01:05:43,588
[SPEAKER_03]: A lovely day, a lovely day when I look at you.

533
01:05:43,948 --> 01:05:46,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a lovely day.

534
01:05:46,229 --> 01:05:48,529
[SPEAKER_03]: A lovely day.

535
01:05:48,629 --> 01:05:49,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

536
01:06:08,874 --> 01:06:11,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you know this song, the classic songs.

537
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:16,257
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's cliche nowadays to say they don't write songs like they used to, but they really don't.

538
01:06:18,578 --> 01:06:19,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you remember this.

539
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:27,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want to sing along and sway from side to side, now, this is not a dance floor, and that's OK.

540
01:06:28,602 --> 01:06:29,402
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can sway.

541
01:06:29,422 --> 01:06:32,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think you're going to want it, too.

542
01:06:39,608 --> 01:06:45,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Darling, you send me.

543
01:06:45,113 --> 01:06:52,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that you send me.

[SPEAKER_06]: Honest, you do.

[SPEAKER_06]: Honest, you do.

553
01:07:32,658 --> 01:07:35,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Honest, you do.

554
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:41,401
[SPEAKER_06]: At first, I thought it was infatuation.

555
01:07:41,421 --> 01:07:42,301
[SPEAKER_06]: But it lasted so long.

556
01:07:51,903 --> 01:07:55,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I find myself wanting you.

557
01:07:56,586 --> 01:08:09,373
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to marry you and take you home, whoa, you send me.

[SPEAKER_06]: Honest you do.

[SPEAKER_06]: Ramos, what you going to do, brother?

565
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:33,635

[SPEAKER_06]: See, he's talking to me right now.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, one of the classics that everybody knows.

01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:50,985
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we do a lot of weddings and club dates.

592
01:12:53,564 --> 01:13:02,290
[SPEAKER_06]: But especially weddings, when you look at the audience when we sing this song, there may be a five-year-old little boy or girl that knows this song.

593
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:06,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And it goes way up to 85-year-olds.

01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:08,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody knows this song.

[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out.

01:13:11,355 --> 01:13:17,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I got sunshine on a cloudy day.

597
01:13:22,563 --> 01:13:29,117
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's cold outside baby, I got the month of May.

598
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:31,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

599
01:13:32,869 --> 01:13:44,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess you say, what can make me feel this way?

01:15:57,831 --> 01:16:01,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Each and every day I think about my girl.

01:16:02,356 --> 01:16:08,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So much in love talking about my girl.

628
01:16:09,643 --> 01:16:14,808
[SPEAKER_06]: If you remember this song back in the 60s, I had an opportunity to see this band.

629
01:16:14,848 --> 01:16:18,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in my high school years, but I went and saw this group.

630
01:16:18,591 --> 01:16:19,773
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a song called

631
01:16:26,195 --> 01:16:30,118
[SPEAKER_06]: on a Sunday afternoon.

632
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:39,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really, couldn't get away too soon.

633
01:16:39,744 --> 01:16:42,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Want to say it again, baby.

01:16:42,886 --> 01:16:50,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Groovin' on a Sunday afternoon.

[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

636
01:16:54,628 --> 01:17:01,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really, really, really, really, really, couldn't get away too soon.

637
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:05,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you remember the song about the temptations?

638
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:15,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Each day through my window, I watch her as she passes by.

639
01:17:16,394 --> 01:17:22,136
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I say to myself, David, you're such a lucky guy.

640
01:17:28,089 --> 01:17:35,615
[SPEAKER_06]: To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true.

641
01:17:35,775 --> 01:17:47,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, out of all the fellas in this world, baby, she belongs to you.

642
01:17:47,244 --> 01:17:47,945
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

643
01:17:49,346 --> 01:17:52,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just my imagination.

644
01:17:55,299 --> 01:17:57,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Runnin' away with me.

645
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Fellas, can you relate to this?

646
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:03,862
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just my imagination, baby.

647
01:18:05,202 --> 01:18:07,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Runnin' away with me.

648
01:18:09,344 --> 01:18:11,385
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I thought, I said, possibly.

649
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:15,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Soon we'll be married.

650
01:18:15,986 --> 01:18:17,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll raise a family.

651
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:30,713
[SPEAKER_06]: A cozy little home in West Medford with two children, maybe three.

652
01:18:32,553 --> 01:18:40,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell you, I can visualize it all.

653
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:42,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I can.

654
01:18:44,377 --> 01:18:51,380
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be a dream for two real, it all seems.

655
01:18:54,710 --> 01:19:02,934
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was just my imagination once again running away with me.

656
01:19:03,234 --> 01:19:06,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it was just my imagination running away with me.

657
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:07,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it right there.

658
01:19:07,556 --> 01:19:09,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Running away with me.

659
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:26,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Running away with me.

660
01:19:27,675 --> 01:19:32,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Running away with me.

661
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:34,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes.

662
01:19:35,899 --> 01:19:36,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

663
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:41,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes.

664
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:50,547
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many songs that are out there, some good messages, some not so good messages.

665
01:19:52,486 --> 01:19:58,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Terry and I, Rollins, and many of you grew up in an era where the lyrics talked about true love.

666
01:19:59,351 --> 01:20:02,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, true love, and not gibberish.

667
01:20:03,454 --> 01:20:04,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I had to say it.

668
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:07,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate it's their time.

669
01:20:07,809 --> 01:20:08,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand it.

670
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:12,130
[SPEAKER_06]: My lovely daughter lives in New Orleans, playing great music.

671
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:14,851
[SPEAKER_06]: But I taught her how to do the real stuff.

672
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:16,851
[SPEAKER_06]: And she does it all.

673
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:18,431
[SPEAKER_06]: She's traveled around the world.

674
01:20:18,471 --> 01:20:19,051
[SPEAKER_06]: God bless her.

675
01:20:20,132 --> 01:20:23,032
[SPEAKER_06]: She studied at Berkeley and had a great education.

676
01:20:24,813 --> 01:20:28,913
[SPEAKER_06]: But these songs are songs of love and hope.

677
01:20:30,234 --> 01:20:32,314
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes.

678
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:39,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the most prolific writers was Lionel Richie.

679
01:20:39,672 --> 01:20:41,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you see him on TV right now.

680
01:20:41,813 --> 01:20:46,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And I saw them when I was in college, Historical Black College, West Virginia State University down in West Virginia.

681
01:20:47,594 --> 01:20:49,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was in the Commodores.

682
01:20:49,735 --> 01:20:50,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And he played saxophone.

683
01:20:51,075 --> 01:20:53,396
[SPEAKER_06]: He had his afro like we did.

684
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:55,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what happened.

685
01:21:00,598 --> 01:21:01,418
[SPEAKER_06]: But who knew he would

686
01:21:04,395 --> 01:21:09,617
[SPEAKER_06]: move on to a level of writing significant songs.

687
01:21:11,017 --> 01:21:15,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And you don't hear, this wasn't one of his biggest hits, but one of our favorites.

688
01:21:17,519 --> 01:21:21,921
[SPEAKER_06]: And it talks about love will find a way, because we truly believe that love will find a way.

689
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:23,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Love has to find a way.

690
01:21:24,542 --> 01:21:27,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's up to us to teach the little ones to grow up and do that.

691
01:21:27,943 --> 01:21:33,525
[SPEAKER_06]: As an educator and a musician, I told my students all the time and my kids, you better love.

692
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:36,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry about that other stuff you love.

693
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:39,192
[SPEAKER_06]: But it starts, as my father said, around the dinner table.

694
01:21:41,112 --> 01:21:42,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about love will find a way.

695
01:21:45,714 --> 01:21:46,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to the lyrics.

696
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:53,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you feeling down and lonely?

697
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:58,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Feeling like you just can't go on?

698
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:28,585
[SPEAKER_06]: just remember love will find a way tell me if you're going through changes time seems like it's passing by just believe that love will find a way

699
01:22:33,283 --> 01:22:37,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the tears that you cry.

700
01:22:39,005 --> 01:22:43,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the pain that's in your eyes.

701
01:22:44,647 --> 01:22:54,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So many times you were so lonely and no one seems to care.

702
01:22:56,031 --> 01:22:57,552
[SPEAKER_06]: But if your hopes

703
01:22:58,817 --> 01:23:06,761
[SPEAKER_06]: For your tomorrows are drowning in your sorrows.

704
01:23:07,281 --> 01:23:18,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Know your heart will show you the way.

705
01:23:19,447 --> 01:23:20,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

706
01:23:27,976 --> 01:23:31,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen.

707
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:36,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you trying to find a beginning?

708
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:41,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Or something just to hold on to?

709
01:23:43,984 --> 01:23:48,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Always know that love will find a way.

710
01:23:55,382 --> 01:23:59,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it hard this life you're living?

711
01:24:00,343 --> 01:24:05,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the world seem so unkind, so unkind?

712
01:24:06,225 --> 01:24:11,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you know that love will find a way?

713
01:24:14,947 --> 01:24:19,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Some say we've lost our way.

714
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:24,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Some say the world has gone astray.

715
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:36,004
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you know where you are going, there's nothing you can't do.

716
01:24:36,064 --> 01:24:38,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Because problems will come.

717
01:24:39,805 --> 01:24:41,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they will leave you.

718
01:24:43,326 --> 01:24:47,408
[SPEAKER_06]: The world will try to deceive you.

719
01:24:48,108 --> 01:24:54,450
[SPEAKER_06]: But the truth will always be in your soul.

720
01:24:58,806 --> 01:25:05,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Be in your soul, soul, soul, soul.

721

[SPEAKER_06]: I know they remember the song, Rockin' Robin.

[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any blues lovers here?

792
01:31:59,136 --> 01:32:02,017
[SPEAKER_04]: That was blues, but... Ah, my man.

793
01:32:03,478 --> 01:32:07,399
[SPEAKER_04]: You listen to the blues while you're doing this scientific study, right?

01:32:33,247 --> 01:32:34,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day.

806
01:32:36,087 --> 01:32:38,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day I have the blues.

807
01:32:40,469 --> 01:32:40,909
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

808
01:32:41,269 --> 01:32:45,810
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when you see me worried because, girl, I hate to lose.

809
01:32:47,131 --> 01:32:50,852
[SPEAKER_06]: But listen, I realize that nobody loves me.

810
01:32:52,172 --> 01:32:53,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody seems to care.

811
01:32:55,486 --> 01:32:56,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say that again.

812
01:32:57,026 --> 01:32:59,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody really truly loves me.

813
01:33:00,147 --> 01:33:01,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody seems to care.

814
01:33:01,908 --> 01:33:02,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, this is the blues.

815
01:33:04,289 --> 01:33:09,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of bad luck and trouble, well, you know I've had my share.

816
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:11,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what I'm going to do, Rollins?

817
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:17,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pack my suitcase and move on down the line.

818
01:33:17,513 --> 01:33:18,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Route 16 right over here.

819
01:33:19,861 --> 01:33:25,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm going to pack my suitcase, Lord, move on down the line.

820
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:32,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know that nobody's worried, ain't nobody crying.

821
01:33:36,064 --> 01:33:41,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day, every day I sing the blues.

822
01:33:44,025 --> 01:33:49,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day, every day, every single day, Lord, have mercy, I'll sing the blues.

823
01:33:51,585 --> 01:33:58,206
[SPEAKER_06]: If you really see me worried, it's because I hate to lose.

824
01:33:58,307 --> 01:33:59,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to say one thing.

825
01:33:59,487 --> 01:34:01,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize that nobody loves me.

826
01:34:03,408 --> 01:34:04,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody seems to care.

827
01:34:06,328 --> 01:34:07,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody needs love.

828
01:34:08,289 --> 01:34:10,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that nobody loves me.

829
01:34:11,409 --> 01:34:13,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody seems to care.

830
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:18,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've had my share of bad luck and troubles.

831
01:34:19,725 --> 01:34:20,887
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I have my share.

832
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:22,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Brother, what you gonna do?

833
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:22,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Help me out here.

834
01:34:22,891 --> 01:34:24,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, I got the blues, brother.

835
01:34:25,195 --> 01:34:26,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Tinkle them, tinkle them.

836
01:34:26,758 --> 01:34:29,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Lord have mercy.

837
01:34:57,773 --> 01:34:59,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I hear that train coming.

838
01:34:59,574 --> 01:35:01,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear it.

839
01:35:01,235 --> 01:35:03,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day.

840
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:04,717
Uh-oh.

841
01:35:04,877 --> 01:35:10,881
Every day I sing the blues.

842
01:35:11,161 --> 01:35:11,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day.

843
01:35:14,103 --> 01:35:15,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day I sing the blues.

844
01:35:27,062 --> 01:35:29,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I furtured my baby.

845
01:35:30,743 --> 01:35:33,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got the blues.

846
01:35:34,784 --> 01:35:36,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about I've got the blues.

847
01:35:36,785 --> 01:35:39,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Baby, I've got the blues.

848
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:42,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish things would change, but I just don't think they're ever going to change.

849
01:35:42,606 --> 01:35:44,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to move on down the line.

850
01:35:44,767 --> 01:35:48,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hope I don't get hit by that choo-choo train.

851
01:35:48,268 --> 01:35:48,888
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?

852
01:35:50,068 --> 01:35:50,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

853
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:53,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I won't be in trouble.

854
01:35:54,053 --> 01:35:57,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I ain't got nothing to lose.

855
01:35:57,475 --> 01:35:58,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

856
01:35:59,316 --> 01:36:00,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

857
01:36:00,897 --> 01:36:01,317
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

858
01:36:01,337 --> 01:36:08,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

859
01:36:16,525 --> 01:36:21,948
[SPEAKER_06]: The great Marvin Gaye wrote this song, and he was way ahead of his time because he was

860
01:36:23,371 --> 01:36:25,232
[SPEAKER_06]: asking the same question that I ask every day.

861
01:36:25,252 --> 01:36:38,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Mother, mother, there's far too many of you crying.

862
01:36:39,159 --> 01:36:46,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Brother, brother, brother, there's far too many of you dying.

863
01:36:47,703 --> 01:36:50,965
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we've got to find a way.

864
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:59,030
[SPEAKER_03]: to bring some loving here today.

865
01:37:00,931 --> 01:37:07,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Father, Father, we don't need to escalate.

866
01:37:10,436 --> 01:37:18,840
[SPEAKER_06]: War is not the answer, for only love conquers hate.

867
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:22,662
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we've got to find a way.

868
01:37:24,904 --> 01:37:30,707
[SPEAKER_06]: to bring some loving here today.

869
01:37:31,247 --> 01:37:38,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Picket lines, picket signs, don't you punish me.

870
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:47,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Brutality, talk to me so you can see what's going on.

871
01:37:49,338 --> 01:37:51,702
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?

872
01:37:51,943 --> 01:37:54,286
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?

873
01:37:54,547 --> 01:37:56,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know what's going on.

874
01:38:20,578 --> 01:38:21,739
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on, y'all?

875
01:38:25,241 --> 01:38:27,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey.

876
01:38:28,824 --> 01:38:31,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother, mother, mother, mother, mother.

877
01:38:33,107 --> 01:38:37,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody thinks that we're wrong.

878
01:38:38,290 --> 01:38:38,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh.

879
01:38:39,711 --> 01:38:45,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they to judge us simply because our hair is long?

880
01:38:47,822 --> 01:38:58,007
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we've got to find a way to bring some loving here today.

881
01:39:00,028 --> 01:39:09,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Picket lines, picket signs, just don't punish me with your brutality.

882
01:39:09,953 --> 01:39:14,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, talk to me so you can see.

883
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,800
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?

884
01:39:18,281 --> 01:39:20,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, yeah.

885
01:39:20,841 --> 01:39:22,762
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?

886
01:39:23,462 --> 01:39:24,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey.

887
01:39:24,662 --> 01:39:25,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep it right there.

888
01:39:26,143 --> 01:39:27,383
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?

889
01:39:28,783 --> 01:39:32,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody tell me what's going on.

890
01:39:33,905 --> 01:39:34,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know.

891
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:37,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to know what's going on.

892
01:39:39,656 --> 01:39:45,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, what's going on?

893
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:53,922
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on, y'all?

894
01:39:58,544 --> 01:40:02,266
[SPEAKER_06]: The late, great Bobby Caldwell sang some great songs.

895
01:40:02,286 --> 01:40:04,226
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people thought he was a brother.

896
01:40:06,587 --> 01:40:07,828
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how soulful he was.

897
01:40:09,252 --> 01:40:12,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Eyes Soul, one of his favorite songs.

898
01:40:16,998 --> 01:40:25,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess you wonder where I've been, search to find the love within.

899
01:40:28,467 --> 01:40:36,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I came back to let you know, got a thing for you, and I can't let it go.

900
01:40:39,807 --> 01:40:42,948
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends wonder what is wrong with me.

901
01:40:44,209 --> 01:40:48,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see.

902
01:40:50,971 --> 01:40:53,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I came back to let you know.

903
01:40:55,332 --> 01:40:58,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a thing for you, and I can't let it go.

904
01:40:59,474 --> 01:40:59,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen.

905
01:41:01,531 --> 01:41:10,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people go around the world for love, but they may never find what they dreamed of.

906
01:41:11,134 --> 01:41:16,476
[SPEAKER_06]: What you won't do, do for love.

907
01:41:16,916 --> 01:41:21,797
[SPEAKER_06]: You tried everything, but you won't give up.

908
01:41:22,638 --> 01:41:29,900
[SPEAKER_06]: In my world, only you make me do for love.

909
01:41:30,603 --> 01:41:34,346
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would not do.

910
01:41:35,166 --> 01:41:38,268
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends wonder what is wrong with me.

911
01:41:39,609 --> 01:41:43,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see.

912
01:41:46,394 --> 01:41:48,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I came back to let you know.

913
01:41:50,697 --> 01:41:52,078
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do fall in love.

914
01:41:52,718 --> 01:41:54,299
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would not do.

915
01:41:54,759 --> 01:41:55,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Ross.

916
01:42:07,638 --> 01:42:08,103
Mm-hmm.

917
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:42,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen.

918
01:42:43,182 --> 01:42:46,385
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends wonder what is wrong with me.

919
01:42:47,826 --> 01:43:02,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, amid the days, in the days, in the days with your love, you see, I came back to let you know, Lord, I got a thing for you, and I can't let it go.

920
01:43:05,899 --> 01:43:09,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And though I only want the best, it's true.

921
01:43:09,781 --> 01:43:15,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe the things I do for you.

922
01:43:15,944 --> 01:43:25,349
[SPEAKER_05]: What you want to do for love, you tried everything, but it don't give up.

923
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:30,812
[SPEAKER_05]: In my world, only you.

924
01:43:35,047 --> 01:43:36,267
And I would not do.

925
01:43:37,808 --> 01:43:38,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

926
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:42,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Caldwell, The Late Great.

927
01:43:43,111 --> 01:43:43,651
Let me see.

928
01:43:43,751 --> 01:43:49,995
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

929
01:43:52,916 --> 01:43:54,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is one you all remember.

930
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:01,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Fly Me to the Moon.

931
01:44:02,882 --> 01:44:03,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic.

932
01:44:08,723 --> 01:44:11,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Fly me to the moon.

933
01:44:12,124 --> 01:44:15,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me sing among the stars.

934
01:44:17,226 --> 01:44:24,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars.

935
01:44:24,789 --> 01:44:29,391
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, hold my hand.

936
01:44:32,592 --> 01:44:37,114
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, baby, kiss me.

937
01:44:40,748 --> 01:44:43,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Fill my heart with song.

938
01:44:44,071 --> 01:44:47,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me sing forevermore.

939
01:44:49,196 --> 01:44:56,162
[SPEAKER_06]: You are all I worship, all I worship and adore.

940
01:44:56,623 --> 01:45:02,268
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, please be true.

941
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:05,451
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words,

942
01:45:07,723 --> 01:45:08,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you.

943
01:45:08,903 --> 01:45:10,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Bryce, throw.

944
01:45:10,384 --> 01:45:12,444
[SPEAKER_06]: What you going to do?

945
01:45:12,624 --> 01:45:12,764
Hey!

946
01:45:44,199 --> 01:45:46,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fill my heart with song.

947
01:45:48,002 --> 01:45:51,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me sing forevermore.

948
01:45:53,026 --> 01:46:00,051
[SPEAKER_06]: You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.

949
01:46:00,391 --> 01:46:06,215
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, please be true.

950
01:46:07,476 --> 01:46:09,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, in other words.

951
01:46:11,753 --> 01:46:20,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, in other words, baby, in other words, I love you.

952
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:24,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

953
01:46:27,342 --> 01:46:28,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

954
01:46:28,503 --> 01:46:34,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell my wife every day, I love you, even though I drive her crazy.

955
01:46:34,426 --> 01:46:36,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.

956
01:46:37,988 --> 01:46:39,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

957
01:46:43,602 --> 01:46:44,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, great songs.

958
01:46:51,684 --> 01:46:53,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the church down there is the Shiloh.

959
01:46:55,285 --> 01:46:57,305
[SPEAKER_06]: That church was there for many, many years, correct?

960
01:46:57,325 --> 01:47:00,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's still two different locations.

961
01:47:02,687 --> 01:47:11,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to do a sort of a gospel-y song, but you know this.

962
01:47:21,717 --> 01:47:22,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they're going to sing along.

963
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:24,561
[SPEAKER_06]: You know this one.

964
01:47:24,721 --> 01:47:26,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, happy day.

965
01:47:27,284 --> 01:47:28,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want you to sing along for this one.

966
01:47:28,965 --> 01:47:29,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

967
01:47:50,509 --> 01:47:51,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, y'all.

968
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:54,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, happy day.

969
01:47:55,092 --> 01:47:56,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, happy day.

970
01:47:56,433 --> 01:47:59,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, happy day.

971
01:48:02,737 --> 01:48:04,658
[SPEAKER_06]: When Jesus walked.

972
01:48:04,778 --> 01:48:05,599
[SPEAKER_06]: When Jesus walked.

973
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, when he walked.

974
01:48:09,421 --> 01:48:10,662
When he walked.

975
01:48:11,923 --> 01:48:13,704
[SPEAKER_06]: When Jesus walked.

976
01:48:15,365 --> 01:48:17,487
[SPEAKER_06]: He washed my sins away.

977
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, such a happy day.

978
01:48:23,301 --> 01:48:24,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say it again.

979
01:48:24,042 --> 01:48:26,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, happy day.

980
01:48:30,105 --> 01:48:31,926
