    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=0.009s">table</a>  on my left. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2.13s">I've</a>  had the good fortune of working over the last few months with one of my favorite local agencies, the Mystic River Watershed Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=11.794s">And</a>  they've supported a number of recent community center outreach programs, and they are one of the busiest organizations in the area whose mission is based in conservation, recreation, and restoration of our local waterways. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=28.789s">So</a>  tonight, we have a few of their leaders here to talk about the special work they have planned for the summer, and in particular, about a forward-looking initiative called the Mystic Lakes Pathway Improvement Project that they're hoping to bring to a stretch of the river, just a stone's throw away from where we sit. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=50.387s">Our</a>  guests for this portion of the evening's program are friends, and they certainly have a great story to tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=57.373s">Let</a>  me first reintroduce to you the executive director of MIRA, Mystic River Watershed Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=65.401s">That's</a>  my friend Patrick Herron. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=67.463s">He's</a>  been at the helm of the agency since September of 2016, and he leads the overall vision of the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=75.771s">He</a>  manages the finances and the board of directors, and we know what that's like. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=79.975s">He</a>  joined MIRA as the Water Quality Monitoring Director in 2009 and became Deputy Director in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=88.124s">During</a>  his tenure with the organization, Patrick has worked with the staff to initiate many new programs for the association, including water chestnut or invasive species removal, <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=101.378s">River</a>  herring monitoring, that's really a key clue to the health of the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=107.981s">Mystic</a>  Greenways and waterfront restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=111.243s">During</a>  his time at the association, he has written and managed many of the grants that have underpinned this work and established collaborations across the watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=121.667s">There's</a>  more to say, but I'll leave it right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=124.989s">Suffice</a>  it to say that he's a busy man running a very important organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=130.311s">Joining</a>  Patrick at the table is Carl Alexander. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=133.974s">Carl</a>  is charged with leading all aspects of the aforementioned Mystic Greenways program, working alongside a dynamic, collaborative team on the community-led design of park and shared-use path projects along the watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=149.486s">Most</a>  recently, Carl served as an urban planning and design consultant for open space and greenways, mobility and placemaking projects in the greater Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=159.933s">A</a>  few of the highlights of which include the Mary Ellen Welch Greenway in East Boston, the Airwife Linear Park in Cambridge, and the Neighborways Program in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=170.761s">He</a>  has a BA in politics from Bates. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=173.203s">Bates</a>  is a good school up there in Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=175.524s">Up</a>  there in Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=176.565s">and</a>  an MS in urban planning and community development from down here at UMass Boston School for the Environment, resident of East Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=184.47s">In</a>  his spare time, he enjoys cooking, gardening, and hiking. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=187.072s">I</a>  didn't know this about you, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=188.994s">So</a>  as is my custom in beginning these evenings we share, I would like to offer a bit of verse to get us thinking about the themes of equity, history, accessibility that we'll be talking about for the next little while. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=204.064s">This</a>  piece is called <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=207.6s">A</a>  river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=211.584s">Our</a>  valley is a place of legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=213.967s">Monuments</a>  of wood and bronze and stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=216.55s">Stories</a>  we tell and make our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=218.732s">Colonial</a>  towns that stand the test of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=221.355s">Old</a>  graveyards that reckon our lost prime. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=224.879s">Thoughts</a>  that bring a poet to a rhyme. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=227.922s">And</a>  a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=230.024s">Our</a>  valley is a place of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=231.945s">Heroes</a>  that fought in foreign wars. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=234.466s">Army,</a>  Navy, Air Force, and the Corps. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=236.906s">Pride</a>  and service that extends their tours. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=239.587s">Courage</a>  seeping, sweating through their pores. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=242.048s">Death</a>  and loss that bravery ignores. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=245.229s">And</a>  the river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=247.49s">Our</a>  valley is a place of misery, native kindness lost in exploitation, liberties for some through subjugation, faith distortions used to build a nation, confinements to the distant reservation, hopeful spirits lost at every station, museum cases filled with infiltration, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=269.022s">Our</a>  valley is a place of shame, treaties that were violated, tribes that were decimated, disease that was initiated, environment that was devastated, trust that was annihilated, greed that still is celebrated, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=285.496s">Our</a>  valley is a place of industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=288.338s">Iron</a>  was smelted. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=289.399s">Tallow</a>  was melted. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=290.44s">Chips</a>  were built. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=291.26s">Frames</a>  were gilt. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=292.501s">Leather</a>  was tanned. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=293.422s">Bridges</a>  were spanned. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=294.523s">Fabric</a>  was dyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=295.684s">Fish</a>  was fried. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=297.005s">Rum</a>  was distilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=298.165s">Barrels</a>  were filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=299.426s">Glass</a>  was blown. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=300.407s">Crops</a>  were grown. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=301.588s">Metal</a>  was stamped. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=302.529s">Soldiers</a>  encamped. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=304.07s">Milk</a>  was homogenized, pasteurized, and fortified. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=307.832s">And</a>  a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=310.274s">Our</a>  valley is a place of injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=313.138s">Lies</a>  were told as papers passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=315.621s">Covenants</a>  never intended to last. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=317.924s">Stolen</a>  lands, great wealth amassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=319.846s">Rampant</a>  correction now put on blast. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=322.229s">How</a>  did it get so bad so fast? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=325.253s">There's</a>  silent guilt that sanitizes, race unrest that paralyzes, black lives trying to matter, brown skin made to scatter, red blood spilled and splattered, homes that only sell to some, banks don't lend to everyone, police don't look to serve and protect, fear and loathing breed disrespect, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=347.518s">Our</a>  valley is still a place of denial, for graves undug to drive a pile. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=352.343s">The</a>  landed gentry remains on trial for sins committed in the church's aisle. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=357.327s">And</a>  failure to turn equality's dial for actions thought both vain and vile, no small amount of desecration where progress in turn the bones of First Nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=367.276s">with</a>  never a notion toward real preservation and a headlong rush toward contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=374.284s">Where</a>  is Missituk's compensation? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=377.188s">Are</a>  bluebacks and herring a standing ovation? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=379.771s">The</a>  watches gather around the formation and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=385.357s">Our</a>  valley is a place of nativity, indigenous braves or slaves in captivity, immigrant enclaves in exclusivity, a treacherous path to beloved community. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=395.185s">Each</a>  clan wears a kindred face, covets a homeland's warm embrace, competing gospels of time and space, every religion and every race, tribal spirits of fire and ice, a thousand types of beans and rice, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=413.308s">Our</a>  valley is a place of fertility, verdant shores by the sandy beaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=418.211s">Nature</a>  grows with the soul beseeches. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=421.993s">Ash</a>  and elm and maple preaches from the silent spring to the epic speeches. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=428.537s">Yet</a>  poison into the soil leeches, open wounds and ugly breeches. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=433.139s">We've</a>  yet to learn what nature teaches, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=439.517s">Our</a>  valley is a tapestry, threads for every color and shade, stripes for every soul displayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=446.847s">Winter</a>  and spring, summer and fall, translucent rain that showers all. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=451.653s">Rainbows</a>  await the heart's desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=454.657s">Together</a>  we face the cleansing fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=457.68s">Families</a>  grow strong with true resilience. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=460.382s">School</a>  invests in each child's brilliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=463.625s">God's</a>  design put the scales in balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=466.688s">Each</a>  one brings their gifts and talents. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=469.21s">Neighbors</a>  embrace a common will despite the screeching fool on the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=473.514s">Poems</a>  are written that resonate still, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=480.046s">Our</a>  valley is a place of vibrancy that takes great pride in its energy, that seeks out moments of synergy, that wraps its models in honesty, that guides its resources zealously, that seeks its level with urgency, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=498.693s">Our</a>  place is a place of true rebirth, as we try to protect our precious earth, where good people meet to set things right, and the cleanup ensues through the waning light, and then the party takes over the night, and the food and the music is out of sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=515.462s">We</a>  gather our kin at the father's shore, and labor together to open the door, and a river runs through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=525.266s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=526.507s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=529.614s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=530.535s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=530.895s">So,</a>  Patrick, I want to start with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=533.598s">For</a>  the folks that may not be familiar with what you do, can you talk a bit about the overall work of your organization, the communities you serve, and what drew you to the occupation?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=548.723s">It'd</a>  be a pleasure, but before I do, let me just say that while the Mystic River is a glorious river, it is a humble river, and I can't think of another river around that has been so flattered with words like your poetry on this river. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=563.269s">I</a>  don't think the Hudson River has poetry about it, or the Connecticut River, or the Saugus or the Nepenthe, so I think we're really grateful that you've made this a work of art for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=577.879s">Our</a>  organization is trying to create a healthy Mystic River watershed, and that has a lot of different meanings. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=584.163s">It</a>  has meanings from the ecological sense, but also from the sense of all of us as residents of this watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=590.767s">We're</a>  trying to create a place. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=594.029s">And</a>  this organization started in 1972 and really had as its focus <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=600.413s">the</a>  water quality for real concerns about the history of industry and the impact it was having. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=607.94s">And</a>  I think we've really expanded to think more about the presence of all of us as people as really important denizens of this watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=616.829s">And</a>  we need to do the work to make sure it's healthy for us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=620.652s">And</a>  so the work of our organization really covers a lot of ground now. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=624.873s">We</a>  are still focused very much on water quality and fish. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=629.595s">We're</a>  also focused on recreation and active transportation routes through the Domestic Greenways Program, which Carl will share more about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=638.598s">We</a>  do a lot of work on climate resiliency in partnership with our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=643.099s">to</a>  try to leverage the money that's going into creating protections against climate to make sure they're directed at creating healthier communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=652.442s">We</a>  do environmental education as a big part of our work, and we center environmental justice and equity in our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=661.545s">that</a>  a big part of our work is to make sure that we are directing our resources and our capacity as a staff to addressing the pollution where it's most severe, where conditions are furthest behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=675.797s">And</a>  so that's also a piece of work that we probably didn't have a word for in the 1970s, that I think we are more fluid in terms of how we talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=687.126s">We</a>  serve 21 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=688.948s">It's</a>  a small watershed, but it's 21 communities, and that's one of our challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=693.751s">So</a>  all the way from Reading and Burlington, down through Winchester and Arlington and Medford and Somerville, and down past Everett and into Boston Harbor where Chelsea and East Boston and Charlestown and Revere and Winthrop. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=707.601s">Those</a>  are all communities that we're focused on and working in partnership with residents and other community-based organizations and the state and regulators. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=717.066s">We're</a>  a very collaborative organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=719.367s">We're</a>  very rarely out there to get anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=721.908s">Instead,</a>  we're inviting them into the room to try to work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=725.971s">We</a>  start with the assumption that everybody really wants a healthy place for all of us to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=732.874s">And</a>  how I got into this work, I came from academia, and I was just really excited about seeing science applied in partnership with community. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=745.699s">And</a>  this is an organization that really tries to hold credible science and viewpoints that are informed by <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=754.122s">Data,</a>  data that we gather from water bottles, data we gather from engaging directly with residents to understand concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=762.346s">So</a>  I guess there's one more piece of work we've started to do recently is on air quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=768.089s">Just</a>  for this reason that we believe that air quality supports healthy people, it's really clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=775.993s">And</a>  we've got a really interesting watershed with a lot of industrial areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=781.295s">Let's</a>  try to understand what those conditions are to see if we can mitigate those pollution sources and help people live healthy lives.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=789.401s">Fantastic,</a>  fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=790.882s">That</a>  explains a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=792.743s">Carl,</a>  if you don't mind, can you kind of do the same with regard to the greenways programs you oversee and bring us into the discussion of the prospective Mystic Lakes pathway initiative? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=805.111s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=805.951s">Terry,</a>  thank you so much for having us again here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=809.553s">The</a>  Mystic Greenways program started in 2016, so we're approaching 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=818.035s">And</a>  its vision is to connect 25 miles of paths and parks throughout the Mystic River watershed and its tributaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=829.799s">Our</a>  watershed is the most highly urbanized watershed in New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=832.802s">It</a>  carries the brunt of very heavy industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=836.384s">And</a>  it's very densely populated. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=838.306s">And</a>  so as a result of all of those factors, we don't have a lot of open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=842.489s">And</a>  so providing linear spaces, linear corridors that connect to these larger parks and connect into communities, you're able to create a network of open spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=852.858s">So</a>  you often hear, oh, 15 minutes walk to a park. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=857.762s">Maybe</a>  you might hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=859.683s">And</a>  from here there, but it's it's a really exciting job where we get to Steward and lead on several projects we get to help catalyze Certain parks and pathway projects and others were you know, we're standing with community members advocating for them or advocating for you know Agencies like DCR or cities to to better take care of their open spaces as well and <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=886.123s">So,</a>  it really runs the gambit. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=889.046s">And,</a>  you know, as part of our vision of 25 miles of connected paths and parks, you know, we rely on, you know, really solid planning processes to help identify projects that can make the greatest impact for residents of the watershed and the region at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=906.398s">And</a>  just on the eastern shoreline of the, of the mystic lakes here has incredible history, you know, dating back to pre contact pre colonial contact it was a, you know, very, you know, highly utilized, you know, space for indigenous communities to fish into. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=926.967s">really,</a>  really thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=929.427s">And</a>  over time, as colonization took effect, it was heavily used for industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=936.789s">You</a>  have the Middlesex Canal that ran from Lowell to Boston Harbor, right along Mystic Valley Parkway on the eastern shoreline of the lakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=946.932s">And</a>  then, you know, fast forward, Frederick L. Olmsted and his partner, Charles Elliott, they are the landscape designers who designed Boston Common and Central Park and many of America's parks that you see today, really saw a lot of public value in this space and designed a parkway, which at the time did not include cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=972.08s">speeding</a>  40 to 60 miles an hour it was you know carriages and people walking and they even thought Yeah, it's a you know moving moving more than five miles an hour was considered a little bit too fast for that space and so You know, all of these things are leading up to what you see today at Mystic Valley Parkway and <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=995.249s">And</a>  some improvements have been made to the shoreline over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=998.492s">Recent</a>  improvements up at Shannon Beach with a new bath house is very, very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1004.397s">In</a>  the town of Winchester, there was a small improvements project to add a sidewalk and some parking areas and some nice decorative lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1015.466s">But</a>  as soon as you hit the Medford border, it goes into an unimproved, not accessible <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1023.632s">dirt</a>  path Going all the way to the high street rotaries which are inherently dangerous as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1029.475s">And</a>  so You know, they haven't the space hasn't been looked at in decades, but that doesn't mean people haven't used this space people have made this space their own and really appreciate it for the hiking nature of its of its feel and people walk their dogs, you know as Maybe perhaps you do <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1048.643s">Each</a>  and every day and really treat it as a valued resource in the neighborhood And and so really our goal is to take everyone's ideas with this project the Massachusetts Department of Conservation Recreation has identified this as a parkway to improve and make safer and more accessible and <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1069.522s">And</a>  as a result, came to us and said, would you like to help kick off this process? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1074.963s">We</a>  have some greater capacity and partnerships to help gather ideas from folks about what they would like to see for the shoreline. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1083.867s">And</a>  at the same exact time, they're working on a safety improvement project for the rotaries as well right here, and put in crossing for pedestrians to make it a safer, modernized roundabout. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1098.251s">And</a>  so combine all of this together and you're really helping to advance the regional network for safe mobility, for recreation, or just going from A to B, or staying. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1113.817s">There's</a>  so many opportunities for improving the amenities that folks can enjoy along this stretch as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1122.601s">So</a>  that's kind of how we came to be, and it's an exciting part of the larger Mystic Greenways vision.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1131.049s">Very</a>  good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1133.592s">I've</a>  had the good fortune of serving on a steering committee that's discussing this Mystic Lakes pathway project. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1147.308s">I</a>  think the focus and the drive to get people to see a vision has been outstanding and we'll talk a little bit more about that, but I want to come back to Patrick because <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1164.306s">You're</a>  not a state agency, you're not a city agency, so can you kind of describe your funding and how it fits into the larger scheme of municipalities and communities that you serve?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1186.477s">That's</a>  such an interesting question, because we're a people's agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1191.879s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1192.3s">I</a>  think the hope is that we are driven by community desires and ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1200.103s">And</a>  that helps make us who we are, whether it's folks on the steering committee or folks that we recruit to join our board and give direction to us as a staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1211.488s">The</a>  goal is we're serving the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1213.91s">So</a>  we are a nonprofit, and we have to raise funding to hire staff to hopefully serve the community interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1221.676s">And</a>  we try to turn over every rock there is to find funding, both to <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1229.122s">make</a>  sure we have staff to do this work, but also to actually build the project sometimes or design the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1234.305s">So</a>  we are, a lot of our funding comes directly from community members who will send us in a check once a year and say, look, this is the work that I want to see happen in my community. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1245.79s">And</a>  I think we think you're catalyzing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1249.391s">We</a>  also reach out to state agencies and federal agencies and apply for grants because a lot of the goals we have here in the MISTIC and that our community members have are shared by these agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1262.182s">And</a>  we also reach out to foundations and corporations who want to be associated with this work because they share our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1271.03s">Whether</a>  it's around a healthy environment, whether it's centering equity, that's what we do as an organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1278.239s">We</a>  try to act on those values that are informed by residents in the community.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1285.187s">Excellent,</a>  excellent, excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1289.191s">Carl,</a>  I would like to have you, if you would, talk a little bit about the community outreach component that has kind of advanced the discussion of the pathway project and where you are now with that aspect of the initiative.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1303.067s">Yeah,</a>  so once we received our funding for the project, it was the Mass Trails State Program with some match funding from the Solomon Foundation, we set off to kind of lay out our process for community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1318.912s">You</a>  know, looking at just the eastern shoreline of the Mystic Lakes, it's a part of, you know, such a valuable asset for, you know, Medford residents, Winchester residents in the region at large, and so we knew <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1331.455s">It's</a>  it's a very valuable asset people, you know, really really cherish it and it's also You know, it's not just the parkway It's the these peninsulas that kind of jut out into the lakes that are overgrown with you know Invasive species and their shoreline erosion and then as you go south of High Street this you know have the same, you know problem with the shoreline here as well and there's a <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1355.928s">On</a>  this side, there's no path that someone with a wheelchair might, for example, be able to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1363.395s">So</a>  we knew that this is just the start of the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1367.419s">And</a>  so we wanted residents in the room at each and every step. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1372.883s">And</a>  so from the outset, we sought to convene a steering committee of residents who expressed an interest in being involved in the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1383.052s">We</a>  received over 45 applications from folks in the area, and we ended up selecting 10 residents that we feel have been great to collaborate with and receive guidance on from the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1403.258s">We've</a>  had the opportunity to, you know, meet with them in a more formal setting three times now. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1409.964s">However,</a>  we've done some site walks and, you know, and they've helped to table at recent community events as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1420.834s">So,</a>  and Terry is on the steering committee, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1425.898s">And</a>  then we also have Simon here this evening who's on the steering committee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1431.263s">But</a>  you really as a guiding hand, see the steering committee as a guiding hand in our work and also our engagement strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1440.396s">Because</a>  it is a large project, we wanted to make sure that the meetings that we're holding publicly <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1448.707s">for</a>  residents, and we've hosted three to date so far, or two to date, and our third public meeting for this round of work is this coming Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1459.179s">There's</a>  information on the table that you can receive in order to kind of see our refined design concepts for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1467.889s">However,</a>  we started that process in the very first public meeting with a initial visioning phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1477.194s">So</a>  we really asked folks for their hopes and dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1480.156s">What</a>  do you currently like about the shoreline in Mystic Valley Parkway there along Mystic Lakes? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1488.22s">What</a>  don't you currently like? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1490.101s">What</a>  would you like to see that's not currently there? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1492.202s">And</a>  what do you think we should avoid? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1494.184s">And</a>  we received over 1,200 unique comments from members of the public that we were able to really package up and summarize for our design team to start to get to work on some initial ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1507.639s">We</a>  then came back for our second round of engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1511.064s">The</a>  first round was in February, second round was in the beginning of April, where we presented three initial ideas that had a mix and match of different themes and strategies for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1522.399s">And</a>  we asked for folks' preferences and additional ideas and thoughts on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1527.946s">Shook</a>  that up and now we're at our third phase of the work that we're doing in this stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1535.493s">We</a>  want to have the opportunity to speak with residents in each and every stage and really appreciate the steering committee for lending a guiding hand through that process.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1546.708s">It's</a>  been a very, very constructive conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1551.532s">And</a>  I think if folks might avail themselves of the opportunity to attend the third public meeting, they'd get a real good sense of overall how we came to some conclusions. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1568.088s">And</a>  that's fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1570.37s">OK,</a>  so Patrick, you kind of have a 10,000 foot vision on everything that's going on in the watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1582.461s">Can</a>  you share a few thoughts about, from what you've seen in the science that you've seen, the work that your folks are doing, how climate change is impacting the watershed, both from a science perspective and a people aspect?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1599.781s">I</a>  think it's a prescient comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1604.603s">I</a>  feel like we're living in a climate-impacted watershed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1608.985s">I</a>  think for a long time we had this language of, well, we have to be ready for 2030. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1613.127s">Well,</a>  we have to be ready for 2070. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1616.548s">Gosh,</a>  we've got to be ready for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1620.253s">We</a>  are experiencing really intense rainfall events, and that's unusual weather patterns. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1627.561s">We</a>  are going to experience periods of drought that we won't expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1633.516s">And</a>  we're experiencing sometimes very hot temperatures that will impact some of our residents more than others for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1644.264s">And</a>  so how does this translate into what we see on the ground here in the watershed? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1649.689s">Well,</a>  first of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1652.924s">When</a>  we see rain coming in really big bunches like we do, and we've got a bunch of rain already this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1658.666s">We</a>  had a bunch last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1660.086s">Our</a>  infrastructure can't hold it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1664.947s">So</a>  that water is overrunning our sewer systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1667.608s">And</a>  we're actually dumping raw sewage into Alewife Brook and to the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1672.929s">And</a>  so on one side, we're like, oh, come recreate on the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1676.77s">But</a>  then we have to tell you on Tuesday <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1680.152s">5</a>  million gallons of sewage went down the river because our infrastructure wasn't big enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1685.076s">It</a>  wasn't big enough for now, let alone 2030 or 2070. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1688.899s">So</a>  there's a tremendous investment that needs to be made to protect this resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1694.284s">And</a>  in terms of temperatures, as we get warmer and warmer, <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1698.087s">It's</a>  really clear that our communities in leafy suburbs and well air-conditioned homes, I think they're going to be okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1707.573s">I</a>  think that communities that are living in rental properties or lower income, they are typically living on streets with less trees, in homes that may not have air conditioning, or just turning on the air conditioning may be a big investment for them in terms of their bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1726.845s">So,</a>  HEAT's going to begin impacting people, both their public health as well as their pocketbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1734.011s">So,</a>  what do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1735.272s">And</a>  I think the thing we're trying to do is to shine a light on this problem and get the state to prioritize some of these investments and infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1745.18s">We're</a>  working with many of our municipalities here and the state to plant more trees in communities with less trees, and really work with residents to find out what kind of trees they want and where they want trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1756.59s">In</a>  Medford, we're working with some great groups to actually give people trees they can plant in their own backyard if they want as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1762.915s">So,</a>  yeah, it's happening right now, Terry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1767.598s">Carl,</a>  I want to ask you about, you've been kind of bringing these new infrastructure and environmental projects to the public forum, not only with this project, but others that you've been helping to lead for a number of years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1786.474s">What</a>  kinds of things that you've learned are kind of really surprising to you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1797.065s">Well,</a>  I think I think to dovetail off of what Patrick said it's it's like creating spaces for that work, not like for now, and help us now not only 30 years from now, has been really eye opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1812.665s">You</a>  know, it's these, you know, spaces that are going to provide really strong respite from heat, even though you might live in a heat island area or you live in an area with a lot of asphalt and no tree cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1825.493s">We</a>  are leading a project in Charlestown on the Little Mystic Channel, which is, you know, underneath the Tobin Bridge, essentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1835.039s">And</a>  it's a census tract that's a hundred percent, you know, low moderate income housing and we're creating a nice cool shaded plaza right next to affordable housing complex using Community Preservation Act funding and some funding from our private foundations who we work with as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1855.229s">And</a>  it's a quick project. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1856.45s">It</a>  was a you know fast design project. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1858.512s">We</a>  we largely engaged the residents of the public housing immediately adjacent and Got to work where we're gonna break ground and next month and it's gonna be done by the spring and we started that process last summer so it's <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1873.906s">So</a>  fast in an infrastructure sense, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1876.868s">I</a>  think that's the biggest surprising thing is these projects do take a long time and there's a lot of regulation involved and a lot of public process that should be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1886.613s">And</a>  I think what does surprise me though is I think we've come a long way, or I hope so, in terms of the way that infrastructure projects are done. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1898.198s">You</a>  know, a lot of recent memory, you know, dating back 40, 50 years where highways are going through communities and never, I never had to say when I had to leave my house or received a notice of the taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1910.045s">And</a>  I think nowadays it's a lot more, it's a lot more collaborative, it's a lot more engaging, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1916.769s">But</a>  in terms of the projects, it's really hearing about the passion of folks who are really excited to see improvements in their own backyard and have the opportunity to help make it a reality is really exciting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1928.895s">As</a>  we've been sitting and having these public meetings and having meetings of the steering committee, I think what's been illuminating to me is the notion that there's a lot of different kinds of people that use these resources in a lot of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1948.039s">And</a>  when you build something that works for <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1953.46s">these</a>  folks, but you don't take these folks into consideration, there can be a lot of hurt in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1961.647s">And</a>  I think one of the things that has been really good about, and Patrick and I were talking about it earlier, about the steering committee, is you thought about handicapped access. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1973.197s">You've</a>  thought about folks potentially in wheelchairs or walking with canes. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1977.658s">You've</a>  also thought about people that have dogs and folks that need to be able to avoid bicycles and avoid these new e-bikes and scooters and all manners of other contraptions that are out there that they have to share the road with. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=1998.423s">And</a>  that's been illuminating to me is that <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2003.064s">We</a>  use these resources in a lot of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2006.728s">And</a>  so you can't be monolithic in your thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2009.211s">You</a>  really have to be more expansive. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2011.614s">And</a>  bringing all these different kinds of folks to the table has led to a real rich discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2018.081s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2018.601s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2019.082s">Very</a>  rich. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2021.44s">Okay,</a>  so you're in a new organizational home now in 23 Maple Street in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2029.162s">Talk</a>  about how that all came about. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2031.482s">I</a>  just got a chance to visit it recently.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2034.083s">Well,</a>  yeah, thank you for highlighting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2035.663s">It's</a>  been long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2036.623s">We've</a>  been in the town of Arlington for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2040.504s">To</a>  their credit, the town of Arlington a long time ago gave us a tiny little office space when we had one staff person and said, you know what, you can just have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2050.146s">And</a>  we grew to two staff and three staff, and we had to come and say, well, there's a closet over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2056.07s">Do</a>  you think we could use that closet? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2057.331s">And</a>  they were like, fine, you can use that closet. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2059.332s">And</a>  eventually, we outgrew the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2061.573s">And</a>  they were really generous. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2063.855s">We</a>  ended up paying for that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2065.315s">And</a>  we were really struggling to find a new home. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2068.277s">We</a>  looked in Malden, and we're pretty close. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2071.019s">We</a>  were really excited about getting on the Orange Line, which was right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2073.881s">It</a>  didn't work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2076.222s">A</a>  building that was right next door to our building, which is about four times larger space, opened up, and we've had the chance to improve the floors, paint the walls, and welcome our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2090.487s">It</a>  has enough space for a team of about 19 people now, and we've got five summer fellows there with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2098.729s">I</a>  don't know, the work really comes alive when you've got that number of people all working, young to older people like myself, all in the same building and in a productive space. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2109.122s">And</a>  so it is really exciting and hopefully it's like the next chapter of the organization or that next rung that lets us reach up a little higher with our work.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2117.539s">It's</a>  interesting because the community center here, from the street, this looks like a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2124.723s">And</a>  your building, it must have been somebody's residence at some point in time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2131.086s">That's</a>  right, a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2131.966s">And</a>  what will make it even a better home is to get Terry's poem, A River Runs Through It, on one of our walls inside the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2140.351s">So</a>  we still have to work that out, but that will make it feel like a home, quite frankly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2145.493s">Yeah,</a>  well, that's nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2147.374s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2147.874s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2149.155s">It's</a>  a third public meeting on the Mystic Lakes pathway project, and you mentioned it, but I'd like to have you mention it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2160.601s">It's</a>  happening next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2164.463s">Can</a>  you tell folks what will be discussed and how they can be included?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2168.7s">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2169.28s">The</a>  third public meeting, it's being held online on Zoom this coming Tuesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2175.963s">There</a>  are pros and cons to in-person versus online. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2179.584s">We've</a>  been able to, I think, reach a broader, a lot more people online, which has been good. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2186.146s">But</a>  I'm happy to talk about the project and the meeting in person here tonight, if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2191.948s">And</a>  as I mentioned before, you know, over the past five months, we've been going through a process to help, you know, identify a vision for the project on the eastern shoreline of the Mystic Lakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2207.073s">And</a>  then present some initial ideas for what might be incorporated into the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2213.936s">And</a>  then this project is presenting a refined design concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2220.818s">And</a>  this is, again, this is the first step in a longer process. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2225.521s">After</a>  tonight's meeting, or Tuesday's meeting, and we receive feedback we're going to finalize a report that we are then going to hand to the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2237.328s">And</a>  hopefully they will put the project kind of into their mechanisms for being designed and eventually constructed. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2248.196s">So</a>  after June 30th, we're going to be kind of taking a step back from the project and becoming local champions and advocates like you to help see it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2259.806s">So</a>  that's the meeting this coming Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2264.329s">And</a>  we have also, there's a list of other upcoming events. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2268.213s">If</a>  infrastructure or Greenways projects isn't your thing, we have some volunteer opportunities, some educational events coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2275.399s">So</a>  we have a list on the table as well if you're interested.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2279.062s">Could</a>  you maybe talk a little bit about what some of those opportunities are? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2283.907s">What</a>  types of things folks who want to get involved can do?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2287.93s">Yeah,</a>  so we have we have no no short of an invasive species In our watershed, so we do do volunteer cleanup days. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2296.516s">It's</a>  a good good way to get outside, but we have literature on community boating programs and we are hosting a number of tablings that Farmers markets we were at the Medford farmers market just yesterday and so our staff and our summer and <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2316.249s">Fellows</a>  especially are kind of all throughout the watershed kind of doing these different initiatives and As I mentioned too, we have a robust educator program. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2325.235s">So</a>  if you're interested in nature based education we go into local schools and our educator Natalia does an amazing job with that and always looking for for educators as well and <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2338.303s">so</a>  so yeah, there's I think education, you know volunteering in a stewardship capacity and Patrick we have I don't know if there's anything to add but we also are wrapping up our herring annual herring run where the the it's a wife herring That's right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2353.752s">You</a>  can go online mystic herring org and you can help us count the fish there's a camera in the water at the dam and <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2360.376s">We</a>  record these videos and ask for help, and we get about 5,000 people coming online to help us count the fish. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2366.537s">And</a>  I'm sorry, this is a little trivia here, but this Mystic River is home to one of the largest migrations of herring in all of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2375.639s">It's</a>  usually number one or number two in the whole state. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2378.459s">So</a>  it's a source of great pride, I have to say.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2383.06s">Very</a>  good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2385.84s">So</a>  if you had your druthers, <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2390.426s">between</a>  the science piece, the people piece, and the out in the nature piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2404.214s">What's</a>  the biggest pull on you personally?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2408.14s">You</a>  know, it used to be the nature piece, but now, you know, we're not rural Montana. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2413.406s">We're</a>  among the most densely developed places, and this is something that Carl was mentioning, and we're 76 square miles, and we're 21 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2423.937s">76</a>  square miles is the same size as Brooklyn, which is one community. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2428.061s">So</a>  we've got this amazing challenge ahead of us to create a place that's so filled with people that people will really have a healthy life here. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2439.652s">Whether</a>  you're growing up in West Medford or you're Cambridge or you're down in Chelsea, that everybody's got clean air, access to great parks, access to recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2449.662s">And</a>  a lot of these improvements are overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2452.725s">They're</a>  just so overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2454.066s">And</a>  there's other places you can go and be like, gosh, we've still got a ways to go in a lot of these places. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2459.372s">So</a>  that's the work that really excites me and makes me feel like the more people involved pushing for it, we can create a place that we're all really proud of.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2471.665s">And</a>  in that, obviously, you have to establish priorities for the different things that you would like to do in a perfect world. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2480.473s">You</a>  want to do all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2482.375s">But</a>  how does that piece kind of get settled out in terms of, OK, we have these nine things that we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2491.283s">What's</a>  the highest priority?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2494.229s">That's</a>  always hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2495.289s">And</a>  sometimes you recognize emerging moments that you have a moment that you can grab. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2504.192s">And</a>  I think that's what's happening on the Mystic Lakes right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2507.273s">We</a>  have a moment that we saw with a Mass Trails grant and some relationships there. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2513.835s">And</a>  if we're really lucky, we'll all come together if we do our work right. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2519.657s">Other</a>  times things are emerging and are of moment <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2523.278s">For</a>  example, at Shannon Beach. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2528.06s">Shannon</a>  Beach, I don't know if you know this, it was closed all last year because of water quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2534.682s">You</a>  could go there and swim, but the lifeguards were all over at the picnic table because they'd been told they can't, you know, be out there because it never met the water quality, the way they calculated. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2545.985s">And</a>  so it's a moment to be like, how can that be? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2550.051s">We've</a>  got to work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2551.052s">We</a>  either have to fix the water quality, or we've got to fix the notification system. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2557.621s">How</a>  is it that this incredibly important resource <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2561.666s">is</a>  not being used to its full capacity by all these residents who are showing up and trying to get a parking spot and ending up on side streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2571.594s">And</a>  there's so much need there, and it's like a moment, so we have to work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2578.059s">It's</a>  the residents say it, but it's also team members inside Myra who are just outraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2584.945s">They</a>  can't sit still. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2586.406s">They're</a>  like, I have to be in the room to talk about this and work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2590.109s">Fantastic,</a>  fantastic.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2592.29s">And</a>  this moment that we're in where the potential exists for doing something really meaningful with that, that's about a two mile stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2606.937s">What</a>  else that you have on your plate right now kind of equals that in terms of one, the people's desire to get it done, and your desire to see it get done?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2617.21s">I</a>  think in terms of regional benefit, it's probably numero uno. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2623.934s">It's</a>  a state park. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2626.135s">It's</a>  Mystic Lake State Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2628.076s">But</a>  there's no sign that says, welcome to Mystic Lake State Park, much as you might see in the suburbs where you turn off the state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2638.242s">And</a>  then there's a nice park service sign that says, welcome to the state park. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2643.805s">And</a>  then there's the ranger who's <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2645.086s">says</a>  hello right this is very like very like I'm entering this space that's very you know kind of natural and oh there's there's trail maps and I can there there's a visitor center with the bathroom right we have that at Shannon Beach now which is great but like the the experience at a state park should be a lot better than <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2665.999s">highway</a>  or sorry a road where You know 99% of the cars speed and I can't cross the street because there's no place to cross the street there's no signage saying that this is a state park and All the shorelines overgrown and there's only one place to access it at Shannon Beach Officially and so it's like what are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2687.183s">and</a>  so I think it's like it's it's an incredible regional asset and Needs to be valued <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2692.904s">Two</a>  miles goes by very quickly, and so how can we make it as accessible, as safe as possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2698.669s">Can</a>  we make it a regional destination for people with physical or mental disability by adding in a sensory trail for people with visual impairments or neurodivergence? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2711.598s">You</a>  know at bare minimum making sure that it's ADA accessible for everyone to equally or equitably enjoy the space We're working on very valuable projects that are services serving City of Malden or residents in Charlestown or other DCR parks But I think like this is a this is a regional destination where people are going to swim barbecue enjoy life and and I think that's that's it's it's pretty pretty up there and</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2737.079s">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2738.84s">Well,</a>  you know, the first time I ever got to fish it was down at, we called it Sandy Beach at the time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2744.701s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2745.842s">An</a>  elected official at some point got his name on it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2748.522s">It</a>  is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2751.623s">So</a>  folks, if you have an opportunity, there's information about it over on the table about the third public meeting of the Mystic Lakes Pathway Planning Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2765.788s">It</a>  would be a good thing to do if you can get on Zoom and have a listen because there's a lot that's being talked about and the ultimate plan is a pretty robust use of the space and a pretty significant change to the space.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2789.862s">If</a>  I can say one more thing, so we have some flyers that you can grab and take with you but if you can't make the meeting and Putting kids down to sleep or dinner or just I don't have any for a zoom meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2802.527s">We</a>  have we'll have the same materials available online or contact information as well on a website that's on a flyer for for a few weeks, so <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2813.051s">So,</a>  you know, if you can't make that exact time, no worries, pop in a few days later and you'll have a chance to engage in the project.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2820.837s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2821.357s">Thank</a>  you, Carl. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2822.719s">I'm</a>  going to give you the last word. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2824.54s">What</a>  do you think you want the people to know about who you are, what you're doing, and why you're doing it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2831.826s">I</a>  think I've said a lot of that, Terry, and I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2836.122s">Let</a>  me just say that one piece of trivia is that you've got bald eagles that have just hatched and have three eaglets in the nest, but a half mile away from us here, just on the other side of the lake. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2851.674s">I</a>  think we forget that we're embedded in the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2856.216s">And</a>  Terry, I know your roots run really deep here. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2859.157s">And</a>  maybe my last message is just gratitude that you've taken this river under your wing and raised attention of this and contributed your art toward raising awareness of both the river and also the issues and social history around this river and West Medford being centered for a lot of the history here. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2878.684s">Kami</a>  is grateful for having us and for your work.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2881.868s">Well,</a>  the community center benefits when, in our general environment, things happen that can reflect the light back onto what this community is, what this community's been. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2898.169s">in</a>  the access that we've had, but also the access that we've been denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2902.936s">So</a>  if I have an opportunity to do something meaningful in that regard, I'm probably going to try and take advantage of the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2913.894s">Gentlemen,</a>  I think that's about all the time we have to chop it up, as they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2918.899s">Hopefully,</a>  we haven't had to water the discussion down too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2922.563s">See</a>  what I did there? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2923.644s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2924.465s">Thank</a>  you so much for bringing your organizational perspectives and working experience to the table this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2930.571s">We</a>  are clearly in a season of dramatic change in our natural environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2935.376s">Thoughtful</a>  stewardship and diverse collaboration is needed more than ever before. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2940.801s">It's</a>  good to know that the Mystic River Watershed is advancing progressive approaches to preserving and sharing the river's resources across a broad span of connected communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2952.512s">And</a>  to everyone watching, thanks so much for your attentiveness and your interest in our discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=2959.157s">Get</a>  ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin

href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3489.853s">Okay,</a>  so now it's time to turn our attention, as we always do, to what I refer to as the lyrical miracle that we've engaged for this evening's side of the musical ledger. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3502.125s">So</a>  in 1785, the Scottish poet Robert Burns wrote, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry or astray. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3512.094s">Tonight's</a>  musical program is a classic example of that sentiment. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3516.198s">Now,</a>  our original entertainment for the evening was supposed to be a return engagement for the wonderful pairing of Athene Wilson and Rollins Ross. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3525.907s">However,</a>  Athene called me early this morning in with considerable regret, informing me that she had no voice and was really, really feeling quite poorly. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3536.597s">Still,</a>  being the pro that she is, she secured another amazing colleague and vocalist to join brother Rollins, who's back here on the keys, for this evening's show. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3547.322s">He</a>  is none other than the remarkable David Fuller. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3550.864s">David</a>  is an accomplished musician and a retired educator. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3554.586s">He</a>  has <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3556.667s">decades</a>  of experience on the stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3559.228s">He's</a>  also a teacher, a Councilor, an administrator, former. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3564.05s">He</a>  is currently a working drummer and vocalist who performs all over New England at weddings, club dates, and a variety of special events. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3572.433s">He</a>  praises God for his extensive career and his opportunity to develop friendships, support students, and make music. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3580.996s">Noah</a>  Thien, no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3582.757s">David</a>  is here to help save the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3585.919s">David</a>  is accompanied by an old friend of the program, Rollins Ross. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3596.662s">See</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3597.182s">See</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3597.602s">See</a>  how that works? <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3598.583s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3599.383s">Rawlins</a>  is a frequent collaborator with the Theme Wilson and numerous other musical luminaries in the Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3606.204s">He</a>  is also a music educator and has a heart for getting young people involved in music and music production, conducting workshops and classes throughout Boston neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/arb7-6jVP08&t=3616.327s">He</a>  is a keyboard virtuoso, an arranger, and prolific music producer as well. <a
