[SPEAKER_20]: And myself, Vice Chair Emily Hedeman.

33
00:01:56,633 --> 00:02:01,255
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle Evans, I'm sorry, I'm vice chair, but I'm also acting as chair.

34
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:05,836
[SPEAKER_20]: Our trustee chair, Jackie McPherson has moved on from the board.

35
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:07,797
[SPEAKER_20]: She's actually in Jamaica right now.

36
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:09,438
[SPEAKER_20]: So I hope she's having a really great time.

37
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,739
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're so thankful to her for all of her service.

38
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:17,421
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'll be acting as chair prior to board elections.

39
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,742
[SPEAKER_20]: So Danielle, can you please introduce any staff on the call?

40
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,091
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

41
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:39,337
[SPEAKER_32]: Myself, Daniel Evans, Senior Planner, along with Alicia Hunt, who's the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, and I believe that's all we have from our office tonight, unless somebody's hiding.

42
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:44,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Sal DeStefano, our Director of Economic Development, just joined.

43
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm here, thank you.

45
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:48,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Great to have you here, Sal.

46
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:53,044
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so this is,

47
00:02:57,042 --> 00:03:07,912
[SPEAKER_20]: Our first item before us means that I might not be standing in his chair for much longer, but I think I'm going to serve as chair for this meeting regardless.

48
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:09,834
[SPEAKER_20]: We can talk about it later.

49
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:18,382
[SPEAKER_20]: But we are looking for nominations for board members for the roles of chair, vice chair, and clerk.

50
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:26,023
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll open that up to the board if anybody would like to nominate somebody else or nominate themselves.

51
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:33,971
[SPEAKER_20]: And Danielle is able to provide descriptions of the roles and their responsibilities if you have questions.

52
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:43,621
[SPEAKER_20]: There is also the opportunity to continue this discussion, but it would be great to have some new leadership in the new year.

53
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:57,140
[SPEAKER_21]: I will just say that I cannot put myself in the running as the CDB board's representative to the CPC.

54
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,461
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm unfortunately at capacity.

55
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:06,085
[SPEAKER_21]: And barring anyone jumping up, it may be worth continuing because I expect tonight to be a long meeting.

56
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:10,288
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for that, Ari.

57
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:11,929
[SPEAKER_20]: And I respect the work-life balance.

58
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,410
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you for being straightforward with that.

59
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,190
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate it.

60
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:17,872
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter, I see you're unmuted.

61
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:38,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I was going to, uh, nominate, um, I was going to nominate, uh, can I do two nominations or should I do one at a time?

62
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:40,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, cool.

63
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,001
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to nominate.

64
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:49,006
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, I was going to nominate Emily for chair, given her proximity to the chair already.

65
00:04:51,480 --> 00:05:00,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll deal with that one for now.

66
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,363
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it a conflict of interest if I?

67
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:04,483
[SPEAKER_20]: No?

68
00:05:05,023 --> 00:05:05,343
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

69
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Are there any other nominations for chair?

70
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:12,045
[SPEAKER_20]: I do accept your nomination, Peter, and I appreciate it.

71
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:12,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

72
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:14,486
[SPEAKER_20]: Are there any other nominations for chair?

73
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:20,227
[SPEAKER_20]: I would roundly endorse that nomination if you accept it.

74
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,618
[SPEAKER_20]: So do we do a roll call vote?

75
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, if you prefer, Danielle, or I could run the roll call vote if that feels more appropriate.

76
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:34,305
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, just so there's no perception of conflict.

77
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:36,366
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want people to feel like I'm pressuring them.

78
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:38,568
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you say no, I fully respect that.

79
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:40,630
[SPEAKER_20]: Any members of the board as well?

80
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:43,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

81
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:45,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any other nominations for chair?

82
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:50,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Seeing none.

83
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:54,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Shall we close the nominations?

84
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,811
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's only one nomination, I guess, actually, you can vote yes or no.

85
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,193
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's just do a roll call vote.

86
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:07,476
[SPEAKER_15]: And I didn't prep for this, so I'm just going to read them across the screen on my screen.

87
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:08,657
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure.

88
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:13,801
[SPEAKER_15]: For Emily Henneman as chair, Peter Calves?

89
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:15,022
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

90
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:16,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Annie Strang?

91
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:17,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

92
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:19,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Ari Fishman?

93
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:20,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Enthusiastic, yes.

94
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:22,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Emily Hedeman.

95
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:23,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

96
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:26,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Ben Lavallee.

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Enthusiastic, yes.

98
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:30,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Sabrina Alpino.

99
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:31,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

100
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:34,927
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is all the members here this evening.

101
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:36,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations, Emily.

102
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:38,390
[SPEAKER_15]: You have been elected chair.

103
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:40,553
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to make my mom watch this recording.

104
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:47,588
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so that gives us some open space.

105
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,090
[SPEAKER_20]: We have vice chair as open.

106
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:57,995
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would actually love to nominate Peter Calves as the vice chair.

107
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:06,781
[SPEAKER_20]: He has performed diligently and effectively and respectfully as clerk for this body for the past, I believe, year and a half.

108
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:11,525
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would love to see his leadership continue as vice chair.

109
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:13,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

110
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:14,462
[SPEAKER_10]: I will accept that nomination.

111
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:17,803
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will note that I was not clerked for the whole last year and a half.

112
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:23,266
[SPEAKER_20]: Your leadership had a longer impact than it was in reality.

113
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:25,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad to hear.

114
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:26,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I gladly accept the nomination.

115
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:30,890
[SPEAKER_20]: Are there any other nominations for vice chair?

116
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:39,874
[SPEAKER_20]: We do still have clerk available, which maybe we'll move to another meeting.

117
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:43,418
[SPEAKER_20]: just respecting the agenda this evening.

118
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:50,681
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so seeing no other nominations for vice chair, do we need to do a motion?

119
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,201
[SPEAKER_20]: I forget.

120
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,182
[SPEAKER_20]: I already forgot.

121
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:54,002
[SPEAKER_20]: No, OK.

122
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:55,703
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to do a yes or no vote.

123
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:58,744
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie Strang.

124
00:07:59,645 --> 00:07:59,925
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

125
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:01,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Ben LaValle.

126
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:03,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

127
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:04,807
[SPEAKER_20]: Sabrina Alpino.

128
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:05,727
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

129
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:07,408
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter Calves.

130
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:08,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

131
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:10,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari Fishman.

132
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,393
[SPEAKER_20]: Enthusiastic, yes.

133
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:16,416
[SPEAKER_20]: And myself, Emily Hedeman, extra enthusiastic.

134
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,017
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for being my backup.

135
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:20,218
[SPEAKER_18]: No problem.

136
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:21,559
[SPEAKER_20]: Congratulations, Peter.

137
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,141
[SPEAKER_20]: Excited to have you in leadership.

138
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:33,886
[SPEAKER_20]: Before we move on, any clerk or representative interest?

139
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,795
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, seeing none, let's keep moving.

140
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:48,580
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do encourage members of the board to start thinking about those roles.

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,342
[SPEAKER_20]: I encourage you to reach out to Danielle or Alicia just to learn more about what it is.

142
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:55,084
[SPEAKER_20]: I was clerk, it can be a fairly light lift.

143
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:57,305
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really what you make it.

144
00:08:57,686 --> 00:08:59,827
[SPEAKER_20]: So talk to Peter, he was a recently clerk.

145
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:05,651
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, a spot for everybody on the board to be a leader.

146
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:13,452
[SPEAKER_20]: So our next item on the agenda is A&R plan endorsement for 31 Wilson Road.

147
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:23,758
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we have representatives for the applicant that would like to present their proposal for 31 Wilson Road?

148
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:26,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Please raise your hand so we can find you.

149
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,180
[SPEAKER_20]: This is 31 Wilson Road.

150
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:41,946
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam Chair, I think it might be Wilson Street that might have been- I'm sorry, Wilson Street.

151
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:49,668
[SPEAKER_32]: I might've had a typo, I think.

152
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:55,670
[SPEAKER_32]: Regardless if the applicant isn't here, but I did tell him that he would be first on the agenda.

153
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,691
[SPEAKER_32]: We can still act on this in their absence.

154
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:06,533
[SPEAKER_32]: I can bring up and explain what they're doing.

155
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:08,182
[SPEAKER_32]: That would be great.

156
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:08,962
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Danielle.

157
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:12,985
[SPEAKER_32]: One moment.

158
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,930
[SPEAKER_32]: Or we could table this and take it at the end since they're not here.

159
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:26,994
[SPEAKER_20]: Why don't we table this and keep going?

160
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:32,177
[SPEAKER_20]: We can try to take it in between agenda items as we move forward.

161
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:33,017
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

162
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:33,978
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

163
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:46,262
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, so moving on to our next item is a continued public hearing for 401 Boston Ave.

164
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:49,403
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a site plan review for a Dover amendment use.

165
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:53,845
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a continued public hearing.

166
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:59,928
[SPEAKER_20]: The role of continued public hearings is that the applicant can present any new information.

167
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:05,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter, I see your hand and I want to make sure that, is this you recusing yourself?

168
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:06,709
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

169
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:07,029
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

170
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:11,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Just making sure that that gets captured before we get too far into things.

171
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:11,992
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

172
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:15,334
[SPEAKER_20]: This is, I guess this is us capturing that.

173
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:16,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

174
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:16,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

175
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:24,720
[SPEAKER_10]: As usual, when this project comes up, because I work for Niche Engineering who did civil and traffic engineering work on this project and

176
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:30,277
[SPEAKER_10]: The company policy for that is to recuse yourself from anything they're working on.

177
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:39,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I will be recusing myself from this project and will not be participating in any debate under votes and will rejoin for the next item.

178
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:40,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

179
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:41,464
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

180
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:42,425
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Peter.

181
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,253
[SPEAKER_20]: So starting over, this is a continued public hearing.

182
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:52,158
[SPEAKER_20]: The point of this continued hearing is for the applicant to present any new information.

183
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:57,743
[SPEAKER_20]: The public will have an opportunity to provide comments on this new information.

184
00:11:58,203 --> 00:11:59,585
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to make sure that that's clear.

185
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:00,946
[SPEAKER_20]: New to new.

186
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:04,289
[SPEAKER_20]: And let's see.

187
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:21,009
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so at this time, I would also like to introduce, um, the city's attorney, Robin Stein.

188
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:37,738
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, Robin, if you could, uh, provide some opening remarks to frame the questions and required findings before our community development board, um, and then also explain some limitations under the Dover amendment.

189
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,192
[SPEAKER_20]: I see Robin is muted.

190
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:50,918
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

191
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,140
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, I wouldn't have let me unmute myself.

192
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:55,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Your camera is also off.

193
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:59,785
[SPEAKER_20]: If you'd be comfortable turning on your camera, that would be helpful.

194
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:00,946
[SPEAKER_22]: My video says it's on.

195
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:02,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Hold on one second.

196
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,769
[SPEAKER_22]: On the screen, it says my video is on.

197
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,492
[SPEAKER_27]: Sometimes it's the little switch at the top.

198
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:09,333
[SPEAKER_27]: Exactly.

199
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:10,174
[SPEAKER_27]: Did that fix it?

200
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:11,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you.

201
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:12,325
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

202
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:14,386
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure where I am.

203
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:15,948
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't see me, but I can see you.

204
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,509
[SPEAKER_22]: So good enough, I guess.

205
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:28,196
[SPEAKER_22]: But before we go forward, I just want to confirm the applicants aware that they only have five members on this application this evening?

206
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:32,279
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct?

207
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:34,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Meaning five members of the board?

208
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:39,444
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, because you had six present and Peter's recused.

209
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:41,945
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we still have enough.

210
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:42,585
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

211
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:45,948
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to make sure they're clear on that.

212
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:46,389
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

213
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:47,270
[SPEAKER_20]: I see some nods.

214
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,030
[SPEAKER_20]: Pat?

215
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:53,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chair, if I may, Patrick Gallagher, Wilson and Storrs, and we are comfortable proceeding.

216
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:54,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

217
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:54,717
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

218
00:13:55,357 --> 00:13:55,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

219
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:55,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

220
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:05,877
[SPEAKER_22]: So, obviously, I'm happy to speak to this.

221
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:11,219
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you want me to just kind of summarize the Dover amendment requirements?

222
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:13,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Or would you like me to speak to the ordinance specifically?

223
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:16,582
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd say a high level of both.

224
00:14:17,843 --> 00:14:18,463
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so.

225
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:26,587
[SPEAKER_22]: Underlaw Chapter 48, Section 3 contains a number of provisions and protections for different uses.

226
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:29,688
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of those we refer to as the Dover Amendment.

227
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,709
[SPEAKER_22]: It results from a case involving the town of Dover and it got coined that way.

228
00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:37,250
[SPEAKER_22]: And those are religious, educational, child care uses.

229
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:42,252
[SPEAKER_22]: And essentially what the statute says is that zoning ordinances and zoning bylaws

230
00:14:43,970 --> 00:15:01,225
[SPEAKER_22]: can't prohibit, require special permits for, and reasonably regulate the use of land or structures for educational purposes, in this case, on land that's owned or leased by a variety of different entities, one being a nonprofit educational corporation.

231
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:06,135
[SPEAKER_22]: But that you can subject those uses to reasonable regulations.

232
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:18,486
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's essentially the issue is, is the use on land that is owned or leased by a nonprofit educational corporation and ultimately is the use that they're proposing to make a bona fide educational use.

233
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Those are generally what.

234
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:21,910
[SPEAKER_22]: We look at zoning purposes.

235
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:34,561
[SPEAKER_22]: If you go into the city's zoning ordinance, consistent with that approach, there's a separate section in 94-11-8, which contains a site plan review process just for the donor amendment use.

236
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:36,343
[SPEAKER_22]: So, for example, on educational use.

237
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:42,065
[SPEAKER_22]: And in that section in 94-11-83, it lays out the scope of the site plan review.

238
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:43,886
[SPEAKER_22]: It has the board's charge, essentially.

239
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:54,991
[SPEAKER_22]: And the board's charge in this case is to make the findings, make a determination if, in fact, the proposed use is a Dover Amendment use protected under 48-3.

240
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:59,093
[SPEAKER_22]: And if so, what reasonable regulations concerning bulk,

241
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:08,096
[SPEAKER_22]: Height of structures, yard areas, lot sizes, setbacks, open space, parking, and building coverage can be imposed on the use and that comes straight out of the statute.

242
00:16:08,596 --> 00:16:15,078
[SPEAKER_22]: And just a point of clarification on that, you know, it's not an open ended analysis of what regulations you want to apply.

243
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:16,058
[SPEAKER_22]: You start with.

244
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:25,749
[SPEAKER_22]: The base dimensional controls that would apply to the use and then the question of reasonable regulation comes into the extent that the applicant is saying we can't meet one of those requirements.

245
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:29,994
[SPEAKER_22]: You would look at determining what is reasonable to apply to them.

246
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:32,076
[SPEAKER_22]: And the way that we look at what is reasonable is.

247
00:16:33,478 --> 00:17:01,852
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, if you were to apply the minimum requirements that they're saying that an applicant saying they can't meet, is that going to have a significant impact on their ability to accomplish the use compared to whatever the municipal goal that is sought to be accomplished through that regulation is and you have to weigh those against each other and really it's the applicant's responsibility to or their burden to establish to you why something shouldn't apply to them and why it's not, you know, reasonable to apply it.

248
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:05,834
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's basically the standard under both the statute and then again, under your bylaw.

249
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:13,057
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that kind of gives you the high level, but if you have any specific questions, obviously I'm here, I can answer those as well through the chair.

250
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Do any members of the board have specific questions about Attorney Stein's overview?

251
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:25,604
[SPEAKER_20]: If I may?

252
00:17:26,664 --> 00:17:27,304
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, yep.

253
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:34,883
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you clarify with reasonable regulation, you said that it starts with the established code.

254
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:45,214
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that mean that we are not allowed to provide any restrictions that fall with that are more restrictive than the minimum guidelines?

255
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:46,435
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that your interpretation?

256
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:50,281
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I mean, that would hold true in zoning all the time, right?

257
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:55,706
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, applicants are required to know what's, or applicants are entitled to know what's required of them.

258
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:57,447
[SPEAKER_22]: You come in with the base zoning.

259
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:04,633
[SPEAKER_22]: The question in Dover is, is it reasonable to apply this base zoning even, or is there relaxing that's reasonable, that's needed?

260
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:08,557
[SPEAKER_22]: So that you're not prohibiting the use through your base zoning.

261
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:10,598
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

262
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:11,059
[SPEAKER_22]: Great question.

263
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,362
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, seeing no other questions from the board.

264
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:23,223
[SPEAKER_20]: Back to you, Attorney Stein.

265
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,366
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have anything else to add at this point.

266
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:30,167
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there anything else you wanted me to touch on?

267
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:34,310
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's pretty much the way that the Dover review works.

268
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,510
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

269
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:37,372
[SPEAKER_20]: I really appreciate that insight.

270
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:40,033
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that'll set a nice scene

271
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:48,066
[SPEAKER_20]: for the board's ongoing review of this issue.

272
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:59,851
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, if I may, Attorney Stein, could you give us just a minute on your kind of professional judgment on whether this

273
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:04,655
[SPEAKER_21]: case meets the criteria.

274
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:14,730
[SPEAKER_21]: You've already explained it to the board, but I think it would be helpful to share that with the public, as I know that we've heard discussion of it in previous meetings, kind of confirming that.

275
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:21,624
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, again, nature and the minimum requirements.

276
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:27,028
[SPEAKER_22]: Ultimately, it's the board's decision.

277
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:44,699
[SPEAKER_22]: The board has to make that decision, but so long as a bona fide educational use is being proposed by a nonprofit organization with an educational purpose on land that's owned or leased by that educational entity, then it would be my opinion that the Dover Amendment would apply.

278
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:49,789
[SPEAKER_22]: And so it's just for the board to find the facts that fall within those categories or not.

279
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:59,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Any other questions from the board?

280
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:12,415
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, seeing none, I would like to request that the applicant presents any new information.

281
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:20,526
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we have representatives from the applicant available with any new information?

282
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:29,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chair, if I may, I think we have a brief presentation prepared.

283
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:38,735
[SPEAKER_08]: If Ross Cameron can be permitted to share his screen and then Rocco will start us off.

284
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia and Danielle, are you all set?

285
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:46,123
[SPEAKER_20]: giving Rocco and Ross the permissions they need.

286
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:48,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Rocco has permission, just sorry.

287
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:49,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Who is it?

288
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:53,406
[SPEAKER_33]: It's Freddie.

289
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:56,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Freddie, thank you.

290
00:20:57,828 --> 00:21:02,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

291
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:11,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Just so you know, everybody's not able to unmute themselves except that I have made Rocco, Dorico and Patrick

292
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:16,510
[SPEAKER_15]: and now Elke's been a co-host for the duration of this public hearing.

293
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody else would have to be unmuted.

294
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:20,714
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Alicia.

295
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:21,995
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that clarification.

296
00:21:23,236 --> 00:21:25,679
[SPEAKER_20]: Over to the applicant to present new information.

297
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:30,464
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.

298
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,705
[SPEAKER_33]: Ross, if you can go to slide two.

299
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:34,145
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

300
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:40,549
[SPEAKER_33]: This we hope is the culmination of what has been a very thorough site plan review process.

301
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:52,415
[SPEAKER_33]: I personally have worked on dozens of projects for Tufts University across all four of our campuses in Boston, Medford, Somerville, and Grafton.

302
00:21:53,356 --> 00:22:00,309
[SPEAKER_33]: And I can attest that this is the most comprehensive review that we've had of any project in my time here.

303
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:15,744
[SPEAKER_33]: We began by meeting with city officials and staff more than six months ago and had numerous meetings and conversations since then with elected officials, community partners, the building department, engineering, transportation, fire, health, and with our neighbors.

304
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:20,708
[SPEAKER_33]: This is our fourth presentation before the board dating back to last year.

305
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:24,971
[SPEAKER_33]: We also hosted three community meetings on the project.

306
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:29,975
[SPEAKER_20]: Just real quick, can you please try to focus on new information?

307
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,402
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe we've reviewed most of these dates before.

308
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:35,842
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

309
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:37,123
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

310
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:37,983
[SPEAKER_33]: Sorry for that.

311
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:42,926
[SPEAKER_33]: We will definitely speed ahead to new information.

312
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:45,668
[SPEAKER_33]: If we could go to the next slide, Ross.

313
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,489
[SPEAKER_33]: And I do think that there are some new.

314
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:59,372
[SPEAKER_33]: information here and that has to do with the conditions that we have, the commitments that we have agreed to.

315
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:15,675
[SPEAKER_33]: So in that regard we've had a half a dozen meetings with the MBTA and their consultants regarding new trees along Boston Avenue and have submitted our applications for that work to the MBTA in coordination with National Grid.

316
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:30,043
[SPEAKER_33]: We've committed $500,000 to the neighborhood, which we envision will be in the form of direct payments to folks that are closest to the project or otherwise directed to give it to in consultation with the community.

317
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:45,778
[SPEAKER_33]: And we've committed to making a $500,000 contribution to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund and to establish a new shuttle service from Medford Square to the Medford-Somerville campus and provide the city with a new blue bike station.

318
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,100
[SPEAKER_33]: These commitments go far beyond what is required of us in the context of a site plan review under the Dover Amendment.

319
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,682
[SPEAKER_33]: And we are hoping that they demonstrate how much we value and care about the community and our neighbors.

320
00:23:59,082 --> 00:24:00,562
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll now pass it on to Pat Gallagher.

321
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:02,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Morocco.

322
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:14,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chair and members of the board, in terms of new information, we'd like to share with you a brief supplemental shadow study that we prepared for tonight's hearing.

323
00:24:14,923 --> 00:24:25,533
[SPEAKER_08]: The focus of this is to establish, to the point raised by Attorney Stein, it's our burden to show you

324
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:30,235
[SPEAKER_08]: why we think that we are entitled to the relief that we are seeking.

325
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:40,546
[SPEAKER_08]: And one piece of that relief is from the front yard and side yard setbacks along Boston Avenue and University Avenue.

326
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:47,834
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we determined that the required setback on both would be 13 and a half feet.

327
00:24:49,537 --> 00:25:01,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And at certain points, the building is coming to a setback of as little as five and a half feet from the front yard and two feet, a little more than two feet from the side yard.

328
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:09,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that is relief that we are seeking by virtue of being a Dover Amendment use.

329
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:14,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And what Massachusetts courts have said in determining whether

330
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:22,677
[SPEAKER_08]: it is reasonable to apply a regulation, is to ask the question of would denying or conditioning the relief

331
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:27,881
[SPEAKER_08]: appreciably advance a legitimate municipal concern?

332
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:36,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a legitimate municipal concern that can be established if the relief were to be not granted or were to be conditioned?

333
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:48,475
[SPEAKER_08]: So we think the shadow studies that we've prepared and that Alcus Manfredi will present in a moment, establish that there is a very minimal impact that the setback relief causes

334
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:52,973
[SPEAKER_08]: to the additional shadow that would be created by the project.

335
00:25:53,213 --> 00:26:10,799
[SPEAKER_08]: That effectively the difference between a setback compliant project and the project that we are proposing is so minimal that it makes there to be really no municipal interest in denying or in conditioning that relief.

336
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,281
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason we're seeking that relief is important as well.

337
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:23,203
[SPEAKER_08]: The building has been sited in the way that it is located because we need adequate distance behind the building for fire access.

338
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:34,485
[SPEAKER_08]: And so reducing that distance between the buildings would be problematic in terms of having the fire department able to get in and have access fully around the site.

339
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:41,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, I'm going to pass it over to John Martin at Alcatraz Manfredi to walk through this updated shadow study.

340
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:44,008
[SPEAKER_43]: Good evening, everyone.

341
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:50,572
[SPEAKER_43]: Most of you are familiar with the shadow studies that we have done.

342
00:26:50,632 --> 00:27:05,443
[SPEAKER_43]: We're going to show you a new iteration of them tonight, which, as Pat says, makes the subtle distinction between a building that would comply with the setback requirement and the building that we propose.

343
00:27:06,263 --> 00:27:11,467
[SPEAKER_43]: The summation of the orange and blue areas on the

344
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:14,909
[SPEAKER_43]: shadow studies is the proposed building.

345
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:23,474
[SPEAKER_43]: The orange is what the shadow would be if we were to pull the building back to be within the setback limits.

346
00:27:24,155 --> 00:27:38,162
[SPEAKER_43]: And that leaves the blue as the increment that the shadow increases by being a little forward on Boston Avenue and a little closer to University Avenue.

347
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:47,485
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll take you through each of the four cardinal points of the year, beginning in the spring.

348
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:51,526
[SPEAKER_43]: And you see the hours starting at 9 a.m.

349
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:53,587
[SPEAKER_43]: and then noon.

350
00:27:53,607 --> 00:28:05,970
[SPEAKER_43]: I will pause here just ever so briefly to show you an enlarged version.

351
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,210
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

352
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,811
[SPEAKER_43]: This is the condition at 9 a.m.

353
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:21,123
[SPEAKER_43]: that little sliver of blue, that's the incremental shadow that is created by going over the required setback.

354
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:36,577
[SPEAKER_43]: So as Pat has already alluded to, this will be a very small thing that you will see through the slides that we go through.

355
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:42,195
[SPEAKER_43]: So this is nine and noon on March 21st, the spring equinox.

356
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:49,538
[SPEAKER_43]: The two panels on the left show the existing conditions today, the no build condition.

357
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:53,640
[SPEAKER_43]: The two panels on the right will always show the build condition.

358
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,721
[SPEAKER_43]: If we move through till 3 p.m.

359
00:28:57,221 --> 00:29:05,445
[SPEAKER_43]: and 4 p.m., again, you see just a little sliver of blue where my cursor is.

360
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you zoom in as you did before?

361
00:29:09,913 --> 00:29:10,313
[SPEAKER_43]: I can.

362
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,513
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

363
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:22,235
[SPEAKER_43]: That's 3 p.m., and then I'll scroll down.

364
00:29:23,615 --> 00:29:25,475
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, it looks like we're in June.

365
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:26,615
[SPEAKER_43]: I scrolled too far.

366
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,336
[SPEAKER_43]: That's 5 p.m.

367
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:31,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

368
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:36,477
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll leave it on this setting so I can zoom in.

369
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:38,902
[SPEAKER_43]: as required.

370
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:46,705
[SPEAKER_43]: If we go to June, the sun is more vertical in the sky, so the blue is even smaller.

371
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:48,725
[SPEAKER_43]: This is 9 a.m.

372
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:49,646
[SPEAKER_43]: and noon.

373
00:29:50,526 --> 00:29:51,166
[SPEAKER_43]: This is 3 p.m.

374
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:54,367
[SPEAKER_43]: and 6 p.m., and then a 7 p.m.

375
00:29:55,648 --> 00:29:56,168
[SPEAKER_43]: and a 10, well, 8 p.m.

376
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:57,369
[SPEAKER_43]: projection.

377
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:12,788
[SPEAKER_43]: If I go to the fall equinox in September, it's very similar to the spring equinox.

378
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:15,309
[SPEAKER_43]: Again, 9 a.m.

379
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,331
[SPEAKER_43]: and noon, 3 p.m.

380
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:19,312
[SPEAKER_43]: and 4 p.m.

381
00:30:19,932 --> 00:30:21,653
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you please zoom in on those as well?

382
00:30:21,893 --> 00:30:22,813
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, I will.

383
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:23,334
[SPEAKER_43]: This is 3 p.m.

384
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:23,434
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay.

385
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:39,147
[SPEAKER_43]: and this is 4 p.m.

386
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,031
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

387
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:50,035
[SPEAKER_43]: And then when we go to 5 p.m.

388
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:50,936
[SPEAKER_43]: and 6 p.m.

389
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,758
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll zoom in on 6 p.m.

390
00:30:56,401 --> 00:31:01,865
[SPEAKER_43]: Again the orange is the incremental shadow proposed by the setback compliant building

391
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:08,040
[SPEAKER_43]: And the blue is the additional shadow cast by the proposed building.

392
00:31:12,283 --> 00:31:16,646
[SPEAKER_43]: And then one last one.

393
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:29,814
[SPEAKER_43]: In the winter at 9 AM and then at noon,

394
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:32,754
[SPEAKER_43]: I'll zoom in on noon.

395
00:31:37,716 --> 00:31:39,257
[SPEAKER_43]: You see the little blue edge.

396
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:50,222
[SPEAKER_43]: And then at 1 p.m.

397
00:31:51,883 --> 00:31:53,363
[SPEAKER_43]: And I'll zoom in on that as well.

398
00:31:59,726 --> 00:32:00,527
[SPEAKER_43]: There's 1 p.m.

399
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:03,542
[SPEAKER_43]: 2 p.m.

400
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,365
[SPEAKER_43]: and then 3 p.m.

401
00:32:13,705 --> 00:32:14,585
[SPEAKER_43]: and 4 p.m.

402
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:17,186
[SPEAKER_43]: the sun has essentially set.

403
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:20,927
[SPEAKER_43]: It sets at 415 on December 21st.

404
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:22,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't we know it.

405
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,108
[SPEAKER_43]: And don't we feel it.

406
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:29,330
[SPEAKER_43]: I will turn it back over to Rocco.

407
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

408
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:43,832
[SPEAKER_33]: In closing, we wanted to thank the board for its time and consideration and to thank and recognize the administration and city staff and the neighbors who've spent.

409
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:49,386
[SPEAKER_33]: many hours reviewing and considering and discussing this project with us.

410
00:32:50,206 --> 00:32:56,350
[SPEAKER_33]: We look forward to continuing the conversation and are eager to bring this project to fruition.

411
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,272
[SPEAKER_33]: I know that you've got a lot on your agenda tonight.

412
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:02,514
[SPEAKER_33]: And I know you're probably tired of hearing from me.

413
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:07,777
[SPEAKER_33]: So I just wanted to end with a quote from one of our neighbors that was submitted to the city.

414
00:33:09,858 --> 00:33:25,952
[SPEAKER_33]: A new dorm on campus is both a great opportunity for Tufts students to experience their university years in close connection to Tufts and for the off-campus housing to be reused for working families in the South Medford and Hillside neighborhoods.

415
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:35,500
[SPEAKER_33]: As a Medford resident raising a family in South Medford neighborhood, I fully support a new dorm that opens up more housing for working families of Medford.

416
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:36,421
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

417
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:42,628
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you to the applicant.

418
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:46,510
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do see we have a hand raised.

419
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,312
[SPEAKER_20]: We will open the public hearing.

420
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:56,756
[SPEAKER_20]: I do want to open it first to the board for questions and comments, and then we will get to the public.

421
00:33:57,376 --> 00:33:58,957
[SPEAKER_20]: I do appreciate the public's patience.

422
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:03,940
[SPEAKER_20]: But I would like to first open it up to the board for questions and comments.

423
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,782
[SPEAKER_20]: Please raise your hand or unmute.

424
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:14,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Ben.

425
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:18,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

426
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:37,397
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the public would benefit from a little bit of commentary from the applicant around how the community commitments will be administered or managed and maybe even a little bit more detail on the nature of those commitments or those

427
00:34:38,603 --> 00:34:53,712
[SPEAKER_13]: um, legally enforceable, contractual commitments, maybe just a little bit of commentary on how those things will work, the shuttle, buses, the, um, the, the, the funds, um, those kinds of things.

428
00:34:57,674 --> 00:35:00,096
[SPEAKER_33]: Pat, do you want to discuss the, uh, neighborhood fund?

429
00:35:00,116 --> 00:35:03,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, um, if I may, Madam Chair, um.

430
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:04,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, thank you.

431
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:06,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to take

432
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:11,810
[SPEAKER_08]: The question's in reverse, Member Lavalle.

433
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:34,078
[SPEAKER_08]: So our intention is that all of the commitments that we've made and have expressed them through a letter to the board and to the mayor, that those are commitments that would be incorporated into a decision approving our site plan application, and that in that way, they would be binding on the applicant.

434
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:51,127
[SPEAKER_08]: With respect to the $500,000 community fund that we are proposing, our intention, and again, I'd like to frame this as an intention because we intend and hope that the conversation on this will be ongoing.

435
00:35:52,427 --> 00:36:04,012
[SPEAKER_08]: The intent is to establish an escrow account for those funds and to be able to make direct payments to folks who are particularly impacted by the project as a result.

436
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:08,182
[SPEAKER_08]: and to make payments directly from the escrow fund.

437
00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:22,995
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, I think the team would also like to stay open-minded, and if there are particular ideas from the community, we're open to listening to those as well if they envision a better way to approach that.

438
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:25,517
[SPEAKER_08]: But at this point, I think

439
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:32,236
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the kind of fairest and best way that we've determined.

440
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:36,059
[SPEAKER_08]: So does that answer your question?

441
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:37,780
[SPEAKER_13]: It does.

442
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:38,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

443
00:36:40,643 --> 00:36:47,368
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe there are some legal restrictions around the city's involvement in the neighborhood fund.

444
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:48,889
[SPEAKER_20]: So there is a

445
00:36:51,702 --> 00:36:55,804
[SPEAKER_20]: a line between that fund and kind of the city's mandate.

446
00:36:55,824 --> 00:37:00,605
[SPEAKER_20]: So that would be a direct connection between the applicant and the community.

447
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:02,546
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

448
00:37:02,626 --> 00:37:15,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair, for clarifying that, that the city would not have any involvement, um, you know, aside from insofar as it's a condition to a site for that, that would be the extent of it.

449
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,511
[SPEAKER_20]: Great question, Ben.

450
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:17,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for that.

451
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:30,509
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie, Ari, Sabrina, any questions or comments before we open it up to the public?

452
00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:36,316
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, seeing none.

453
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:40,881
[SPEAKER_20]: And we will reopen it to the board later, yeah.

454
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,923
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I see some hands going up.

455
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:48,564
[SPEAKER_20]: Feel free to raise your hand if you want to get in line.

456
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:51,367
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm now going to open the public comment period.

457
00:37:51,947 --> 00:37:59,754
[SPEAKER_20]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand function or please message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.

458
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:05,038
[SPEAKER_20]: You're also welcome to send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

459
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:11,497
[SPEAKER_20]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

460
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:14,960
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a legal requirement for this public hearing.

461
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:24,789
[SPEAKER_20]: And a reminder to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members.

462
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:31,094
[SPEAKER_20]: Comments are not part of the public record, and we want to make sure to do this the right way per open meeting law.

463
00:38:33,016 --> 00:38:38,683
[SPEAKER_20]: However, if a participant is having audio or technical issues, you're welcome to message staff for assistance.

464
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,826
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's going to be Alicia and Danielle.

465
00:38:42,107 --> 00:38:45,070
[SPEAKER_20]: As we've done in the past, each participant will have two minutes to speak.

466
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:50,196
[SPEAKER_20]: We will allow each participant to speak once.

467
00:38:52,233 --> 00:39:02,506
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you do have additional comments, we welcome you to email them to the email address provided or engage with the city at a later date.

468
00:39:04,128 --> 00:39:08,855
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia, are you able to manage the public comment queue?

469
00:39:11,757 --> 00:39:20,220
[SPEAKER_20]: I do realize that we've received a significant number of emails and letters, which are made available to all members of the board for us to review.

470
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,902
[SPEAKER_20]: And I thank all members of the public who have provided emails and letters.

471
00:39:28,563 --> 00:39:34,525
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia and Danielle, do you have any summary of the issues and themes for those letters?

472
00:39:40,620 --> 00:40:05,147
[SPEAKER_15]: overall i i feel that we've summarized for the board the letters before um i would say in a very broad there there was not significant new information other than uh objections to whether this was a dover use um and then uh shading and height and sight lines those were the biggest concerns in all of the letters um many of the uh

473
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,523
[SPEAKER_15]: People who wrote letters are here this evening.

474
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them already have their hands up.

475
00:40:11,224 --> 00:40:12,925
[SPEAKER_15]: So why don't we let them speak?

476
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:17,867
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we feel that there was stuff that was missing, then we can bring it up.

477
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:21,208
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was a lot of reiterating what we have already heard.

478
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:22,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

479
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:25,290
[SPEAKER_20]: And I appreciate all members of the public who have sent in letters.

480
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:29,351
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this time, we're opening the public hearing.

481
00:40:29,372 --> 00:40:31,392
[SPEAKER_20]: I see three hands.

482
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:35,174
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe Attorney Racer was first.

483
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:40,435
[SPEAKER_20]: And Alicia, are you going to manage the two minute timer?

484
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, thank you for saying that.

485
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:43,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

486
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:45,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

487
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:46,960
[SPEAKER_15]: It's built in.

488
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,145
[SPEAKER_15]: I am launching it.

489
00:40:50,465 --> 00:41:00,833
[SPEAKER_20]: We typically let people finish their thought, but we do appreciate everybody's respect for the two-minute timer to allow all members of the public equal involvement.

490
00:41:02,934 --> 00:41:03,074
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

491
00:41:03,355 --> 00:41:07,277
[SPEAKER_15]: And the order in which people raise their hands is the order that they appear on the screen.

492
00:41:07,337 --> 00:41:08,638
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want, I can call them out.

493
00:41:08,658 --> 00:41:09,959
[SPEAKER_20]: I can do it.

494
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:10,760
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

495
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:10,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

496
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,302
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Racer, are you able to unmute yourself?

497
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:15,420
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, thank you.

498
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:15,961
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

499
00:41:15,981 --> 00:41:16,381
[SPEAKER_35]: Madam chair.

500
00:41:17,422 --> 00:41:17,843
[SPEAKER_35]: Good evening.

501
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:18,464
[SPEAKER_35]: Madam chair.

502
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:20,787
[SPEAKER_35]: Congratulations and members of the board.

503
00:41:21,347 --> 00:41:23,030
[SPEAKER_35]: And thank you for the opportunity to speak.

504
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,851
[SPEAKER_35]: My name is Harley racer.

505
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:27,695
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm an attorney at the Boston law firm, rich may at 176 federal street.

506
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:32,321
[SPEAKER_35]: I represent a group of Medford residents, including butters to this project.

507
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:40,347
[SPEAKER_35]: As you heard from town council, it's up to you to look at the facts here and apply them.

508
00:41:40,907 --> 00:41:51,093
[SPEAKER_35]: One of the problems that we have is that we can't identify what the base zoning is because they ask, Tufts asks you to accept that we should treat this as one parcel.

509
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:52,893
[SPEAKER_35]: So these are three parcels.

510
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:58,937
[SPEAKER_35]: They're asking you to treat them as one parcel and they've not identified what relief they would need if it was treated

511
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:05,280
[SPEAKER_35]: As three different parcels and so that's one thing that I think is just a threshold problem to overcome.

512
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:15,205
[SPEAKER_35]: But when it gets to the base zoning that you're looking at, this is a point where the board has the authority to interpret and apply the definitions of the zoning ordinance.

513
00:42:15,945 --> 00:42:29,930
[SPEAKER_35]: and under the definition of the zoning ordinances the plain read is that these buildings would not be a dormitory because they have gainful business in them and non-residential uses and so it moves them into the multi-use dwelling definition.

514
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:38,893
[SPEAKER_35]: The plain read suggests that this is a multi-use dwelling and under the definitions they would have height restrictions of three stories or six stories.

515
00:42:39,773 --> 00:42:40,754
[SPEAKER_35]: Tufts should identify

516
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:56,040
[SPEAKER_35]: which number, this is of a multi use dwelling, and so whether it falls into the three stories or the six stories, but the board has the authority to interpret their bylaw, their ordinances in a reasonable way, and the authority to impose the reasonable regulation something that Tufts has refused to do.

517
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,663
[SPEAKER_35]: They've thumbed their nose at the mayor, the city council, this board, and members of the community by refusing to budge an inch.

518
00:43:02,743 --> 00:43:07,766
[SPEAKER_35]: There's been a lot of back and forth, but there's been no movement on the height of the building or the setback.

519
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:10,688
[SPEAKER_35]: And they say, de minimis, de minimis, de minimis, that adds up.

520
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,189
[SPEAKER_35]: They've offered some money, but you can't buy sunlight.

521
00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:19,012
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'd encourage the board to exercise your authority in interpreting your zoning ordinances and the reasonable regulations.

522
00:43:20,713 --> 00:43:20,954
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

523
00:43:20,994 --> 00:43:22,054
[SPEAKER_35]: I feel like I won an award.

524
00:43:24,536 --> 00:43:25,196
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for your time.

525
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:26,903
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

526
00:43:26,923 --> 00:43:28,124
[SPEAKER_20]: I really appreciate that.

527
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:33,787
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's noted that it's representing a group of residents.

528
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:35,068
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for that.

529
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:42,632
[SPEAKER_20]: And maybe we pick different time for music.

530
00:43:42,772 --> 00:43:44,013
[SPEAKER_15]: My apologies.

531
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:44,493
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's OK.

532
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:46,394
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot about that.

533
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:48,436
[SPEAKER_15]: And I am now trying to find that setting.

534
00:43:48,456 --> 00:43:51,197
[SPEAKER_15]: If it goes off on the next person, I apologize.

535
00:43:51,257 --> 00:43:52,638
[SPEAKER_15]: I just haven't found the setting yet.

536
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:53,338
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm working on it.

537
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:54,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

538
00:43:56,393 --> 00:43:59,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Next, in terms of public comment, I see Jeremy Martin.

539
00:44:00,618 --> 00:44:02,040
[SPEAKER_20]: Jeremy, are you able to unmute yourself?

540
00:44:04,883 --> 00:44:05,043
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

541
00:44:05,344 --> 00:44:05,564
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

542
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:07,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I am, thank you.

543
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:10,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Chair, my name is Jeremy Martin.

544
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:14,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 65 Burgett Avenue, very close to the building site.

545
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:23,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Chair and Director Hunt, out of respect for the board's time, several community members who have commented in the past have agreed to allow me to speak on their behalf.

546
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:28,751
[SPEAKER_00]: So respectfully, I'd ask if I could be allowed to make a slightly longer comment tonight.

547
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need about three minutes.

548
00:44:31,353 --> 00:44:32,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's appropriate.

549
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:33,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's start now.

550
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:34,475
[SPEAKER_20]: Please have your time, Alicia.

551
00:44:35,865 --> 00:44:51,374
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've had, board members, I hope you've had an opportunity to read the comment letter that we submitted yesterday, reiterating the issues with the project and urging you to apply the reasonable regulations that Harley referenced to the building height and to the building setbacks.

552
00:44:51,974 --> 00:45:02,416
[SPEAKER_00]: The letter is endorsed by over 120 Medford residents, the vast majority of which live in the Hillside neighborhood who will live in literally the shadow of this building.

553
00:45:03,397 --> 00:45:09,998
[SPEAKER_00]: As you've heard over the last two months, the community is frustrated by this matter, by this experience, and we're sure you are too.

554
00:45:10,618 --> 00:45:14,399
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can all imagine ways that we'd wish this process had been different and better.

555
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:19,921
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's a squandered opportunity to do something really good in a community that would welcome it.

556
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:21,321
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential is there,

557
00:45:22,161 --> 00:45:25,243
[SPEAKER_00]: But this project and this design does not live up to the moment.

558
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:35,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite reasonable and repeated calls, Tufts has refused to be a true partner to the community and has refused to consider alternatives or to explore a compromise that works for all.

559
00:45:36,011 --> 00:45:39,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we get misrepresentation of the process and gaslighting.

560
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:45,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, we wouldn't need a neighborhood improvement fund if not for the impacts of this building.

561
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:55,643
[SPEAKER_00]: You're now being asked to consider some complex legal questions, maybe hearing different interpretations of the ordinance, or you have questions about the power you have as a board to regulate this project.

562
00:45:56,264 --> 00:46:01,567
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect many of you want to address the issues with this project and support the community, but you feel stuck.

563
00:46:02,832 --> 00:46:06,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you feel that challenging Tufts is a losing proposition and not worth the risk.

564
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:13,317
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to know that our community is energized, our resources are growing, and we will not back down from a bully at our doorstep.

565
00:46:13,978 --> 00:46:17,860
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's any doubt, any uncertainty about how to vote,

566
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,501
[SPEAKER_00]: please vote in a way that requires Tufts to reconsider and change their proposal.

567
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:30,622
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be doing so with the support of the mayor, the city council, and our state legislators who have all written in support of the neighborhood.

568
00:46:31,182 --> 00:46:38,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, you would do it with the support of your community as evidenced by the sheer number of people who have signed on to our letter.

569
00:46:39,904 --> 00:46:44,365
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question about whether this issue is of critical municipal concern.

570
00:46:45,405 --> 00:46:55,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Dover puts the onus on Tufts to demonstrate why this project should be built without regard for their neighbors and let the courts decide this complex issue if that's what's needed.

571
00:46:56,551 --> 00:47:00,153
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very good chance they will uphold your interpretation of the zoning regulations.

572
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:11,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Harley has given you a sound legal path to regulate this as a multiple use, and you have the power under Dover to apply reasonable regulations of height, bulk, and setbacks to this project.

573
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:15,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing we're asking for stops Tufts from fulfilling their mission.

574
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,122
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that they and their development partners won't make as much money as they want to on this project.

575
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:26,024
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something I think we can all agree is not protected by Dover.

576
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:33,206
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, when you're asked to vote, please do so in a way that supports the resounding community sentiment about this project.

577
00:47:33,746 --> 00:47:37,707
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank you for your time, your service, and your continued consideration.

578
00:47:39,328 --> 00:47:40,048
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Jeremy.

579
00:47:40,328 --> 00:47:42,369
[SPEAKER_20]: Really appreciate the comments.

580
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:53,012
[SPEAKER_20]: Next, we have Doug Carr, who is also involved with the Medford Historical Commission.

581
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:55,213
[SPEAKER_20]: Doug, are you able to unmute yourself?

582
00:47:59,759 --> 00:48:00,121
[SPEAKER_38]: There we go.

583
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:00,463
[SPEAKER_38]: How's that?

584
00:48:00,523 --> 00:48:01,167
[SPEAKER_38]: Can you hear me?

585
00:48:01,187 --> 00:48:01,831
[SPEAKER_20]: Sounds great.

586
00:48:01,851 --> 00:48:02,595
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

587
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:08,437
[SPEAKER_38]: As you may know, I submitted, I've been looking for a middle ground here.

588
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:10,639
[SPEAKER_38]: I've been looking for something that's a good faith compromise.

589
00:48:10,699 --> 00:48:15,382
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm a huge fan of putting as much student housing as we can reasonably on this site.

590
00:48:15,422 --> 00:48:18,684
[SPEAKER_38]: I think it's an excellent site, but this building is just too large.

591
00:48:18,744 --> 00:48:28,190
[SPEAKER_38]: And I submitted to the chair an alternate design that tries to get Tufts the actual, the number of beds we're looking for, but takes two floors off the building.

592
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,331
[SPEAKER_38]: It's an incomplete design.

593
00:48:29,391 --> 00:48:30,712
[SPEAKER_38]: It's more of a concept design.

594
00:48:31,632 --> 00:48:45,565
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm happy to walk people through it in two minutes if you think that would be helpful, but I think what I'm looking for here is basically a pause in the process and asking the architects, Alcus Manfredi, who's a well respected architect, not only in Boston, but around the country and the world.

595
00:48:46,265 --> 00:48:48,227
[SPEAKER_38]: And Tufts has done some great buildings over the years.

596
00:48:49,128 --> 00:49:04,235
[SPEAKER_38]: to take a pause and see if there's a way to think outside the box, to see if there's a way to get the number of beds they're looking for, the 677, but by doing it with fewer floors and building further into the campus in wings that go back into the campus.

597
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,856
[SPEAKER_38]: And I've documented that, obviously, sent you that.

598
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:11,439
[SPEAKER_38]: Again, I defer to you, the chair, if you want me to walk people through it.

599
00:49:11,479 --> 00:49:17,722
[SPEAKER_38]: But I think that's what I'm looking for, is to try to build a reasonable consensus, because I want Tufts to get the number of beds they need.

600
00:49:18,642 --> 00:49:33,130
[SPEAKER_38]: But I also want to protect the community and 10 stories is excessive, it does the shadow studies do, I think, show quite a bit how the impact that is and I think there's a there's a little ground for willing to just pause and look back and say, is there a.

601
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:39,917
[SPEAKER_38]: a better way to think outside the box and to make this happen, not just on this one site, but a little further beyond it.

602
00:49:40,257 --> 00:49:47,245
[SPEAKER_38]: Maybe with the partial taking of the Hallowell dorm that is 42 years old this year, just one idea.

603
00:49:47,265 --> 00:49:50,809
[SPEAKER_38]: So I'm just looking for a pause to get ideas about

604
00:49:52,554 --> 00:50:05,113
[SPEAKER_38]: It's a compromise that won't satisfy everyone or maybe anyone, but it will, I think, give a little bit and be something in the middle versus a all or nothing situation we have now that I think has been a challenge.

605
00:50:09,852 --> 00:50:13,154
[SPEAKER_38]: So chair, would you like me to show the diagrams or you think that's not worth?

606
00:50:13,814 --> 00:50:25,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Not at this time, but I will remind the board that those comments shared by Mr. Carr are available in our public comment folder because they're public comment.

607
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,161
[SPEAKER_20]: They are also available to the public.

608
00:50:31,183 --> 00:50:38,247
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, yeah, not at this time though, but I do appreciate the insight and expertise that you've offered towards this topic.

609
00:50:39,222 --> 00:50:40,322
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, appreciate it, thank you.

610
00:50:45,845 --> 00:50:47,506
[SPEAKER_19]: I see Elizabeth Bale.

611
00:50:48,286 --> 00:50:49,987
[SPEAKER_19]: Elizabeth, are you able to unmute yourself?

612
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:52,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hear me?

613
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:53,928
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I did.

614
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,631
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to say I appreciate your address.

615
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:00,511
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you hear me?

616
00:51:01,212 --> 00:51:03,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, can you state your address for the record?

617
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:03,813
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't hear you.

618
00:51:03,873 --> 00:51:06,254
[SPEAKER_16]: You've got to unmute your speaker too.

619
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:10,390
[SPEAKER_20]: And Alicia, let's restart the time.

620
00:51:12,911 --> 00:51:14,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, is this working?

621
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:15,654
[SPEAKER_20]: Elizabeth, can you hear us?

622
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I can hear you.

623
00:51:17,915 --> 00:51:20,217
[SPEAKER_20]: You just need to state your name and address for the record.

624
00:51:20,237 --> 00:51:21,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, sorry.

625
00:51:21,398 --> 00:51:24,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Elizabeth Bale, 34 Emery Street.

626
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:27,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Should be able to use this technology by now.

627
00:51:30,144 --> 00:51:49,217
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say I appreciate that you just want to address new material but I'd just like to point out that it's been very difficult to get for for the public residents to get answers to questions and so if we can't get the answers then

628
00:51:50,494 --> 00:51:55,396
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't, it's hard to let go of questions that have been asked before.

629
00:51:55,496 --> 00:52:02,499
[SPEAKER_16]: So I will just try to be as quick as I can and just repeat a question that I have repeatedly asked.

630
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:09,683
[SPEAKER_16]: The president of Tufts and Rocco has responded, but not with not

631
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:12,564
[SPEAKER_16]: answering the question repeatedly.

632
00:52:13,124 --> 00:52:15,465
[SPEAKER_16]: And the question is, I'm just going to read it.

633
00:52:15,705 --> 00:52:38,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Why can't or won't Tufts either place this behemoth set of buildings somewhere internal to the Tufts Medford campus, such as on Professor's Row, where the temporary housing is now located, or distribute a comparable amount of new dorm space over more reasonably scaled buildings and additions

634
00:52:39,235 --> 00:53:02,817
[SPEAKER_16]: in locations such as that Professor's Row area, Talbot Ave, Packard Ave, areas adjacent to Powder House Boulevard, the former hillside hardware space, and other locations that will not have the severe permanent negative impact on the neighborhood and the city that this proposed high-rise project will inflict.

635
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:12,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Several smaller scaled projects can accomplish the laudable objective to provide more on-campus housing without harming the community.

636
00:53:12,457 --> 00:53:18,882
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've been unable to get a chance and answer since I learned about this project in the end of October.

637
00:53:19,662 --> 00:53:23,065
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want the board to be aware of that.

638
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:25,566
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for your comment.

639
00:53:25,646 --> 00:53:26,767
[SPEAKER_20]: And I hear your frustration.

640
00:53:29,013 --> 00:53:35,875
[SPEAKER_20]: We will allow the applicant to address any concerns raised by the public at the closing of this public hearing.

641
00:53:36,335 --> 00:53:39,716
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's really up to them whether they address that question.

642
00:53:39,756 --> 00:53:41,217
[SPEAKER_20]: But I hear your frustration.

643
00:53:41,357 --> 00:53:43,137
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you for joining the public hearing.

644
00:53:43,197 --> 00:53:46,898
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you and saying that.

645
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:47,559
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate it.

646
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:52,140
[SPEAKER_20]: I see another hand raised.

647
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,060
[SPEAKER_20]: The name is JFD8.

648
00:53:59,855 --> 00:54:01,015
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, can you hear me?

649
00:54:01,535 --> 00:54:03,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, please state your name and address.

650
00:54:03,216 --> 00:54:04,556
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is John Dillon.

651
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,276
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 11 Norwood Road.

652
00:54:06,696 --> 00:54:12,898
[SPEAKER_23]: And I would like for Tufts to address a baseline.

653
00:54:12,938 --> 00:54:14,798
[SPEAKER_23]: What I see is a baseline problem.

654
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:22,080
[SPEAKER_23]: I suspected that their shadow studies on what is existing here are inaccurate.

655
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:27,101
[SPEAKER_23]: And I have sent, I tried to send a video, but also several photos

656
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:32,903
[SPEAKER_23]: of what Stearns Field looked like at 3 p.m.

657
00:54:34,244 --> 00:54:49,033
[SPEAKER_23]: exactly on December 21st, and what I have seen, what I documented looks nothing like what Tufts is depicting in their shadow studies.

658
00:54:49,113 --> 00:54:52,015
[SPEAKER_23]: Can they address that?

659
00:54:53,076 --> 00:54:54,877
[SPEAKER_23]: If I can't believe the baseline

660
00:54:56,472 --> 00:54:59,674
[SPEAKER_23]: figures, what else can we not believe here?

661
00:55:00,614 --> 00:55:01,434
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

662
00:55:03,155 --> 00:55:03,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Jeff.

663
00:55:03,756 --> 00:55:04,776
[SPEAKER_20]: Appreciate the questions.

664
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,181
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't see any other hands from members of the public.

665
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:21,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia, Danielle, have we received any emails while we've been in the public hearing?

666
00:55:24,507 --> 00:55:26,708
[SPEAKER_15]: have you written additional for this case?

667
00:55:27,149 --> 00:55:27,429
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

668
00:55:27,649 --> 00:55:33,053
[SPEAKER_20]: Has anybody reached out with any technical issues trying to participate?

669
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:35,114
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam chair?

670
00:55:36,095 --> 00:55:41,118
[SPEAKER_32]: I've been, there have been a few emails.

671
00:55:41,158 --> 00:55:48,383
[SPEAKER_32]: There was one from Penny Taylor, which I added, which was actually in support of both of the

672
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,360
[SPEAKER_32]: matters.

673
00:55:51,623 --> 00:55:57,112
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, just to clarify, is Penny in the meeting this evening and would like to speak?

674
00:55:57,172 --> 00:55:59,376
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, no, I just checked for letters.

675
00:55:59,817 --> 00:56:00,037
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

676
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,179
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, there was an email.

677
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:01,620
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

678
00:56:01,961 --> 00:56:02,201
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

679
00:56:02,842 --> 00:56:03,163
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

680
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:23,357
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing no additional public comments, we are going to close the public comment period for this meeting related to 401 Boston Ave.

681
00:56:23,597 --> 00:56:35,084
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to thank all members of the public for their comments, their thoughts, whether it was tonight, the past couple of nights that you all have been with us, emails, letters.

682
00:56:36,445 --> 00:56:38,206
[SPEAKER_20]: We've read them and we hear you.

683
00:56:38,226 --> 00:56:39,067
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you so much.

684
00:56:40,287 --> 00:56:46,371
[SPEAKER_20]: At this point, I would like to open it up to the board for us to ask any additional questions.

685
00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:46,872
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

686
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,474
[SPEAKER_22]: Robin Stein from KP law.

687
00:56:49,494 --> 00:56:53,476
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I just clarify when you say you're closing the public hearing for this?

688
00:56:53,656 --> 00:56:57,939
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you closing the public hearing or you're just going back to board deliberation?

689
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,222
[SPEAKER_22]: Because if you close the whole public hearing, then.

690
00:57:02,998 --> 00:57:06,360
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't have any further discussion with the applicant about conditions or anything.

691
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,241
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to clarify what you meant by that.

692
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:15,225
[SPEAKER_20]: So our intention was to close the public participation aspect of the public hearing.

693
00:57:15,985 --> 00:57:19,567
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this is a learning opportunity for how we conduct our meetings.

694
00:57:19,968 --> 00:57:20,868
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Attorney Stein.

695
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:22,489
[SPEAKER_20]: So the public hearing is still open.

696
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:24,730
[SPEAKER_20]: You're just going back to the board conversation for now.

697
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:25,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

698
00:57:25,531 --> 00:57:26,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for the clarification.

699
00:57:26,891 --> 00:57:27,632
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.

700
00:57:31,008 --> 00:57:45,072
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would also like to go back to the applicant because there were some concerns raised by the public and give the applicant an opportunity to address those concerns from the public and then we will go to the board.

701
00:57:45,352 --> 00:57:50,754
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just, I wanna thank everybody for their patience with me as I guide us through this meeting.

702
00:57:50,894 --> 00:57:51,274
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

703
00:57:54,395 --> 00:57:55,335
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

704
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:58,436
[SPEAKER_33]: And I'll turn it over to Pat Gallagher to answer those questions.

705
00:58:00,057 --> 00:58:00,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

706
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

707
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:03,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Rocco.

708
00:58:04,045 --> 00:58:10,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, so I just want to make sure that I was taking down all the questions.

709
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:20,599
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a question regarding, should this be considered a dormitory and what are the effects of that decision?

710
00:58:20,619 --> 00:58:30,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that Mr. Carr has submitted a plan to the board and I can comment on that.

711
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:37,685
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was a question with respect to why this location and not another location.

712
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:41,307
[SPEAKER_20]: I also heard the validity of the shadow study.

713
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:50,655
[SPEAKER_20]: And then Attorney Racer had some questions around the zoning for the parcels that make up this proposed site.

714
00:58:51,636 --> 00:58:51,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

715
00:58:52,136 --> 00:58:52,316
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

716
00:58:53,057 --> 00:58:57,321
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me start responding to Attorney Racer's comments briefly.

717
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:07,758
[SPEAKER_08]: The first question that was raised relates to the existing parcels that make up the Tufts campus.

718
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:14,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the purposes of our application, we are treating the Tufts campus as a single zoning lot.

719
00:59:15,905 --> 00:59:27,830
[SPEAKER_08]: That approach is both consistent with Massachusetts law, which treats commonly owned adjacent parcels as being merged for zoning purposes.

720
00:59:29,271 --> 00:59:33,893
[SPEAKER_08]: And our approach is also consistent with an approach that the city endorsed

721
00:59:34,853 --> 00:59:41,455
[SPEAKER_08]: in 1990, in the early 90s, in connection with the permitting of the Dowling Hall garage.

722
00:59:41,595 --> 00:59:46,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's an approach of treating the campus, the core campus, as a single zoning lot.

723
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:50,258
[SPEAKER_08]: And when the question was put to the courts,

724
00:59:51,442 --> 01:00:00,327
[SPEAKER_08]: the court confirmed that that was an appropriate way for the city and for TOPS to treat its campus.

725
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:02,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Because again, it's all commonly owned.

726
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:05,511
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a single campus.

727
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:11,334
[SPEAKER_08]: The court agreed that it was appropriate to treat it as a single zoning lot.

728
01:00:11,514 --> 01:00:20,780
[SPEAKER_08]: We have presented the project in terms of things such as required open space, looking at the campus as a whole.

729
01:00:22,026 --> 01:00:30,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, we think that is the correct approach, which is consistent with the city's established practice and consistent with Massachusetts law.

730
01:00:32,718 --> 01:00:39,405
[SPEAKER_08]: There was also a question raised by Attorney Racer as to whether this project constitutes a dormitory.

731
01:00:41,047 --> 01:00:59,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Under the zoning ordinance, a dormitory is defined as a building designed for or occupied as a residence for students or staff, owned by or under the supervision of an institution, or an educational use which is not operated as a gainful business.

732
01:00:59,362 --> 01:01:02,705
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's two clauses there.

733
01:01:03,718 --> 01:01:13,908
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a business, rather a building designed for or occupied as a residence for students or staff owned by or under the supervision of an institution.

734
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:20,094
[SPEAKER_08]: So we take the position that this is unequivocally a dormitory.

735
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:27,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would also add that it seems that the issue that's being raised here is with the ground floor retail space.

736
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:34,066
[SPEAKER_08]: We feel that the ground floor retail space enhances the project for students, for neighbors.

737
01:01:34,846 --> 01:01:42,891
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that in early conversations with the city on this project, the city requested that we incorporate retail space into the project.

738
01:01:43,011 --> 01:01:45,252
[SPEAKER_08]: So we think it's really a benefit.

739
01:01:46,332 --> 01:01:51,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do not think that that changes the determination of whether or not this is a door.

740
01:01:54,056 --> 01:01:55,117
[SPEAKER_08]: So to that point,

741
01:01:57,144 --> 01:02:04,051
[SPEAKER_08]: This would fall into the classification of buildings that is subject to 825 foot maximum building height, which we are below.

742
01:02:04,571 --> 01:02:13,780
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we are not seeking relief for building.

743
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:19,245
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think those were the issues raised by Attorney Racer that I heard.

744
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:35,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And moving on to Mr. Carr's comment, I just want to be really clear that Mr. Carr is not associated with the project team.

745
01:02:35,896 --> 01:02:40,858
[SPEAKER_08]: We did not ask him to prepare a sketch plan.

746
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:46,940
[SPEAKER_08]: We did review the plan that he prepared, and Rocco met with him the other day.

747
01:02:48,693 --> 01:02:58,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to point out to the board that the types of things that he suggested in the plan would result in 75 fewer beds in the project.

748
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:05,623
[SPEAKER_08]: It would necessitate an entire dormitory being taken offline during construction to demolish part of the dorm.

749
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:09,125
[SPEAKER_08]: It would impede buyer access to Dowling Hall.

750
01:03:10,645 --> 01:03:14,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And there would be higher costs as a result and a longer construction period.

751
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:25,392
[SPEAKER_08]: When we go through the design process with our team before plans are ever submitted, there are a lot of different iterations that are looked at for any project, including this one.

752
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:35,357
[SPEAKER_08]: And early on in the design phase, some of the things that Mr. Carr suggested were looked at, and they weren't incorporated because of the reasons that I outlined.

753
01:03:35,577 --> 01:03:37,237
[SPEAKER_08]: It just wouldn't be feasible for this project.

754
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:54,177
[SPEAKER_08]: So responding to the question of the validity of the shadow study, I'm not an engineer, but I will say that Alpes Manfredi is

755
01:03:55,619 --> 01:04:00,142
[SPEAKER_08]: one of, if not the most preeminent architecture firm in the city.

756
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:01,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we stand behind their work.

757
01:04:03,144 --> 01:04:05,126
[SPEAKER_08]: They have done excellent work for us.

758
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:15,533
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've spent a great deal of time analyzing this from every angle and trying to make sure that we're presenting the most accurate information that we can.

759
01:04:15,673 --> 01:04:21,998
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that is the most that I can say as to that question that was raised.

760
01:04:24,388 --> 01:04:34,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think the final question was regarding the location and why this project is located here and why not in another location on campus.

761
01:04:35,482 --> 01:04:42,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the reason for that is that this site was identified years ago by Tufts University as being

762
01:04:43,912 --> 01:04:49,774
[SPEAKER_08]: just based on the size and shape of this site as being an ideal location for housing.

763
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:56,096
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also looked at it as an opportunity to take a stretch of Boston Avenue that

764
01:04:58,705 --> 01:05:19,633
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, walking down the sidewalk today and you see a hill with a parking lot on top of it and that that's an opportunity to really remake the streetscape along Boston Avenue and to do so with a housing project that satisfies a critical need to bring more students to campus and

765
01:05:21,483 --> 01:05:31,933
[SPEAKER_08]: That's central to Tufts' goal as an educational institution, to have students on your campus and to have them be part of that community more so than living in the neighborhoods.

766
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:39,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So we felt that having this in this particular location gave us the best opportunity to accomplish those goals.

767
01:05:42,404 --> 01:05:43,345
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Attorney Gallagher.

768
01:05:49,057 --> 01:05:52,962
[SPEAKER_20]: So if there's nothing else from the applicant, I'm going to go ahead and open it up to the board.

769
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:56,146
[SPEAKER_20]: We have any additional questions.

770
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,592
[SPEAKER_20]: And this also kicks off deliberations.

771
01:06:01,413 --> 01:06:03,055
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari, I see your hand.

772
01:06:05,034 --> 01:06:11,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to members of the public and the applicant for all the information and comment.

773
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:23,049
[SPEAKER_21]: I would love to hear the perspective of Attorney Stein on the question of the dormitory first floor business.

774
01:06:23,209 --> 01:06:29,994
[SPEAKER_21]: My understanding is that it does not change the designation, but I would like to hear that confirmed from the city's lawyers.

775
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:33,437
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Stein, are you able to comment on that?

776
01:06:36,237 --> 01:06:40,239
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, so I mean, you have seen the definition that's in the city's ordinance.

777
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:47,783
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't indicate that it has to be, you know, 100% for residential use.

778
01:06:47,843 --> 01:06:51,925
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see, in my opinion, I think this qualifies as a dorm.

779
01:06:51,945 --> 01:06:55,847
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, obviously, if it's challenged, I can't promise what a judge will say.

780
01:06:56,467 --> 01:07:01,050
[SPEAKER_22]: But in my opinion, this qualifies under a definition of a dorm.

781
01:07:04,411 --> 01:07:05,312
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Attorney Stein.

782
01:07:07,158 --> 01:07:08,819
[SPEAKER_20]: Any other questions or comments, Ari?

783
01:07:16,264 --> 01:07:17,685
[SPEAKER_21]: Thoughts, but not questions.

784
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:21,988
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'll let other members of the board speak if they have thoughts.

785
01:07:22,868 --> 01:07:23,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

786
01:07:24,009 --> 01:07:30,814
[SPEAKER_20]: Ben, Annie, Sabrina, any questions before we start yapping?

787
01:07:32,355 --> 01:07:32,955
[SPEAKER_20]: I do not.

788
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:33,896
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

789
01:07:35,558 --> 01:07:37,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Nor do I. Thank you for checking.

790
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

791
01:07:40,804 --> 01:07:51,195
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, given all the information that we have today, our authority as the board, I am comfortable saying that this is a Dover use.

792
01:07:55,299 --> 01:07:57,742
[SPEAKER_20]: And looking specifically at

793
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:06,001
[SPEAKER_20]: the relief that the applicant is asking us to provide, which is the setback.

794
01:08:10,525 --> 01:08:14,369
[SPEAKER_20]: It truly feels like such a minor difference.

795
01:08:16,271 --> 01:08:20,195
[SPEAKER_20]: And in some cases, there is no difference in the impact of that setback.

796
01:08:26,822 --> 01:08:32,505
[SPEAKER_20]: So the two questions before the board are, does this use qualify as a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment?

797
01:08:33,565 --> 01:08:35,646
[SPEAKER_20]: We have our League Council saying yes.

798
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:44,291
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Tufts on land.

799
01:08:45,011 --> 01:08:46,332
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be for Tufts students.

800
01:08:47,773 --> 01:08:52,535
[SPEAKER_20]: The fact that there's a for-profit developer does not impact its protected status.

801
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:02,747
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the second question in front of us is what are reasonable regulations that should be imposed on the use.

802
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:09,394
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, the focus here is on the relief from strict adherence to the zoning ordinance.

803
01:09:11,115 --> 01:09:13,938
[SPEAKER_20]: Before I said for setbacks, but it's also for parking.

804
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:22,776
[SPEAKER_20]: Given the location of parking on campus, they're not seeking relief for a number of spaces.

805
01:09:22,816 --> 01:09:25,097
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just, it's going to be elsewhere.

806
01:09:25,137 --> 01:09:27,739
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the front yard setbacks.

807
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:34,043
[SPEAKER_20]: So the question then becomes, is there a municipal interest in imposing these requirements?

808
01:09:36,184 --> 01:09:44,369
[SPEAKER_20]: Legal counsel, staff, the information that we've received today, believe that the setback relief is warranted as that would

809
01:09:46,218 --> 01:09:48,219
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, cause a substantial burden on the project.

810
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:59,347
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not just talking economic like the the fire access was something that stood out to me as something that would be an issue with the existing setback proposed.

811
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:07,075
[SPEAKER_20]: And then relief from parking location is warranted.

812
01:10:07,356 --> 01:10:12,381
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a large college campus, as the neighbors know.

813
01:10:13,202 --> 01:10:16,926
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not practical or necessary to site parking spaces adjacent to each building.

814
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,108
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that's reasonable.

815
01:10:19,128 --> 01:10:24,874
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'd be interested in hearing any opinions from the board.

816
01:10:24,894 --> 01:10:27,097
[SPEAKER_20]: And I welcome differing opinions.

817
01:10:35,725 --> 01:10:38,846
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie, I see you came off mute.

818
01:10:41,387 --> 01:10:42,587
[SPEAKER_20]: Got any insight for us?

819
01:10:54,871 --> 01:10:56,452
[SPEAKER_20]: Arianna, you said you had some thoughts.

820
01:10:56,892 --> 01:10:58,833
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you feel comfortable sharing them at this time?

821
01:11:00,033 --> 01:11:00,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

822
01:11:03,854 --> 01:11:13,596
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that many of the questions and concerns and frustrations about this project and the process that I've heard from residents continue to be true.

823
01:11:15,016 --> 01:11:27,478
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't see a legal argument where, given the responsibilities I have to uphold the current zoning, where I can vote against it.

824
01:11:28,419 --> 01:11:30,039
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think all the concerns that were

825
01:11:30,712 --> 01:11:42,719
[SPEAKER_21]: brought up are frankly valid, and I continue to be frustrated that Tufts has not been willing to adjust the height and shadow effects on the neighborhood.

826
01:11:42,739 --> 01:11:46,402
[SPEAKER_21]: I hear folks' frustration.

827
01:11:46,982 --> 01:11:50,985
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that there has been many discussions and not much change.

828
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:59,690
[SPEAKER_21]: And it is simultaneously true that I think given the legal guidance we have,

829
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:04,253
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think I have grounds to vote against it.

830
01:12:05,473 --> 01:12:06,614
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not very happy about it.

831
01:12:10,277 --> 01:12:10,497
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

832
01:12:11,602 --> 01:12:12,942
[SPEAKER_20]: I would share a similar sentiment.

833
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:14,663
[SPEAKER_20]: And there are things that I'm excited about.

834
01:12:14,683 --> 01:12:19,904
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think even some of the opponents of this plan have voiced it.

835
01:12:20,604 --> 01:12:30,345
[SPEAKER_20]: Increased student housing, getting people out of the triple-deckers and making that available for families or workforce housing, that's exciting.

836
01:12:31,706 --> 01:12:32,486
[SPEAKER_20]: But I agree with you.

837
01:12:32,566 --> 01:12:37,807
[SPEAKER_20]: And if I were Tufts, I'd just be really mindful that,

838
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:42,222
[SPEAKER_20]: just like you're not going anywhere.

839
01:12:42,522 --> 01:12:44,564
[SPEAKER_20]: Like these neighbors have been here a long time.

840
01:12:44,784 --> 01:12:48,527
[SPEAKER_20]: They've established their families, their work, their friendships.

841
01:12:50,249 --> 01:12:54,753
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really, really important for you all to be good neighbors as well.

842
01:12:54,773 --> 01:13:08,964
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I don't see a place where we as the Community Development Board acting within our mandate can be actionable.

843
01:13:10,622 --> 01:13:12,383
[SPEAKER_20]: in a way to satisfy every concern.

844
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:27,251
[SPEAKER_20]: Sabrina, Ben, any thoughts?

845
01:13:32,253 --> 01:13:33,814
[SPEAKER_13]: I echo what's been said already.

846
01:13:35,455 --> 01:13:35,775
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

847
01:13:41,342 --> 01:13:53,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I think everything's been said, um, just noting again, like, there's some disappointment, there are some pros, but I'm just here to listen to the broader community.

848
01:13:55,352 --> 01:13:55,772
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

849
01:13:59,074 --> 01:14:04,017
[SPEAKER_20]: So we do have a condition document, um, that helps to

850
01:14:05,303 --> 01:14:10,245
[SPEAKER_20]: codify some of the conditions that Tufts has already discussed this evening.

851
01:14:10,265 --> 01:14:13,407
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to open that up for discussion with the board.

852
01:14:13,427 --> 01:14:18,689
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle, are you able to pull that up for us?

853
01:14:32,995 --> 01:14:33,816
[SPEAKER_32]: Is this too small?

854
01:14:33,876 --> 01:14:34,596
[SPEAKER_32]: Can you guys see this?

855
01:14:35,962 --> 01:14:38,223
[SPEAKER_32]: I couldn't make it a little tiny.

856
01:14:38,963 --> 01:14:40,104
[SPEAKER_32]: How do we make the there we go?

857
01:14:40,624 --> 01:14:42,645
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we can do one page zoom in.

858
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:44,566
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, it looks good.

859
01:14:45,226 --> 01:14:45,527
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

860
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:45,887
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

861
01:14:46,007 --> 01:14:48,988
[SPEAKER_32]: And this is also in the meeting folder.

862
01:14:49,608 --> 01:14:52,690
[SPEAKER_32]: So members of the board can follow along.

863
01:14:53,210 --> 01:15:01,214
[SPEAKER_32]: So in the absence of a clerk, I will fulfill that role tonight.

864
01:15:01,754 --> 01:15:04,515
[SPEAKER_32]: So these conditions were developed.

865
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:20,115
[SPEAKER_32]: in conjunction with various city staff, the city engineer, fire chief, the health department director, the director of traffic and transportation.

866
01:15:23,972 --> 01:15:27,696
[SPEAKER_32]: The Department of equity and diversity equity inclusion.

867
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:33,582
[SPEAKER_32]: So, the first several are mostly boilerplate the first just list the control plans.

868
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:39,548
[SPEAKER_32]: So these are the plan sets that are being voted on tonight.

869
01:15:42,999 --> 01:15:47,606
[SPEAKER_32]: And so they, if there's any changes to these number two is the plan modifications.

870
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:57,840
[SPEAKER_32]: So, this basically says that it should be built in accordance to the plans that gives you a process for modifying.

871
01:15:59,932 --> 01:16:05,173
[SPEAKER_32]: Third, that this should be recorded, the registry deeds prior since the building permit.

872
01:16:06,973 --> 01:16:21,556
[SPEAKER_32]: The fourth condition, the site plan approval, including the termination of the reasonable application of dimensional parking requirements to the project is conditioned on the use of the property being for an educational use, protected and exempted from Dover Amendment.

873
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:27,197
[SPEAKER_32]: Should the property cease to be used for an educational use under the Dover Amendment,

874
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:32,039
[SPEAKER_32]: the property in the use thereof shall conform to the then application requirements of the zoning ordinance.

875
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:47,648
[SPEAKER_32]: So if this discontinued, ceased to be a Dover use, whether like Tufts sold it or something happened and it's not a Dover use anymore, then it would now not have this.

876
01:16:47,668 --> 01:16:48,389
[SPEAKER_32]: They'd have to come back.

877
01:16:48,429 --> 01:16:49,269
[SPEAKER_32]: They'd probably have to.

878
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:53,932
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not sure what the process would be, but it wouldn't be legal at that point.

879
01:16:58,585 --> 01:17:03,486
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, the fifth one is requiring a construction management plan.

880
01:17:03,506 --> 01:17:08,567
[SPEAKER_32]: And I guess I can just read it.

881
01:17:08,847 --> 01:17:15,668
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, prior to the issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall provide a written construction management plan for review and approval by the building commissioner and the engineering division.

882
01:17:16,249 --> 01:17:23,510
[SPEAKER_32]: Safe and ADA compliant pedestrian and cyclist access will be preserved along Boston Avenue and University Avenue during the duration of construction.

883
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:27,751
[SPEAKER_32]: A 24-7 contact line for construction related questions or concerns.

884
01:17:28,371 --> 01:17:30,612
[SPEAKER_32]: will be established for the duration of construction.

885
01:17:31,012 --> 01:17:35,394
[SPEAKER_32]: The contact line number will be posted in a highly visible location at the project site.

886
01:17:35,695 --> 01:17:45,439
[SPEAKER_32]: So if there's anything happening and someone needs to get a hold of someone, there will be someone who will answer the phone 24-7.

887
01:17:45,759 --> 01:17:46,900
[SPEAKER_32]: Tufts has said that they will do this.

888
01:17:49,018 --> 01:17:51,380
[SPEAKER_32]: And then these are the following are the engineering conditions.

889
01:17:52,141 --> 01:18:02,109
[SPEAKER_32]: The applicant will work with the engineering division to identify and undertake an acceptable infiltration and flow mitigation project in Medford subject to and in accordance with applicable law.

890
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:09,175
[SPEAKER_32]: So city engineer will work with them to identify what project will be done.

891
01:18:09,195 --> 01:18:12,758
[SPEAKER_32]: And there's a formula associated with that.

892
01:18:12,778 --> 01:18:13,359
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

893
01:18:15,402 --> 01:18:19,744
[SPEAKER_32]: Seven is about no saddle connections, unless they upgrade the sewer main.

894
01:18:24,186 --> 01:18:40,653
[SPEAKER_32]: Prior to issuance of a CO to maintain open pedestrian access at the southeast corner of Boston Avenue, University Avenue, and adjacent to the project site along the frontage of Boston Ave, the applicant will work with the engineering division on a mutually acceptable easement and or donation of the triangular portion of the lot to the right of way.

895
01:18:43,364 --> 01:18:47,746
[SPEAKER_32]: All utility crossing shall have a minimum of 18 inches separation.

896
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:55,931
[SPEAKER_32]: Basically, the city engineer is asking for a cross section that shows that this is being met.

897
01:18:57,472 --> 01:19:10,120
[SPEAKER_32]: Number 10, in accordance with engineering directive number three, the applicant shall mill and repay from curb to curb the segment of Boston Ave along the entire frontage of the project prior to issuance of the full and final CO.

898
01:19:12,473 --> 01:19:24,719
[SPEAKER_32]: 11.

899
01:19:12,553 --> 01:19:24,719
[SPEAKER_32]: In addition to the new sidewalk along the subject property, the applicant has agreed to replace the sidewalk on the northerly side of Boston Avenue with a new concrete sidewalk built to the City of Medford standards for public roads prior to issuance of a full and final CO.

900
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:24,719
12.

901
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:33,303
[SPEAKER_32]: Prior to issuance of a CO, the applicant will sponsor a new blue bike station on Boston Ave or another location agreed upon

902
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:44,105
[SPEAKER_32]: with the director of traffic and transportation including purchase and installation of an 11 dock station and payment of the recurring annual fees.

903
01:19:44,125 --> 01:19:48,649
[SPEAKER_32]: 13 is the applicant will establish free shuttle service between Campus Center and Bedford Square.

904
01:19:49,569 --> 01:19:57,155
[SPEAKER_32]: The shuttle service must commence no later than upon the issuance of all permits and approvals for the operation of the project, including lodging house licenses.

905
01:19:58,931 --> 01:20:05,597
[SPEAKER_32]: 14, a dedicated ride share drop off zone that can accommodate at least four standard size cars will be provided in front of a building on Boston Avenue.

906
01:20:05,617 --> 01:20:12,462
[SPEAKER_32]: 15, students living in the residence hall will not be eligible for city of Medford on street parking permits.

907
01:20:12,962 --> 01:20:21,909
[SPEAKER_32]: So if a student living in this residence hall brings a car, they will not be able to get a parking permit from the city.

908
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:27,374
[SPEAKER_32]: They either need to park it on campus or find some place to garage it privately.

909
01:20:30,183 --> 01:20:37,725
[SPEAKER_32]: 16, the applicant will add two new crosswalks at the intersection of Boston Avenue and University Ave, as shown on the approved plans.

910
01:20:39,165 --> 01:20:40,726
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the health department conditions.

911
01:20:42,286 --> 01:20:47,207
[SPEAKER_32]: During any demo construction, the applicant must remediate dust with the use of water trucks with calcium chloride.

912
01:20:47,227 --> 01:20:51,208
[SPEAKER_32]: Street adjacent to the project site will be kept clean at the close of every workday.

913
01:20:51,228 --> 01:20:53,048
[SPEAKER_32]: And this is where that number comes up.

914
01:20:53,089 --> 01:20:56,149
[SPEAKER_32]: If neighbors see that it's not being kept clean, call the number.

915
01:20:57,109 --> 01:20:57,570
[SPEAKER_32]: Let them know.

916
01:21:01,658 --> 01:21:09,961
[SPEAKER_32]: 18, pre-demolition and pre-construction integrated pest management plans are a mandated requirement by the city's road and control ordinance prior to issuance of building permit.

917
01:21:10,721 --> 01:21:14,122
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's about the monthly reports and all of that.

918
01:21:14,162 --> 01:21:17,683
[SPEAKER_32]: So we don't want rats.

919
01:21:17,703 --> 01:21:20,023
[SPEAKER_32]: 19, there shall be no permanent exterior dumpsters.

920
01:21:20,483 --> 01:21:25,705
[SPEAKER_32]: All solid waste generated from the new residence halls shall be kept in fully enclosed trash and recycling rooms.

921
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:32,635
[SPEAKER_32]: And then here's a series of conditions to try to mitigate light spillage.

922
01:21:34,336 --> 01:21:41,661
[SPEAKER_32]: So 20, to lessen the potential negative impacts of light spillage from the building, no common amenity spaces will be provided above the second floor.

923
01:21:42,161 --> 01:21:49,646
[SPEAKER_32]: And for the avoidance of doubt, the term common amenity spaces does not include common living or kitchen space serving individual apartments.

924
01:21:50,006 --> 01:21:58,172
[SPEAKER_32]: The common amenity spaces above the ground floor will be equipped with occupancy sensors that further reduce light spillage when such places spaces are not occupied.

925
01:21:59,792 --> 01:22:05,854
[SPEAKER_32]: And 21, all windows in each dormitory unit will have operable blinds or shades to reduce light emittance.

926
01:22:06,854 --> 01:22:16,738
[SPEAKER_32]: So every single room, bedrooms, living room, they all have operable shades so they can close them and try to keep the light inside.

927
01:22:19,358 --> 01:22:34,527
[SPEAKER_32]: 22, new trees will be added to the south side of Boston Ave along the frontage, along the project site frontage subject to approval from National Grid to move the existing power lines in subject and upon receipt of all other required permits and approvals.

928
01:22:36,408 --> 01:22:45,774
[SPEAKER_32]: The applicant will use commercially reasonable efforts to work with the MBTA and National Grid to add new trees to the north side of Boston Ave consistent with the approved plans.

929
01:22:46,334 --> 01:22:47,715
[SPEAKER_32]: The applicant will coordinate with

930
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:53,811
[SPEAKER_32]: PDS and the selection of appropriate tree species, which subject to receipt of necessary permits and approval.

931
01:22:53,851 --> 01:23:00,076
[SPEAKER_32]: So prioritize providing screening of the building from the residential neighborhood on the northern side of the train tracks.

932
01:23:01,737 --> 01:23:11,104
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the additional commitments that have been agreed to 24 is the $500,000 contribution to the affordable housing trust.

933
01:23:11,984 --> 01:23:16,528
[SPEAKER_32]: And that would be due upon all receipt of all permits and licenses.

934
01:23:17,747 --> 01:23:34,758
[SPEAKER_32]: and 25 is with regards to the $500,000 neighborhood improvement fund that'll be held in a escrow account and will be for the benefit of the residents, but the city will not be involved with this fund at all.

935
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:46,066
[SPEAKER_32]: So those are the 25 draft conditions that are for your consideration that have been reviewed by

936
01:23:47,587 --> 01:23:54,091
[SPEAKER_32]: Robin Stein, who is serving as our legal counsel for this case, along with the applicant.

937
01:23:54,111 --> 01:23:58,094
[SPEAKER_32]: And I will stop sharing.

938
01:23:58,114 --> 01:24:01,576
[SPEAKER_32]: I can figure out how to do that.

939
01:24:01,716 --> 01:24:05,398
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari does have a question, so you may want to keep that up, Ari.

940
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:13,684
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm following up on some comments we received in an earlier meeting in terms of the ride share.

941
01:24:14,497 --> 01:24:15,518
[SPEAKER_21]: stoppage area.

942
01:24:15,638 --> 01:24:18,160
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate that it's been increased to four cars.

943
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:28,987
[SPEAKER_21]: I would not be surprised if there were still traffic buildup and many rideshare people just like ignoring parking regulations as they do around the entire city.

944
01:24:29,488 --> 01:24:43,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it possible to include anything about Tufts being required to use Tufts resources to ensure that parking regulations are enforced there and don't cause some traffic and

945
01:24:45,072 --> 01:24:46,853
[SPEAKER_21]: pedestrian and bike hazards.

946
01:24:49,193 --> 01:24:56,416
[SPEAKER_21]: And the second thought I had reading it was in terms of light and noise.

947
01:24:57,116 --> 01:25:03,958
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it seems that that's the best we're going to get in terms of existing

948
01:25:04,815 --> 01:25:30,328
[SPEAKER_21]: regulations, but I remember we had discussions when there was a roof deck a few years ago, but kind of any discussion about regulations that they will place on their students that they are to be respectful of their neighbors and with an understanding that there are limits to how much we can put in here, but I think that would be appreciated by the neighborhood and seems perfectly reasonable and legal to my understanding.

949
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:39,441
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia, Danielle, do you have any insight on how we could potentially incorporate those into the conditions?

950
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:43,022
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we have light spillage mitigation and screening conditions.

951
01:25:43,102 --> 01:25:45,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Could we have noise mitigation?

952
01:25:48,203 --> 01:25:56,065
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a certain window thickness or R value or X variable that

953
01:25:58,565 --> 01:26:07,172
[SPEAKER_15]: My recommendation would be to start with the applicant and see how they feel about those and if they have any ways that they could do that.

954
01:26:07,352 --> 01:26:11,596
[SPEAKER_15]: For example, the parking traffic issue, they have their own police force.

955
01:26:11,636 --> 01:26:16,580
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what they can and cannot do, but hopefully Rocco might be able to speak to that.

956
01:26:18,161 --> 01:26:20,403
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I'd be curious hearing from the applicant.

957
01:26:20,683 --> 01:26:26,568
[SPEAKER_20]: I do want to allow Ben an opportunity to speak just in case we can combine

958
01:26:29,072 --> 01:26:35,236
[SPEAKER_13]: It's unrelated, but it might be good to get my question out before Rocco takes his turn.

959
01:26:36,616 --> 01:26:37,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the time.

960
01:26:37,437 --> 01:26:43,200
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to request that a little bit of clarification be added to condition 13.

961
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:57,048
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be good to specify whether the free shuttle service is only available to Tufts students or whether it's available to the general public or only Medford residents or just a little bit more

962
01:26:57,847 --> 01:27:01,608
[SPEAKER_13]: detail on who benefits from that condition.

963
01:27:01,628 --> 01:27:05,109
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a great point.

964
01:27:05,269 --> 01:27:08,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Can the applicant address the three concerns raised?

965
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:23,294
[SPEAKER_20]: Noise, shuttle clientele, and on-demand delivery driver drop-off.

966
01:27:24,794 --> 01:27:26,015
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

967
01:27:27,902 --> 01:27:34,227
[SPEAKER_33]: I can address the Tough Shuttle and the ride share and parking enforcement.

968
01:27:34,307 --> 01:27:38,510
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll defer to Pat on noise and anything that I may have missed.

969
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:43,553
[SPEAKER_33]: In regards to the Tough Shuttle, yes, it would be open to anybody.

970
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:45,775
[SPEAKER_33]: We don't check IDs on our shuttles.

971
01:27:46,315 --> 01:27:54,021
[SPEAKER_33]: So for example, we currently run a route from campus to Davis Square, and that is free and open to the public, and that would be our same.

972
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,381
[SPEAKER_33]: policy with this.

973
01:27:55,461 --> 01:28:14,909
[SPEAKER_33]: And the idea is, we have heard a lot, I myself, being from the Chamber of Commerce, about the desire to have more students go to Medford Square, and vice versa, for neighbors to have the opportunity to come to campus to, for example, access the Green Line.

974
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:17,991
[SPEAKER_33]: So that would be a free service that would be open to all.

975
01:28:19,591 --> 01:28:29,595
[SPEAKER_33]: In terms of parking enforcement, we are allowed to enforce parking on campus, and we do do that.

976
01:28:30,295 --> 01:28:40,798
[SPEAKER_33]: The rideshare locations, my understanding is that is on a public street, which is Boston Avenue, so that would be enforced by the Medford Police Department.

977
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:47,621
[SPEAKER_33]: But what I would say is that this project is located adjacent to the Tufts University

978
01:28:48,581 --> 01:28:59,567
[SPEAKER_33]: police department, and they work in very close coordination with the Medford Police Department on many issues, parking and traffic being two of them.

979
01:29:00,367 --> 01:29:04,029
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'll defer to Pat on anything I may have missed.

980
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:17,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I might suggest on condition number 14, to Rocco's point, if we can add in language to the effect of Tufts University Police Department

981
01:29:18,879 --> 01:29:41,570
[SPEAKER_08]: will cooperate with the Medford Police Department with respect to enforcement of traffic requirements in front of the- You're like a scenographer.

982
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:43,831
[SPEAKER_20]: You're doing great, Danielle.

983
01:29:45,337 --> 01:29:46,757
[SPEAKER_20]: I see Ben's hand is back up.

984
01:29:46,957 --> 01:29:49,218
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you have any back and forth?

985
01:29:49,418 --> 01:29:58,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I do, and I appreciate, thanks for the time, Madam Chair, and I appreciate Rocco's response on the shuttle service.

986
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:08,862
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope it doesn't come across as unnecessarily nitpicky, but I do believe it would be in the public's interest to have a little bit of specificity around things like

987
01:30:09,993 --> 01:30:18,678
[SPEAKER_13]: hours of operation is, does that only run, you know, during the sort of standard semesters when students are on campus?

988
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:25,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it all the time where Medford residents can benefit?

989
01:30:28,143 --> 01:30:35,767
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's possible, I realize some of those details might not be sorted out just yet fully, but I do think it'd be in the public's interest to understand

990
01:30:37,567 --> 01:30:42,988
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, what is offered in this condition or what is committed to.

991
01:30:43,008 --> 01:30:50,410
[SPEAKER_20]: Does the applicant have any insight?

992
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:58,272
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, building off your point, Ben, it may benefit us to establish like minimum levels of service here.

993
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:05,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Does the applicant have any insight on

994
01:31:06,325 --> 01:31:10,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to take 20 more seconds on this, if I may, Emily.

995
01:31:11,648 --> 01:31:16,890
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason that I keep bringing it up is I view this as a real benefit to the citizens of Medford.

996
01:31:17,531 --> 01:31:22,773
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is a real compelling condition that Tufts has put forward.

997
01:31:23,073 --> 01:31:30,017
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I just am hoping for a little bit of additional detail because I do think that there's a public benefit here.

998
01:31:32,155 --> 01:31:33,336
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Ben.

999
01:31:33,356 --> 01:31:35,298
[SPEAKER_33]: That's an excellent question.

1000
01:31:35,598 --> 01:31:52,354
[SPEAKER_33]: And yeah, it would be none of those things are finalized, but we would try to make it consistent with our Davis Square shuttle, which does operate during the academic year.

1001
01:31:52,514 --> 01:31:53,796
[SPEAKER_33]: It is not year round.

1002
01:31:57,088 --> 01:32:01,871
[SPEAKER_33]: And so, but that is always, you know, something to change as well.

1003
01:32:01,931 --> 01:32:14,419
[SPEAKER_33]: So I just want to, you know, make sure that I'm being, you know, totally transparent, but, um, yeah, it's, it's usually during, um, the academic year, um, that it operates.

1004
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,361
[SPEAKER_33]: Thanks for the clarification.

1005
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:18,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ben.

1006
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:25,226
[SPEAKER_20]: Ben, would you like those specific details entered into the conditions here?

1007
01:32:27,725 --> 01:32:29,885
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't see a downside to it.

1008
01:32:29,986 --> 01:32:30,666
[SPEAKER_13]: It can't hurt.

1009
01:32:31,566 --> 01:32:34,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to have, you know, overkill on this.

1010
01:32:35,107 --> 01:32:39,688
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, at least establishing minimum conditions, you know, free shuttle service that operates.

1011
01:32:39,948 --> 01:32:42,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if there is, yeah, sorry to cut you off.

1012
01:32:42,888 --> 01:32:43,348
[SPEAKER_13]: No, go for it.

1013
01:32:43,508 --> 01:32:43,848
[SPEAKER_13]: You got it.

1014
01:32:44,449 --> 01:32:51,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if it's some wording along the lines of, you know, consistent with existing shuttle service or to be sort of like, you know,

1015
01:32:52,253 --> 01:32:59,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Co termed or I don't know the exact wording that's appropriate, but something saying, you know consistent with what's provided to Davis Square.

1016
01:33:01,741 --> 01:33:03,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I make a suggestion manager?

1017
01:33:04,683 --> 01:33:07,406
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure, and then we'll go to a board member Fishman.

1018
01:33:09,407 --> 01:33:10,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I would suggest just to not.

1019
01:33:12,628 --> 01:33:15,469
[SPEAKER_08]: be too prescriptive given that this is still being determined.

1020
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:28,256
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could add something to condition 13 saying that the applicant intends to operate the shuttle service consistent with the existing Davis Square shuttle, if that would be acceptable.

1021
01:33:29,577 --> 01:33:30,757
[SPEAKER_13]: That seems reasonable to me.

1022
01:33:30,957 --> 01:33:31,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Pat.

1023
01:33:32,218 --> 01:33:35,800
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and then it allows for changes within the Davis Square shuttle service as well.

1024
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:42,170
[SPEAKER_20]: board member Fishman.

1025
01:33:43,631 --> 01:33:49,472
[SPEAKER_21]: I do also want to flag that I maybe saw board member Annie go off of mute.

1026
01:33:49,952 --> 01:34:10,098
[SPEAKER_21]: But my question was if Rocco could speak to openness to any behavioral conditions of the expectations of students and residents around light and noise impacts on the neighborhood that are not inherent in the physical structure.

1027
01:34:11,995 --> 01:34:15,542
[SPEAKER_20]: And I believe we still have that question hanging out there in terms of what noise.

1028
01:34:15,622 --> 01:34:20,671
[SPEAKER_20]: We have light mitigation, but is there noise mitigation we can also build into these conditions?

1029
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,562
[SPEAKER_33]: Uh, thank you for that question.

1030
01:34:24,582 --> 01:34:25,363
[SPEAKER_33]: That's a good question.

1031
01:34:25,783 --> 01:34:37,896
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, yeah, so all of our students are subject to a code of conduct, which they sign and that includes things like, you know, proper behavior, um, and controlling for noise levels on campus.

1032
01:34:38,596 --> 01:34:43,822
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, and as I've discussed this particular location is adjacent to the Tufts University.

1033
01:34:44,442 --> 01:34:45,403
[SPEAKER_33]: police department.

1034
01:34:45,643 --> 01:34:52,666
[SPEAKER_33]: So if there is ever any noise violations or noise concerns, TPD is open 24 seven.

1035
01:34:53,126 --> 01:35:00,849
[SPEAKER_33]: And that's the the immediate number that neighbors can call to make sure that noise is well regulated on campus.

1036
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:06,492
[SPEAKER_20]: I think going back to the

1037
01:35:08,512 --> 01:35:10,714
[SPEAKER_20]: more proactive noise mitigation?

1038
01:35:10,734 --> 01:35:29,249
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, yes, neighbors can call the hotline and, you know, march across the street, but are there conditions that we can build into this document, thinking about the materiality of windows, of walls to help mitigate noise?

1039
01:35:32,232 --> 01:35:33,894
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may make a suggestion, Madam Chair.

1040
01:35:34,314 --> 01:35:35,495
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1041
01:35:36,376 --> 01:35:52,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the best we can probably do in that regard is to agree to a condition that Tufts will enforce its code of conduct in the same manner that it enforces its code of conduct at its existing dorms.

1042
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:54,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would just highlight

1043
01:35:55,552 --> 01:36:11,160
[SPEAKER_08]: to the point of building materiality that, as we've discussed throughout the public hearing process, given the design of the building and the passive house nature of the building, it is going to be extremely well sealed.

1044
01:36:12,421 --> 01:36:15,103
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that will go a long way.

1045
01:36:16,015 --> 01:36:17,537
[SPEAKER_08]: to protecting noise village.

1046
01:36:18,458 --> 01:36:27,006
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly, we can agree to a condition that we would enforce the student code of conduct in the same manner as Tufts existing doors.

1047
01:36:29,529 --> 01:36:30,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Any thoughts on that, Ari?

1048
01:36:35,569 --> 01:36:36,169
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not perfect.

1049
01:36:36,809 --> 01:36:42,410
[SPEAKER_21]: It feels like a bit of a non-answer in terms of to the same standards as present.

1050
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:55,753
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't live within a block of tough students, but from what I've heard and my understanding is there are certainly regular complaints from neighbors and frustrations.

1051
01:36:56,633 --> 01:37:03,995
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know that upholding to the current standards is actually going to achieve what I'm hoping.

1052
01:37:14,898 --> 01:37:18,699
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie, I do want to go back to you if you had any insight.

1053
01:37:19,019 --> 01:37:25,261
[SPEAKER_20]: I recognize that Ari recognized you coming off mute, so I want to give you some space there.

1054
01:37:33,884 --> 01:37:34,785
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have anything to add?

1055
01:37:34,805 --> 01:37:42,007
[SPEAKER_31]: Emily, did you refer to me?

1056
01:37:42,776 --> 01:37:43,636
[SPEAKER_31]: I did, yes.

1057
01:37:43,817 --> 01:37:44,697
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1058
01:37:44,757 --> 01:37:45,657
[SPEAKER_31]: That's OK.

1059
01:37:47,138 --> 01:37:57,663
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that what Ari was saying, what Ben was saying, and what you were saying clearly identifies the pros and cons of the project.

1060
01:37:58,704 --> 01:38:08,709
[SPEAKER_31]: I personally don't see how you can enforce light mitigation on shades on students in dorm rooms.

1061
01:38:09,409 --> 01:38:11,050
[SPEAKER_31]: I just think it's a problem.

1062
01:38:12,075 --> 01:38:14,296
[SPEAKER_31]: You're looking for a unicorn to do that.

1063
01:38:16,137 --> 01:38:20,060
[SPEAKER_31]: But I do agree with everything that has been said.

1064
01:38:22,721 --> 01:38:32,347
[SPEAKER_31]: It concerns me about the shade for the neighborhood will be quite significant.

1065
01:38:34,128 --> 01:38:41,112
[SPEAKER_31]: I think very early in the project, that should have been taken into consideration from the beginning.

1066
01:38:42,586 --> 01:38:49,609
[SPEAKER_31]: and needs to be addressed in a way that's actually going to help the community.

1067
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:59,973
[SPEAKER_20]: I think looking at the zoning for the parcel, the use, the height is allowable.

1068
01:39:06,129 --> 01:39:15,771
[SPEAKER_20]: And I hear the community's concerns in terms of the significant impact that this building will have on their exposure to sunlight.

1069
01:39:17,951 --> 01:39:35,354
[SPEAKER_20]: But that is not something that is under question here based on our understanding of the Community Development Board's mandate, as well as the questions in front of us, which is the Dover Amendment, parking, and setbacks.

1070
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:41,023
[SPEAKER_31]: The Dover Amendment, I think, is very clear, very firm, very actual.

1071
01:39:41,143 --> 01:39:45,646
[SPEAKER_31]: And I've seen it done in other communities with other college campuses.

1072
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:46,967
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

1073
01:39:48,028 --> 01:40:04,520
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think we're going to condition away the building height, nor add conditions within our jurisdiction that address the impact of the building on sunlight.

1074
01:40:06,538 --> 01:40:07,419
[SPEAKER_31]: Totally agreed.

1075
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:08,419
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1076
01:40:17,005 --> 01:40:25,932
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that in mind, are there any other modifications to the proposed conditions?

1077
01:40:26,532 --> 01:40:29,794
[SPEAKER_20]: If there are not, I will be looking for

1078
01:40:35,556 --> 01:40:45,139
[SPEAKER_20]: And Attorney Stein, if you have any guidance for us in terms of procedure here, please feel free to jump in.

1079
01:40:45,159 --> 01:40:55,681
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I mean, I think when you're ready for a motion, somebody can make that motion.

1080
01:40:55,701 --> 01:40:57,462
[SPEAKER_22]: And obviously, you want to win.

1081
01:40:57,902 --> 01:41:00,303
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I know you've even articulated

1082
01:41:02,742 --> 01:41:07,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Certain items in the board appears to be in a consensus about at least some of those through your conversation.

1083
01:41:07,326 --> 01:41:20,436
[SPEAKER_22]: But I do recommend that a motion contain the basic findings or that they be articulated as part of the board's ultimate vote and decision on the 2 issues under the ordinance.

1084
01:41:20,916 --> 01:41:25,780
[SPEAKER_22]: And obviously that it be subject to the conditions discussed today with the changes discussed.

1085
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:52,032
[SPEAKER_20]: and you know also and i'm not sure how you normally do it but maybe an authorization that you as the chair authorized to work with city staff to get the you know decision in final form and signed okay so the first motion that we'd be looking for is a motion to approve the site plan based on the findings that the use is a protected educational use under the dover amendment and that the proposed setbacks

1086
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:56,432
[SPEAKER_20]: And parking locations are reasonable subject to the conditions.

1087
01:41:57,192 --> 01:41:59,454
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have already read the conditions aloud.

1088
01:41:59,514 --> 01:42:01,455
[SPEAKER_20]: We've, we've modified them.

1089
01:42:04,777 --> 01:42:07,619
[SPEAKER_20]: Do I have a motion from a member of the board?

1090
01:42:17,053 --> 01:42:25,435
[SPEAKER_20]: And I recognize that there is limited enthusiasm attached to this project because of the limitations placed on the board.

1091
01:42:25,455 --> 01:42:34,477
[SPEAKER_20]: With that being said, we do need to respect the applicant's right to move this project forward.

1092
01:42:35,198 --> 01:42:38,018
[SPEAKER_20]: We've continued this public hearing multiple times.

1093
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:43,120
[SPEAKER_20]: If we agree that this project

1094
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:48,352
[SPEAKER_20]: is a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment.

1095
01:42:49,373 --> 01:42:55,459
[SPEAKER_20]: And we also agree with the proposed setbacks and parking locations.

1096
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:00,264
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't see a world in which we continue.

1097
01:43:00,284 --> 01:43:09,513
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, of course, the board is welcome to vote either way, you know, if the motion is put ahead in front of us.

1098
01:43:29,632 --> 01:43:31,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle, Alicia, I'm not sure what to do.

1099
01:43:31,992 --> 01:43:35,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a procedural thing, Emily.

1100
01:43:35,193 --> 01:43:46,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I'm technically an alternate, but because of the numbers today, I'm unclear procedurally if I can make the motion or not.

1101
01:43:50,636 --> 01:43:51,676
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, Danielle, we can't hear you.

1102
01:43:55,297 --> 01:43:56,437
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe you are able to, though.

1103
01:43:59,825 --> 01:44:00,686
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what is that?

1104
01:44:00,746 --> 01:44:04,848
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, Emily, I think you can make the motion.

1105
01:44:04,908 --> 01:44:07,209
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see the reason why the chair can't make a motion.

1106
01:44:07,229 --> 01:44:07,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1107
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:23,138
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so at this time, I will make a motion to approve the site plan based on the findings that the use is a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment, and that the proposed setbacks and parking locations are reasonable, subject to the conditions.

1108
01:44:24,619 --> 01:44:25,740
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm looking for a second.

1109
01:44:27,164 --> 01:44:34,710
[SPEAKER_22]: And you just want to add that with the board authorizing you to be able to finalize this with planning staff, get the decision finalized and filed and signed?

1110
01:44:35,730 --> 01:44:36,751
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure.

1111
01:44:36,951 --> 01:44:40,374
[SPEAKER_20]: With authorizing me to finalize based on the decision here this evening.

1112
01:44:41,714 --> 01:44:43,176
[SPEAKER_31]: I will second that motion.

1113
01:44:43,936 --> 01:44:44,537
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Annie.

1114
01:44:45,257 --> 01:44:46,778
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

1115
01:44:52,722 --> 01:44:53,523
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari Fishman.

1116
01:44:57,841 --> 01:44:59,242
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not happy about it.

1117
01:45:07,089 --> 01:45:11,513
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I will vote to abstain if that is allowed, or will that mean we don't have quorum?

1118
01:45:12,874 --> 01:45:13,915
[SPEAKER_31]: We won't have quorum.

1119
01:45:15,456 --> 01:45:17,618
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle, Alicia, do you have any insight there?

1120
01:45:17,638 --> 01:45:21,141
[SPEAKER_20]: I know we're low on numbers this evening.

1121
01:45:21,421 --> 01:45:23,143
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam Chair, I think you will.

1122
01:45:25,191 --> 01:45:28,934
[SPEAKER_32]: As you and Sabrina missed a meeting, can you state for the record?

1123
01:45:28,954 --> 01:45:33,517
[SPEAKER_32]: Can you watch the missing meeting?

1124
01:45:33,597 --> 01:45:42,264
[SPEAKER_32]: And I will be getting you the attestation to have along with this decision.

1125
01:45:42,284 --> 01:45:45,046
[SPEAKER_32]: Hold on one second.

1126
01:46:02,613 --> 01:46:07,238
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, the members have to certify in writing that you've examined all the evidence.

1127
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:09,681
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to do the Mullin certification before you vote.

1128
01:46:13,486 --> 01:46:14,847
[SPEAKER_22]: Why don't we take a recess then?

1129
01:46:14,867 --> 01:46:16,029
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's turn your time.

1130
01:46:16,049 --> 01:46:16,709
[SPEAKER_20]: This is new to me.

1131
01:46:18,464 --> 01:46:31,610
[SPEAKER_22]: So the statute says before any such vote, the member shall certify in writing that he has examined all evidence received at the missed session, which evidence shall include an audio or video recording of the missed session or a transcript thereof.

1132
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:34,712
[SPEAKER_22]: Certifications shall be part of the record of the hearing.

1133
01:46:35,372 --> 01:46:38,153
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you haven't done that, we can take a five minute recess.

1134
01:46:38,173 --> 01:46:41,895
[SPEAKER_22]: You can email it in, but you are supposed to have made the certification writing before you vote.

1135
01:46:43,941 --> 01:46:45,742
[SPEAKER_15]: I wasn't aware that that was an issue.

1136
01:46:45,782 --> 01:46:51,104
[SPEAKER_15]: You just implied this, but literally, they don't have to write on a piece of paper and sign it.

1137
01:46:51,184 --> 01:46:53,365
[SPEAKER_15]: They can email that to Danielle.

1138
01:46:55,066 --> 01:46:57,447
[SPEAKER_22]: It says in writing, that's what it says.

1139
01:46:57,927 --> 01:46:59,288
[SPEAKER_22]: And emails are writing.

1140
01:46:59,868 --> 01:47:02,469
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I mean, as long as the applicant's comfortable with that.

1141
01:47:06,391 --> 01:47:11,653
[SPEAKER_22]: And just to clarify, is Ben a voting member on this one, or do you actually only have four votes this evening?

1142
01:47:13,712 --> 01:47:14,813
[SPEAKER_22]: Ben is an alternate.

1143
01:47:16,755 --> 01:47:27,485
[SPEAKER_32]: An alternate, so he's an associate member votes in place of a full member when we don't have a full board president.

1144
01:47:27,965 --> 01:47:32,969
[SPEAKER_22]: So we have five of the seven, you need four for an approval.

1145
01:47:35,452 --> 01:47:36,913
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you are a seven member board.

1146
01:47:37,434 --> 01:47:38,855
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is a simple majority vote.

1147
01:47:47,226 --> 01:47:50,948
[SPEAKER_22]: So just to clarify, this is constituted, correct, as a seven-member board.

1148
01:47:51,488 --> 01:47:51,728
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1149
01:47:52,468 --> 01:47:58,951
[SPEAKER_22]: With two associate spots for a total potentially of nine people involved, but it's a seven regular members.

1150
01:48:01,332 --> 01:48:05,694
[SPEAKER_22]: And a simple majority then would be four votes in the affirmative in order to grant this.

1151
01:48:13,669 --> 01:48:14,729
[SPEAKER_20]: So what am I supposed to email?

1152
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:18,151
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, you should see that in your inbox, my attestation.

1153
01:48:19,031 --> 01:48:31,797
[SPEAKER_20]: And just for all members of the meeting, I would like to confirm that I watched the recording of the November 20, 2024 meeting, which was part of this process.

1154
01:48:36,739 --> 01:48:39,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Sabrina, are you able to confirm that you watched?

1155
01:48:40,621 --> 01:48:41,281
[SPEAKER_17]: I can confirm.

1156
01:48:41,341 --> 01:48:42,302
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sending my email now.

1157
01:48:43,113 --> 01:48:44,033
[SPEAKER_22]: Great, thank you.

1158
01:48:44,193 --> 01:48:46,654
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll have the writing in place and that's important.

1159
01:48:51,375 --> 01:48:54,415
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just gonna start the roll call over again.

1160
01:48:54,435 --> 01:49:00,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Stein, are we?

1161
01:49:02,857 --> 01:49:07,018
[SPEAKER_20]: As long as the writings have been received.

1162
01:49:07,138 --> 01:49:08,078
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you give us a thumbs up?

1163
01:49:09,838 --> 01:49:11,919
[SPEAKER_31]: Am I supposed to send something as well?

1164
01:49:12,839 --> 01:49:13,519
[SPEAKER_31]: No.

1165
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:13,840
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1166
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,061
[SPEAKER_32]: Annie, you didn't miss any meetings.

1167
01:49:16,681 --> 01:49:16,921
[SPEAKER_31]: Right.

1168
01:49:17,261 --> 01:49:17,641
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1169
01:49:19,362 --> 01:49:22,763
[SPEAKER_31]: I just don't want to confuse things.

1170
01:49:24,104 --> 01:49:24,764
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate it.

1171
01:49:24,804 --> 01:49:25,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1172
01:49:27,525 --> 01:49:28,726
[SPEAKER_32]: I received Emily's.

1173
01:49:33,087 --> 01:49:35,688
[SPEAKER_32]: Confirming that she watched the recording, the 11-20-24 meeting.

1174
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:50,703
[SPEAKER_32]: Sabrina's is working its way through the interwebs.

1175
01:49:51,423 --> 01:49:52,004
[SPEAKER_32]: Here we go.

1176
01:49:59,270 --> 01:50:13,542
[SPEAKER_32]: Member Alpino, her email has been received, attesting that she reviewed the missing material from the November 20th, 24 meeting, and we'll be able to vote on this matter.

1177
01:50:13,562 --> 01:50:14,923
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1178
01:50:16,877 --> 01:50:18,638
[SPEAKER_20]: So just to recap, I have made the motion.

1179
01:50:18,658 --> 01:50:22,020
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie seconded.

1180
01:50:22,981 --> 01:50:24,582
[SPEAKER_20]: We are doing a roll call vote.

1181
01:50:24,862 --> 01:50:25,903
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just going to start at the top.

1182
01:50:27,744 --> 01:50:28,804
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari Fishman.

1183
01:50:28,824 --> 01:50:31,646
[SPEAKER_20]: I am abstaining.

1184
01:50:32,887 --> 01:50:33,287
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1185
01:50:34,648 --> 01:50:35,288
[SPEAKER_20]: Ben Lavallee.

1186
01:50:35,308 --> 01:50:37,430
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm an aye.

1187
01:50:39,091 --> 01:50:39,691
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie Strang.

1188
01:50:40,471 --> 01:50:40,832
[SPEAKER_20]: Nay.

1189
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:44,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Sabrina Alpino.

1190
01:50:46,075 --> 01:50:46,295
[SPEAKER_20]: Nay.

1191
01:50:47,885 --> 01:50:50,667
[SPEAKER_20]: And myself, right?

1192
01:50:52,108 --> 01:50:52,308
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1193
01:50:53,509 --> 01:51:08,460
[SPEAKER_20]: Emily Hedeman, I am an I. So to summarize, we have one abstention, two in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1194
01:51:09,541 --> 01:51:10,521
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that correct, Danielle?

1195
01:51:10,541 --> 01:51:11,462
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that also what you got?

1196
01:51:14,012 --> 01:51:17,735
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Attorney Stein.

1197
01:51:17,935 --> 01:51:18,896
[SPEAKER_32]: What do we do here?

1198
01:51:18,916 --> 01:51:37,591
[SPEAKER_22]: So, the only thing that I would recommend is that the board members voting no, you know, articulate their reasons for the record so that when you prepare a decision and that, you know, their findings, you know.

1199
01:51:38,692 --> 01:52:08,194
[SPEAKER_22]: In there this was obviously a vote made in the affirmative it failed um, you know, it would be helpful for the purposes of the decision to have um findings supporting the decision and again, I would just ask that you authorize Um, you know, unless you want to do it a different way that you authorize emily, uh to have the authority to work with you folks To just get the decision written up and filed Andy or sabrina if either of you would like to

1200
01:52:09,872 --> 01:52:10,312
[SPEAKER_20]: I see.

1201
01:52:10,572 --> 01:52:11,833
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you want to add something, Alicia?

1202
01:52:11,853 --> 01:52:20,234
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I was just going to say that we have to have reasons in the decision to deny it.

1203
01:52:21,074 --> 01:52:22,495
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1204
01:52:22,695 --> 01:52:35,117
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is what Attorney Stein has requested that Annie and Sabrina articulate to help us really, really kind of clarify this decision here.

1205
01:52:35,757 --> 01:52:37,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I able to write?

1206
01:52:37,418 --> 01:52:38,538
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't write a decision.

1207
01:52:39,639 --> 01:52:41,740
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I think Sabrina is about to talk.

1208
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:45,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Am I able to retract the voting or is it just as is?

1209
01:52:46,763 --> 01:52:53,386
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, if you if somebody wants to make a motion to reconsider the vote, you can make a motion to reconsider the vote.

1210
01:52:53,406 --> 01:52:55,667
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you haven't closed out the process yet.

1211
01:52:56,827 --> 01:53:01,930
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the board would vote on whether or not they want to have a reconsideration of the vote and then you can revote the vote.

1212
01:53:04,253 --> 01:53:05,234
[SPEAKER_20]: So that may be an option.

1213
01:53:05,734 --> 01:53:11,760
[SPEAKER_20]: But I would like to give Annie an opportunity to provide some insight on her nay vote.

1214
01:53:13,061 --> 01:53:22,290
[SPEAKER_31]: I thought very deeply about it because Tufts really needs the dorm space.

1215
01:53:24,872 --> 01:53:27,654
[SPEAKER_31]: And in my mind, it has nothing to do with Dover.

1216
01:53:27,714 --> 01:53:30,437
[SPEAKER_31]: I think Dover stands and totally supports

1217
01:53:31,206 --> 01:53:41,169
[SPEAKER_31]: how Dover was crafted, but I'm very uncomfortable about what it's going to do to the neighborhood that has been there a very long time.

1218
01:53:41,809 --> 01:53:47,171
[SPEAKER_31]: And I really think good fences make good neighbors.

1219
01:53:47,571 --> 01:53:54,833
[SPEAKER_31]: And I don't think the two parties will be able to comfortably get along.

1220
01:53:55,073 --> 01:54:00,515
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that from my perspective, it's extremely important to me

1221
01:54:01,753 --> 01:54:10,137
[SPEAKER_31]: that the community that has lived there for a long time has to be seriously taken into consideration.

1222
01:54:10,157 --> 01:54:21,463
[SPEAKER_31]: I have driven up there numerous times, walked around carefully, very carefully considered it right after the last meeting.

1223
01:54:22,424 --> 01:54:29,788
[SPEAKER_31]: And I just am having a real struggle seeing how this was going to work for the community.

1224
01:54:31,853 --> 01:54:33,217
[SPEAKER_31]: and I voted my conscience.

1225
01:54:35,817 --> 01:54:36,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Annie.

1226
01:54:36,437 --> 01:54:37,277
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.

1227
01:54:37,617 --> 01:54:48,240
[SPEAKER_20]: So thinking specifically about the Dover Amendment, just to summarize what I'm hearing is that you are in agreement that it qualifies as a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment.

1228
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:57,742
[SPEAKER_20]: However, the question of reasonable regulations, it sounds like that is where there may be some gaps.

1229
01:54:59,123 --> 01:55:04,884
[SPEAKER_20]: Are there specific regulations that you would like to address or propose?

1230
01:55:07,393 --> 01:55:08,574
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it the setbacks?

1231
01:55:08,594 --> 01:55:11,155
[SPEAKER_32]: Because it has to be the setbacks or the parking.

1232
01:55:11,175 --> 01:55:11,916
[SPEAKER_32]: Or the parking.

1233
01:55:12,176 --> 01:55:12,416
[SPEAKER_20]: Which one?

1234
01:55:12,696 --> 01:55:23,123
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't mean to put you on the spot, but our vote is very important here.

1235
01:55:23,143 --> 01:55:25,484
[SPEAKER_20]: We have very invested community.

1236
01:55:26,525 --> 01:55:29,327
[SPEAKER_20]: We also have a very eager applicant.

1237
01:55:31,028 --> 01:55:32,409
[SPEAKER_20]: It's totally understood.

1238
01:55:32,429 --> 01:55:36,231
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't, like Ari said, I didn't

1239
01:55:36,684 --> 01:55:51,769
[SPEAKER_31]: take this path to be uncooperative or supportive.

1240
01:55:51,909 --> 01:55:52,469
[SPEAKER_31]: Not at all.

1241
01:55:52,489 --> 01:56:01,232
[SPEAKER_31]: I really just am not comfortable with how the regulations, which I'm sure are totally fine,

1242
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:11,904
[SPEAKER_31]: But I just have very strong feelings about the community that has been there a very long time and a very old city like Medford.

1243
01:56:12,905 --> 01:56:30,873
[SPEAKER_31]: And we just have to work out a compromise that not only supports the goals of the university, but frankly, the lives of these people who have invested in their properties and their children grew up in these neighborhoods.

1244
01:56:31,514 --> 01:56:46,545
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm certainly not Solomon, and I don't know how to dissect a baby, but I just know in my conscious, I just can't go there with what's going on.

1245
01:56:46,685 --> 01:56:48,807
[SPEAKER_20]: And to be honest, I can't say I disagree with you.

1246
01:56:50,308 --> 01:56:56,132
[SPEAKER_20]: However, I keep coming back to our powers as a board, and we

1247
01:57:00,915 --> 01:57:03,316
[SPEAKER_20]: The reason this board works is because we apply.

1248
01:57:03,336 --> 01:57:08,277
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, a consistent approach to all applicants.

1249
01:57:09,937 --> 01:57:20,900
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't know, but I think Alicia said it at some point, you know, it's it's it's only fair and right for the applicants to know.

1250
01:57:22,701 --> 01:57:25,922
[SPEAKER_20]: What is expected of them when they come before this board and.

1251
01:57:30,168 --> 01:57:45,012
[SPEAKER_20]: without being able to, I'm not saying you can't vocalize the reasonable regulations, but if there's any insight that you can offer in terms of reasonable regulations that you feel should be imposed on the use related to the setback in the parking.

1252
01:57:45,032 --> 01:57:49,333
[SPEAKER_31]: Other than that, I don't have enough.

1253
01:57:50,873 --> 01:57:59,515
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, could your, this might be more Alicia, Danielle, could the perspective just be she doesn't agree with the relief?

1254
01:58:06,235 --> 01:58:08,057
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I think you've asked the right questions.

1255
01:58:08,337 --> 01:58:09,919
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't answer them for anyone else.

1256
01:58:10,339 --> 01:58:10,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1257
01:58:10,839 --> 01:58:16,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Could we hear from the other member who voted no because Sabrina.

1258
01:58:17,949 --> 01:58:30,577
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, yeah, I totally recognize that this is under the Dover Amendment and I get that, but I think I'm on the same boat that these rules and regulations aren't really protecting the people that live here.

1259
01:58:30,597 --> 01:58:37,601
[SPEAKER_17]: It's almost like it's getting bullied to the point and we kind of have to accept it.

1260
01:58:37,621 --> 01:58:41,503
[SPEAKER_17]: I voted similarly to Annie where I just don't feel as though

1261
01:58:44,641 --> 01:58:46,062
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, the protections aren't there.

1262
01:58:46,082 --> 01:58:52,166
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems like it's easier for the developer or whoever to get the upper hand.

1263
01:58:52,226 --> 01:59:02,994
[SPEAKER_17]: And unfortunately, even with voting, like with my vote, it only has to be for reasonable regulations.

1264
01:59:03,034 --> 01:59:06,316
[SPEAKER_17]: And it can't be for because majority of the people living there don't want it.

1265
01:59:07,237 --> 01:59:08,658
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's where I'm at.

1266
01:59:10,478 --> 01:59:11,759
[SPEAKER_17]: But I would retract.

1267
01:59:12,059 --> 01:59:14,882
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not trying to be difficult, but that's just how I voted in the moment.

1268
01:59:18,465 --> 01:59:20,146
[SPEAKER_20]: Speak to me more about this retraction.

1269
01:59:20,166 --> 01:59:26,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you really know how to do this from a procedural standpoint, Danielle or Alicia?

1270
01:59:26,631 --> 01:59:27,432
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you saying that?

1271
01:59:27,452 --> 01:59:34,738
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we do vote if you want to reconsider the vote, as Attorney Stein said.

1272
01:59:35,198 --> 01:59:35,719
[SPEAKER_32]: Perhaps Ari.

1273
01:59:38,659 --> 01:59:40,419
[SPEAKER_32]: would be willing to make a vote.

1274
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:45,481
[SPEAKER_32]: They went first, so usually.

1275
01:59:45,501 --> 01:59:46,541
[SPEAKER_32]: You can do the opposite order.

1276
01:59:46,561 --> 01:59:46,981
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

1277
01:59:48,542 --> 01:59:48,802
[SPEAKER_32]: OK.

1278
01:59:49,482 --> 01:59:54,643
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do appreciate the pressure that voting first puts on a person.

1279
01:59:54,823 --> 01:59:57,924
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for going first, Ari, last time.

1280
01:59:59,104 --> 02:00:01,845
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'd like to make a motion to reconsider

1281
02:00:02,608 --> 02:00:03,068
[SPEAKER_20]: the vote.

1282
02:00:04,109 --> 02:00:06,851
[SPEAKER_20]: This is by no means pressure to change your vote.

1283
02:00:09,112 --> 02:00:15,177
[SPEAKER_20]: Please vote how you feel that this matter should go.

1284
02:00:15,197 --> 02:00:21,921
[SPEAKER_22]: And just to clarify, the motion to reconsider is a motion in and of itself.

1285
02:00:22,302 --> 02:00:23,823
[SPEAKER_22]: It's who we want to have.

1286
02:00:24,063 --> 02:00:26,384
[SPEAKER_22]: So yeah, just to clarify.

1287
02:00:26,404 --> 02:00:28,986
[SPEAKER_22]: So first, the board would say, do we even want to vote again?

1288
02:00:29,266 --> 02:00:31,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Then you would need a new motion on the application.

1289
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:33,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so maybe let's discuss.

1290
02:00:33,798 --> 02:00:34,759
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we want to vote again?

1291
02:00:34,779 --> 02:00:36,219
[SPEAKER_20]: I would say yes.

1292
02:00:37,299 --> 02:00:38,839
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that would offer clarity to the board.

1293
02:00:38,859 --> 02:00:40,720
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that would offer clarity to the applicant.

1294
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:42,520
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that would offer clarity to the public.

1295
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:45,601
[SPEAKER_20]: But curious other thoughts, board members.

1296
02:00:46,781 --> 02:00:48,381
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm happy to vote again.

1297
02:00:48,461 --> 02:00:55,703
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that it is a complex enough issue that given the additional discussion, if anyone wants to.

1298
02:00:56,746 --> 02:01:01,090
[SPEAKER_21]: change their opinion that is, I have no objections to having that discussion.

1299
02:01:01,310 --> 02:01:01,670
[SPEAKER_21]: Or not.

1300
02:01:01,890 --> 02:01:05,093
[SPEAKER_21]: Or continuing to vote their conscience.

1301
02:01:05,633 --> 02:01:05,833
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1302
02:01:07,135 --> 02:01:07,615
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1303
02:01:09,456 --> 02:01:12,779
[SPEAKER_20]: Ben, Annie, Sabrina, any opinions?

1304
02:01:15,061 --> 02:01:15,241
[SPEAKER_17]: If we.

1305
02:01:15,561 --> 02:01:16,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I'd like to.

1306
02:01:16,702 --> 02:01:16,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1307
02:01:16,863 --> 02:01:22,727
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, seeing overall support.

1308
02:01:24,293 --> 02:01:26,614
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to make a motion to reconsider the vote.

1309
02:01:26,974 --> 02:01:27,734
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll need a second.

1310
02:01:29,334 --> 02:01:30,535
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll second that motion.

1311
02:01:31,555 --> 02:01:32,235
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Annie.

1312
02:01:33,595 --> 02:01:36,316
[SPEAKER_20]: So I will go first.

1313
02:01:37,797 --> 02:01:39,457
[SPEAKER_20]: I, Emily Hedeman, am an aye.

1314
02:01:41,738 --> 02:01:42,338
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie Strang?

1315
02:01:43,438 --> 02:01:44,058
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm an aye.

1316
02:01:45,179 --> 02:01:45,559
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1317
02:01:46,759 --> 02:01:47,439
[SPEAKER_20]: Ben LaValle?

1318
02:01:47,459 --> 02:01:49,460
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm an aye.

1319
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:50,640
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1320
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:52,581
[SPEAKER_20]: Sabrina Alpino?

1321
02:01:52,601 --> 02:01:53,881
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1322
02:01:58,424 --> 02:01:59,845
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, Sabrina, you went on mute.

1323
02:02:00,706 --> 02:02:01,827
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I sorry.

1324
02:02:02,568 --> 02:02:03,349
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Sabrina.

1325
02:02:04,410 --> 02:02:05,611
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari Fishman.

1326
02:02:07,833 --> 02:02:09,315
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will remain in abstention.

1327
02:02:10,536 --> 02:02:11,197
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Ari.

1328
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:19,144
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that, we have one abstention, one in the negative, two in the affirmative.

1329
02:02:21,387 --> 02:02:22,508
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia, I see a face.

1330
02:02:23,497 --> 02:02:24,958
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it's three in the affirmative.

1331
02:02:25,038 --> 02:02:25,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Three in the affirmative.

1332
02:02:26,298 --> 02:02:28,700
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought that was the vote to reconsider.

1333
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:32,382
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to vote to reconsider and then you have to- That was.

1334
02:02:32,402 --> 02:02:33,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, oh, sorry.

1335
02:02:33,722 --> 02:02:35,363
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm happy to, I misunderstood.

1336
02:02:35,403 --> 02:02:36,624
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm voting to reconsider that.

1337
02:02:36,744 --> 02:02:37,884
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not abstaining on that one.

1338
02:02:38,165 --> 02:02:39,685
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I'm happy to reconsider.

1339
02:02:39,925 --> 02:02:40,186
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1340
02:02:41,206 --> 02:02:43,988
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, okay, do we need to do that again?

1341
02:02:44,008 --> 02:02:47,850
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think we all got confused.

1342
02:02:47,990 --> 02:02:48,230
[SPEAKER_31]: Right.

1343
02:02:48,350 --> 02:02:49,511
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1344
02:02:49,531 --> 02:02:53,573
[SPEAKER_20]: And huge appreciation of patience for the public for the applicant.

1345
02:02:54,954 --> 02:02:57,155
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that this is a deeply personal issue.

1346
02:02:57,335 --> 02:02:59,937
[SPEAKER_20]: So please know that we're not taking this lightly.

1347
02:03:01,978 --> 02:03:09,002
[SPEAKER_20]: So the motion in front of us, I'm asking for a motion to reconsider the vote.

1348
02:03:11,809 --> 02:03:13,890
[SPEAKER_20]: I will make the motion to reconsider the vote.

1349
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:15,811
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm looking for a second.

1350
02:03:16,491 --> 02:03:19,252
[SPEAKER_31]: I will second the motion to reconsider the vote.

1351
02:03:20,292 --> 02:03:21,053
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Annie.

1352
02:03:24,234 --> 02:03:28,576
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going to do a roll call vote and the motion in front of us is to reconsider the vote.

1353
02:03:30,056 --> 02:03:30,837
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie String?

1354
02:03:32,137 --> 02:03:32,197
[SPEAKER_31]: Aye.

1355
02:03:33,798 --> 02:03:34,498
[SPEAKER_20]: Ben Lavallee?

1356
02:03:34,518 --> 02:03:36,099
[SPEAKER_31]: Aye.

1357
02:03:37,419 --> 02:03:38,299
[SPEAKER_20]: Sabrina Alpino?

1358
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:39,440
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1359
02:03:40,930 --> 02:03:41,391
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1360
02:03:41,591 --> 02:03:42,251
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari Fishman?

1361
02:03:42,932 --> 02:03:43,092
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1362
02:03:43,853 --> 02:03:48,819
[SPEAKER_20]: And I, myself, Emily Henneman, am also an aye in the motion to reconsider the vote.

1363
02:03:50,981 --> 02:03:53,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Now we need to make another motion, or do we just open it up?

1364
02:03:56,167 --> 02:03:57,528
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we're supposed to be.

1365
02:03:58,543 --> 02:04:05,086
[SPEAKER_22]: You can, if you're ready, I mean, you can restate the original motion that's being reconsidered.

1366
02:04:05,106 --> 02:04:06,667
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know that you have to say all the words again.

1367
02:04:06,707 --> 02:04:09,048
[SPEAKER_22]: You can just say, you know, I'm making the motion again.

1368
02:04:09,148 --> 02:04:10,648
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to say all the words.

1369
02:04:12,129 --> 02:04:13,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1370
02:04:15,390 --> 02:04:19,032
[SPEAKER_20]: So I am looking, oh, Ben, I see your hand.

1371
02:04:19,952 --> 02:04:22,954
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there something we need to discuss before we go into this?

1372
02:04:24,362 --> 02:04:38,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Not necessarily, but I do want to make note of the fact that Pat Gallagher has his hand raised and at least open the door to allowing Pat to speak before any re-vote.

1373
02:04:39,692 --> 02:04:44,595
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Gallagher, can you give me a one-sentence summary of what you're looking to talk about?

1374
02:04:44,615 --> 02:04:49,438
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we may or may not allow the comment.

1375
02:04:51,437 --> 02:04:52,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1376
02:04:52,977 --> 02:04:58,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to make a legal point on what the ordinance and the Zoning Act states.

1377
02:05:14,022 --> 02:05:18,643
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll allow it because I think that it's important for us to be super clear.

1378
02:05:19,943 --> 02:05:26,285
[SPEAKER_20]: on the issues, especially the ones that are raised by the public of which the zoning is one.

1379
02:05:27,645 --> 02:05:28,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1380
02:05:28,585 --> 02:05:31,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.

1381
02:05:35,167 --> 02:05:37,808
[SPEAKER_08]: None of us here writes the laws.

1382
02:05:40,588 --> 02:05:47,410
[SPEAKER_08]: But we came into this process based on what the law is when we filed our application.

1383
02:05:49,410 --> 02:06:06,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we filed our application, what the law in the city of Medford says is that a dormitory use can be constructed on this site in an apartments two district to a height of up to 125 feet.

1384
02:06:09,048 --> 02:06:15,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And in addition to that, this is a use protected by the Dover Amendment, which is a law that was established

1385
02:06:16,845 --> 02:06:20,866
[SPEAKER_08]: to protect against these types of uses being discriminated against.

1386
02:06:24,047 --> 02:06:36,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to just, we have been through this process with everyone here and we have heard everything that has been said.

1387
02:06:36,911 --> 02:06:44,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are some things that we don't agree on, but I think we need to respect what the law says.

1388
02:06:45,603 --> 02:06:54,588
[SPEAKER_08]: And the law says that on this site, we are permitted to build the building that has been proposed here before the board.

1389
02:06:56,289 --> 02:06:57,390
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Attorney Gallagher.

1390
02:06:57,430 --> 02:07:00,972
[SPEAKER_20]: The board will keep that in mind as we move forward.

1391
02:07:05,055 --> 02:07:09,737
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I also just, I would like to clarify, um,

1392
02:07:13,419 --> 02:07:34,854
[SPEAKER_22]: Just a quantum of vote on this issue, because I am looking at your site plan review ordinance under 94-11-8, which governs this particular section of the store member site plan review.

1393
02:07:35,965 --> 02:07:36,425
[SPEAKER_22]: 9-11-8-4.

1394
02:07:36,685 --> 02:07:50,973
[SPEAKER_22]: It says that the Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with General Law Chapter 48, Section 11 and reach its written decision reached by a majority vote of the Board as constituted.

1395
02:07:52,317 --> 02:08:00,682
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and just to clarify, in my opinion, the ordinance does control over any, like, local rules and this is a 7 member board.

1396
02:08:01,242 --> 02:08:06,925
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I believe that a majority of the 7 member board, the 4 members are the vote that are needed to approve.

1397
02:08:10,487 --> 02:08:12,708
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I understand there may be a question about that.

1398
02:08:12,728 --> 02:08:13,489
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1399
02:08:13,909 --> 02:08:15,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, but.

1400
02:08:16,548 --> 02:08:41,997
[SPEAKER_22]: In my opinion if there's a conflict between the ordinance and any kind of local rule or community development board rule Um, which I believe there may be a question about I think the ordinance would control because rules and regulations have to within the scope of an ordinance Okay, so in summary if If this motion was to pass meaning

1401
02:08:43,137 --> 02:08:53,561
[SPEAKER_20]: Confirmed educational use, per the Community Development Board, confirmed educational use, as well as relief for setbacks in parking.

1402
02:08:53,721 --> 02:09:00,643
[SPEAKER_20]: We would need four members of the board to vote in the affirmative, regardless of how many board members are present today.

1403
02:09:02,645 --> 02:09:06,987
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I mean the it says the majority vote of the board has constituted in my opinion.

1404
02:09:07,047 --> 02:09:12,570
[SPEAKER_22]: It's constituted as a seven member board Regardless of how many seats are filled or how many people are here?

1405
02:09:12,590 --> 02:09:26,898
[SPEAKER_22]: And my opinion is the ordinance itself would control The quantum of votes and just for this particular vote so seeing that I mean, I I think at that point

1406
02:09:28,048 --> 02:09:38,095
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the applicant got a little bit of a preview of the way the board may be leaning and the prior vote the first time we voted on the motion.

1407
02:09:38,115 --> 02:09:53,225
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Stein, do you think it makes sense to put it forth to the applicant if they would like to continue this matter or if they would like us to vote this evening?

1408
02:09:53,405 --> 02:09:56,627
[SPEAKER_20]: And this question is for Attorney Stein and Attorney Stein only.

1409
02:09:58,025 --> 02:10:01,667
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not looking for input from just if we should pose this question.

1410
02:10:03,708 --> 02:10:06,269
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't, I don't think I can answer that question.

1411
02:10:06,289 --> 02:10:09,071
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's, um, that's.

1412
02:10:11,372 --> 02:10:12,233
[SPEAKER_22]: It's up to the board.

1413
02:10:12,293 --> 02:10:14,774
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want to make a motion, it's up to the board.

1414
02:10:14,814 --> 02:10:16,955
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want to hear from the applicant on that issue.

1415
02:10:18,176 --> 02:10:20,757
[SPEAKER_22]: Respectfully, I just don't think that's something that I can weigh in on.

1416
02:10:21,378 --> 02:10:22,058
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

1417
02:10:28,124 --> 02:10:29,825
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to look to my fellow board members here.

1418
02:10:35,628 --> 02:10:37,829
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it does pose the question.

1419
02:10:37,849 --> 02:10:52,656
[SPEAKER_20]: It does make sense to pose the question to the applicant to just confirm that they would like this motion to be evaluated this evening, but also

1420
02:10:54,246 --> 02:10:56,588
[SPEAKER_20]: I am not the only member of the board.

1421
02:10:56,628 --> 02:10:59,990
[SPEAKER_20]: So Annie, Ben, Ari, Sabrina.

1422
02:11:00,010 --> 02:11:08,916
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

1423
02:11:11,898 --> 02:11:12,159
[SPEAKER_31]: I know.

1424
02:11:12,179 --> 02:11:16,081
[SPEAKER_31]: I honestly don't know how to respond, Emily.

1425
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:16,602
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

1426
02:11:24,395 --> 02:11:28,096
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, this was something that I guess I wish we had known at the outside of the meeting.

1427
02:11:28,116 --> 02:11:35,357
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that would have changed things a little bit.

1428
02:11:41,418 --> 02:11:50,760
[SPEAKER_31]: So just to be clear, from what has just been said, we really should have seven people voting.

1429
02:11:54,466 --> 02:11:57,369
[SPEAKER_31]: Does that mean we can't vote today with the amount?

1430
02:11:57,610 --> 02:11:59,452
[SPEAKER_20]: No, we can vote.

1431
02:12:02,655 --> 02:12:11,765
[SPEAKER_31]: But you're asking if Mr. Gallagher would rather us take it?

1432
02:12:12,953 --> 02:12:31,678
[SPEAKER_15]: later yeah yeah so more members of the board can be here melisha i see your hand i so here's the problem there can't be more members of the board because you cannot appoint somebody in the middle of a public hearing so we're we're down a member okay jackie stepped off yeah

1433
02:12:32,771 --> 02:12:35,932
[SPEAKER_15]: and you cannot appoint somebody in the middle of a public hearing.

1434
02:12:36,652 --> 02:12:49,077
[SPEAKER_15]: So the Mullen rule doesn't work for you weren't on the board because that would, if you could just imagine you have a board and then you appoint purpose because they're going to vote a certain way in the middle.

1435
02:12:49,097 --> 02:12:49,877
[SPEAKER_15]: What about Adam?

1436
02:12:52,258 --> 02:12:55,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Would he, has he only missed this one meeting?

1437
02:12:55,559 --> 02:12:58,381
[SPEAKER_15]: It would only have been this one.

1438
02:12:59,281 --> 02:13:02,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the Mullen rule can only apply to one meeting.

1439
02:13:04,275 --> 02:13:18,922
[SPEAKER_20]: So theoretically, Adam, if full board attendance, and again, respecting that we cannot appoint an additional member, and I agree that would be a huge conflict, so don't want to do that.

1440
02:13:21,463 --> 02:13:27,826
[SPEAKER_20]: We could theoretically have board member barons join at the next meeting.

1441
02:13:28,187 --> 02:13:30,748
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this point, I do want to ask the applicant

1442
02:13:31,632 --> 02:13:33,854
[SPEAKER_15]: May I make a statement on behalf of the city?

1443
02:13:33,874 --> 02:13:34,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Totally.

1444
02:13:35,816 --> 02:13:43,822
[SPEAKER_15]: So I, it is not, it is not my intention to pressure people.

1445
02:13:44,563 --> 02:13:52,129
[SPEAKER_15]: On the other hand, the city, so if this is denied, it is reasonable to assume that Tufts would appeal as they have before.

1446
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:55,292
[SPEAKER_15]: The city would have to spend resources to defend it.

1447
02:13:55,645 --> 02:14:03,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia, I don't want you to continue this because at the same time, yes, the applicant has rights and resources, but so does the public.

1448
02:14:04,193 --> 02:14:05,894
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand why you are saying this.

1449
02:14:07,636 --> 02:14:11,880
[SPEAKER_20]: But I do not want that to continue respectfully.

1450
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:13,341
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1451
02:14:15,203 --> 02:14:15,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle.

1452
02:14:17,813 --> 02:14:18,574
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1453
02:14:19,414 --> 02:14:24,157
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to raise the issue that if it's continued, we could- I can't hear you.

1454
02:14:24,177 --> 02:14:26,639
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know why this- Oh, there.

1455
02:14:26,659 --> 02:14:27,339
[SPEAKER_32]: Now I can hear you.

1456
02:14:27,820 --> 02:14:28,460
[SPEAKER_32]: Now we can hear you.

1457
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,241
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know why my mic isn't picking me up.

1458
02:14:30,902 --> 02:14:40,108
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to add that if we continue it, we might run into quorum issues as someone could miss them, could be absent at that meeting.

1459
02:14:40,348 --> 02:14:43,450
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't think we've ever had full attendance.

1460
02:14:44,650 --> 02:14:46,892
[SPEAKER_32]: at any of our meetings, so we can't guarantee.

1461
02:14:46,912 --> 02:14:47,933
[SPEAKER_32]: It is a challenge.

1462
02:14:48,133 --> 02:14:50,095
[SPEAKER_32]: Someone could be sick, who knows.

1463
02:14:50,476 --> 02:14:53,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so keeping that in mind, I'd like to pose it to the applicant.

1464
02:14:53,999 --> 02:14:55,440
[SPEAKER_20]: I see Attorney Gallagher's hands.

1465
02:14:57,202 --> 02:14:58,323
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have any preference?

1466
02:14:58,403 --> 02:15:08,693
[SPEAKER_20]: And understanding that this is not the applicant telling the board what to do, we are just trying to survey kind of the entire situation here.

1467
02:15:10,696 --> 02:15:11,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1468
02:15:11,779 --> 02:15:14,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand it would be our preference to continue.

1469
02:15:15,930 --> 02:15:16,191
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1470
02:15:29,969 --> 02:15:33,072
[SPEAKER_22]: Emily before the board would consider a motion and continue.

1471
02:15:33,092 --> 02:15:36,475
[SPEAKER_22]: Can we just clarify at this point the status of the public hearing?

1472
02:15:36,995 --> 02:15:47,564
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, because obviously decisions are tied to the close of the public hearing the public should be aware at this point or if you consider the public the whole public hearing closed And this is just board deliberation.

1473
02:15:47,584 --> 02:15:52,448
[SPEAKER_22]: You'd be continuing for continued board deliberation Or are you keeping?

1474
02:15:53,409 --> 02:15:57,932
[SPEAKER_22]: the hearing open for some reason and that you're going to be taking an additional public comment in the future.

1475
02:15:57,952 --> 02:16:03,356
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to make sure we're really clear with everybody that's on the Zoom, what expectations would be on a continuance?

1476
02:16:04,397 --> 02:16:18,987
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would say the public hearing is closed and we would be looking for any additional board deliberations and to vote on a motion.

1477
02:16:21,186 --> 02:16:22,787
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for that clarification.

1478
02:16:23,648 --> 02:16:23,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1479
02:16:24,849 --> 02:16:26,650
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm in favor of continuing.

1480
02:16:28,372 --> 02:16:31,834
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that that's not anybody's favorite answer.

1481
02:16:31,854 --> 02:16:35,377
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not mine.

1482
02:16:36,718 --> 02:16:47,827
[SPEAKER_20]: But given the update that the whole board, all seven, would have to be considered, and not just the members in attendance tonight,

1483
02:16:50,568 --> 02:16:59,510
[SPEAKER_20]: That being said, so late in the meeting, I'm not comfortable voting, but also interested in what the board has to say.

1484
02:16:59,530 --> 02:17:07,893
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm open to continuing.

1485
02:17:07,913 --> 02:17:07,953
[SPEAKER_31]: OK.

1486
02:17:09,613 --> 02:17:17,575
[SPEAKER_31]: So am I. And if Jackie's no longer part of the voting group, then are we six?

1487
02:17:17,875 --> 02:17:19,376
[SPEAKER_31]: And is that OK?

1488
02:17:22,178 --> 02:17:23,559
[SPEAKER_20]: My understanding is that we're still seven.

1489
02:17:24,459 --> 02:17:25,340
[SPEAKER_31]: We are still seven.

1490
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:33,904
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's a seven member, generally speaking in the zoning context, the boards are whatever their full membership are, right?

1491
02:17:34,644 --> 02:17:35,445
[SPEAKER_31]: Ah, okay.

1492
02:17:39,447 --> 02:17:51,033
[SPEAKER_20]: And just to clarify for the board, you know, I think we all have, we all have our conscience and we all have

1493
02:17:52,508 --> 02:17:58,509
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, you know, what we, what we wish we could do.

1494
02:17:58,529 --> 02:18:17,994
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, but in order for this to be a valid decision by the board that respects the public, that respects the applicant, we do have to have a legal justification for the denial.

1495
02:18:24,558 --> 02:18:25,979
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'll let that sit for a second.

1496
02:18:36,922 --> 02:18:44,785
[SPEAKER_22]: And Emily, I can say as well, if you do choose to continue, we'll obviously take another look at the quantum issue and we can verify it.

1497
02:18:44,945 --> 02:18:49,026
[SPEAKER_22]: But as I'm just reading your ordinance today, my opinion would be a need for.

1498
02:18:49,426 --> 02:18:53,668
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm happy if you're going to continue to take another look at the quantum issue.

1499
02:18:57,713 --> 02:19:01,096
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1500
02:19:16,812 --> 02:19:20,996
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so I'm going to put forth a motion to continue

1501
02:19:27,490 --> 02:19:31,432
[SPEAKER_20]: uh, 401 Boston Ave, uh, to a date certain.

1502
02:19:34,053 --> 02:19:38,215
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks like that will be, I know we have a meeting next week on the 22nd.

1503
02:19:38,275 --> 02:19:44,618
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam chair, that is a special meeting just for the zoning.

1504
02:19:44,738 --> 02:19:46,319
[SPEAKER_32]: We weren't going to add it to that.

1505
02:19:46,419 --> 02:19:46,679
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1506
02:19:47,279 --> 02:19:54,563
[SPEAKER_20]: So then the next meeting would be the 5th of February would be.

1507
02:19:56,905 --> 02:19:58,125
[SPEAKER_20]: We meet in the first and the third.

1508
02:19:58,145 --> 02:20:01,106
[SPEAKER_31]: The fifth, right?

1509
02:20:01,606 --> 02:20:05,627
[SPEAKER_31]: The next one is the fifth, right, Danielle?

1510
02:20:05,728 --> 02:20:06,128
[SPEAKER_32]: Let me check.

1511
02:20:06,168 --> 02:20:11,929
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam Chair, can we pull the board for expected attendance at that meeting?

1512
02:20:13,570 --> 02:20:21,232
[SPEAKER_32]: Understanding that we never have full attendance because we're people with lives, things happen, and people take vacations.

1513
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:27,312
[SPEAKER_32]: I just don't want to count on just running into the same issue.

1514
02:20:28,153 --> 02:20:31,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1515
02:20:31,154 --> 02:20:33,896
[SPEAKER_20]: So, Ari, expected attendance?

1516
02:20:34,956 --> 02:20:39,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Starring unexpected circumstances, I am planning to attend.

1517
02:20:39,959 --> 02:20:40,619
[SPEAKER_21]: I will be there.

1518
02:20:40,639 --> 02:20:41,520
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie?

1519
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:43,561
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I will attend.

1520
02:20:44,061 --> 02:20:44,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Ben?

1521
02:20:45,702 --> 02:20:46,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Planning to be there.

1522
02:20:46,922 --> 02:20:47,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Sabrina?

1523
02:20:48,363 --> 02:20:50,284
[SPEAKER_17]: This is February 5th, correct?

1524
02:20:51,065 --> 02:20:51,285
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1525
02:20:52,238 --> 02:20:52,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I will be there.

1526
02:20:53,639 --> 02:20:53,919
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1527
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:56,981
[SPEAKER_20]: And do we know from Adam yet?

1528
02:21:02,304 --> 02:21:13,311
[SPEAKER_32]: I can check and see what his status is with the Outlook invitation.

1529
02:21:13,331 --> 02:21:17,654
[SPEAKER_32]: If somebody gets there quicker than me, what was his response?

1530
02:21:17,954 --> 02:21:19,155
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I'm going into it too.

1531
02:21:30,806 --> 02:21:33,728
[SPEAKER_20]: You and I are the only people going, Danielle.

1532
02:21:35,149 --> 02:21:37,190
[SPEAKER_32]: Folks, please respond to these and let me know.

1533
02:21:37,271 --> 02:21:37,431
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

1534
02:21:53,413 --> 02:21:56,235
[SPEAKER_32]: If Sabrina's accepted it, you have accepted it.

1535
02:21:57,075 --> 02:21:58,376
[SPEAKER_31]: Have you sent it?

1536
02:21:58,396 --> 02:21:59,257
[SPEAKER_31]: I haven't seen it.

1537
02:21:59,317 --> 02:22:06,982
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I sent them all out at the end of last year for at least the next six months.

1538
02:22:07,902 --> 02:22:11,464
[SPEAKER_32]: I can resend it if I can figure out how to do that.

1539
02:22:12,385 --> 02:22:15,767
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's no reason to believe that he would accept it in the next five minutes, though.

1540
02:22:16,247 --> 02:22:16,407
[SPEAKER_32]: No.

1541
02:22:16,928 --> 02:22:17,848
[SPEAKER_32]: That's not possible.

1542
02:22:18,068 --> 02:22:18,429
[SPEAKER_32]: No, no, no.

1543
02:22:18,449 --> 02:22:20,190
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, Annie, because Annie hadn't

1544
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:29,744
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we'll deal with everything, but administrative or technical things related to the calendar at another time.

1545
02:22:29,864 --> 02:22:35,267
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you're if you anticipate you can attend, then we'll take that as as the response.

1546
02:22:36,247 --> 02:22:38,328
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, I can see my answers.

1547
02:22:38,388 --> 02:22:41,510
[SPEAKER_32]: I do not have anything for Ben for Adam.

1548
02:22:42,310 --> 02:22:46,813
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so we don't know if he'll be here in which case we'll be in the same situation.

1549
02:22:46,833 --> 02:22:48,934
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so then.

1550
02:22:49,837 --> 02:22:52,079
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to pose a question to the applicant one last time.

1551
02:22:54,701 --> 02:23:02,527
[SPEAKER_20]: Knowing what you've, or hearing what you've heard about attendance, what's your preference?

1552
02:23:04,908 --> 02:23:06,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Chair, we would still prefer to continue.

1553
02:23:09,131 --> 02:23:11,693
[SPEAKER_20]: Continue is my gut next step.

1554
02:23:17,127 --> 02:23:22,709
[SPEAKER_20]: So what I'm going to do here is look for a motion to continue to a date certain, which is February 5th.

1555
02:23:24,229 --> 02:23:27,070
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm looking for a second on the motion to continue.

1556
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:32,292
[SPEAKER_31]: I'll second to continue to February 5th, Wednesday.

1557
02:23:32,672 --> 02:23:33,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Annie.

1558
02:23:35,213 --> 02:23:35,393
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

1559
02:23:35,413 --> 02:23:37,914
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going to do a roll call vote.

1560
02:23:38,574 --> 02:23:39,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari Fishman?

1561
02:23:41,515 --> 02:23:41,635
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1562
02:23:42,576 --> 02:23:43,996
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie String?

1563
02:23:44,016 --> 02:23:44,076
[SPEAKER_31]: Aye.

1564
02:23:45,377 --> 02:23:45,937
[SPEAKER_20]: Ben LaValle?

1565
02:23:49,417 --> 02:23:49,517
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1566
02:23:50,358 --> 02:23:51,259
[SPEAKER_20]: Sabrina Alpino.

1567
02:23:52,180 --> 02:23:52,300
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1568
02:23:53,521 --> 02:23:55,964
[SPEAKER_20]: And myself, Emily Hedeman, is also an aye.

1569
02:23:57,745 --> 02:24:03,931
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that, we are continuing 401 Boston Ave.

1570
02:24:04,212 --> 02:24:12,399
[SPEAKER_20]: The public hearing had closed, so this is just board deliberations at the next meeting.

1571
02:24:13,318 --> 02:24:16,479
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wanna thank the applicant for their patience.

1572
02:24:17,059 --> 02:24:21,261
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanna thank the public for their patience and their advocacy.

1573
02:24:21,281 --> 02:24:24,662
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanna thank city staff, my fellow board members.

1574
02:24:27,683 --> 02:24:28,704
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, thank you.

1575
02:24:30,024 --> 02:24:30,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1576
02:24:31,245 --> 02:24:32,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1577
02:24:36,126 --> 02:24:40,148
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that, I'm gonna propose a quick five minute bio break.

1578
02:24:42,065 --> 02:24:51,332
[SPEAKER_20]: So let's meet back here at, I'll say 8.03, give everybody an extra minute.

1579
02:24:51,352 --> 02:24:51,332
9.03, 9.03.

1580
02:24:52,473 --> 02:24:56,456
[SPEAKER_20]: And we will be hearing.

1581
02:24:56,476 --> 02:25:01,780
[SPEAKER_15]: The applicant for the ANR is here?

1582
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:02,420
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1583
02:25:03,862 --> 02:25:04,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1584
02:25:04,842 --> 02:25:06,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, that will be our next item.

1585
02:25:07,364 --> 02:25:07,724
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1586
02:25:08,185 --> 02:25:08,405
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1587
02:25:09,085 --> 02:25:10,927
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you to the applicant for their patience.

1588
02:25:14,973 --> 02:25:20,676
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, we are coming back from a brief break.

1589
02:25:23,997 --> 02:25:31,581
[SPEAKER_20]: We are hearing our third agenda item, which is A&R plan endorsement for 31 Wilson Street.

1590
02:25:33,562 --> 02:25:37,464
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to invite the proponent to present their proposal.

1591
02:25:37,564 --> 02:25:46,069
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would also like to thank the proponent for their patience and support as we adjusted the agenda this evening.

1592
02:25:47,390 --> 02:25:49,511
[SPEAKER_20]: I see Greg Maynard has their hand raised.

1593
02:25:50,512 --> 02:25:52,013
[SPEAKER_20]: Greg, are you able to unmute yourself?

1594
02:25:53,514 --> 02:25:54,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me?

1595
02:25:54,634 --> 02:25:55,275
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I can.

1596
02:25:55,315 --> 02:25:55,615
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1597
02:25:55,735 --> 02:25:56,976
[SPEAKER_20]: And thanks again for your patience.

1598
02:25:57,016 --> 02:25:57,916
[SPEAKER_20]: I really appreciate it.

1599
02:25:58,837 --> 02:25:58,957
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

1600
02:26:01,385 --> 02:26:04,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to talk us through the project?

1601
02:26:05,788 --> 02:26:06,289
[SPEAKER_19]: What'd you say?

1602
02:26:07,290 --> 02:26:11,193
[SPEAKER_09]: It took me a little while to figure out how the hand raise thing worked.

1603
02:26:11,573 --> 02:26:12,133
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I missed.

1604
02:26:12,153 --> 02:26:13,734
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't make these things easy, do they?

1605
02:26:14,555 --> 02:26:17,678
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was raising my hand like this, not on the emoji.

1606
02:26:18,638 --> 02:26:18,938
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1607
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:22,641
[SPEAKER_20]: Would you like to walk us through the project?

1608
02:26:23,782 --> 02:26:29,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's just a three lot, so that we're looking to

1609
02:26:30,768 --> 02:26:33,009
[SPEAKER_09]: move the lot line and make it a two lot possible.

1610
02:26:34,829 --> 02:26:35,109
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1611
02:26:38,930 --> 02:26:44,852
[SPEAKER_20]: Are there any comments from city staff related to the ANR for 31 Wilson?

1612
02:26:47,672 --> 02:26:53,454
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam Chair, I am looking for my

1613
02:26:55,625 --> 02:26:57,446
[SPEAKER_32]: I guess I think I closed that tab.

1614
02:26:57,466 --> 02:27:07,332
[SPEAKER_32]: But basically, yeah, it's easier if you can see what I'm talking about.

1615
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:07,612
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure.

1616
02:27:07,672 --> 02:27:11,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Just bear with me while Danielle opens that.

1617
02:27:11,514 --> 02:27:13,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Have all the members of the board done an A&R before?

1618
02:27:13,956 --> 02:27:15,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they aware of what that means?

1619
02:27:16,477 --> 02:27:19,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Should I, like, do you need that background while Danielle finds it?

1620
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:24,522
[SPEAKER_20]: Any members of the board want an intro from

1621
02:27:26,015 --> 02:27:26,476
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia.

1622
02:27:26,496 --> 02:27:29,778
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the best one you're going to get if you're going to get one.

1623
02:27:34,261 --> 02:27:41,766
[SPEAKER_32]: OK, I can say, well, basically, it's City of Medford opted into subdivision control law.

1624
02:27:42,186 --> 02:27:50,332
[SPEAKER_32]: And there is a aspect of it that is approval not required, commonly called A&R.

1625
02:27:50,372 --> 02:27:53,534
[SPEAKER_32]: So basically, if the lots meet the minimum frontage,

1626
02:27:56,091 --> 02:28:11,966
[SPEAKER_32]: for that zoning district are located on a right of way and have adequate, reasonable and adequate access, then the board is obligated to endorse the plan as approval not required.

1627
02:28:11,986 --> 02:28:17,471
[SPEAKER_32]: It's really a procedural kind of rubber stamping thing.

1628
02:28:19,493 --> 02:28:20,995
[SPEAKER_32]: In cities and towns that have not

1629
02:28:22,143 --> 02:28:27,946
[SPEAKER_32]: have opted out of subdivision control law, like our neighbors, Somerville and Watertown, other communities I worked in.

1630
02:28:28,467 --> 02:28:29,407
[SPEAKER_32]: These are not a thing.

1631
02:28:29,887 --> 02:28:31,548
[SPEAKER_32]: The planning director just signs it.

1632
02:28:34,090 --> 02:28:35,631
[SPEAKER_32]: Let me share.

1633
02:28:35,651 --> 02:28:38,212
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm terrible at this.

1634
02:28:39,753 --> 02:28:41,013
[SPEAKER_32]: I think... Not alone, Greg.

1635
02:28:41,274 --> 02:28:42,334
[SPEAKER_32]: We're all struggling.

1636
02:28:42,494 --> 02:28:42,774
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

1637
02:28:43,155 --> 02:28:44,575
[SPEAKER_32]: Application window.

1638
02:28:44,716 --> 02:28:45,016
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

1639
02:28:45,276 --> 02:28:45,776
[SPEAKER_32]: Windows.

1640
02:28:46,817 --> 02:28:47,177
[SPEAKER_32]: Hold on.

1641
02:28:48,318 --> 02:28:48,598
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

1642
02:28:49,378 --> 02:28:50,439
[SPEAKER_32]: This is the existing

1643
02:28:52,098 --> 02:28:58,852
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, the existing 3 lots, they're undersized, but they do meet minimum frontage.

1644
02:28:59,032 --> 02:29:00,155
[SPEAKER_32]: This is the existing situation and.

1645
02:29:03,982 --> 02:29:20,351
[SPEAKER_32]: What they are looking to do is to delete one of the lot lines and move one of the lot lines to create two conforming buildable lots that would meet the minimum frontage, which is 35 in the SF2.

1646
02:29:20,371 --> 02:29:25,754
[SPEAKER_32]: It fronts on Wilson Street, which is a public way, not even a private way.

1647
02:29:29,804 --> 02:29:40,750
[SPEAKER_32]: My opinion is that there is adequate access for these two parcels.

1648
02:29:41,811 --> 02:29:43,552
[SPEAKER_32]: How do I switch what I'm sharing?

1649
02:29:43,672 --> 02:29:44,412
[SPEAKER_32]: Can you see that now?

1650
02:29:44,913 --> 02:29:45,173
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1651
02:29:45,933 --> 02:29:47,374
[SPEAKER_32]: So this is what they're looking to do.

1652
02:29:47,414 --> 02:29:48,935
[SPEAKER_32]: As you see now, there's two lots.

1653
02:29:50,016 --> 02:29:56,779
[SPEAKER_32]: They're conforming with lot size, which is 5,000, which, as you know, endorsing an A&R doesn't

1654
02:29:59,860 --> 02:30:05,102
[SPEAKER_32]: doesn't even make any promises that it is buildable, but these actually are.

1655
02:30:05,563 --> 02:30:10,825
[SPEAKER_32]: So he's creating two conforming lots where there's three non-conforming lots right now.

1656
02:30:13,807 --> 02:30:29,254
[SPEAKER_32]: So I would recommend that you endorse the plan as submitted, and then authorize Alicia Hano, Director, to sign off on this on the MILR for the applicant to pick up.

1657
02:30:31,397 --> 02:30:34,658
[SPEAKER_32]: when he at his convenience.

1658
02:30:36,018 --> 02:30:42,620
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so just to recap, the questions we need to validate are, do the lots front on a right of way?

1659
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:46,501
[SPEAKER_20]: Do the lots satisfy the minimum frontage requirements?

1660
02:30:47,281 --> 02:30:50,182
[SPEAKER_20]: And is access to the lots provided?

1661
02:30:54,683 --> 02:30:59,184
[SPEAKER_20]: Does anybody have any questions in terms of the division of those lots?

1662
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:04,401
[SPEAKER_20]: Wilson Street as a public way.

1663
02:31:05,621 --> 02:31:10,703
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter Calves has rejoined us, our resident transportation expert.

1664
02:31:12,424 --> 02:31:13,304
[SPEAKER_20]: We got him for that.

1665
02:31:15,966 --> 02:31:19,587
[SPEAKER_20]: Any questions from the board for Mr. Maynard?

1666
02:31:25,389 --> 02:31:28,971
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to clarify, thinking about the access,

1667
02:31:31,134 --> 02:31:36,598
[SPEAKER_20]: Whether the proposed building lots have practical access typically focus on the following two issues.

1668
02:31:37,599 --> 02:31:40,722
[SPEAKER_20]: Adequacy of the way on which the proposed lots front.

1669
02:31:41,582 --> 02:31:50,709
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's Wilson Street public way maintained by the city, as well as the adequacy of the access from the way to the buildable portion of the lot.

1670
02:31:51,790 --> 02:32:00,617
[SPEAKER_20]: And from what we're seeing from the site plans, as well as the existing structure, there appears to be no issues with creating access via new curb cut.

1671
02:32:06,853 --> 02:32:10,094
[SPEAKER_20]: Any questions or other discussion from the board?

1672
02:32:10,114 --> 02:32:15,056
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, I think it looks good.

1673
02:32:15,196 --> 02:32:17,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it satisfies the conditions as I see them.

1674
02:32:19,617 --> 02:32:20,138
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Peter.

1675
02:32:21,198 --> 02:32:22,158
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see any issues.

1676
02:32:22,658 --> 02:32:25,720
[SPEAKER_21]: Happy to vote to move ahead unless anyone else has them.

1677
02:32:25,740 --> 02:32:27,260
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree.

1678
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:27,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1679
02:32:31,558 --> 02:32:37,683
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so if we find the criteria is met, I'm looking for a motion to endorse the plan as approval not required.

1680
02:32:37,903 --> 02:32:38,744
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the ANR.

1681
02:32:39,244 --> 02:32:44,008
[SPEAKER_20]: And then also authorizing Alicia to endorse the plans.

1682
02:32:45,229 --> 02:32:46,229
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm looking for a motion.

1683
02:32:48,251 --> 02:32:48,651
[SPEAKER_10]: So moved.

1684
02:32:49,832 --> 02:32:50,413
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Peter.

1685
02:32:50,453 --> 02:32:51,233
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I have a second?

1686
02:32:54,676 --> 02:32:55,056
[SPEAKER_20]: Second.

1687
02:32:56,097 --> 02:32:56,757
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Ari.

1688
02:32:57,318 --> 02:32:58,599
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll do a roll call vote.

1689
02:33:00,828 --> 02:33:01,468
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter Calves.

1690
02:33:03,329 --> 02:33:03,449
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1691
02:33:04,689 --> 02:33:05,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari Fishman.

1692
02:33:06,190 --> 02:33:06,310
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1693
02:33:07,230 --> 02:33:08,051
[SPEAKER_20]: Sabrina Alpino.

1694
02:33:09,031 --> 02:33:09,171
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1695
02:33:11,372 --> 02:33:11,932
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie Strang.

1696
02:33:12,832 --> 02:33:12,972
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1697
02:33:14,053 --> 02:33:14,673
[SPEAKER_20]: Ben LaValle.

1698
02:33:14,693 --> 02:33:16,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1699
02:33:17,034 --> 02:33:19,475
[SPEAKER_20]: And myself, Emily Hedeman, is an aye.

1700
02:33:21,555 --> 02:33:22,956
[SPEAKER_20]: So the motion passes.

1701
02:33:24,036 --> 02:33:29,298
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, I think that's it.

1702
02:33:30,527 --> 02:33:39,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much, Mr. Maynard for coming before the development board, and we wish you the best of luck with your plans moving forward.

1703
02:33:39,994 --> 02:33:41,595
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1704
02:33:42,736 --> 02:33:43,096
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1705
02:33:49,340 --> 02:33:53,143
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this point, we are moving forward in the agenda.

1706
02:33:55,504 --> 02:33:56,265
[SPEAKER_20]: We are at 21 St.

1707
02:33:56,345 --> 02:33:56,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Clair Road.

1708
02:33:59,516 --> 02:34:02,177
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a site plan review for a Dover amendment use.

1709
02:34:02,857 --> 02:34:04,937
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a continued public hearing.

1710
02:34:08,618 --> 02:34:14,739
[SPEAKER_20]: Similar to the previous continued public hearing, we are looking for the applicant to present any new information.

1711
02:34:17,279 --> 02:34:25,961
[SPEAKER_20]: If there is a member of the applicant's team that would like to speak, see Attorney Ross, Mr. Litchfield, Tisha Gouchard,

1712
02:34:29,725 --> 02:34:30,686
[SPEAKER_40]: Hello, Madam Chair.

1713
02:34:31,386 --> 02:34:31,646
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

1714
02:34:32,147 --> 02:34:32,527
[SPEAKER_40]: Hi.

1715
02:34:32,547 --> 02:34:33,428
[SPEAKER_40]: Hello, everyone.

1716
02:34:33,668 --> 02:34:34,389
[SPEAKER_40]: Good to see you again.

1717
02:34:35,610 --> 02:34:40,914
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes, I do have just a couple of paragraphs to share with you.

1718
02:34:41,634 --> 02:34:44,677
[SPEAKER_40]: No actual presentation, if that's okay.

1719
02:34:45,497 --> 02:34:46,538
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep, that sounds great.

1720
02:34:46,598 --> 02:34:49,500
[SPEAKER_40]: Just kind of the net new and a summary, a basic summary.

1721
02:34:50,360 --> 02:34:52,301
[SPEAKER_40]: So, you know, again, my name is Mike Ross.

1722
02:34:52,381 --> 02:35:06,730
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm the attorney for the co-applicants, Assisi Holdings LLC, represented here by Andrew Litchfield, and Halo House Inc., represented here by Taisha Gishard.

1723
02:35:07,911 --> 02:35:12,174
[SPEAKER_40]: For the proposal to cite a domestic violence shelter for women and children,

1724
02:35:13,254 --> 02:35:17,358
[SPEAKER_40]: with educational programs and services at 21 St Clair Road.

1725
02:35:17,998 --> 02:35:30,089
[SPEAKER_40]: The relief we're seeking is site plan review approval for Dover amended uses pursuant to section 94-11.8 of the Medford zoning ordinance.

1726
02:35:30,769 --> 02:35:38,997
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the third time we are before the Community Development Board not including individual meetings with the City of Medford staff

1727
02:35:39,847 --> 02:35:47,512
[SPEAKER_40]: and leadership appearing before this board on November 6th, December 18th, and now tonight, January 15th.

1728
02:35:48,312 --> 02:35:59,940
[SPEAKER_40]: I think it's fair to say that at each step in this process, this proposal has become a better one, both for the co-applicants, but also for the community generally.

1729
02:36:00,680 --> 02:36:07,885
[SPEAKER_40]: Many of the changes to the project came directly from comments that we heard at these hearings, either by the board

1730
02:36:08,636 --> 02:36:09,996
[SPEAKER_40]: or by members of the public.

1731
02:36:10,857 --> 02:36:22,799
[SPEAKER_40]: That first tranche of changes had more to do with the physical building itself, such as we created a redundant accessible access point with the addition of a side ramp.

1732
02:36:24,700 --> 02:36:33,502
[SPEAKER_40]: In addition to the previously proposed lift on the front of the entrance for accessible access to the building, we ensured that

1733
02:36:34,562 --> 02:36:40,684
[SPEAKER_40]: There was additional play space created for children both inside the building and outside the building.

1734
02:36:42,105 --> 02:36:52,728
[SPEAKER_40]: We reduced the number of dedicated residential rooms from 37 to 34 while increasing classroom space and bathroom areas.

1735
02:36:54,309 --> 02:37:00,311
[SPEAKER_40]: Additional changes were also made to the programming and other amendments to the application itself.

1736
02:37:01,393 --> 02:37:27,505
[SPEAKER_40]: refining the description of the Halo House so that it was specific to that of a domestic violence facility use, as opposed to the broader use of homeless shelter, providing expanded curriculum information and requiring mandatory participation for all adult residents, and committing to a shuttle service that will allow residents and staff safe access to area amenities and public transportation.

1737
02:37:28,752 --> 02:37:32,534
[SPEAKER_40]: The applicants have continued to respond to issues as they have arisen.

1738
02:37:32,975 --> 02:37:49,265
[SPEAKER_40]: Specifically ahead of tonight's meeting, we have provided a copy of a signed lease agreement between the building owner and the nonprofit tenant, which is a provision that the Dover Amendment expressly calls for in the statute.

1739
02:37:50,397 --> 02:38:00,405
[SPEAKER_40]: And as you can see from the lease, the initial term is for five years with a five-year extension, along for a total rental period of 10 years.

1740
02:38:02,487 --> 02:38:10,233
[SPEAKER_40]: On behalf of the co-applicants, I'd like to thank the board and the staff for your patience and your assistance throughout this process.

1741
02:38:10,313 --> 02:38:13,335
[SPEAKER_40]: And I'm just gonna pause there, Madam Chair, to see if there are any questions.

1742
02:38:14,556 --> 02:38:15,537
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, thank you, Attorney Ross.

1743
02:38:17,121 --> 02:38:37,386
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this time, I would like to ask the City's Attorney, Attorney Stein, to share some insight with us related to the applicability of the Dover Amendment, as well as any specifics around the relief requested.

1744
02:38:40,235 --> 02:38:49,452
[SPEAKER_22]: So, obviously, for anyone that was here for the prior application, you've already essentially heard me share the summary, but I think it's good to do it for each application for any new people that have.

1745
02:38:50,473 --> 02:38:51,575
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, joined.

1746
02:38:52,579 --> 02:39:08,352
[SPEAKER_22]: the meeting, General Law Chapter 48, Section 3, parts of which we call the Dover Amendment, protects the use of land for bona fide educational use when that land is owned or leased by an educational nonprofit.

1747
02:39:08,713 --> 02:39:14,998
[SPEAKER_22]: And so the same standard that we discussed earlier, is there a bona fide educational use happening on this property?

1748
02:39:15,698 --> 02:39:19,542
[SPEAKER_22]: Is the operator of that use, either the owner or the lessee, and are they a nonprofit?

1749
02:39:20,142 --> 02:39:21,442
[SPEAKER_22]: with an educational purpose.

1750
02:39:23,663 --> 02:39:30,585
[SPEAKER_22]: The zoning ordinance in the section 9411 I believe has again the Dover site plan review.

1751
02:39:31,926 --> 02:39:37,227
[SPEAKER_22]: If you have been here all night then you just heard us have a lengthy discussion about the quantum of vote.

1752
02:39:37,607 --> 02:39:41,709
[SPEAKER_22]: I've opined I think that it is a four of seven vote.

1753
02:39:42,349 --> 02:39:44,569
[SPEAKER_22]: This board is constituted for seven members.

1754
02:39:45,310 --> 02:39:49,891
[SPEAKER_22]: It's pretty consistent in the land use realm that we look at the total seats on the

1755
02:39:49,891 --> 02:39:51,452
[SPEAKER_22]: the board when determining a majority.

1756
02:39:51,472 --> 02:39:59,218
[SPEAKER_22]: And so while that is something I had indicated previously, we can re-verify before you re-vote on the prior application.

1757
02:39:59,999 --> 02:40:04,022
[SPEAKER_22]: That's my opinion of the need tonight would be four of the five people that are.

1758
02:40:04,730 --> 02:40:07,471
[SPEAKER_22]: here would be needed to approve this application.

1759
02:40:07,491 --> 02:40:18,434
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm happy to answer any particular questions that anyone has, but I do think that the ordinance is pretty straightforward when you look at section 94-11.8.3 on the scope of the site plan review.

1760
02:40:18,474 --> 02:40:20,155
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, the board is charged with determining

1761
02:40:23,796 --> 02:40:34,820
[SPEAKER_22]: if the use is over, if it's that bona fide educational use, and the reasonable regulations that will apply to the extent that full compliance isn't possible or being asked for.

1762
02:40:36,460 --> 02:40:38,461
[SPEAKER_22]: So happy to answer any other questions.

1763
02:40:39,301 --> 02:40:41,622
[SPEAKER_22]: Certainly don't want to add to the time of the night.

1764
02:40:41,682 --> 02:40:42,362
[SPEAKER_22]: We'd like something.

1765
02:40:43,723 --> 02:40:44,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Attorney's time.

1766
02:40:44,643 --> 02:40:45,484
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.

1767
02:40:45,804 --> 02:40:47,124
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle, I see your hand.

1768
02:40:48,765 --> 02:40:51,866
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, Madam Chair, I just wanted to- Your audio is a little low.

1769
02:40:53,070 --> 02:40:54,671
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry.

1770
02:40:56,113 --> 02:40:57,314
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to clarify that.

1771
02:40:57,834 --> 02:40:59,215
[SPEAKER_20]: It's still very low.

1772
02:41:02,998 --> 02:41:03,599
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

1773
02:41:07,122 --> 02:41:07,842
[SPEAKER_32]: New computer.

1774
02:41:09,023 --> 02:41:09,724
[SPEAKER_32]: That's a little better.

1775
02:41:10,805 --> 02:41:15,649
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to say that we have Peter Keltz, who is with us tonight, so we have six.

1776
02:41:16,209 --> 02:41:19,372
[SPEAKER_32]: He was just recused for the Tough Smarter.

1777
02:41:19,472 --> 02:41:20,653
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for clarifying that.

1778
02:41:21,886 --> 02:41:23,427
[SPEAKER_32]: So, it still is because it's for.

1779
02:41:25,609 --> 02:41:31,054
[SPEAKER_32]: So, if this this vote would prevail with a 4 to 2 or.

1780
02:41:31,075 --> 02:41:39,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, just for in the affirmative, either it's in my mind, it's a 7 member board and the file just calls for a majority.

1781
02:41:39,442 --> 02:41:40,844
[SPEAKER_22]: So, 4 is a majority.

1782
02:41:40,864 --> 02:41:40,964
[SPEAKER_22]: So.

1783
02:41:42,922 --> 02:41:48,505
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's no reason for anybody to vote affirmative or negative.

1784
02:41:49,005 --> 02:41:50,326
[SPEAKER_20]: We're just talking logistics here.

1785
02:41:50,406 --> 02:41:55,549
[SPEAKER_20]: So we just want to be up front with the process so that everyone is clear.

1786
02:41:57,630 --> 02:41:57,950
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm sure.

1787
02:41:59,743 --> 02:42:00,503
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, Attorney Ross.

1788
02:42:01,123 --> 02:42:04,825
[SPEAKER_40]: I just have to be compelled to respond to that last statement.

1789
02:42:05,805 --> 02:42:18,989
[SPEAKER_40]: It may not be an issue, but I'm virtually certain that the number of votes that you'll need for passing a matter tonight would be three, not four.

1790
02:42:19,849 --> 02:42:23,630
[SPEAKER_40]: And we can go into that later if it becomes an issue.

1791
02:42:23,770 --> 02:42:28,412
[SPEAKER_40]: But I didn't want to stay silent because silence might

1792
02:42:29,750 --> 02:42:33,371
[SPEAKER_40]: appear as if I'm agreeing with what was just said previously.

1793
02:42:34,811 --> 02:42:34,991
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

1794
02:42:35,892 --> 02:42:38,672
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for adding that perspective.

1795
02:42:40,713 --> 02:42:45,494
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this point, I'd like to open it up to the board for questions and comments.

1796
02:42:46,774 --> 02:42:56,417
[SPEAKER_20]: What I'm hearing is that the significant new information is related to the lease between Halo House and Assisi Holdings.

1797
02:42:57,882 --> 02:43:04,163
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm curious if the board has any questions, comments.

1798
02:43:11,765 --> 02:43:12,025
[SPEAKER_18]: Ben?

1799
02:43:14,166 --> 02:43:19,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we going to go through the conditions or is now the time to open up the conversation?

1800
02:43:19,767 --> 02:43:22,207
[SPEAKER_20]: We still have to open the public hearing.

1801
02:43:23,127 --> 02:43:25,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so I'll- The public comment, excuse me.

1802
02:43:26,308 --> 02:43:28,650
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we'll close the public comment period.

1803
02:43:28,970 --> 02:43:33,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Then we'll have time to rediscuss as a board.

1804
02:43:33,053 --> 02:43:37,936
[SPEAKER_20]: And then that's typically the time that we speak to conditions.

1805
02:43:37,976 --> 02:43:41,758
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you have some insight, I would say there's time.

1806
02:43:42,259 --> 02:43:43,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'll be super brief.

1807
02:43:44,060 --> 02:43:49,944
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to have some dialogue around parking.

1808
02:43:50,144 --> 02:43:53,346
[SPEAKER_13]: I see the condition around no city of Medford.

1809
02:43:55,680 --> 02:44:02,206
[SPEAKER_13]: resident parking and just sort of hear if the applicant has any statements around that.

1810
02:44:03,207 --> 02:44:05,068
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a major concern that I have.

1811
02:44:05,729 --> 02:44:06,129
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1812
02:44:07,170 --> 02:44:07,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Peter?

1813
02:44:07,510 --> 02:44:20,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, I'll be very brief just trying to kind of publicly air what I remember to be the

1814
02:44:22,627 --> 02:44:27,290
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of collected thoughts around this project when we last left it off.

1815
02:44:27,390 --> 02:44:35,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe our last concerns were about the Dover, to confirm the Dover amendment applicability, and that was kind of the last major sticking point.

1816
02:44:36,035 --> 02:44:44,239
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to confirm that that was where we had stood as of our last hearing, and I will reserve any further comments left to the public hearing.

1817
02:44:48,962 --> 02:44:50,763
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's my recollection as well.

1818
02:44:54,767 --> 02:45:06,353
[SPEAKER_20]: So if there are no other pre-comment, pre-public comment remarks from the board, I will

1819
02:45:08,298 --> 02:45:10,299
[SPEAKER_20]: I will now open the public comment period.

1820
02:45:11,100 --> 02:45:14,142
[SPEAKER_20]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand function.

1821
02:45:15,243 --> 02:45:18,865
[SPEAKER_20]: You're also welcome to message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.

1822
02:45:19,766 --> 02:45:25,089
[SPEAKER_20]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

1823
02:45:26,130 --> 02:45:29,512
[SPEAKER_20]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

1824
02:45:30,092 --> 02:45:31,313
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a legal requirement.

1825
02:45:31,754 --> 02:45:33,174
[SPEAKER_20]: We may remind you if you forget.

1826
02:45:34,115 --> 02:45:45,964
[SPEAKER_20]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members as that's not part of the public record and we need to abide by open meeting laws.

1827
02:45:46,925 --> 02:45:54,651
[SPEAKER_20]: However, if you do have technical issues, audio, raising hand, and so on, please message staff for assistance.

1828
02:45:54,771 --> 02:45:56,993
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is Danielle Evans and Alicia Hunt.

1829
02:45:58,374 --> 02:46:00,175
[SPEAKER_20]: Each participant will have two minutes to speak.

1830
02:46:00,876 --> 02:46:01,717
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a timer.

1831
02:46:03,172 --> 02:46:03,893
[SPEAKER_20]: up on screen.

1832
02:46:06,475 --> 02:46:09,498
[SPEAKER_20]: I see one member of the public in the queue.

1833
02:46:12,721 --> 02:46:18,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Racer and Alicia, are you able to do the timer?

1834
02:46:19,326 --> 02:46:20,007
[SPEAKER_20]: Awesome, thank you.

1835
02:46:21,563 --> 02:46:28,109
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, madam chair members of the board Harley racer with the law firm rich may 176 federal street in Boston.

1836
02:46:29,970 --> 02:46:31,772
[SPEAKER_35]: The lease changes nothing here.

1837
02:46:32,513 --> 02:46:34,154
[SPEAKER_35]: The threshold question.

1838
02:46:34,895 --> 02:46:37,177
[SPEAKER_35]: Is that is whether the applicant.

1839
02:46:37,817 --> 02:46:41,701
[SPEAKER_35]: is a non-profit educational institution, and it is not.

1840
02:46:41,821 --> 02:46:45,824
[SPEAKER_35]: The applicant is a for-profit developer, a CC LLC.

1841
02:46:46,205 --> 02:46:47,466
[SPEAKER_35]: They remain the applicant.

1842
02:46:47,726 --> 02:46:57,655
[SPEAKER_35]: They have now said that Halo House is a co-applicant, and even if that is permissible, it does not remove this out of the bar of the Dover Amendment.

1843
02:46:58,135 --> 02:46:59,576
[SPEAKER_35]: And they've cited no case

1844
02:47:00,437 --> 02:47:09,723
[SPEAKER_35]: no case whatsoever that allows a for-profit corporation to access the benefits and protections of the Dover Amendment for a for-profit use.

1845
02:47:09,803 --> 02:47:16,687
[SPEAKER_35]: When you get to the question of what is this proposed use of the applicant a CC, it's to develop the property and rent it for profit.

1846
02:47:17,087 --> 02:47:20,469
[SPEAKER_35]: This would be a non-precedented expansion of the Dover Amendment.

1847
02:47:20,509 --> 02:47:28,975
[SPEAKER_35]: And the only case that I found that deals with the for-profit aspect where a for-profit entity seeking the Dover Amendment protections rejects this.

1848
02:47:29,875 --> 02:47:35,161
[SPEAKER_35]: I cited it in a letter sent on January 8th at Sullivan v. Heritage Plantation of Sandwich.

1849
02:47:35,582 --> 02:47:42,749
[SPEAKER_35]: There, an LLC was applying for Dover Mement protections, and the majority member of that LLC was a for-profit corporation.

1850
02:47:42,809 --> 02:47:45,012
[SPEAKER_35]: The court said, this is not acceptable.

1851
02:47:45,272 --> 02:47:53,262
[SPEAKER_35]: And to allow this type of arrangement, just like what we have here, it would defeat the purpose of the statute and provide an easy end run around the nonprofit requirement.

1852
02:47:53,623 --> 02:47:57,187
[SPEAKER_35]: A CC is attempting an end run around the nonprofit requirement.

1853
02:47:57,487 --> 02:48:01,973
[SPEAKER_35]: They are the applicant and the lease is contingent on them getting this permit.

1854
02:48:01,993 --> 02:48:03,215
[SPEAKER_35]: So this kind of a circular

1855
02:48:04,456 --> 02:48:09,359
[SPEAKER_35]: problem that they have, and that the lease doesn't become effective unless they get this permit.

1856
02:48:09,379 --> 02:48:20,204
[SPEAKER_35]: They only get this permit by claiming the protections and benefits of the Dover Amendment as a for-profit corporation that's not permissible, and this would be reversed on appeal if the board goes forward with it.

1857
02:48:20,605 --> 02:48:20,985
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1858
02:48:22,566 --> 02:48:23,506
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Attorney Ray, sir.

1859
02:48:23,526 --> 02:48:25,067
[SPEAKER_20]: Appreciate your comment and your insight.

1860
02:48:29,269 --> 02:48:31,290
[SPEAKER_20]: The next hand I see is a bidet.

1861
02:48:34,180 --> 02:48:37,182
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you please state your name and address for the record, please?

1862
02:48:41,985 --> 02:48:43,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1863
02:48:43,385 --> 02:48:45,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Abida Bhanu.

1864
02:48:46,087 --> 02:48:48,128
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm hearing a little bit of an echo.

1865
02:48:48,148 --> 02:48:48,228
[SPEAKER_20]: Echo?

1866
02:48:49,949 --> 02:48:52,731
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, that sounds a little bit better.

1867
02:48:53,171 --> 02:48:53,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Better?

1868
02:48:53,671 --> 02:48:54,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you so much.

1869
02:48:54,972 --> 02:48:55,332
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1870
02:48:55,352 --> 02:48:56,213
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you rehear the timer?

1871
02:48:57,185 --> 02:48:58,546
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Abida Banu.

1872
02:48:59,046 --> 02:49:00,786
[SPEAKER_01]: My address is 11 St.

1873
02:49:00,866 --> 02:49:01,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Clair Road.

1874
02:49:02,387 --> 02:49:06,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm immediate next to 21st St.

1875
02:49:06,448 --> 02:49:06,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Clair.

1876
02:49:07,548 --> 02:49:12,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And since this project coming and talking people, we are very unhappy.

1877
02:49:13,530 --> 02:49:17,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm having mental health issue such as high level of anxiety.

1878
02:49:17,891 --> 02:49:23,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm struggling to manage my daily task because I work from home most of the time.

1879
02:49:24,333 --> 02:49:27,856
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will invade my privacy.

1880
02:49:28,957 --> 02:49:44,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been living in this location peacefully, and our community members do not want our neighborhood, we have a very bad traffic issues, as you know.

1881
02:49:45,330 --> 02:49:52,196
[SPEAKER_01]: So please try to understand, we are very peaceful community, we want to live together, okay?

1882
02:49:52,717 --> 02:49:53,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1883
02:49:54,303 --> 02:49:55,043
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Abita.

1884
02:49:58,966 --> 02:50:02,088
[SPEAKER_20]: Next for public comment, I see Emily Lazzaro.

1885
02:50:02,108 --> 02:50:11,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Emily Lazzaro, 170 Mystic Street Extension.

1886
02:50:12,075 --> 02:50:14,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for taking my comment.

1887
02:50:14,036 --> 02:50:18,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I spoke many weeks ago, the first time you took this issue up.

1888
02:50:19,980 --> 02:50:20,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I just

1889
02:50:23,122 --> 02:50:28,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Respectfully to Attorney Racer, this is squarely a Dover amendment use.

1890
02:50:31,907 --> 02:50:43,754
[SPEAKER_11]: The lessee is a non-profit organization and many homeless shelters with even less educational purposes have

1891
02:50:45,916 --> 02:50:49,899
[SPEAKER_11]: have qualified as such, and I think this is a really exciting project.

1892
02:50:50,219 --> 02:50:56,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think you would, this would be a great asset to Medford and to the wider community.

1893
02:50:56,645 --> 02:51:00,628
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate the time you've all spent.

1894
02:51:01,229 --> 02:51:01,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1895
02:51:03,791 --> 02:51:04,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Emily.

1896
02:51:06,273 --> 02:51:09,236
[SPEAKER_20]: The next public comment we have is iPad KR.

1897
02:51:17,182 --> 02:51:19,544
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, this is Kelly Rasa with 35 St.

1898
02:51:19,584 --> 02:51:20,365
[SPEAKER_41]: Francis Street.

1899
02:51:24,309 --> 02:51:25,850
[SPEAKER_25]: You just turn the volume down.

1900
02:51:29,734 --> 02:51:30,955
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we restart the timer?

1901
02:51:31,816 --> 02:51:32,116
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1902
02:51:32,819 --> 02:51:34,440
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, I'm sorry for the echo.

1903
02:51:34,480 --> 02:51:36,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's a little echoey.

1904
02:51:36,962 --> 02:51:37,642
[SPEAKER_41]: Is it better now?

1905
02:51:38,102 --> 02:51:39,143
[SPEAKER_20]: It's much better, thank you.

1906
02:51:39,223 --> 02:51:39,683
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, great.

1907
02:51:40,384 --> 02:51:45,867
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm going to send an email because I'm not going to have enough time to read what I'd like to read in the two minutes.

1908
02:51:46,228 --> 02:51:52,032
[SPEAKER_41]: So I'd like to ask, is the letter I delivered on December 18th actually part of the permanent record?

1909
02:51:52,072 --> 02:51:53,332
[SPEAKER_41]: I dropped it off at City Hall.

1910
02:51:53,833 --> 02:51:54,093
[SPEAKER_41]: It is.

1911
02:51:54,713 --> 02:51:59,196
[SPEAKER_41]: I was unable to view that in the documentation on the website.

1912
02:52:01,769 --> 02:52:07,293
[SPEAKER_41]: The applicant is proposing 40 rooms security, 40 rooms, security staff, et cetera.

1913
02:52:07,833 --> 02:52:13,778
[SPEAKER_41]: Obviously this much activity will necessitate its fair share of deliveries for goods and service as well.

1914
02:52:15,199 --> 02:52:17,100
[SPEAKER_41]: Now the site is currently unoccupied.

1915
02:52:17,140 --> 02:52:22,684
[SPEAKER_41]: There are no inhabitants, no users, no residents, no students, no one is currently occupying the site.

1916
02:52:23,204 --> 02:52:27,047
[SPEAKER_41]: And there is a question about whether this use can safely accommodate

1917
02:52:29,505 --> 02:52:32,487
[SPEAKER_41]: the, this use, I'm sorry, I just lost my spot.

1918
02:52:33,428 --> 02:52:38,452
[SPEAKER_41]: I challenge that this property can safely handle the use as proposed.

1919
02:52:38,992 --> 02:52:44,697
[SPEAKER_41]: Can the applicant please answer for the board and all the public truthfully the following question.

1920
02:52:46,238 --> 02:52:55,325
[SPEAKER_41]: Andrew, please share with us that when you arrived to visit the neighborhood, I believe it was January 3rd, to the unoccupied,

1921
02:52:56,829 --> 02:53:01,211
[SPEAKER_41]: building site, you drove up by car, where did you park?

1922
02:53:02,512 --> 02:53:11,896
[SPEAKER_41]: You parked directly in front of the building, in fact, in the fire lane, exactly where we as neighbors have concerns about.

1923
02:53:12,356 --> 02:53:14,377
[SPEAKER_41]: There is no parking with this building.

1924
02:53:14,998 --> 02:53:26,423
[SPEAKER_41]: And the applicant actually drove up to the building, pulled his car into the fire lane in front of his property, that's true, and stood at the edge of my driveway.

1925
02:53:29,782 --> 02:53:33,344
[SPEAKER_41]: We are not opposed to development of this building.

1926
02:53:33,744 --> 02:53:38,307
[SPEAKER_41]: We're opposed to the use under the guise of Dover.

1927
02:53:39,328 --> 02:53:43,971
[SPEAKER_41]: More directly, have you yourself ever parked in the marked fire lane or the church parking lot?

1928
02:53:44,231 --> 02:53:45,612
[SPEAKER_41]: Now I want to be honest with you.

1929
02:53:46,052 --> 02:53:49,695
[SPEAKER_41]: Before you answer, I have security camera pictures.

1930
02:53:52,370 --> 02:53:55,351
[SPEAKER_20]: Your time is up, Kelly, but I really appreciate your comments.

1931
02:53:56,031 --> 02:54:04,353
[SPEAKER_20]: And we do have your comment from the 18th available, but I would encourage you to also email any additional comments into the city.

1932
02:54:05,734 --> 02:54:06,094
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1933
02:54:09,995 --> 02:54:12,535
[SPEAKER_20]: The next public comment we have is from Cheryl.

1934
02:54:18,477 --> 02:54:19,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, can you hear me?

1935
02:54:20,201 --> 02:54:20,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I can.

1936
02:54:20,962 --> 02:54:21,583
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Cheryl.

1937
02:54:21,923 --> 02:54:24,045
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you please state your name and address for the record?

1938
02:54:24,065 --> 02:54:28,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez and I live at 281 Park Street in Medford.

1939
02:54:30,052 --> 02:54:32,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like this application is a for-profit entity.

1940
02:54:32,775 --> 02:54:40,984
[SPEAKER_07]: He's put a definite end date on this of 10 years, so he's planning to use this building for something else and he's looking to exploit a loophole here.

1941
02:54:41,605 --> 02:54:50,649
[SPEAKER_07]: The city councilor who just spoke said this was a homeless shelter, but the applicant says that it's a domestic violence shelter, and Emily Lazzaro met with the applicant.

1942
02:54:50,709 --> 02:54:58,173
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is part of the confusion for the area, is that it keeps changing and fluctuating depending on what they think that we want to hear.

1943
02:54:59,925 --> 02:55:06,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like you raised with Tufts, if you do pass this, which I do not believe you should, you should ask for a closed trash room.

1944
02:55:06,728 --> 02:55:09,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we don't want rats running around here either.

1945
02:55:09,469 --> 02:55:13,150
[SPEAKER_07]: We would like noise spillage and light spillage to be controlled.

1946
02:55:13,670 --> 02:55:15,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Six foot head to head clearances.

1947
02:55:16,231 --> 02:55:22,557
[SPEAKER_07]: needed in shelters that are newly opening, although they give exceptions for ones that are already open, there needs to be space.

1948
02:55:23,077 --> 02:55:26,500
[SPEAKER_07]: These are people and they should be treated humanely.

1949
02:55:26,520 --> 02:55:35,248
[SPEAKER_07]: To have this many families in a 12,000 square foot building with 363 square feet per family is outrageous.

1950
02:55:35,649 --> 02:55:38,271
[SPEAKER_07]: The dentist project that the AG mentioned is a 50,000

1951
02:55:40,192 --> 02:55:47,476
[SPEAKER_07]: 57,000 square foot building for only 72 families with 790 square feet per family.

1952
02:55:47,937 --> 02:55:53,500
[SPEAKER_07]: This is overly large and treating people like cattle rather than human beings.

1953
02:55:54,200 --> 02:55:59,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also ask you to put a cap on the height in case they decide that they'd like a couple extra floors later.

1954
02:56:00,003 --> 02:56:02,004
[SPEAKER_07]: because you gave them Dover protections.

1955
02:56:02,465 --> 02:56:06,387
[SPEAKER_07]: So please be mindful that this is a for profit entity.

1956
02:56:06,727 --> 02:56:15,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And while he is intending to have a lease for five years, and with an option to renew for an additional five, they're under no obligation to do that.

1957
02:56:15,333 --> 02:56:22,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And if funding suddenly disappears, this will be an empty building or a for profit building.

1958
02:56:22,997 --> 02:56:28,001
[SPEAKER_07]: So please consider carefully as carefully at least as you consider the Tufts project this evening.

1959
02:56:28,061 --> 02:56:28,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1960
02:56:30,345 --> 02:56:31,005
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Cheryl.

1961
02:56:32,966 --> 02:56:36,347
[SPEAKER_20]: The next for public comment is Lisa Simonetti.

1962
02:56:36,367 --> 02:56:42,430
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, good evening, everyone.

1963
02:56:42,810 --> 02:56:44,491
[SPEAKER_30]: Thanks again for holding this meeting.

1964
02:56:44,531 --> 02:56:45,611
[SPEAKER_30]: I really appreciate it.

1965
02:56:46,672 --> 02:56:48,052
[SPEAKER_30]: My name is Lisa Simonetti.

1966
02:56:48,272 --> 02:56:56,215
[SPEAKER_30]: I am at 85 Fulton Spring Road, just a couple of streets up from the convent that will become a shelter.

1967
02:56:58,156 --> 02:57:03,779
[SPEAKER_30]: Cheryl stole my thunder a little bit mentioning a lot of the things that I wanted to mention very briefly.

1968
02:57:03,799 --> 02:57:09,222
[SPEAKER_30]: This was referred to as a homeless shelter tonight by one of our elected officials.

1969
02:57:09,242 --> 02:57:11,344
[SPEAKER_30]: That's a little confusing to me.

1970
02:57:11,364 --> 02:57:14,705
[SPEAKER_30]: Again, Dover is for nonprofit.

1971
02:57:15,786 --> 02:57:18,368
[SPEAKER_30]: This is a for profit landlord.

1972
02:57:19,719 --> 02:57:31,407
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'm going to mention something that I've mentioned twice at the prior two meetings is I am concerned about the lack of stability of funding for this domestic violence shelter.

1973
02:57:33,008 --> 02:57:34,409
[SPEAKER_30]: I've heard back from the lawyer.

1974
02:57:35,598 --> 02:57:39,060
[SPEAKER_30]: and a communication that was written to the city of Medford from myself.

1975
02:57:39,500 --> 02:57:42,962
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think the funding is very tenuous.

1976
02:57:43,302 --> 02:57:51,746
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'd like to know what's gonna happen if funding dries up for this quote unquote domestic violence shelter, what do we then progress to?

1977
02:57:52,347 --> 02:57:58,570
[SPEAKER_30]: I hope this is not a bait and switch because it's beginning to feel a little bit like that.

1978
02:57:59,738 --> 02:58:02,501
[SPEAKER_30]: I wanna believe that this is a domestic violence shelter.

1979
02:58:02,961 --> 02:58:07,626
[SPEAKER_30]: I wanna believe that this is a really good project for that empty building.

1980
02:58:08,266 --> 02:58:10,949
[SPEAKER_30]: It's just not feeling that way right now.

1981
02:58:12,571 --> 02:58:12,931
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1982
02:58:14,232 --> 02:58:14,893
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Lisa.

1983
02:58:17,415 --> 02:58:20,018
[SPEAKER_20]: Next in the public comment is Leo Lafarge.

1984
02:58:30,226 --> 02:58:32,548
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, can you hear me okay?

1985
02:58:33,089 --> 02:58:33,930
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, thank you.

1986
02:58:33,990 --> 02:58:34,230
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

1987
02:58:34,310 --> 02:58:41,096
[SPEAKER_26]: So, my name is Linda Mackey and I live at 463 Felsway West.

1988
02:58:41,977 --> 02:58:45,701
[SPEAKER_26]: The front door of my house is on the Felsway, but we use the back door, so I'm on St.

1989
02:58:45,761 --> 02:58:46,662
[SPEAKER_26]: Clair Road as well.

1990
02:58:47,782 --> 02:58:56,648
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted to comment again with all my other neighbors that we're very concerned about the project.

1991
02:58:56,968 --> 02:59:01,611
[SPEAKER_26]: We really do feel like this is not an educational institution.

1992
02:59:02,992 --> 02:59:04,833
[SPEAKER_26]: We feel this is more of a shelter.

1993
02:59:05,153 --> 02:59:09,856
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not going to be used for classes or things like that.

1994
02:59:11,097 --> 02:59:15,019
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm also a little concerned as right now with what's going on with the state.

1995
02:59:15,139 --> 02:59:16,300
[SPEAKER_26]: I know that there was a problem

1996
02:59:17,215 --> 02:59:23,838
[SPEAKER_26]: at some shelters that they had where background checks were not completed within the state recently.

1997
02:59:24,058 --> 02:59:36,364
[SPEAKER_26]: And there have been some questions about the Healy administration not doing everything they're supposed to.

1998
02:59:36,604 --> 02:59:40,706
[SPEAKER_26]: There's, you know, with background checks for the shelters basically is what I'm saying.

1999
02:59:40,766 --> 02:59:41,827
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think it's a good time

2000
02:59:42,430 --> 02:59:52,153
[SPEAKER_26]: that we should be thinking about a shelter in the moment with what's going on with the state, and especially with the local laws being considered for changes coming up soon.

2001
02:59:52,893 --> 02:59:55,094
[SPEAKER_26]: So I just don't think it's the right time for this.

2002
02:59:55,774 --> 03:00:06,098
[SPEAKER_26]: We're concerned about the safety of our neighborhood and our children, and the children that are proposed to be in the shelter, basically.

2003
03:00:06,798 --> 03:00:07,198
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's it.

2004
03:00:11,660 --> 03:00:12,240
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Linda.

2005
03:00:14,199 --> 03:00:21,672
[SPEAKER_20]: The next in a public comment is W E. Hey, can you hear me?

2006
03:00:22,440 --> 03:00:24,901
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, please state your name and address for the record, please.

2007
03:00:25,281 --> 03:00:25,721
[SPEAKER_39]: Sure thing.

2008
03:00:26,041 --> 03:00:27,721
[SPEAKER_39]: Waleed Al-Harash, 1 St.

2009
03:00:27,761 --> 03:00:28,301
[SPEAKER_39]: Clair Road.

2010
03:00:29,362 --> 03:00:31,262
[SPEAKER_39]: So just wanted to touch on a couple things.

2011
03:00:31,342 --> 03:00:34,783
[SPEAKER_39]: First, appreciate the Medford attorney, Attorney Stein, coming here.

2012
03:00:34,803 --> 03:00:43,965
[SPEAKER_39]: I think what she said was really important when she was reading off the kind of regulations of the Dover Amendment, specifically around bona fide educational use.

2013
03:00:44,245 --> 03:00:46,366
[SPEAKER_39]: And with this being our third meeting, I know we've heard

2014
03:00:46,946 --> 03:00:56,090
[SPEAKER_39]: over and over of this project getting referred to as a homeless shelter, then DV shelter, and even Councilor, I think Lazzaro also calling it a homeless shelter.

2015
03:00:56,530 --> 03:00:58,951
[SPEAKER_39]: I think that's something really important for the board to keep in mind.

2016
03:00:58,971 --> 03:01:12,617
[SPEAKER_39]: Because I think we've seen some breadcrumbs time and time again that, you know, this is more or less kind of a circumvention of specific rules trying to push through something under the guise of an educational purpose, but essentially for a,

2017
03:01:13,157 --> 03:01:14,218
[SPEAKER_39]: for-profit developer.

2018
03:01:14,538 --> 03:01:26,505
[SPEAKER_39]: Um, I also wanted to highlight something attorney racer said that I caught as well in the new, um, documentation, which is pretty much the least that was submitted is clearly contingent on getting the Dover amendment passed.

2019
03:01:26,686 --> 03:01:33,290
[SPEAKER_39]: And I think that's a pretty kind of glaring example of, you know, kind of the circumvention that's being tried here for the Dover amendment.

2020
03:01:33,570 --> 03:01:39,694
[SPEAKER_39]: And, uh, the last piece that I want to touch on, and I'm not sure if it made it into public record was an email I sent in

2021
03:01:40,676 --> 03:01:43,019
[SPEAKER_39]: to the board on December 1st at 11 a.m.

2022
03:01:43,039 --> 03:01:48,025
[SPEAKER_39]: just regarding the parking because I know one of the members, I think it was Ben, brought it up.

2023
03:01:48,105 --> 03:01:48,846
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm just not sure.

2024
03:01:48,946 --> 03:01:50,388
[SPEAKER_39]: Did that make it into the record or not?

2025
03:01:50,408 --> 03:01:52,690
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me check.

2026
03:01:52,710 --> 03:01:54,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle or Alicia, I don't know if you have...

2027
03:01:54,962 --> 03:01:57,844
[SPEAKER_20]: easy access, but why don't you keep talking just because we've got time.

2028
03:01:58,104 --> 03:02:02,727
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, I just wanted to bring that up because I think Ben mentioned it as a really good point.

2029
03:02:03,768 --> 03:02:06,810
[SPEAKER_39]: The parking here and traffic is insane.

2030
03:02:06,850 --> 03:02:09,372
[SPEAKER_39]: We have the church there doing frequent events.

2031
03:02:09,392 --> 03:02:15,196
[SPEAKER_39]: There's another community center literally 20 feet away from this proposed site that does events as well.

2032
03:02:15,396 --> 03:02:16,657
[SPEAKER_39]: The pictures I sent in

2033
03:02:17,257 --> 03:02:20,619
[SPEAKER_39]: were taken on a random Tuesday and Thursday respectively.

2034
03:02:21,100 --> 03:02:27,604
[SPEAKER_39]: You'll see from the pictures the parking lots jammed full, people are parked in the fire lanes, parked diagonally, etc.

2035
03:02:27,644 --> 03:02:30,606
[SPEAKER_39]: I think that needs to be brought into consideration as well.

2036
03:02:31,026 --> 03:02:38,851
[SPEAKER_39]: One last thing that I'm not sure if was talked about since the last meeting was, I don't know if there was an update on the whole public versus private way on St.

2037
03:02:38,891 --> 03:02:41,593
[SPEAKER_39]: Clair or not, but that's the time I got.

2038
03:02:43,198 --> 03:02:43,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2039
03:02:43,778 --> 03:02:59,430
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will confirm that we have comments from you around the time of Wednesday, December 6th, as well as, I want to make sure to get the date right here, Sunday, December 1st.

2040
03:03:03,894 --> 03:03:05,875
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are in the old public comments.

2041
03:03:05,955 --> 03:03:09,598
[SPEAKER_20]: We might have new ones in the current ones.

2042
03:03:12,342 --> 03:03:13,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are the ones that I see.

2043
03:03:16,984 --> 03:03:22,725
[SPEAKER_20]: But I would encourage you to message Danielle or Alicia if the dates of those public comments do not align with the ones that you sent.

2044
03:03:23,106 --> 03:03:27,147
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to make sure to have those in and allow the board to review those.

2045
03:03:28,967 --> 03:03:32,108
[SPEAKER_20]: I see next for public comment is Barry Ingber.

2046
03:03:36,250 --> 03:03:39,651
[SPEAKER_20]: Please state your name and address for the record after you unmute.

2047
03:03:43,452 --> 03:03:46,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to unmute, and I couldn't do it.

2048
03:03:46,696 --> 03:03:47,236
[SPEAKER_06]: We got you.

2049
03:03:47,957 --> 03:03:55,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Barry Ingber, 9 Traper Street, North Medford, just a couple blocks north of the proposed domestic violence shelter.

2050
03:03:56,787 --> 03:04:04,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to express my wholehearted support for this project, and I want to respond to a couple of the objections.

2051
03:04:05,933 --> 03:04:11,437
[SPEAKER_06]: that there's no guarantee of it being serving this purpose in the long run.

2052
03:04:11,457 --> 03:04:18,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I would encourage the Community Development Board to put that in its conditions when it approves the project.

2053
03:04:19,925 --> 03:04:28,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And second, all these statements about it not being a domestic violence shelter, but it being a homeless shelter,

2054
03:04:29,356 --> 03:04:40,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazzaro just used a homeless shelter as an example of a case where non-profits rent from for-profits.

2055
03:04:41,761 --> 03:04:44,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And she did not refer to this as a homeless shelter.

2056
03:04:44,742 --> 03:04:48,444
[SPEAKER_06]: The only people who have referred to this as a homeless shelter have been opponents.

2057
03:04:49,484 --> 03:04:52,306
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not a homeless shelter, it is a domestic violence shelter.

2058
03:04:53,026 --> 03:04:57,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is something that is sorely needed in our community, and I encourage you all to pass it.

2059
03:04:57,848 --> 03:04:58,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2060
03:05:00,156 --> 03:05:00,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2061
03:05:09,407 --> 03:05:16,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia or Danielle, have we received any emails while we've been in this period?

2062
03:05:19,347 --> 03:05:23,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Two, wait, let me double check my, we've been trying to upload them at the same time.

2063
03:05:24,849 --> 03:05:28,291
[SPEAKER_15]: This evening, I'm just, sorry.

2064
03:05:31,512 --> 03:05:36,674
[SPEAKER_15]: That we're in favor of supportive of a homeless shelter.

2065
03:05:36,734 --> 03:05:40,656
[SPEAKER_15]: There was one at seven or 630 from Jones Sear.

2066
03:05:41,336 --> 03:05:44,758
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was uploaded as this meeting was started.

2067
03:05:44,778 --> 03:05:45,478
[SPEAKER_15]: I see that one.

2068
03:05:46,428 --> 03:05:51,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and there was one with questions.

2069
03:05:52,731 --> 03:05:55,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I do not believe Kathleen Kelly spoke this evening.

2070
03:05:55,813 --> 03:05:58,994
[SPEAKER_15]: She emailed us a couple of questions this evening.

2071
03:05:59,014 --> 03:06:04,357
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just trying to summarize them.

2072
03:06:04,797 --> 03:06:07,158
[SPEAKER_15]: So one was what happens after the end of the lease term.

2073
03:06:09,505 --> 03:06:24,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Another was a concern about safety, but about the idea that it can't, that if Medford residents were placed in a domestic violence shelter where everybody knew the address, then that wouldn't be very safe for those residents.

2074
03:06:27,249 --> 03:06:31,710
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there was some questioning about the Dover exemption and the for-profit developers.

2075
03:06:31,770 --> 03:06:37,752
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that that's absolutely been articulated by other speakers this evening.

2076
03:06:44,054 --> 03:06:44,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

2077
03:06:44,634 --> 03:06:46,736
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, that's basically it.

2078
03:06:46,876 --> 03:06:49,518
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I was trying to read and talk at the same time.

2079
03:06:49,538 --> 03:06:50,258
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.

2080
03:06:50,719 --> 03:06:52,580
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do see another public comment.

2081
03:06:53,521 --> 03:06:55,282
[SPEAKER_20]: Paulette Vartabedian.

2082
03:06:55,302 --> 03:07:01,526
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you please state your name and address for the record?

2083
03:07:01,546 --> 03:07:09,932
[SPEAKER_20]: Paulette, are you able to unmute yourself?

2084
03:07:28,524 --> 03:07:33,265
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to make sure we get your comment in during the public comment period.

2085
03:07:34,525 --> 03:07:37,126
[SPEAKER_20]: But it seems like we're having some technical difficulties.

2086
03:07:37,146 --> 03:07:49,028
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you're listening, I would say please email the board, OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

2087
03:07:49,848 --> 03:07:57,110
[SPEAKER_20]: You're also welcome to send a chat to Danielle or Alicia if you're having any technical difficulties.

2088
03:07:57,690 --> 03:07:57,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia?

2089
03:07:58,828 --> 03:08:03,309
[SPEAKER_15]: And there is one other person who has direct messaged me that they're having trouble raising their hand.

2090
03:08:03,329 --> 03:08:06,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think we've heard from Lily R. Okay.

2091
03:08:06,849 --> 03:08:06,969
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2092
03:08:06,989 --> 03:08:08,730
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just, I see another person.

2093
03:08:08,750 --> 03:08:10,050
[SPEAKER_20]: So Paulette, we'll come back to you.

2094
03:08:10,070 --> 03:08:17,191
[SPEAKER_20]: I see participant has raised their hand.

2095
03:08:17,271 --> 03:08:21,172
[SPEAKER_20]: Participant, can you please state your name and address for the record, please?

2096
03:08:22,952 --> 03:08:24,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Arthur Crawford, Fulton Street.

2097
03:08:25,613 --> 03:08:26,573
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, can you say that again?

2098
03:08:27,229 --> 03:08:29,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Arthur Crawford, Fulton Street.

2099
03:08:29,910 --> 03:08:30,531
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Arthur.

2100
03:08:32,192 --> 03:08:32,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Board.

2101
03:08:33,452 --> 03:08:37,875
[SPEAKER_03]: The applicant is attempting to manipulate the zoning bylaws by abusing the Dover Amendment.

2102
03:08:38,335 --> 03:08:41,617
[SPEAKER_03]: The applicant provided resume information, both written and verbally.

2103
03:08:42,457 --> 03:08:59,521
[SPEAKER_03]: typically focusing on the applicant would be a discriminatory act, but the applicant's claimant of Dover protections demands this board review these and any other materials related to the applicant's history, similar to reviewing any licensee or permittee application.

2104
03:08:59,681 --> 03:09:04,523
[SPEAKER_20]: At this time, Arthur, I'm going to have to close your comment.

2105
03:09:06,563 --> 03:09:09,706
[SPEAKER_20]: personal or professional history of the applicants is not under review.

2106
03:09:10,067 --> 03:09:15,052
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have additional comments about other topics, I encourage you to voice those.

2107
03:09:15,072 --> 03:09:21,839
[SPEAKER_20]: But we will not be speaking of the personal or professional history of the applicants.

2108
03:09:22,180 --> 03:09:22,440
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2109
03:09:22,460 --> 03:09:24,823
[SPEAKER_03]: The professional history of the applicant wouldn't be important though.

2110
03:09:25,864 --> 03:09:27,506
[SPEAKER_03]: We're reviewing the resume.

2111
03:09:27,526 --> 03:09:28,587
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's not.

2112
03:09:29,798 --> 03:09:31,740
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what makes the Dover amendment.

2113
03:09:31,780 --> 03:09:36,363
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this time, we're going in another direction, but I that is my question.

2114
03:09:37,024 --> 03:09:43,409
[SPEAKER_20]: But okay, we are not subject to review the personal or professional history of the applicant.

2115
03:09:43,970 --> 03:09:44,350
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2116
03:09:46,191 --> 03:09:46,532
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2117
03:09:46,672 --> 03:09:52,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So the applicant has never referred to the occupants in the record as students.

2118
03:09:53,410 --> 03:09:56,193
[SPEAKER_03]: They most consistently referred to them as residents.

2119
03:09:56,993 --> 03:10:10,486
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a compelling fact for the board to consider as the applicant in their own words solidifies in the record that the users of this building's primary and dominant use is for lodging, not educational use.

2120
03:10:11,529 --> 03:10:22,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And my follow up is simply one of the neighbors had information that asked a very compelling question to the applicant.

2121
03:10:22,371 --> 03:10:24,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you park when the building is empty?

2122
03:10:25,372 --> 03:10:29,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget one that's full of 34 rooms and all these people and everything else.

2123
03:10:30,053 --> 03:10:31,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you park now?

2124
03:10:32,674 --> 03:10:33,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Illegally.

2125
03:10:33,254 --> 03:10:34,934
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate it.

2126
03:10:34,974 --> 03:10:35,634
[SPEAKER_20]: Your time is up.

2127
03:10:37,775 --> 03:10:38,535
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for your comment.

2128
03:10:41,993 --> 03:10:45,495
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to go back to Paulette Vartabedian.

2129
03:10:47,435 --> 03:10:48,776
[SPEAKER_20]: Paulette, are you able to unmute?

2130
03:10:48,796 --> 03:10:59,740
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, and Lily R., I believe, was the name that you gave, Alicia.

2131
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:02,321
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm looking for that in the attendees.

2132
03:11:02,381 --> 03:11:03,582
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, I gently unmute.

2133
03:11:04,582 --> 03:11:04,762
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2134
03:11:15,235 --> 03:11:19,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Lily, can you unmute again and give your name and address for the record?

2135
03:11:24,166 --> 03:11:24,747
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, sorry.

2136
03:11:24,767 --> 03:11:27,951
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm having some technical difficulties here.

2137
03:11:28,371 --> 03:11:29,092
[SPEAKER_20]: We can hear you now.

2138
03:11:29,112 --> 03:11:34,599
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a little echoey, but we should be able to get it.

2139
03:11:35,857 --> 03:11:37,878
[SPEAKER_20]: Sometimes it helps if you turn down your own volume.

2140
03:11:38,138 --> 03:11:38,438
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

2141
03:11:38,879 --> 03:11:39,459
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I'm learning.

2142
03:11:39,619 --> 03:11:42,780
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm just reiterating that the community does not want this.

2143
03:11:43,861 --> 03:11:45,222
[SPEAKER_34]: It's not what's best for us.

2144
03:11:45,622 --> 03:11:55,987
[SPEAKER_34]: We've all decided this in the neighborhood and I really hope that the board would respect that and what everyone's thinking because this is not going to be safe.

2145
03:11:58,148 --> 03:11:59,709
[SPEAKER_34]: There's not a real plan in place.

2146
03:12:00,889 --> 03:12:06,590
[SPEAKER_34]: And the words, everyone's words has been changed 100 times about what it's called, what it's going to be.

2147
03:12:07,490 --> 03:12:09,451
[SPEAKER_34]: And it's just not professional.

2148
03:12:09,911 --> 03:12:10,731
[SPEAKER_34]: It's not a plan.

2149
03:12:11,131 --> 03:12:12,051
[SPEAKER_34]: And we need more time.

2150
03:12:13,091 --> 03:12:13,471
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2151
03:12:14,932 --> 03:12:15,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Lily.

2152
03:12:18,212 --> 03:12:21,933
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to go back to Paulette Vartabedian.

2153
03:12:25,953 --> 03:12:28,854
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do see Kathy has their hand up.

2154
03:12:31,444 --> 03:12:34,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Kathy, are you able to unmute and say your name and address for the record, please?

2155
03:12:35,887 --> 03:12:37,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Kathy.

2156
03:12:37,328 --> 03:12:45,393
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm at 52 Russell Street and just a few blocks up from the potential domestic violence shelter.

2157
03:12:46,193 --> 03:12:47,634
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a couple of concerns.

2158
03:12:49,816 --> 03:12:54,979
[SPEAKER_12]: One of them is the abutter notification and the requirements and how that was done.

2159
03:12:55,779 --> 03:12:58,960
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was wondering if maybe somebody from the board can explain.

2160
03:12:58,980 --> 03:13:10,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I know the abutter list that was uploaded to the portal looks to be like a hundred foot abutter list from what I could see from the GIS maps.

2161
03:13:11,722 --> 03:13:18,864
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe, well, my understanding is Mass General Law requires 300 foot abutter notification.

2162
03:13:19,684 --> 03:13:23,945
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the city ordinance might be 400, but at very minimum,

2163
03:13:24,667 --> 03:13:26,248
[SPEAKER_12]: MGL is 300 foot.

2164
03:13:27,788 --> 03:13:35,890
[SPEAKER_12]: And the certification was dated March 12.

2165
03:13:37,031 --> 03:13:42,112
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think notification went out sometime middle of October, if I'm not mistaken.

2166
03:13:42,893 --> 03:13:47,514
[SPEAKER_12]: So that, to me, is concerning because butters can change.

2167
03:13:48,810 --> 03:13:50,171
[SPEAKER_12]: over a six-month time frame.

2168
03:13:50,712 --> 03:14:00,598
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe not everybody was in receipt, but certainly only the 100 foot appears to be used if that's what is tied to this project.

2169
03:14:01,179 --> 03:14:06,783
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a concern from a professional standpoint, because I do this all day for a living.

2170
03:14:06,803 --> 03:14:17,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Another concern I have is, you know, it's proposed use as a domestic violence shelter, which is, you know,

2171
03:14:18,702 --> 03:14:24,345
[SPEAKER_12]: a great proposal to be used for domestic violence, but everybody keeps mentioning homeless shelter.

2172
03:14:24,945 --> 03:14:29,147
[SPEAKER_12]: And Alicia herself just said that not more than five minutes ago.

2173
03:14:30,207 --> 03:14:38,411
[SPEAKER_12]: My last concern is the use of the word recidivism in the deck, the slide deck that I've seen.

2174
03:14:39,092 --> 03:14:41,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Recidivism and domestic violence victims

2175
03:14:42,704 --> 03:14:52,248
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think those terms should be used in the same sentence ever because the definition of recidivism certainly does not fit a victim of domestic violence.

2176
03:14:53,408 --> 03:14:54,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Kathy.

2177
03:14:54,148 --> 03:14:56,349
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate the comments.

2178
03:14:58,050 --> 03:14:58,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2179
03:14:59,010 --> 03:14:59,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2180
03:15:03,212 --> 03:15:05,833
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, Paulette, we're going to come back to you.

2181
03:15:07,721 --> 03:15:24,788
[SPEAKER_20]: If this doesn't work out then, as mentioned before, I would encourage you to email OCD at Medford dash ma.gov or message Danielle or Alicia either to help troubleshoot or directly with any insight on what's going on.

2182
03:15:25,908 --> 03:15:28,089
[SPEAKER_20]: Paulette, are you able to unmute yourself?

2183
03:15:39,497 --> 03:15:47,639
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, it seems like Paulette is not able to unmute, but I do see a new hand.

2184
03:15:48,320 --> 03:15:53,181
[SPEAKER_20]: Patricia Scappelli, are you able to unmute yourself?

2185
03:15:54,681 --> 03:15:56,582
[SPEAKER_20]: And please state your name and address for the record.

2186
03:15:57,792 --> 03:16:00,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Patricia Ciapelli, 53 Garfield Avenue.

2187
03:16:00,734 --> 03:16:09,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to note that the residents, the voters, the taxpayers, the homeowners that have made this neighborhood are against this.

2188
03:16:10,202 --> 03:16:13,044
[SPEAKER_04]: They have rights just as everyone else does.

2189
03:16:13,425 --> 03:16:19,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are ready to appeal this and fight this in court however we have to.

2190
03:16:21,992 --> 03:16:22,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2191
03:16:22,372 --> 03:16:24,834
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Patricia.

2192
03:16:31,744 --> 03:16:37,487
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia or Danielle, any messages through the chat of any technical issues that we should address?

2193
03:16:37,507 --> 03:16:45,592
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just checking my personal email as well as OCD.

2194
03:16:45,732 --> 03:16:46,733
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not seeing that.

2195
03:16:46,933 --> 03:16:51,916
[SPEAKER_15]: I have not received a message through the chat or any additional ones.

2196
03:16:52,656 --> 03:16:52,916
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

2197
03:16:53,176 --> 03:16:56,999
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this time, we are going to close the public comment period for this meeting.

2198
03:16:58,475 --> 03:17:14,911
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to hand it over to the applicant to briefly address, and I know that some of these are not new concepts, so I appreciate your willingness to continue to address these, but to address any comments from the public.

2199
03:17:14,931 --> 03:17:17,313
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'll hand it over to Attorney Ross at this time.

2200
03:17:17,830 --> 03:17:19,050
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

2201
03:17:19,710 --> 03:17:22,231
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll do it in the order that it transpired.

2202
03:17:22,751 --> 03:17:31,472
[SPEAKER_40]: And I'll start with Member Lavalle, his point on, and hopefully I'm getting this right.

2203
03:17:31,492 --> 03:17:46,895
[SPEAKER_40]: I think you were asking about whether or not the condition of the not allowing residents to use the permit parking program, whether or not, how we felt about that.

2204
03:17:48,023 --> 03:17:48,843
[SPEAKER_40]: If I got that right.

2205
03:17:49,944 --> 03:17:50,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you got that right.

2206
03:17:50,784 --> 03:17:56,645
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's significant concerns around parking capacity in that neighborhood already being extremely limited.

2207
03:17:57,486 --> 03:18:02,707
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just don't feel that the parking situation has been addressed.

2208
03:18:03,887 --> 03:18:06,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so just maybe elaborate if you don't mind.

2209
03:18:07,208 --> 03:18:08,489
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, no problem.

2210
03:18:08,729 --> 03:18:13,310
[SPEAKER_40]: I mean, I guess I'd say a few things about parking and number one, we've heard in testimony from Tasia who's here.

2211
03:18:14,647 --> 03:18:27,491
[SPEAKER_40]: from her running of these other facilities that virtually no guest, or no guests, let's remove the word virtually, in her other facilities has a car that they brought with them.

2212
03:18:28,031 --> 03:18:29,192
[SPEAKER_40]: We've heard that repeatedly.

2213
03:18:29,792 --> 03:18:32,673
[SPEAKER_40]: The issue really is that limited to staff.

2214
03:18:32,993 --> 03:18:39,195
[SPEAKER_40]: And we've heard in testimony that staff would be limited to about three or four members at a given time.

2215
03:18:40,330 --> 03:18:59,794
[SPEAKER_40]: And so what we did to mitigate any concern about staff bringing cars, because we do not believe nor will we allow residents to bring cars, is that there would be a shuttle, and the shuttle would be a commitment of this project.

2216
03:19:00,454 --> 03:19:02,335
[SPEAKER_40]: We would agree to have it written into the

2217
03:19:04,075 --> 03:19:14,879
[SPEAKER_40]: Conditions for this project and that shuttle would be the way people get back and forth from the tea and then also safe trips bring people to.

2218
03:19:17,595 --> 03:19:19,597
[SPEAKER_40]: to like shopping areas and that kind of thing.

2219
03:19:20,898 --> 03:19:26,983
[SPEAKER_40]: We think that that, I would add to that, that we had Fasun O'Neill conduct a study for us.

2220
03:19:27,283 --> 03:19:33,709
[SPEAKER_40]: Fasun O'Neill observed that the previous use has the same technical off throw of

2221
03:19:34,569 --> 03:19:37,591
[SPEAKER_40]: cars as what this proposed use is.

2222
03:19:38,271 --> 03:19:52,277
[SPEAKER_40]: From their report, they identified no increase, no statistical, no mathematical increase to the number of cars based on their licensed engineering profession, and we presented that information

2223
03:19:53,052 --> 03:19:53,612
[SPEAKER_40]: to the board.

2224
03:19:54,333 --> 03:20:09,318
[SPEAKER_40]: I will say that the applicant has identified within several hundred feet, two parking spaces that he and she will use for if it's needed.

2225
03:20:09,658 --> 03:20:14,840
[SPEAKER_40]: So we are in the process of negotiating the final details on that.

2226
03:20:14,980 --> 03:20:19,042
[SPEAKER_40]: If I had the signed letter, I would bring it to the board.

2227
03:20:20,816 --> 03:20:43,895
[SPEAKER_40]: Here, I would be reluctant to bring an unsigned letter to the board on something of this nature, but I can represent to you that we believe we will have two parking spaces within several hundred feet of this facility, and so that next time the owner of this building goes to the building, he'll have a place that he could park if he needed to do so.

2228
03:20:44,896 --> 03:20:46,016
[SPEAKER_40]: So that's the parking piece.

2229
03:20:46,136 --> 03:20:47,277
[SPEAKER_40]: We can come back to it, of course.

2230
03:20:47,757 --> 03:20:57,120
[SPEAKER_40]: I did want to address Attorney Racer's comments, really his reliance on this case, the Sullivan case.

2231
03:20:57,760 --> 03:21:00,501
[SPEAKER_40]: Sullivan is not a good case for Attorney Racer.

2232
03:21:00,581 --> 03:21:05,683
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know why he's relying on it so completely.

2233
03:21:06,323 --> 03:21:13,145
[SPEAKER_40]: Sullivan deals with a nonprofit organization that was focused on early American history on Cape Cod.

2234
03:21:14,323 --> 03:21:20,129
[SPEAKER_40]: They decided to create a newly formed for-profit business.

2235
03:21:20,349 --> 03:21:35,403
[SPEAKER_40]: The non-profit decided to create a for-profit business, which it only held a minority share of ownership within, unlike this situation where our non-profit is 100% non-profit and it's not a for-profit entity.

2236
03:21:36,442 --> 03:21:58,759
[SPEAKER_40]: And the purpose of this nonprofit that this for profit, that this nonprofit created was to create an amusement park style ropes course within the 100 acre campus to create more revenue sources that had zero nexus to its nonprofit use of being in this early American history educational

2237
03:22:00,320 --> 03:22:12,911
[SPEAKER_40]: Museum, and to compare that use to that of a domestic violence shelter and then ask the board to deny it based on that comparison, I believe is a reckless use of case law.

2238
03:22:13,252 --> 03:22:20,618
[SPEAKER_40]: The better case is a case called Watros versus Greater Lynn Mental Health and Retardation Association.

2239
03:22:21,359 --> 03:22:34,411
[SPEAKER_40]: This was a Massachusetts Supreme Court case where they unambiguously support the notion that a non-profit entity may enjoy the protections of Dover even when it is a leasing from a for-profit landlord.

2240
03:22:34,831 --> 03:22:41,497
[SPEAKER_40]: And in the case of Watrous, even when only a portion of the property is for the Dover protected use.

2241
03:22:41,657 --> 03:22:47,402
[SPEAKER_40]: The quote that they said was, if we were to construe Dover as the plaintiffs argue we should,

2242
03:22:48,283 --> 03:23:00,033
[SPEAKER_40]: only those non-profit educational corporations with sufficient financial resources to lease or purchase an entire property would enjoy the protection of Dover.

2243
03:23:00,594 --> 03:23:08,160
[SPEAKER_40]: Such a constrictive result is neither required by the straight language of the statute nor consistent with its purpose.

2244
03:23:08,500 --> 03:23:10,242
[SPEAKER_40]: So that's all I have to say about case law.

2245
03:23:10,882 --> 03:23:15,226
[SPEAKER_40]: On the other comments that came in, you know, I agree with the

2246
03:23:17,723 --> 03:23:24,428
[SPEAKER_40]: Barry, Mr. Ingber, that Councilor Lazzaro's comment was clearly just illustrative.

2247
03:23:25,789 --> 03:23:34,135
[SPEAKER_40]: In any case, our whole going from the larger shelter to the smaller, more narrow use of the domestic violence use,

2248
03:23:34,978 --> 03:23:36,460
[SPEAKER_40]: is a benefit.

2249
03:23:36,901 --> 03:23:47,814
[SPEAKER_40]: It's intended to respond to the community concerns that the shelter was too unwieldy, too undefined use.

2250
03:23:48,235 --> 03:23:52,160
[SPEAKER_40]: That's why we went to the more refined definition of the

2251
03:23:53,187 --> 03:23:57,528
[SPEAKER_40]: of the domestic violence use.

2252
03:23:58,128 --> 03:24:12,031
[SPEAKER_40]: We are now putting ourselves in a situation where if that use no longer ceases to exist, we are now out of compliance with our own conditions and therefore arguably would not be able to continue to operate under the Dover protections.

2253
03:24:12,091 --> 03:24:13,832
[SPEAKER_40]: We would have to come back to this board.

2254
03:24:14,552 --> 03:24:17,193
[SPEAKER_40]: Likewise, we can't just add height to this building.

2255
03:24:17,613 --> 03:24:18,593
[SPEAKER_40]: That was a comment that

2256
03:24:20,345 --> 03:24:21,946
[SPEAKER_40]: that someone else made as well.

2257
03:24:23,888 --> 03:24:24,028
[SPEAKER_40]: Ms.

2258
03:24:24,068 --> 03:24:28,270
[SPEAKER_40]: Russo talked about 40 rooms, it's not 40 rooms, it's 34 rooms.

2259
03:24:28,830 --> 03:24:39,857
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes, there are three flex rooms, but in terms of dedicated, so that's 37 at the absolute most, but it's 34 as in terms of dedicated rooms that are only bedrooms.

2260
03:24:42,307 --> 03:24:45,069
[SPEAKER_40]: In the end, she concluded saying that we are opposed to this use.

2261
03:24:45,449 --> 03:24:48,651
[SPEAKER_40]: That is precisely what the Dover Amendment exists for.

2262
03:24:49,051 --> 03:25:00,658
[SPEAKER_40]: It exists for situations like this, where neighbors nearby a use that they don't like in their neighborhood band together and try to kill something based on the fact that they don't like it.

2263
03:25:01,038 --> 03:25:02,319
[SPEAKER_40]: That's why Dover exists.

2264
03:25:02,619 --> 03:25:05,621
[SPEAKER_40]: They don't want these people in their neighborhood.

2265
03:25:05,981 --> 03:25:08,363
[SPEAKER_40]: That is why Dover exists.

2266
03:25:09,020 --> 03:25:14,604
[SPEAKER_40]: Cheryl said that, what happens after 10 years?

2267
03:25:14,664 --> 03:25:15,905
[SPEAKER_40]: I've already answered that question.

2268
03:25:16,466 --> 03:25:30,416
[SPEAKER_40]: After 10 years, we would love to renew with this user, but because it's going to be a condition of our special permit, I think someone recommended that, or of this board's, if you should pass this, it would be a condition.

2269
03:25:31,097 --> 03:25:35,760
[SPEAKER_40]: If we are no longer renting to this entity or this use, we are now out of compliance.

2270
03:25:36,140 --> 03:25:37,962
[SPEAKER_40]: We are now no longer protected.

2271
03:25:38,542 --> 03:25:40,083
[SPEAKER_40]: uh, and covered by the Dover Amendment.

2272
03:25:40,103 --> 03:25:42,545
[SPEAKER_40]: We're willing to live with that as a condition.

2273
03:25:43,305 --> 03:25:44,005
[SPEAKER_40]: Uh, Ms.

2274
03:25:44,206 --> 03:25:48,308
[SPEAKER_40]: Simonetti, uh, had, I felt, had very thoughtful comments.

2275
03:25:48,848 --> 03:25:52,891
[SPEAKER_40]: We appreciate that she does want to support domestic violent use in this space.

2276
03:25:55,648 --> 03:26:06,891
[SPEAKER_40]: use that will be in this space, domestic violence use, that is what we're going to put on the conditions of this permit.

2277
03:26:07,271 --> 03:26:10,272
[SPEAKER_40]: And we would then have to live up to that condition.

2278
03:26:11,392 --> 03:26:13,633
[SPEAKER_40]: We're required to live up to the conditions of the permit.

2279
03:26:13,693 --> 03:26:14,853
[SPEAKER_40]: So we appreciate that comment.

2280
03:26:16,622 --> 03:26:17,823
[SPEAKER_40]: Others talked about funding.

2281
03:26:18,724 --> 03:26:22,346
[SPEAKER_40]: We are not a state entity, we are a non-profit entity.

2282
03:26:22,786 --> 03:26:25,608
[SPEAKER_40]: That non-profit entity operates other businesses.

2283
03:26:26,329 --> 03:26:26,489
[SPEAKER_40]: Ms.

2284
03:26:26,529 --> 03:26:39,058
[SPEAKER_40]: Koshari could talk more about how she's able to keep her doors open despite difficult budgets in the state, but she's able to do so and she's able to now do so here again.

2285
03:26:39,938 --> 03:27:07,216
[SPEAKER_40]: um letter what happens after the lease again after the lease we'd have to remain in compliance we can't just somehow after the lease now rent this out for any use we want not be allowed to do that we would be in violation of the conditions of this permit lily r mentioned that she does not want this again that's why dover exists um about our notification concerns we we actually re notified uh for kathy's comment

2286
03:27:07,929 --> 03:27:09,352
[SPEAKER_40]: The, the entire neighborhood.

2287
03:27:10,054 --> 03:27:15,107
[SPEAKER_40]: A second time, just to be perfectly clear and sure that we did cover the, the.

2288
03:27:18,365 --> 03:27:18,765
[SPEAKER_40]: community.

2289
03:27:19,626 --> 03:27:24,769
[SPEAKER_40]: And again, I think Patricia Ciappelli also said, we're against this.

2290
03:27:24,789 --> 03:27:26,170
[SPEAKER_40]: And that's why the Dover is one other point.

2291
03:27:26,230 --> 03:27:26,830
[SPEAKER_40]: It was W.E.

2292
03:27:27,150 --> 03:27:28,671
[SPEAKER_40]: I think it's Waleed or W.E.

2293
03:27:29,752 --> 03:27:31,533
[SPEAKER_40]: said something about a lease permitting contingency.

2294
03:27:31,893 --> 03:27:33,434
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm a commercial real estate attorney.

2295
03:27:33,454 --> 03:27:42,359
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't think I've ever seen a lease in my life that doesn't have a permitting contingency in it for commercial transactions like this one.

2296
03:27:42,619 --> 03:27:51,301
[SPEAKER_40]: The whole point of a permanent contingency in a lease is that if we get rejected by this board, we don't have to now enter into a lease with Ms.

2297
03:27:51,321 --> 03:27:52,861
[SPEAKER_40]: Gashard's nonprofit.

2298
03:27:53,141 --> 03:27:56,302
[SPEAKER_40]: That is what the permanent contingency does.

2299
03:27:56,362 --> 03:28:01,163
[SPEAKER_40]: It's in pretty much every commercial lease that comes before boards like this.

2300
03:28:01,183 --> 03:28:02,903
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll pause there, Madam Chair.

2301
03:28:02,923 --> 03:28:04,664
[SPEAKER_40]: Hopefully I was able to answer most of those questions.

2302
03:28:05,624 --> 03:28:06,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2303
03:28:07,104 --> 03:28:11,505
[SPEAKER_20]: I see board member Peter Kalb's hand is raised.

2304
03:28:13,960 --> 03:28:16,241
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter, do you have something you wanted to add?

2305
03:28:17,141 --> 03:28:35,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I just wanted to, as you so kindly described me as our resident transportation expert earlier, I just wanted to bring some clarity from my day job into some of Ben's comments about parking.

2306
03:28:36,128 --> 03:28:40,670
[SPEAKER_10]: As someone who works on a lot of land development projects,

2307
03:28:41,631 --> 03:29:09,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Similar in scope to this in other locations, we work a lot with what is called transportation demand management, where projects will be required to prove to boards such as this how they are going to manage the trips to and from their

2308
03:29:10,406 --> 03:29:36,948
[SPEAKER_10]: their site and i think the the shuttle service the shuttle service that uh attorney ross describes is is an example of that and i think and i believe that's written into uh that's written into the draft conditions as uh have already been uh uh advised by the city uh city staff and just as someone who works with these kind of

2309
03:29:38,198 --> 03:30:07,042
[SPEAKER_10]: uses all the time in other places professionally these kind of institutional uses things of this nature are notably very good about transportation demand management they have a very kind of firm grasp on what on what trips they're bringing it's a very it's as opposed to a standard a more standard commercial retail something like that these kind of uses have a very good handle in my experience on uh

2310
03:30:08,611 --> 03:30:10,972
[SPEAKER_10]: who they're bringing to the site and how they're getting there.

2311
03:30:10,992 --> 03:30:19,035
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's something that I wanted to kind of bring my experience in dealing with that, that that's something that I would not anticipate being a concern.

2312
03:30:20,816 --> 03:30:22,197
[SPEAKER_20]: That's really helpful insight, Peter.

2313
03:30:22,217 --> 03:30:23,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much for adding that.

2314
03:30:25,478 --> 03:30:32,201
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'd like to open it up to additional members of the board, ask any questions, provide requests for more information.

2315
03:30:33,867 --> 03:30:36,588
[SPEAKER_20]: We can deliberate on the proposal, we can start talking conditions.

2316
03:30:38,128 --> 03:30:38,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari.

2317
03:30:38,468 --> 03:30:44,190
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam Chair and the applicant and public comments.

2318
03:30:45,170 --> 03:30:52,292
[SPEAKER_21]: I had a couple of questions I wanted to just make sure we have a firm grasp on.

2319
03:30:52,312 --> 03:30:56,053
[SPEAKER_21]: The first one is, I remember there was some discussion on whether

2320
03:30:57,162 --> 03:30:59,203
[SPEAKER_21]: the street is a public or private way.

2321
03:30:59,283 --> 03:31:02,124
[SPEAKER_21]: Can someone confirm which one it is?

2322
03:31:03,305 --> 03:31:08,927
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know that it makes a huge effect on the decision, but that's something that I would like to know.

2323
03:31:10,268 --> 03:31:20,953
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would also like to hear Attorney Stein's opinion confirming that a nonprofit renting from a for-profit

2324
03:31:22,370 --> 03:31:29,176
[SPEAKER_21]: developer is okay under Dover, my understanding is that it is, but we have legal counsel and I'd love to have that confirmed as well.

2325
03:31:31,097 --> 03:31:39,984
[SPEAKER_20]: Can the city provide any insight regarding board members' first question about the status of St.

2326
03:31:40,024 --> 03:31:42,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Clair Road, probably known as, I think, Love Lane?

2327
03:31:45,889 --> 03:31:47,470
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, can you hear me okay?

2328
03:31:47,550 --> 03:31:50,192
[SPEAKER_32]: I took off my headphones because they were hurting my ears.

2329
03:31:52,183 --> 03:32:03,920
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, I spoke with the city engineer the other day, and he and the dpw commissioner considering it a derelict private way, meaning at some point.

2330
03:32:06,386 --> 03:32:10,027
[SPEAKER_32]: the neighborhood or whoever was there tried to like donate it to the city.

2331
03:32:10,047 --> 03:32:12,828
[SPEAKER_32]: And the city's like, we don't want it.

2332
03:32:13,748 --> 03:32:16,709
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not up to, you need to bring it up to the standards.

2333
03:32:16,749 --> 03:32:20,210
[SPEAKER_32]: You need to put in sidewalks and the curbing and all of that.

2334
03:32:20,790 --> 03:32:22,311
[SPEAKER_32]: And then none of that was ever done.

2335
03:32:22,511 --> 03:32:30,373
[SPEAKER_32]: So unless there is any evidence showing it was accepted, that was the term he used, derelict private way.

2336
03:32:32,834 --> 03:32:35,955
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter, did you have any insight there while we're on this issue?

2337
03:32:39,451 --> 03:32:44,273
[SPEAKER_20]: And just to be clear, what impact does this have either way?

2338
03:32:45,453 --> 03:32:46,954
[SPEAKER_20]: It's part of enforcement.

2339
03:32:47,074 --> 03:32:48,535
[SPEAKER_20]: It's sidewalks.

2340
03:32:49,375 --> 03:32:54,918
[SPEAKER_10]: In my understanding, the only thing that it affects is one of Director Blake's preferred conditions.

2341
03:32:55,818 --> 03:33:01,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, it'll be he wrote it into the condition because I think at the time it was still on the shore.

2342
03:33:01,541 --> 03:33:04,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just the kind of thing where his recommendation

2343
03:33:05,436 --> 03:33:09,359
[SPEAKER_10]: His recommendation for a condition would be one thing if it was a private way and one thing if it was a public way.

2344
03:33:11,080 --> 03:33:15,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that's the only impact on the decision as it stands.

2345
03:33:15,943 --> 03:33:22,648
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just one of the conditions will change whether or not it's a private or public way.

2346
03:33:24,689 --> 03:33:27,251
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe that's someone related to the Fulton Street sidewalk.

2347
03:33:28,231 --> 03:33:28,391
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2348
03:33:28,992 --> 03:33:29,112
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2349
03:33:42,776 --> 03:33:46,658
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, I'm sorry, Ari, did you have a second topic there?

2350
03:33:46,678 --> 03:33:49,240
[SPEAKER_20]: I know one was the public-private.

2351
03:33:49,260 --> 03:33:51,361
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like you had another one.

2352
03:33:51,942 --> 03:33:56,364
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I was hoping to hear information from Attorney Stein.

2353
03:33:57,785 --> 03:33:58,105
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2354
03:34:00,667 --> 03:34:06,631
[SPEAKER_22]: Sure, so again, when you read 48th and Lane, it talks about the youth being protected.

2355
03:34:06,811 --> 03:34:08,452
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the use of the property

2356
03:34:09,992 --> 03:34:15,037
[SPEAKER_22]: by a nonprofit for an educational purpose on land they either own or lease.

2357
03:34:15,538 --> 03:34:18,361
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's certainly the nonprofit can be leasing the land.

2358
03:34:19,322 --> 03:34:28,111
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that the Sullivan case that Attorney Racer is relying on is procedurally different in addition to the comments that Attorney Ross had.

2359
03:34:28,591 --> 03:34:31,154
[SPEAKER_22]: So that case was actually a building permit appeal.

2360
03:34:31,434 --> 03:34:32,855
[SPEAKER_22]: It didn't involve a site plan appeal.

2361
03:34:33,796 --> 03:34:42,062
[SPEAKER_22]: And ultimately, it's my opinion that the operator of the use needs to be the nonprofit and they need to have education as a bona fide purpose.

2362
03:34:42,723 --> 03:34:52,449
[SPEAKER_22]: I personally don't see an issue with the site plan applicant being the landlord or the operator or both.

2363
03:34:52,470 --> 03:35:01,296
[SPEAKER_22]: I think ultimately the important thing is that when the use is being conducted on the property, the use is being conducted by the educational nonprofit,

2364
03:35:04,825 --> 03:35:05,606
[SPEAKER_22]: on land that they own.

2365
03:35:07,126 --> 03:35:07,966
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, Attorney Stein.

2366
03:35:07,986 --> 03:35:09,767
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think this case is distinguishable.

2367
03:35:10,247 --> 03:35:11,487
[SPEAKER_20]: Was that just me or was that?

2368
03:35:11,507 --> 03:35:13,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, I think the situation.

2369
03:35:13,228 --> 03:35:13,828
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2370
03:35:14,108 --> 03:35:14,968
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, can you hear me now?

2371
03:35:15,408 --> 03:35:15,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2372
03:35:16,169 --> 03:35:22,631
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think my understanding of this application is that ultimately, Halo House is going to be the sole operator of the

2373
03:35:24,153 --> 03:35:25,514
[SPEAKER_22]: of the business, they're it.

2374
03:35:26,214 --> 03:35:35,098
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not a situation where it's being operated in part by the landlord, the landlord's the landlord, and they're allowed to lease to a nonprofit, and a nonprofit can benefit from the statutory protections.

2375
03:35:38,879 --> 03:35:42,060
[SPEAKER_22]: So I hope that helps clarify the issue.

2376
03:35:43,901 --> 03:35:44,682
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you think, Ari?

2377
03:35:47,283 --> 03:35:47,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2378
03:35:48,003 --> 03:35:48,183
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2379
03:35:48,503 --> 03:35:50,524
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

2380
03:35:50,564 --> 03:35:52,225
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter, I see your hand is still raised.

2381
03:35:53,662 --> 03:35:55,583
[SPEAKER_20]: Any other questions, comments?

2382
03:35:56,363 --> 03:35:57,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I had a second comment.

2383
03:35:58,004 --> 03:36:01,445
[SPEAKER_10]: It was something related to one of the public comments.

2384
03:36:01,465 --> 03:36:14,311
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was something that is kind of a procedural matter that members of this board might be used to and might not think of that Attorney Ross brought up in his summation as well.

2385
03:36:14,331 --> 03:36:18,152
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to speak to the kind of,

2386
03:36:20,800 --> 03:36:25,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's something I've seen a couple of times, both tonight and other meetings, being misunderstood.

2387
03:36:25,403 --> 03:36:37,092
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to make this perfectly clear for the public that when a site plan approval is issued for this project, should it be issued, it will be issued for this use.

2388
03:36:37,752 --> 03:36:44,477
[SPEAKER_10]: There is not some kind of shell game where we're going to approve a domestic violence shelter and something else is going to pop up.

2389
03:36:44,517 --> 03:36:46,478
[SPEAKER_10]: This is approved for this use.

2390
03:36:46,518 --> 03:36:48,820
[SPEAKER_10]: And if someone tries to use this approval

2391
03:36:49,828 --> 03:36:57,372
[SPEAKER_10]: this prospective approval, sorry, to build something else that will not hold because that is not the purpose of the permit.

2392
03:36:57,432 --> 03:36:59,774
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just, that is my only comment.

2393
03:36:59,914 --> 03:37:00,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2394
03:37:01,155 --> 03:37:02,195
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, well said, Peter.

2395
03:37:02,215 --> 03:37:14,422
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, if this flips into condos or Airbnbs or what have you, you're out in more technical terms, I guess.

2396
03:37:15,503 --> 03:37:17,784
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, it's very important to state that for sure.

2397
03:37:20,292 --> 03:37:24,053
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep, I mean, I think most of my questions and comments have been addressed.

2398
03:37:24,373 --> 03:37:31,114
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, we talked about parking, a lot of questions around use, you know, if not HALO, what?

2399
03:37:31,655 --> 03:37:37,516
[SPEAKER_20]: It has to be some form of educational or religious use.

2400
03:37:38,536 --> 03:37:40,877
[SPEAKER_20]: I have no doubt that this qualifies under the Dover Amendment.

2401
03:37:42,837 --> 03:37:46,138
[SPEAKER_20]: And then in terms of reasonable regulations,

2402
03:37:47,970 --> 03:37:50,392
[SPEAKER_20]: which is specifically for the parking requirements.

2403
03:37:51,432 --> 03:37:56,795
[SPEAKER_20]: That is the regulation that the applicant is requesting relief from.

2404
03:37:56,815 --> 03:38:03,899
[SPEAKER_20]: I think their plan for a shuttle service is reasonable.

2405
03:38:03,920 --> 03:38:07,261
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there's other conditions that we can put in there.

2406
03:38:07,281 --> 03:38:16,547
[SPEAKER_20]: At this point, I'd love to

2407
03:38:18,844 --> 03:38:41,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair Hedman, I just had a thought as I was reading through the conditions, and there's another thing I wanted to bring up regarding, because I know some people have been concerned about the condition, the residents will not be eligible for City of Medford on-street resident parking permits, and what that, to some people, implied about parking, potential parking capacity and parking demand.

2408
03:38:42,000 --> 03:38:45,843
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to say just based on previous projects I've worked on and other

2409
03:38:47,348 --> 03:39:07,238
[SPEAKER_10]: as part of this board and previous projects I've worked on professionally with those kind of developments, that is a kind of preventative boilerplate that goes in anything that gets tossed in as a condition for anything vaguely residential to prevent anything.

2410
03:39:07,258 --> 03:39:14,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not to be indicative of potential for a ton of parking happening here, despite what

2411
03:39:15,611 --> 03:39:38,597
[SPEAKER_10]: the applicant says i would much i would on this in this regard tend towards the applicants estimates of parking knowing uh what i know yeah i agree um okay so are there any additional comments from the board and i would remind um

2412
03:39:39,867 --> 03:39:44,315
[SPEAKER_20]: all members or all attendees of this meeting to not use the meeting chat.

2413
03:39:44,595 --> 03:39:52,189
[SPEAKER_20]: That is not part of public record and is not the way to do things.

2414
03:39:55,990 --> 03:40:04,775
[SPEAKER_20]: So the two questions, just to like really, really kind of hammer it home, the two questions before the board, does this qualify as a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment?

2415
03:40:05,816 --> 03:40:09,639
[SPEAKER_20]: Legal counsel asserts that yes, it's a protected educational use.

2416
03:40:09,799 --> 03:40:10,599
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree with this.

2417
03:40:12,720 --> 03:40:19,365
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment as it's a non-profit educational entity leasing the property.

2418
03:40:19,385 --> 03:40:24,728
[SPEAKER_20]: A for-profit owner, SEC Holdings, does not impact this protected status.

2419
03:40:27,182 --> 03:40:32,225
[SPEAKER_20]: The second question is, what are reasonable regulations that should be imposed on the use?

2420
03:40:33,365 --> 03:40:43,991
[SPEAKER_20]: And the focus here is on relief from strict adherence to the zoning ordinance for parking requirements, specifically the number of spaces and modifications to the non-conforming structure.

2421
03:40:46,992 --> 03:40:50,894
[SPEAKER_20]: We're trying to see, is there a municipal interest in imposing these requirements?

2422
03:40:52,790 --> 03:41:01,962
[SPEAKER_20]: Or are there conditions that we can impose on the applicant that kind of satisfy us if they're asking for this exemption?

2423
03:41:01,982 --> 03:41:06,749
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this time, Danielle, would you be able to bring up the conditions document?

2424
03:41:27,223 --> 03:41:27,563
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2425
03:41:27,623 --> 03:41:29,224
[SPEAKER_25]: Did that?

2426
03:41:29,464 --> 03:41:31,944
[SPEAKER_20]: A little bit, a little bigger.

2427
03:41:31,964 --> 03:41:33,485
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2428
03:41:39,326 --> 03:41:46,349
[SPEAKER_20]: Would the board like to go through every condition or there are specific conditions we would like to touch on?

2429
03:41:46,769 --> 03:41:50,290
[SPEAKER_20]: I know we've talked about lease, we've talked about parking.

2430
03:41:53,131 --> 03:42:20,605
[SPEAKER_20]: um transit management i think there could potentially be some improvements to where is it there could potentially be some improvements to the traffic and transportation condition section um based on what we've talked about maybe the inclusion of specific language around a transit management uh plan i mean i think the the shuttle

2431
03:42:21,655 --> 03:42:24,578
[SPEAKER_10]: What I was referring to was the shuttle service.

2432
03:42:25,358 --> 03:42:28,261
[SPEAKER_10]: The shuttle service was what I was referring to.

2433
03:42:28,281 --> 03:42:29,762
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so that's adequate.

2434
03:42:30,462 --> 03:42:32,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, if that's conditioned on the permit, they have to do it, so.

2435
03:42:33,805 --> 03:42:34,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2436
03:42:35,747 --> 03:42:36,047
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2437
03:42:37,068 --> 03:42:47,357
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we have condition number five, which is prior to issuance of a building permit, Halo House must provide evidence of a long-term lease.

2438
03:42:47,377 --> 03:42:48,698
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the five plus five.

2439
03:42:51,265 --> 03:42:57,808
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe, yeah, and they have already provided a lease, but we wanted to have this in the conditions as well.

2440
03:42:59,069 --> 03:43:12,374
[SPEAKER_20]: Right above that, Condition 4, this explicitly states that it's conditioned on the use of the property being for an educational use, protected and exempted by the Dover Amendment.

2441
03:43:12,995 --> 03:43:18,077
[SPEAKER_20]: Should the property cease to be used for this use, the property in the use shall

2442
03:43:19,415 --> 03:43:22,358
[SPEAKER_20]: conform to the then application requirements of the zoning ordinance.

2443
03:43:22,498 --> 03:43:25,640
[SPEAKER_20]: So they'd have to make some changes.

2444
03:43:30,865 --> 03:43:34,969
[SPEAKER_20]: We have some information from the engineering team plan showing that St.

2445
03:43:34,989 --> 03:43:36,390
[SPEAKER_20]: Clair Road is a public way.

2446
03:43:37,431 --> 03:43:40,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Engineering division does not have any acceptance plans.

2447
03:43:41,354 --> 03:43:44,957
[SPEAKER_20]: So the plans must be updated to indicate that St.

2448
03:43:44,977 --> 03:43:46,739
[SPEAKER_20]: Clair Road is not a public way.

2449
03:43:48,537 --> 03:43:51,158
[SPEAKER_20]: unless we have documentation stating otherwise.

2450
03:43:51,178 --> 03:43:56,519
[SPEAKER_10]: If we don't, I believe that was the whole derelict public way discussion.

2451
03:43:57,039 --> 03:43:57,339
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2452
03:43:59,200 --> 03:44:00,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Or derelict private way.

2453
03:44:01,080 --> 03:44:01,740
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2454
03:44:01,881 --> 03:44:09,803
[SPEAKER_20]: You also have condition 10, which has the applicant providing for improved pedestrian access from the site to Fulton Street.

2455
03:44:10,503 --> 03:44:14,644
[SPEAKER_20]: So that extends from their site

2456
03:44:15,753 --> 03:44:24,458
[SPEAKER_20]: all the way to Fulton Street so that patrons of the 100 bus have safe access.

2457
03:44:24,478 --> 03:44:29,501
[SPEAKER_19]: You have the wheelchair?

2458
03:44:30,521 --> 03:44:31,122
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Peter?

2459
03:44:31,642 --> 03:44:31,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2460
03:44:34,218 --> 03:44:45,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Not to speak for Todd, but I believe this was the included condition for it being a private way because if it was a public way, we could condition for sidewalk on St.

2461
03:44:45,121 --> 03:44:45,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Clair Road.

2462
03:44:45,541 --> 03:44:50,183
[SPEAKER_10]: But if it's a private way, can't condition that because the city doesn't control it.

2463
03:44:53,224 --> 03:44:59,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, and I think that condition does provide the flexibility there with other treatments considered and approved.

2464
03:45:00,996 --> 03:45:02,957
[SPEAKER_20]: by the Director of Traffic and Transportation?

2465
03:45:02,977 --> 03:45:04,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Or do you propose?

2466
03:45:04,378 --> 03:45:08,841
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that flexibility isn't there.

2467
03:45:08,861 --> 03:45:15,526
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I prefer honestly to give that flexibility to Todd to see what the conditions are.

2468
03:45:16,126 --> 03:45:16,346
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2469
03:45:17,487 --> 03:45:17,667
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2470
03:45:26,793 --> 03:45:29,775
[SPEAKER_20]: Are there any other conditions that the board would like to review?

2471
03:45:46,734 --> 03:45:46,994
[SPEAKER_20]: Ben.

2472
03:45:49,636 --> 03:45:50,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

2473
03:45:50,797 --> 03:46:08,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I feel like a bit of a broken record on this, but I have significant concerns around, and I appreciate Peter's expertise in this area, which I certainly don't have, but the traffic, as many residents identified, the traffic in the area is awful.

2474
03:46:09,211 --> 03:46:10,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Parking is awful.

2475
03:46:11,486 --> 03:46:23,288
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a real unique lack of parking on that particular street, which it sounds like we're not even sure at this point, or I guess it's a derelict private way.

2476
03:46:23,368 --> 03:46:25,108
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sort of where we are right now.

2477
03:46:25,969 --> 03:46:36,270
[SPEAKER_13]: But the condition as worded around shuttle transportation is just very open-ended and broad, and I think

2478
03:46:40,188 --> 03:47:03,233
[SPEAKER_13]: making an assumption that domestic violence victims don't have automobiles, um, that there won't be a dramatic increase in ride share traffic, for example, um, by adding this many families to the neighborhood, uh, especially if there are, you know, if they're required to not have vehicles in the, in the neighborhood.

2479
03:47:03,253 --> 03:47:06,094
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, I personally am not comfortable with

2480
03:47:07,540 --> 03:47:16,249
[SPEAKER_13]: the conditions as worded that there won't be a significant degradation of a neighborhood's traffic and parking situation that's already in pretty rough shape.

2481
03:47:17,870 --> 03:47:18,491
[SPEAKER_20]: I hear you.

2482
03:47:19,352 --> 03:47:28,140
[SPEAKER_20]: So thinking about the specific relief that the applicant is asking for, it's around parking requirements.

2483
03:47:28,240 --> 03:47:29,601
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not around traffic.

2484
03:47:31,990 --> 03:47:33,852
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm trying to think of potential things we could do.

2485
03:47:34,232 --> 03:47:44,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't know if there's a condition to... Find a way to add parking somehow.

2486
03:47:44,661 --> 03:47:48,224
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't even know if we're allowed to do this because we would be...

2487
03:47:50,498 --> 03:47:56,060
[SPEAKER_20]: In one case, we would be getting involved in a private lease, and I think that's way beyond our scope.

2488
03:47:56,120 --> 03:48:16,885
[SPEAKER_20]: But I did write down the idea that potentially the lease could state that no parking is allowed by lessee's occupants, and or there is some condition to maintain off-street spaces for lessee's employees, landowner, or their representatives.

2489
03:48:20,492 --> 03:48:21,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, something like that could work.

2490
03:48:21,873 --> 03:48:34,942
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'm curious, you know, again, getting into the weeds here, but what's the definition of parking is a perpetual stream of ride share, temporary stops, is that considered parking?

2491
03:48:35,883 --> 03:48:36,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?

2492
03:48:38,153 --> 03:48:47,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is that just a traffic enforcement issue which adds additional burden to the city and our police department, potentially?

2493
03:48:49,096 --> 03:48:54,678
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were just told that it's not even confirmed that this is even a public way, right?

2494
03:48:54,718 --> 03:48:55,598
[SPEAKER_13]: So who enforces?

2495
03:48:56,018 --> 03:48:56,799
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, I don't know.

2496
03:48:56,999 --> 03:49:02,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I have major concerns around traffic parking enforcement.

2497
03:49:02,840 --> 03:49:06,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I realize that we need to be specific as to what conditions we would add.

2498
03:49:08,677 --> 03:49:18,526
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a long meeting and I don't, I don't have anything, you know, I don't have a bright idea to resolve it right at this moment, but I'm thinking about it.

2499
03:49:19,387 --> 03:49:24,691
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm wondering if the applicant has any, um, any reactions to.

2500
03:49:27,273 --> 03:49:32,897
[SPEAKER_20]: to some of these comments or any kind of potential modifications that they'd be open to.

2501
03:49:32,977 --> 03:49:48,549
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, the lease stating that no parking is allowed by lessee's occupants, you know, you've said yourselves that you're starting to achieve an agreement for two off-street spaces.

2502
03:49:51,992 --> 03:49:52,632
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I'm not.

2503
03:49:52,672 --> 03:49:54,714
[SPEAKER_20]: Could that be like an evergreen thing?

2504
03:49:54,814 --> 03:49:57,535
[SPEAKER_20]: If you know if those two aren't available, you find two somewhere else.

2505
03:49:58,676 --> 03:50:00,157
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, I mean, I hate to put a condition.

2506
03:50:00,357 --> 03:50:07,201
[SPEAKER_40]: You know, you kind of put a gun to your head to invite someone to say, well, now now you really need those spaces, don't you?

2507
03:50:07,261 --> 03:50:14,065
[SPEAKER_40]: And then I know, you know, but I look, I wouldn't have raised it if I if I didn't believe it was absolutely going.

2508
03:50:14,465 --> 03:50:18,427
[SPEAKER_40]: If I didn't believe it was going to happen, I would be open to.

2509
03:50:20,128 --> 03:50:25,750
[SPEAKER_40]: uh, commercial reasonable efforts to identify two parking spaces within several hundred feet of the facility.

2510
03:50:25,770 --> 03:50:27,550
[SPEAKER_40]: I would be open to that language.

2511
03:50:27,730 --> 03:50:35,933
[SPEAKER_40]: I would also be open to the language you recommended, and my client is here, so stop, Andrew, if I'm saying something you disagree with.

2512
03:50:36,712 --> 03:50:37,993
[SPEAKER_40]: um, and, uh, Taisha.

2513
03:50:38,433 --> 03:50:43,276
[SPEAKER_40]: But I think I would also be okay with some language about not parking.

2514
03:50:43,656 --> 03:50:51,501
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, are the guests of the facility would not be allowed to park within the, would not be allowed to bring their automobiles to the facility.

2515
03:50:52,261 --> 03:51:00,986
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, and again, on both those points, unless there's any issue from Taisha or from Andrew to raise their hand, I think we would go along with that.

2516
03:51:01,006 --> 03:51:03,628
[SPEAKER_40]: And that would not give everything that, um,

2517
03:51:05,035 --> 03:51:23,533
[SPEAKER_40]: member Ben was raising but you know you have to I mean I'm very confident that as compared to that condominium building that's on the corner of the building that by comparison there won't be a fraction as much of as these you know ride share delivery type entities.

2518
03:51:23,673 --> 03:51:27,057
[SPEAKER_40]: A lot of these women from everything I've learned from Taisha

2519
03:51:27,697 --> 03:51:41,072
[SPEAKER_40]: is that you know they have a kitchen of commercial kitchen on site you know funds are given the state of where they are in their life right now funds are not diverted towards the resources of

2520
03:51:42,798 --> 03:51:47,619
[SPEAKER_40]: and if you will, it's a very, it's a much more limited budget.

2521
03:51:48,079 --> 03:51:50,380
[SPEAKER_40]: And so you're not gonna see that level of activity.

2522
03:51:50,420 --> 03:51:58,882
[SPEAKER_40]: Again, that condominium building to our right would, I would dare say, would have substantially more than what we're seeing.

2523
03:51:59,502 --> 03:52:02,423
[SPEAKER_40]: But I think your concerns are valid.

2524
03:52:02,523 --> 03:52:08,225
[SPEAKER_40]: And to that end, we would add, we would be amenable to those two additions.

2525
03:52:11,618 --> 03:52:13,739
[SPEAKER_40]: and they go directly to the issue of transportation.

2526
03:52:13,759 --> 03:52:19,303
[SPEAKER_40]: I think I appreciate, Madam Chair, your ideas on that.

2527
03:52:19,343 --> 03:52:21,164
[SPEAKER_40]: I think they're good.

2528
03:52:22,765 --> 03:52:23,606
[SPEAKER_20]: Every once in a while.

2529
03:52:25,968 --> 03:52:26,908
[SPEAKER_20]: What do we think, squad?

2530
03:52:26,928 --> 03:52:35,594
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, Peter, from a transportation perspective, do you anticipate any issues?

2531
03:52:35,674 --> 03:52:37,035
[SPEAKER_20]: Are these things you've seen before?

2532
03:52:37,055 --> 03:52:39,717
[SPEAKER_20]: Should we start wordsmithing?

2533
03:52:41,048 --> 03:52:51,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I think those two conditions, as suggested, are valid.

2534
03:52:55,000 --> 03:53:09,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they would thus be, and let me write this down, described as the applicant, or would it be the applicant or the applicant's lessees in this case?

2535
03:53:10,785 --> 03:53:19,567
[SPEAKER_20]: I would want to kind of future proof it so that it is, yeah, that's interesting.

2536
03:53:21,748 --> 03:53:24,109
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll put both, applicant or the applicant's lessees.

2537
03:53:24,269 --> 03:53:24,569
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2538
03:53:26,749 --> 03:53:26,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2539
03:53:29,390 --> 03:53:39,133
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wanted to specifically be towards the occupants because I'm recognizing that the employees, landowners, or their representatives would

2540
03:53:41,615 --> 03:54:10,825
[SPEAKER_10]: um be addressed and then maintain off-street spaces or make all commercially viable efforts um okay so the applicant or the applicants policies shall make all commercially viable efforts to maintain two off-streets let's say at least to make all commercially viable efforts to maintain a minimum of two

2541
03:54:13,191 --> 03:54:24,895
[SPEAKER_10]: two parking spaces for used by staff, landowners, or lessees.

2542
03:54:26,275 --> 03:54:33,758
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what was the second one about the, what's it called, the residents?

2543
03:54:33,818 --> 03:54:34,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is that already covered?

2544
03:54:37,580 --> 03:54:39,920
[SPEAKER_20]: Lease states that no parking is allowed by the lessee.

2545
03:54:40,001 --> 03:54:40,781
[SPEAKER_20]: That's my understanding.

2546
03:54:41,702 --> 03:54:43,423
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's 33 p.m.

2547
03:54:44,063 --> 03:54:44,844
[SPEAKER_20]: phrasing of it.

2548
03:54:45,464 --> 03:54:45,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2549
03:54:45,924 --> 03:54:49,686
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I believe the.

2550
03:54:49,726 --> 03:54:56,890
[SPEAKER_10]: We shall state that no parking, no vehicle parking, no motor vehicle parking shall be allowed by.

2551
03:55:00,512 --> 03:55:04,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Occupants of the lessees use.

2552
03:55:06,196 --> 03:55:06,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Something to that effect.

2553
03:55:07,336 --> 03:55:07,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2554
03:55:10,078 --> 03:55:10,338
[SPEAKER_10]: And then.

2555
03:55:11,243 --> 03:55:32,349
[SPEAKER_10]: The one thing, the one comment I will make in terms of the ride share is it goes kind of back to what I was saying, especially as this will be, as I think that was more a concern regarding the residents as opposed to staff and employees.

2556
03:55:32,709 --> 03:55:38,771
[SPEAKER_10]: And that goes back to the comment I had about these kind of uses being kind of a very controlled system.

2557
03:55:42,226 --> 03:55:48,910
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of be arriving not kind of in the middle of nowhere, out of nowhere.

2558
03:55:48,970 --> 03:55:52,413
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be a system for that.

2559
03:55:52,573 --> 03:55:54,714
[SPEAKER_10]: And there will be a kind of intake process.

2560
03:55:54,774 --> 03:56:01,499
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but there will be a ton of people just like rolling up whenever.

2561
03:56:01,519 --> 03:56:10,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think that's part of what Attorney Ross alluded to with the shuttle system to take people to kind of shopping areas and commercial areas that people will be kind of

2562
03:56:12,053 --> 03:56:16,216
[SPEAKER_10]: that that will be organized and not haphazard, I would hope.

2563
03:56:16,897 --> 03:56:17,077
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2564
03:56:17,137 --> 03:56:21,881
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't want to make any hypotheses about the client's arrival.

2565
03:56:22,101 --> 03:56:27,145
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, if they had it their way, they'd probably not be in this situation to begin with and never arrive.

2566
03:56:27,165 --> 03:56:28,466
[SPEAKER_20]: That's fair.

2567
03:56:28,646 --> 03:56:35,051
[SPEAKER_20]: But in terms of coming and going post intake, I think the shuttle addresses that.

2568
03:56:35,111 --> 03:56:35,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2569
03:56:39,259 --> 03:57:06,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, if I may, with all due respect, we just, we just conditioned Tufts to have dedicated spots for ride share and delivery for college students who are not allowed to have Medford resident parking and, you know, are not allowed to park on the streets, but we're not going, I realize it's a smaller scale development, but we're making assumptions about these people's behavior.

2570
03:57:07,910 --> 03:57:23,732
[SPEAKER_13]: that I don't think is really, like, what is the difference between a college student living in a dorm and a family who is going through a tough time and needs temporary

2571
03:57:24,926 --> 03:57:30,152
[SPEAKER_13]: shelter, but might have, you know, there might be people that need to get to work, right?

2572
03:57:30,192 --> 03:57:38,021
[SPEAKER_13]: There might be people, there might be, you know, working age minors who are living in this situation who still need to get to their job.

2573
03:57:38,302 --> 03:57:42,887
[SPEAKER_13]: And like, this is just a very broadly worded shuttle option.

2574
03:57:42,907 --> 03:57:43,988
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um,

2575
03:57:45,848 --> 03:57:50,050
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't, I don't know, I'm very sympathetic to the resident who is the immediate abutter.

2576
03:57:51,730 --> 03:58:06,356
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, on a derelict private way that could theoretically have a high volume of ride share, whether you call that parking or just pulling over, I don't really know how parking is defined in this case, but, you know, could be a pretty steady stream of

2577
03:58:08,517 --> 03:58:15,441
[SPEAKER_13]: short-term stops and pickups and drop-offs, and we have no conditions to sort of handle that situation.

2578
03:58:15,561 --> 03:58:21,304
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not even clear, frankly, who would enforce it, because it's not clear that it's even a city of Medford Street.

2579
03:58:21,384 --> 03:58:23,024
[SPEAKER_20]: I hear what you're saying, Ben.

2580
03:58:23,545 --> 03:58:25,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm just struggling with that issue.

2581
03:58:25,546 --> 03:58:28,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very sympathetic to the residential concerns of the neighbors.

2582
03:58:29,027 --> 03:58:29,808
[SPEAKER_13]: No, totally.

2583
03:58:30,408 --> 03:58:34,350
[SPEAKER_20]: And I guess my question for you is, what conditions could we put in there?

2584
03:58:36,891 --> 03:58:38,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've been struggling with that.

2585
03:58:38,974 --> 03:58:46,045
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to figure something out because I think in an ideal world where St.

2586
03:58:46,085 --> 03:58:50,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Clair Road was a public way we could condition pickup drop-offs,

2587
03:58:51,788 --> 03:58:52,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Area on st.

2588
03:58:52,789 --> 03:58:55,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Clair road, but unfortunately it's not so we can't do that.

2589
03:58:55,811 --> 03:58:56,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2590
03:58:56,771 --> 03:58:57,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2591
03:58:57,852 --> 03:58:58,352
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's okay.

2592
03:58:58,392 --> 03:59:04,917
[SPEAKER_20]: If you say, like, no condition would satisfy that that's that's totally valid, but I'm just trying to get.

2593
03:59:05,637 --> 03:59:09,440
[SPEAKER_20]: To see, like, is there an integrative solution that we can apply that.

2594
03:59:11,481 --> 03:59:15,524
[SPEAKER_20]: could start to address this concern over parking slash traffic.

2595
03:59:16,025 --> 03:59:22,230
[SPEAKER_20]: And I get the kind of subtle nuance between the two, because how long does a car have to sit there to be parking?

2596
03:59:22,250 --> 03:59:38,162
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, I mean, if there's not a proposal for a precondition, then you're well within your responsibilities and your rights as a board member to not

2597
03:59:40,948 --> 03:59:45,309
[SPEAKER_20]: to feel like there are no reasonable regulations that could be imposed to solve this issue.

2598
03:59:45,329 --> 03:59:48,410
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks.

2599
03:59:49,930 --> 03:59:50,150
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2600
03:59:51,070 --> 03:59:51,931
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie, I see your hand.

2601
03:59:56,412 --> 04:00:00,132
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't see what we could put in there, just like you were saying.

2602
04:00:00,292 --> 04:00:08,154
[SPEAKER_31]: It's such a, it's a tough thing to put in for a private way.

2603
04:00:09,330 --> 04:00:16,697
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's just going to be the facility managing coming and going.

2604
04:00:16,838 --> 04:00:22,003
[SPEAKER_31]: But I honestly can't see how to put a different language in.

2605
04:00:22,023 --> 04:00:24,285
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2606
04:00:29,991 --> 04:00:30,071
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

2607
04:00:31,682 --> 04:00:31,942
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

2608
04:00:32,082 --> 04:00:32,322
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2609
04:00:32,543 --> 04:00:32,843
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2610
04:00:32,963 --> 04:00:33,823
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

2611
04:00:33,843 --> 04:00:51,374
[SPEAKER_21]: I do think that there is a substantial difference in the particularly food delivery norms of like college students and people who are by definition experiencing a very difficult period in their life.

2612
04:00:52,095 --> 04:01:00,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, and in terms of the like financial amount of door dashing a single coffee, um, I don't,

2613
04:01:01,685 --> 04:01:04,306
[SPEAKER_21]: That doesn't negate the parking issue.

2614
04:01:04,366 --> 04:01:17,013
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that I am very open to kind of continuing towards Smith ways to kind of control the traffic, but I do think that.

2615
04:01:17,033 --> 04:01:24,257
[SPEAKER_20]: I just don't think we have the jurisdiction to control traffic on what we understand to be a private way.

2616
04:01:25,433 --> 04:01:28,055
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, that's what we're going to keep hitting that again and again.

2617
04:01:28,075 --> 04:01:37,503
[SPEAKER_20]: And even if it was a public way, if we apply the same logic that we applied to the tough storm, which is what, 600?

2618
04:01:38,424 --> 04:01:39,565
[SPEAKER_20]: How many students is it? 677.

2619
04:01:43,797 --> 04:01:46,078
[SPEAKER_20]: 677, so we have four spots for 677.

2620
04:01:46,138 --> 04:01:47,818
[SPEAKER_20]: 677 divided by four.

2621
04:01:47,838 --> 04:01:51,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it'd be like less than one.

2622
04:01:51,579 --> 04:01:54,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it'd be like a tire.

2623
04:01:54,220 --> 04:01:58,701
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know we can't do that in math one-to-one, but I'm just trying to think.

2624
04:02:00,881 --> 04:02:02,982
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, that's assuming it's a public way, which it's not.

2625
04:02:04,721 --> 04:02:07,442
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a private way, unless there's documentation otherwise.

2626
04:02:07,522 --> 04:02:12,083
[SPEAKER_20]: So we could put conditions in that say, if St.

2627
04:02:12,123 --> 04:02:20,164
[SPEAKER_20]: Clair Road is designated as a public way, then we would like at least one 15-minute pickup drop-off spot.

2628
04:02:21,025 --> 04:02:23,865
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that we have an applicant.

2629
04:02:23,885 --> 04:02:25,506
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably the closest we're going to get jurisdictionally.

2630
04:02:25,526 --> 04:02:27,766
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the closest we're going to get, I think, at this point.

2631
04:02:28,206 --> 04:02:30,647
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the same as the sidewalk condition.

2632
04:02:33,186 --> 04:02:34,827
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it all hinges on this.

2633
04:02:35,287 --> 04:02:39,430
[SPEAKER_20]: And Ari, kudos to you for bringing up this question, the public-private way question.

2634
04:02:40,871 --> 04:02:42,992
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't know if there's any thoughts on that.

2635
04:02:43,593 --> 04:02:48,456
[SPEAKER_20]: If public, then 15-minute, one 15-minute spot.

2636
04:02:52,358 --> 04:02:52,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

2637
04:02:53,239 --> 04:02:54,219
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds good.

2638
04:02:54,319 --> 04:02:57,982
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't want you to feel pressured into this, because I'm not.

2639
04:02:58,262 --> 04:02:58,802
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not.

2640
04:03:00,606 --> 04:03:02,788
[SPEAKER_13]: I recognize the constraints we're dealing with.

2641
04:03:02,828 --> 04:03:03,128
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2642
04:03:03,148 --> 04:03:06,510
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like we're going to have some laws changed after this.

2643
04:03:08,831 --> 04:03:09,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, man.

2644
04:03:09,292 --> 04:03:10,012
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2645
04:03:10,572 --> 04:03:18,617
[SPEAKER_20]: So to go back to the conditions, and Annie, I know that you were also concerned about traffic, parking.

2646
04:03:19,218 --> 04:03:21,959
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have any thoughts on an additional condition?

2647
04:03:21,979 --> 04:03:27,983
[SPEAKER_20]: I realize I have to see if the applicant would even be open to this, but just Annie first.

2648
04:03:28,683 --> 04:03:36,306
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, I've driven up there, walked around the neighborhood, looked at it every which way, stood across the street.

2649
04:03:36,926 --> 04:03:37,166
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2650
04:03:37,826 --> 04:03:42,168
[SPEAKER_31]: I just don't see what we can do about a private way.

2651
04:03:42,988 --> 04:03:43,268
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

2652
04:03:44,348 --> 04:03:49,490
[SPEAKER_20]: If it was a public way, would you be open to this 15-minute spot?

2653
04:03:50,070 --> 04:03:50,851
[SPEAKER_31]: Absolutely.

2654
04:03:51,171 --> 04:03:51,871
[SPEAKER_31]: Absolutely.

2655
04:03:52,011 --> 04:03:57,373
[SPEAKER_31]: And I just don't think the conditions of a student at Tufts

2656
04:03:58,296 --> 04:04:05,402
[SPEAKER_31]: in that kind of neighborhood compares to the neighborhood where St.

2657
04:04:05,462 --> 04:04:06,162
[SPEAKER_31]: Clair is.

2658
04:04:06,342 --> 04:04:07,483
[SPEAKER_31]: I think that's also.

2659
04:04:07,503 --> 04:04:14,469
[SPEAKER_20]: And regardless, we don't know the lifestyles of students anymore.

2660
04:04:14,489 --> 04:04:16,150
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm so removed from that.

2661
04:04:16,170 --> 04:04:19,212
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just the traffic and on the street.

2662
04:04:19,372 --> 04:04:25,377
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a different style of, and it's a public way compared to a private way.

2663
04:04:25,897 --> 04:04:26,338
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

2664
04:04:27,720 --> 04:04:29,121
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I see your hand up.

2665
04:04:31,782 --> 04:04:33,863
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, thank you madam chair.

2666
04:04:33,883 --> 04:04:36,544
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, there is a process to become.

2667
04:04:37,584 --> 04:04:41,666
[SPEAKER_32]: Public way, I don't know if there is any appetite for the.

2668
04:04:43,527 --> 04:04:46,928
[SPEAKER_32]: Property owner to, I mean, there'd be betterments.

2669
04:04:49,609 --> 04:04:54,631
[SPEAKER_32]: that could be assessed to bring it up to become a public way that would eliminate some of these issues.

2670
04:04:54,651 --> 04:04:59,973
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know the last time a private way was.

2671
04:05:00,993 --> 04:05:05,595
[SPEAKER_32]: Can that be driven by a single homeowner?

2672
04:05:05,615 --> 04:05:08,956
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, someone just has to pay, right?

2673
04:05:09,517 --> 04:05:09,837
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2674
04:05:11,117 --> 04:05:12,177
[SPEAKER_32]: And then be accepted.

2675
04:05:12,298 --> 04:05:13,918
[SPEAKER_15]: All the owners have to agree.

2676
04:05:13,938 --> 04:05:15,179
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

2677
04:05:15,739 --> 04:05:18,460
[SPEAKER_32]: But why wouldn't you want that, I guess, but if you paid for

2678
04:05:20,727 --> 04:05:21,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2679
04:05:22,048 --> 04:05:22,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2680
04:05:22,508 --> 04:05:27,552
[SPEAKER_32]: But there is a process and it could be looked into by the applicant if they wanted to.

2681
04:05:27,572 --> 04:05:35,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if we were to condition something like that, it would have to be like an applicant shall look into it.

2682
04:05:35,519 --> 04:05:39,061
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we could condition it on them doing it because that would be a process.

2683
04:05:39,102 --> 04:05:40,162
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, no.

2684
04:05:40,202 --> 04:05:40,423
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

2685
04:05:40,463 --> 04:05:41,684
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm not suggesting that.

2686
04:05:41,784 --> 04:05:42,864
[SPEAKER_32]: But yeah.

2687
04:05:43,045 --> 04:05:45,747
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, it's.

2688
04:05:46,945 --> 04:05:52,547
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I mean, maybe down the line, I have no doubt that Halo House is going to be a fabulous neighbor.

2689
04:05:53,207 --> 04:06:00,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe down the line, there's a block party, and everybody comes together and says, yeah, let's turn it into a public way.

2690
04:06:00,450 --> 04:06:10,373
[SPEAKER_20]: But for now, I would say that I'm satisfied, and I hope that other members of the board would be, by adding a condition to the traffic and transportation section to say,

2691
04:06:14,933 --> 04:06:15,113
[SPEAKER_20]: St.

2692
04:06:15,153 --> 04:06:17,035
[SPEAKER_20]: Clair Street, or I'm sorry, if St.

2693
04:06:17,055 --> 04:06:27,144
[SPEAKER_20]: Clair Road is a public way, then the applicant will... What word am I looking for here?

2694
04:06:27,244 --> 04:06:33,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Will establish... The wording I put in to the condition I drafted up is, if St.

2695
04:06:33,489 --> 04:06:41,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Clair Road is found to be a public way, the applicant shall furnish a 15-minute loading zone in front of their property.

2696
04:06:42,137 --> 04:06:42,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2697
04:06:43,807 --> 04:06:44,857
[SPEAKER_20]: Applicant, are you open to that?

2698
04:06:46,975 --> 04:06:50,176
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, no, I think you've all done a really good job of trying to get there.

2699
04:06:50,196 --> 04:06:51,377
[SPEAKER_40]: So we appreciate it.

2700
04:06:51,577 --> 04:06:52,537
[SPEAKER_40]: And we are open to that.

2701
04:06:52,557 --> 04:06:55,038
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm taking a negotiations class right now.

2702
04:06:55,058 --> 04:06:57,339
[SPEAKER_40]: So I'm doing a great job.

2703
04:06:57,999 --> 04:06:58,320
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm sure.

2704
04:06:58,360 --> 04:07:10,284
[SPEAKER_40]: But you know, we're also, you know, open to working with the street to, to, to make it I mean, by putting a sidewalk in front of our facility, we are one step closer to getting there.

2705
04:07:10,304 --> 04:07:14,326
[SPEAKER_40]: I just don't understand why the condo association wasn't required to put an

2706
04:07:14,826 --> 04:07:19,787
[SPEAKER_40]: a sidewalk in front of it's, you know, that's, that's not the topic at hand.

2707
04:07:19,847 --> 04:07:20,587
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll let them lie.

2708
04:07:20,967 --> 04:07:26,768
[SPEAKER_20]: Let them enjoy, you know, their, their, their, okay, okay.

2709
04:07:27,668 --> 04:07:27,969
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2710
04:07:30,169 --> 04:07:32,849
[SPEAKER_20]: So, so Danielle, what do we need to do now?

2711
04:07:32,869 --> 04:07:37,990
[SPEAKER_32]: Sorry, I just want to interject again, there's a hydrant in front of the building.

2712
04:07:38,490 --> 04:07:39,371
[SPEAKER_32]: Is that being moved?

2713
04:07:40,431 --> 04:07:41,211
[SPEAKER_32]: So I don't think you could

2714
04:07:42,565 --> 04:07:43,706
[SPEAKER_20]: Totally.

2715
04:07:43,726 --> 04:07:46,408
[SPEAKER_20]: Within x feet, within 15 feet, within.

2716
04:07:46,428 --> 04:07:49,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we can do within, I would say do within 50 feet.

2717
04:07:50,692 --> 04:07:50,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2718
04:07:50,992 --> 04:07:54,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Within 50 feet of the frontage of the building.

2719
04:07:55,476 --> 04:08:00,180
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all you need to cover that variability.

2720
04:08:01,962 --> 04:08:06,265
[SPEAKER_20]: And just to clarify for any members of the public, that spot would not be exclusive.

2721
04:08:08,279 --> 04:08:16,947
[SPEAKER_20]: That spot would not be exclusive to the applicant, to the applicant's residence.

2722
04:08:17,088 --> 04:08:19,750
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be if that spot is installed.

2723
04:08:19,890 --> 04:08:20,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2724
04:08:20,471 --> 04:08:22,453
[SPEAKER_10]: General 15-minute loading zone for whoever needs it.

2725
04:08:22,473 --> 04:08:22,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2726
04:08:23,794 --> 04:08:23,954
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2727
04:08:25,215 --> 04:08:25,456
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

2728
04:08:26,497 --> 04:08:27,217
[SPEAKER_20]: We're good about that.

2729
04:08:27,598 --> 04:08:27,678
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

2730
04:08:31,870 --> 04:08:35,952
[SPEAKER_20]: So do we, Danielle, do you have the language written there?

2731
04:08:35,972 --> 04:08:38,673
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, Peter, it sounds like you were drafting something up.

2732
04:08:40,374 --> 04:08:41,874
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I'm going to share my screen again.

2733
04:08:41,894 --> 04:08:42,775
[SPEAKER_32]: OK.

2734
04:08:43,255 --> 04:08:44,035
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's see here.

2735
04:08:55,180 --> 04:08:55,701
[SPEAKER_20]: Looks like St.

2736
04:08:55,761 --> 04:08:58,042
[SPEAKER_20]: Clair needs to be up.

2737
04:08:58,262 --> 04:08:58,842
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, there you go.

2738
04:09:00,805 --> 04:09:04,086
[SPEAKER_20]: That is how my Aunt Claire spells it, so it's right in some circles.

2739
04:09:06,527 --> 04:09:06,687
[SPEAKER_20]: St.

2740
04:09:06,727 --> 04:09:07,748
[SPEAKER_20]: Clair Road, yeah.

2741
04:09:07,768 --> 04:09:12,370
[SPEAKER_20]: 15-minute loading zone within 15, yeah.

2742
04:09:12,390 --> 04:09:14,450
[SPEAKER_20]: That looks good to me.

2743
04:09:15,551 --> 04:09:18,452
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it within 50 feet of the building, or is that what you wanted?

2744
04:09:19,518 --> 04:09:19,818
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

2745
04:09:20,399 --> 04:09:22,540
[SPEAKER_32]: What is the rule of carping by a hydrant?

2746
04:09:22,580 --> 04:09:23,660
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it 50 or not 50?

2747
04:09:24,261 --> 04:09:24,781
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

2748
04:09:25,041 --> 04:09:28,323
[SPEAKER_32]: It's either 6 or 20.

2749
04:09:28,863 --> 04:09:31,224
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I said 50, because I knew 50 was more.

2750
04:09:32,245 --> 04:09:33,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever it is, I knew 50 was more.

2751
04:09:35,626 --> 04:09:42,510
[SPEAKER_20]: But that, I think, gives them flexibility to abide by any rules around the hydrant.

2752
04:09:43,772 --> 04:09:50,876
[SPEAKER_20]: and still be within a reasonable distance to the domestic violence facility.

2753
04:09:52,496 --> 04:09:57,419
[SPEAKER_10]: And Danielle, you got the other two, the first two.

2754
04:09:57,759 --> 04:09:58,559
[SPEAKER_10]: We could draft it up.

2755
04:09:58,579 --> 04:09:59,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Just want to make sure that.

2756
04:09:59,340 --> 04:10:01,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I have them down here.

2757
04:10:01,621 --> 04:10:07,904
[SPEAKER_20]: I can, all commercially viable efforts, drop that in there in 24.

2758
04:10:12,499 --> 04:10:22,906
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll commercially buy a bouquet.

2759
04:10:22,926 --> 04:10:25,327
[SPEAKER_20]: I also want you to add in landowners' representatives.

2760
04:10:28,970 --> 04:10:30,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Or actually, let's do... Yeah.

2761
04:10:30,271 --> 04:10:31,872
[SPEAKER_20]: Or representatives.

2762
04:10:41,006 --> 04:10:44,587
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, no, I mean, how I wrote this from Peter put in the chat.

2763
04:10:44,607 --> 04:10:53,429
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm trying to how I put it was how I thought of it was landowner and lessee staff and employees.

2764
04:10:53,789 --> 04:10:58,490
[SPEAKER_10]: So covering representative landowners, representatives of landowner staff.

2765
04:10:58,690 --> 04:10:59,710
[SPEAKER_20]: I see what you're saying.

2766
04:10:59,750 --> 04:11:01,870
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a comma after lessee.

2767
04:11:04,031 --> 04:11:09,052
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it staff and employees of the lessee of both?

2768
04:11:10,040 --> 04:11:13,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Of both, of both the landowner and Lossie.

2769
04:11:14,282 --> 04:11:17,664
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how I was trying to include landowner representatives.

2770
04:11:18,384 --> 04:11:18,565
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2771
04:11:21,946 --> 04:11:22,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2772
04:11:23,567 --> 04:11:31,652
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, is that finalized language?

2773
04:11:34,153 --> 04:11:35,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this finalized language?

2774
04:11:35,594 --> 04:11:37,014
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm a big fan of the Oxford comma.

2775
04:11:37,054 --> 04:11:37,855
[SPEAKER_32]: Is this correct?

2776
04:11:38,885 --> 04:11:39,505
[SPEAKER_32]: always.

2777
04:11:40,106 --> 04:11:40,466
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

2778
04:11:41,146 --> 04:11:41,546
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2779
04:11:42,567 --> 04:11:44,888
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, let's do changes to property owner.

2780
04:11:44,908 --> 04:11:44,988
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2781
04:11:45,848 --> 04:11:46,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2782
04:11:47,369 --> 04:11:47,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2783
04:11:50,475 --> 04:11:52,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm gonna.

2784
04:11:53,057 --> 04:11:56,219
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to get some general feelings of the board.

2785
04:11:57,039 --> 04:11:58,740
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we feel like we're ready to vote?

2786
04:11:59,241 --> 04:12:00,041
[SPEAKER_20]: We've done some.

2787
04:12:00,522 --> 04:12:03,183
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we've done some good work to help address.

2788
04:12:03,223 --> 04:12:03,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm ready.

2789
04:12:04,364 --> 04:12:05,705
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm ready to vote on this.

2790
04:12:05,765 --> 04:12:10,288
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I just as a reminder, please do not message members of the board individually.

2791
04:12:12,781 --> 04:12:16,463
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, it sounds like we as a board are ready to vote.

2792
04:12:16,703 --> 04:12:29,913
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm going to ask for a motion to approve the site plan based on the findings that the use is a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment, and that the proposed parking relief is reasonable subject to the conditions.

2793
04:12:31,374 --> 04:12:31,774
[SPEAKER_10]: So moved.

2794
04:12:32,795 --> 04:12:33,716
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm looking for a second.

2795
04:12:34,816 --> 04:12:35,697
[SPEAKER_20]: I will second it.

2796
04:12:36,337 --> 04:12:37,238
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2797
04:12:38,979 --> 04:12:39,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks, Ari.

2798
04:12:39,980 --> 04:12:41,221
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going to do a roll call vote.

2799
04:12:44,287 --> 04:12:44,848
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter coughs.

2800
04:12:45,929 --> 04:12:46,049
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi.

2801
04:12:47,610 --> 04:12:48,171

04:13:02,324 --> 04:13:06,628
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

04:13:08,277 --> 04:13:08,557
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2811
04:13:08,577 --> 04:13:09,978
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you to the applicant.

2812
04:13:09,998 --> 04:13:11,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you to the members of the public.

2813
04:13:12,719 --> 04:13:26,687
[SPEAKER_20]: This has been a very collaborative process and we really appreciate, you know, people advocating for their community and, you know, encourage your public participation in the future.

2814
04:13:27,607 --> 04:13:27,927
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2815
04:13:27,947 --> 04:13:28,848
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2816
04:13:31,969 --> 04:13:34,951
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we need a quick break or are we ready to go into the next item?

2817
04:13:38,550 --> 04:13:39,110
[SPEAKER_31]: Ready to go.

2818
04:13:39,990 --> 04:13:40,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Power through.

2819
04:13:41,111 --> 04:13:41,371
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2820
04:13:41,931 --> 04:13:45,652
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll just step away then because I didn't take a break last time.

2821
04:13:47,972 --> 04:13:54,774
[SPEAKER_22]: Emily, I don't thank you for anything else tonight, so I'm going to take my leave, but good luck with the rest of your meeting.

2822
04:13:55,274 --> 04:13:56,735
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Attorney Stein.

2823
04:13:58,975 --> 04:13:59,836
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm sure we'll connect.

2824
04:13:59,876 --> 04:14:00,276
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2825
04:14:00,556 --> 04:14:01,296
[SPEAKER_20]: Appreciate it, everyone.

2826
04:14:02,982 --> 04:14:11,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, so the next item in front of us is the Definitive Subdivision Plan, Bridal Path Definitive Subdivision.

2827
04:14:11,445 --> 04:14:12,925
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a continued hearing.

2828
04:14:12,945 --> 04:14:19,107
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe we have Attorney Kathy Desmond on the request line.

2829
04:14:19,668 --> 04:14:21,668
[SPEAKER_20]: Would you like to present updated plans?

2830
04:14:21,688 --> 04:14:25,149
[SPEAKER_20]: I see you're muted.

2831
04:14:25,169 --> 04:14:26,610
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to ask to unmute.

2832
04:14:31,791 --> 04:14:32,492
[SPEAKER_29]: Are you cutting the work?

2833
04:14:32,572 --> 04:14:32,792
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

2834
04:14:33,072 --> 04:14:33,653
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2835
04:14:33,853 --> 04:14:34,133
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

2836
04:14:34,293 --> 04:14:34,573
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

2837
04:14:34,613 --> 04:14:34,974
[SPEAKER_29]: Terrific.

2838
04:14:35,354 --> 04:14:37,796
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening chairperson, headman and board members.

2839
04:14:38,156 --> 04:14:41,039
[SPEAKER_29]: We do have updated plans to share with you.

2840
04:14:41,119 --> 04:14:47,744
[SPEAKER_29]: I can skip the introduction at this point and hand the matter over to Jack Sullivan, the project engineer.

2841
04:14:47,824 --> 04:14:52,308
[SPEAKER_29]: He's here as well as the developer, Ron Lopez.

2842
04:14:53,209 --> 04:14:55,270
[SPEAKER_29]: So let me hand it over to Jack Sullivan.

2843
04:14:55,651 --> 04:14:58,393
[SPEAKER_29]: And if I could share my screen, then I can put the plans up.

2844
04:14:59,753 --> 04:15:01,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia or Danielle, are you able to handle that?

2845
04:15:01,834 --> 04:15:02,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

2846
04:15:02,394 --> 04:15:03,334
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all set to share.

2847
04:15:04,155 --> 04:15:04,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2848
04:15:05,335 --> 04:15:08,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's my... Wait a minute.

2849
04:15:10,597 --> 04:15:14,559
[SPEAKER_15]: I can send Jack and unmute, but I'm not sure what his display name is.

2850
04:15:14,599 --> 04:15:19,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm just trying to find my... I'm on with Kathleen.

2851
04:15:21,461 --> 04:15:23,182
[SPEAKER_36]: We're all in one room tonight.

2852
04:15:23,442 --> 04:15:26,043
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I'm just trying to share.

2853
04:15:29,597 --> 04:15:30,357
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, excuse me.

2854
04:15:30,377 --> 04:15:30,777
[SPEAKER_20]: Coming up.

2855
04:15:31,978 --> 04:15:35,858
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I'm on the wrong thing though, so I've got to close the current tab.

2856
04:15:36,458 --> 04:15:47,461
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is going to, this is where I'm going to need a minute before the next hearing because I've now closed everything but the subdivision plan so that I head out.

2857
04:15:47,641 --> 04:15:48,201
[SPEAKER_29]: But here it is.

2858
04:15:48,241 --> 04:15:49,441
[SPEAKER_29]: It's correct now, right?

2859
04:15:49,921 --> 04:15:53,782
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, we've seen Bridal Path Definitive Subdivision off of Franklin Avenue.

2860
04:15:53,962 --> 04:15:54,422
[SPEAKER_29]: Terrific.

2861
04:15:54,742 --> 04:15:55,102
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

2862
04:15:56,423 --> 04:15:58,603
[SPEAKER_20]: And please be generous with your Zoom as well.

2863
04:16:00,449 --> 04:16:02,470
[SPEAKER_36]: All right, thank you board members for the record.

2864
04:16:02,511 --> 04:16:03,591
[SPEAKER_36]: My name's Jack Sullivan.

2865
04:16:03,631 --> 04:16:04,812
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm the project engineer.

2866
04:16:06,233 --> 04:16:09,836
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, we were in before in front of you a couple of weeks ago.

2867
04:16:09,856 --> 04:16:17,582
[SPEAKER_36]: We heard comments from city staff from the board itself in the butters and we've made updates to the to the plan set.

2868
04:16:18,282 --> 04:16:19,043
[SPEAKER_36]: We can go to the next.

2869
04:16:21,332 --> 04:16:23,253
[SPEAKER_36]: This is the existing conditions page.

2870
04:16:23,413 --> 04:16:25,493
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm sure everyone's familiar with the site.

2871
04:16:26,193 --> 04:16:33,315
[SPEAKER_36]: It's basically a 2 acre undeveloped piece of land that we're looking to construct a roadway with 8 single family homes.

2872
04:16:34,215 --> 04:16:35,316
[SPEAKER_36]: You can go to the next sheet.

2873
04:16:37,716 --> 04:16:39,177
[SPEAKER_36]: This is a lot layout plan.

2874
04:16:39,397 --> 04:16:46,318
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a 50 foot right away with a fully compliant cul-de-sac with 8 single family house lots.

2875
04:16:46,558 --> 04:16:49,059
[SPEAKER_36]: All lots conform to all aspects of zoning.

2876
04:16:52,332 --> 04:16:56,773
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, on this sheet, here's some of the changes that were requested.

2877
04:16:58,833 --> 04:17:08,796
[SPEAKER_36]: On Franklin Avenue and Headland Way, we relocated the crosswalk to a new location that was recommended by Todd Blake.

2878
04:17:09,536 --> 04:17:10,936
[SPEAKER_36]: So that change has been made.

2879
04:17:12,177 --> 04:17:18,498
[SPEAKER_36]: Additionally, based on the fire department's comments, we increased the travel width

2880
04:17:19,238 --> 04:17:22,581
[SPEAKER_36]: Around the cul-de-sac, it's now 30 feet of pavement.

2881
04:17:23,181 --> 04:17:27,464
[SPEAKER_36]: We did that by reducing the size of the landscaped island in the middle.

2882
04:17:28,345 --> 04:17:34,068
[SPEAKER_36]: Those plans were given to the fire chief and our traffic engineer showed that.

2883
04:17:35,822 --> 04:17:41,386
[SPEAKER_36]: the turning movements of the largest fire truck could easily traverse this subdivision.

2884
04:17:41,487 --> 04:17:44,029
[SPEAKER_36]: So those were the major changes made.

2885
04:17:44,549 --> 04:17:57,259
[SPEAKER_36]: Also, from some of the public comment, there was a question where Franklin Ave is a private way, if they'd be resurfacing of Franklin Avenue.

2886
04:17:57,767 --> 04:18:03,857
[SPEAKER_36]: There's a shaded area we show along the frontage of our site that we're showing an overlay to be completed as part of the project.

2887
04:18:16,376 --> 04:18:29,382
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, this is the two existing homes to the rear of this property that are somewhat landlocked that have a right-of-way currently through the property.

2888
04:18:30,002 --> 04:18:34,924
[SPEAKER_36]: This plan shows how access will remain to those homes during construction.

2889
04:18:34,944 --> 04:18:41,707
[SPEAKER_36]: There'll be a 12-foot wide gravel driveway so that there's always access for those two residents.

2890
04:18:43,167 --> 04:18:44,328
[SPEAKER_36]: We can go to the next slide.

2891
04:18:45,559 --> 04:18:48,842
[SPEAKER_36]: And these are just some of the standard construction details for the site.

2892
04:18:49,763 --> 04:18:55,548
[SPEAKER_36]: As I stated in my 1st meeting, I did have an opportunity to have a zoom meeting with the city engineer Owen.

2893
04:18:56,008 --> 04:18:57,630
[SPEAKER_36]: We reviewed the drainage system.

2894
04:18:58,511 --> 04:19:04,035
[SPEAKER_36]: He agreed with the detailed drainage stormwater report that I prepared for this subdivision.

2895
04:19:05,977 --> 04:19:09,981
[SPEAKER_36]: Also, with the proposed utility connections was showing an 8 inch.

2896
04:19:10,781 --> 04:19:12,563
[SPEAKER_36]: Waterline and an 8 inch sewer line.

2897
04:19:13,171 --> 04:19:16,032
[SPEAKER_36]: His only concern was where this is a dead end water main.

2898
04:19:16,092 --> 04:19:25,396
[SPEAKER_36]: He wanted to make sure there'd be enough water turnover, basically water usage, so that the water in the eight inch water main did not go stagnant.

2899
04:19:26,076 --> 04:19:29,298
[SPEAKER_36]: I provided calculations showing this will turn over daily.

2900
04:19:29,318 --> 04:19:32,559
[SPEAKER_36]: He was looking for at least within 72 hours.

2901
04:19:32,639 --> 04:19:38,662
[SPEAKER_36]: So we did, even though it's a dead end lane, we do meet that turnover requirement for the water use.

2902
04:19:40,020 --> 04:19:45,602
[SPEAKER_36]: I think for the sake of time, I'll turn it back over to the board for questions that you might have.

2903
04:19:48,103 --> 04:19:48,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2904
04:19:53,205 --> 04:19:57,187
[SPEAKER_20]: So the way it's going to go, we're going to open it back up to the board for questions, comments.

2905
04:19:58,007 --> 04:20:00,388
[SPEAKER_20]: Following that, we're going to open the public comment period.

2906
04:20:01,968 --> 04:20:06,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Once we close the public comment period, it goes back to the board for deliberation.

2907
04:20:06,030 --> 04:20:09,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to kind of give people a preview.

2908
04:20:10,733 --> 04:20:19,579
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that, I'd like to open it to the board for any questions or comments that they have for the applicant.

2909
04:20:22,701 --> 04:20:29,625
[SPEAKER_20]: I know one of the things we had talked about at previous meetings was access between this development and the high school.

2910
04:20:29,645 --> 04:20:35,649
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to see if there is any progress or updates there.

2911
04:20:38,400 --> 04:20:40,463
[SPEAKER_20]: given that it is so incredibly close.

2912
04:20:45,831 --> 04:20:47,294
[SPEAKER_29]: Would you like me to speak to that?

2913
04:20:47,314 --> 04:20:48,936
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, please.

2914
04:20:49,760 --> 04:21:05,091
[SPEAKER_29]: So with respect to that, our position is that it's a private way and that the current owner of the property is very opposed to it for the reasons stated in his letter.

2915
04:21:05,891 --> 04:21:14,917
[SPEAKER_29]: There was a previous history of kids hanging about, motorcycles traversing through the area.

2916
04:21:16,318 --> 04:21:19,739
[SPEAKER_29]: and he is vehemently opposed to that occurring.

2917
04:21:20,619 --> 04:21:34,723
[SPEAKER_29]: In addition, and I've pointed this out to staff, and it's not that we don't understand the situation, it's just that we have an owner who is vehemently opposed and it's a private way.

2918
04:21:36,623 --> 04:21:41,625
[SPEAKER_29]: And under the subdivision rules and regulations, the rules and regulations don't allow

2919
04:21:42,985 --> 04:21:46,868
[SPEAKER_29]: for dedication to public way other than parks.

2920
04:21:47,548 --> 04:22:00,856
[SPEAKER_29]: And under the Section 81Q of 41, the regulations in effect have to provide for the taking for public use.

2921
04:22:01,296 --> 04:22:07,540
[SPEAKER_29]: And in this case, the only regulations are those that are related to 81U, which relate to parks.

2922
04:22:08,200 --> 04:22:10,822
[SPEAKER_29]: And that is in Section 6 of the regulations.

2923
04:22:11,302 --> 04:22:11,763
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe it's 6.4.

2924
04:22:13,688 --> 04:22:21,391
[SPEAKER_29]: So, I don't think that it would be a valid condition under the subdivision rules and regulations and the statute.

2925
04:22:21,851 --> 04:22:36,336
[SPEAKER_29]: Also, there would be a requirement, even if there were a regulation that permitted this to occur, there would be a requirement that there be some just compensation to the owners for purposes of this.

2926
04:22:37,137 --> 04:22:39,678
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's the other issue that we have in this.

2927
04:22:41,432 --> 04:22:51,189
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, it's, it would be city, I'm assuming as an easement to the city and the city would be responsible for the maintenance and whatnot, but it ends up coming out onto a private way.

2928
04:22:52,674 --> 04:23:12,690
[SPEAKER_29]: And as you know, with private ways, because there's been quite a discussion about it this evening, the enforcement in terms of traffic that would result or possibly could result from that pathway would fall upon the owners to enforce because the city doesn't have any right to enforce parking on a private way.

2929
04:23:13,198 --> 04:23:25,581
[SPEAKER_29]: And the letter of John Connors that had been presented in opposition indicated that, in fact, this had become a problem when when people were cutting through his yard, the cars were parking there.

2930
04:23:25,601 --> 04:23:28,721
[SPEAKER_29]: And, you know, I did speak with Ms.

2931
04:23:28,761 --> 04:23:32,082
[SPEAKER_29]: Graham from the building committee for the school.

2932
04:23:32,102 --> 04:23:34,723
[SPEAKER_29]: And I understand that they're only in the

2933
04:23:36,525 --> 04:23:40,187
[SPEAKER_29]: in the exploratory phase at this point in feasibility.

2934
04:23:41,027 --> 04:23:50,231
[SPEAKER_29]: So the question is, if the high school were to be located situated somewhere else, then what becomes with this pathway?

2935
04:23:50,732 --> 04:23:55,754
[SPEAKER_29]: And it becomes more of an issue because then who's really in control of it and it's not just to the school.

2936
04:23:56,314 --> 04:23:57,795
[SPEAKER_29]: So there's the uncertainty of that.

2937
04:23:58,435 --> 04:24:01,917
[SPEAKER_29]: But in addition to that, if it is seen as some kind of a second egress,

2938
04:24:02,858 --> 04:24:07,504
[SPEAKER_29]: Which it was kind of what I believe she thought might happen in this instance.

2939
04:24:07,905 --> 04:24:16,276
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, then you've got cars parking or cars traversing to drop people off to use that access way, creating again

2940
04:24:16,789 --> 04:24:20,850
[SPEAKER_29]: an issue where you've got a private road where there's no city enforcement available.

2941
04:24:21,270 --> 04:24:24,471
[SPEAKER_29]: So at this point, in terms of the subdivision, it's not a public way.

2942
04:24:24,491 --> 04:24:31,633
[SPEAKER_29]: And it would all fall to the owners of the subdivision to control vehicles that were there to use the path.

2943
04:24:32,553 --> 04:24:36,354
[SPEAKER_29]: So, you know, I think that's partly why the owners of, you know,

2944
04:24:37,100 --> 04:24:43,945
[SPEAKER_29]: vehemently opposed to the idea and also the applicant because there's no way to enforce what occurs in this instance.

2945
04:24:44,726 --> 04:24:49,489
[SPEAKER_29]: And the other thing to consider too, I think, is in terms of school use.

2946
04:24:51,170 --> 04:25:00,337
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, we live in New England, so there's a portion of at least five months of the year where that use of the way, I mean, who's going to maintain it in the snow?

2947
04:25:00,598 --> 04:25:06,342
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, you're going to, I just think that in terms of the actual season when school is in session,

2948
04:25:07,420 --> 04:25:20,790
[SPEAKER_29]: you're talking less than possibly half of the period of time, that that would be a pathway that would be easily traversed, you know, assuming it was a winter where we had snow, because you're going from September to June.

2949
04:25:22,051 --> 04:25:24,632
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think you bring up some really good points.

2950
04:25:27,795 --> 04:25:29,276
[SPEAKER_20]: So those are the issues surrounding.

2951
04:25:29,836 --> 04:25:30,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2952
04:25:31,517 --> 04:25:34,880
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle, did you have any additional kind of feedback or insight there?

2953
04:25:36,278 --> 04:25:42,260
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to state for the record that it was a recommendation.

2954
04:25:42,280 --> 04:25:47,421
[SPEAKER_32]: We were never inclined to add a condition against your will.

2955
04:25:47,441 --> 04:25:49,262
[SPEAKER_32]: You don't want it.

2956
04:25:49,282 --> 04:25:52,603
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, just like we work with, we can't force you to do it.

2957
04:25:52,643 --> 04:25:53,423
[SPEAKER_32]: You don't want to do it.

2958
04:25:53,443 --> 04:25:59,185
[SPEAKER_32]: I did when I did visit the site, there was a butter who

2959
04:26:00,245 --> 04:26:13,096
[SPEAKER_32]: said that their kid was going to high school next year and cuts through that actual property owner's yard to get to the school and people are going to still cut through whether you have a formal path or not so.

2960
04:26:14,208 --> 04:26:24,034
[SPEAKER_32]: It is what it is, and I hope that there's no prohibition through the homeowner association requiring a huge fence.

2961
04:26:24,074 --> 04:26:27,096
[SPEAKER_32]: I notice that the fence there does have barbed wire.

2962
04:26:27,116 --> 04:26:37,742
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know which side put that up, but I don't like barbed wire, and I don't know what you have.

2963
04:26:40,799 --> 04:26:51,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the fence that exists there is in fact, well, maybe 15 or 20 feet or more onto the property of either the Fells or the city of Medford.

2964
04:26:51,753 --> 04:26:54,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wouldn't have been property only, but not property.

2965
04:26:54,797 --> 04:26:59,403
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think Mr. Connor said that he had to repair that wire because there was a hole in it.

2966
04:26:59,803 --> 04:27:02,244
[SPEAKER_29]: And he did so in his own comments that was in his letter.

2967
04:27:02,264 --> 04:27:08,588
[SPEAKER_29]: And Danielle, I was just pointing out what the statute says and what the conditions are.

2968
04:27:08,628 --> 04:27:12,449
[SPEAKER_29]: And I appreciate your clarifying that you would not force that.

2969
04:27:12,489 --> 04:27:22,595
[SPEAKER_29]: But I wanted the board to be aware that the ability to do those types of things has to be within the rules and regulations and that there has to be just compensation.

2970
04:27:23,215 --> 04:27:23,375
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2971
04:27:29,006 --> 04:27:30,286
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter, I see you're off mute.

2972
04:27:30,306 --> 04:27:34,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I did not mean to be.

2973
04:27:34,328 --> 04:27:36,348
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have any.

2974
04:27:37,028 --> 04:27:52,293
[SPEAKER_10]: My only comment at this time is I'm glad to see, first of all, the resurfacing for a piece of Franklin, and also the access to the two landlocked properties, as well as the crosswalk relocated as per Todd's recommendation.

2975
04:27:52,413 --> 04:27:55,674
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's my only comments based on anything at this time.

2976
04:27:57,154 --> 04:27:57,354
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

2977
04:27:58,871 --> 04:28:05,354
[SPEAKER_20]: If there's no other board questions or comments, I will now open up the public comment period.

2978
04:28:06,495 --> 04:28:12,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.

2979
04:28:13,519 --> 04:28:22,643
[SPEAKER_20]: Tip for the raise hand function, it may be in your React option in Zoom.

2980
04:28:22,663 --> 04:28:27,265
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you're having trouble, just send Danielle or Alicia a message and we'll make sure your comment is heard.

2981
04:28:31,267 --> 04:28:35,670
[SPEAKER_20]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

2982
04:28:36,570 --> 04:28:39,712
[SPEAKER_20]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

2983
04:28:39,752 --> 04:28:43,494
[SPEAKER_20]: That is a legal requirement for this hearing and all hearings.

2984
04:28:44,275 --> 04:28:52,540
[SPEAKER_20]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members as that's not part of the public record.

2985
04:28:53,600 --> 04:29:00,287
[SPEAKER_20]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, you can message staff for assistance.

2986
04:29:00,587 --> 04:29:02,509
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, that is Alicia and Danielle.

2987
04:29:03,430 --> 04:29:05,192
[SPEAKER_20]: Each participant has two minutes to speak.

2988
04:29:07,815 --> 04:29:10,898
[SPEAKER_20]: And at this time, I don't see any hands.

2989
04:29:12,179 --> 04:29:12,920
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll give it a beat.

2990
04:29:24,414 --> 04:29:49,550
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we have two public comments in our folder, one from the Connors Realty Trust, which Attorney Desmond has mentioned, as well as an email from Jenny Graham to help the board members have all had an opportunity to review.

2991
04:29:52,173 --> 04:29:57,241
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia or Danielle, are you seeing any chats come through with any technical difficulties?

2992
04:29:57,401 --> 04:29:58,583
[SPEAKER_20]: Anybody that wants to comment?

2993
04:29:58,904 --> 04:30:01,087
[SPEAKER_20]: Any additional emails that have come through in the inbox?

2994
04:30:06,737 --> 04:30:06,937
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2995
04:30:28,397 --> 04:30:33,721
[SPEAKER_29]: I would say to the board that I did appreciate the conversation that I had with Ms.

2996
04:30:33,741 --> 04:30:39,044
[SPEAKER_29]: Graham yesterday and her bringing information to us as to what the feasibility study is and where it was.

2997
04:30:40,525 --> 04:30:41,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, I'm really glad to hear that.

2998
04:30:41,786 --> 04:30:54,175
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so seeing no public comments coming in, I'm going to go ahead and close the public comment period for this meeting.

2999
04:30:55,716 --> 04:30:57,197
[SPEAKER_20]: That means I'm going to

3000
04:30:58,971 --> 04:31:01,193
[SPEAKER_20]: reopen it to the board for deliberation.

3001
04:31:01,213 --> 04:31:13,401
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's my understanding that some concerns are just being resolved this evening.

3002
04:31:17,023 --> 04:31:19,185
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle, do you have any additional information on that?

3003
04:31:21,857 --> 04:31:30,424
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, around like sometime this afternoon, the city engineer popped into my office and said there was a whole bunch of things that he was writing up.

3004
04:31:31,946 --> 04:31:36,229
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm still unclear on whether it was all resolved.

3005
04:31:36,870 --> 04:31:38,511
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't hear you, Danielle.

3006
04:31:41,734 --> 04:31:45,517
[SPEAKER_32]: Put these stupid things on again.

3007
04:31:45,537 --> 04:31:47,018
[SPEAKER_20]: That's so bizarre.

3008
04:31:47,098 --> 04:31:48,640
[SPEAKER_20]: You seem to be angry when you talk.

3009
04:31:49,360 --> 04:31:57,146
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I'm tired and I'm annoyed and I do any technology just to verify.

3010
04:31:58,147 --> 04:31:59,048
[SPEAKER_32]: Can everybody hear me?

3011
04:31:59,908 --> 04:32:00,189
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

3012
04:32:00,769 --> 04:32:01,129
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

3013
04:32:01,149 --> 04:32:05,993
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, and he had sent an internal email and then I wrote back.

3014
04:32:06,834 --> 04:32:08,415
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you tell the applicants this?

3015
04:32:08,715 --> 04:32:09,736
[SPEAKER_32]: Is this resolved?

3016
04:32:10,257 --> 04:32:10,897
[SPEAKER_32]: What what am I?

3017
04:32:11,578 --> 04:32:13,399
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not sure what direction we have.

3018
04:32:13,479 --> 04:32:14,940
[SPEAKER_32]: Are we voting on this tonight?

3019
04:32:15,481 --> 04:32:15,741
[SPEAKER_32]: Sure.

3020
04:32:18,345 --> 04:32:19,525
[SPEAKER_32]: I think you were copied on that.

3021
04:32:21,006 --> 04:32:23,027
[SPEAKER_32]: Alicia, were you following along?

3022
04:32:23,047 --> 04:32:24,287
[SPEAKER_32]: I've just been so.

3023
04:32:25,728 --> 04:32:32,671
[SPEAKER_15]: There was some back and forth with Owen, our city engineer, and let me call it back up.

3024
04:32:32,851 --> 04:32:35,612
[SPEAKER_20]: Has the applicant seen this information?

3025
04:32:35,632 --> 04:32:36,973
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I'm seeing.

3026
04:32:37,033 --> 04:32:46,857
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say that our most recent email from Owen was at 820 tonight, saying that Kathleen and team provided water calculations in their earlier email.

3027
04:32:49,305 --> 04:33:08,054
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I wasn't clear was, so he had sent us a list of initial review comments, and it seemed to me that these were not, this is from five o'clock today, he sent us a list of eight things that he wanted to see rectified in the submission.

3028
04:33:08,074 --> 04:33:09,254
[SPEAKER_20]: Has the applicant seen that?

3029
04:33:10,114 --> 04:33:11,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Not as far as I'm aware.

3030
04:33:12,015 --> 04:33:12,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

3031
04:33:13,176 --> 04:33:15,377
[SPEAKER_32]: It's an internal email, so we're not,

3032
04:33:16,772 --> 04:33:18,333
[SPEAKER_32]: He's going to forward it.

3033
04:33:18,353 --> 04:33:19,973
[SPEAKER_32]: Totally.

3034
04:33:20,013 --> 04:33:21,654
[SPEAKER_32]: I was like, can you give me something?

3035
04:33:23,234 --> 04:33:27,516
[SPEAKER_32]: It's frustrating with these last minute things.

3036
04:33:27,836 --> 04:33:40,700
[SPEAKER_32]: Then at 755, we got the construction management plan and schedule emailed from Ron Lopez, who is the developer.

3037
04:33:40,720 --> 04:33:42,141
[SPEAKER_32]: I haven't even looked at that.

3038
04:33:42,161 --> 04:33:44,862
[SPEAKER_32]: There's a lot of things coming in.

3039
04:33:45,980 --> 04:33:46,300
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

3040
04:33:46,540 --> 04:33:51,001
[SPEAKER_32]: At the last minute, so I... From both sides, is what I'm hearing.

3041
04:33:51,041 --> 04:34:05,205
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like we don't feel comfortable that what City Engineer is looking for is clarified in the plans, and it's because this back and forth was so late this evening.

3042
04:34:05,225 --> 04:34:10,827
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate continuing cases, but I think that is my recommendation.

3043
04:34:12,087 --> 04:34:18,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Because this is like a bunch of things that are wrong on the plans or not in the right places or problematic.

3044
04:34:19,089 --> 04:34:24,811
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be preventing, you know, things like that that's in the way of where the fire trucks are supposed to go.

3045
04:34:24,831 --> 04:34:29,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so this is rectifiable.

3046
04:34:30,773 --> 04:34:31,213
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

3047
04:34:31,233 --> 04:34:34,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that's that's definitely disappointing.

3048
04:34:35,495 --> 04:34:36,295
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this point,

3049
04:34:39,704 --> 04:34:56,592
[SPEAKER_29]: If I could ask at this point, so that we have written for the next meeting, because we would have them after the, we did submit after the meeting, we submitted some updated information and then on the 24th, I sent over the submitted plans and I did resend them.

3050
04:34:57,472 --> 04:34:57,952
[SPEAKER_29]: today.

3051
04:34:58,953 --> 04:35:01,695
[SPEAKER_29]: But if we had the comments, we certainly would have addressed it.

3052
04:35:01,715 --> 04:35:05,937
[SPEAKER_29]: I just think we haven't had any written comments throughout the process.

3053
04:35:07,518 --> 04:35:09,139
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's part of the difficulty.

3054
04:35:09,199 --> 04:35:16,423
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Lopez met on a zoom with the city engineer.

3055
04:35:17,277 --> 04:35:24,084
[SPEAKER_29]: and went through items and, you know, we tried to document at that point what was covered and what we had.

3056
04:35:24,965 --> 04:35:27,588
[SPEAKER_29]: So, it's kind of a surprise at this point.

3057
04:35:27,628 --> 04:35:36,717
[SPEAKER_29]: And quite honestly, if we had known, I think we would have continued it before the meeting because then we would have, yeah.

3058
04:35:36,837 --> 04:35:39,200
[SPEAKER_32]: And I did recommend that you not continue it.

3059
04:35:39,917 --> 04:35:49,487
[SPEAKER_32]: Go to the last week that we have a packed agenda, and it's unprecedented the load that planning staff and engineering staff have like we literally cannot.

3060
04:35:50,038 --> 04:35:52,760
[SPEAKER_32]: Like, we're working in the evening hours.

3061
04:35:53,540 --> 04:35:54,400
[SPEAKER_32]: It's impossible.

3062
04:35:54,420 --> 04:36:00,704
[SPEAKER_32]: So if we could just spread them out a little bit more, it's impossible.

3063
04:36:00,744 --> 04:36:06,367
[SPEAKER_29]: But there's also timings with purchase and sale agreements and things of those nature that kind of have to keep things moving.

3064
04:36:06,847 --> 04:36:09,549
[SPEAKER_29]: Otherwise, deposits become jeopardy.

3065
04:36:09,949 --> 04:36:16,112
[SPEAKER_20]: So to respect the limitations that we have, to respect the applicant, to respect the public hearing,

3066
04:36:19,337 --> 04:36:20,759
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we continue with those?

3067
04:36:20,779 --> 04:36:23,202
[SPEAKER_29]: I would have continued tonight so that we wouldn't have had to.

3068
04:36:24,801 --> 04:36:26,422
[SPEAKER_20]: No, and I appreciate that.

3069
04:36:26,442 --> 04:36:31,525
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also appreciate the workload that Alicia and Danielle are subject to.

3070
04:36:31,705 --> 04:36:40,610
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys are doing fabulous work for a city that sometimes I feel like doesn't even realize how fast it's growing.

3071
04:36:40,630 --> 04:36:44,012
[SPEAKER_20]: And you all are at the front line of that.

3072
04:36:44,092 --> 04:36:46,253
[SPEAKER_20]: So I deeply and truly appreciate that.

3073
04:36:46,273 --> 04:36:49,095
[SPEAKER_32]: We are dramatically, dramatically understaffed.

3074
04:36:49,815 --> 04:36:50,876
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, it'd be 10 times.

3075
04:36:50,896 --> 04:36:52,156
[SPEAKER_32]: This should be 10 times as much.

3076
04:36:52,536 --> 04:36:53,076
[SPEAKER_32]: Many people.

3077
04:36:53,837 --> 04:36:54,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah.

3078
04:36:54,277 --> 04:36:54,637
[SPEAKER_32]: On this.

3079
04:36:55,217 --> 04:36:57,778
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, if we could make that motion, we would.

3080
04:36:58,219 --> 04:36:58,819
[SPEAKER_20]: Could we?

3081
04:36:59,359 --> 04:37:01,340
[SPEAKER_29]: Daniel, it's not that I don't appreciate that.

3082
04:37:01,400 --> 04:37:03,141
[SPEAKER_29]: I hope you don't think that that's the case.

3083
04:37:03,221 --> 04:37:04,881
[SPEAKER_20]: I just know an attorney doesn't.

3084
04:37:04,901 --> 04:37:12,664
[SPEAKER_20]: And I didn't mean to to imply that what I'm trying to get to is like, how can we use this meeting efficiently to either share those concerns with you tonight?

3085
04:37:13,125 --> 04:37:16,206
[SPEAKER_20]: Or can we continue right now?

3086
04:37:16,426 --> 04:37:17,046
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it's

3087
04:37:21,669 --> 04:37:22,069
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know.

3088
04:37:22,089 --> 04:37:29,255
[SPEAKER_29]: I know that you don't want to share that internal memo, but is there anything in terms of the items or the list?

3089
04:37:30,256 --> 04:37:36,481
[SPEAKER_20]: I heard water, which I think was addressed through the flow that we saw, the 72-24 hour.

3090
04:37:37,141 --> 04:37:38,903
[SPEAKER_15]: So Madam Chair, if I might.

3091
04:37:39,143 --> 04:37:39,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

3092
04:37:40,124 --> 04:37:46,089
[SPEAKER_15]: So part of my concern is that it says, here's my initial review of the bridal path.

3093
04:37:46,563 --> 04:38:03,434
[SPEAKER_15]: which says to me that even if we said to you, here's what we need, and you said, put them all in as conditions were good, that he, because it was earlier today that the engineer asked for plans to scale.

3094
04:38:03,454 --> 04:38:10,279
[SPEAKER_15]: And honestly, that should have been sent earlier, but he may have been on vacation for the past two weeks as well.

3095
04:38:10,299 --> 04:38:11,880
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know that.

3096
04:38:12,388 --> 04:38:14,789
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, what I'm hearing is that we're going to continue either way.

3097
04:38:14,809 --> 04:38:42,017
[SPEAKER_20]: My, my, and I, you know, I apologize to applicant for, um, for that, but what I'm trying to get at right now is do we spend time talking through those X number of, of, of, of feedback from the city engineer, or do we just say motion to continue to a date certain and then allow city staff, Peter.

3098
04:38:44,012 --> 04:38:55,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Just my two cents of what I'm hearing is I think we should continue to date certain because it seems that we're not going to get all of the information that the applicant needs because Owen is not on this call.

3099
04:38:57,222 --> 04:39:06,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think what we really need is for the city engineer to communicate with the with the team his his concerns or

3100
04:39:08,670 --> 04:39:19,501
[SPEAKER_10]: planning staff to communicate those concerns to the team and talking through who, what may have been in an email internally is not going to get anyone where they want to be tonight.

3101
04:39:20,523 --> 04:39:21,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Ari, what do you think?

3102
04:39:23,265 --> 04:39:25,348
[SPEAKER_20]: Brevity is the gift that you can give all of us.

3103
04:39:26,547 --> 04:39:39,558
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree with Peter, I don't think there's any way we can have a full discussion given what we just found out, and it's late, and I'm not feeling great, and I definitely would make a motion to continue.

3104
04:39:39,578 --> 04:39:45,323
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, and we do still have additional matters in front of this board.

3105
04:39:46,044 --> 04:39:50,748
[SPEAKER_20]: I did hear a motion from Ari, and then I heard the first second from Peter.

3106
04:39:55,182 --> 04:40:02,409
[SPEAKER_20]: Unless there's any kind of procedural items that we need to be aware of from city staff, I'm going to do a roll call vote.

3107
04:40:02,569 --> 04:40:04,230
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, I apologize to the applicant.

3108
04:40:06,572 --> 04:40:11,317
[SPEAKER_20]: You have our sincerest apologies for this, and we thank you for your patience and understanding.

3109
04:40:11,337 --> 04:40:14,299
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that, I'm going to do a roll call vote.

3110
04:40:14,440 --> 04:40:18,183
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter Calves, to continue to a date certain is February 5th.

3111
04:40:21,766 --> 04:40:45,950
[SPEAKER_29]: yes that is that date work for applicant that is the first date that we have that would be i'm sorry i was just talking to my client with the date would be yes um and public comment at this point is officially closed i just want to confirm yes yes okay the purposes of the continuance would be for board deliberation um uh

3112
04:40:51,253 --> 04:41:00,929
[SPEAKER_20]: any new information related to Owens, the city engineers, feedback, and then if appropriate, a motion.

3113
04:41:02,881 --> 04:41:04,643
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's start again, just in case, yep.

3114
04:41:05,264 --> 04:41:05,784
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have a question?

3115
04:41:05,824 --> 04:41:08,287
[SPEAKER_29]: I guess the one question, can you vote on the waiver?

3116
04:41:08,567 --> 04:41:12,511
[SPEAKER_29]: There is the waiver issue, the waiver of the street rounding.

3117
04:41:12,611 --> 04:41:16,836
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know, without the engineer's approval, if you can't do that, you probably can't, right?

3118
04:41:16,876 --> 04:41:18,157
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's probably going to have to wait.

3119
04:41:18,197 --> 04:41:19,178
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't believe we can.

3120
04:41:19,278 --> 04:41:20,820
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's all inclusive at this point.

3121
04:41:20,860 --> 04:41:21,120
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

3122
04:41:21,721 --> 04:41:23,243
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, but I appreciate you asking.

3123
04:41:24,125 --> 04:41:29,168
[SPEAKER_20]: So, at this point, um, we are voting on a motion to continue to a date.

3124
04:41:29,208 --> 04:41:31,829
[SPEAKER_20]: Certain February 5th, uh, Peter cobs.

3125
04:41:32,890 --> 04:41:35,991
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, uh, Ari Fishman.

3126
04:41:36,632 --> 04:41:38,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Annie Strang.

3127
04:41:39,073 --> 04:41:40,994
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Ben LaValle.

3128
04:41:41,014 --> 04:41:45,276
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, uh, Sabrina Alpino.

3129
04:41:45,296 --> 04:41:46,297
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

3130
04:41:47,407 --> 04:41:51,430
[SPEAKER_20]: And myself, Emily Hedeman, is an I. This matter will be continued to February 5th.

3131
04:41:51,950 --> 04:41:52,911
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you to the applicant.

3132
04:41:53,712 --> 04:41:55,433
[SPEAKER_20]: And we will see you next month.

3133
04:41:56,053 --> 04:41:57,975
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, actually, you're still on here.

3134
04:41:58,095 --> 04:41:59,216
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

3135
04:41:59,336 --> 04:42:10,865
[SPEAKER_29]: And if I could just have one moment just to upload my documents, because when I went through, I inadvertently Xed out the vital path.

3136
04:42:10,905 --> 04:42:12,085
[SPEAKER_29]: It'll take me two seconds.

3137
04:42:12,826 --> 04:42:15,288
[SPEAKER_29]: But I had those set, and then I just

3138
04:42:16,260 --> 04:42:23,503
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess I can start saying my spiel and then when you're ready, you can just you can share because I believe you should still have permission.

3139
04:42:23,523 --> 04:42:24,984
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

3140
04:42:25,284 --> 04:42:25,484
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

3141
04:42:25,964 --> 04:42:26,164
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

3142
04:42:26,265 --> 04:42:26,805
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks, Alicia.

3143
04:42:26,825 --> 04:42:28,225
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

3144
04:42:28,265 --> 04:42:32,247
[SPEAKER_20]: So the next item before us is a new public hearing.

3145
04:42:32,267 --> 04:42:33,968
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

3146
04:42:35,071 --> 04:42:36,872
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just going to throw you on mute, Attorney Desmond.

3147
04:42:37,973 --> 04:42:40,155
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a new public hearing.

3148
04:42:40,375 --> 04:42:43,357
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a special permit for a second principal structure.

3149
04:42:43,377 --> 04:42:51,322
[SPEAKER_20]: This is special permit 2024-6, underscore 55, underscore Myrtle Street CDB.

3150
04:42:51,342 --> 04:42:56,686
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is 55 and 0 Myrtle Street Bartlett Development LLC.

3151
04:42:58,121 --> 04:43:07,939
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, this is a new public hearing, and the notice reads that the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on January 15, 2025.

3152
04:43:11,760 --> 04:43:12,821
[SPEAKER_20]: After 6.30 p.m.

3153
04:43:13,001 --> 04:43:30,606
[SPEAKER_20]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to an application for special permit submitted by Bartlett Development LLC to construct a second principal structure, just a single-family dwelling, located in the SF2 zoning district at 55 and 0 Myrtle Street.

3154
04:43:31,827 --> 04:43:34,448
[SPEAKER_20]: The assessor's map, it's N14, parcels 44 and 43.

3155
04:43:38,429 --> 04:43:40,871
[SPEAKER_20]: That's Medford, Massachusetts 021-55.

3156
04:43:42,772 --> 04:43:55,159
[SPEAKER_20]: This proposal requires a special permit for the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance section 94-3111 and requires approval from the Community Development Board.

3157
04:43:55,179 --> 04:44:06,046
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to ask Attorney Desmond to present the proposal on behalf of the applicant whenever you are ready.

3158
04:44:06,973 --> 04:44:09,535
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Chairperson Hederman.

3159
04:44:10,175 --> 04:44:11,516
[SPEAKER_29]: Kathleen Desmond of Redding.

3160
04:44:11,596 --> 04:44:19,320
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm here this evening with the manager of Bartlett Development, Nelson Oliveira, and his design team, Mariana Galstead.

3161
04:44:20,001 --> 04:44:34,689
[SPEAKER_29]: The project before you seeks a special permit pursuant to section 3.1.1.1 of the ordinance to construct a second principal structure, specifically a single family home on the same lot as the existing single family dwelling.

3162
04:44:36,252 --> 04:44:46,475
[SPEAKER_29]: The subject parcel is an approximately 9,666 square foot parcel of land consisting of two assessor's parcels located in the SF-2 district.

3163
04:44:47,075 --> 04:44:55,778
[SPEAKER_29]: The lots cannot be subdivided as a result of the merger doctrine due to inadequate lot width which is deficient by approximately 6.1 feet.

3164
04:44:56,318 --> 04:44:59,179
[SPEAKER_29]: The width for each lot if you were intending to subdivide

3165
04:44:59,599 --> 04:45:07,084
[SPEAKER_29]: would be 50 feet and lot area which is deficient by approximately 334 square feet.

3166
04:45:07,565 --> 04:45:11,127
[SPEAKER_29]: The lot in each instance would need to be 5,000 square feet.

3167
04:45:11,147 --> 04:45:18,332
[SPEAKER_29]: The lot with the existing property is in fact over 5,000 square feet.

3168
04:45:18,352 --> 04:45:20,294
[SPEAKER_29]: It's 5,180 square feet.

3169
04:45:20,454 --> 04:45:27,519
[SPEAKER_29]: But even if you were able to cobble together, if I can share my screen, let me see.

3170
04:45:29,006 --> 04:45:29,646
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, okay.

3171
04:45:29,766 --> 04:45:34,089
[SPEAKER_29]: If you were even able to cobble together the, are you seeing that?

3172
04:45:34,169 --> 04:45:34,849
[SPEAKER_29]: You are, right?

3173
04:45:35,649 --> 04:45:47,195
[SPEAKER_29]: The lot area, the issue then arises that the property, and if I can scale down to the plot plan here.

3174
04:45:48,797 --> 04:45:58,360
[SPEAKER_29]: that the existing house, if you look at this plot plan, so this is your lot here, and the existing house is almost sits squarely in the middle.

3175
04:45:58,401 --> 04:46:03,022
[SPEAKER_29]: So you need a seven and a half foot side yard setback, and this is 23.

3176
04:46:03,882 --> 04:46:15,007
[SPEAKER_29]: So even if you were to attempt to subdivide the lots, if you were able to cobble the 150 and take some from the other property adjacent to, because that's a 5,400 square foot lot,

3177
04:46:16,367 --> 04:46:25,549
[SPEAKER_29]: In a perfect world, if you could get that to all work out, you'd still be in a situation where you would need to demolish the existing structure.

3178
04:46:25,569 --> 04:46:30,950
[SPEAKER_29]: And the existing structure does have some historical significance.

3179
04:46:32,011 --> 04:46:36,312
[SPEAKER_29]: It has gone before the historical board.

3180
04:46:36,652 --> 04:46:42,593
[SPEAKER_29]: And because this was not a teardown situation, and they were raising the roof and not changing the roof line,

3181
04:46:43,280 --> 04:46:46,503
[SPEAKER_29]: they allowed it to go forward so they weren't changing the structure.

3182
04:46:47,203 --> 04:46:57,371
[SPEAKER_29]: So in that respect, even if you could request a variance, you'd still need to take some action to demolish in order to place two houses on the lot.

3183
04:46:57,691 --> 04:46:59,113
[SPEAKER_29]: So merger in this case really is

3184
04:46:59,913 --> 04:47:04,436
[SPEAKER_29]: merger because it's very difficult to subdivide the lots.

3185
04:47:05,037 --> 04:47:16,665
[SPEAKER_29]: As noted on the plans itself and the zoning legend, the construction of a single-family dwelling, second single-family dwelling, will meet all the other zoning requirements of the district.

3186
04:47:17,486 --> 04:47:24,992
[SPEAKER_29]: The plan calls for a single curb cut and a 12-foot driveway so there won't be a request for an additional curb cut which would not

3187
04:47:26,904 --> 04:47:29,325
[SPEAKER_29]: would have some difficulty being approved through engineering.

3188
04:47:29,945 --> 04:47:41,632
[SPEAKER_29]: There are two exterior parking spaces and two garage spaces, so each unit meets the two cars per unit requirement in the SF2 district.

3189
04:47:42,253 --> 04:47:46,155
[SPEAKER_29]: And the combined lot coverage of the existing and the proposed dwelling is only 24%.

3190
04:47:47,636 --> 04:47:51,240
[SPEAKER_29]: opposed to in a single family home, you could have lot coverage equal to 40%.

3191
04:47:51,320 --> 04:47:58,308
[SPEAKER_29]: From a neighborhood perspective, and we can show this when we go through the slides, I'm going to have the architect go through the design.

3192
04:47:59,370 --> 04:48:02,573
[SPEAKER_29]: The neighborhood itself, I think on Myrtle Street, there's roughly 28 houses.

3193
04:48:04,529 --> 04:48:08,750
[SPEAKER_29]: single family lots that are undersized, that are not 5,000 square feet.

3194
04:48:09,370 --> 04:48:20,693
[SPEAKER_29]: So in terms of the character of the neighborhood and the lot size, I think anyone walking down the street wouldn't notice that, in fact, the lot was somehow deficient.

3195
04:48:20,773 --> 04:48:23,353
[SPEAKER_29]: Again, it's only 339 square feet.

3196
04:48:23,393 --> 04:48:30,575
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's going to look in the neighborhood as if it is two single family homes meeting all the setback requirements.

3197
04:48:31,204 --> 04:48:39,329
[SPEAKER_29]: Mariana is on the call and I can have her go through the plans with you.

3198
04:48:39,649 --> 04:48:40,850
[SPEAKER_29]: I can share my screen again.

3199
04:48:40,970 --> 04:48:42,431
[SPEAKER_29]: Mariana, are you there?

3200
04:48:44,452 --> 04:48:45,333
[SPEAKER_29]: I think she's muted.

3201
04:48:45,753 --> 04:48:46,353
[SPEAKER_29]: I can see her.

3202
04:48:46,373 --> 04:48:47,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here.

3203
04:48:47,194 --> 04:48:48,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me?

3204
04:48:48,935 --> 04:48:49,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

3205
04:48:49,475 --> 04:48:49,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

3206
04:48:49,976 --> 04:48:53,918
[SPEAKER_29]: Would you like to share your screen or do you want to trust me with that?

3207
04:48:54,979 --> 04:48:55,879
[SPEAKER_27]: I could do either.

3208
04:48:55,919 --> 04:48:56,760
[SPEAKER_27]: We can go through your screen.

3209
04:48:56,780 --> 04:48:58,021
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the same document.

3210
04:48:59,224 --> 04:49:00,745
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, so are you gonna go through?

3211
04:49:02,045 --> 04:49:02,845
[SPEAKER_27]: I can go through with it.

3212
04:49:04,266 --> 04:49:06,426
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, do you wanna share your screen?

3213
04:49:06,827 --> 04:49:07,847
[SPEAKER_27]: Certainly, give me a minute.

3214
04:49:08,607 --> 04:49:08,907
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks.

3215
04:49:08,927 --> 04:49:13,609
[SPEAKER_30]: I should rather I just do it.

3216
04:49:17,850 --> 04:49:19,011
[SPEAKER_29]: Would you rather I just share?

3217
04:49:22,392 --> 04:49:25,493
[SPEAKER_20]: Does Mariana have permission to share, Danielle or Alicia?

3218
04:49:26,812 --> 04:49:27,892
[SPEAKER_15]: I just gave her permission.

3219
04:49:28,512 --> 04:49:29,733
[SPEAKER_20]: Wonderful, thank you so much.

3220
04:49:43,535 --> 04:49:44,095
[SPEAKER_29]: I can share.

3221
04:49:44,855 --> 04:49:46,956
[SPEAKER_27]: Why don't you go ahead and share and I can talk through it.

3222
04:49:47,336 --> 04:49:47,596
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

3223
04:49:47,616 --> 04:49:52,957
[SPEAKER_30]: Let me just put this up.

3224
04:49:55,968 --> 04:50:00,031
[SPEAKER_27]: So the first slide is just the overview of the two homes.

3225
04:50:00,731 --> 04:50:04,574
[SPEAKER_27]: The home to the right is the existing, and the home to the left is the proposed.

3226
04:50:05,915 --> 04:50:11,419
[SPEAKER_27]: And as you can see on the bottom, we have the square footages per.

3227
04:50:12,299 --> 04:50:17,663
[SPEAKER_27]: And right now it's labeled as 57, but that's only because of the assumption of the numbers.

3228
04:50:18,664 --> 04:50:23,247
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's broken down by the first floor and second floor, and the total square footage of it being 1,688 square feet.

3229
04:50:27,147 --> 04:50:39,154
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, and then the second, these slides just essentially are showing the floor plan, which is three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms.

3230
04:50:39,654 --> 04:50:44,717
[SPEAKER_27]: So the first floor would just be your living space, kitchen, half bath.

3231
04:50:47,379 --> 04:50:52,602
[SPEAKER_27]: And then as you go upstairs to the second floor is where you have the three bedrooms.

3232
04:50:58,156 --> 04:51:02,359
[SPEAKER_27]: You have the three bedrooms and then two bathrooms, one of the primary and then the secondary bath.

3233
04:51:03,620 --> 04:51:09,805
[SPEAKER_27]: And then the top floor, which is just the attic space, which will be just like storage.

3234
04:51:17,411 --> 04:51:25,278
[SPEAKER_27]: And then this is the footprint of the basement, and this again will be unfinished basement slash storage space for the home.

3235
04:51:29,594 --> 04:51:33,898
[SPEAKER_27]: And as we go, it's a plot plan, a site plan.

3236
04:51:33,958 --> 04:51:36,100
[SPEAKER_29]: If I could explain here, Mariana.

3237
04:51:37,020 --> 04:51:38,502
[SPEAKER_29]: So at this point, we have eight.

3238
04:51:39,002 --> 04:51:40,603
[SPEAKER_29]: It meets all the setback requirements.

3239
04:51:40,623 --> 04:51:41,304
[SPEAKER_29]: This is eight.

3240
04:51:41,704 --> 04:51:45,528
[SPEAKER_29]: That's 23, as we explained before, based on where the situation of the existing is.

3241
04:51:45,968 --> 04:51:48,770
[SPEAKER_29]: We've also got more than 15 feet in the rear yard.

3242
04:51:49,611 --> 04:51:53,034
[SPEAKER_29]: Your driveway is 20 at the beginning and 17 in the back.

3243
04:51:53,394 --> 04:51:56,317
[SPEAKER_29]: This common drive will go back to where the garage space is.

3244
04:51:57,306 --> 04:52:04,989
[SPEAKER_29]: In the front of the existing front yard setback on the existing house is 11.6, but the new house will meet the requirement of 15 feet.

3245
04:52:05,449 --> 04:52:12,392
[SPEAKER_29]: So, in terms of the setback requirements of the structures themselves, they will meet those requirements.

3246
04:52:12,472 --> 04:52:15,534
[SPEAKER_29]: It's only the lot area and the width that is deficient.

3247
04:52:16,374 --> 04:52:17,495
[SPEAKER_29]: And the lot area only by 3%.

3248
04:52:22,042 --> 04:52:24,004
[SPEAKER_27]: And these are just the elevations of the homes.

3249
04:52:24,064 --> 04:52:26,446
[SPEAKER_27]: As you can see, the height structure is the same.

3250
04:52:26,566 --> 04:52:32,031
[SPEAKER_27]: Both homes will be on the same height level, which is 32 feet and 10 inches, respectively.

3251
04:52:39,958 --> 04:52:43,661
[SPEAKER_29]: And that just gives you the side view of the homes.

3252
04:52:52,366 --> 04:53:06,335
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is the GIS map that I was discussing previously, which shows, let me see if I can pull this over, I can, which basically shows that all of these lots in here are roughly

3253
04:53:07,600 --> 04:53:09,521
[SPEAKER_29]: under the 4,000 square foot mark.

3254
04:53:10,281 --> 04:53:12,322
[SPEAKER_29]: And then here's the lot in question.

3255
04:53:12,342 --> 04:53:18,925
[SPEAKER_29]: This is the existing lot with the existing house, which shows on the GSI that this may actually encroach over.

3256
04:53:19,425 --> 04:53:22,726
[SPEAKER_29]: It's tough to say, but it's definitely on that parcel lot line.

3257
04:53:23,267 --> 04:53:27,908
[SPEAKER_29]: So even if you took something from here, you'd still have to deal with that structure.

3258
04:53:28,709 --> 04:53:36,072
[SPEAKER_29]: And then the next slide shows you on Myrtle Street how many of the houses, you know, by address and

3259
04:53:38,252 --> 04:53:43,516
[SPEAKER_29]: how many of those houses are under the requirement of 5,000 square feet.

3260
04:53:43,616 --> 04:53:56,724
[SPEAKER_29]: And like I said, I think there's approximately 28, 29 of those structures within the stretch of Myrtle Street that are less than the required lot area or $5,000.

3261
04:53:57,145 --> 04:54:00,267
[SPEAKER_29]: Maria, if you want to go through the renderings.

3262
04:54:01,087 --> 04:54:10,175
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure, and these are just the perspectives of the proposed home in the scheme of the street and also comparing to the home that's going to be there.

3263
04:54:10,375 --> 04:54:11,956
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, that's there, I should say.

3264
04:54:13,818 --> 04:54:27,189
[SPEAKER_27]: As you can see, they're pretty much identical in terms of style and roof lines, with the exception of the proposed home just being on the smaller side compared to the existing.

3265
04:54:30,781 --> 04:54:32,202
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, another view.

3266
04:54:36,224 --> 04:54:38,685
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is just a side-by-side comparison of the two.

3267
04:54:38,725 --> 04:54:46,188
[SPEAKER_27]: And you can see the garage in the back for the proposed home, and then the parking, which is behind the existing home.

3268
04:54:52,872 --> 04:54:59,655
[SPEAKER_29]: And then this just gives you a breakdown as to two garage spaces that the new house will have

3269
04:55:00,830 --> 04:55:07,916
[SPEAKER_29]: 1688 square feet, bedrooms will be three, number of bathrooms will be two, two and a half, and then the building height.

3270
04:55:08,797 --> 04:55:13,400
[SPEAKER_29]: So that takes you through the presentation of the units.

3271
04:55:15,342 --> 04:55:21,807
[SPEAKER_29]: And, you know, in terms of the standard and whether it's substantially more detrimental

3272
04:55:22,655 --> 04:55:33,287
[SPEAKER_29]: to the neighborhood, at first it protects and preserves the existing single-family dwelling on the lot, which has some historical significance.

3273
04:55:33,928 --> 04:55:43,098
[SPEAKER_29]: Someone could, if they chose to, come in and build a house that would fill 40% lot coverage of that as a single-family dwelling.

3274
04:55:44,106 --> 04:55:49,669
[SPEAKER_29]: So this preserves the existing house and also creates housing.

3275
04:55:50,069 --> 04:56:12,320
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's consistent with the governor's request, not so much Medford in terms of the lot area, but there is a push in that housing bill that was passed to change merger effectively in some communities so that there could be more single family homes with three bedrooms that are less than

3276
04:56:13,117 --> 04:56:14,038
[SPEAKER_29]: 1800 square feet.

3277
04:56:14,438 --> 04:56:34,211
[SPEAKER_29]: So it meets that wouldn't be out of character with the neighborhood, the lot area and the width deficiencies are both de minimis, it's six feet on the width, and, you know, 300 square feet on the lot area, which revolves to like 3% of the total lot area.

3278
04:56:34,311 --> 04:56:36,312
[SPEAKER_29]: And with that, I'll be quiet.

3279
04:56:40,214 --> 04:56:41,274
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Attorney Desmond.

3280
04:56:41,695 --> 04:56:42,615
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you, Mariana.

3281
04:56:44,135 --> 04:56:49,137
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this point, I would like to open it up to the board for any questions or comments.

3282
04:56:49,977 --> 04:56:52,098
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel that was a very thorough presentation.

3283
04:56:52,118 --> 04:56:58,820
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have any questions or comments besides it feels logical.

3284
04:56:58,900 --> 04:57:03,161
[SPEAKER_20]: It feels like it fits the neighborhood.

3285
04:57:03,221 --> 04:57:08,323
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, I'd be curious to hear what the rest of the board has to say.

3286
04:57:08,343 --> 04:57:09,303
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

3287
04:57:10,546 --> 04:57:17,050
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a lot of detail for any time, particularly impressive amount of detail for 11.35 PM.

3288
04:57:17,070 --> 04:57:20,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't fall asleep till 2 now, so.

3289
04:57:24,154 --> 04:57:28,017
[SPEAKER_10]: But I appreciate the level of detail, and I think there's nothing I can think of immediately.

3290
04:57:29,898 --> 04:57:36,922
[SPEAKER_31]: No, it seemed that the drawings were very clear and the direction you were going, and I have no questions.

3291
04:57:39,825 --> 04:57:44,750
[SPEAKER_20]: So if there's no additional comments or questions from the board, I'm going to open up the public comment period.

3292
04:57:44,770 --> 04:57:50,155
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, as a board, we will have opportunity for deliberation post public comment period.

3293
04:57:51,445 --> 04:57:53,406
[SPEAKER_20]: So I will now open the public comment period.

3294
04:57:53,987 --> 04:58:00,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.

3295
04:58:00,811 --> 04:58:06,575
[SPEAKER_20]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

3296
04:58:07,496 --> 04:58:10,598
[SPEAKER_20]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

3297
04:58:11,078 --> 04:58:11,998
[SPEAKER_20]: That is a requirement.

3298
04:58:12,919 --> 04:58:21,584
[SPEAKER_20]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members, as that is not part of the public record.

3299
04:58:22,965 --> 04:58:35,012
[SPEAKER_20]: However, if a participant is having audio or technical difficulties, you can message staff for assistance, and that is Alicia and Danielle.

3300
04:58:35,852 --> 04:58:37,453
[SPEAKER_20]: Each participant will have two minutes to speak.

3301
04:58:39,144 --> 04:58:44,870
[SPEAKER_20]: So I see one member of the public with their hand raised, Rocco's iPhone.

3302
04:58:49,054 --> 04:58:51,457
[SPEAKER_20]: Please state your name and address for the record, please.

3303
04:58:55,521 --> 04:58:56,282
[SPEAKER_42]: Hello, can you hear me?

3304
04:58:56,903 --> 04:58:57,203
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

3305
04:58:57,824 --> 04:58:58,144
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, beautiful.

3306
04:58:58,464 --> 04:58:58,745
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

3307
04:58:58,765 --> 04:59:00,166
[SPEAKER_42]: I wasn't sure it was unmuted.

3308
04:59:00,286 --> 04:59:06,271
[SPEAKER_42]: My name is Rocco Lombardo and we are on Gibson Street, which is behind Myrtle.

3309
04:59:06,911 --> 04:59:16,939
[SPEAKER_42]: And I guess the question is, are there any offsets for the garage area and presumably the parking lot that will be next to it that abuts against our property?

3310
04:59:19,485 --> 04:59:23,506
[SPEAKER_42]: And the second question is, what is the plan for all the trees between the two properties?

3311
04:59:23,566 --> 04:59:24,667
[SPEAKER_42]: Are they going to be removed?

3312
04:59:25,227 --> 04:59:26,747
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there going to be new trees planted?

3313
04:59:28,688 --> 04:59:29,648
[SPEAKER_42]: We share trees.

3314
04:59:30,169 --> 04:59:35,670
[SPEAKER_42]: We'd just like to understand what the plan between the two properties is going to be.

3315
04:59:37,311 --> 04:59:42,513
[SPEAKER_29]: So I believe the garage is existing, and Nelson can confirm that.

3316
04:59:47,825 --> 04:59:53,428
[SPEAKER_29]: because I believe it shows on the existing plan that we have the site plan.

3317
04:59:54,468 --> 05:00:02,092
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, so the original site plan shows an existing garage and I believe that is staying and is that correct, Nelson?

3318
05:00:05,033 --> 05:00:09,075
[SPEAKER_29]: I think he needs to be unmuted or Mariana.

3319
05:00:09,095 --> 05:00:12,397
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, the existing garage right now

3320
05:00:13,476 --> 05:00:19,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the park, right side of the garage, we kept away from the proper line, per code.

3321
05:00:20,382 --> 05:00:23,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And the trees on the back, we already removed some of the trees.

3322
05:00:23,425 --> 05:00:30,851
[SPEAKER_02]: The trees over there, unless the neighbor wanted to remove, I'm okay to remove the other trees, but I'm okay to keep the trees in place as well.

3323
05:00:31,172 --> 05:00:32,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to remove those trees.

3324
05:00:35,919 --> 05:00:38,702
[SPEAKER_20]: And I realized this was a little bit of an unorthodox public comment.

3325
05:00:39,263 --> 05:00:39,803
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

3326
05:00:40,204 --> 05:00:41,425
[SPEAKER_20]: That's OK.

3327
05:00:41,666 --> 05:00:42,607
[SPEAKER_20]: It's late in the evening.

3328
05:00:44,148 --> 05:00:47,432
[SPEAKER_20]: But I do appreciate that you got your questions answered.

3329
05:00:47,452 --> 05:00:52,017
[SPEAKER_20]: But I do want to recognize that you do have more time if you would like to ask any additional questions.

3330
05:00:53,799 --> 05:00:55,061
[SPEAKER_31]: We'd like to keep the trees, though.

3331
05:00:55,517 --> 05:01:01,001
[SPEAKER_42]: No, I think it would be our vote to keep the trees or as much as possible.

3332
05:01:01,922 --> 05:01:03,623
[SPEAKER_42]: And yeah, that's about it.

3333
05:01:04,204 --> 05:01:05,445
[SPEAKER_42]: So thank you all for your time.

3334
05:01:06,366 --> 05:01:08,387
[SPEAKER_02]: All the remaining trees of the area we intend to keep.

3335
05:01:09,628 --> 05:01:10,329
[SPEAKER_42]: OK, thanks.

3336
05:01:12,030 --> 05:01:12,370
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

3337
05:01:12,390 --> 05:01:13,831
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you for joining so late.

3338
05:01:14,112 --> 05:01:16,814
[SPEAKER_20]: Really appreciate your participation as part of this process.

3339
05:01:24,148 --> 05:01:25,968
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't see any other hands.

3340
05:01:26,348 --> 05:01:29,930
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia or Danielle, have you received any chat messages?

3341
05:01:31,811 --> 05:01:33,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Any additional emails?

3342
05:01:33,051 --> 05:01:37,213
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm looking through our comments folder.

3343
05:01:37,233 --> 05:01:45,176
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't receive any public comment on this one, to the best of my knowledge.

3344
05:01:45,196 --> 05:01:47,157
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

3345
05:01:50,462 --> 05:01:57,625
[SPEAKER_20]: So if there are no more public comments, I'm going to close the public comment period for this evening.

3346
05:01:58,646 --> 05:02:02,528
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to reopen the discussion to the board for deliberation.

3347
05:02:03,725 --> 05:02:19,772
[SPEAKER_20]: And just to kind of set the scene, in order to grant a special permit, we the CDB must find that any adverse effects of the project will not outweigh the beneficial impacts to the city or the neighborhood, taking into consideration the following criteria set forth in section 94-11.

3348
05:02:23,989 --> 05:02:34,397
[SPEAKER_20]: 0.6, 0.2 of the ordinance, or we are able to incorporate conditions of approval that, if satisfied by the applicant, will cause them to be met.

3349
05:02:35,337 --> 05:02:45,025
[SPEAKER_20]: And what we're taking into consideration are, right there with you, Alicia, are the social, economic, or community needs

3350
05:02:46,336 --> 05:02:48,719
[SPEAKER_20]: The traffic flow and safety, including parking and loading.

3351
05:02:49,500 --> 05:02:52,184
[SPEAKER_20]: The adequacy of utilities and other public services.

3352
05:02:52,965 --> 05:02:57,390
[SPEAKER_20]: Compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood.

3353
05:02:58,111 --> 05:02:59,473
[SPEAKER_20]: Impacts on the natural environment.

3354
05:03:00,214 --> 05:03:04,259
[SPEAKER_20]: And the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan.

3355
05:03:06,087 --> 05:03:09,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Based on my perspective, it checks every box.

3356
05:03:10,731 --> 05:03:16,255
[SPEAKER_20]: I am slightly inclined to see if we can put some language somewhere.

3357
05:03:17,948 --> 05:03:19,910
[SPEAKER_20]: to preserve those back trees.

3358
05:03:19,930 --> 05:03:23,893
[SPEAKER_20]: I know things sometimes get crazy during the construction process.

3359
05:03:24,753 --> 05:03:26,214
[SPEAKER_20]: That tree looks so beautiful.

3360
05:03:27,555 --> 05:03:34,840
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'd love it if we could potentially throw some language in there, preserving the trees to the south of the property.

3361
05:03:36,662 --> 05:03:42,086
[SPEAKER_20]: But also curious to hear any feedback or insight or comments from the rest of the board.

3362
05:03:45,248 --> 05:03:45,428
[SPEAKER_20]: Annie?

3363
05:03:47,156 --> 05:03:51,637
[SPEAKER_31]: I vote to keep any tree anywhere, anytime.

3364
05:03:51,737 --> 05:03:56,958
[SPEAKER_31]: So if it's humanly possible, trees Medford.

3365
05:03:58,498 --> 05:04:04,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and I am very excited that this does mean there'll be some more housing in Medford.

3366
05:04:04,640 --> 05:04:10,301
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not an insane amount of housing, but it will add to our housing stock.

3367
05:04:10,321 --> 05:04:14,822
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm always people over trees, but when we can do both, why can't we?

3368
05:04:16,880 --> 05:04:18,141
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I agree with you.

3369
05:04:18,181 --> 05:04:18,481
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter?

3370
05:04:18,501 --> 05:04:20,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with that.

3371
05:04:20,802 --> 05:04:41,275
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think to continue doing my former clerk job before anyone picks it up, say a condition would be the applicant shall preserve the existing trees on the property when feasible.

3372
05:04:43,637 --> 05:04:44,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

3373
05:04:44,778 --> 05:04:50,120
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would clarify that it's the tree to the south of the property, Gibson Street.

3374
05:04:50,521 --> 05:05:03,427
[SPEAKER_20]: If I'm looking at the street view, it looks like there are some trees to the left of the current structure that may need to come down.

3375
05:05:03,547 --> 05:05:05,127
[SPEAKER_20]: So just want to be sensitive to that.

3376
05:05:06,768 --> 05:05:10,410
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, they can preserve as many trees as possible, specifically the one in the back.

3377
05:05:12,088 --> 05:05:13,070
[SPEAKER_20]: That'd be great.

3378
05:05:13,130 --> 05:05:14,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Would the applicant be open to that?

3379
05:05:14,572 --> 05:05:18,018
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney Desmond or Mr. de Oliveira?

3380
05:05:26,166 --> 05:05:28,647
[SPEAKER_29]: Sorry, yes, I believe that we're in agreement.

3381
05:05:28,667 --> 05:05:31,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, all the tree on the left of the property already cut.

3382
05:05:31,508 --> 05:05:33,048
[SPEAKER_02]: The tree we need should be removed.

3383
05:05:33,068 --> 05:05:33,908
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been removed.

3384
05:05:34,128 --> 05:05:36,109
[SPEAKER_02]: All the tree there is going to remain.

3385
05:05:36,569 --> 05:05:37,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Include the pine.

3386
05:05:37,750 --> 05:05:42,111
[SPEAKER_02]: We did everything to keep the pine on the front of it, because this structure just trimmed a little bit.

3387
05:05:42,171 --> 05:05:43,811
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought it's beautiful trees.

3388
05:05:44,231 --> 05:05:45,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I love trees as well.

3389
05:05:45,352 --> 05:05:47,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to keep all the remaining trees of the property.

3390
05:05:47,252 --> 05:05:47,913
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to keep those.

3391
05:05:48,933 --> 05:05:49,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Wonderful.

3392
05:05:49,773 --> 05:05:50,193
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

3393
05:05:50,293 --> 05:05:50,493
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

3394
05:05:56,898 --> 05:06:01,740
[SPEAKER_19]: Ben, Sabrina, Ari, any thoughts?

3395
05:06:02,640 --> 05:06:03,420
[SPEAKER_19]: Sounds good.

3396
05:06:05,941 --> 05:06:06,361
[SPEAKER_17]: No thoughts.

3397
05:06:06,421 --> 05:06:07,502
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with everyone.

3398
05:06:07,522 --> 05:06:22,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to make a motion to approve the site plan as conditioned to preserve all the trees, that the applicant shall preserve all trees on the site.

3399
05:06:26,365 --> 05:06:29,006
[SPEAKER_20]: We're looking for a second motion, Annie.

3400
05:06:29,166 --> 05:06:29,386
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

3401
05:06:29,446 --> 05:06:29,886
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

3402
05:06:29,906 --> 05:06:31,627
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

3403
05:06:32,027 --> 05:06:34,147
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter calls.

3404
05:06:34,167 --> 05:06:37,028
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Ari Fishman.

3405
05:06:37,868 --> 05:06:40,909
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Annie string.

3406
05:06:40,929 --> 05:06:43,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Sabrina Alpino.

3407
05:06:43,990 --> 05:06:45,571
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Ben LaValle.

3408
05:06:45,591 --> 05:06:50,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, and I only had a man and also an eye.

3409
05:06:52,443 --> 05:06:59,489
[SPEAKER_20]: So the special permit is granted with conditions of approval that all existing site trees be maintained.

3410
05:07:00,791 --> 05:07:03,733
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you and thank you for taking this matter on so late in the evening.

3411
05:07:03,753 --> 05:07:08,478
[SPEAKER_29]: I appreciate that all of you did this tonight because I know it's a struggle to do.

3412
05:07:09,211 --> 05:07:11,593
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course, we appreciate your participation in the process.

3413
05:07:11,833 --> 05:07:13,414
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just want to quickly check in.

3414
05:07:13,474 --> 05:07:15,636
[SPEAKER_28]: It looks like he has the best spot, though.

3415
05:07:16,356 --> 05:07:18,878
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it looks like he has the best spot.

3416
05:07:19,339 --> 05:07:23,181
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm at a hotel room in New York on a work trip right now.

3417
05:07:23,382 --> 05:07:24,342
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a long day.

3418
05:07:24,362 --> 05:07:25,943
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

3419
05:07:26,044 --> 05:07:26,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Ben.

3420
05:07:27,525 --> 05:07:34,530
[SPEAKER_20]: Alicia, Danielle, is there any other procedural things that we need related to the Myrtle Street

3421
05:07:36,037 --> 05:07:38,359
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to make sure we don't leave anything hanging.

3422
05:07:38,379 --> 05:07:40,220
[SPEAKER_20]: I know sometimes I do that when it's late.

3423
05:07:40,480 --> 05:07:44,463
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I would just appreciate if Attorney Desmond could draft a decision for me.

3424
05:07:44,603 --> 05:07:44,744
[SPEAKER_29]: Sure.

3425
05:07:44,764 --> 05:07:45,764
[SPEAKER_32]: That'd be great.

3426
05:07:46,905 --> 05:07:53,250
[SPEAKER_29]: Typical as in the zoning decisions, Danielle, is that the format or is there something different that you would want?

3427
05:07:54,611 --> 05:07:59,034
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not married to my format, but I can send you some examples, yeah.

3428
05:07:59,054 --> 05:07:59,915
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, terrific.

3429
05:07:59,955 --> 05:08:00,915
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, okay, great.

3430
05:08:01,856 --> 05:08:04,238
[SPEAKER_20]: Public-private collaboration, all about it.

3431
05:08:05,742 --> 05:08:10,365
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so we are getting to some final items, minutes.

3432
05:08:10,725 --> 05:08:12,807
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we have any minutes to review for this meeting?

3433
05:08:12,827 --> 05:08:16,349
[SPEAKER_32]: I was not able to get them.

3434
05:08:16,950 --> 05:08:22,253
[SPEAKER_32]: It was, I think, two different interns at a Frankenstein together a meeting.

3435
05:08:22,273 --> 05:08:23,774
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, don't worry about it.

3436
05:08:23,794 --> 05:08:25,595
[SPEAKER_32]: It just needed way too much work.

3437
05:08:26,196 --> 05:08:27,597
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, no problem.

3438
05:08:28,459 --> 05:08:31,921
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have a special meeting next week, specifically focused on zoning.

3439
05:08:32,101 --> 05:08:35,323
[SPEAKER_20]: So for now, I'm going to propose that we hold on zoning updates.

3440
05:08:35,584 --> 05:08:40,487
[SPEAKER_20]: So what I will be looking for, and just before we do that, thank you so much for everybody.

3441
05:08:40,727 --> 05:08:42,188
[SPEAKER_20]: We did a great job.

3442
05:08:42,228 --> 05:08:43,048
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm so proud of us.

3443
05:08:43,769 --> 05:08:45,750
[SPEAKER_20]: It takes a lot to do this.

3444
05:08:45,790 --> 05:08:49,512
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know we're all giving up sleep, family time, work time.

3445
05:08:49,773 --> 05:08:50,473
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for it.

3446
05:08:50,873 --> 05:08:53,535
[SPEAKER_20]: But now I'm looking for a motion to adjourn.

3447
05:08:53,555 --> 05:08:56,137
[SPEAKER_20]: So moved.

3448
05:08:57,205 --> 05:09:00,088
[SPEAKER_20]: Second, okay, we're gonna do a roll call vote.

3449
05:09:00,869 --> 05:09:01,530
[SPEAKER_20]: Peter calls.

3450
05:09:02,271 --> 05:09:02,411
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

3451
05:09:03,212 --> 05:09:03,772
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you Fishman?

3452
05:09:05,995 --> 05:09:09,439
[SPEAKER_20]: I. Any string.

3453
05:09:09,459 --> 05:09:09,499
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

3454
05:09:10,460 --> 05:09:11,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Sabrina Alpino.

3455
05:09:11,240 --> 05:09:12,222
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

3456
05:09:13,263 --> 05:09:13,923
[SPEAKER_20]: Bend the valley.

3457
05:09:13,943 --> 05:09:13,984
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

3458
05:09:15,887 --> 05:09:20,489
[SPEAKER_20]: And I, myself, Emily Hedeman, am an enthusiastic I. Thank you, everybody.

3459
05:09:21,189 --> 05:09:22,710
[SPEAKER_20]: Big thanks to Alicia and Danielle.

3460
05:09:23,811 --> 05:09:25,051
[SPEAKER_20]: We could not do this without you.

3461
05:09:25,411 --> 05:09:27,913
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you so much for having us, everyone.

3462
05:09:27,933 --> 05:09:29,873
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks.

3463
05:09:30,094 --> 05:09:30,934
[SPEAKER_20]: Have a good night.
