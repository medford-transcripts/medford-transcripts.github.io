8
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:58,936
Okay, so without further ado, I'm going to go ahead and take the roll.

9
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:03,198
Jenny Graham here.

10
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:05,078
Maria Dorsey?

11
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:05,899
Here.

12
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:09,780
Nicole Morrell?

13
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,520
Here.

14
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,821
What's happening to my spreadsheet here?

15
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:15,942
It's a little cranky.

16
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:17,642
Marissa Desmond?

17
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:19,003
Here.

18
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:20,503
Hi, Marissa.

19
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:22,504
Tom Dalton?

20
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:23,304
Here.

21
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:26,060
And Luke Prisner.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,523
I don't see Luke on yet.

23
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:33,446
He just emailed looking for the Zoom link, so I think he'll be with us any second.

24
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:34,607
I just shot it over to him.

25
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:35,288
Great.

26
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:35,909
Thank you.

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,130
OK.

28
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:39,972
So our agenda for the evening.

29
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:45,925
We have just a handful of things to talk a little bit about.

30
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:56,894
Essentially, all of this information will feed back into a report that I'll give to the school committee on May 20th.

31
00:01:57,414 --> 00:02:10,305
The goal for tonight is to hash through these things in sufficient detail that we can then bring them to the school committee so they understand some of the objectives that we're pursuing from a communications and community engagement perspective.

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,082
As you know, there were 104 or 105 people who wanted to be on the building committee.

33
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:23,223
And they were all very qualified for any number of reasons.

34
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:26,604
And we can't have a committee of 105 people.

35
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:33,728
or actually 115 by the time it's all said and done.

36
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:39,871
I think people are rightfully excited about the project and they want to know how they can participate.

37
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:47,395
I think that goes not just for the folks that applied for the building committee and were not selected, but also just for the community at large.

38
00:02:48,135 --> 00:03:03,332
And I think if you sort of tune into what you're seeing people ask about, you know, again, we're sort of in this like paperwork phase where we have a lot of like legwork to do before we get to the exciting stuff that is going to answer the questions people really have like.

39
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:04,754
Where will it be?

40
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:05,896
And what will it look like?

41
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,498
And will Medford High be renovated?

42
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:08,499
Or will it be new?

43
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:11,023
Or will it be some sort of thing in the middle?

44
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:13,967
And how much will it cost?

45
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:14,828
And when will it be done?

46
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,792
So all of those are like the real exciting questions that I think people.

47
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:25,620
want to get to, but we've got to sort of make our way there over the coming months.

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,205
So I think just talking a little, talking through some of that I think is important for us tonight.

49
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:37,691
I'm going to try to take notes and then firm it up for the larger group, but

50
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:51,279
you know this is a small group so I want to make sure people just feel like they can participate and we'll just sort of plug away at the agenda one piece at a time and hopefully we will not need two full hours to do it.

51
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,540
Does that sound good?

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,442
Okay cool.

53
00:03:56,662 --> 00:04:01,784
So the first thing I wanted to talk through a little bit was the first draft of the website.

54
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:05,746
So Tom is actually going to give us a little bit of an update on that and

55
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:11,552
just where we're at and what sort of his vision is.

56
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:12,333
Hi Luke, how are you?

57
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:19,354
And talk a little bit about like where we are in terms of the formation of the website.

58
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:31,716
So Tom, I'm gonna turn it over to you to give everyone an update and then I'm assuming this group may have some suggestions or thoughts to help inform that first vision.

59
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:36,357
Great, thanks Jenny and hi everyone.

60
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:57,440
To start with just a little bit of background about how we kind of approach the Medford Public Schools website in general, we use a, lets us build out a lot of really nice web pages.

61
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:58,721
If you've been to MPS 02155,

62
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,226
You'll have seen this website.

63
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:05,168
It's been updated.

64
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:09,792
Basically, the school department built a completely new website about two years ago.

65
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:12,515
So we have a nice, fresh website.

66
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:22,764
We're going to be building the building project website on the same architecture and actually as part of the same project.

67
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:28,647
the same web platform.

68
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,168
Sorry about my connection.

69
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:32,350
I'll try turning my video off, see if that helps.

70
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:38,508
Okay, great, great.

71
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:39,329
I'll leave it off then.

72
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:41,309
So we're working with Final Sight.

73
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:55,073
The actual website work gets shared among a few different people, but the two primary actors are me as the communications lead for the district, and our colleague, Lisa Miller.

74
00:05:55,233 --> 00:06:01,775
Lisa Miller is the web design and computer programming teacher on the vocational side at the high school.

75
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:06,937
So she's a full-time teacher, but she also has done a lot of really good work

76
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:08,717
building the new website.

77
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:17,660
And frankly, she's kind of the web design, the web architecture expert when putting the two of us side by side.

78
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:25,143
So I rely on her for a lot of the kind of engineering support on the website, and together we build things.

79
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:32,665
So the reason we don't have a draft of the building committee website ready is just because of her limited time.

80
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:36,147
But, you know, we're hoping to iron that out soon.

81
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:48,075
Now, I will share my screen so that I can point out a couple things on the existing website to let you know what I'm thinking about as we start this process.

82
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:49,576
That would be great.

83
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:49,896
Thanks.

84
00:06:58,742 --> 00:06:59,723
Are you able to share, Tom?

85
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:02,046
Yeah, I should be able to.

86
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:08,270
It's just taking a minute to decide if it's going to let me.

87
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:11,012
As these things tend to go.

88
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:15,975
Let's see.

89
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:18,057
Here we go.

90
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:23,260
So is everyone able to see my screen?

91
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:25,762
Yep.

92
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:26,992
Great.

93
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,655
So this is the school website.

94
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:35,578
We did secure a domain for the building committee website.

95
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:37,679
It's buildingmhs.org.

96
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,642
We picked up that domain.

97
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:41,382
It's ours.

98
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:49,027
We own a couple of the adjacent domains, .net, .info, to make it harder for

99
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:54,511
for unscrupulous people to make copycats to try to misdirect people.

100
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:57,594
So we do have buildingMHS.org.

101
00:07:58,274 --> 00:08:04,299
And that's what the URL will read when you're on the website.

102
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:15,668
But to show you an example of some of the things I'm thinking about, we're going to go to the school committee page, because I think there's some good models for what the initial draft of the website can look like.

103
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:21,374
So the way I see it, there's kind of three big things that we want to accomplish right away with the website.

104
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:30,904
First and foremost, given the activity of this committee and the flurry of meetings that we have, I think it's really important to set up a meetings page.

105
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:42,449
I think it would look a lot like this, where we'd be able to list meeting dates, include links to agendas, Zoom links, any associated documents with the meeting.

106
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,250
I think that's really important just from a transparency perspective.

107
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:57,641
And also to make it easier for members of the committee, because if you are jumping on a meeting, you need the agenda, you need the Zoom link, they can all be kind of in one place.

108
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:01,845
So I think this will be a really important thing to get set up right away.

109
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:08,732
And because we can basically copy the format of the school committee's meetings page, that'll be set up no problem.

110
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:13,604
We'll definitely have a news tab pretty quickly.

111
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:18,829
You know, right now our building committee news is still in school committee news.

112
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:29,317
It might remain there and get duplicated over into building committee news since the building committee is kind of an organ of the Medford School Committee.

113
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:36,683
But again, this would be a place where any of our news updates could all be kind of found in one place.

114
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,886
You know, we did a press release announcing that we had the first meeting

115
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,948
of the building committee last week.

116
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:45,872
So things like that would have a home there.

117
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:50,057
We're definitely going to need a space for documents.

118
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:54,642
There's a lot of different documents that the building committee is obviously developing.

119
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:58,286
As they're ready, we want to be able to share them with the public.

120
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:04,771
Again, in the interest of transparency and also to kind of document the work that we've done so far.

121
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:13,397
That might look something like one option certainly would be to kind of look like this budget page.

122
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:19,821
This is something that basically gives us a limited file navigator.

123
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:27,325
So we could have folders for different categories of documents and then links to the documents pretty readily available.

124
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,126
So I think it could look a lot like this page.

125
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:35,550
And then the final thing we'll need to do, all of you have submitted really nice bios and photos of yourself.

126
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:41,393
And I do think it's valuable and important to list out the membership of the committee

127
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:47,997
with those bios and, you know, kind of put a face to the work of this committee.

128
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,159
So that's the very fast version.

129
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:53,821
And I can stop sharing, I think.

130
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:57,803
That's kind of how I'm thinking about it.

131
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:10,351
You know, the first things we need to get through are a meeting page, documents page, news page, and a kind of about the committee page that includes the list of the members and their bios.

132
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:15,946
Luke, did I see that you had a question in the chat?

133
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:20,108
A recommendation.

134
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:21,649
Sure, go for it.

135
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:26,671
I've seen many of these websites and occasionally when they load.

136
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:33,159
The browser throws errors, suggesting that they're not secure.

137
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,626
So that's not common, but it happens.

138
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:43,314
Somerville is the one example I have on my mind, but I think there's others.

139
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:49,097
Whereas others, Belmont Stonehams, they load normally.

140
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:50,678
They don't throw any warnings.

141
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,682
And so I think there are basic best practices.

142
00:11:57,022 --> 00:12:00,625
And I just wanted to bring them up so that they're not forgotten.

143
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:02,466
We're still early.

144
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:03,487
We're setting this thing up.

145
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,409
And we just want to have that in mind.

146
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,651
We don't want to throw errors.

147
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:14,484
suggesting that this website has been compromised in some way.

148
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,831
We want people to feel like they're seeing the truth.

149
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,271
Yeah, that's a really good point, Luke.

150
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:29,797
And certainly the MPS main website uses HTTPS protocols, the secure URL protocols.

151
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:38,422
I would definitely make sure that building MHS.org is also going to be kind of fully secured and not raise any flags in that regard.

152
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:40,183
Because yeah, I agree.

153
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:42,204
One of the really important functions is to

154
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:49,294
not only to be the official repository of all this information we're gonna get up there, but also to look like.

155
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:50,895
I mean, that matters a lot.

156
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:52,956
Great, thanks.

157
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:55,787
Oh, go ahead, Nicole.

158
00:12:56,348 --> 00:12:56,968
Thanks, Jenny.

159
00:12:57,028 --> 00:13:01,691
I guess one thought I had, this looks great, and I think all these tabs make sense.

160
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:07,375
Just to Jenny's earlier point, is there thought as like getting a basic FAQ up kind of right away?

161
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:17,963
I know a lot of the frequently asked questions are already addressed, or at least partially addressed on the MSB website, whether we can pull those in, or just even have, you know, five to 10, like, what is this?

162
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,764
Like, why are we meeting?

163
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:20,745
Why are people meeting?

164
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:23,707
You know, very kind of basic stuff, since this is a little bit

165
00:13:24,593 --> 00:13:25,917
Not to say it's an opaque process.

166
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:29,508
Everything's on the website for MSBA, but most people don't know how this works.

167
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,491
Understandably so.

168
00:13:32,153 --> 00:13:33,313
Yeah, I agree.

169
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:37,094
I think that would make perfect sense to build out in the kind of initial spec.

170
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:48,016
And like you said, MSBA has so much information already available and our peer districts have already answered a lot of these questions too.

171
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:56,458
So yeah, I'll review some of the FAQs that MSBA has available and maybe that other districts have available, see what we want to pull over.

172
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:57,358
Great.

173
00:13:58,472 --> 00:13:59,053
Luke?

174
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:04,438
So along those lines, I've been thinking about what do you need at the start?

175
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:07,581
You need an idea of what the community wants to know.

176
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:10,483
FAQs are the responses to that.

177
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:18,571
But I thought to myself, what if we conducted a canvassing for some period, two weeks, three weeks?

178
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,772
I mean, we have time, right?

179
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,434
Our clock just started last week.

180
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:31,660
We just canvas the community and we say we put out a questionnaire, whether it's through a SurveyMonkey thing or through a Google Doc, and we open it up, see what comes in.

181
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,881
We may get a lot, we may get a little.

182
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,462
If we get a lot, it's actually pretty easy to process a lot.

183
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:41,025
And we see kind of what the most common questions are from our community.

184
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:48,772
And then we kind of cross-check that against FAQs from other building websites, from the MSBA.

185
00:14:50,433 --> 00:15:01,343
And then that way, we're addressing what our community wants, as well as, you know, maybe some of the process stuff that other websites have already addressed.

186
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:05,711
it would kind of dispel the whole cut and paste feel.

187
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:16,680
You know, if we see the exact same FAQ responses here as we do on the LSBA side, you know, it makes it feel like an empty gesture.

188
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:26,328
But if we, I think if we canvass the community and we ask, I think it will add a lot of, you know, goodwill to it.

189
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:30,091
And plus we'll have an understanding of what the community really wants to know.

190
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:42,763
I love that idea and it actually goes to sort of one of our other agenda items, which is like, what are those community engagement opportunities?

191
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:46,207
So we can definitely do that.

192
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:50,431
I think keeping it simple obviously makes it easier to execute on, but.

193
00:15:51,973 --> 00:16:04,183
based on what you're saying, Luke, the two things that I captured in terms of like, what we would want to know is like, what questions do you have about this building process?

194
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:13,611
And what are you looking for in a reimagined Medford High School?

195
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:14,312
Right?

196
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:19,016
I mean, are there other questions that you think would be important to

197
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:23,274
pose to folks?

198
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,115
Yeah.

199
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,297
What do you want to know about the eligibility process?

200
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,719
Because that's what we're doing right now.

201
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,060
We have a mission.

202
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:41,847
Granted, we have a strategy that is going to get us to a high school, but we actually have a tactical mission, and that's to complete this year with entry into feasibility.

203
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:53,223
There are aspects of the eligibility process that are unique to that process.

204
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,744
Once they're completed, you know, move on.

205
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:58,945
But people may want to know about what do we have in front of us this year?

206
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:01,666
What do we need to do as part of eligibility?

207
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:04,227
So that I think should be a question.

208
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:07,348
Like, what do you want to know about the eligibility process?

209
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:08,368
Sure.

210
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:15,303
Jenny, I'm one of their questions.

211
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:19,529
I'm going to actually I just realized I'm not sharing my screen so I'm I'm capturing all this as we talk.

212
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,291
So let me share my screen.

213
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:25,937
Can you see my screen?

214
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,623
Yes, OK, perfect Maria.

215
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:42,635
Yeah, one thing that I would like to see possibly is a statement about why we're undertaking this project because I've heard some people say the building is only 50 years old.

216
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,917
There are a lot of buildings in Metro, a lot of houses that are only 50 years old too.

217
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:54,239
And I think possibly a statement about what exactly the reason is that we're doing this project.

218
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,001
What are the failures of the building, the inadequacies,

219
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:10,063
I think that might be helpful, and especially in light of our current situation with funding, how we're going to go about this when we're facing all of these other shortfalls.

220
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:14,110
Sure, that's actually a great point.

221
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:21,375
Thomas and I had talked a little bit about like penning like a welcome on the page to just say like, welcome to this page.

222
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:22,796
This is what you can find here.

223
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:25,918
We're all really excited about this.

224
00:18:25,978 --> 00:18:35,805
So I think we could do, we could pull that like why into that landing page so that people can hear some of that as well.

225
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,448
And I think we'll get a lot of those FAQs in terms of like,

226
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:41,704
how will we pay for this?

227
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:51,049
And I actually think some of those answers are gonna start to like flush out really quickly, you know, in terms of like, how will we pay for the feasibility study?

228
00:18:51,550 --> 00:19:01,976
All those answers are gonna come really fast because we actually have a short window to set aside our feasibility money here in Medford because free cash will be available only until June 30.

229
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:05,718
So we will need to get that done before June 30.

230
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,279
So, you know, we will have,

231
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:23,618
you know, if the plan continues to be to use free cash, we will have to get a favorable vote from the council to move that money earmarked into this, into the, oh my God, what's the word I'm looking for?

232
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:30,522
Sustainability fund, oh yeah, it starts with an S, stability fund, thank you.

233
00:19:33,697 --> 00:19:37,562
into the stability fund before June 30 so that it is there and ready to go.

234
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:40,266
Stabilization.

235
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:40,947
Yes, thank you.

236
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:45,472
I think there will be a lot of good questions about that along the way.

237
00:19:48,293 --> 00:20:00,523
I do like the idea of asking people what they want to know before we push out just a pile of FAQs, because I think we can anticipate reasonably the questions people have.

238
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:01,744
This committee is 25 people.

239
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:04,586
I think we have a good perspective on that.

240
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:14,294
But to the point of community engagement, I think I want to hear from people first before we start telling them what questions we think that they have.

241
00:20:15,988 --> 00:20:24,531
Yeah, and I think that helps just keep the number manageable too, because if you're putting down like 30 FAQs, people just check out and can't find what they want anyways.

242
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:25,071
Right.

243
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:31,033
So I have three questions.

244
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:35,374
What questions do you have about the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee?

245
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:38,876
What questions do you have about the MSBA eligibility process?

246
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:42,237
And this is not a full question.

247
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:53,757
What do you want to see in a reimagined MHS?

248
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:56,059
How's that?

249
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:05,786
Do we want to know, you know, we do a lot of surveying where we're collecting demographic information.

250
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:05,886
Luke?

251
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:14,261
So for the last one, I like the spirit of it, but you're just going to get a lot of answers.

252
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:29,476
And for the FAQ, and I think that's a question to ask, but for the FAQ, maybe frame it as, you know, like,

253
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:35,739
what questions would you have about the reimagined high school?

254
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:38,580
Because we want to produce questions.

255
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:42,841
Sorry, I might be hyper-focusing on one.

256
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:55,285
I think we can probably do both, ask, try to inform the FAQ, and start to get people excited about what might this look like in the end.

257
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:59,366
I was able to take a tour of Arlington High School.

258
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:09,357
They just had stuff that certainly I didn't have when I went to high school and MHS doesn't have.

259
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:16,299
They had a room, they called it the discourse room and had discourse on the wall.

260
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:25,182
It was like a shared classroom space where multiple classrooms could convene together and do things like have debates.

261
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:29,383
It's set up in a fashion that facilitates that.

262
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:47,569
And of course, the principles like here's the one thing I don't like about this room, but in general, it was like the idea of like collaboration space for classrooms to work together was I was just like, oh, if you asked me what I wanted in a building, I never could have described that because it's beyond.

263
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:52,172
anything I've seen, and I don't work in schools every single day.

264
00:22:52,232 --> 00:23:05,441
So there's stuff like that where I think asking people what they want to see is going to give us some really fascinating ideas because people in Medford have been everywhere and have all kinds of different experiences.

265
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:09,284
And it might just give us some good food for thought to help us inform the

266
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:16,727
educational profile, like ask as well, which I think is pretty exciting.

267
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,408
I think I'm tracking now.

268
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:25,374
And so now I'm starting to imagine the questionnaire as two way communication, right?

269
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:30,818
So we're asking you community for questions that you have about all this.

270
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:34,060
But we're also going to ask you a question.

271
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:35,261
What do you want to see?

272
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:40,804
And if you structure it that way and almost break out the third question as a separate thing, here's a question to you.

273
00:23:40,824 --> 00:23:43,525
I think that could work.

274
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:45,566
And I think people would really enjoy that.

275
00:23:46,346 --> 00:23:50,248
And there might be some people that really just want to talk about what they want to see.

276
00:23:50,368 --> 00:23:55,191
And they may not even give us any useful questions, whereas you might find these other sort of like,

277
00:23:55,971 --> 00:24:03,654
I don't know, more procedural process driven people who have a lot of questions about how are you going to get from point A to point B to C and so on.

278
00:24:04,294 --> 00:24:16,358
And so structuring that way as almost two separate sections in a short questionnaire could be really effective in getting like broader engagement.

279
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:54,209
That looks awesome to me, but what are others on the committee think?

280
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:11,132
I mean, there's one possibility, and not to narrow it right out the gate, but we could do multiple choice, right?

281
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:17,256
I mean, we could, you know, pull kind of broadly about what the community priorities are.

282
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:21,378
Is the priority a sustainable net zero emissions building?

283
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,741
Is the priority a building that includes community spaces?

284
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:26,682
Is the priority

285
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,952
really, really big vocational spaces that allow us to expand voc programs.

286
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:44,076
That could be one kind of question, but I also see a lot of value in keeping it open-ended, so I'm not married to that, but wanted to raise it as an alternative.

287
00:25:48,142 --> 00:25:55,305
One thing that I think people may ask right off the bat is what is a comprehensive school?

288
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:57,726
Most people do not know what that is.

289
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:00,728
So we're calling it this comprehensive high school.

290
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:03,809
How could they even answer the question if they don't know what that is?

291
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:11,373
Yeah, we can give it a little bit of a preamble.

292
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:39,995
And we can include a link to the statement of interest as well if somebody really wants to dive in.

293
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:46,073
Yeah, it's true.

294
00:26:46,093 --> 00:26:47,954
I don't think a lot of people know that's available.

295
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:53,176
Well, I mean, some do, but I don't know if there's broad awareness that the SOI is now posted.

296
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,257
And it's not just the SOI.

297
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:59,198
There's the results of the environmental building conditions survey.

298
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:02,779
There were two separate studies done there, which was actually really important.

299
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:04,400
That helped the SOI tremendously.

300
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,583
Yeah, and all of that is available.

301
00:27:08,303 --> 00:27:10,345
And I think people should know that it's there.

302
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:15,890
And when they see this survey, that might be the first time that they realize, oh, I can go take a look at this.

303
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:16,851
Right.

304
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:18,413
Nicole.

305
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:32,430
Yeah, I think I think this looks good and I think it's just helpful to think of as far as like the whole ecosystem of stuff we're going to do for engagement and asking these questions because it's just like if this is just like our preliminary or 1st pass.

306
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,013
I think it's great and we don't it doesn't have to.

307
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:37,696
address every single thought.

308
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:47,723
I know this was like spurred by the idea of FAQs and then we kind of, it's already evolving, but then just thinking like, are we, you know, how many other surveys or other outreach things are we doing?

309
00:27:47,763 --> 00:28:04,976
So just like, we don't have to necessarily have this address every single concern question we have right now, but also understanding how many more or what other ways or what specific topic-based surveys or outreach we'll be putting out there.

310
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:09,976
Yes, that's a good.

311
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:10,837
Yeah, those are good questions.

312
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:10,877
I

313
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:41,426
Something like that.

314
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:46,549
Click any of these that apply.

315
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:53,273
Yeah.

316
00:28:59,216 --> 00:28:59,436
Cool.

317
00:28:59,816 --> 00:28:59,856
OK.

318
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:13,985
I guess the other sort of question sort of to zoom out from like the survey, which I think is a great idea to start to get people familiar with what's happening.

319
00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:29,348
I wanted to talk a little bit with this group about other things we should be thinking about doing during this eligibility phase to draw in and keep the community informed.

320
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:36,697
I don't know if anybody has thoughts on like things they've seen other committees do in this phase or ideas.

321
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:46,221
Like I think, you know, the obvious thing is like, I think at some point we should offer some tours of MHS because there's plenty of people who have never been inside MHS.

322
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:55,505
And, you know, there's plenty of people who have been inside MHS, but it's been, you know, many years or, you know,

323
00:29:56,955 --> 00:29:58,536
you know, or something else entirely.

324
00:29:58,616 --> 00:30:04,521
So we may wanna sort of think about some tour dates of Medford High School.

325
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:20,355
And I don't think that necessarily has to be like in the next like gauntlet of 60 days, because the next 60 days are like very sort of brutal in terms of calendars, but we could even schedule them for the fall and think about, you know, what do we wanna see in those tours?

326
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:26,465
Um, but that's just like one thought that I had in terms of like obvious engagement things.

327
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:29,849
Um, wasn't sure if anybody had any other thoughts about that.

328
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:32,792
And when you say this phase, this is the phase that goes until January.

329
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:33,513
Yep.

330
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:34,294
Okay.

331
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:39,239
I, like I said, my big goal is that we're done long before January, but even if we are like,

332
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:42,876
There's no building before January, so we have time.

333
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:56,699
Maybe we could ask some of the Media Tech students to do some video tours that could be attached to the website and show them some of the spaces.

334
00:30:56,719 --> 00:31:00,880
Because a lot of people can't get in there, especially older people.

335
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,581
That building isn't handicap friendly.

336
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:07,382
So maybe video tours as well.

337
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:09,002
That's a great idea.

338
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:13,036
So Nicole's got her hand up, but then I want to go afterwards.

339
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:15,439
I can figure out how to do the hand raise and zoom.

340
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,441
It's in the reactions.

341
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:18,563
It's in the reactions.

342
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,564
It's hidden.

343
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:20,906
Nicole?

344
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,169
Just a thought as far as like, I know

345
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:44,028
online tends to be, of course, all this stuff is going to exist online, but directing folks there, if there is a thought of like some physical signage, whether it's like stuff that can literally be like at city hall with a QR code or on like, you know, we could even do like, if there's budget for just like some lawn signs that could be on some public spaces with a QR code where people can then find out.

346
00:31:44,088 --> 00:31:52,795
Cause if people aren't on Facebook or all the usual channels, we could have all this beautiful information and people, you know, a certain subset of people will still have no clue.

347
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:54,056
Right.

348
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,326
Okay, on loop.

349
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:07,789
Maria, I really like your idea.

350
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:12,670
Now, have you ever seen those before and after photo?

351
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:34,038
It's almost like this like unique little subculture where people sort of try to copy like a picture they took together like 30 years ago, but in the present, you know, so you'll have like a brother and a sister kind of sitting side by side on a swing when they're four, and then they try to recreate that when they're 40, that sort of thing.

352
00:32:34,758 --> 00:32:44,442
So kind of along those lines, there's actually a video and it's available through the library and it was filmed in 1970.

353
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:53,847
And it is like a tour through the school and like there's cuts, you know, between one building to one room to the next.

354
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:55,648
They talk about, you know, this great new

355
00:32:57,028 --> 00:32:59,690
like woodshop area, they talk about the cafeteria.

356
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:08,515
Wouldn't it be cool if there is a media tech team that they try to recreate that and show us what it looks like today?

357
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,897
Then we have the two videos.

358
00:33:12,578 --> 00:33:20,643
In some cases, it'll be amusing, but in other cases, I bet it'll lead to almost shocking reflections of

359
00:33:21,688 --> 00:33:27,317
I can't believe it still looks the same way and maybe it doesn't even work anymore.

360
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:28,439
You know what I mean?

361
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:31,664
The comparisons could be stark in some cases.

362
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:35,137
Yeah, I think that sounds amazing.

363
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:38,740
Actually, the thing that comes to mind is the theater.

364
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,664
Like, I imagine when it was built, it was like the bee's knees, right?

365
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:47,527
Like, it's like an amazing theater with all this technology.

366
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:56,254
And now if you talk to the Medford High drama students who just put on a show, they're like, why can you only hear one voice at a time?

367
00:33:56,815 --> 00:34:00,137
And it's because the technology is dated and it's, that's,

368
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:02,280
sort of all it's capable of, right?

369
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:08,045
So I think that could be such a cool, fun, creative project.

370
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:21,199
And we have a media tech group of students who I'm sure could do some pretty amazing things with that concept, especially if there is this video from the 70s.

371
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,140
That could be very cool.

372
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:31,972
Yeah, I don't know who to send the link to, but I the videos out there and the library has posted it on their website.

373
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:33,373
Do you have it handy.

374
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:37,114
I mean, I could post it in the chat.

375
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:43,496
Yeah, just post it in the chat and I will throw it in this document so that we don't lose it on the side and then I'll post it in the chat.

376
00:34:45,537 --> 00:34:46,597
Um, um,

377
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:57,914
I don't know if this would be useful, but I'm having all of our yearbooks digitized.

378
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:13,157
And while I was going through all of the stuff that I have to get ready for that process, I came across the newspaper, the Mustang newspaper that was dedicated to the fire of the old building.

379
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:19,039
And it has a lot of pictures in there of that older building, including all of the damages.

380
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,940
And I don't know if you are thinking about an historical perspective.

381
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,261
That might be interesting to include some of those pictures as well.

382
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,482
But just wanted to let you know, I have that.

383
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:30,542
OK.

384
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,322
All right.

385
00:35:32,522 --> 00:35:33,423
Actually, a ton.

386
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:42,778
So long ago, when I first got really interested and kind of terrified, I went to the library.

387
00:35:42,798 --> 00:35:49,841
And this is like, I think, after I read the first, yeah, there was an SOI before this current one.

388
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:54,183
After I read that one, I thought, oh, you know, I need to get a better idea of kind of,

389
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,081
all the sort of relevant aspects.

390
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:01,781
And so I went to the library and I spent hours in there.

391
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:07,923
And it is phenomenal how many press clippings they have and flyers.

392
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:21,686
And you can actually piece together the sequence of meetings, the community-wide decisions, a whole number of things from press articles.

393
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:24,947
There was like a Mercury, Medford Mercury.

394
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:37,617
And I bet if you went to one of the librarians and asked for the folder that she had, well actually I don't know if you saw it, but they definitely have the material.

395
00:36:38,337 --> 00:36:41,380
She handed me a folder, like she actually had a dedicated thing, because I,

396
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,961
I called her ahead of time and I told her I wanted to research the high school.

397
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:48,001
And so she put this whole thing together.

398
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:49,661
I wonder if she still has it.

399
00:36:51,682 --> 00:36:54,122
It was like the head of the head librarian.

400
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:59,983
This is back when they were like the library and they had all their materials on Boston Ave.

401
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:03,944
So I had to go to Boston Ave and but it's it's thick.

402
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,504
It's like, you know, six to eight inches thick.

403
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:11,165
It's like this folder opens up and it's just like clipping after clipping after clipping.

404
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:12,165
There's a lot of material there.

405
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:20,719
Awesome.

406
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:25,974
Cool.

407
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:26,776
All right.

408
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:27,337
I love it.

409
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:29,442
What else?

410
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:40,452
The other sort of related communication piece for the eligibility phase, I thought, was during the application process.

411
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:51,722
We got some notes from some of our various boards and commissions and people who applied who said, I am on this board or commission in Medford.

412
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:54,304
And I think you need to be connected to them.

413
00:37:54,424 --> 00:38:04,667
So I think the other thing I'm interested in talking about from an engagement perspective is, who are those boards and commissions that we should be thinking about reaching out to?

414
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:11,449
And do we maybe do some outreach to them to say, here's roughly what the process looks like?

415
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:30,192
tell us what the you tell us what the right time is to be connected to you or have a conversation with us so we can figure that out because I don't think everybody is going to be interested in all of the phases but you know and there may be some commissions that are not

416
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:47,444
so directly connected at all, but there are probably many that are connected and might want to be starting to think about their place in this process as an independent commission from the school building committee.

417
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:52,606
I don't know if maybe our short-term approach is just to

418
00:38:55,273 --> 00:39:06,995
survey them separately with a separate set of questions, or if you all have any other thoughts about how we might engage with our boards and commissions.

419
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:12,972
I think that makes sense because I think my thought was like doing like a roadshow.

420
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:16,633
But to your point, not everything is going to be relevant to everybody.

421
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:23,735
And we also don't want to exhaust the resources of the volunteers, but, you know, in a very long process.

422
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:30,978
So, yeah, I think finding out where what are different commissions or maybe dial in or be interested in an update and then using folks to.

423
00:39:32,098 --> 00:39:37,124
You know, you have like a decided upon presentation or something and having different representatives be there.

424
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:37,724
Hopefully.

425
00:39:38,365 --> 00:39:42,370
Hopefully we could do that in a way where it's not like, always, you know, Jenny Graham going to 16.

426
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:47,555
But we can have different volunteers from the committee go to different commissions and committees.

427
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:52,281
Yeah, I mean, we certainly can develop a roadshow presentation that.

428
00:39:53,705 --> 00:40:00,716
you know, we can just like sort of pick it up off the shelf and send somebody to the meeting, but they have like that assistive support.

429
00:40:00,756 --> 00:40:04,061
So I think that makes a lot of sense as well.

430
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:31,381
The board that I am on, that's a summer camp board, we had done like a whole master planning exercise and we had created like a roadshow presentation that we put on in a couple of different, like, you know, we announced it in a couple of different places to say like, oh, this one's going to be focused on that, this one's going to be focused on that, and then people either called in or showed up to those specific events.

431
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:34,954
presentations, depending on whether or not they were interested.

432
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:46,683
So instead of us going out to 16 different locations, is there a way to bring people together, like four or five?

433
00:40:47,604 --> 00:41:01,094
So Marissa, are you thinking like we hold like, you know, a summer meeting or something that invites all of our boards and commissions to come in here like an info presentation to sort of warm?

434
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:01,595
Yeah, I mean,

435
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:18,799
maybe, or maybe there's like, after the survey, there's a way to kind of bring to cluster them together in a way that it's not 16 different presentations, it's four presentations to like a differing number of people, or a different number of groups.

436
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,421
Okay.

437
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,380
Okay, so we were thinking about surveying boards and commissions.

438
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:48,444
Does your board or mission have a topical interest?

439
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:49,564
Is that the right word?

440
00:41:49,624 --> 00:41:54,766
A topical interest in the school building committee?

441
00:42:08,672 --> 00:42:10,890
Is that the right, it feels clunky but.

442
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:56,100
multiple choice there just so we don't get a million different answers.

443
00:42:58,021 --> 00:42:59,621
Is it topical or professional?

444
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:07,545
Or is it public?

445
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:16,826
Do our boards and commissions have like a scope or like a charter or something?

446
00:43:17,286 --> 00:43:21,348
Some of them are explicitly outlined in the charter and others are ad hoc.

447
00:43:22,068 --> 00:43:22,389
OK.

448
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:28,231
Is it maybe just like an overlapping interest?

449
00:43:31,232 --> 00:43:32,013
I'm sorry, Marissa.

450
00:43:32,033 --> 00:43:33,133
Can you repeat that again?

451
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,855
Is it maybe, yeah, overlapping interest?

452
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:43,069
Yeah, overlapping.

453
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,496
I was thinking aligning interests or alignment.

454
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:50,200
Something along those lines.

455
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,845
So I think topical is just like, I heard about it.

456
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:53,385
Yeah.

457
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:53,806
Okay.

458
00:43:58,551 --> 00:43:59,512
I like overlapping.

459
00:43:59,952 --> 00:44:04,455
It's either overlapping and or aligned.

460
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:13,741
I'm imagining we're going to want to talk to the Bicycle Commission and Walk Medford and the Disability Commission.

461
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:20,805
There's lots of them, and they all have different things that they probably want to weigh in on and be part of.

462
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,466
OK.

463
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:37,876
And then what is the best way to reach you?

464
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:45,404
And do you have any questions for?

465
00:45:00,486 --> 00:45:04,728
Okay.

466
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:10,091
Other thoughts on like near-range community engagement?

467
00:45:11,691 --> 00:45:18,174
The other things that I've sort of been thinking about, there are, like I said, was it just last week?

468
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:24,969
There are some things that are sort of the purview of the school committee to decide.

469
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:34,515
So for example, will we be going after expanded vocational programming?

470
00:45:34,856 --> 00:45:35,996
And if so, which ones?

471
00:45:36,617 --> 00:45:40,380
And that presentation is scheduled to come to the school committee, I believe, on the 20th.

472
00:45:42,737 --> 00:45:47,359
And so there's some overlap will certainly want to make sure that school building committee members know that that's happening.

473
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,101
But that will inform the chapter 74.

474
00:45:53,781 --> 00:45:55,422
document that we need to fill out.

475
00:45:56,603 --> 00:46:05,990
Because if we say, yes, we want to have a new program and it needs to have this kind of capacity, it needs to go on our chapter 74 form in order to be part of the process at all.

476
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:08,892
So there's some, I think, some things like that.

477
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:14,296
And Curtis Tufts, the co-location of Curtis Tufts,

478
00:46:15,957 --> 00:46:17,699
where we have some subcommittee meetings scheduled.

479
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:32,612
And I think the other big topic where that might happen is when we talk about all of our early childhood programming and any sort of changes there, which I think the administration is still sort of working through.

480
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:39,899
But there are some things like that as well that like the way to sort of know what's going on is,

481
00:46:41,340 --> 00:47:08,482
maybe not just like just tuning into the school building committee but also there's some like topical things that are going to happen outside of that so i'm just wondering if um thomas maybe we need to think about framing some sort of like periodic update about those kinds of things into the superintendent's weekly memo so that if there is something like that where it's like sort of crossover related that we can describe it

482
00:47:10,433 --> 00:47:11,995
Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.

483
00:47:12,215 --> 00:47:19,343
I mean, the nice thing about the superintendent's weekly memo is that it hits every family in the district.

484
00:47:19,424 --> 00:47:24,269
So it covers our school community really well.

485
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,412
It does not necessarily get to the wider community.

486
00:47:27,173 --> 00:47:29,794
Yeah, so I was just about to say that.

487
00:47:30,034 --> 00:47:32,215
My children aren't old enough to be in school yet.

488
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:35,096
And so we do not get that information.

489
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:39,918
But I obviously have two young children, and this is important to me.

490
00:47:39,978 --> 00:47:47,841
And a lot of the families that have asked me about this so far do not have kids that are old enough to be in school yet.

491
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:51,103
So getting the information out, yeah.

492
00:47:51,363 --> 00:47:53,944
Yeah, we need to be creative about that.

493
00:47:55,243 --> 00:48:00,308
about how to kind of collect that audience with time.

494
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:09,298
Do we create a separate mail list, Tom, for people who are specifically interested in the process?

495
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:19,375
Yeah, one of the pieces of functionality that our website has is that you can sign up for automatic updates when a news post is added.

496
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:24,377
And so we could have that set up for just the building committee section too.

497
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:31,780
And that would cover anything that we share in terms of meetings, press releases, updates.

498
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:42,767
Likewise, we do have individuals sometimes sign up for the superintendent's memos and the other district news through that, even if they don't have children in the system yet.

499
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:48,391
Ultimately, we'll want a list of some form.

500
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:50,452
I think it's just a question of how we gather it.

501
00:48:51,253 --> 00:48:51,533
OK.

502
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:54,035
Marissa, did you have another question?

503
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,350
I did, yes.

504
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:05,052
So I think the main question, this kind of off of what we were talking about, but the biggest thing that people have been asking me also is what is the timeline?

505
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:13,754
And like, I know that we don't know the timeline, because, you know, there's all these different things, you know, there's so many, so many factors involved in it.

506
00:49:14,174 --> 00:49:22,676
But is there a way that we can convey some type of like graphic representation of the timeline, similar to that little diagram that you had pulled out?

507
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:24,057
That's like, here's where we are.

508
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:25,217
And here's where we go next.

509
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:40,024
that could be, like, circulated through the community so that people have a bit of an understanding about, like, what the steps are and what the overarching, like, you know, this could take six months or this could take a year.

510
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:51,449
Like, I don't know if we want to pin any actual timeline, period of concrete time to it, but is there a way to visually represent this process?

511
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:56,584
Okay.

512
00:49:58,586 --> 00:49:58,826
Luke?

513
00:50:02,128 --> 00:50:08,693
Yeah, so I just wanted to kind of make the caution, and I agree with a lot of what's been said.

514
00:50:09,614 --> 00:50:13,157
We, in this phase of the process, need to be careful about not

515
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:19,371
sort of cultivating the perception that we're making any promises for things.

516
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:22,973
We want to listen to everybody, but we're really, really early on.

517
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:33,861
And there might be some things that we can't do or some things that are just, we don't want to give anybody the wrong idea.

518
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:35,181
We want to listen.

519
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:36,983
We want to collect.

520
00:50:38,424 --> 00:50:42,586
And so I think in eligibility, that's important.

521
00:50:44,574 --> 00:51:03,575
To Marissa's point about how long it takes, no one's got a crystal ball, can't predict how much or how long this particular project is going to last and like our performance through the gates, but we certainly have a trove of evidence from other schools that have

522
00:51:04,556 --> 00:51:07,379
conducted this process, and it's measurable.

523
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:11,262
It takes a little bit of effort, and I've actually done some of it on my own.

524
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,304
It's just like a press releases.

525
00:51:14,025 --> 00:51:29,920
Everybody announces when they're accepted, everyone announces when they move to the next phase, and then it's just simple math, and if you do it across enough communities, you can sort of get a rough picture of how fast you can go through it if it's a pitch-perfect game, and how long it could potentially go if there's

526
00:51:30,941 --> 00:51:37,787
deep-rooted acrimony because there's examples of both.

527
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:51,420
I don't know necessarily if we want to have that kind of data science results posted on our website, but it's certainly something that almost anybody could do.

528
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,902
But I just

529
00:51:54,755 --> 00:51:58,016
But it gets to sort of the making promises.

530
00:51:58,036 --> 00:52:05,477
Because if you post the graph and the bell curve is like, we should get through this in seven years, then it almost implies that we're promising that.

531
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,937
And we just don't know.

532
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:08,037
I would love to.

533
00:52:09,218 --> 00:52:10,558
And that's why I volunteer.

534
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:15,059
I want to help as much as I can so that we get as close to that as possible.

535
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,359
Yeah.

536
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:22,520
I think we could probably create a pretty simple and not

537
00:52:23,522 --> 00:52:33,792
grainy graphic, like I just copied and pasted them off of the MSBA website, but they're not even like in the MSBA website in such a way that it really lends to that in a high quality way.

538
00:52:33,872 --> 00:52:39,698
So I think we could just create something pretty simple that would show people what the steps are.

539
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,982
And we could just be like,

540
00:52:44,846 --> 00:52:46,508
here's where we are right now.

541
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:47,169
We are here.

542
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:52,033
We'll let you know when we go to the next step and whatever it is.

543
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:57,318
I think that would be pretty simple to do without, I think to your point, making promises.

544
00:52:57,338 --> 00:53:02,704
I know.

545
00:53:04,545 --> 00:53:08,990
Other thoughts about

546
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:10,857
community engagement.

547
00:53:10,977 --> 00:53:14,299
I think we have like a really nice list here so far.

548
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:28,487
Yeah, I mean, I think there's the option of attending community events or just I'm thinking like the farmers market or something doesn't have to obviously be every week, but just let people know this is happening and how they can learn more and get involved.

549
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:43,393
Yeah, if they do that summer concert series as well, there's like the family concert series.

550
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:45,133
That would be a great place to have a little table.

551
00:53:45,153 --> 00:53:51,434
Yeah.

552
00:53:51,454 --> 00:53:51,494
OK.

553
00:53:51,834 --> 00:53:52,194
Sorry.

554
00:53:53,715 --> 00:53:54,295
Share again.

555
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:56,675
We can move on maybe to the next question.

556
00:53:56,715 --> 00:53:58,156
So I'm just keeping a list here.

557
00:54:02,396 --> 00:54:03,277
Can you see my screen again?

558
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:04,877
Mm-hmm.

559
00:54:04,897 --> 00:54:04,977
OK.

560
00:54:06,357 --> 00:54:23,543
Um, and, um, you know, any of the, um, forgetting what the, like, not circle the square, but that's another one.

561
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:34,466
Um, there's another big fest down in the summer in Meffert square.

562
00:54:36,008 --> 00:54:37,208
that the chamber puts on.

563
00:54:37,228 --> 00:54:38,889
I'm just trying to remember what it is.

564
00:54:39,749 --> 00:54:41,069
The Clippership one?

565
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:41,970
I can't think either.

566
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,910
Is it Clippership Day?

567
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:45,691
Something like that.

568
00:54:46,531 --> 00:54:48,211
I know I ended up in the dunk tank one year.

569
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:49,012
That's all I remember.

570
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:54,533
I'll put Clippership Day, but we can find it.

571
00:54:55,173 --> 00:54:55,273
OK.

572
00:54:56,174 --> 00:54:56,954
I think that makes sense.

573
00:54:59,694 --> 00:55:03,936
And then the last item on our agenda for tonight,

574
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,794
just applaud us in advance for moving.

575
00:55:10,362 --> 00:55:14,804
amazingly fast through this agenda, because I know everyone has places to go and things to do.

576
00:55:14,904 --> 00:55:23,266
So one of the questions that we'll have to answer in the educational profile is this question.

577
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:31,029
So it says, describe the community outreach that has occurred to this point and any future plans and goals related to engaging the community on the Medford High School project.

578
00:55:31,609 --> 00:55:38,572
If considering grade reconfiguration, consolidation of facilities, and or a change to the current teaching methodology,

579
00:55:39,192 --> 00:55:39,712
that we've had in the past.

580
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:39,772
Um.

581
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:44,834
Describe the outreach and discussions that have occurred to this point in any future plans to engage the community on the proposed changes.

582
00:55:45,614 --> 00:55:51,636
Additionally indicate whether the district has determined whether or not override or debt exclusion might be required for full project funding.

583
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:54,177
So I think.

584
00:55:56,378 --> 00:56:01,099
If we get sort of broad agreement on all the things that we described up above.

585
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,060
That is our community

586
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:21,666
I don't believe that we are considering grade reconfiguration or massive changes to the teaching methodology, again, with those few exceptions.

587
00:56:21,706 --> 00:56:31,911
So in this section, we can point to those community discussions happening at school committee and those approvals here in terms of other touch points of community engagement.

588
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:41,954
The final piece is indicating whether we've determined if we will need an override or a debt exclusion for full project funding.

589
00:56:41,994 --> 00:56:45,775
And I will check with the mayor, but I believe the answer is yes.

590
00:56:47,515 --> 00:56:50,356
I don't think this kind of project gets done without that.

591
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:57,477
But I just wanted to put this question out there just to get the juices flowing and have you all think about anything that you want to add.

592
00:56:57,758 --> 00:56:57,978
Luke?

593
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:03,899
Oh, you're on mute.

594
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:08,095
I just want to introduce a process check here.

595
00:57:08,115 --> 00:57:17,620
These are specific, the grade reconfiguration consolidation facilities changed current methodology.

596
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,301
That's a specific question from the profile, yeah.

597
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:24,023
No, no, there are specific terms that I think probably appear in the SOI.

598
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:27,205
And so whatever answers we come up with, we should cross-check.

599
00:57:27,385 --> 00:57:28,585
So that's the process check.

600
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:30,946
We have to make sure it's consistent.

601
00:57:33,528 --> 00:57:33,608
OK.

602
00:57:58,802 --> 00:58:00,323
Any other thoughts?

603
00:58:14,595 --> 00:58:25,524
I also just wanted to make sure that we do have a member of the community on, and I don't want to put you on the spot, but if you wanted to contribute to the conversation, you're very welcome to do so.

604
00:58:25,604 --> 00:58:28,366
It's a small group, so we'd love to hear from you as well.

605
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:36,213
I think that's probably me.

606
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:36,813
Hi.

607
00:58:37,553 --> 00:58:37,933
Thank you.

608
00:58:38,113 --> 00:58:41,494
I'm merely here as an observer, so I appreciate you calling it out.

609
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:44,875
I just want to respect the committee doing their process.

610
00:58:46,215 --> 00:58:49,836
I'm just checking in to see what's happening here.

611
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:50,837
So thank you all.

612
00:58:51,757 --> 00:58:57,098
We're all excited and anxious and looking forward to the best outcome here.

613
00:58:57,178 --> 00:59:01,519
So I will fade to the back again and let you guys carry on.

614
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,300
But thank you all for your work in this space.

615
00:59:04,473 --> 00:59:04,914
You're welcome.

616
00:59:04,994 --> 00:59:06,077
How old are your littles now?

617
00:59:06,097 --> 00:59:06,398
Thank you.

618
00:59:07,621 --> 00:59:09,766
I've got I've got one little guy.

619
00:59:09,787 --> 00:59:11,571
He is in third grade, OK?

620
00:59:14,148 --> 00:59:17,511
When I knocked on your door, he was like, ready for the kindergarten.

621
00:59:18,072 --> 00:59:20,173
Yeah, and Luke was his coach.

622
00:59:20,193 --> 00:59:24,317
I was going to say, it's Logan, right?

623
00:59:24,357 --> 00:59:24,657
Yeah.

624
00:59:24,717 --> 00:59:31,243
Small world, of course, in Bedford here, but there are many who have a vested interest here.

625
00:59:31,303 --> 00:59:38,389
I'm just one who happens to have a couple of minutes tonight to sit in and listen to you guys do your work.

626
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,450
Thank you for all you're doing.

627
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,732
You're welcome.

628
00:59:42,397 --> 00:59:46,440
Marissa, did you have your hand in the air, or did I hear you come off mute?

629
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,381
I just want to make sure we didn't lose you.

630
00:59:48,461 --> 00:59:50,082
Yeah, I did it by mistake.

631
00:59:50,562 --> 00:59:52,724
All of my kids are running around all over the place.

632
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:54,925
It's a little chaotic in the background.

633
00:59:54,945 --> 00:59:58,488
OK.

634
00:59:59,989 --> 01:00:01,710
So let's go.

635
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:07,534
I just want to go back to the top and find out if there's anybody who wants to spearhead any of these.

636
01:00:08,825 --> 01:00:11,768
items, it's okay if that's not immediately obvious.

637
01:00:11,848 --> 01:00:15,431
Like, I think some of the communication stuff Tom can work on on our behalf.

638
01:00:16,773 --> 01:00:32,848
But I didn't know if there was anything else that anybody was like, I definitely want to be involved in that project, or that initiative, because if you do, we want to make sure that you can do that.

639
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:44,223
I mean, I'm happy to be tagged in as a support for anything that's explicitly comms related, since that's my wheelhouse, among other wheelhouses.

640
01:00:44,323 --> 01:00:45,904
But that's what I do during the day.

641
01:00:45,924 --> 01:00:49,907
Do you think you could help me with the roadshow presentation?

642
01:00:50,448 --> 01:00:50,648
Yeah.

643
01:00:54,591 --> 01:01:03,338
I am happy to help with graphics and putting slides and presentations together or generating new imagery or anything like that.

644
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:09,487
Great.

645
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:20,853
Anything else?

646
01:01:20,913 --> 01:01:31,338
Is there somebody who is interested in taking on identifying these events where we might have some tables and some information?

647
01:01:35,604 --> 01:01:37,466
I could look at that, Jenny.

648
01:01:37,526 --> 01:01:38,167
I could look at that.

649
01:01:38,868 --> 01:01:51,823
I was also thinking, and it's pretty specific, about if we're doing polls, we should probably be polling the faculty to get their input and to see what their suggestions are.

650
01:01:58,602 --> 01:02:04,187
That's a great point, especially where we actually know that we can get in touch with all the faculty too.

651
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:07,891
That's a list we already have, which is great.

652
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:19,911
Yeah, and before this all got started, the principal, Principal Cabral asked me to come and do a presentation in one of her staff meetings.

653
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:27,397
And it was one of those like choose your own adventure staff meetings where there are like many things going on and people could sort of pick how they wanted to use their time.

654
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:37,244
And now that you're saying that Maria, I remember that somebody was like, are you recording this so that other people who aren't here, was it you?

655
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:43,330
And I think I said something like maybe I should give this a test run before I do a recording.

656
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:48,655
But to that point, like I may reach out to Ms.

657
01:02:48,675 --> 01:03:03,228
Cabral again and see if she wants to host another one that we might record so that as we head into the summer that the folks who work in the building every single day have some sort of like extra touch point.

658
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,892
And I'll say for myself, I'm willing to devote time.

659
01:03:15,912 --> 01:03:19,093
I feel obligated to devote time to helping where I can.

660
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:24,316
But I have three kids on five soccer teams.

661
01:03:27,257 --> 01:03:28,018
It's a real problem.

662
01:03:28,698 --> 01:03:35,141
And so what I do, it needs to be time flexible.

663
01:03:35,381 --> 01:03:36,242
I work on weekends.

664
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:39,263
So if there's things that can be done,

665
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,643
you know, odd hours, I'm happy to do those.

666
01:03:47,943 --> 01:03:57,289
I may not be available to sit at a table or attend a meeting, but certainly, you know, I want to pitch in.

667
01:03:58,249 --> 01:04:09,135
Folks identify areas that, you know, involve research or writing something up, like we do on a Saturday, that would be most helpful.

668
01:04:09,796 --> 01:04:11,117
How would you feel about

669
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:20,313
taking on the work of collecting these responses and when we get the survey responses back and trying to make some sense of them.

670
01:04:20,853 --> 01:04:21,334
Absolutely.

671
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:23,654
I have some ideas for how to process that.

672
01:04:24,535 --> 01:04:24,955
Perfect.

673
01:04:34,899 --> 01:04:35,419
Awesome.

674
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,040
I did already have.

675
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:39,140
OK.

676
01:04:45,485 --> 01:04:48,477
Is there anything else that you all want to chat about?

677
01:04:50,413 --> 01:04:52,134
today, Ethan?

678
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:53,694
I'm sorry.

679
01:04:53,914 --> 01:05:01,017
I just want to go back to a previous part of the discussion when we were talking about the library, the information that they had.

680
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,318
I'm remembering the names.

681
01:05:03,438 --> 01:05:08,420
And Luke, it was probably Vicki that you worked with there who gave you all that information.

682
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,280
But she's gone.

683
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,341
And the person, she retired.

684
01:05:11,381 --> 01:05:15,202
The person who's there now, just for point of information, is Zoe.

685
01:05:16,903 --> 01:05:17,283
Zoe?

686
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:19,784
Zoe, yeah, if you wanted to add that.

687
01:05:24,764 --> 01:05:26,145
She's the reference librarian.

688
01:05:27,485 --> 01:05:28,666
Yeah, Maria, I think you're right.

689
01:05:28,786 --> 01:05:29,626
It's ringing a bell.

690
01:05:30,366 --> 01:05:39,450
I probably got her name written down somewhere because I walked out of there with a bunch of like scanned images of things.

691
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:42,191
Really helpful.

692
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:43,351
She was wonderful.

693
01:05:46,452 --> 01:05:46,672
Cool.

694
01:05:47,753 --> 01:05:48,393
Anything else?

695
01:05:53,475 --> 01:05:54,295
that you all can think of?

696
01:05:55,096 --> 01:06:05,382
Okay, so I need somebody to make a motion to recommend this plan to the larger committee, because that was our job today.

697
01:06:06,703 --> 01:06:08,744
So if somebody might make a motion.

698
01:06:10,024 --> 01:06:11,966
Motion to recommend to the larger committee.

699
01:06:13,426 --> 01:06:16,148
By Nicole, is there a second?

700
01:06:16,548 --> 01:06:16,948
Seconded.

701
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:19,450
Andrea?

702
01:06:22,268 --> 01:06:31,690
Okay, and because we are on Zoom, one of the variables of the open meeting law is that all votes are taken by a roll call.

703
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,370
So, roll call.

704
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:34,850
Maria?

705
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:35,671
Yes.

706
01:06:36,651 --> 01:06:37,151
Nicole?

707
01:06:37,591 --> 01:06:37,831
Yes.

708
01:06:38,751 --> 01:06:39,011
Luke?

709
01:06:39,891 --> 01:06:40,171
Yes.

710
01:06:40,952 --> 01:06:41,412
Marissa?

711
01:06:42,372 --> 01:06:42,612
Yes.

712
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:43,552
Jenny?

713
01:06:43,732 --> 01:06:44,012
Yes.

714
01:06:44,492 --> 01:06:46,893
One, two, three, four, five in the affirmative.

715
01:06:47,493 --> 01:06:48,113
Motion passes.

716
01:06:55,348 --> 01:06:58,789
Okay, and is there a motion to adjourn?

717
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:01,750
Motion to adjourn.

718
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:05,031
Motion to adjourn by Maria and seconded by Nicole.

719
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:07,491
Okay, Maria?

720
01:07:08,872 --> 01:07:09,072
Yes.

721
01:07:10,112 --> 01:07:10,412
Nicole?

722
01:07:11,172 --> 01:07:11,372
Yes.

723
01:07:12,453 --> 01:07:12,673
Luke?

724
01:07:13,273 --> 01:07:13,573
Yes.

725
01:07:14,173 --> 01:07:14,613
Marissa?

726
01:07:15,393 --> 01:07:15,653
Yes.

727
01:07:16,254 --> 01:07:16,554
Jenny?

728
01:07:17,414 --> 01:07:17,654
Yes.

729
01:07:18,774 --> 01:07:20,155
Five in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

730
01:07:20,595 --> 01:07:21,215
The meeting is adjourned.

731
01:07:22,052 --> 01:07:22,293
Thanks.

732
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:23,596
Thank you, everyone.

733
01:07:23,616 --> 01:07:24,478
Thanks, everyone.

734
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:25,039
Thanks, everyone.

735
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:25,961
See you next week.

736
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:27,104
Thanks.

737
01:07:27,184 --> 01:07:27,444
Bye.
