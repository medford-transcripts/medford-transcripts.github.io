    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=65.098">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=68.759">Nicole</a>  Morell? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=70.22">Here.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=70.54">What's</a>  happening to my spreadsheet here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=75.001">It's</a>  a little cranky. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=76.722">Marissa</a>  Desmond? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=78.723">Here.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=79.023">Hi,</a>  Marissa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=81.523">Tom</a>  Dalton?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=83.124">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=84.759">And</a>  Luke Prisner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=86.08">I</a>  don't see Luke on yet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=89.963">He</a>  just emailed looking for the Zoom link, so I think he'll be with us any second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=93.466">I</a>  just shot it over to him.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=95.068">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=95.548">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=97.77">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=98.271">So</a>  our agenda for the evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=102.522">We</a>  have just a handful of things to talk a little bit about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=109.108">Essentially,</a>  all of this information will feed back into a report that I'll give to the school committee on May 20th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=117.414">The</a>  goal for tonight is to hash through these things in sufficient detail that we can then bring them to the school committee so they understand some of the objectives that we're pursuing from a communications and community engagement perspective. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=131.86">As</a>  you know, there were 104 or 105 people who wanted to be on the building committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=138.322">And</a>  they were all very qualified for any number of reasons. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=144.064">And</a>  we can't have a committee of 105 people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=148.885">or</a>  actually 115 by the time it's all said and done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=153.748">I</a>  think people are rightfully excited about the project and they want to know how they can participate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=159.891">I</a>  think that goes not just for the folks that applied for the building committee and were not selected, but also just for the community at large. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=168.135">And</a>  I think if you sort of tune into what you're seeing people ask about, you know, again, we're sort of in this like paperwork phase where we have a lot of like legwork to do before we get to the exciting stuff that is going to answer the questions people really have like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=183.953">Where</a>  will it be? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=184.894">And</a>  what will it look like? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=186.016">And</a>  will Medford High be renovated? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=187.598">Or</a>  will it be new? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=188.579">Or</a>  will it be some sort of thing in the middle? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=191.243">And</a>  how much will it cost? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=194.047">And</a>  when will it be done? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=194.988">So</a>  all of those are like the real exciting questions that I think people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=199.394">want</a>  to get to, but we've got to sort of make our way there over the coming months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=205.68">So</a>  I think just talking a little, talking through some of that I think is important for us tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=211.245">I'm</a>  going to try to take notes and then firm it up for the larger group, but <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=219.613">you</a>  know this is a small group so I want to make sure people just feel like they can participate and we'll just sort of plug away at the agenda one piece at a time and hopefully we will not need two full hours to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=231.299">Does</a>  that sound good? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=232.56">Okay</a>  cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=236.662">So</a>  the first thing I wanted to talk through a little bit was the first draft of the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=241.885">So</a>  Tom is actually going to give us a little bit of an update on that and <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=249.172">just</a>  where we're at and what sort of his vision is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=251.592">Hi</a>  Luke, how are you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=255.153">And</a>  talk a little bit about like where we are in terms of the formation of the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=259.394">So</a>  Tom, I'm gonna turn it over to you to give everyone an update and then I'm assuming this group may have some suggestions or thoughts to help inform that first vision.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=273.996">Great,</a>  thanks Jenny and hi everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=279.45">To</a>  start with just a little bit of background about how we kind of approach the Medford Public Schools website in general, we use a, lets us build out a lot of really nice web pages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=297.621">If</a>  you've been to MPS 02155, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=301.925">You'll</a>  have seen this website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=303.827">It's</a>  been updated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=306.049">Basically,</a>  the school department built a completely new website about two years ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=310.953">So</a>  we have a nice, fresh website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=313.516">We're</a>  going to be building the building project website on the same architecture and actually as part of the same project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=324.344">the</a>  same web platform. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=328.847">Sorry</a>  about my connection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=330.228">I'll</a>  try turning my video off, see if that helps. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=337.648">Okay,</a>  great, great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=338.688">I'll</a>  leave it off then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=340.329">So</a>  we're working with Final Sight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=341.929">The</a>  actual website work gets shared among a few different people, but the two primary actors are me as the communications lead for the district, and our colleague, Lisa Miller. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=355.233">Lisa</a>  Miller is the web design and computer programming teacher on the vocational side at the high school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=361.835">So</a>  she's a full-time teacher, but she also has done a lot of really good work <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=367.517">building</a>  the new website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=369.398">And</a>  frankly, she's kind of the web design, the web architecture expert when putting the two of us side by side. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=377.7">So</a>  I rely on her for a lot of the kind of engineering support on the website, and together we build things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=385.183">So</a>  the reason we don't have a draft of the building committee website ready is just because of her limited time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=393.846">But,</a>  you know, we're hoping to iron that out soon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=396.187">Now,</a>  I will share my screen so that I can point out a couple things on the existing website to let you know what I'm thinking about as we start this process.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=408.095">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=409.616">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=418.742">Are</a>  you able to share, Tom?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=420.905">Yeah,</a>  I should be able to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=422.066">It's</a>  just taking a minute to decide if it's going to let me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=429.851">As</a>  these things tend to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=435.595">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=437.636">Here</a>  we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=441.719">So</a>  is everyone able to see my screen? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=445.642">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=446.752">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=448.233">So</a>  this is the school website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=451.055">We</a>  did secure a domain for the building committee website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=455.638">It's</a>  buildingmhs.org. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=458.9">We</a>  picked up that domain. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=460.842">It's</a>  ours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=461.542">We</a>  own a couple of the adjacent domains, .net, .info, to make it harder for <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=470.348">for</a>  unscrupulous people to make copycats to try to misdirect people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=475.612">So</a>  we do have buildingMHS.org. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=478.274">And</a>  that's what the URL will read when you're on the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=484.399">But</a>  to show you an example of some of the things I'm thinking about, we're going to go to the school committee page, because I think there's some good models for what the initial draft of the website can look like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=496.228">So</a>  the way I see it, there's kind of three big things that we want to accomplish right away with the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=502.275">First</a>  and foremost, given the activity of this committee and the flurry of meetings that we have, I think it's really important to set up a meetings page. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=512.025">I</a>  think it would look a lot like this, where we'd be able to list meeting dates, include links to agendas, Zoom links, any associated documents with the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=523.409">I</a>  think that's really important just from a transparency perspective. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=527.451">And</a>  also to make it easier for members of the committee, because if you are jumping on a meeting, you need the agenda, you need the Zoom link, they can all be kind of in one place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=537.721">So</a>  I think this will be a really important thing to get set up right away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=542.025">And</a>  because we can basically copy the format of the school committee's meetings page, that'll be set up no problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=550.822">We'll</a>  definitely have a news tab pretty quickly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=554.545">You</a>  know, right now our building committee news is still in school committee news. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=559.409">It</a>  might remain there and get duplicated over into building committee news since the building committee is kind of an organ of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=570.258">But</a>  again, this would be a place where any of our news updates could all be kind of found in one place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=576.723">You</a>  know, we did a press release announcing that we had the first meeting <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=580.446">of</a>  the building committee last week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=582.969">So</a>  things like that would have a home there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=587.474">We're</a>  definitely going to need a space for documents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=590.918">There's</a>  a lot of different documents that the building committee is obviously developing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=595.663">As</a>  they're ready, we want to be able to share them with the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=599.387">Again,</a>  in the interest of transparency and also to kind of document the work that we've done so far. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=606.032">That</a>  might look something like one option certainly would be to kind of look like this budget page. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=614.698">This</a>  is something that basically gives us a limited file navigator. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=619.901">So</a>  we could have folders for different categories of documents and then links to the documents pretty readily available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=627.365">So</a>  I think it could look a lot like this page. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=629.206">And</a>  then the final thing we'll need to do, all of you have submitted really nice bios and photos of yourself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=636.15">And</a>  I do think it's valuable and important to list out the membership of the committee <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=642.654">with</a>  those bios and, you know, kind of put a face to the work of this committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=649.078">So</a>  that's the very fast version. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=651.179">And</a>  I can stop sharing, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=656.262">That's</a>  kind of how I'm thinking about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=657.843">You</a>  know, the first things we need to get through are a meeting page, documents page, news page, and a kind of about the committee page that includes the list of the members and their bios.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=672.745">Luke,</a>  did I see that you had a question in the chat?</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=678.968">A</a>  recommendation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=680.128">Sure,</a>  go for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=681.669">I've</a>  seen many of these websites and occasionally when they load. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=688.553">The</a>  browser throws errors, suggesting that they're not secure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=694.061">So</a>  that's not common, but it happens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=697.686">Somerville</a>  is the one example I have on my mind, but I think there's others. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=703.893">Whereas</a>  others, Belmont Stonehams, they load normally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=709.217">They</a>  don't throw any warnings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=712.159">And</a>  so I think there are basic best practices. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=717.022">And</a>  I just wanted to bring them up so that they're not forgotten. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=721.686">We're</a>  still early. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=722.526">We're</a>  setting this thing up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=724.268">And</a>  we just want to have that in mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=726.99">We</a>  don't want to throw errors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=730.933">suggesting</a>  that this website has been compromised in some way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=734.865">We</a>  want people to feel like they're seeing the truth.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=738.73">Yeah,</a>  that's a really good point, Luke. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=740.331">And</a>  certainly the MPS main website uses HTTPS protocols, the secure URL protocols. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=750.717">I</a>  would definitely make sure that building MHS.org is also going to be kind of fully secured and not raise any flags in that regard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=758.482">Because</a>  yeah, I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=760.383">One</a>  of the really important functions is to <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=764.272">not</a>  only to be the official repository of all this information we're gonna get up there, but also to look like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=769.575">I</a>  mean, that matters a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=772.576">Great,</a>  thanks.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=775.247">Oh,</a>  go ahead, Nicole. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=776.348">Thanks,</a>  Jenny. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=777.028">I</a>  guess one thought I had, this looks great, and I think all these tabs make sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=781.912">Just</a>  to Jenny's earlier point, is there thought as like getting a basic FAQ up kind of right away? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=787.415">I</a>  know a lot of the frequently asked questions are already addressed, or at least partially addressed on the MSB website, whether we can pull those in, or just even have, you know, five to 10, like, what is this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=798.063">Like,</a>  why are we meeting? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=799.884">Why</a>  are people meeting? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=800.805">You</a>  know, very kind of basic stuff, since this is a little bit <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=804.593">Not</a>  to say it's an opaque process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=805.977">Everything's</a>  on the website for MSBA, but most people don't know how this works. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=809.809">Understandably</a>  so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=812.153">Yeah,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=813.353">I</a>  think that would make perfect sense to build out in the kind of initial spec. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=817.874">And</a>  like you said, MSBA has so much information already available and our peer districts have already answered a lot of these questions too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=829.216">So</a>  yeah, I'll review some of the FAQs that MSBA has available and maybe that other districts have available, see what we want to pull over.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=836.478">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=838.472">Luke?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=839.253">So</a>  along those lines, I've been thinking about what do you need at the start? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=844.818">You</a>  need an idea of what the community wants to know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=848.762">FAQs</a>  are the responses to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=851.044">But</a>  I thought to myself, what if we conducted a canvassing for some period, two weeks, three weeks? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=858.591">I</a>  mean, we have time, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=860.192">Our</a>  clock just started last week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=861.954">We</a>  just canvas the community and we say we put out a questionnaire, whether it's through a SurveyMonkey thing or through a Google Doc, and we open it up, see what comes in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=872.5">We</a>  may get a lot, we may get a little. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=873.921">If</a>  we get a lot, it's actually pretty easy to process a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=877.243">And</a>  we see kind of what the most common questions are from our community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=881.845">And</a>  then we kind of cross-check that against FAQs from other building websites, from the MSBA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=890.433">And</a>  then that way, we're addressing what our community wants, as well as, you know, maybe some of the process stuff that other websites have already addressed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=902.528">it</a>  would kind of dispel the whole cut and paste feel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=905.731">You</a>  know, if we see the exact same FAQ responses here as we do on the LSBA side, you know, it makes it feel like an empty gesture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=916.7">But</a>  if we, I think if we canvass the community and we ask, I think it will add a lot of, you know, goodwill to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=926.608">And</a>  plus we'll have an understanding of what the community really wants to know.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=933.894">I</a>  love that idea and it actually goes to sort of one of our other agenda items, which is like, what are those community engagement opportunities? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=943.504">So</a>  we can definitely do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=946.227">I</a>  think keeping it simple obviously makes it easier to execute on, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=951.973">based</a>  on what you're saying, Luke, the two things that I captured in terms of like, what we would want to know is like, what questions do you have about this building process? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=965.144">And</a>  what are you looking for in a reimagined Medford High School? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=974.072">Right?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=974.332">I</a>  mean, are there other questions that you think would be important to <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=982.213">pose</a>  to folks?</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=984.375">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=985.275">What</a>  do you want to know about the eligibility process? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=987.797">Because</a>  that's what we're doing right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=989.759">We</a>  have a mission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=991.9">Granted,</a>  we have a strategy that is going to get us to a high school, but we actually have a tactical mission, and that's to complete this year with entry into feasibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1006.881">There</a>  are aspects of the eligibility process that are unique to that process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1013.303">Once</a>  they're completed, you know, move on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1015.184">But</a>  people may want to know about what do we have in front of us this year? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1018.965">What</a>  do we need to do as part of eligibility? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1022.426">So</a>  that I think should be a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1024.247">Like,</a>  what do you want to know about the eligibility process? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1028.148">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1034.202">Jenny,</a>  I'm one of their questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1035.323">I'm</a>  going to actually I just realized I'm not sharing my screen so I'm I'm capturing all this as we talk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1039.569">So</a>  let me share my screen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1045.016">Can</a>  you see my screen? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1047.8">Yes,</a>  OK, perfect Maria.</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1051.491">Yeah,</a>  one thing that I would like to see possibly is a statement about why we're undertaking this project because I've heard some people say the building is only 50 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1062.655">There</a>  are a lot of buildings in Metro, a lot of houses that are only 50 years old too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1067.377">And</a>  I think possibly a statement about what exactly the reason is that we're doing this project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1074.7">What</a>  are the failures of the building, the inadequacies, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1079.182">I</a>  think that might be helpful, and especially in light of our current situation with funding, how we're going to go about this when we're facing all of these other shortfalls.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1090.888">Sure,</a>  that's actually a great point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1094.851">Thomas</a>  and I had talked a little bit about like penning like a welcome on the page to just say like, welcome to this page. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1101.395">This</a>  is what you can find here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1104.397">We're</a>  all really excited about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1105.978">So</a>  I think we could do, we could pull that like why into that landing page so that people can hear some of that as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1115.865">And</a>  I think we'll get a lot of those FAQs in terms of like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1120.543">how</a>  will we pay for this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1121.784">And</a>  I actually think some of those answers are gonna start to like flush out really quickly, you know, in terms of like, how will we pay for the feasibility study? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1131.55">All</a>  those answers are gonna come really fast because we actually have a short window to set aside our feasibility money here in Medford because free cash will be available only until June 30. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1142.396">So</a>  we will need to get that done before June 30. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1145.758">So,</a>  you know, we will have, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1148.749">you</a>  know, if the plan continues to be to use free cash, we will have to get a favorable vote from the council to move that money earmarked into this, into the, oh my God, what's the word I'm looking for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1166.619">Sustainability</a>  fund, oh yeah, it starts with an S, stability fund, thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1173.697">into</a>  the stability fund before June 30 so that it is there and ready to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1179.665">Stabilization.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1180.306">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1182.609">I</a>  think there will be a lot of good questions about that along the way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1188.293">I</a>  do like the idea of asking people what they want to know before we push out just a pile of FAQs, because I think we can anticipate reasonably the questions people have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1200.563">This</a>  committee is 25 people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1201.824">I</a>  think we have a good perspective on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1204.726">But</a>  to the point of community engagement, I think I want to hear from people first before we start telling them what questions we think that they have.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1215.988">Yeah,</a>  and I think that helps just keep the number manageable too, because if you're putting down like 30 FAQs, people just check out and can't find what they want anyways. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1224.851">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1228.332">So</a>  I have three questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1232.053">What</a>  questions do you have about the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1235.855">What</a>  questions do you have about the MSBA eligibility process? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1239.876">And</a>  this is not a full question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1246.212">What</a>  do you want to see in a reimagined MHS? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1255.639">How's</a>  that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1259.781">Do</a>  we want to know, you know, we do a lot of surveying where we're collecting demographic information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1265.806">Luke?</a> </p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1270.177">So</a>  for the last one, I like the spirit of it, but you're just going to get a lot of answers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1276.784">And</a>  for the FAQ, and I think that's a question to ask, but for the FAQ, maybe frame it as, you know, like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1291.858">what</a>  questions would you have about the reimagined high school? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1296.499">Because</a>  we want to produce questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1300.941">Sorry,</a>  I might be hyper-focusing on one.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1303.862">I</a>  think we can probably do both, ask, try to inform the FAQ, and start to get people excited about what might this look like in the end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1315.465">I</a>  was able to take a tour of Arlington High School. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1322.835">They</a>  just had stuff that certainly I didn't have when I went to high school and MHS doesn't have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1330.357">They</a>  had a room, they called it the discourse room and had discourse on the wall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1336.339">It</a>  was like a shared classroom space where multiple classrooms could convene together and do things like have debates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1345.422">It's</a>  set up in a fashion that facilitates that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1350.703">And</a>  of course, the principles like here's the one thing I don't like about this room, but in general, it was like the idea of like collaboration space for classrooms to work together was I was just like, oh, if you asked me what I wanted in a building, I never could have described that because it's beyond. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1368.709">anything</a>  I've seen, and I don't work in schools every single day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1372.232">So</a>  there's stuff like that where I think asking people what they want to see is going to give us some really fascinating ideas because people in Medford have been everywhere and have all kinds of different experiences. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1385.601">And</a>  it might just give us some good food for thought to help us inform the <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1392.023">educational</a>  profile, like ask as well, which I think is pretty exciting.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1396.767">I</a>  think I'm tracking now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1398.849">And</a>  so now I'm starting to imagine the questionnaire as two way communication, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1405.714">So</a>  we're asking you community for questions that you have about all this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1411.499">But</a>  we're also going to ask you a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1414.521">What</a>  do you want to see? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1415.281">And</a>  if you structure it that way and almost break out the third question as a separate thing, here's a question to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1420.824">I</a>  think that could work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1423.865">And</a>  I think people would really enjoy that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1426.346">And</a>  there might be some people that really just want to talk about what they want to see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1430.368">And</a>  they may not even give us any useful questions, whereas you might find these other sort of like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1435.971">I</a>  don't know, more procedural process driven people who have a lot of questions about how are you going to get from point A to point B to C and so on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1444.294">And</a>  so structuring that way as almost two separate sections in a short questionnaire could be really effective in getting like broader engagement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1473.204">That</a>  looks awesome to me, but what are others on the committee think?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1501.445">I</a>  mean, there's one possibility, and not to narrow it right out the gate, but we could do multiple choice, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1511.292">I</a>  mean, we could, you know, pull kind of broadly about what the community priorities are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1517.796">Is</a>  the priority a sustainable net zero emissions building? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1521.759">Is</a>  the priority a building that includes community spaces? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1525.921">Is</a>  the priority <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1530.45">really,</a>  really big vocational spaces that allow us to expand voc programs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1535.593">That</a>  could be one kind of question, but I also see a lot of value in keeping it open-ended, so I'm not married to that, but wanted to raise it as an alternative.</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1548.142">One</a>  thing that I think people may ask right off the bat is what is a comprehensive school? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1556.046">Most</a>  people do not know what that is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1558.047">So</a>  we're calling it this comprehensive high school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1560.908">How</a>  could they even answer the question if they don't know what that is?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1568.811">Yeah,</a>  we can give it a little bit of a preamble. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1592.876">And</a>  we can include a link to the statement of interest as well if somebody really wants to dive in.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1605.653">Yeah,</a>  it's true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1606.093">I</a>  don't think a lot of people know that's available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1608.094">Well,</a>  I mean, some do, but I don't know if there's broad awareness that the SOI is now posted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1613.916">And</a>  it's not just the SOI. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1615.297">There's</a>  the results of the environmental building conditions survey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1619.218">There</a>  were two separate studies done there, which was actually really important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1622.899">That</a>  helped the SOI tremendously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1624.94">Yeah,</a>  and all of that is available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1628.303">And</a>  I think people should know that it's there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1630.685">And</a>  when they see this survey, that might be the first time that they realize, oh, I can go take a look at this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1636.631">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1638.072">Nicole.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1639.413">Yeah,</a>  I think I think this looks good and I think it's just helpful to think of as far as like the whole ecosystem of stuff we're going to do for engagement and asking these questions because it's just like if this is just like our preliminary or 1st pass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1652.951">I</a>  think it's great and we don't it doesn't have to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1655.794">address</a>  every single thought. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1657.736">I</a>  know this was like spurred by the idea of FAQs and then we kind of, it's already evolving, but then just thinking like, are we, you know, how many other surveys or other outreach things are we doing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1667.763">So</a>  just like, we don't have to necessarily have this address every single concern question we have right now, but also understanding how many more or what other ways or what specific topic-based surveys or outreach we'll be putting out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1689.375">Yes,</a>  that's a good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1690.016">Yeah,</a>  those are good questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1690.857">I</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1720.686">Something</a>  like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1721.446">Click</a>  any of these that apply. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1726.569">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1739.216">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1739.816">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1744.983">I</a>  guess the other sort of question sort of to zoom out from like the survey, which I think is a great idea to start to get people familiar with what's happening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1754.005">I</a>  wanted to talk a little bit with this group about other things we should be thinking about doing during this eligibility phase to draw in and keep the community informed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1771.095">I</a>  don't know if anybody has thoughts on like things they've seen other committees do in this phase or ideas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1776.717">Like</a>  I think, you know, the obvious thing is like, I think at some point we should offer some tours of MHS because there's plenty of people who have never been inside MHS. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1788.222">And,</a>  you know, there's plenty of people who have been inside MHS, but it's been, you know, many years or, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1796.955">you</a>  know, or something else entirely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1798.616">So</a>  we may wanna sort of think about some tour dates of Medford High School. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1804.561">And</a>  I don't think that necessarily has to be like in the next like gauntlet of 60 days, because the next 60 days are like very sort of brutal in terms of calendars, but we could even schedule them for the fall and think about, you know, what do we wanna see in those tours? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1822.06">Um,</a>  but that's just like one thought that I had in terms of like obvious engagement things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1826.885">Um,</a>  wasn't sure if anybody had any other thoughts about that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1830.409">And</a>  when you say this phase, this is the phase that goes until January.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1833.353">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1834.053">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1834.434">I,</a>  like I said, my big goal is that we're done long before January, but even if we are like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1840.135">There's</a>  no building before January, so we have time.</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1846.176">Maybe</a>  we could ask some of the Media Tech students to do some video tours that could be attached to the website and show them some of the spaces. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1856.719">Because</a>  a lot of people can't get in there, especially older people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1861.34">That</a>  building isn't handicap friendly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1865.081">So</a>  maybe video tours as well.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1868.262">That's</a>  a great idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1870.693">So</a>  Nicole's got her hand up, but then I want to go afterwards. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1873.096">I</a>  can figure out how to do the hand raise and zoom.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1875.459">It's</a>  in the reactions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1877.702">It's</a>  in the reactions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1878.643">It's</a>  hidden.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1879.744">Nicole?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1880.966">Just</a>  a thought as far as like, I know <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1885.473">online</a>  tends to be, of course, all this stuff is going to exist online, but directing folks there, if there is a thought of like some physical signage, whether it's like stuff that can literally be like at city hall with a QR code or on like, you know, we could even do like, if there's budget for just like some lawn signs that could be on some public spaces with a QR code where people can then find out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1904.088">Cause</a>  if people aren't on Facebook or all the usual channels, we could have all this beautiful information and people, you know, a certain subset of people will still have no clue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1913.916">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1918.016">Okay,</a>  on loop.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1926.148">Maria,</a>  I really like your idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1928.189">Now,</a>  have you ever seen those before and after photo? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1933.791">It's</a>  almost like this like unique little subculture where people sort of try to copy like a picture they took together like 30 years ago, but in the present, you know, so you'll have like a brother and a sister kind of sitting side by side on a swing when they're four, and then they try to recreate that when they're 40, that sort of thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1954.758">So</a>  kind of along those lines, there's actually a video and it's available through the library and it was filmed in 1970. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1965.763">And</a>  it is like a tour through the school and like there's cuts, you know, between one building to one room to the next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1973.887">They</a>  talk about, you know, this great new <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1977.028">like</a>  woodshop area, they talk about the cafeteria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1980.21">Wouldn't</a>  it be cool if there is a media tech team that they try to recreate that and show us what it looks like today? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1989.656">Then</a>  we have the two videos. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=1992.578">In</a>  some cases, it'll be amusing, but in other cases, I bet it'll lead to almost shocking reflections of <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2001.688">I</a>  can't believe it still looks the same way and maybe it doesn't even work anymore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2007.337">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2008.459">The</a>  comparisons could be stark in some cases.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2012.935">Yeah,</a>  I think that sounds amazing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2015.197">Actually,</a>  the thing that comes to mind is the theater. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2018.92">Like,</a>  I imagine when it was built, it was like the bee's knees, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2023.724">Like,</a>  it's like an amazing theater with all this technology. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2028.068">And</a>  now if you talk to the Medford High drama students who just put on a show, they're like, why can you only hear one voice at a time? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2036.815">And</a>  it's because the technology is dated and it's, that's, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2040.858">sort</a>  of all it's capable of, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2043.461">So</a>  I think that could be such a cool, fun, creative project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2048.886">And</a>  we have a media tech group of students who I'm sure could do some pretty amazing things with that concept, especially if there is this video from the 70s. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2061.259">That</a>  could be very cool.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2065.79">Yeah,</a>  I don't know who to send the link to, but I the videos out there and the library has posted it on their website.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2071.992">Do</a>  you have it handy.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2073.393">I</a>  mean, I could post it in the chat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2077.494">Yeah,</a>  just post it in the chat and I will throw it in this document so that we don't lose it on the side and then I'll post it in the chat.</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2085.537">Um,</a>  um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2090.132">I</a>  don't know if this would be useful, but I'm having all of our yearbooks digitized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2098.014">And</a>  while I was going through all of the stuff that I have to get ready for that process, I came across the newspaper, the Mustang newspaper that was dedicated to the fire of the old building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2113.657">And</a>  it has a lot of pictures in there of that older building, including all of the damages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2120.079">And</a>  I don't know if you are thinking about an historical perspective. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2124.28">That</a>  might be interesting to include some of those pictures as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2128.501">But</a>  just wanted to let you know, I have that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2130.502">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2130.562">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2132.522">Actually,</a>  a ton. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2135.855">So</a>  long ago, when I first got really interested and kind of terrified, I went to the library. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2142.798">And</a>  this is like, I think, after I read the first, yeah, there was an SOI before this current one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2150.261">After</a>  I read that one, I thought, oh, you know, I need to get a better idea of kind of, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2156.54">all</a>  the sort of relevant aspects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2159.421">And</a>  so I went to the library and I spent hours in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2162.541">And</a>  it is phenomenal how many press clippings they have and flyers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2168.783">And</a>  you can actually piece together the sequence of meetings, the community-wide decisions, a whole number of things from press articles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2182.066">There</a>  was like a Mercury, Medford Mercury. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2188.229">And</a>  I bet if you went to one of the librarians and asked for the folder that she had, well actually I don't know if you saw it, but they definitely have the material. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2198.337">She</a>  handed me a folder, like she actually had a dedicated thing, because I, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2202.32">I</a>  called her ahead of time and I told her I wanted to research the high school. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2206.261">And</a>  so she put this whole thing together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2208.501">I</a>  wonder if she still has it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2211.682">It</a>  was like the head of the head librarian. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2214.382">This</a>  is back when they were like the library and they had all their materials on Boston Ave. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2220.003">So</a>  I had to go to Boston Ave and but it's it's thick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2224.264">It's</a>  like, you know, six to eight inches thick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2227.704">It's</a>  like this folder opens up and it's just like clipping after clipping after clipping. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2231.185">There's</a>  a lot of material there.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2240.358">Awesome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2245.693">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2246.375">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2246.796">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2248.982">What</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2250.523">The</a>  other sort of related communication piece for the eligibility phase, I thought, was during the application process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2260.512">We</a>  got some notes from some of our various boards and commissions and people who applied who said, I am on this board or commission in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2272.363">And</a>  I think you need to be connected to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2274.424">So</a>  I think the other thing I'm interested in talking about from an engagement perspective is, who are those boards and commissions that we should be thinking about reaching out to? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2284.987">And</a>  do we maybe do some outreach to them to say, here's roughly what the process looks like? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2292.799">tell</a>  us what the you tell us what the right time is to be connected to you or have a conversation with us so we can figure that out because I don't think everybody is going to be interested in all of the phases but you know and there may be some commissions that are not <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2311.635">so</a>  directly connected at all, but there are probably many that are connected and might want to be starting to think about their place in this process as an independent commission from the school building committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2327.464">I</a>  don't know if maybe our short-term approach is just to <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2335.273">survey</a>  them separately with a separate set of questions, or if you all have any other thoughts about how we might engage with our boards and commissions.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2349.071">I</a>  think that makes sense because I think my thought was like doing like a roadshow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2353.012">But</a>  to your point, not everything is going to be relevant to everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2356.733">And</a>  we also don't want to exhaust the resources of the volunteers, but, you know, in a very long process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2364.156">So,</a>  yeah, I think finding out where what are different commissions or maybe dial in or be interested in an update and then using folks to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2372.098">You</a>  know, you have like a decided upon presentation or something and having different representatives be there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2377.284">Hopefully.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2378.365">Hopefully</a>  we could do that in a way where it's not like, always, you know, Jenny Graham going to 16. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2383.911">But</a>  we can have different volunteers from the committee go to different commissions and committees.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2389.297">Yeah,</a>  I mean, we certainly can develop a roadshow presentation that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2393.705">you</a>  know, we can just like sort of pick it up off the shelf and send somebody to the meeting, but they have like that assistive support. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2400.756">So</a>  I think that makes a lot of sense as well.</p>

    <p>[Marissa Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2408.781">The</a>  board that I am on, that's a summer camp board, we had done like a whole master planning exercise and we had created like a roadshow presentation that we put on in a couple of different, like, you know, we announced it in a couple of different places to say like, oh, this one's going to be focused on that, this one's going to be focused on that, and then people either called in or showed up to those specific events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2432.552">presentations,</a>  depending on whether or not they were interested. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2435.394">So</a>  instead of us going out to 16 different locations, is there a way to bring people together, like four or five?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2447.604">So</a>  Marissa, are you thinking like we hold like, you know, a summer meeting or something that invites all of our boards and commissions to come in here like an info presentation to sort of warm?</p>

    <p>[Marissa Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2461.114">Yeah,</a>  I mean, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2462.767">maybe,</a>  or maybe there's like, after the survey, there's a way to kind of bring to cluster them together in a way that it's not 16 different presentations, it's four presentations to like a differing number of people, or a different number of groups.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2479.62">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2493.059">Okay,</a>  so we were thinking about surveying boards and commissions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2497.521">Does</a>  your board or mission have a topical interest? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2508.764">Is</a>  that the right word? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2509.624">A</a>  topical interest in the school building committee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2528.672">Is</a>  that the right, it feels clunky but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2572.018">multiple</a>  choice there just so we don't get a million different answers.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2578.021">Is</a>  it topical or professional? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2581.982">Or</a>  is it public?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2588.963">Do</a>  our boards and commissions have like a scope or like a charter or something?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2597.286">Some</a>  of them are explicitly outlined in the charter and others are ad hoc. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2602.068">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marissa Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2604.409">Is</a>  it maybe just like an overlapping interest?</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2611.232">I'm</a>  sorry, Marissa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2612.033">Can</a>  you repeat that again?</p>

    <p>[Marissa Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2615.614">Is</a>  it maybe, yeah, overlapping interest?</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2621.346">Yeah,</a>  overlapping. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2623.59">I</a>  was thinking aligning interests or alignment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2629.219">Something</a>  along those lines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2630.721">So</a>  I think topical is just like, I heard about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2632.865">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2633.506">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2638.551">I</a>  like overlapping. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2639.952">It's</a>  either overlapping and or aligned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2645.175">I'm</a>  imagining we're going to want to talk to the Bicycle Commission and Walk Medford and the Disability Commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2654.922">There's</a>  lots of them, and they all have different things that they probably want to weigh in on and be part of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2660.825">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2668.285">And</a>  then what is the best way to reach you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2677.896">And</a>  do you have any questions for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2700.486">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2705.789">Other</a>  thoughts on like near-range community engagement? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2711.691">The</a>  other things that I've sort of been thinking about, there are, like I said, was it just last week? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2719.845">There</a>  are some things that are sort of the purview of the school committee to decide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2725.169">So</a>  for example, will we be going after expanded vocational programming? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2734.856">And</a>  if so, which ones? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2736.617">And</a>  that presentation is scheduled to come to the school committee, I believe, on the 20th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2742.737">And</a>  so there's some overlap will certainly want to make sure that school building committee members know that that's happening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2748.74">But</a>  that will inform the chapter 74. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2753.781">document</a>  that we need to fill out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2756.603">Because</a>  if we say, yes, we want to have a new program and it needs to have this kind of capacity, it needs to go on our chapter 74 form in order to be part of the process at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2766.05">So</a>  there's some, I think, some things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2770.373">And</a>  Curtis Tufts, the co-location of Curtis Tufts, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2775.957">where</a>  we have some subcommittee meetings scheduled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2777.739">And</a>  I think the other big topic where that might happen is when we talk about all of our early childhood programming and any sort of changes there, which I think the administration is still sort of working through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2792.652">But</a>  there are some things like that as well that like the way to sort of know what's going on is, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2801.34">maybe</a>  not just like just tuning into the school building committee but also there's some like topical things that are going to happen outside of that so i'm just wondering if um thomas maybe we need to think about framing some sort of like periodic update about those kinds of things into the superintendent's weekly memo so that if there is something like that where it's like sort of crossover related that we can describe it</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2830.433">Yeah,</a>  I think that makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2832.215">I</a>  mean, the nice thing about the superintendent's weekly memo is that it hits every family in the district. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2839.424">So</a>  it covers our school community really well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2844.409">It</a>  does not necessarily get to the wider community.</p>

    <p>[Marissa Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2847.173">Yeah,</a>  so I was just about to say that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2850.034">My</a>  children aren't old enough to be in school yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2852.855">And</a>  so we do not get that information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2855.636">But</a>  I obviously have two young children, and this is important to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2859.978">And</a>  a lot of the families that have asked me about this so far do not have kids that are old enough to be in school yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2867.981">So</a>  getting the information out, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2871.363">Yeah,</a>  we need to be creative about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2875.243">about</a>  how to kind of collect that audience with time.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2881.009">Do</a>  we create a separate mail list, Tom, for people who are specifically interested in the process?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2892.013">Yeah,</a>  one of the pieces of functionality that our website has is that you can sign up for automatic updates when a news post is added. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2900.656">And</a>  so we could have that set up for just the building committee section too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2905.778">And</a>  that would cover anything that we share in terms of meetings, press releases, updates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2913.3">Likewise,</a>  we do have individuals sometimes sign up for the superintendent's memos and the other district news through that, even if they don't have children in the system yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2926.329">Ultimately,</a>  we'll want a list of some form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2928.651">I</a>  think it's just a question of how we gather it.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2931.253">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2932.334">Marissa,</a>  did you have another question?</p>

    <p>[Marissa Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2935.61">I</a>  did, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2937.01">So</a>  I think the main question, this kind of off of what we were talking about, but the biggest thing that people have been asking me also is what is the timeline? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2945.072">And</a>  like, I know that we don't know the timeline, because, you know, there's all these different things, you know, there's so many, so many factors involved in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2954.174">But</a>  is there a way that we can convey some type of like graphic representation of the timeline, similar to that little diagram that you had pulled out? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2962.776">That's</a>  like, here's where we are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2964.097">And</a>  here's where we go next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2966.397">that</a>  could be, like, circulated through the community so that people have a bit of an understanding about, like, what the steps are and what the overarching, like, you know, this could take six months or this could take a year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2980.124">Like,</a>  I don't know if we want to pin any actual timeline, period of concrete time to it, but is there a way to visually represent this process?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2996.284">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=2998.586">Luke?</a> </p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3002.128">Yeah,</a>  so I just wanted to kind of make the caution, and I agree with a lot of what's been said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3009.614">We,</a>  in this phase of the process, need to be careful about not <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3015.869">sort</a>  of cultivating the perception that we're making any promises for things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3019.811">We</a>  want to listen to everybody, but we're really, really early on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3023.754">And</a>  there might be some things that we can't do or some things that are just, we don't want to give anybody the wrong idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3034.381">We</a>  want to listen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3035.722">We</a>  want to collect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3038.424">And</a>  so I think in eligibility, that's important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3044.574">To</a>  Marissa's point about how long it takes, no one's got a crystal ball, can't predict how much or how long this particular project is going to last and like our performance through the gates, but we certainly have a trove of evidence from other schools that have <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3064.556">conducted</a>  this process, and it's measurable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3067.399">It</a>  takes a little bit of effort, and I've actually done some of it on my own. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3071.903">It's</a>  just like a press releases. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3074.025">Everybody</a>  announces when they're accepted, everyone announces when they move to the next phase, and then it's just simple math, and if you do it across enough communities, you can sort of get a rough picture of how fast you can go through it if it's a pitch-perfect game, and how long it could potentially go if there's <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3090.941">deep-rooted</a>  acrimony because there's examples of both. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3098.028">I</a>  don't know necessarily if we want to have that kind of data science results posted on our website, but it's certainly something that almost anybody could do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3111.44">But</a>  I just <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3114.755">But</a>  it gets to sort of the making promises. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3118.036">Because</a>  if you post the graph and the bell curve is like, we should get through this in seven years, then it almost implies that we're promising that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3125.497">And</a>  we just don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3127.377">I</a>  would love to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3129.218">And</a>  that's why I volunteer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3130.918">I</a>  want to help as much as I can so that we get as close to that as possible.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3135.999">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3136.499">I</a>  think we could probably create a pretty simple and not <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3143.522">grainy</a>  graphic, like I just copied and pasted them off of the MSBA website, but they're not even like in the MSBA website in such a way that it really lends to that in a high quality way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3153.872">So</a>  I think we could just create something pretty simple that would show people what the steps are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3161.1">And</a>  we could just be like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3164.846">here's</a>  where we are right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3166.728">We</a>  are here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3168.43">We'll</a>  let you know when we go to the next step and whatever it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3172.874">I</a>  think that would be pretty simple to do without, I think to your point, making promises. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3177.338">I</a>  know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3184.545">Other</a>  thoughts about <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3189.736">community</a>  engagement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3190.977">I</a>  think we have like a really nice list here so far.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3194.319">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think there's the option of attending community events or just I'm thinking like the farmers market or something doesn't have to obviously be every week, but just let people know this is happening and how they can learn more and get involved.</p>

    <p>[Marissa Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3215.791">Yeah,</a>  if they do that summer concert series as well, there's like the family concert series. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3223.433">That</a>  would be a great place to have a little table.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3225.153">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3231.454">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3231.834">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3233.715">Share</a>  again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3234.535">We</a>  can move on maybe to the next question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3236.715">So</a>  I'm just keeping a list here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3242.396">Can</a>  you see my screen again?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3244.117">Mm-hmm.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3244.897">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3246.357">Um,</a>  and, um, you know, any of the, um, forgetting what the, like, not circle the square, but that's another one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3263.743">Um,</a>  there's another big fest down in the summer in Meffert square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3276.008">that</a>  the chamber puts on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3277.228">I'm</a>  just trying to remember what it is.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3279.749">The</a>  Clippership one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3281.369">I</a>  can't think either.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3281.99">Is</a>  it Clippership Day? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3285.05">Something</a>  like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3286.531">I</a>  know I ended up in the dunk tank one year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3288.231">That's</a>  all I remember. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3289.032">I'll</a>  put Clippership Day, but we can find it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3295.173">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3296.174">I</a>  think that makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3299.694">And</a>  then the last item on our agenda for tonight, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3306.56">just</a>  applaud us in advance for moving. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3310.362">amazingly</a>  fast through this agenda, because I know everyone has places to go and things to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3314.904">So</a>  one of the questions that we'll have to answer in the educational profile is this question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3323.367">So</a>  it says, describe the community outreach that has occurred to this point and any future plans and goals related to engaging the community on the Medford High School project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3331.609">If</a>  considering grade reconfiguration, consolidation of facilities, and or a change to the current teaching methodology, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3339.192">that</a>  we've had in the past. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3339.732">Um.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3339.792">Describe</a>  the outreach and discussions that have occurred to this point in any future plans to engage the community on the proposed changes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3345.614">Additionally</a>  indicate whether the district has determined whether or not override or debt exclusion might be required for full project funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3352.336">So</a>  I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3356.378">If</a>  we get sort of broad agreement on all the things that we described up above. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3361.86">That</a>  is our community <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3370.14">I</a>  don't believe that we are considering grade reconfiguration or massive changes to the teaching methodology, again, with those few exceptions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3381.706">So</a>  in this section, we can point to those community discussions happening at school committee and those approvals here in terms of other touch points of community engagement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3394.392">The</a>  final piece is indicating whether we've determined if we will need an override or a debt exclusion for full project funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3401.994">And</a>  I will check with the mayor, but I believe the answer is yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3407.515">I</a>  don't think this kind of project gets done without that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3411.716">But</a>  I just wanted to put this question out there just to get the juices flowing and have you all think about anything that you want to add. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3417.758">Luke?</a> </p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3423.419">Oh,</a>  you're on mute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3425.253">I</a>  just want to introduce a process check here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3428.115">These</a>  are specific, the grade reconfiguration consolidation facilities changed current methodology.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3437.66">That's</a>  a specific question from the profile, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3440.341">No,</a>  no, there are specific terms that I think probably appear in the SOI. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3444.483">And</a>  so whatever answers we come up with, we should cross-check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3447.385">So</a>  that's the process check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3448.925">We</a>  have to make sure it's consistent.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3453.528">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3478.802">Any</a>  other thoughts? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3494.595">I</a>  also just wanted to make sure that we do have a member of the community on, and I don't want to put you on the spot, but if you wanted to contribute to the conversation, you're very welcome to do so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3505.604">It's</a>  a small group, so we'd love to hear from you as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3514.332">I</a>  think that's probably me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3516.533">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3517.553">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3518.113">I'm</a>  merely here as an observer, so I appreciate you calling it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3521.894">I</a>  just want to respect the committee doing their process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3526.215">I'm</a>  just checking in to see what's happening here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3529.916">So</a>  thank you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3531.757">We're</a>  all excited and anxious and looking forward to the best outcome here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3537.178">So</a>  I will fade to the back again and let you guys carry on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3541.539">But</a>  thank you all for your work in this space.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3544.473">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3544.994">How</a>  old are your littles now?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3546.097">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3547.621">I've</a>  got I've got one little guy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3549.787">He</a>  is in third grade, OK?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3554.148">When</a>  I knocked on your door, he was like, ready for the kindergarten.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3558.072">Yeah,</a>  and Luke was his coach. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3560.193">I</a>  was going to say, it's Logan, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3564.357">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3564.717">Small</a>  world, of course, in Bedford here, but there are many who have a vested interest here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3571.303">I'm</a>  just one who happens to have a couple of minutes tonight to sit in and listen to you guys do your work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3578.409">Thank</a>  you for all you're doing.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3579.47">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3582.397">Marissa,</a>  did you have your hand in the air, or did I hear you come off mute? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3586.46">I</a>  just want to make sure we didn't lose you.</p>

    <p>[Marissa Desmond]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3588.461">Yeah,</a>  I did it by mistake. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3590.562">All</a>  of my kids are running around all over the place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3593.004">It's</a>  a little chaotic in the background. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3594.945">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3599.989">So</a>  let's go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3601.73">I</a>  just want to go back to the top and find out if there's anybody who wants to spearhead any of these. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3608.825">items,</a>  it's okay if that's not immediately obvious. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3611.848">Like,</a>  I think some of the communication stuff Tom can work on on our behalf. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3616.773">But</a>  I didn't know if there was anything else that anybody was like, I definitely want to be involved in that project, or that initiative, because if you do, we want to make sure that you can do that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3634.875">I</a>  mean, I'm happy to be tagged in as a support for anything that's explicitly comms related, since that's my wheelhouse, among other wheelhouses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3644.323">But</a>  that's what I do during the day.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3645.924">Do</a>  you think you could help me with the roadshow presentation? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3650.448">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3654.591">I</a>  am happy to help with graphics and putting slides and presentations together or generating new imagery or anything like that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3669.067">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3680.052">Anything</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3680.913">Is</a>  there somebody who is interested in taking on identifying these events where we might have some tables and some information?</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3695.604">I</a>  could look at that, Jenny. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3697.526">I</a>  could look at that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3698.868">I</a>  was also thinking, and it's pretty specific, about if we're doing polls, we should probably be polling the faculty to get their input and to see what their suggestions are.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3718.602">That's</a>  a great point, especially where we actually know that we can get in touch with all the faculty too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3724.367">That's</a>  a list we already have, which is great.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3729.142">Yeah,</a>  and before this all got started, the principal, Principal Cabral asked me to come and do a presentation in one of her staff meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3739.951">And</a>  it was one of those like choose your own adventure staff meetings where there are like many things going on and people could sort of pick how they wanted to use their time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3747.417">And</a>  now that you're saying that Maria, I remember that somebody was like, are you recording this so that other people who aren't here, was it you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3758.786">And</a>  I think I said something like maybe I should give this a test run before I do a recording. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3763.43">But</a>  to that point, like I may reach out to Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3768.675">Cabral</a>  again and see if she wants to host another one that we might record so that as we head into the summer that the folks who work in the building every single day have some sort of like extra touch point.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3792.69">And</a>  I'll say for myself, I'm willing to devote time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3795.912">I</a>  feel obligated to devote time to helping where I can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3800.214">But</a>  I have three kids on five soccer teams. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3807.257">It's</a>  a real problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3808.698">And</a>  so what I do, it needs to be time flexible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3815.381">I</a>  work on weekends. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3816.542">So</a>  if there's things that can be done, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3822.12">you</a>  know, odd hours, I'm happy to do those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3827.943">I</a>  may not be available to sit at a table or attend a meeting, but certainly, you know, I want to pitch in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3838.249">Folks</a>  identify areas that, you know, involve research or writing something up, like we do on a Saturday, that would be most helpful.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3849.796">How</a>  would you feel about <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3852.13">taking</a>  on the work of collecting these responses and when we get the survey responses back and trying to make some sense of them.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3860.853">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3861.374">I</a>  have some ideas for how to process that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3864.535">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3874.899">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3877.22">I</a>  did already have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3885.485">Is</a>  there anything else that you all want to chat about? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3890.413">today,</a>  Ethan?</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3892.554">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3893.914">I</a>  just want to go back to a previous part of the discussion when we were talking about the library, the information that they had. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3901.597">I'm</a>  remembering the names. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3903.438">And</a>  Luke, it was probably Vicki that you worked with there who gave you all that information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3908.44">But</a>  she's gone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3909.72">And</a>  the person, she retired. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3911.381">The</a>  person who's there now, just for point of information, is Zoe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3916.903">Zoe?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3917.863">Zoe,</a>  yeah, if you wanted to add that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3924.764">She's</a>  the reference librarian.</p>

    <p>[Luke Preisner]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3927.485">Yeah,</a>  Maria, I think you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3928.786">It's</a>  ringing a bell. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3930.366">I</a>  probably got her name written down somewhere because I walked out of there with a bunch of like scanned images of things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3941.61">Really</a>  helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3942.431">She</a>  was wonderful.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3946.452">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3947.753">Anything</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3953.475">that</a>  you all can think of? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3955.096">Okay,</a>  so I need somebody to make a motion to recommend this plan to the larger committee, because that was our job today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3966.703">So</a>  if somebody might make a motion.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3970.024">Motion</a>  to recommend to the larger committee.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3973.426">By</a>  Nicole, is there a second?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3976.548">Seconded.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3978.97">Andrea?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3982.268">Okay,</a>  and because we are on Zoom, one of the variables of the open meeting law is that all votes are taken by a roll call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3991.75">So,</a>  roll call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3994.39">Maria?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3995.371">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3996.651">Nicole?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3997.591">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3998.751">Luke?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=3999.891">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4000.952">Marissa?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4002.372">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4003.212">Jenny?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4003.732">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4004.492">One,</a>  two, three, four, five in the affirmative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4007.493">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4015.348">Okay,</a>  and is there a motion to adjourn?</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4020.909">Motion</a>  to adjourn.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4022.33">Motion</a>  to adjourn by Maria and seconded by Nicole. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4026.811">Okay,</a>  Maria? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4028.872">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4030.112">Nicole?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4031.172">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4032.453">Luke?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4033.273">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4034.173">Marissa?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4035.393">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4036.254">Jenny?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4037.414">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4038.774">Five</a>  in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4040.595">The</a>  meeting is adjourned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4042.052">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4042.834">Thank</a>  you, everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4043.616">Thanks,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4044.498">Thanks,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4045.38">See</a>  you next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4046.442">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-08-24&start=4047.184">Bye.</a> </p>
