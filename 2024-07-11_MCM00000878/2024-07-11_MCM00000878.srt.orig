8
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:58,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so without further ado, I'm going to go ahead and take the roll.

9
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:03,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Jenny Graham here.

10
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:05,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Maria Dorsey?

11
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:05,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

12
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:09,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Nicole Morrell?

13
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Here.

14
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,821
[SPEAKER_09]: What's happening to my spreadsheet here?

15
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:15,942
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little cranky.

16
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:17,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa Desmond?

17
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:19,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Here.

18
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:20,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Marissa.

19
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:22,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom Dalton?

20
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:23,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

21
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:26,060
[SPEAKER_09]: And Luke Prisner.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see Luke on yet.

23
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:33,446
[SPEAKER_02]: He just emailed looking for the Zoom link, so I think he'll be with us any second.

24
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:34,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I just shot it over to him.

25
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:35,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

26
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:35,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,130
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

28
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:39,972
[SPEAKER_09]: So our agenda for the evening.

29
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:45,925
[SPEAKER_09]: We have just a handful of things to talk a little bit about.

30
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:56,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Essentially, all of this information will feed back into a report that I'll give to the school committee on May 20th.

31
00:01:57,414 --> 00:02:10,305
[SPEAKER_09]: The goal for tonight is to hash through these things in sufficient detail that we can then bring them to the school committee so they understand some of the objectives that we're pursuing from a communications and community engagement perspective.

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,082
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, there were 104 or 105 people who wanted to be on the building committee.

33
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:23,223
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were all very qualified for any number of reasons.

34
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:26,604
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can't have a committee of 105 people.

35
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:33,728
[SPEAKER_09]: or actually 115 by the time it's all said and done.

36
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:39,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I think people are rightfully excited about the project and they want to know how they can participate.

37
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:47,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that goes not just for the folks that applied for the building committee and were not selected, but also just for the community at large.

38
00:02:48,135 --> 00:03:03,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if you sort of tune into what you're seeing people ask about, you know, again, we're sort of in this like paperwork phase where we have a lot of like legwork to do before we get to the exciting stuff that is going to answer the questions people really have like.

39
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:04,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Where will it be?

40
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:05,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And what will it look like?

41
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And will Medford High be renovated?

42
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:08,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Or will it be new?

43
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:11,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Or will it be some sort of thing in the middle?

44
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:13,967
[SPEAKER_09]: And how much will it cost?

45
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:14,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And when will it be done?

46
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,792
[SPEAKER_09]: So all of those are like the real exciting questions that I think people.

47
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:25,620
[SPEAKER_09]: want to get to, but we've got to sort of make our way there over the coming months.

48
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,205
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think just talking a little, talking through some of that I think is important for us tonight.

49
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:37,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to try to take notes and then firm it up for the larger group, but

50
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:51,279
[SPEAKER_09]: you know this is a small group so I want to make sure people just feel like they can participate and we'll just sort of plug away at the agenda one piece at a time and hopefully we will not need two full hours to do it.

51
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that sound good?

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay cool.

53
00:03:56,662 --> 00:04:01,784
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first thing I wanted to talk through a little bit was the first draft of the website.

54
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:05,746
[SPEAKER_09]: So Tom is actually going to give us a little bit of an update on that and

55
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:11,552
[SPEAKER_09]: just where we're at and what sort of his vision is.

56
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:12,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi Luke, how are you?

57
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:19,354
[SPEAKER_09]: And talk a little bit about like where we are in terms of the formation of the website.

58
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:31,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So Tom, I'm gonna turn it over to you to give everyone an update and then I'm assuming this group may have some suggestions or thoughts to help inform that first vision.

59
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:36,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thanks Jenny and hi everyone.

60
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:57,440
[SPEAKER_02]: To start with just a little bit of background about how we kind of approach the Medford Public Schools website in general, we use a, lets us build out a lot of really nice web pages.

61
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:58,721
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been to MPS 02155,

62
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,226
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have seen this website.

63
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:05,168
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been updated.

64
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:09,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the school department built a completely new website about two years ago.

65
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:12,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a nice, fresh website.

66
00:05:13,516 --> 00:05:22,764
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be building the building project website on the same architecture and actually as part of the same project.

67
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:28,647
[SPEAKER_02]: the same web platform.

68
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about my connection.

69
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:32,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try turning my video off, see if that helps.

70
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:38,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great, great.

71
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:39,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave it off then.

72
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:41,309
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working with Final Sight.

73
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:55,073
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual website work gets shared among a few different people, but the two primary actors are me as the communications lead for the district, and our colleague, Lisa Miller.

74
00:05:55,233 --> 00:06:01,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Lisa Miller is the web design and computer programming teacher on the vocational side at the high school.

75
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:06,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's a full-time teacher, but she also has done a lot of really good work

76
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:08,717
[SPEAKER_02]: building the new website.

77
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:17,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, she's kind of the web design, the web architecture expert when putting the two of us side by side.

78
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:25,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So I rely on her for a lot of the kind of engineering support on the website, and together we build things.

79
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:32,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason we don't have a draft of the building committee website ready is just because of her limited time.

80
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:36,147
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we're hoping to iron that out soon.

81
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:48,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I will share my screen so that I can point out a couple things on the existing website to let you know what I'm thinking about as we start this process.

82
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:49,576
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be great.

83
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:49,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

84
00:06:58,742 --> 00:06:59,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you able to share, Tom?

85
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:02,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I should be able to.

86
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:08,270
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just taking a minute to decide if it's going to let me.

87
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:11,012
[SPEAKER_02]: As these things tend to go.

88
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:15,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

89
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:18,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

90
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:23,260
[SPEAKER_02]: So is everyone able to see my screen?

91
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:25,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

92
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:26,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

93
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,655
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the school website.

94
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:35,578
[SPEAKER_02]: We did secure a domain for the building committee website.

95
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:37,679
[SPEAKER_02]: It's buildingmhs.org.

96
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,642
[SPEAKER_02]: We picked up that domain.

97
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:41,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ours.

98
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:49,027
[SPEAKER_02]: We own a couple of the adjacent domains, .net, .info, to make it harder for

99
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:54,511
[SPEAKER_02]: for unscrupulous people to make copycats to try to misdirect people.

100
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:57,594
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have buildingMHS.org.

101
00:07:58,274 --> 00:08:04,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the URL will read when you're on the website.

102
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:15,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But to show you an example of some of the things I'm thinking about, we're going to go to the school committee page, because I think there's some good models for what the initial draft of the website can look like.

103
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:21,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way I see it, there's kind of three big things that we want to accomplish right away with the website.

104
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:30,904
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, given the activity of this committee and the flurry of meetings that we have, I think it's really important to set up a meetings page.

105
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:42,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would look a lot like this, where we'd be able to list meeting dates, include links to agendas, Zoom links, any associated documents with the meeting.

106
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really important just from a transparency perspective.

107
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:57,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And also to make it easier for members of the committee, because if you are jumping on a meeting, you need the agenda, you need the Zoom link, they can all be kind of in one place.

108
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:01,845
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this will be a really important thing to get set up right away.

109
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:08,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we can basically copy the format of the school committee's meetings page, that'll be set up no problem.

110
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:13,604
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll definitely have a news tab pretty quickly.

111
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:18,829
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, right now our building committee news is still in school committee news.

112
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:29,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It might remain there and get duplicated over into building committee news since the building committee is kind of an organ of the Medford School Committee.

113
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:36,683
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, this would be a place where any of our news updates could all be kind of found in one place.

114
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,886
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we did a press release announcing that we had the first meeting

115
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,948
[SPEAKER_02]: of the building committee last week.

116
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:45,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like that would have a home there.

117
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:50,057
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely going to need a space for documents.

118
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:54,642
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different documents that the building committee is obviously developing.

119
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:58,286
[SPEAKER_02]: As they're ready, we want to be able to share them with the public.

120
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:04,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, in the interest of transparency and also to kind of document the work that we've done so far.

121
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:13,397
[SPEAKER_02]: That might look something like one option certainly would be to kind of look like this budget page.

122
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:19,821
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that basically gives us a limited file navigator.

123
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:27,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could have folders for different categories of documents and then links to the documents pretty readily available.

124
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it could look a lot like this page.

125
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:35,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the final thing we'll need to do, all of you have submitted really nice bios and photos of yourself.

126
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:41,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think it's valuable and important to list out the membership of the committee

127
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:47,997
[SPEAKER_02]: with those bios and, you know, kind of put a face to the work of this committee.

128
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,159
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the very fast version.

129
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:53,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can stop sharing, I think.

130
00:10:56,262 --> 00:10:57,803
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of how I'm thinking about it.

131
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:10,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the first things we need to get through are a meeting page, documents page, news page, and a kind of about the committee page that includes the list of the members and their bios.

132
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:15,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Luke, did I see that you had a question in the chat?

133
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:20,108
[SPEAKER_00]: A recommendation.

134
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:21,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, go for it.

135
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:26,671
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen many of these websites and occasionally when they load.

136
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:33,159
[SPEAKER_00]: The browser throws errors, suggesting that they're not secure.

137
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,626
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not common, but it happens.

138
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:43,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Somerville is the one example I have on my mind, but I think there's others.

139
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:49,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas others, Belmont Stonehams, they load normally.

140
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:50,678
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't throw any warnings.

141
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,682
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there are basic best practices.

142
00:11:57,022 --> 00:12:00,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to bring them up so that they're not forgotten.

143
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:02,466
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still early.

144
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:03,487
[SPEAKER_00]: We're setting this thing up.

145
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,409
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just want to have that in mind.

146
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,651
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to throw errors.

147
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:14,484
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that this website has been compromised in some way.

148
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,831
[SPEAKER_00]: We want people to feel like they're seeing the truth.

149
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really good point, Luke.

150
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:29,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly the MPS main website uses HTTPS protocols, the secure URL protocols.

151
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:38,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely make sure that building MHS.org is also going to be kind of fully secured and not raise any flags in that regard.

152
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:40,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Because yeah, I agree.

153
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:42,204
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the really important functions is to

154
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:49,294
[SPEAKER_02]: not only to be the official repository of all this information we're gonna get up there, but also to look like.

155
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:50,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that matters a lot.

156
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:52,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thanks.

157
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:55,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, go ahead, Nicole.

158
00:12:56,348 --> 00:12:56,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Jenny.

159
00:12:57,028 --> 00:13:01,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess one thought I had, this looks great, and I think all these tabs make sense.

160
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:07,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to Jenny's earlier point, is there thought as like getting a basic FAQ up kind of right away?

161
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:17,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a lot of the frequently asked questions are already addressed, or at least partially addressed on the MSB website, whether we can pull those in, or just even have, you know, five to 10, like, what is this?

162
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, why are we meeting?

163
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:20,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are people meeting?

164
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:23,707
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, very kind of basic stuff, since this is a little bit

165
00:13:24,593 --> 00:13:25,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to say it's an opaque process.

166
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:29,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything's on the website for MSBA, but most people don't know how this works.

167
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Understandably so.

168
00:13:32,153 --> 00:13:33,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

169
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:37,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would make perfect sense to build out in the kind of initial spec.

170
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:48,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, MSBA has so much information already available and our peer districts have already answered a lot of these questions too.

171
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:56,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'll review some of the FAQs that MSBA has available and maybe that other districts have available, see what we want to pull over.

172
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:57,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

173
00:13:58,472 --> 00:13:59,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke?

174
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:04,438
[SPEAKER_00]: So along those lines, I've been thinking about what do you need at the start?

175
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:07,581
[SPEAKER_00]: You need an idea of what the community wants to know.

176
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:10,483
[SPEAKER_00]: FAQs are the responses to that.

177
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:18,571
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought to myself, what if we conducted a canvassing for some period, two weeks, three weeks?

178
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,772
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have time, right?

179
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Our clock just started last week.

180
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:31,660
[SPEAKER_00]: We just canvas the community and we say we put out a questionnaire, whether it's through a SurveyMonkey thing or through a Google Doc, and we open it up, see what comes in.

181
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,881
[SPEAKER_00]: We may get a lot, we may get a little.

182
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,462
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get a lot, it's actually pretty easy to process a lot.

183
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:41,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see kind of what the most common questions are from our community.

184
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:48,772
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we kind of cross-check that against FAQs from other building websites, from the MSBA.

185
00:14:50,433 --> 00:15:01,343
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that way, we're addressing what our community wants, as well as, you know, maybe some of the process stuff that other websites have already addressed.

186
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:05,711
[SPEAKER_00]: it would kind of dispel the whole cut and paste feel.

187
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:16,680
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we see the exact same FAQ responses here as we do on the LSBA side, you know, it makes it feel like an empty gesture.

188
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:26,328
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we, I think if we canvass the community and we ask, I think it will add a lot of, you know, goodwill to it.

189
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:30,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus we'll have an understanding of what the community really wants to know.

190
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:42,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that idea and it actually goes to sort of one of our other agenda items, which is like, what are those community engagement opportunities?

191
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:46,207
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can definitely do that.

192
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:50,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I think keeping it simple obviously makes it easier to execute on, but.

193
00:15:51,973 --> 00:16:04,183
[SPEAKER_09]: based on what you're saying, Luke, the two things that I captured in terms of like, what we would want to know is like, what questions do you have about this building process?

194
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:13,611
[SPEAKER_09]: And what are you looking for in a reimagined Medford High School?

195
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:14,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

196
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:19,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, are there other questions that you think would be important to

197
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:23,274
[SPEAKER_09]: pose to folks?

198
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

199
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,297
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to know about the eligibility process?

200
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what we're doing right now.

201
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,060
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a mission.

202
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:41,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, we have a strategy that is going to get us to a high school, but we actually have a tactical mission, and that's to complete this year with entry into feasibility.

203
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:53,223
[SPEAKER_00]: There are aspects of the eligibility process that are unique to that process.

204
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're completed, you know, move on.

205
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:58,945
[SPEAKER_00]: But people may want to know about what do we have in front of us this year?

206
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:01,666
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we need to do as part of eligibility?

207
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:04,227
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I think should be a question.

208
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:07,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you want to know about the eligibility process?

209
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:08,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

210
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:15,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Jenny, I'm one of their questions.

211
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:19,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to actually I just realized I'm not sharing my screen so I'm I'm capturing all this as we talk.

212
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,291
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me share my screen.

213
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:25,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you see my screen?

214
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, OK, perfect Maria.

215
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:42,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one thing that I would like to see possibly is a statement about why we're undertaking this project because I've heard some people say the building is only 50 years old.

216
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,917
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of buildings in Metro, a lot of houses that are only 50 years old too.

217
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:54,239
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think possibly a statement about what exactly the reason is that we're doing this project.

218
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,001
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the failures of the building, the inadequacies,

219
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:10,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that might be helpful, and especially in light of our current situation with funding, how we're going to go about this when we're facing all of these other shortfalls.

220
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:14,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, that's actually a great point.

221
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:21,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Thomas and I had talked a little bit about like penning like a welcome on the page to just say like, welcome to this page.

222
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:22,796
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what you can find here.

223
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:25,918
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all really excited about this.

224
00:18:25,978 --> 00:18:35,805
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we could do, we could pull that like why into that landing page so that people can hear some of that as well.

225
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,448
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we'll get a lot of those FAQs in terms of like,

226
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:41,704
[SPEAKER_09]: how will we pay for this?

227
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:51,049
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually think some of those answers are gonna start to like flush out really quickly, you know, in terms of like, how will we pay for the feasibility study?

228
00:18:51,550 --> 00:19:01,976
[SPEAKER_09]: All those answers are gonna come really fast because we actually have a short window to set aside our feasibility money here in Medford because free cash will be available only until June 30.

229
00:19:02,396 --> 00:19:05,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will need to get that done before June 30.

230
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,279
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we will have,

231
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:23,618
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, if the plan continues to be to use free cash, we will have to get a favorable vote from the council to move that money earmarked into this, into the, oh my God, what's the word I'm looking for?

232
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:30,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Sustainability fund, oh yeah, it starts with an S, stability fund, thank you.

233
00:19:33,697 --> 00:19:37,562
[SPEAKER_09]: into the stability fund before June 30 so that it is there and ready to go.

234
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:40,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Stabilization.

235
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:40,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

236
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:45,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there will be a lot of good questions about that along the way.

237
00:19:48,293 --> 00:20:00,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I do like the idea of asking people what they want to know before we push out just a pile of FAQs, because I think we can anticipate reasonably the questions people have.

238
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:01,744
[SPEAKER_09]: This committee is 25 people.

239
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:04,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have a good perspective on that.

240
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:14,294
[SPEAKER_09]: But to the point of community engagement, I think I want to hear from people first before we start telling them what questions we think that they have.

241
00:20:15,988 --> 00:20:24,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I think that helps just keep the number manageable too, because if you're putting down like 30 FAQs, people just check out and can't find what they want anyways.

242
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:25,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

243
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:31,033
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have three questions.

244
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:35,374
[SPEAKER_09]: What questions do you have about the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee?

245
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:38,876
[SPEAKER_09]: What questions do you have about the MSBA eligibility process?

246
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:42,237
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is not a full question.

247
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:53,757
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you want to see in a reimagined MHS?

248
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:56,059
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that?

249
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:05,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we want to know, you know, we do a lot of surveying where we're collecting demographic information.

250
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:05,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Luke?

251
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:14,261
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the last one, I like the spirit of it, but you're just going to get a lot of answers.

252
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:29,476
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the FAQ, and I think that's a question to ask, but for the FAQ, maybe frame it as, you know, like,

253
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:35,739
[SPEAKER_00]: what questions would you have about the reimagined high school?

254
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:38,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we want to produce questions.

255
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:42,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I might be hyper-focusing on one.

256
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:55,285
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we can probably do both, ask, try to inform the FAQ, and start to get people excited about what might this look like in the end.

257
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:59,366
[SPEAKER_09]: I was able to take a tour of Arlington High School.

258
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:09,357
[SPEAKER_09]: They just had stuff that certainly I didn't have when I went to high school and MHS doesn't have.

259
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:16,299
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a room, they called it the discourse room and had discourse on the wall.

260
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:25,182
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like a shared classroom space where multiple classrooms could convene together and do things like have debates.

261
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:29,383
[SPEAKER_09]: It's set up in a fashion that facilitates that.

262
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:47,569
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, the principles like here's the one thing I don't like about this room, but in general, it was like the idea of like collaboration space for classrooms to work together was I was just like, oh, if you asked me what I wanted in a building, I never could have described that because it's beyond.

263
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:52,172
[SPEAKER_09]: anything I've seen, and I don't work in schools every single day.

264
00:22:52,232 --> 00:23:05,441
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's stuff like that where I think asking people what they want to see is going to give us some really fascinating ideas because people in Medford have been everywhere and have all kinds of different experiences.

265
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:09,284
[SPEAKER_09]: And it might just give us some good food for thought to help us inform the

266
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:16,727
[SPEAKER_09]: educational profile, like ask as well, which I think is pretty exciting.

267
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,408
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm tracking now.

268
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:25,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I'm starting to imagine the questionnaire as two way communication, right?

269
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:30,818
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're asking you community for questions that you have about all this.

270
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:34,060
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also going to ask you a question.

271
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:35,261
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to see?

272
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:40,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you structure it that way and almost break out the third question as a separate thing, here's a question to you.

273
00:23:40,824 --> 00:23:43,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that could work.

274
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:45,566
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people would really enjoy that.

275
00:23:46,346 --> 00:23:50,248
[SPEAKER_00]: And there might be some people that really just want to talk about what they want to see.

276
00:23:50,368 --> 00:23:55,191
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may not even give us any useful questions, whereas you might find these other sort of like,

277
00:23:55,971 --> 00:24:03,654
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, more procedural process driven people who have a lot of questions about how are you going to get from point A to point B to C and so on.

278
00:24:04,294 --> 00:24:16,358
[SPEAKER_00]: And so structuring that way as almost two separate sections in a short questionnaire could be really effective in getting like broader engagement.

279
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:54,209
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks awesome to me, but what are others on the committee think?

280
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:11,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's one possibility, and not to narrow it right out the gate, but we could do multiple choice, right?

281
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:17,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could, you know, pull kind of broadly about what the community priorities are.

282
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:21,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the priority a sustainable net zero emissions building?

283
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the priority a building that includes community spaces?

284
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:26,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the priority

285
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,952
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really big vocational spaces that allow us to expand voc programs.

286
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:44,076
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be one kind of question, but I also see a lot of value in keeping it open-ended, so I'm not married to that, but wanted to raise it as an alternative.

287
00:25:48,142 --> 00:25:55,305
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that I think people may ask right off the bat is what is a comprehensive school?

288
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:57,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people do not know what that is.

289
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:00,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're calling it this comprehensive high school.

290
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:03,809
[SPEAKER_03]: How could they even answer the question if they don't know what that is?

291
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:11,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we can give it a little bit of a preamble.

292
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:39,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can include a link to the statement of interest as well if somebody really wants to dive in.

293
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:46,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's true.

294
00:26:46,093 --> 00:26:47,954
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think a lot of people know that's available.

295
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:53,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, some do, but I don't know if there's broad awareness that the SOI is now posted.

296
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just the SOI.

297
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:59,198
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the results of the environmental building conditions survey.

298
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:02,779
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two separate studies done there, which was actually really important.

299
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:04,400
[SPEAKER_00]: That helped the SOI tremendously.

300
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and all of that is available.

301
00:27:08,303 --> 00:27:10,345
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people should know that it's there.

302
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:15,890
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they see this survey, that might be the first time that they realize, oh, I can go take a look at this.

303
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:16,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

304
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:18,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Nicole.

305
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:32,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think I think this looks good and I think it's just helpful to think of as far as like the whole ecosystem of stuff we're going to do for engagement and asking these questions because it's just like if this is just like our preliminary or 1st pass.

306
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,013
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's great and we don't it doesn't have to.

307
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:37,696
[SPEAKER_08]: address every single thought.

308
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:47,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this was like spurred by the idea of FAQs and then we kind of, it's already evolving, but then just thinking like, are we, you know, how many other surveys or other outreach things are we doing?

309
00:27:47,763 --> 00:28:04,976
[SPEAKER_08]: So just like, we don't have to necessarily have this address every single concern question we have right now, but also understanding how many more or what other ways or what specific topic-based surveys or outreach we'll be putting out there.

310
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:09,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's a good.

311
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:10,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, those are good questions.

312
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:10,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I

313
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:41,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Something like that.

314
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:46,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Click any of these that apply.

315
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:53,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

316
00:28:59,216 --> 00:28:59,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

317
00:28:59,816 --> 00:28:59,856
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

318
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:13,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess the other sort of question sort of to zoom out from like the survey, which I think is a great idea to start to get people familiar with what's happening.

319
00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:29,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to talk a little bit with this group about other things we should be thinking about doing during this eligibility phase to draw in and keep the community informed.

320
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:36,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anybody has thoughts on like things they've seen other committees do in this phase or ideas.

321
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:46,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I think, you know, the obvious thing is like, I think at some point we should offer some tours of MHS because there's plenty of people who have never been inside MHS.

322
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:55,505
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, there's plenty of people who have been inside MHS, but it's been, you know, many years or, you know,

323
00:29:56,955 --> 00:29:58,536
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, or something else entirely.

324
00:29:58,616 --> 00:30:04,521
[SPEAKER_09]: So we may wanna sort of think about some tour dates of Medford High School.

325
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:20,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think that necessarily has to be like in the next like gauntlet of 60 days, because the next 60 days are like very sort of brutal in terms of calendars, but we could even schedule them for the fall and think about, you know, what do we wanna see in those tours?

326
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:26,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but that's just like one thought that I had in terms of like obvious engagement things.

327
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:29,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, wasn't sure if anybody had any other thoughts about that.

328
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:32,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you say this phase, this is the phase that goes until January.

329
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:33,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

330
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:34,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

331
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:39,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I, like I said, my big goal is that we're done long before January, but even if we are like,

332
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:42,876
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no building before January, so we have time.

333
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:56,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could ask some of the Media Tech students to do some video tours that could be attached to the website and show them some of the spaces.

334
00:30:56,719 --> 00:31:00,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of people can't get in there, especially older people.

335
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,581
[SPEAKER_03]: That building isn't handicap friendly.

336
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:07,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe video tours as well.

337
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:09,002
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.

338
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:13,036
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nicole's got her hand up, but then I want to go afterwards.

339
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:15,439
[SPEAKER_00]: I can figure out how to do the hand raise and zoom.

340
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,441
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the reactions.

341
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:18,563
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the reactions.

342
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,564
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hidden.

343
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:20,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Nicole?

344
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a thought as far as like, I know

345
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:44,028
[SPEAKER_08]: online tends to be, of course, all this stuff is going to exist online, but directing folks there, if there is a thought of like some physical signage, whether it's like stuff that can literally be like at city hall with a QR code or on like, you know, we could even do like, if there's budget for just like some lawn signs that could be on some public spaces with a QR code where people can then find out.

346
00:31:44,088 --> 00:31:52,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause if people aren't on Facebook or all the usual channels, we could have all this beautiful information and people, you know, a certain subset of people will still have no clue.

347
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:54,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

348
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on loop.

349
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:07,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Maria, I really like your idea.

350
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:12,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, have you ever seen those before and after photo?

351
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:34,038
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like this like unique little subculture where people sort of try to copy like a picture they took together like 30 years ago, but in the present, you know, so you'll have like a brother and a sister kind of sitting side by side on a swing when they're four, and then they try to recreate that when they're 40, that sort of thing.

352
00:32:34,758 --> 00:32:44,442
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of along those lines, there's actually a video and it's available through the library and it was filmed in 1970.

353
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:53,847
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is like a tour through the school and like there's cuts, you know, between one building to one room to the next.

354
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:55,648
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about, you know, this great new

355
00:32:57,028 --> 00:32:59,690
[SPEAKER_00]: like woodshop area, they talk about the cafeteria.

356
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:08,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it be cool if there is a media tech team that they try to recreate that and show us what it looks like today?

357
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the two videos.

358
00:33:12,578 --> 00:33:20,643
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, it'll be amusing, but in other cases, I bet it'll lead to almost shocking reflections of

359
00:33:21,688 --> 00:33:27,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe it still looks the same way and maybe it doesn't even work anymore.

360
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:28,439
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?

361
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:31,664
[SPEAKER_00]: The comparisons could be stark in some cases.

362
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:35,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that sounds amazing.

363
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:38,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, the thing that comes to mind is the theater.

364
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I imagine when it was built, it was like the bee's knees, right?

365
00:33:43,724 --> 00:33:47,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's like an amazing theater with all this technology.

366
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:56,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And now if you talk to the Medford High drama students who just put on a show, they're like, why can you only hear one voice at a time?

367
00:33:56,815 --> 00:34:00,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's because the technology is dated and it's, that's,

368
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:02,280
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of all it's capable of, right?

369
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:08,045
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that could be such a cool, fun, creative project.

370
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:21,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a media tech group of students who I'm sure could do some pretty amazing things with that concept, especially if there is this video from the 70s.

371
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,140
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be very cool.

372
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:31,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know who to send the link to, but I the videos out there and the library has posted it on their website.

373
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:33,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have it handy.

374
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:37,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could post it in the chat.

375
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:43,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just post it in the chat and I will throw it in this document so that we don't lose it on the side and then I'll post it in the chat.

376
00:34:45,537 --> 00:34:46,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um,

377
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:57,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this would be useful, but I'm having all of our yearbooks digitized.

378
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:13,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And while I was going through all of the stuff that I have to get ready for that process, I came across the newspaper, the Mustang newspaper that was dedicated to the fire of the old building.

379
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:19,039
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has a lot of pictures in there of that older building, including all of the damages.

380
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,940
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if you are thinking about an historical perspective.

381
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,261
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be interesting to include some of those pictures as well.

382
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,482
[SPEAKER_03]: But just wanted to let you know, I have that.

383
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:30,542
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

384
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:32,322
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

385
00:35:32,522 --> 00:35:33,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, a ton.

386
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:42,778
[SPEAKER_00]: So long ago, when I first got really interested and kind of terrified, I went to the library.

387
00:35:42,798 --> 00:35:49,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like, I think, after I read the first, yeah, there was an SOI before this current one.

388
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:54,183
[SPEAKER_00]: After I read that one, I thought, oh, you know, I need to get a better idea of kind of,

389
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,081
[SPEAKER_00]: all the sort of relevant aspects.

390
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:01,781
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went to the library and I spent hours in there.

391
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:07,923
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is phenomenal how many press clippings they have and flyers.

392
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:21,686
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually piece together the sequence of meetings, the community-wide decisions, a whole number of things from press articles.

393
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:24,947
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like a Mercury, Medford Mercury.

394
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:37,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet if you went to one of the librarians and asked for the folder that she had, well actually I don't know if you saw it, but they definitely have the material.

395
00:36:38,337 --> 00:36:41,380
[SPEAKER_00]: She handed me a folder, like she actually had a dedicated thing, because I,

396
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,961
[SPEAKER_00]: I called her ahead of time and I told her I wanted to research the high school.

397
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:48,001
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she put this whole thing together.

398
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:49,661
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if she still has it.

399
00:36:51,682 --> 00:36:54,122
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the head of the head librarian.

400
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:59,983
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back when they were like the library and they had all their materials on Boston Ave.

401
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:03,944
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to go to Boston Ave and but it's it's thick.

402
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,504
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, six to eight inches thick.

403
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:11,165
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this folder opens up and it's just like clipping after clipping after clipping.

404
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:12,165
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of material there.

405
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:20,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

406
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:25,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

407
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:26,776
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

408
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:27,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

409
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:29,442
[SPEAKER_09]: What else?

410
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:40,452
[SPEAKER_09]: The other sort of related communication piece for the eligibility phase, I thought, was during the application process.

411
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:51,722
[SPEAKER_09]: We got some notes from some of our various boards and commissions and people who applied who said, I am on this board or commission in Medford.

412
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:54,304
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think you need to be connected to them.

413
00:37:54,424 --> 00:38:04,667
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the other thing I'm interested in talking about from an engagement perspective is, who are those boards and commissions that we should be thinking about reaching out to?

414
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:11,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And do we maybe do some outreach to them to say, here's roughly what the process looks like?

415
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:30,192
[SPEAKER_09]: tell us what the you tell us what the right time is to be connected to you or have a conversation with us so we can figure that out because I don't think everybody is going to be interested in all of the phases but you know and there may be some commissions that are not

416
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:47,444
[SPEAKER_09]: so directly connected at all, but there are probably many that are connected and might want to be starting to think about their place in this process as an independent commission from the school building committee.

417
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:52,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if maybe our short-term approach is just to

418
00:38:55,273 --> 00:39:06,995
[SPEAKER_09]: survey them separately with a separate set of questions, or if you all have any other thoughts about how we might engage with our boards and commissions.

419
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:12,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that makes sense because I think my thought was like doing like a roadshow.

420
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:16,633
[SPEAKER_08]: But to your point, not everything is going to be relevant to everybody.

421
00:39:16,733 --> 00:39:23,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also don't want to exhaust the resources of the volunteers, but, you know, in a very long process.

422
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:30,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I think finding out where what are different commissions or maybe dial in or be interested in an update and then using folks to.

423
00:39:32,098 --> 00:39:37,124
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you have like a decided upon presentation or something and having different representatives be there.

424
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:37,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully.

425
00:39:38,365 --> 00:39:42,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully we could do that in a way where it's not like, always, you know, Jenny Graham going to 16.

426
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:47,555
[SPEAKER_08]: But we can have different volunteers from the committee go to different commissions and committees.

427
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:52,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, we certainly can develop a roadshow presentation that.

428
00:39:53,705 --> 00:40:00,716
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, we can just like sort of pick it up off the shelf and send somebody to the meeting, but they have like that assistive support.

429
00:40:00,756 --> 00:40:04,061
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that makes a lot of sense as well.

430
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:31,381
[SPEAKER_07]: The board that I am on, that's a summer camp board, we had done like a whole master planning exercise and we had created like a roadshow presentation that we put on in a couple of different, like, you know, we announced it in a couple of different places to say like, oh, this one's going to be focused on that, this one's going to be focused on that, and then people either called in or showed up to those specific events.

431
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:34,954
[SPEAKER_07]: presentations, depending on whether or not they were interested.

432
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:46,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead of us going out to 16 different locations, is there a way to bring people together, like four or five?

433
00:40:47,604 --> 00:41:01,094
[SPEAKER_09]: So Marissa, are you thinking like we hold like, you know, a summer meeting or something that invites all of our boards and commissions to come in here like an info presentation to sort of warm?

434
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:01,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean,

435
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:18,799
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe, or maybe there's like, after the survey, there's a way to kind of bring to cluster them together in a way that it's not 16 different presentations, it's four presentations to like a differing number of people, or a different number of groups.

436
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

437
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:36,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we were thinking about surveying boards and commissions.

438
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:48,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Does your board or mission have a topical interest?

439
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:49,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the right word?

440
00:41:49,624 --> 00:41:54,766
[SPEAKER_09]: A topical interest in the school building committee?

441
00:42:08,672 --> 00:42:10,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the right, it feels clunky but.

442
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:56,100
[SPEAKER_09]: multiple choice there just so we don't get a million different answers.

443
00:42:58,021 --> 00:42:59,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it topical or professional?

444
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:07,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it public?

445
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:16,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Do our boards and commissions have like a scope or like a charter or something?

446
00:43:17,286 --> 00:43:21,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them are explicitly outlined in the charter and others are ad hoc.

447
00:43:22,068 --> 00:43:22,389
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

448
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:28,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it maybe just like an overlapping interest?

449
00:43:31,232 --> 00:43:32,013
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, Marissa.

450
00:43:32,033 --> 00:43:33,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you repeat that again?

451
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it maybe, yeah, overlapping interest?

452
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:43,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, overlapping.

453
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,496
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking aligning interests or alignment.

454
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:50,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Something along those lines.

455
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,845
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think topical is just like, I heard about it.

456
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:53,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

457
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:53,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

458
00:43:58,551 --> 00:43:59,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I like overlapping.

459
00:43:59,952 --> 00:44:04,455
[SPEAKER_09]: It's either overlapping and or aligned.

460
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:13,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm imagining we're going to want to talk to the Bicycle Commission and Walk Medford and the Disability Commission.

461
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:20,805
[SPEAKER_09]: There's lots of them, and they all have different things that they probably want to weigh in on and be part of.

462
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,466
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

463
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:37,876
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what is the best way to reach you?

464
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:45,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you have any questions for?

465
00:45:00,486 --> 00:45:04,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

466
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:10,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Other thoughts on like near-range community engagement?

467
00:45:11,691 --> 00:45:18,174
[SPEAKER_09]: The other things that I've sort of been thinking about, there are, like I said, was it just last week?

468
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:24,969
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some things that are sort of the purview of the school committee to decide.

469
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:34,515
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, will we be going after expanded vocational programming?

470
00:45:34,856 --> 00:45:35,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And if so, which ones?

471
00:45:36,617 --> 00:45:40,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And that presentation is scheduled to come to the school committee, I believe, on the 20th.

472
00:45:42,737 --> 00:45:47,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's some overlap will certainly want to make sure that school building committee members know that that's happening.

473
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,101
[SPEAKER_09]: But that will inform the chapter 74.

474
00:45:53,781 --> 00:45:55,422
[SPEAKER_09]: document that we need to fill out.

475
00:45:56,603 --> 00:46:05,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if we say, yes, we want to have a new program and it needs to have this kind of capacity, it needs to go on our chapter 74 form in order to be part of the process at all.

476
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:08,892
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's some, I think, some things like that.

477
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:14,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And Curtis Tufts, the co-location of Curtis Tufts,

478
00:46:15,957 --> 00:46:17,699
[SPEAKER_09]: where we have some subcommittee meetings scheduled.

479
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:32,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the other big topic where that might happen is when we talk about all of our early childhood programming and any sort of changes there, which I think the administration is still sort of working through.

480
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:39,899
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are some things like that as well that like the way to sort of know what's going on is,

481
00:46:41,340 --> 00:47:08,482
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe not just like just tuning into the school building committee but also there's some like topical things that are going to happen outside of that so i'm just wondering if um thomas maybe we need to think about framing some sort of like periodic update about those kinds of things into the superintendent's weekly memo so that if there is something like that where it's like sort of crossover related that we can describe it

482
00:47:10,433 --> 00:47:11,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.

483
00:47:12,215 --> 00:47:19,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the nice thing about the superintendent's weekly memo is that it hits every family in the district.

484
00:47:19,424 --> 00:47:24,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So it covers our school community really well.

485
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,412
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not necessarily get to the wider community.

486
00:47:27,173 --> 00:47:29,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I was just about to say that.

487
00:47:30,034 --> 00:47:32,215
[SPEAKER_07]: My children aren't old enough to be in school yet.

488
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:35,096
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we do not get that information.

489
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:39,918
[SPEAKER_07]: But I obviously have two young children, and this is important to me.

490
00:47:39,978 --> 00:47:47,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of the families that have asked me about this so far do not have kids that are old enough to be in school yet.

491
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:51,103
[SPEAKER_07]: So getting the information out, yeah.

492
00:47:51,363 --> 00:47:53,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we need to be creative about that.

493
00:47:55,243 --> 00:48:00,308
[SPEAKER_02]: about how to kind of collect that audience with time.

494
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:09,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we create a separate mail list, Tom, for people who are specifically interested in the process?

495
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:19,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one of the pieces of functionality that our website has is that you can sign up for automatic updates when a news post is added.

496
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:24,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we could have that set up for just the building committee section too.

497
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:31,780
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would cover anything that we share in terms of meetings, press releases, updates.

498
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:42,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Likewise, we do have individuals sometimes sign up for the superintendent's memos and the other district news through that, even if they don't have children in the system yet.

499
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:48,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, we'll want a list of some form.

500
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:50,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just a question of how we gather it.

501
00:48:51,253 --> 00:48:51,533
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

502
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:54,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, did you have another question?

503
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, yes.

504
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:05,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the main question, this kind of off of what we were talking about, but the biggest thing that people have been asking me also is what is the timeline?

505
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:13,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, I know that we don't know the timeline, because, you know, there's all these different things, you know, there's so many, so many factors involved in it.

506
00:49:14,174 --> 00:49:22,676
[SPEAKER_07]: But is there a way that we can convey some type of like graphic representation of the timeline, similar to that little diagram that you had pulled out?

507
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:24,057
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like, here's where we are.

508
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:25,217
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's where we go next.

509
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:40,024
[SPEAKER_07]: that could be, like, circulated through the community so that people have a bit of an understanding about, like, what the steps are and what the overarching, like, you know, this could take six months or this could take a year.

510
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:51,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know if we want to pin any actual timeline, period of concrete time to it, but is there a way to visually represent this process?

511
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:56,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

512
00:49:58,586 --> 00:49:58,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke?

513
00:50:02,128 --> 00:50:08,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I just wanted to kind of make the caution, and I agree with a lot of what's been said.

514
00:50:09,614 --> 00:50:13,157
[SPEAKER_00]: We, in this phase of the process, need to be careful about not

515
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:19,371
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of cultivating the perception that we're making any promises for things.

516
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:22,973
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to listen to everybody, but we're really, really early on.

517
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:33,861
[SPEAKER_00]: And there might be some things that we can't do or some things that are just, we don't want to give anybody the wrong idea.

518
00:50:34,381 --> 00:50:35,181
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to listen.

519
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:36,983
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to collect.

520
00:50:38,424 --> 00:50:42,586
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think in eligibility, that's important.

521
00:50:44,574 --> 00:51:03,575
[SPEAKER_00]: To Marissa's point about how long it takes, no one's got a crystal ball, can't predict how much or how long this particular project is going to last and like our performance through the gates, but we certainly have a trove of evidence from other schools that have

522
00:51:04,556 --> 00:51:07,379
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted this process, and it's measurable.

523
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:11,262
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit of effort, and I've actually done some of it on my own.

524
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,304
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a press releases.

525
00:51:14,025 --> 00:51:29,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody announces when they're accepted, everyone announces when they move to the next phase, and then it's just simple math, and if you do it across enough communities, you can sort of get a rough picture of how fast you can go through it if it's a pitch-perfect game, and how long it could potentially go if there's

526
00:51:30,941 --> 00:51:37,787
[SPEAKER_00]: deep-rooted acrimony because there's examples of both.

527
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:51,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know necessarily if we want to have that kind of data science results posted on our website, but it's certainly something that almost anybody could do.

528
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,902
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just

529
00:51:54,755 --> 00:51:58,016
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gets to sort of the making promises.

530
00:51:58,036 --> 00:52:05,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you post the graph and the bell curve is like, we should get through this in seven years, then it almost implies that we're promising that.

531
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,937
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just don't know.

532
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:08,037
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to.

533
00:52:09,218 --> 00:52:10,558
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I volunteer.

534
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:15,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to help as much as I can so that we get as close to that as possible.

535
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

536
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:22,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we could probably create a pretty simple and not

537
00:52:23,522 --> 00:52:33,792
[SPEAKER_09]: grainy graphic, like I just copied and pasted them off of the MSBA website, but they're not even like in the MSBA website in such a way that it really lends to that in a high quality way.

538
00:52:33,872 --> 00:52:39,698
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we could just create something pretty simple that would show people what the steps are.

539
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,982
[SPEAKER_09]: And we could just be like,

540
00:52:44,846 --> 00:52:46,508
[SPEAKER_09]: here's where we are right now.

541
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:47,169
[SPEAKER_09]: We are here.

542
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:52,033
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll let you know when we go to the next step and whatever it is.

543
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:57,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be pretty simple to do without, I think to your point, making promises.

544
00:52:57,338 --> 00:53:02,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

545
00:53:04,545 --> 00:53:08,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Other thoughts about

546
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:10,857
[SPEAKER_09]: community engagement.

547
00:53:10,977 --> 00:53:14,299
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have like a really nice list here so far.

548
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:28,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I think there's the option of attending community events or just I'm thinking like the farmers market or something doesn't have to obviously be every week, but just let people know this is happening and how they can learn more and get involved.

549
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:43,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if they do that summer concert series as well, there's like the family concert series.

550
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:45,133
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be a great place to have a little table.

551
00:53:45,153 --> 00:53:51,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

552
00:53:51,454 --> 00:53:51,494
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

553
00:53:51,834 --> 00:53:52,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

554
00:53:53,715 --> 00:53:54,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Share again.

555
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:56,675
[SPEAKER_09]: We can move on maybe to the next question.

556
00:53:56,715 --> 00:53:58,156
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just keeping a list here.

557
00:54:02,396 --> 00:54:03,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you see my screen again?

558
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:04,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

559
00:54:04,897 --> 00:54:04,977
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

560
00:54:06,357 --> 00:54:23,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, um, you know, any of the, um, forgetting what the, like, not circle the square, but that's another one.

561
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:34,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there's another big fest down in the summer in Meffert square.

562
00:54:36,008 --> 00:54:37,208
[SPEAKER_09]: that the chamber puts on.

563
00:54:37,228 --> 00:54:38,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to remember what it is.

564
00:54:39,749 --> 00:54:41,069
[SPEAKER_08]: The Clippership one?

565
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:41,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't think either.

566
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it Clippership Day?

567
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:45,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Something like that.

568
00:54:46,531 --> 00:54:48,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I ended up in the dunk tank one year.

569
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:49,012
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I remember.

570
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:54,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put Clippership Day, but we can find it.

571
00:54:55,173 --> 00:54:55,273
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

572
00:54:56,174 --> 00:54:56,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that makes sense.

573
00:54:59,694 --> 00:55:03,936
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the last item on our agenda for tonight,

574
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,794
[SPEAKER_09]: just applaud us in advance for moving.

575
00:55:10,362 --> 00:55:14,804
[SPEAKER_09]: amazingly fast through this agenda, because I know everyone has places to go and things to do.

576
00:55:14,904 --> 00:55:23,266
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the questions that we'll have to answer in the educational profile is this question.

577
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:31,029
[SPEAKER_09]: So it says, describe the community outreach that has occurred to this point and any future plans and goals related to engaging the community on the Medford High School project.

578
00:55:31,609 --> 00:55:38,572
[SPEAKER_09]: If considering grade reconfiguration, consolidation of facilities, and or a change to the current teaching methodology,

579
00:55:39,192 --> 00:55:39,712
[SPEAKER_09]: that we've had in the past.

580
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:39,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Um.

581
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:44,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Describe the outreach and discussions that have occurred to this point in any future plans to engage the community on the proposed changes.

582
00:55:45,614 --> 00:55:51,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally indicate whether the district has determined whether or not override or debt exclusion might be required for full project funding.

583
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:54,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think.

584
00:55:56,378 --> 00:56:01,099
[SPEAKER_09]: If we get sort of broad agreement on all the things that we described up above.

585
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,060
[SPEAKER_09]: That is our community

586
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:21,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe that we are considering grade reconfiguration or massive changes to the teaching methodology, again, with those few exceptions.

587
00:56:21,706 --> 00:56:31,911
[SPEAKER_09]: So in this section, we can point to those community discussions happening at school committee and those approvals here in terms of other touch points of community engagement.

588
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:41,954
[SPEAKER_09]: The final piece is indicating whether we've determined if we will need an override or a debt exclusion for full project funding.

589
00:56:41,994 --> 00:56:45,775
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will check with the mayor, but I believe the answer is yes.

590
00:56:47,515 --> 00:56:50,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this kind of project gets done without that.

591
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:57,477
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just wanted to put this question out there just to get the juices flowing and have you all think about anything that you want to add.

592
00:56:57,758 --> 00:56:57,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Luke?

593
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:03,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're on mute.

594
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:08,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to introduce a process check here.

595
00:57:08,115 --> 00:57:17,620
[SPEAKER_00]: These are specific, the grade reconfiguration consolidation facilities changed current methodology.

596
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,301
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a specific question from the profile, yeah.

597
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:24,023
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, there are specific terms that I think probably appear in the SOI.

598
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:27,205
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whatever answers we come up with, we should cross-check.

599
00:57:27,385 --> 00:57:28,585
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the process check.

600
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:30,946
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make sure it's consistent.

601
00:57:33,528 --> 00:57:33,608
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

602
00:57:58,802 --> 00:58:00,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other thoughts?

603
00:58:14,595 --> 00:58:25,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I also just wanted to make sure that we do have a member of the community on, and I don't want to put you on the spot, but if you wanted to contribute to the conversation, you're very welcome to do so.

604
00:58:25,604 --> 00:58:28,366
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a small group, so we'd love to hear from you as well.

605
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:36,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably me.

606
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:36,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

607
00:58:37,553 --> 00:58:37,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

608
00:58:38,113 --> 00:58:41,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm merely here as an observer, so I appreciate you calling it out.

609
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:44,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to respect the committee doing their process.

610
00:58:46,215 --> 00:58:49,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just checking in to see what's happening here.

611
00:58:49,916 --> 00:58:50,837
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you all.

612
00:58:51,757 --> 00:58:57,098
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all excited and anxious and looking forward to the best outcome here.

613
00:58:57,178 --> 00:59:01,519
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will fade to the back again and let you guys carry on.

614
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,300
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you all for your work in this space.

615
00:59:04,473 --> 00:59:04,914
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

616
00:59:04,994 --> 00:59:06,077
[SPEAKER_09]: How old are your littles now?

617
00:59:06,097 --> 00:59:06,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

618
00:59:07,621 --> 00:59:09,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got I've got one little guy.

619
00:59:09,787 --> 00:59:11,571
[SPEAKER_01]: He is in third grade, OK?

620
00:59:14,148 --> 00:59:17,511
[SPEAKER_09]: When I knocked on your door, he was like, ready for the kindergarten.

621
00:59:18,072 --> 00:59:20,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and Luke was his coach.

622
00:59:20,193 --> 00:59:24,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, it's Logan, right?

623
00:59:24,357 --> 00:59:24,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

624
00:59:24,717 --> 00:59:31,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Small world, of course, in Bedford here, but there are many who have a vested interest here.

625
00:59:31,303 --> 00:59:38,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just one who happens to have a couple of minutes tonight to sit in and listen to you guys do your work.

626
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all you're doing.

627
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,732
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

628
00:59:42,397 --> 00:59:46,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, did you have your hand in the air, or did I hear you come off mute?

629
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,381
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure we didn't lose you.

630
00:59:48,461 --> 00:59:50,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I did it by mistake.

631
00:59:50,562 --> 00:59:52,724
[SPEAKER_07]: All of my kids are running around all over the place.

632
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:54,925
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little chaotic in the background.

633
00:59:54,945 --> 00:59:58,488
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

634
00:59:59,989 --> 01:00:01,710
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go.

635
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:07,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to go back to the top and find out if there's anybody who wants to spearhead any of these.

636
01:00:08,825 --> 01:00:11,768
[SPEAKER_09]: items, it's okay if that's not immediately obvious.

637
01:00:11,848 --> 01:00:15,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I think some of the communication stuff Tom can work on on our behalf.

638
01:00:16,773 --> 01:00:32,848
[SPEAKER_09]: But I didn't know if there was anything else that anybody was like, I definitely want to be involved in that project, or that initiative, because if you do, we want to make sure that you can do that.

639
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:44,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm happy to be tagged in as a support for anything that's explicitly comms related, since that's my wheelhouse, among other wheelhouses.

640
01:00:44,323 --> 01:00:45,904
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's what I do during the day.

641
01:00:45,924 --> 01:00:49,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think you could help me with the roadshow presentation?

642
01:00:50,448 --> 01:00:50,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

643
01:00:54,591 --> 01:01:03,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I am happy to help with graphics and putting slides and presentations together or generating new imagery or anything like that.

644
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:09,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

645
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:20,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?

646
01:01:20,913 --> 01:01:31,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there somebody who is interested in taking on identifying these events where we might have some tables and some information?

647
01:01:35,604 --> 01:01:37,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I could look at that, Jenny.

648
01:01:37,526 --> 01:01:38,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I could look at that.

649
01:01:38,868 --> 01:01:51,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I was also thinking, and it's pretty specific, about if we're doing polls, we should probably be polling the faculty to get their input and to see what their suggestions are.

650
01:01:58,602 --> 01:02:04,187
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great point, especially where we actually know that we can get in touch with all the faculty too.

651
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:07,891
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a list we already have, which is great.

652
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:19,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and before this all got started, the principal, Principal Cabral asked me to come and do a presentation in one of her staff meetings.

653
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:27,397
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was one of those like choose your own adventure staff meetings where there are like many things going on and people could sort of pick how they wanted to use their time.

654
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:37,244
[SPEAKER_09]: And now that you're saying that Maria, I remember that somebody was like, are you recording this so that other people who aren't here, was it you?

655
01:02:38,786 --> 01:02:43,330
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I said something like maybe I should give this a test run before I do a recording.

656
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:48,655
[SPEAKER_09]: But to that point, like I may reach out to Ms.

657
01:02:48,675 --> 01:03:03,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Cabral again and see if she wants to host another one that we might record so that as we head into the summer that the folks who work in the building every single day have some sort of like extra touch point.

658
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,892
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say for myself, I'm willing to devote time.

659
01:03:15,912 --> 01:03:19,093
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel obligated to devote time to helping where I can.

660
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:24,316
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have three kids on five soccer teams.

661
01:03:27,257 --> 01:03:28,018
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real problem.

662
01:03:28,698 --> 01:03:35,141
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I do, it needs to be time flexible.

663
01:03:35,381 --> 01:03:36,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I work on weekends.

664
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:39,263
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's things that can be done,

665
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,643
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, odd hours, I'm happy to do those.

666
01:03:47,943 --> 01:03:57,289
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not be available to sit at a table or attend a meeting, but certainly, you know, I want to pitch in.

667
01:03:58,249 --> 01:04:09,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks identify areas that, you know, involve research or writing something up, like we do on a Saturday, that would be most helpful.

668
01:04:09,796 --> 01:04:11,117
[SPEAKER_09]: How would you feel about

669
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:20,313
[SPEAKER_09]: taking on the work of collecting these responses and when we get the survey responses back and trying to make some sense of them.

670
01:04:20,853 --> 01:04:21,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

671
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:23,654
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some ideas for how to process that.

672
01:04:24,535 --> 01:04:24,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

673
01:04:34,899 --> 01:04:35,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

674
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I did already have.

675
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:39,140
OK.

676
01:04:45,485 --> 01:04:48,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything else that you all want to chat about?

677
01:04:50,413 --> 01:04:52,134
[SPEAKER_09]: today, Ethan?

678
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:53,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

679
01:04:53,914 --> 01:05:01,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to go back to a previous part of the discussion when we were talking about the library, the information that they had.

680
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm remembering the names.

681
01:05:03,438 --> 01:05:08,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And Luke, it was probably Vicki that you worked with there who gave you all that information.

682
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,280
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's gone.

683
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,341
[SPEAKER_03]: And the person, she retired.

684
01:05:11,381 --> 01:05:15,202
[SPEAKER_03]: The person who's there now, just for point of information, is Zoe.

685
01:05:16,903 --> 01:05:17,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoe?

686
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:19,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoe, yeah, if you wanted to add that.

687
01:05:24,764 --> 01:05:26,145
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the reference librarian.

688
01:05:27,485 --> 01:05:28,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Maria, I think you're right.

689
01:05:28,786 --> 01:05:29,626
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ringing a bell.

690
01:05:30,366 --> 01:05:39,450
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably got her name written down somewhere because I walked out of there with a bunch of like scanned images of things.

691
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:42,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Really helpful.

692
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:43,351
