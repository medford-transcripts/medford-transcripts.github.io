Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:32,786
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,287
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:44,778
Thanks so much for being here with me today.

10
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:49,100
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,101
Yeah, thanks for having me.

12
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,862
My name is Kat Bacardi.

13
00:00:52,882 --> 00:00:56,523
I'm she, her, and I am from Medford.

14
00:00:56,543 --> 00:01:00,365
I'm a first grade teacher in Arlington and a children's book author.

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,201
Thanks, Kat.

16
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:08,344
We hope to hear a lot more about you and your book and being an author.

17
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:16,969
Before we do that, I'd love for you to answer the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

18
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:22,893
My favorite place to eat is definitely Razzos.

19
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:24,494
Big Razzos fan.

20
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:31,578
My favorite thing to eat there is probably their homemade fusilli.

21
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:32,439
Very good.

22
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,880
And the blackened shrimp with mashed potatoes on the side.

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,681
I've never eaten at Razzle.

24
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:42,082
I've been there for like a christening or whatever, but we mostly drink.

25
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:44,863
Yeah, but it's a nice place.

26
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:45,263
Really good.

27
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:46,983
They have really good pizza, too.

28
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:48,744
Oh, check it out.

29
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,332
Great.

30
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:57,833
Okay, so if you could tell us a little bit about like how you became a children's author sort of like what this means to you and anything you think we want to know.

31
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:02,544
Yeah, so I teach first grade.

32
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:05,605
I've taught in Arlington for about 11 years.

33
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:09,766
And so I'm around children's books all the time.

34
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:19,909
And a few years ago, I just kind of had a thought in my head that I would want to create my own picture book, but I had no idea where to start.

35
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:23,950
So I started doing my research, and then I think it was

36
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:35,217
It was June 2018 that I really started doing my research, and then I wrote my first manuscript for my first book, which is now The Little Ouch.

37
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:39,259
So it really was just like a whole Google game.

38
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:44,843
I had no clue where to start, what a manuscript was, how to submit to publishing companies,

39
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,606
How to get an agent, it was just completely new territory.

40
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:52,269
So I really just researched my way through it.

41
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:56,973
And then a few months later, I submitted my first manuscript.

42
00:02:57,874 --> 00:03:02,238
And I learned very quickly that it was super competitive.

43
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:03,920
I was a little naive going into it.

44
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:13,526
So I was originally submitting to traditional publishing companies, not knowing, again, how difficult it was.

45
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:22,312
So then after a little bit, I learned what a hybrid company is, which is kind of like a mix between traditional publishing and self-publishing.

46
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:26,754
And I ended up landing a contract with Mascot Books.

47
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:29,876
They helped me publish my first book, The Little Ouch.

48
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,779
I think it was two years later, that book came out in 2020.

49
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:39,680
And then two years later, my second book, Twin Time, came out.

50
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,082
And two years later, my third book, Ollie and Stella, came out.

51
00:03:45,302 --> 00:03:47,082
Can you tell us about what each book is about?

52
00:03:47,122 --> 00:03:48,563
So what is The Little Ouch about?

53
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:50,343
Yeah, so I actually have them here.

54
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:51,504
The Little Ouch

55
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:57,479
is about a little girl named Penelope who is afraid to get her flu shot.

56
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,280
So I started writing that one.

57
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:05,282
It's based on me as a kid screaming my head off at Medford Pediatrics.

58
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:14,745
So I wrote that one because I realized how many of my own students also had a fear of going to the doctors and getting shots.

59
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:20,849
Um, we had a flu shot clinic at our school and a lot of the kids really had a tough time with it.

60
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:27,393
So, um, I realized that other kids could benefit from this kind of story and just helping them overcome their fear.

61
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:30,976
So I created Penelope as the main character.

62
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:35,979
And, um, it's, that's, that was a special one for me.

63
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,222
Cause that came out right in the middle of COVID.

64
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:43,825
So it ended up like really being relevant at that time with the vaccine.

65
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:46,204
Yeah, everything coming out.

66
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:48,145
So that was nice.

67
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:53,007
And that's actually in all major Boston hospitals in Boston.

68
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:56,629
So it's available for child life specialists and nurses.

69
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,071
All the pediatric units have it.

70
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:09,957
So that one's nice because every fall, it feels like it's relevant with the flu shot clinic and kids getting sick, like having to frequent the doctor more often.

71
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:18,062
And people share really sweet stories of how it helps their kid or how they read it on the way to their appointment.

72
00:05:18,222 --> 00:05:24,325
Or I have a little girl who always reaches out to me when she has to undergo her chemotherapy sessions.

73
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:25,906
She brings it for every single one.

74
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,348
Sometimes kids read it when they get their ears pierced.

75
00:05:28,388 --> 00:05:29,849
There's like so many sweet stories.

76
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,871
So that was a nice first one.

77
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:36,473
And the second one is about twins.

78
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:44,388
Yeah, the second one is about me and my twin brother and, um, my whole family is in this one, which was really special to make.

79
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:52,297
So it's me and my twin brother, Chris, my older brother, Nick, my older sister, Lauren, and my parents.

80
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:56,342
Um, so when we were little, we were crazy.

81
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:05,910
And it's all, um, it's all about how we used to kind of mess with my older brother and sister, and there's all little true stories kind of woven into it.

82
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:15,258
So it's basically about how, um, the twins learn to use their double brain power for good use instead of goofy tricks, instead of pranks.

83
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:20,682
Um, and again, this was a special one to make, cause I got to kind of reflect on my childhood a little bit.

84
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:24,946
And we have our tree house in here and hillside candy store.

85
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,826
used to be up right in Medford.

86
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:31,067
And that was a spot we would always go to when we were little.

87
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:41,089
So that was cool because I gave my illustrator photos of us from our childhood so she could kind of accurately depict us as the characters.

88
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:45,429
So my parents got a kick out of seeing themselves as characters in that one.

89
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,670
That's awesome.

90
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,610
I also have a twin.

91
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:48,910
Oh, really?

92
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,230
Yeah, we've never written a book about ourselves.

93
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,891
But no, that sounds really fun.

94
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:54,431
Yeah, is it twin boys?

95
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:56,589
Twin sister, yeah.

96
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:57,869
Twin sister, yeah.

97
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,851
Wow, I love that.

98
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:02,633
And then remind me of the third book.

99
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:05,274
The third book is Ollie and Stella.

100
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:07,376
This one just came out in the fall.

101
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:14,280
So this is about my nephew, Oliver, and his puppy, Stella.

102
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:16,441
And they live down in Florida.

103
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:22,285
So it's all about their sweet little friendship and all the adventures they go on down in Fort Lauderdale.

104
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:28,771
So I wrote that for my sister and her and her husband are in it.

105
00:07:29,412 --> 00:07:36,359
And it's funny because now Oliver's at the age, he's almost two, where he's starting to really see himself in the book and realize that the book's about him.

106
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:39,221
So it's really cute in there.

107
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,563
New Baby Sister just arrived three days ago.

108
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:45,285
So that's exciting for them.

109
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:48,987
But this book, I actually went a different route for.

110
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:56,651
So my first two, I published with two publishing companies, Mascot Books and Orange Hat Publishing.

111
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,232
They were both fantastic.

112
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:05,435
And the way that that works is you put up your own investment, but then they assign you your team.

113
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:08,397
So you have your editor, you have your marketing agent,

114
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:17,060
You have your designer, they handle shipping distribution, your ISBN, and they handle getting you on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc.

115
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:26,102
And then you're really in charge of running your own events and reaching out to bookstores and libraries and advertising and everything on that front.

116
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:40,891
But I decided to self-publish Ollie and Stella because just from a royalty standpoint, the cost of paper and printing and everything obviously went up with inflation.

117
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:42,992
So my royalty really went down.

118
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:50,437
And I felt like it was so much work that I poured into these that I just felt like I should be making a little bit more.

119
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:54,179
So I ended up finding my own printer.

120
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,203
out in China and I was very lucky.

121
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:01,987
My illustrator stayed with me and she illustrated all three.

122
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:08,053
And then I found my own editor and designer and I kind of found my own team.

123
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:16,302
So that was really fun to make because it was definitely a learning curve from the first two where I had to really manage everything myself.

124
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:23,759
It sounds like you learned a lot in that process and you're kind of set up to kind of figure it out on your own for the third.

125
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:28,606
Is there any advice you would give to people who maybe are interested in trying to write their own books or kids books?

126
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:37,249
Yeah, so I actually have, I was getting so many questions from people saying like, you know, I've always wanted to write a children's book.

127
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,309
Do you have any advice?

128
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:39,369
Can I have a call with you?

129
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:52,832
So one of my friends and I started, she's also a local author, my friend Lindsay Cadigan, she and I started doing author coaching calls, which I still do kind of on the side a little bit.

130
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:55,833
So the way that works is I,

131
00:09:56,773 --> 00:10:20,019
I present a little slideshow to them and I basically break down the different, there's three paths to publishing, so I teach them about the different paths to publishing, teach them a little bit about manuscript writing and how to submit to those companies, things to keep an eye out for, kind of just like about the logistics and then the process, different resources,

132
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:27,503
And then once I work with a client, I usually write them a plan specific to what they're looking for.

133
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:34,548
So for example, I had someone I was working for last week and she was really needing help with her social media.

134
00:10:34,608 --> 00:10:35,969
She wanted to build her brand.

135
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:50,038
So that was kind of her goal was I was really working with her on how to how to like build up or how to use the Instagram algorithm to kind of work for her and get more followers, get more traction, how to create posts,

136
00:10:50,798 --> 00:11:03,445
Just like little tips and tricks about that and then she also needed help with event planning so how to reach out to bookstores and libraries, and how to create different marketing tools like bookmarks and sell sheets and things like that.

137
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:07,645
So that is one thing I do.

138
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:14,291
And I always point people in the direction of my other little product that I created.

139
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:16,032
And it's being sold on Amazon.

140
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,375
So that's a little journal with guided prompts in it.

141
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:21,958
And it's called The Aspiring Author Planner.

142
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:27,242
And again, I made that because so many people were asking, I don't know how to get started.

143
00:11:27,623 --> 00:11:29,945
So there's some guided questions in there.

144
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,126
It's small.

145
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:32,467
It can fit right in your purse.

146
00:11:33,147 --> 00:12:01,978
and there's some questions in there and um I'm trying to think what else there's there is like a few little graphic organizers guiding questions on how to write like specific details about characters and plot and dedication and just like all the different steps to writing um so yeah that's that's one thing I always kind of encourage people just to check out if they felt like they needed some guidance but I do always tell people

147
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:07,059
The one piece of advice that my publishing company gave me was ignore the naysayers.

148
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:14,242
So that kind of stuck with me because if you tell someone like, oh, I'm writing a children's book, they kind of laugh.

149
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:17,863
Or I guess now it's a little more common, but at the time,

150
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:22,886
there were a lot of people that said there's no need for this story.

151
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:30,331
Like when I wrote The Little Ouch, which ended up being ironic because then the pandemic came out and there was like a huge need for it.

152
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:36,055
So you just have to really stick to your gut and believe in yourself.

153
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:37,996
And it is hard.

154
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:39,157
It's a tricky journey.

155
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:45,141
But ever since COVID, a lot of people have learned to self-publish.

156
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:46,302
So I feel like

157
00:12:46,862 --> 00:13:00,992
everyone was stuck in their house, everyone started writing, and people realized that they didn't necessarily need to go the competitive route and discouraging route of submitting to a traditional publishing company or an agent.

158
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:03,954
They could just learn to self-publish.

159
00:13:04,454 --> 00:13:04,614
So

160
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:13,680
Now there's like a huge influx of writers that are self-publishing their own books for free or just kind of like on their own.

161
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:15,981
So it is definitely easier.

162
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:19,804
It's definitely possible and it's easier than it used to be in the past.

163
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:24,887
What's the like ballpark of the cost to self-publish a book?

164
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:32,470
So it depends, because some people, there are people I know who have self-published a book completely for free.

165
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:38,756
So you can self-publish a book on Amazon KDP for free.

166
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:43,301
So for example, the Aspiring Author Planner I made, I published that for free.

167
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:45,023
I just made it on Canva.

168
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:51,686
followed the editing guidelines, and then I just uploaded it to Amazon KDP.

169
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:54,167
So it's strictly being sold on Amazon.

170
00:13:55,427 --> 00:14:01,670
But then other people will hire an illustrator, and then they hire the editor, and you hire your team.

171
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,291
So it really is such a range.

172
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:07,752
I self-published Ollie and Stella.

173
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,413
So with that one, after I paid my

174
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:14,775
illustrator, my printer, my designer.

175
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:22,279
I think like my whole team really once everyone was paid out, I think that one ended up being about

176
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:26,176
maybe $3,000 to $4,000.

177
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,737
But then the hope is that you make the money back.

178
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:33,398
So after I publish each book, I have a big book launch party.

179
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:37,979
And whenever you sell a book in person, you will make the full.

180
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,760
The hope is that you make the full retail price back.

181
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,261
So these books retail for $18.95.

182
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:50,043
So when I sell them in person, whether it's at a book launch party or if I'm selling them for a school visit,

183
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:56,008
or like a farmer's market or craft fair, whatever it is, I make the full 18.95.

184
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:59,531
So you do make your investment back.

185
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:05,698
And when you sell to bookstores or libraries, you would sell it at a wholesale discount.

186
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:08,281
So the bookstore obviously makes their cut and you make yours.

187
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,232
Wow.

188
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:20,789
So it sounds like, you know, there's the themes vary a little bit in the three books, but is there sort of like a hope that you have for kids that are reading your books or for parents who might be thinking about buying them?

189
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:24,335
Like, is there kind of an impact that you hope to have with these books?

190
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:33,926
Yeah, so I mean one author that I read to my students sometimes is Patricia Polacco, she also writes about her family.

191
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:41,717
Because there's so many children's books out there and they all have different meanings and messages and themes and characters and settings and

192
00:15:42,398 --> 00:16:00,858
um it's really cool to see kind of like what people can put out there these books are obviously based on my family so it's the inspiration really came from like mostly my childhood for the little ouch and ollie and stella and i'm sorry for twin time in the little ouch um ollie and stella

193
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:03,559
came from my nephew and his puppy.

194
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,561
So definitely all family-based.

195
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:10,264
Honestly, one of my favorite takeaways from it is just sharing them with my students.

196
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:16,788
So it's cool for them, any young kids, it's cool for them to see what you can achieve.

197
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:19,390
So my students are in first grade, they're 6 turning 7.

198
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,430
And it is really sweet.

199
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,952
It's really cute hearing their commentary on it.

200
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:28,253
I think it's like the coolest thing that I've written three books.

201
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:32,374
And we have them up on a little display in my classroom that says Dream Big.

202
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:37,436
And they always talk about how I want to write a book or I started writing a book.

203
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:43,058
So I hear from a lot of my older students, my previous students who are now in middle school and high school,

204
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:50,140
And they've reached out to me and said, you know, I started writing or I've been following your journey and it made me want to write a book.

205
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,621
So it's really nice to hear that.

206
00:16:53,441 --> 00:17:01,344
So I do hope that the kids in Medford feel inspired and just know that if they have a dream or a passion, they should totally follow it.

207
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:04,945
Even if they have no idea where to start, they should hold on to it.

208
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:09,976
I think it's also impressive that you're doing this all having a full time job as a teacher.

209
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:12,100
It's a big load.

210
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:13,824
Thank you.

211
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:16,309
It's nice too, because they're both so related.

212
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:27,994
It's kind of funny, like when I wrote the little ouch, I read the manuscript to my students to kind of test the parts that they liked or the parts that they laughed at.

213
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:32,136
And I did the same thing with Twin Time and they loved just being involved.

214
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:41,800
So it was kind of nice to have an audience, like the targeted audience right in front of me where I could read it and then kind of gauge their likes and dislikes.

215
00:17:42,822 --> 00:17:45,126
A captive focus group you have there.

216
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:45,967
Yeah.

217
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:48,471
And so where can we find your books?

218
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:50,614
Or are there any events that you have coming up?

219
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:58,679
Yeah, so the Little Ouch and Twin Time are on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Target.

220
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,960
And they're all in local bookstores.

221
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,101
So Ollie and Stella is being sold online, but just through my website.

222
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:12,262
So really, if you go to my website, it's www.thelittleouch.com.

223
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:17,403
And you click on my bookshop, there's links to purchase all three books.

224
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:21,188
But there is a new bookstore in Medford.

225
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:24,389
They have to give a big shout out to because we're so excited about it.

226
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,750
It's Moon and Back Bookstore.

227
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,991
It's adorable.

228
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:29,331
It's right in West Medford.

229
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,312
She has all three books there too.

230
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:37,274
So I definitely encourage people to go shop local and support that new small business.

231
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:44,978
And I have an event coming up at her bookstore on, I think it's Saturday, April 19th.

232
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:48,880
It's at 2.30 and kids are encouraged to come by.

233
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,101
I usually do a little story time.

234
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:57,224
So that time I'll read Ollie and Stella and kids are invited to bring their favorite stuffy.

235
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:03,687
And I usually give out some coloring pages and stickers and bookmarks and things like that.

236
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,068
So it'll be a fun day.

237
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:06,547
That's cool.

238
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:06,947
Thank you.

239
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,229
Is there anything else that you want us to know about you?

240
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,692
I think that's it.

241
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:14,555
Yeah, but thank you so much for having me.

242
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:25,647
And I do just I do just hope that it's it's something that's inspiring for the kids in Medford and that they know if it's a passion they have, they should they should follow it.

243
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:26,868
So thank you.

244
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:28,170
