Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our castmates.

7
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:32,619
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,101
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:43,952
All right, thanks so much for being with me today.

10
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:48,854
If you don't mind just introducing yourself, your name, pronouns, and who you are.

11
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:59,800
My name is Chris Murphy, he, him, and then I am the president of the Medford Football Association, which is the booster club that supports the Medford High football team.

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,441
All right, thanks, Chris.

13
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:09,024
So I'll ask you the question that I ask everybody on the podcast first, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

14
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:12,698
I'm gonna give you two.

15
00:01:13,059 --> 00:01:16,140
I'm gonna give you like a fast and I'm gonna give you like a sit down.

16
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,343
So fast, I would say Ronnie's.

17
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:22,904
I've been going to Ronnie's since I was nine.

18
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:25,605
I love his pizza.

19
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:28,067
Kids love his pizza.

20
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:32,169
He's never failed me since fifth grade when I started going there.

21
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,210
Sit down.

22
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,733
I'm gonna go Razo's Chicken Pie.

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:40,860
Hmm.

24
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:41,681
Good choices.

25
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:41,881
Yeah.

26
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:43,743
I think, well, I did meet you at Ronnie's.

27
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:45,004
I met you at Ronnie's.

28
00:01:45,244 --> 00:01:46,745
You see each other every Thursday.

29
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:47,366
Yeah.

30
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:49,347
You were going to soccer and I was going to football.

31
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:50,268
Exactly.

32
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:50,768
Yeah.

33
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:53,511
Ronnie's is a very reliable pizza place for sure.

34
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:55,592
Awesome.

35
00:01:55,612 --> 00:02:02,898
So, you know, I think we, we plan to talk today about, um, the football team and the Thanksgiving game.

36
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:09,724
So I was wondering if you could give me a little bit of the history about that and yeah, just give it, tell us a little bit about the game that you all play on Thanksgiving.

37
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:16,011
So we, the Medford-Malden rivalry, this year is gonna be our 137th game.

38
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:20,075
Not the 137th year, 137th game.

39
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:27,901
There have been some, they did skip a year and there were two games played in two years.

40
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:31,684
So the game started in 1889.

41
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:35,687
That was actually the first year Medford High had football.

42
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:39,470
And you know, being so close,

43
00:02:41,142 --> 00:02:48,224
Malden, from what I've read, Malden challenged Medford to a football game on October 25, 1889.

44
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,765
They played that first football game.

45
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:58,707
As is on our trophy, Medford won 34 to nothing.

46
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:02,768
Malden complained

47
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:08,200
and set because Malvin believed that Medford was using kids from Tufts on the team.

48
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:14,203
So they played again on November 30th, which is a Saturday after Thanksgiving.

49
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:20,306
And Medford still won, but we only won four to nothing in that game.

50
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,368
So I don't know if Malvin was right.

51
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:28,831
You know, maybe they just had a bountiful Thanksgiving.

52
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:31,332
So they were, you know, they weren't playing well, but

53
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:39,889
you know, I wasn't there, but, and then back, and then 1890, they didn't play.

54
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:45,254
And then back in 1891, they played another two games, Medford won both games.

55
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:48,256
So we started off good with 4-0.

56
00:03:48,757 --> 00:03:55,202
And then every year since 1891, both teams have played.

57
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:59,426
It became a Thanksgiving rivalry for the first time in 1897.

58
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:08,080
And then in 1899, it became an official Thanksgiving rivalry.

59
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:20,466
So with the exception of a couple of years due to weather, and then due to when we played in Fenway Park, the game has been played on Thanksgiving every year since 1899.

60
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:31,092
And to give people an idea, like 1899, you're talking two centuries ago, you're talking Medford's only been a city for less than 10 years.

61
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:40,158
Medford High School was still just one building on Forest Street and hadn't expanded the way it has.

62
00:04:40,178 --> 00:04:42,199
Yeah.

63
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,801
Where did they play football then, do you know?

64
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:54,388
They played, from what I've been able to catch, it was called the Medford Polo Grounds at Brooks Playstead.

65
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:56,149
So it was Playstead Park.

66
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,612
And then some other stuff I found said there used to be a field

67
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:04,138
on the corner of Salem Street and Otis Street, there was a field.

68
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:19,309
And then if you know where Gillis Park is now on Fulton Street, before 93 was there, that was actually called the Fulton Street Grounds, and then later became Gillis Field.

69
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:29,097
Gillis Field was named after a John Gillis, who was a big Medford baseball and football player, actually played for the Red Sox.

70
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:40,340
So we played at Gillis Field, I think from like the early 19-teens all the way up till the 1960, 61, if I'm not mistaken.

71
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,221
And then we've been at Hormel since 1965.

72
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:51,589
And then they did play the game at Tufts a few times from what else I was able to find.

73
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:58,115
And then Tufts, they did play at Tufts a few times when we had like a really bad weather.

74
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:02,257
Tufts was able to, I guess, get the snow off their field a lot better.

75
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:04,358
So we played that on.

76
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,459
Fenway Park was like just a couple of years ago, right?

77
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,119
Yeah.

78
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:16,384
So in the 135th game every year, Fenway hosts either anywhere from like four to six games every year.

79
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:27,130
A few years ago, we were, you know, offered like a once in a lifetime, I guess you would say, type of deal to

80
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:29,211
play at Fenway.

81
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:32,593
It was and we were the home team.

82
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:36,455
So it's kind of cool that we got to use the Red Sox locker room.

83
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:40,657
We got to dress in there and hang out in there and it was cool.

84
00:06:40,677 --> 00:06:43,199
We did when we did the entrance onto the field.

85
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:51,643
We went through the way the the that the Red Sox go do like do the warm up and

86
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,014
I still have that video on my phone.

87
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:56,056
I haven't deleted that video or moved it over.

88
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:57,858
I keep carrying it on my phone.

89
00:06:57,898 --> 00:06:58,879
It's still kind of cool.

90
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,760
I still watch it from time to time.

91
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:02,882
I'm going through videos to delete.

92
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:03,923
I'm like, eh, OK.

93
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,027
But that was it.

94
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:16,414
It didn't have the outcome we wanted, but the experience was really cool.

95
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:17,675
The only thing I had that was

96
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:23,361
I would say negative about that was it wasn't on Thanksgiving.

97
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:26,603
It's like when the game was over, I'm like, what am I going to do?

98
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:27,763
What am I going to do Thursday?

99
00:07:27,783 --> 00:07:28,504
No, I've been doing this.

100
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:31,606
The same thing for 30 years.

101
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:35,008
It's like now I gotta help.

102
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,510
I guess I guess I gotta go over and help my dad cook or something like that.

103
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,853
So that was my only qualm about the Fenway game, but it was definitely a really

104
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,504
a really cool experience.

105
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,546
And I'm glad the kids got to enjoy it.

106
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:54,991
But yeah, that was just another really cool thing that we were able to add to the history of this game.

107
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:57,833
And so what can we expect this year?

108
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,074
How's the season been going?

109
00:07:59,134 --> 00:07:59,514
What do you think?

110
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,075
Season's been going really well.

111
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:05,759
We're five and four right now.

112
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:12,524
We have our last game before Thanksgiving tonight against Waltham, who actually used to be a team we played

113
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:17,140
Waltham was in the greater Boston league, which is our league for about 20 years.

114
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,181
And then they switched over.

115
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:19,621
I think it's the old colony league.

116
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:32,549
Um, we, we started off a little slow on three and then we went on a nice five game win streak, which was great because we haven't had a five game win streak since 1981.

117
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,693
So, um, it's bad.

118
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,854
You know, we, we, we did get, we have had, uh,

119
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:46,675
You know, we did have a tough several years for decades.

120
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:52,079
But we have an amazing coach now, John Curley.

121
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,381
Those who don't know John, he runs the rink.

122
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:57,643
He's been the coach for the last six years.

123
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:05,749
He's really had brought a great kind of swag about the team now.

124
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:08,491
They're more confident than I've ever seen.

125
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:10,352
They're well prepared.

126
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:15,344
put in that offseason work better than I've seen in a long time.

127
00:09:15,444 --> 00:09:18,566
And it's really paid off with this five game win streak.

128
00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:23,390
You know, we've had more GBL All-Stars this year than we've ever had at seven.

129
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,694
Justin Marino is our quarterback, is the league MVP.

130
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:38,561
He's on pace to get the league's school scoring record, which is only 178 points.

131
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:41,363
He's about 18 points away from the record, which is good.

132
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:48,173
We have some other great seniors who are looking at, you know, who are looking to go play at the next level in college.

133
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:49,954
So it's just been an all-around great year.

134
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:54,296
Did have some other records broken this year.

135
00:09:54,356 --> 00:10:08,521
We broke our single game scoring record by Justin, six in a game, which actually was a record that was set in 1973 at a Thanksgiving Day game by a guy named Mike Colonna.

136
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:10,402
He had five touchdowns and 266 yards.

137
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:21,590
So we broke a nice 51 year record that stood and Justin's grandfather actually played on that gate in that team with he was a captain acting team.

138
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,391
So it was kind of cool that like Justin's grandpa got to text his old teammates.

139
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:40,153
And we also have, you know, something I've always been pretty proud of in my tenure is we had the first female varsity football player a couple years ago, a girl by the name of Tess Morrow.

140
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:45,820
And this year we had our first female score points in a game.

141
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:51,465
Brianna Cerullo, she's got a two point conversion against Chelsea on senior night.

142
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,508
So that was another nice accolade.

143
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:56,730
So it's been a great year.

144
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:05,197
They said start off a little slow, they caught their feeding, but then they've gone, they've just had a nice run and

145
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:12,442
You know, hopefully these last two weeks we can feed off that run and still, and then strong, which is, would be great.

146
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:16,046
Do you have a prediction for how the Thanksgiving game will go?

147
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,928
I think we'll win.

148
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:27,778
Um, I, I don't want to give, I don't like to give the score because I did that once and it wasn't great.

149
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:28,659
So I don't want to jinx it.

150
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:29,860
Um,

151
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:38,737
It's interesting, because to go back to the game a little bit, I wrote actually some things down.

152
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:45,981
So the only time we've ever gone into this game undefeated, both teams, was 1951.

153
00:11:46,161 --> 00:12:00,909
There have been 31 total times during the 136 games our league title was determined by this game, and 18 times the Eastern Massachusetts Championship

154
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,071
has been, was settled on this game.

155
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:17,957
So it's kind of like, when you read like some of like the old box scores and like, I've read like a lot of Globe articles from back in the day to like kind of get ready for this.

156
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:25,400
There are a lot of times like a team will come in like boys to win the league and go undefeated and they'll lose.

157
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:30,503
Like that's a really cool thing about the game is like, it's almost like,

158
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:47,383
your record goes out the window, everything you've done before that goes out the window, and it's kind of like a new season, new, you know, it takes on, there have been times where we have probably, we should have gone in and won this game, and we didn't.

159
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:51,184
And there are times that they've gone in, should have won this game, and they didn't.

160
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,544
So that's the other really cool thing.

161
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:58,425
And, you know, like last year, we started off a little slow, we went into,

162
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:10,615
halftime six and often they came back tied at six or six and then we just went on a tear and I think we forced like five into five turnovers in the second half and end up winning the game 3036 to 12.

163
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:21,602
So it's going the way I have the confidence that they play the way that they've played and continue to do what they're supposed to do that they'll

164
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:23,499
yeah, we'll keep the trophy.

165
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,664
So we haven't we haven't won back to back games in a while.

166
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:45,437
So it'd be good to get that'll be another great thing that we can just add to like, I said, I said to them, it'd be be your goal is to check boxes this year, things we haven't done in five years, 10 years, 15 years.

167
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,279
And they've checked a lot of boxes.

168
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,001
So it'd be nice to, to check a couple more.

169
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:51,982
Hmm.

170
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:53,865
Yeah.

171
00:13:53,885 --> 00:14:06,550
So, um, one thing that I'm always interested in is kind of like how your work with football, you know, it's, you know, it sounds like you played football for Medford high and you're still, you know, now you're president of the booster, still involved with the team.

172
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:15,374
What are you hope like, what, or what do you think you've taken away from playing football and what do you kind of hope that the current players, what do you think, what do you hope to get from there?

173
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:19,696
So I, I grew up in a,

174
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,523
We were, you know, my dad was a union guy, my mom, you know, worked part time.

175
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:31,586
My dad went to Medford High, my uncles.

176
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:39,650
So when I was like, I think I was nine years old, the first time my dad would say, All right, we're gonna go watch Medford Malden.

177
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:42,206
And it was kind of cool.

178
00:14:42,226 --> 00:15:09,966
You know, we would go went to the Irish American on Malden, they had like this dollar breakfast, which I think it's like still like a $2 breakfast, which you still is like you go there and there's still like 1000 people and they're all going to the game and we go we'd have breakfast and then we'd go over to the game and there would just be all these people and yeah, I you know, being a little kid and I see what my son now like, you know, when I when I get older, I want to I want to be the people that are watching.

179
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:16,559
So when I became a freshman, first thing, I'm going off of football.

180
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,841
I played four years, I graduated in 2004.

181
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:29,445
I would say football is, everybody has a job.

182
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:30,865
Everybody has a different job.

183
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,247
When your margin of error is low,

184
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:41,164
you're forced to work together, you can't, one person can't just determine the outcome.

185
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:51,475
Football gets you, and team sports in general, gets you ready for life in ways that you can't teach.

186
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:59,323
I think, and you know, I'm not knocking people that don't play sports, but I think people that play sports definitely have an advantage going

187
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:09,055
into work, like, because, again, you have a job to do, your margin of error is low, you're forced to work as a team.

188
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:19,179
It's got me, and then the relationships you make, like, I've made friends in football that I still have today.

189
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,881
I had guys in my wedding party that I met playing football.

190
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:30,488
If I look at my group chats, like my three big group chats, I guess you'll say two of them involve kids that I played football with.

191
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:51,183
So I think the aspect of learning how to be, you know, how to take criticism, how to work as a team, how to work toward making yourself better are amazing things that I would totally suggest to people.

192
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:53,285
In team sports in general, I think that

193
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:58,381
there are a lot of any type of team sport is going to help you too.

194
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:06,806
I, I, I don't have a kid in the program, which is kind of like, like most of the time, like the booster club president has been a father.

195
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,227
I was helping out.

196
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:11,428
And then it came time.

197
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:18,173
We had a, a big group of parents that were leaving because their kids had already graduated like two, three years ago.

198
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:21,214
And they're like, you know, we stayed on it's time to move on.

199
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:22,115
And then it's like, all right, well,

200
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:27,221
nominations for president and like, we kind of hooked around like everybody's got their hand out.

201
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:30,342
And I'm like, I'll do it for a year or two.

202
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:36,246
Um, there I am 10 years later.

203
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:47,833
Every year my wife is kind of like, but it's, you know what, it gives me a chance to keep busy.

204
00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:52,345
I got my kids involved with it now, like my kids love going to games.

205
00:17:53,426 --> 00:18:00,710
It's funny, like I have a picture of me and my daughter at every Method High opener since she was a month and a half old.

206
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:08,174
So that's like our annual, it's like, the only tough thing is she's like, well, you helped me in the first ones, you have to help me now.

207
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:09,855
And I'm like, seven and like,

208
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:12,582
you know, not as as light as used to be.

209
00:18:12,602 --> 00:18:22,964
But it's, it's just, it's, it's definitely like a great thing to like, take my mind off, you know, the hectic things in life.

210
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:33,247
And, and then I get to meet so many great kids, boys and girls now, who, you know, give you a lot of faith that

211
00:18:34,360 --> 00:19:02,430
but you know, humanity is going to be fine because we have these amazing kids that come out and I see and it's and I'm at the point now where like I'm seeing kids from 10 years ago now who are getting married having kids and it's making me feel old but um well like again um it's nice to like pass on like what I've learned and have like a great experience with their lives and making for like

212
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:09,711
I'll bring up like John Curley, like I was when he came on, we had just lost, you know, our coach had just resigned.

213
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:13,113
And I was like, and you know, maybe it's, this is my chance to kind of get away.

214
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:20,178
I get a text message two days after he's hired, like, Hey, you know, I'm john Curley, can we meet, you know, meet it.

215
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,621
And, um, you know, for lunch at john brewers, I just want to talk to you.

216
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:29,424
And I'm like, all right, I'll, I'll give him, you know, I'll take the meeting.

217
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:30,925
I sat down, we talked.

218
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:35,309
Uh, at first I was like, yeah, we're going to hire this guy from Somerville.

219
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:39,530
And then I left that meeting and I texted a bunch of friends and I said, I think we found the guy.

220
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,031
I go, I just had lunch with this guy for two hours.

221
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:47,972
And the thing he said to me, he goes, I'm looking for a guy who can help me and be a partner.

222
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:54,894
And that's what he's kind of, you know, he doesn't, he hasn't looked at me as like, just like the head of the, like the, the parent's club.

223
00:19:55,254 --> 00:20:00,775
He's actually allowed me to come in and be with the kids, help him out coaching, be around.

224
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:09,844
And, you know, he's now to the point where my wife doesn't even like, she's like, all right, let's football stop.

225
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:18,866
But it is great to like, you know, we have some great kids to see them go off to college.

226
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:21,527
Last year, we had three kids go off to college.

227
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,428
I think we're gonna have a couple more this year.

228
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:30,406
to see them from like when you get them as freshmen to see how they built themselves up.

229
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:46,289
And I always say to parents, our goals are to make your children good athletes at the bottom, good students, and good citizens.

230
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:51,270
Those have been the three things that we always say.

231
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,190
These are our goals.

232
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,201
If we can, if we can leave here and your kids are those, those three things, they're going to be great.

233
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:00,042
Yeah.

234
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:00,722
Well, thank you.

235
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:00,942
Yeah.

236
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:02,283
That sounds, I agree.

237
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:13,686
I feel like team sports are a great setup for kind of just like learning how to work together, learning how to kind of push yourself, learning to care about something with other people and sort of take care of each other.

238
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:13,866
Right.

239
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:17,407
Like you also, you also get to meet people from like different walks of life.

240
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:18,167
Like I played with,

241
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:21,006
kids from all different walks of lives.

242
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:45,345
Like I played with a kid who immigrated from Russia, I played with a kid who immigrated from Haiti, kids who have immigrated from like Puerto, who have, you know, came from like Puerto Rico and other Latin, you learn their traditions, you learn, learn cool things about them, you learn, you know, I always say like, we don't, we don't have any males, we don't have any females, we don't have any white kids, we don't have any kids, we have mustaches.

243
00:21:45,932 --> 00:21:47,033
We all believe blue and white.

244
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:48,293
We're all Mustangs.

245
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:53,075
We're all while each other's equal and they treat each other great.

246
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:54,055
I love that.

247
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:56,216
That's great.

248
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:56,597
Yeah.

249
00:21:57,477 --> 00:22:00,778
So for the Thanksgiving Day game, what are the details that we need to know?

250
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:01,759
What time is the game?

251
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,921
So the game is at Malden this year is at 10 o'clock in the morning.

252
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:08,802
I believe tickets

253
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:12,026
believe I'll find out for you.

254
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:17,290
If you can buy tickets, I think you can buy tickets in advance at the athletic department, you're Mr. Maloney in this Perry.

255
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,693
And it's gonna be great.

256
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:33,580
You know, get there early because parking, parking is always that's the thing that stinks about like these places is like parking is never our field and Maldon fields aren't at the like our high schools.

257
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,641
So like parking isn't always the best.

258
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,423
So I would say get there early to get parking.

259
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,382
I want to tell you another funny, quick story about that I wrote down that I found really cool.

260
00:22:46,263 --> 00:22:52,265
So in it's about another day with with a claim about your two games.

261
00:22:53,245 --> 00:23:03,429
So I found reading about a story in 1917, in France during World War One, the 101st Division, which had a lot of guys from Massachusetts.

262
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:05,850
So apparently, Medford had this

263
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:21,154
former captain named Ed Larkin, who was a sergeant in the army, who organized, they found enough guys from Medford and Malden in this army division to play a football game off a battlefield in France.

264
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:26,715
While the war was going on, while they had like a ceasefire during Thanksgiving, they played this extra game.

265
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:34,317
And that was something that I really didn't know about, that I found out doing some research that I think was really cool that I wanted to,

266
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:37,897
throw in there for people to find out about.

267
00:23:39,438 --> 00:23:51,185
They claim that there was no score due to the, they didn't want to, they didn't want to publish the score due to morale, but I would like to hope to think that Mythic won.

268
00:23:52,508 --> 00:24:04,417
That's like very Massachusetts to me like people wild about their sports, their rivalries, they're like that even like during wartime enough in another country, they find a way to it's crazy.

269
00:24:04,457 --> 00:24:09,981
Like I met like a bunch of people from like, like I used to play semi pro football.

270
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,910
And I played for this team in Charlestown called the Townies.

271
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:26,762
And then we went to I went to a game in Vegas mostly because it was an excuse to go to Vegas when I was 22 years old, but I'm talking to guys from the Midwest, from the West, the South, and they're like, let's play Thanksgiving football.

272
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:28,444
What's with the Thanksgiving football thing?

273
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:35,670
Because it's really not like if you go outside of like, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, it's really not a thing like like Maine.

274
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,139
they're done with football next week, football's over, like their stage.

275
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:44,640
So it's like a very, like you said, you're right, it's like a very Massachusetts thing like this.

276
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:53,423
And it's sad, because there are teams that have actually like, moved away from the whole Thanksgiving football thing, like, and they play on like, Wednesday, Tuesday, Wednesday night now.

277
00:24:54,823 --> 00:24:59,665
And I'm like saying, like, I hope that never happens to us.

278
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:03,846
Because that whole like, waking up,

279
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:16,212
you know, so, so we always have route, we had a pep rally on Wednesday, you go into your last practice, then you go, you have a dinner, we call it a tradition dinner.

280
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:31,699
Um, but we have the team, the cheerleaders, there's some like, you know, the principal comes and invite guests and you know, you shake your last pump up and then you wake up early because you really haven't slept and then you go out, you're freezing cold most of the time.

281
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:45,831
I feel like every time it's in Medford, it's pretty nice, but every time we're in Malden, it's torture, which is weird because we have that river right there that usually flows like this whole, and then it's just a whole nostalgia.

282
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:49,992
And I can't imagine like playing it any other day.

283
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:54,173
It's weird to say, like, it's an experience like no other.

284
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:58,195
And I say to the kids, like, especially like our seniors,

285
00:25:59,215 --> 00:26:01,936
every time you do something, it's the last time you do it.

286
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:21,442
And then like you, it's really like, I remember, you know, we didn't win my senior year, but I remember every, and it's still kind of like haunts us, like, because we'll sit around and do the, you know, back in my day, we'll sit like, we'll always talk about, like, I might hate my 20th reunion the day after the game.

287
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:25,024
And sure, we'll get there, we'll talk about, we'll laugh about some things.

288
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:26,164
And then somebody will say, yeah, but

289
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:29,357
if we had beaten Malden, it would have been them all.

290
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:43,708
And that's how it is a lot of people like you, you, you remember, you may not remember what your score against some of them was, you may not remember what your score against Everett was, you may not remember, you remember what your scores against Malden were.

291
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:48,372
And I was lucky, like the first two we won, last two not so well.

292
00:26:48,653 --> 00:26:53,857
And I said to the, I always say to the kids, like, you don't want to feel like I felt for like, for after that game, you want to,

293
00:26:54,556 --> 00:26:56,037
You know, you want the turkey to taste good.

294
00:26:56,637 --> 00:26:57,017
Yeah.

295
00:26:57,477 --> 00:26:58,018
Oh, yeah.

296
00:26:58,638 --> 00:27:18,027
And also, I saw that you guys are selling some raffle tickets for the yes, yes, we are doing a we do every year we do a raffle where we raffle off some cash prizes, as well as our right now, who's great to us, donated a authentic Patriots throwback helmet.

297
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:18,948
That's one of the gifts.

298
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,471
So they're $10 a ticket.

299
00:27:22,811 --> 00:27:29,994
If you go to our Facebook metric Mustangs football, it's on there, just reach out to us, let us know and we'll we'll tell you how we can get your ticket.

300
00:27:30,074 --> 00:27:34,476
It's a it's a great it's a great raffle for the team.

301
00:27:35,616 --> 00:27:39,998
I think that's another thing that like people are like things are expensive.

302
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:44,680
We have a lot of great businesses in the city that have, you know, support us through like,

303
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:49,158
you know, advertising banners sponsoring dinners as well as a lot of a lot of people.

304
00:27:49,218 --> 00:27:58,901
So but it does take like a lot because like, where did you look at like the golf team might have like a dozen to 15 kids a soccer team might be like 20 kids.

305
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:01,382
We got over 50 miles to feed.

306
00:28:02,022 --> 00:28:09,845
We do a team dinner for them every week where they're able to sit down the night before the game and, and just relax, talk to each other learn stuff.

307
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:10,925
We take their phones away.

308
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:13,866
So we like they walk in, they put their phone down.

309
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:18,780
on a table and then they sit down, they talk to each other, they laugh.

310
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,200
It's really great.

311
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,883
So, you know, then like everything, you know, costs money and everything's expensive.

312
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:32,546
So anything that we raise, you know, really helps out and getting the kids shirts and jackets and awards.

313
00:28:32,606 --> 00:28:39,789
And so we really, I want to thank everybody that's, you know, that's helped us out and bought tickets already and been great to us.

314
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:41,590
Well, thanks, Chris.

315
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,510
Is there anything else you want to mention before we wrap up?

316
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:44,191
No.

317
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:56,536
Again, I thank you for letting me come on here and talk about the team and I hope that we'll see everybody there at Malvern.

318
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:58,597
It's going to be a great, it's going to be a great game.

319
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:01,699
We're going for our second winning season.

320
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:04,481
We haven't had back to back winning seasons in over 30 years.

321
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:07,242
So that's going to be, that'll be a great thing.

322
00:29:07,823 --> 00:29:08,863
Hopefully we can get it tonight.

323
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,445
So we don't have to worry about Thanksgiving.

324
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:11,985
Yeah.

325
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,008
And just like I said, it's a great team with a lot of great kids and an amazing coach.

326
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,273
Come on out to a game and go Mustangs.

327
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:26,194
Yeah.

328
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:26,755
All right.

329
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:27,396
