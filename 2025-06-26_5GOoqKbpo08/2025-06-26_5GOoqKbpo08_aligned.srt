00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:03,813
Good evening and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Memphis Community Development Board.

2
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:04,974
I'll call the meeting to order.

3
00:00:04,994 --> 00:00:07,735
Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

4
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:12,698
The hearing of the Memphis Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:23,245
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023.

6
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:29,108
A reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by assessing the link

7
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:32,890

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:40,873
If despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide real-time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible.

9
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:43,454
A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting,

10
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,610
Tonight, all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:56,332
Please know that you can assess all project materials for the project before the board, which can be reviewed on the city's website, which is medfordma.org.

12
00:00:57,032 --> 00:00:59,272
And you can look under current CD board filings.

13
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:03,313
And Danielle will also put the link in the chat.

14
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,555
I will do roll call attendance.

15
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:13,602
Vice chair.

16
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:15,423
Emily had a man present.

17
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:16,923
It accounts.

18
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:18,364
Present.

19
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,345
Are you fishmen present?

20
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,885
And Mariinsky present.

21
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:27,266
And myself, Jackie McPherson present.

22
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:31,588
Daniel, I want to introduce any city staff on the call.

23
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:38,150
Yes, myself, Daniel Evans, senior planner, Alicia Hunt, the director of

24
00:01:39,526 --> 00:01:40,946
planning, development, sustainability.

25
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:45,447
We have Columbia set who is our graduate student intern.

26
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:51,349
And I believe Todd Blake, the director of traffic and transportation is here.

27
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:52,349
Yeah, see Todd now.

28
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,811
Continuing to our first item this evening is 290 Salem Street, which is being continued on 417 24.

29
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:29,858
Um, it's a site plan review for special permit to allow the construction of three-story mixed-use building to contain seven residential units above ground for commercial space If we can please get a brief some overall summary Before the proponent goes if the city can please provide that update Um, yeah, so

30
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:51,485
We staff has been working with the applicant in the background in the interim between the meetings had an excellent working session with the architect plans have been revised and staff is satisfied and happy with them and recommending your board approve them.

31
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:07,541
Okay, and if I can please have the applicant present any changes that you may have.

32
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:14,252
Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board, Adam Barnosky with Roberto Israel & Weiner on behalf of the applicant.

33
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:19,656
We also have Jacob Levine here to walk through the changes that were made.

34
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:23,718
As I understand it, the city might have the ability to share screen.

35
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,039
He can walk through the changes.

36
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:34,886
This is mostly out of the legal realm and really related to the design and comments that were made from the board and the changes that have been made since the last meeting.

37
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,108
So, if Jacob is available, he can walk through that.

38
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:49,930
So I could allow him to share the screen or does he not have the ability, technical abilities, as I'm happy to share my screen, but we could give that ability to him if he needed it.

39
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,491
I think he doesn't have the ability.

40
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:52,171
Okay.

41
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:53,332
Yeah, if you could.

42
00:03:53,392 --> 00:03:59,535
No problem.

43
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:07,219
Can everybody see that?

44
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:24,852
Okay, thank you, Madam Chair and everybody this is Jacob will be in our tech from us a hospital.

45
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:41,820
I apologize that I can't share the screen myself tonight I'm kind of on the move, but I've been working digitally with the city to revise this drawing set, and really specifically looking at the top left corner and studying how we could do a better job of grounding the building.

46
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,142
along with just trying to unify the facades.

47
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:51,424
If you wouldn't mind just starting to scroll down through the images, I can share what's been updated.

48
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:55,426
Starting really with the site plan has been updated.

49
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,988
On the top left corner, you'll see a black 90-degree shape.

50
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:10,473
Essentially, we're going to propose about a four-foot barrier to shield the cars from Park Street, so those coming down Park Street won't have such an open view of the cars.

51
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:16,726
So that's represented in the top left corner adjacent to the sidewalk and the parking spots.

52
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:17,786
Exactly.

53
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:22,329
Parking has been revised a little bit to really fit underneath the building better.

54
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:30,833
In terms of the cars closest to the building, we also revised the footprint of the building, which we'll get into as we continue to move through this presentation.

55
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:35,496
So if you wouldn't mind just kind of going to the landscape side.

56
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:37,117
Yep, yep.

57
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:40,223
Perfect.

58
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:47,490
So on the landscape side, you can kind of see that corner in the top left to shield the parking.

59
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:55,359
We improved the landscape on the Park Street side itself, and we pulled the wall, which you'll see in the architectural prints.

60
00:05:56,284 --> 00:06:00,666
to cover bike storage and those cars closest to the building.

61
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:05,887
So the building has more of a portal now instead of being up on stilts on the background.

62
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:13,850
So we have all of our drawings now match in terms of the site layout, site configuration, landscape plan.

63
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:15,671
So if we can continue on.

64
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:30,138
And now you can kind of see on the left side where we have the row of parking and the bike storage, that black line on the left with the door did not exist before.

65
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:34,039
So we really did create more of an entry.

66
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:39,340
And if you could see the car in the top left corner, there's this small three by two little bite there.

67
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:49,323
That's kind of going to hide the column and even do a better job at, you know, bringing the building down to scale, which I'll show you out in the elevations and the 3D images that are coming.

68
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:51,145
So we could continue on.

69
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,410
Nothing changed here.

70
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:05,790
So on the elevations, we're specifically looking now at the 3D image on the bottom right and the elevation bottom right.

71
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:16,356
You can see now how I kind of brought the facial board that was below the 2nd floor down across the lowest floor to really create that portal.

72
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:21,260
You can see the 4 foot brick fence or stone fence, whatever it might be.

73
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,761
covering the parking.

74
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:34,666
And then you can see that corner that I was discussing, which kind of looks like a bigger anchored column, and then the upgraded wall to cover the bike storage as well.

75
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:44,050
So that whole facade is now just almost added, you know, the entire coverage of most of my bike storage for security reasons.

76
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,711
And now my parking is mostly shielded coming down Park Street.

77
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:48,592
And I'm

78
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:52,994
fairly confident that we did a good job not blocking any views coming out.

79
00:07:53,415 --> 00:08:03,800
I think we want to play with the scale of the stone and stuff and make sure that it stands out and we still have some signage so that pedestrians know what's to come.

80
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,542
If you could just go to my last slide.

81
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,224
That one hasn't changed.

82
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:13,946
Reiterated that.

83
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:20,644
I just want to show the 3D images so now you can kind of see the top left corner.

84
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:26,514
image, all of that brick scape and that double storefront in the back is all new.

85
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:29,815
And then you could see the column enclosure in that back left corner.

86
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,055
And then again, our small four foot fence.

87
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:46,898
So we're confident our driver would be able to kind of see over that fence, have a safe pull out and still have a safe pull in and really try to do a better job at, you know, what everyone's been asking for is the massing and the grounding to the site itself.

88
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,231
Those are our upgrades.

89
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,352
The floor plans themselves didn't change.

90
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:53,754
How the building sits on the site didn't change.

91
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,516
We've just been working with the town on looking at that corner.

92
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:11,885
We also just, as you can see in this top left corner shot, looking at maybe where the balconies are, doing a matching composite material with the curtain wall corner just to break up that all gray massing when it's all time.

93
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,226
I just want to point that out too.

94
00:09:14,246 --> 00:09:15,787
That was a good recommendation by the city.

95
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:35,328
And I really appreciate everything and and any questions anyone has we'll be happy to answer Thank you very much jacob But before I open up to the board, I just want to commend you guys on

96
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:42,002
The differences between the first plans and these plans are significant.

97
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,103
It may not be 100%, right?

98
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:50,964
But it's also at the point where we can see how much you've worked with the city to move forward.

99
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:58,526
And I, for one, can appreciate that, especially with that curtain wall corner that we were concerned with the privacy.

100
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:00,967
And then the whole idea of the

101
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,962
how an actual passerby will see the space.

102
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:08,662
So I can appreciate that.

103
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:12,384
I will open it up to the board for any other questions or concerns.

104
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,087
No questions or concerns?

105
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:24,949
No follow-up questions?

106
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,652
Does the plan address overall concerns for the board?

107
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,990
Hi, Jackie, I have my hand up.

108
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:37,571
Oh, sorry.

109
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:37,631
Hi.

110
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:42,893
Hi Emily, Vice Chair Hedeman.

111
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:47,235
Through the chair, I think that those modifications are a great compromise.

112
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:53,578
I really appreciate the work that the applicant did with the city to address our concerns.

113
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:57,400
So, you know, I commend a job well done.

114
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,663
I did hear the comment about changing the materiality of the balconies and I just wanted to flag that

115
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:13,693
see if that's something we need to condition, to make sure that the applicant doesn't have to come back, just to kind of cover all of our bases.

116
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:18,794
But other than that, job well done.

117
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:20,675
Thank you for all your work on this.

118
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:29,157
Does the city have any advice on that?

119
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:32,052
you.

120
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:32,852
Um, Madam chair.

121
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:36,834
I believe that director Hunt and I have been discussing, um.

122
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:50,539
In light that we don't have, um, like a minor administrative review process that's codified no ordinance, but we could condition, um, language that would.

123
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:51,820
Allow

124
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:11,944
We were trying to create like some boilerplate language, but we could also really put some guardrails on what they can change with staff approval.

125
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:14,566
So I would leave that to you all.

126
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:24,254
And as for the special permit, are we still concerned with the parking?

127
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:26,216
That's one of the questions that I have.

128
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:31,380
I know that there was maybe condition tenants

129
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,352
only of that particular address could use it?

130
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:38,232
Is that something that we're still working with?

131
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:43,875
I'm trying to call up the condition document.

132
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,937
I know that we added that to another property.

133
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:58,821
Do you mean, so one of the condition that we've started adding to the around parking has been

134
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:07,319
that residents of this building would not be eligible for resident permit parking.

135
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,542
We just leave it blanketly like that.

136
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:15,305
And this might be a location that doesn't have resident permit parking right now.

137
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:22,130
But we're saying to the property owner is do not tell your tenants that you'll always be able to just park on these streets.

138
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,814
Because if permit parking goes into effect, this building won't be eligible for it.

139
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:30,576
You think you have enough parking on site.

140
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,979
like you have to put your money where your mouth is.

141
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:51,372
And I will advise it in Somerville, it's a very common condition and it's commonly monitored that all advertising for buildings indicate like that this apartments are not eligible for resident permit parking.

142
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:56,176
People still wanna live in Somerville though.

143
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:18,713
And to address Emily's like we you could actually put in a condition that says, you know, minor changes to the balconies and other aesthetics on the side could be approved by.

144
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:28,700
staff without returning to the CD board, because we don't literally have it in our zoning right now to say that what's not necessary to come back.

145
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:36,706
And then the staff could just say like, Oh, that's a dramatic change that that's outside of our authority.

146
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:43,671
You know, you can say, you know, minor changes, you know, can be done by can be approved by the staff.

147
00:14:55,098 --> 00:15:03,470
Hearing no further, seeing no further questions or hands raised from the board, because it is a public hearing, I will open it up for public comment.

148
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:10,136
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

149
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:13,679
You can also send an email to OCD at MedfordMA.org.

150
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,202
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

151
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:23,847
A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

152
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:30,553
However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

153
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:36,587
Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

154
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:53,334
I haven't received any comments or emails from this lately, and I don't see anyone with a hand raised that's on the Zoom call.

155
00:15:54,054 --> 00:16:00,637
Let me check email one more time.

156
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:11,517
I don't see anything there.

157
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:22,641
I don't see anything in the OCD general mailbox either.

158
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:34,625
I will close the public comment period for this meeting and open it back up for deliberation between the board.

159
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:45,001
One of the things I wanted to leave with is I remember hearing this previously, and it was conditioned to the point where it was almost a different project.

160
00:16:45,061 --> 00:17:00,785
So the fact that the applicant has addressed all of those issues and the concerns regarding the staff who has worked with the city, as well as addressed all of the additional input from the board, I have nothing further.

161
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:18,174
So at this point, if the board has anything further to say, other than that, I would look for a motion for the first part to approve the site plan for 290 Salem Street.

162
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:25,516
So I have the conditions document from prior.

163
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:28,417
I just dropped it into the shared folder.

164
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:30,198
Hopefully you guys can see that.

165
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:50,873
that has all of the comments from engineering, and the fire department, which are mostly standard conditions, and then the health department's standard conditions.

166
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:58,257
There was the one condition from Director Blake about

167
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:14,579
you're considering reserving one of the parking spaces for the commercial use, but if you're going to, I mean, so that's something you consider if you think it's necessary or not.

168
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:22,023
And then the other condition that you were just talking about restricting the resident parking permits.

169
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:28,466
Because the special permit is for retail uses until the city updates are allowed for that corridor, correct?

170
00:18:30,398 --> 00:18:32,779
Is that what we're doing a special permit for?

171
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,900
Yeah, the special permit is for the, so it'll be retail.

172
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,462
So you're asking for us to condition a space, a parking space we save for that commercial use?

173
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,884
That was a comment from Director Blank.

174
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:50,324
Oh, he's here.

175
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,455
Oh, and also member Calves also has his hand raised.

176
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:06,456
Yes.

177
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:09,918
No, I was just waiting for you to.

178
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,861
Peter Calves?

179
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:17,225
No, sorry.

180
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:22,129
I was just going to read back the conditions, but as we're adding more of them, so.

181
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:23,169
Okay.

182
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:29,535
Peter, can you actually read what you have?

183
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:32,615
so far?

184
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:34,677
Sure.

185
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:58,572
So far, based on what we've discussed this evening, I have conditioned that minor changes to the aesthetics and materials of the building can be approved by staff, by city staff, without having to be returned to this board, conditioned that residents of the

186
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:20,906
building would not be eligible for resident permit parking, and this would be evident in advertising for leases in the building, and that the developers shall meet recommendations as set forth by city department heads.

187
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:23,948
And that's as far as I got.

188
00:20:30,957 --> 00:20:41,487
And so for the board to discuss the condition as recommended by director Blake, that would not be captured in recommendations that would have to be fleshed out for the parking space.

189
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,289
Yes, correct.

190
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,291
I would consider that a separate condition.

191
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:54,220
When I am saying city department heads recommendations, that's primarily the boilerplate language from the health department, the building department, fire department, et cetera.

192
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:56,870
Understood.

193
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,430
Thank you.

194
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:00,431
And so how does the board overall feel about?

195
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:20,738
Director blake's Recommendation to condition a parking space for commercial use only Director blake.

196
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:25,019
I don't know if you want uh, uh, pardon me, uh vice chair heteman

197
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:26,726
sure.

198
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:31,350
Um, this might be controversial, but I don't think it's necessary.

199
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,675
I mean, there's, there's what seven units and how many parking spaces regret.

200
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:41,900
We have eight parking spaces and seven units.

201
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,364
Yeah, I don't think it's necessary.

202
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:50,567
I mean, maybe one of those parking spaces as a visitor spot for the residents.

203
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:53,690
But

204
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,210
I don't think it's necessary.

205
00:21:55,431 --> 00:22:01,033
Oh, interested in other feedback from other board members though.

206
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:05,314
I have no opinion either way.

207
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:14,658
Either way, I was going to offer if Director Blake could better explain that condition and reasons for it.

208
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:18,159
Yeah, this is kind of lessons learned.

209
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:27,352
There was a mixed use development with residential above and the office use that end up becoming a dentist's office below and then city ends up getting.

210
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:52,266
complaints or questions regarding the employees of the dentist's office or visitor of that dentist's office so it's just being mindful of that and since it was eight verse in the seven units it still allows one per unit for residential use so it was just trying to be mindful of that because if as Alicia pointed out the parking conditions change on street in the future say the side streets are resident permanent

211
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:57,269
And then Salem Street itself is for customer turnover.

212
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:05,715
Sometimes we have these issues with employee parking, which, again, as other people pointed out, they could also take bike, bus, walk, and things like that.

213
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:08,077
But one out of eight seemed reasonable.

214
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:09,778
Anyways, that was the thought process.

215
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,860
But whatever the board decides, fine.

216
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:14,942
Thank you, Director Blake.

217
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:17,264
Ari Fishman?

218
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:22,488
Thank you, and thank you, Director Blake, for the additional context.

219
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,473
I appreciate the lessons learned.

220
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:37,337
I think that like Vice Chair Hedeman, I'm not completely sold, but I think one potential in-between option is that

221
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,512
having some sort of distinction between daytime use and nighttime use.

222
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:50,094
Many residents will need a place to park their car overnight, presumably most of the mixed uses during the day.

223
00:23:50,114 --> 00:24:00,578
I don't know if there is any mechanisms we have that can utilize that distinction to decrease parking tension in the neighborhood.

224
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:07,160
And I leave it to people who know more about parking policy mechanisms than I do.

225
00:24:12,355 --> 00:24:13,176
Vice Chair Heidemann?

226
00:24:15,617 --> 00:24:23,702
I see that Peter has his hand up, and as he's the transportation expert, I'm going to defer to him before wasting any time on what I have to say.

227
00:24:24,522 --> 00:24:25,123
Peter Klaus?

228
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:33,148
I was going to just continue the discussion on what Aria was saying.

229
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:41,753
I don't think we can be as specific as you would need, because especially now,

230
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:49,116
post-COVID with a lot of work from home, you can't guarantee that people will be in a certain place at a certain time.

231
00:24:49,136 --> 00:25:07,329
And I don't, while I appreciate the sentiment, I don't know that that's something that would be possible to regulate, at least not in terms of, or would not be possible to regulate on the property itself.

232
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:09,270
You can certainly have,

233
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:35,458
when they when we look when the city looks at street parking you can certainly have basically what would be resident only for a timed for at a overnight time but and then commercial during the day but i don't think on the on the property itself and one of the off streets on especially not only one of the spots you could really do that feasibly but that's just my take

234
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,422
Vice Chair Hanneman, did you want to speak again?

235
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:48,604
Yeah, I agree with Peter.

236
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:50,906
I think it's kind of an overreach.

237
00:25:52,407 --> 00:26:00,593
If we do want to say business, then we'll say business, but I don't think we need to regulate this for this property.

238
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:12,283
And for all we know, the applicant themselves may decide to determine that it's a business only spot, but I don't think

239
00:26:12,753 --> 00:26:14,116
I think that's an overreach by us.

240
00:26:20,568 --> 00:26:21,230
Director Blake.

241
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:24,708
Yeah, I'm happy with whatever the board decides.

242
00:26:24,728 --> 00:26:31,213
Just additional context is there is a mechanism as Peter alluded to in that other example I gave with the dentist's office.

243
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:35,277
We did two hour except by permit daytime, overnight permit only.

244
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:37,279
So that helps with customers.

245
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:42,083
And then with employees, they could get a business permit that negates the two hours as well.

246
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:43,604
So there are other mechanisms.

247
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:49,609
It's just in the past that has come up where the businesses aren't necessarily accounted for in terms of

248
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:51,117
providing for them.

249
00:26:51,557 --> 00:26:51,737
Yeah.

250
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:56,459
So either way, it's, it seems like there's different ways to handle it.

251
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:04,381
In terms of enforcement, I agree with Peter that to sign it for certain hours, you know, it's probably unlikely that you could enforce any such thing.

252
00:27:04,782 --> 00:27:14,765
So the only way, even in this process requiring one of the, to be business, it's really only tied to this permit process and maybe it could be, you know, deeded.

253
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:18,246
Otherwise nobody's going to be going on some property checking anyways, really.

254
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:40,267
So it sounds like overall for the board, for this item, we're gonna defer to the applicant, the property owner to handle the parking in this case.

255
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:52,073
So for the criteria to approve the site plan, if I can, Peter, not to put this back on you, but as the clerk,

256
00:27:52,962 --> 00:28:03,465
If I can ask for a motion with the conditions that you have collected, it seems as though the city is okay with those conditions as stated previously.

257
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:17,950
All right, so I will move to approve the special permit site plan review with the conditions that minor changes to the

258
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:44,614
Build minor changes to the project can be approved by staff as their discretion that residents of the proposed project would not be eligible for resident permit parking and that the advertising for the units would reflect this and that the applicant shall meet the recommendations set forth by city department heads.

259
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:54,434
Is there a... So that's PETA's motion.

260
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:57,397
Is there a motion to accept, a second motion?

261
00:28:57,997 --> 00:28:58,778
I'll second it.

262
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:03,843
So going back, Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

263
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,765
We're voting, right?

264
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:07,387
Yes, we're going to vote.

265
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:08,088
Okay, aye.

266
00:29:08,128 --> 00:29:08,408
Sorry.

267
00:29:09,329 --> 00:29:10,010
PETA cows?

268
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:10,971
Aye.

269
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:13,423
Maryasky.

270
00:29:13,443 --> 00:29:14,484
Aye.

271
00:29:15,124 --> 00:29:15,845
Ari Fishman.

272
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:16,886
Aye.

273
00:29:17,707 --> 00:29:25,434
And because I was absent during the last meeting, but I have, I am attestant to the fact that I have watched the meeting in full.

274
00:29:25,874 --> 00:29:29,037
I am, I am also now eligible to vote and I'm an aye.

275
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:42,344
Now to discuss, this is also a special permit to make sure that there are no adverse effects that will outweigh the beneficial impacts.

276
00:29:43,484 --> 00:30:01,027
And that's looking at the social economic community needs, traffic flow and safety, adequacy of utilities and public services, compatibility with the size, scale and design of other structures in the neighborhood, impacts on the natural environment, and the proposal's compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan.

277
00:30:03,957 --> 00:30:08,239
What I can say is that it's way better than what's there now, and it will definitely transform the area.

278
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:19,226
So I would look for a motion to approve the special permit to allow for the retail use at 290 Salem Street.

279
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:22,007
So moved.

280
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:26,410
A second motion.

281
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:33,180
I ask for the motion, then a board member.

282
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,063
I can't give the motion myself, so Peter has given the motion.

283
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,644
I second it.

284
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,047
Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

285
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:43,049
Aye.

286
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,110
Peter Cowles?

287
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:46,592
Aye.

288
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:48,393
Ari Fishman?

289
00:30:49,254 --> 00:30:49,394
Aye.

290
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:51,195
Pam Marianski?

291
00:30:52,336 --> 00:30:52,437
Aye.

292
00:30:53,197 --> 00:30:55,039
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

293
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:03,152
Thank you, Attorney Banowski and to the applicant and everyone else that represents the applicant, we appreciate it.

294
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:05,494
Thank you all for your time, we appreciate it.

295
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:12,899
Thank you.

296
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:19,704
The second item for tonight is 142 Mystic Avenue, Great American Bear Hall to amend the approved site plan.

297
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,843
It's a public hearing, so I will read the notice again.

298
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:30,230
The Memphis Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on May 15, 2024, after 6.30 p.m.

299
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:36,456
via Zoom, remote video conferencing relative to a modification to an approved site plan review at 142 Mystic Ave.

300
00:31:38,048 --> 00:31:38,989
Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

301
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:56,422
The petitioner, Brian Zother, on behalf of Great American Bear Hall, LLC, proposes modifications to the access drive location, parking layout, and internal circulation drive aisles in order to comply with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation's approved access drive location.

302
00:31:57,002 --> 00:32:06,830
In addition, the petitioner seeks approval of signage that exceeds allowances of section 94, 6.2, which is under the headline of signs of the Medford zoning ordinance.

303
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:11,577
if I can please, if the board can please have an update from the city?

304
00:32:14,158 --> 00:32:21,803
Madam chair, before we start this, I believe vice chair Hedeman needs to leave for a work meeting.

305
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:27,986
We thank her for being present for the 290 Salem due to the quorum issues.

306
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:36,771
So we do have a quorum, so it would be Jackie, Peter, Ari and Pam are still here.

307
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:40,223
which is a quorum so that we can proceed.

308
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:42,363
But I want the record to reflect that.

309
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:44,184
Bye.

310
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:45,384
Have a nice evening, everyone.

311
00:32:45,504 --> 00:32:45,804
Thank you.

312
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:46,525
Have a good night.

313
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:56,087
And yes, I will introduce the project.

314
00:32:58,008 --> 00:32:59,909
So this was before you.

315
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:05,355
I've lost track of time, several months ago, I believe.

316
00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:06,856
That's a year ago.

317
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:09,178
A year ago, the second time you came back?

318
00:33:09,618 --> 00:33:12,040
Yeah, the third time.

319
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,743
Yeah, the second time was when the plans were more fully developed.

320
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:24,469
And so I believe the members who have seen this is Jackie and maybe Ari or Peter, I'm not sure.

321
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,813
But this is a new- I believe this was one of Ari and my first meetings.

322
00:33:29,293 --> 00:33:29,513
Okay.

323
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:31,495
Yes, I remember seeing this.

324
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:42,701
But either way, it's a new public hearing, so anything from the past, it doesn't matter that you weren't present for all those discussions.

325
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:56,664
But anyways, during the permitting process with the state, because it's a state road, they needed to get an access permit, and they actually did not grant the location that

326
00:33:58,097 --> 00:34:17,534
was proposed originally, so the driveway is further north on the site, which required changing the circulation and the landscaping, and it's not de minimis, so this needs to come back before you for an amendment.

327
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:20,536
And also, because some of the circulation changes

328
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:26,653
I think are actually for the better within the site, actually eliminates the need for some of the conditions.

329
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:33,236
So we will be amending some of those conditions to eliminate some as they're no longer necessary.

330
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:37,919
So I'm Brian Zarthur.

331
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:46,163
I'm the applicant for the Great American Beer Hall, but I am going to hand this off to Michael Giuliano and Ben Minnix of Eagle Brook to explain the changes we had to make.

332
00:34:48,743 --> 00:34:49,323
Great, thank you.

333
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:51,544
This is Ben Minnix with Eagle Brook Engineering.

334
00:34:52,345 --> 00:34:54,346
Danielle, if I could, please share my screen.

335
00:34:54,406 --> 00:34:56,907
I'd like to go over the two site plans.

336
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,131
I believe we should have sharing ability now.

337
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:10,273
There we go.

338
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:10,973
Can you still hear me?

339
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:12,514
Yes.

340
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:14,035
Okay, so...

341
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:19,859
What I'm showing here is the site plan previously approved.

342
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,301
I'll just show this quickly so you can see some comparison with the new proposal.

343
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:29,523
So this is the building which is still proposed in the same location.

344
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:37,527
Approximately 18,000 square foot footprint with a proposed patio in this area here towards the south.

345
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:49,439
and through the middle of the site with the driveway that was not approved is a two-way in-and-out driveway and then parking along the north sideline of the property.

346
00:35:51,280 --> 00:36:06,066
As Danielle mentioned, this driveway location was not approved by Massachusetts Department of Transportation, so we had to go back to the drawing board with the location that DOT suggested and did finally approve.

347
00:36:07,494 --> 00:36:13,097
I'll go to the current proposal, and if you have any questions, I can always jump back to this.

348
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:30,665
So this is the current proposal, which was reviewed by Department of Transportation, Medford Engineering, and circulated among the departments for agreement.

349
00:36:32,014 --> 00:36:35,217
So the building, as previously mentioned, is in the same location.

350
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:43,204
However, this driveway entrance, a two-way entrance and exit, has moved north on Mystic Avenue.

351
00:36:44,405 --> 00:36:47,047
There is a one-way circulation through the site.

352
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:49,929
We have a 24-foot wide drive aisle.

353
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:54,053
Again, still one-way, but parking on both sides of that drive aisle.

354
00:36:55,695 --> 00:37:03,398
And then vehicles will exit around the north and then drive south on the exit drive aisle and exit at the driveway entrance.

355
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:14,162
DOT wanted crosswalks replaced and moved on Nesta Gap and across Hancock Street.

356
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:20,765
So we've coordinated with that to have circulation to the site for pedestrians.

357
00:37:21,465 --> 00:37:31,009
from Mystic Ave and Hancock Street so they can access via an ADA path to the building along the front of the building and to the proposed patio area.

358
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:45,155
We have additional landscaping with this proposal, approximately 1,100 square feet of additional landscaping and 1,700 square feet of open space, and that's not including any of the open patio.

359
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:57,755
In speaking with Danielle, the last couple of weeks, it was suggested that we add a landscaped island here, so there's no more than 20 parking spaces within a row along the front of the building.

360
00:37:58,815 --> 00:38:02,017
We also increased the width of the landscaping along the north side.

361
00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:05,299
Previously, it was 5.6 feet of spacing.

362
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:06,680
Now we have 7.5 feet.

363
00:38:10,342 --> 00:38:12,103
Mike or Brian, did I miss anything?

364
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,211
That's great.

365
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:23,374
This is Mike Giuliano with Eagle Brook.

366
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:30,158
And the parking spaces, as far as the number from what was previously approved to what is currently proposed, is the same.

367
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:45,148
So I'd be happy to turn it over with any questions or if you want to see additional sheets or anything.

368
00:38:49,556 --> 00:38:56,817
Although we saw this a while, I will tell you that this came in so late that I have not wrapped my head around the differences.

369
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:07,139
It would help for me anyways, just to help to speed this a little, to provide more time, not without just in haste.

370
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:11,260
I don't wanna do anything in haste, but at the same time, I need to be able to wrap this around my head.

371
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,520
Can you please compare the changes?

372
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,101
I need to better understand what these changes are.

373
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:18,046
Sure.

374
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:22,568
If I put them side by side, tell me if you can see it or if you can't see it.

375
00:39:24,748 --> 00:39:26,769
Maybe it'll be too small, but I'll give it a shot.

376
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:33,892
Are you able to see two site plans now?

377
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:34,672
Yes.

378
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:42,815
So we'll start with the driveway entrance.

379
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,142
And you can see the location in reference to Hancock Street across the street.

380
00:39:48,242 --> 00:39:52,384
So previously, the driveway was proposed a little bit closer to Hancock Street.

381
00:39:53,064 --> 00:40:04,449
DOT did not want that location, one for it being closer to Hancock Street and with the new striping layout and traffic controls that are going on Mystic Ave.

382
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,572
So the driveway was proposed farther north, farther away from Hancock Street.

383
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:23,542
Now going into the site, the parking layout has almost flipped 180 degrees instead of parking opposite the drive aisle.

384
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:28,546
Now we're parking along the building with a one-way drive aisle all the way around.

385
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:31,968
So instead of a two-way drive aisle, we have a one-way all around the site.

386
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:37,673
And we also provide greater width on the north sideline of the property.

387
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:39,586
Those are the major changes.

388
00:40:40,227 --> 00:40:43,812
Again, under parking spaces for both the previous layout and the current.

389
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:51,242
Thank you.

390
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:52,864
Director Hunt.

391
00:40:55,077 --> 00:41:19,772
I'm wondering if it would, since Mr. Minix is presenting that from an engineering perspective, from the layman's perspective, what we were seeing here is that it was that there was a parking lot and then a drive aisle between the parking lot, like a driveway, a road between the parking lot and the building, and everybody who parked had to cross across that.

392
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:29,676
And the changing of this layout now means that approximately half the spaces will actually be up against the building.

393
00:41:29,996 --> 00:41:30,936
I'm not exactly right.

394
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,697
There'll be the sidewalk and a buffer.

395
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:41,621
But everybody who parks on that side of the parking lot will not have to cross either the parking lot or any drive lanes.

396
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:46,403
They can get out of the car and step and walk right up onto the sidewalk next to the building.

397
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:52,245
And then the other half will park across just the parking lot.

398
00:41:52,605 --> 00:42:05,129
And so that the through driveline where people are likely to drive faster because it's just a straight shot through with no parking is actually up against the edge of the property.

399
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:10,812
And there's no reason for anybody to ever be walking over there because it is just a drive aisle.

400
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:14,593
So we were looking at it in the office as if this is actually

401
00:42:15,253 --> 00:42:25,082
safer and more friendly for pedestrians because of having the parking lot closer to the building and the one way drive aisle further away.

402
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:33,329
I'm wondering if that's, I know I'm sort of put opinion into that, but I just wanted to like, that's how we were seeing this, these changes.

403
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:39,975
It also allows for all the handicapped parking to be right up along the building area.

404
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:50,330
And anybody who's in mobility, having mobility issues can get out of their vehicles, that's the part you're seeing there, and then get right up onto the sidewalk.

405
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:58,274
So we actually saw this as having some significant safety improvements for the way this is laid out.

406
00:42:59,855 --> 00:43:01,756
And DOT is kind of making them.

407
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:10,420
I mean, obviously, I didn't like the idea that DOT was making them do anything against what we had already approved.

408
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:16,044
But once I saw their new layout, I kind of was able to get over that.

409
00:43:18,606 --> 00:43:20,207
Madam Chair, if I may.

410
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:20,987
Yes.

411
00:43:21,508 --> 00:43:25,811
I just want to concur that yeah, when I first saw it, I remember thinking,

412
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:28,385
oh, gosh, change, don't know.

413
00:43:28,785 --> 00:43:31,487
But then opening it and being like, oh, I actually like this better.

414
00:43:33,248 --> 00:43:41,996
The only bugger is that the permit that MassDOT gave is restricting the left turn out.

415
00:43:42,016 --> 00:43:44,378
I don't know if that was mentioned yet.

416
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,500
I'm trying to figure out egress.

417
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,182
And it's kind of hard.

418
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:52,945
That's the one thing.

419
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:55,687
So what's the egress situation?

420
00:43:57,305 --> 00:44:00,008
So this is the main entrance to the building here.

421
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:02,290
We have another door here.

422
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:10,317
Over here, over here is a back, most likely worker entrance.

423
00:44:11,558 --> 00:44:13,320
There are also doors along the patio here.

424
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:16,062
So we have a sidewalk going all along the building.

425
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:22,048
Sidewalk and bike rack here with ADA access through to Mystic Ave sidewalk.

426
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:35,144
And as far as the right turn only out of here, I'll show the approved DOT plans here.

427
00:44:35,864 --> 00:44:44,134
So along with the site improvements, DOT is requiring additional striping and paving on Mystic Ave.

428
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:54,645
And I believe the reason for the right turn only is to comply with the layout of the striping and traffic flow on Mystic Ave.

429
00:44:54,685 --> 00:45:00,908
So they have a double yellow line in hatching here, so you'd have to take a right out of the site on Mystic Ave.

430
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:10,453
And not because it's in the same family, but Danielle, if I'm not mistaken, Atlas is built the same, right turn only, correct?

431
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:11,774
When you come out?

432
00:45:13,442 --> 00:45:23,051
I'll defer to Director Blake on what the permit access is for next door.

433
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,373
Okay.

434
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:27,316
People can turn left out of Atlas.

435
00:45:27,816 --> 00:45:28,697
You can turn?

436
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:29,598
Yes, yes, yeah.

437
00:45:31,127 --> 00:45:32,128
Yeah, I can't recall this.

438
00:45:32,508 --> 00:45:39,313
I do want to point out, in addition to what Danielle said, the permit for mass that also restricts left turns in.

439
00:45:39,814 --> 00:45:43,497
So essentially, it's only right out and only right in.

440
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:46,259
That's the permit language.

441
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:49,261
Right.

442
00:45:49,982 --> 00:45:56,487
My take is that it's because of that striping and traffic pattern that they have throughout the middle of Mystic Avenue.

443
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:05,582
Madam Chair, if I might ask Director Blake, is there any chance that we're gonna have any influence over that?

444
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:10,644
Because from an economic development and city perspective, I don't like it.

445
00:46:12,365 --> 00:46:17,267
And I didn't like, we didn't in our office even know that this was happening.

446
00:46:17,287 --> 00:46:22,749
So, and I do know that it's at this time, it's all paint, right?

447
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:26,150
It's not like anybody is building a median or something.

448
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,101
From what I could see, it is paint.

449
00:46:31,362 --> 00:46:35,546
There is a sign on the property that R3-2, this is no left turn out.

450
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:39,110
It doesn't appear that there's a no left turn in sign.

451
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:51,563
Yeah, I didn't know if we wanna delve into the traffic piece here or continue with the site and the improvement shown on this plant first or however, which way people wanna approach that.

452
00:46:55,455 --> 00:46:56,817
Sorry, I got held up.

453
00:46:57,919 --> 00:47:01,844
I was looking at the transportation so you can however you want to proceed.

454
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:05,528
I just wanted to there was some clarifying questions to wrap my head around.

455
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:14,223
Okay, so basically I tend to agree with Alicia and Danielle in my personal opinion for the site layout itself.

456
00:47:14,884 --> 00:47:17,365
It's equal or a little better than the previous probably.

457
00:47:17,445 --> 00:47:21,788
So yeah, that's a good side effect of these changes.

458
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:23,950
There were a couple of very minor things.

459
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:31,315
The exit where the two arrows are in and out to the dead end parking area, there should probably be a stop sign and stop line there.

460
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:45,163
And then the exit out from the one-way drive, same thing, stop line, stop sign, and possibly do not enter sign so that someone coming in from Mystic doesn't accidentally go left of the island, even though there is a keep right.

461
00:47:46,277 --> 00:47:49,701
And that's just minor things, signage.

462
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:57,128
So then the people exiting would stop and kind of yield to anyone coming in from the main drive.

463
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,511
So that's for the site.

464
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,594
Everything else, Danielle and Alicia said, I agree with.

465
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:07,938
So off-site, we could probably go back to the mass.page.

466
00:48:11,568 --> 00:48:15,312
So offsite, yeah, they likely add those restrictions.

467
00:48:15,372 --> 00:48:23,559
I can't speak for them, but it's probably a safety concern they have for the turning restrictions, but it does have impacts to the city for other things.

468
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,505
Briefly, I'll talk about the plan shown here, all the markings.

469
00:48:29,525 --> 00:48:36,431
They did accommodate, it looks like Matt's thought agreed with my suggestion in one of the conditions to, you know,

470
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:42,344
dropped the second lane on Mystic Gap northbound before reaching Hancock Street.

471
00:48:42,664 --> 00:48:57,136
So then by the time a vehicle reaches Hancock Street, especially the crosswalk, they're already in a single lane northbound instead of two lanes, because two lanes are more challenging for safety for a crosswalk than one lane.

472
00:48:57,857 --> 00:49:00,799
We get more compliance with one lane for people yielding.

473
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,922
So that's a good change so that that occurred.

474
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:18,170
I would note on this plan it does show the proposed RRFBs for the crosswalk, which was in my original condition recommendations, but it wasn't part of the original approval, but MassDOT apparently required that as well.

475
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,472
So one on each side of the street, so that's good.

476
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:27,115
So yeah, the downside is because of those restrictions,

477
00:49:28,988 --> 00:49:36,657
you know, it's pushing all the entries and exits to a particular side of Mystic Abbey, the north side, the south side, right?

478
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:48,071
So basically when people exit the driveway, instead of being able to take a left, if they're destined to the south, Somerville or Point South, they're going to have to go right

479
00:49:49,168 --> 00:50:08,947
to Mystic Ave North and the first available option is Hancock Court on the left the next available option is Reardon Road on the right to be able to kind of do a big jug handle and circle back to the south and then the the way that directions bring you because those two streets are private ways and they don't typically offer those the directions will

480
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:18,177
direct people all the way up to Main Street where the police station is to take a right onto 16 and do a jug handle back to Mystic Ave.

481
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:28,789
So that's the complication with that restriction really adds a lot of vehicle unnecessary vehicle miles and and puts people into an area that

482
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:33,032
at near the fire police station which is already a heavily traveled area.

483
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:38,435
So same thing with coming southbound if you can't take a left in and people are going to obey that legally.

484
00:50:39,395 --> 00:50:46,800
They might tend to come down from the north heading south on Mystic Ave and take a right on Hancock Court

485
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:54,367
to hit Hancock Ave and Hancock Street to kind of circle around and come out Hancock and go into the proper way.

486
00:50:55,108 --> 00:51:00,313
So it really kind of changes the dynamics of the whole entry and exit to this site.

487
00:51:01,054 --> 00:51:08,841
And it doesn't appear that in the information provided, it doesn't appear that the project

488
00:51:09,853 --> 00:51:14,416
made an attempt at adjusting any of the traffic site to explain what the impacts may be.

489
00:51:15,157 --> 00:51:17,518
So I'm trying to highlight what I think they could be.

490
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:25,343
I think Hancock Court and Hancock Ave could see impacts from this restriction and possibly Redmond Road.

491
00:51:25,864 --> 00:51:31,488
And if not either of those, the main street quarter up near main itself.

492
00:51:32,168 --> 00:51:34,751
would see additional traffic that initially need to.

493
00:51:35,412 --> 00:51:46,924
One potential way to alleviate some of this would be if there was a back exit out from the back of the property onto 16, but that would require an access permit request to MassDOT.

494
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:50,127
But that would enable people right in, right out.

495
00:51:50,868 --> 00:51:56,929
to turn right to southbound when they're exiting and come from the north turning right in.

496
00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:19,773
So that would help alleviate, but I couldn't speak to whether the likelihood of that permit or not, but that's one way to potentially kind of address the ability for people visiting the site to travel to the south when they exit or come here from the north a little more directly.

497
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:43,219
Speaking with Danielle earlier, one of the concerns that I had with that actual option would be that the back of Mystic Valley Parkway or Route 16, the way it merges with that exit on I-93, that would be putting a lot of traffic, spilling a lot of traffic out at that traffic light coming on to Mystic, before you get to Mystic.

498
00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:46,481
It's just the way Mystic Valley Parkway is set up, period.

499
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:49,288
100% correct, yeah, 100% correct.

500
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:55,930
It would introduce traffic to an already congested area that the DOT and us are already concerned about.

501
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:07,573
But even without that driveway in the back, that's the way the directions is going to get someone north of Mystic Ave, turn right around the police station and come back south all the way down to that signal anyways.

502
00:53:08,713 --> 00:53:16,536
So either that or they'll circle left to Hancock Ave or left onto Main Street and come down Main Street through South Medford.

503
00:53:16,896 --> 00:53:27,499
So those are kind of the two options if you do it like a wider aerial view or like a 2,000-foot aerial view, kind of see the options.

504
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:31,020
So yeah, if you

505
00:53:32,305 --> 00:53:48,003
If you go north up, so you could turn left onto Hancock Court, which is a private street, and then another left onto Hancock Ave, then a left onto Hancock Street would bring you back to where you would have been if you took a left out of the site.

506
00:53:50,667 --> 00:54:04,116
And if you go all the way up and take a right on Reardon Road, which is essentially, it's a private drive south of James Street, that would take you out to the backside of Mystic Valley Parkway, or if you go up to the police station, same thing.

507
00:54:05,157 --> 00:54:10,400
So it's really hampering the ability of people to exit if it doesn't sell.

508
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:17,005
And I think the traffic study mentioned that they thought 60% of the traffic was coming from the south, to and from the south.

509
00:54:20,442 --> 00:54:26,148
And it's not the projects, you know, the project didn't propose this.

510
00:54:26,448 --> 00:54:32,514
It was required of them, but we're just trying to talk about what the impacts may be to the community after the fact.

511
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:36,978
Understood.

512
00:54:37,459 --> 00:54:38,540
Thank you, Director Blake.

513
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:40,482
Director Hunt?

514
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:57,424
just wanted to add that I don't, I think that it, I've been looking at these exits to the Mystic Valley Parkway in the back, and I think that it might be worth for some of the businesses to pursue it in general, but I don't think it's a short-term solution.

515
00:54:57,444 --> 00:55:01,367
I don't think anybody's going to get a yes from DOT in months.

516
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,550
It probably would take years, so I wouldn't actually try to

517
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:11,551
even condition anything on on it because of the likely the lack of likelihood of it.

518
00:55:12,992 --> 00:55:16,972
But I would like to like I do think it's a reasonable issue.

519
00:55:17,492 --> 00:55:30,835
And I actually I had thought when I was thinking about it before that there was another one of the streets came back through onto Mystic Valley Parkway before route 16 but you're right we're after that that part where the street where you can cut back onto it.

520
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:47,434
So I just wanted to say that that we would it from the planning office, support them and help them but I don't think that it's it's it's not worth burdening a project that that was something that is so impossible.

521
00:55:49,676 --> 00:55:55,661
And that it's not their fault that this was being pushed on them partway through construction, so.

522
00:55:59,998 --> 00:56:01,744
Yeah, no, I appreciate that.

523
00:56:03,748 --> 00:56:06,370
And I don't wanna speak against the state because they're there for a reason.

524
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:15,215
Me working for a state, a fellow state agency myself, I definitely understand, but I will tell you that economically, it could kill a project.

525
00:56:15,795 --> 00:56:24,860
And unless the city is looking at a feasibility of a traffic study for the entire strip where others can actually come in and pay for the impacts.

526
00:56:25,101 --> 00:56:32,445
And just, I can't even imagine what an access permit, not adding costs, but at the same time, adding time to this project.

527
00:56:33,317 --> 00:56:35,759
I've just taken that into consideration.

528
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:52,392
It could, in the future, be like a, I'm not sure how the proponent feels about that anyways, but just in my experience, I know that it could be cumbersome.

529
00:56:53,192 --> 00:56:53,613
Danielle?

530
00:56:55,714 --> 00:56:56,054
Thank you.

531
00:56:56,114 --> 00:56:56,315
Yeah.

532
00:56:58,018 --> 00:57:15,512
We definitely don't want to condition that they attain an access permit, but I think as the property owner, I think it has to come from them if they, like an application would have to come from them because it would be an access off of their private property.

533
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:26,361
So I don't think the city can play on their behalf, but I think we, I think they ought to seek it and we could support it.

534
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:56,855
I don't know the details that go into it, so I would defer to Director Blake, because I do think it would behoove us to try to mitigate the impacts of not being able to travel south from the site to keep cars from speeding through, especially the Hancock Court area is one I'm concerned about.

535
00:57:57,904 --> 00:58:02,627
folks taking a ride out and immediately, you know, banging a left into there and then like flying through.

536
00:58:03,808 --> 00:58:11,554
Hancock Court is a private way, so I don't think that we can do things unilaterally.

537
00:58:11,574 --> 00:58:13,755
There would have to be an agreement with those property owners.

538
00:58:13,775 --> 00:58:20,600
Let's say we wanted to put like speed hump in or, you know, ask for the applicant to put a speed hump in there to mitigate that.

539
00:58:23,442 --> 00:58:25,804
I see Director Blake has his hand raised.

540
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:50,748
Yeah, so just to go along with what Danielle was saying, yeah, there are ways to potentially mitigate negative impacts to Hancock Court or Redden Road or any of those two private ways, some of which could be a speed hump or something like that, or restricting access in the form of making those write-in, write-outs, whether it's with FlexPost or Median or something like that.

541
00:58:51,148 --> 00:58:55,711
But again, because they're private ways, it would be subject to the private ways agreeing to those things.

542
00:58:56,921 --> 00:59:00,423
It could be determined at a later date or a certain value or something like that.

543
00:59:00,543 --> 00:59:09,328
But those do seem like the most immediate options for people to exit or enter from the way that's restricted from the driveway.

544
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:20,154
I want to point out that the MassDOT approval also included re-timing of the traffic signal at Harvard Street and Mystic Avenue, Route 16, which is the one we were saying is congested.

545
00:59:21,255 --> 00:59:33,878
Obviously, by MassDOT requiring them to retime that, they already think that that signal system needs work, and the state and the city have already discussed those in the past, unrelated to projects, how it needs some work down there.

546
00:59:34,258 --> 00:59:50,862
But either way, this project would send traffic through at least that portion of that signal, because either they're traveling down Mystic Ave if the restriction wasn't in place, and they'd go through that signal, or they'd go Mystic Valley Parkway on the backside and still end up going through that signal.

547
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:55,923
But with an off-ramp and 16-meter is definitely problematic.

548
00:59:56,604 --> 01:00:08,587
So it would be nice to try to mitigate, try to come up with some way to mitigate the negative impacts to say Hancock Court and Hancock Ave.

549
01:00:09,738 --> 01:00:11,920
and possibly Redden Road too.

550
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:21,046
But if we did so and those were successful, then the option leaving would go all the way back up to the police station area.

551
01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:25,049
So it's just a challenging situation that we're all put in right now with this.

552
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:31,314
But we wanted to make it work and be successful, right, without being an impact.

553
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:41,367
If I may, I mean, I don't mind applying for access out the back, but I just don't want it to take it as a condition to hold me up on my CEO.

554
01:00:41,507 --> 01:00:47,170
Like we're, I'd say, I don't know, 70, 75% of the project right now are set to open in July.

555
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:50,072
But that was something I will do.

556
01:00:50,993 --> 01:00:56,176
It's just, after going through the MassDOT process, it's timely.

557
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:01,410
No, I missed his author.

558
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:05,552
I, I, myself as just one board member, I wouldn't be comfortable conditioning that.

559
01:01:05,632 --> 01:01:06,492
Thank you.

560
01:01:11,415 --> 01:01:13,716
Are there any comments or concerns from the board?

561
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:18,178
Uh, yes.

562
01:01:18,398 --> 01:01:27,902
I just wanted to, uh, kind of summarize the situation and just kind of give kind of what I saw as the,

563
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:40,315
the kind of short and long-term, I think it's still worth it in the long-term to pursue the access permit on Route 16.

564
01:01:41,055 --> 01:01:53,099
But I don't think that's, like we said, something to condition the whole project on at this moment, as Mr. Zarathyr pointed out, they're almost done with the project.

565
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:56,060
So I do think in the

566
01:01:58,513 --> 01:02:16,566
Short term, some kind of attempt to seek to do traffic calming on the side streets where traffic would be diverted is probably the best available mitigation in the short term.

567
01:02:17,146 --> 01:02:27,233
And I would want to ask Director Blake or Director Hunt what the process would be like, because those are private ways, to get something in there.

568
01:02:34,235 --> 01:02:35,101
It's a very good question.

569
01:02:37,245 --> 01:02:43,948
There might be a way on public streets to address the Hancock issue, but it wouldn't necessarily be on Hancock Court itself.

570
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:51,372
You could potentially put traffic calming in Hancock Ave, which Hancock Court, once you go down there, leads to Hancock Ave in both directions.

571
01:02:52,053 --> 01:02:56,615
So you could put a traffic calming device on a public street in either direction on Hancock Ave, potentially.

572
01:02:56,975 --> 01:02:58,796
That would be within the city's control.

573
01:03:00,137 --> 01:03:05,439
The private way I think it would handle it, if there was a recommendation that was associated with this project,

574
01:03:06,942 --> 01:03:19,613
you know, this evening or some other time, you could condition something in the form of some traffic calming element, this, this, or this, subject to the approval of the rightful owners of the private way.

575
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:25,718
Almost like a lot of times we suggest traffic calming on state roads, but we say subject to mass DOT.

576
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:29,742
So it's subject to whoever has rights to make that decision on that road.

577
01:03:31,782 --> 01:03:34,084
Yeah, it'll be kind of blazing a little new trail.

578
01:03:34,124 --> 01:03:45,133
But the easiest way that I've been thinking of handling this would be, in terms of time, I am cognizant of the whole discussion about the time of the project and delays.

579
01:03:46,754 --> 01:03:51,758
In my experience, professional experience, being on the private or public side of previous developments,

580
01:03:53,622 --> 01:04:12,388
even though sometimes it's not preferred, sometimes it is preferred, money doesn't take any time offering money for a solution, like putting it set aside for that purpose to be determined at a later date, then you're not tied to, you know, a specific thing that has to be done before you open type thing.

581
01:04:13,909 --> 01:04:20,751
So that's one way, you know, but you could prescribe like speed humps at this location, public street or private street subject to approval.

582
01:04:21,705 --> 01:04:33,015
or median or term restriction at those, subject to their approval, or money in lieu of those types of improvements, some value.

583
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:37,078
But yeah, that's the way I'd go about doing it.

584
01:04:37,298 --> 01:04:47,147
I mean, again, if we're successful and we deter people from using those options, then the option that's left is all the way up to Maine at the police station.

585
01:04:52,445 --> 01:05:01,448
There may be some that choose to illegally disobey those term restrictions, and those would be subject to the enforcement of the state police because it's on the state portion of Mystic Ave.

586
01:05:02,748 --> 01:05:06,109
We wouldn't advise that because if there's an incident, you'd be at fault.

587
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:13,391
But yeah, these are kind of the limited options it seems like we have at this point.

588
01:05:13,711 --> 01:05:20,233
I mean, if we had more time, what I'd normally suggest is for the traffic engineer for the project to

589
01:05:21,783 --> 01:05:29,566
study this and recommend something, you know, study what they believe the impacts are based on their trip distribution and what their recommendations would be.

590
01:05:29,586 --> 01:05:32,507
But, you know, in the interest of time, we're trying to shortcut that process.

591
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:39,970
Thank you, Dr. Blake.

592
01:05:44,632 --> 01:05:57,543
Actually, if I can add, it's worth it to say that in the past, in the original submission, usually any development, even this one, comes and discusses the scope of a traffic study.

593
01:05:57,943 --> 01:06:01,707
And I had suggested more locations of a scope for this project.

594
01:06:02,327 --> 01:06:05,910
and the project chose to just study this one intersection closest by.

595
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:17,200
So that also impacts the ability to then go back and redistribute the traffic because the redistributed traffic wouldn't even go through the one study area intersection.

596
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:24,927
So if it had included other intersections, you might be able to reuse some of the data and then readjust the trip assignments.

597
01:06:35,557 --> 01:06:40,322
Before I open it up to the public for comment, are there any other questions from the board?

598
01:06:40,342 --> 01:06:53,834
I do see that we just had a couple of people, I'm not sure if there's public, so I'm going to open it up at this point.

599
01:06:55,753 --> 01:07:00,255
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

600
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:04,157
You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.org.

601
01:07:04,597 --> 01:07:07,639
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

602
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:14,603
A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

603
01:07:15,123 --> 01:07:21,747
However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be intervened through the chat to alert myself and staff.

604
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:30,453
Daniel, can you please manage the comment queue and read any previous letters or emails that you've received prior to this meeting?

605
01:07:32,954 --> 01:07:41,558
Madam Chair, I do not see any members of the public who raised hands and I have not received any common letters.

606
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:50,962
Awesome, then I can close the public comment queue

607
01:07:53,092 --> 01:07:57,155
for this meeting or the public comment period for this meeting.

608
01:07:58,675 --> 01:07:59,916
And I'll go back to the board.

609
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,418
For the city, can you actually provide us with the original?

610
01:08:03,478 --> 01:08:07,721
I know that there's some conditions that are no longer relevant with these changes.

611
01:08:08,582 --> 01:08:13,365
Can you remind us of what still stands?

612
01:08:15,986 --> 01:08:21,069
Yes, so the control plans will be amended.

613
01:08:23,477 --> 01:08:30,959
The other conditions that were in there, there was ones that are still relevant.

614
01:08:31,499 --> 01:08:41,862
I have not checked the landscaping plans to see if those plants are considered drought tolerant.

615
01:08:42,562 --> 01:08:48,604
But there's a condition to prioritize native species and plants with lower water needs.

616
01:08:52,812 --> 01:08:57,255
and I don't have a green thumb, I couldn't tell you if these comply with that.

617
01:08:57,516 --> 01:08:58,797
So I would keep that condition.

618
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:11,986
The conditions for the wayfinding signage would be modified.

619
01:09:14,716 --> 01:09:20,461
It's one of the conditions is, and I could share my screen at this point to go over these.

620
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:21,742
Let's see.

621
01:09:22,843 --> 01:09:23,984
That'll just make it easier.

622
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:25,125
Let's see here.

623
01:09:25,485 --> 01:09:31,610
Let's make sure.

624
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:39,937
So do you guys see?

625
01:09:40,838 --> 01:09:43,060
This is the amended decision.

626
01:09:45,574 --> 01:09:58,037
So the beginning is the control plans and then on this one, so to be that, that would still keep that.

627
01:09:58,057 --> 01:10:06,619
So number seven was applicant to furnish and install wayfinding signage and parking aisle markings enforcing one way circulation through northern parking lot.

628
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,621
We would want to revise that currently

629
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:27,463
There's a sign that says keep right, but I think it may benefit from having a do not enter sign there as well, so that when folks are entering, they don't shoot straight and then collide with the car.

630
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:34,986
So in addition to the keep right, I think we should kind of augment the wayfinding with a do not enter.

631
01:10:37,788 --> 01:10:42,470
And also the stop line in the front parking lot for Todd's comments.

632
01:10:45,424 --> 01:10:50,610
Number eight is no longer relevant, as they did submit that plan.

633
01:10:52,132 --> 01:11:03,884
If we wanted to have a condition, requesting them to apply for an access permit to route 16, but not tied to must do like must receive it or anything like that.

634
01:11:07,269 --> 01:11:19,432
to go ahead and apply for it and see what happens, but because we can't apply for it, it'd be great if they would do that, but not tied to any approvals.

635
01:11:21,992 --> 01:11:36,416
And then with Director Blake's original conditions for mitigation, as he noted, the state required the

636
01:11:38,915 --> 01:11:43,258
What have they called the RFBs?

637
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:50,062
Yeah, in my original recommendations, I think it was 1B and RFB.

638
01:11:50,582 --> 01:11:54,624
I don't think that made it into the city's prior approval, but MassDOT then required it anyways.

639
01:11:54,784 --> 01:12:01,308
So yeah, traffic comments 1A and 1B were satisfied by the MassDOT plans.

640
01:12:03,009 --> 01:12:07,151
And then so the remaining condition would be,

641
01:12:10,203 --> 01:12:21,874
Mitigation item I, which this, it is not referenced in this, but I can call up that one.

642
01:12:21,894 --> 01:12:25,897
Yeah, Danielle, I could help while you're doing that.

643
01:12:26,778 --> 01:12:34,805
So the condition was written in such a way before that if some of the recommendations I had weren't

644
01:12:37,523 --> 01:12:41,366
weren't approved by Mass, then they'd be substituted with another condition.

645
01:12:41,927 --> 01:12:48,712
So one C, which was like a painted bump out essentially on Mystic Ave, Mass that didn't agree with that.

646
01:12:48,752 --> 01:13:03,704
So then it would revert to I, which was a, I was a comment condition to traffic calm the side streets in the Pearl Street, Stern Street, Frederick Street area for any vehicles traveling to and from the West.

647
01:13:05,205 --> 01:13:10,869
of the project, like say Tufts University area, via one of those side streets to Hancock Street.

648
01:13:10,889 --> 01:13:16,053
So that was condition I.

649
01:13:30,045 --> 01:13:34,227
Danielle, did you provide us with these conditions?

650
01:13:34,247 --> 01:13:35,287
That's what I'm looking for.

651
01:13:38,148 --> 01:13:39,569
So it's in the previous decision.

652
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:52,514
So can you see the memo that's up here now?

653
01:13:53,815 --> 01:13:54,095
Yes.

654
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:58,057
Yeah, so these are the conditions.

655
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:10,123
this is before I started writing the conditions where most of them were like, the conditions were referenced, would reference memos, and now I'm trying to call them out completely.

656
01:14:10,203 --> 01:14:12,564
So that's why there's a lot of back and forth here.

657
01:14:12,584 --> 01:14:17,166
This is during the handoff time where I wasn't staffing this board yet.

658
01:14:17,966 --> 01:14:22,208
So this is the if then kind of conditions that Director Blake had had.

659
01:14:24,358 --> 01:14:39,965
So the one that is still relevant would be this condition, little I, about mitigation of some of the side streets that is under the city's purview.

660
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:44,194
but the solar powered radar feedback, they did that.

661
01:14:44,835 --> 01:14:49,237
The state required it, so that doesn't need to be called out as condition because it's on the plans.

662
01:14:49,597 --> 01:14:54,159
Sorry, Danielle, that double I, that one was satisfied by a different project on this.

663
01:14:54,299 --> 01:14:56,620
Oh, a different project, you're right, you're right, you're right.

664
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:05,184
We're still doing that though, don't we meet all the conditions with the mass DOT, what we're doing there, so we didn't have to do the side streets?

665
01:15:06,492 --> 01:15:09,535
Yes, if Danielle could scroll back up to the top.

666
01:15:09,555 --> 01:15:19,685
So what happened in the previous decision, if I may, Danielle, is this was the recommended conditions that I submitted, but the decision did not include this full list.

667
01:15:19,705 --> 01:15:21,586
It included some of the list.

668
01:15:21,867 --> 01:15:25,910
So we were trying to go down which ones were included and which ones weren't.

669
01:15:26,131 --> 01:15:27,972
So if you go all the way up to the top,

670
01:15:31,347 --> 01:15:35,669
1A is dropping the traveling, which the MassDOT plan does.

671
01:15:35,689 --> 01:15:41,591
And that 1A was, correct me if I'm wrong, Danielle, that 1A was incorporated into the previous decision.

672
01:15:41,932 --> 01:15:44,593
So it was a condition, but MassDOT plan does satisfy that.

673
01:15:44,653 --> 01:15:47,554
So 1A is gone with the MassDOT plan.

674
01:15:47,754 --> 01:15:55,317
1B was a recommendation I had made, but the decision did not include it, but MassDOT ended up including it on their own.

675
01:15:56,197 --> 01:15:57,898
So 1B is satisfied.

676
01:15:59,225 --> 01:16:07,251
One C was included, I think, in the conditions of the previous approval, but MASDA did not agree to that.

677
01:16:07,651 --> 01:16:13,435
So then that's what kicked the one down to the alternate.

678
01:16:13,455 --> 01:16:15,056
Because one C, MASDA didn't agree.

679
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:18,718
It went to a different condition because they didn't.

680
01:16:18,758 --> 01:16:23,281
We're doing the solar light, number two on the list.

681
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:26,023
If you go down, we're doing that.

682
01:16:27,204 --> 01:16:28,325
It wasn't all the conditions.

683
01:16:31,275 --> 01:16:40,461
So number two, I don't think that was incorporated into the previous D or number two, I don't think was incorporated into the conditions of the previous.

684
01:16:41,421 --> 01:16:55,590
And then so I was, if for some reason the project was unable to fill one A, B or C or D, so D wasn't incorporated in the decision, but C was, and they weren't able to fill it, so then it kicked into this I.

685
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:59,451
Well, what about what's going to, if we go to two on the list, we're doing that.

686
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:05,192
So I feel like we're, we're, we're going above and beyond and I shouldn't be part of this.

687
01:17:11,554 --> 01:17:17,535
The one B above with the RFPs that wasn't part of the planning board's decision.

688
01:17:17,555 --> 01:17:18,515
It was part of my recreation.

689
01:17:18,575 --> 01:17:23,036
It wasn't part of the planning board decision and mass dot ended up incorporating that.

690
01:17:23,536 --> 01:17:23,716
Yeah.

691
01:17:23,856 --> 01:17:26,217
So I guess my ask is to not do one because we're doing two.

692
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:48,227
So this is the, Alicia, do you, so we have a conditions compliance tracking spreadsheet.

693
01:17:48,988 --> 01:17:54,690
I did not create this document, but it has three conditions.

694
01:17:58,212 --> 01:18:02,354
So one was to submit a plan to restructure the merging of the two northbound lanes.

695
01:18:03,815 --> 01:18:09,978
And so that's moot now because of the DOT plans.

696
01:18:10,258 --> 01:18:18,983
And then the one C was provide enhancements to the new science markings layout from part A if the land structure is revised.

697
01:18:19,972 --> 01:18:22,033
Yeah, this was, it's kind of confusing.

698
01:18:22,533 --> 01:18:32,698
But then- One C was essentially a painted bump out to shield the crosswalk on Mystic Ave, but they didn't agree to doing the delineators because VASTA doesn't like maintaining those.

699
01:18:33,318 --> 01:18:34,938
And so, yeah, so DOT didn't agree to that.

700
01:18:34,999 --> 01:18:49,705
And then the third condition that was in the decision basically said if DOT doesn't... So the one about...

701
01:18:51,298 --> 01:19:01,707
the side streets off main street, that was a condition to be sued in the event that conditions 1A and 1C are not approved by MassDOT.

702
01:19:03,969 --> 01:19:13,457
And it sounds like MassDOT- Yeah, if you look at the condition below, it's the solar paneled traffic, which we are doing, so.

703
01:19:15,019 --> 01:19:16,280
I thought that was the crosswalk.

704
01:19:17,032 --> 01:19:26,097
So yeah, MassDOT added in, they agreed with one of my recommended conditions that wasn't part of the official planning board approval.

705
01:19:26,397 --> 01:19:27,858
So it was basically an add-on.

706
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:40,665
The RFB 1B, the RRFB, the planning board didn't include that in their decision, but MassDOT chose to add it.

707
01:19:41,466 --> 01:19:43,767
That is correct, but the way that,

708
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:51,696
previous approval was written when C was part of the board's decision and that wasn't approved by MASDA so that kicked in the eye.

709
01:19:57,374 --> 01:20:01,655
I was going to add, I realize that this is actually quite complicated at this point.

710
01:20:02,155 --> 01:20:14,038
And I think my recommendation would be that the board think about, worry less about what were the previous conditions and more about what is the right thing to do here.

711
01:20:14,618 --> 01:20:19,119
What are the things that are necessary to make this project safe, like we would be doing?

712
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:20,840
What are the applicant

713
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:25,501
What is the applicant doing and already doing whether we're requiring it or MassDOT?

714
01:20:26,422 --> 01:20:32,263
Because all along this has been a project where cost has been a major issue and MassDOT is requiring a bunch of him.

715
01:20:32,763 --> 01:20:37,825
So let's just make sure that what we're putting forward makes sense.

716
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:54,741
And I honestly, I'm more concerned that what we're putting forward makes sense than whether we're including every single condition that was previously considered, particularly where MassDOT got in the middle of this and messed with our requirements.

717
01:20:55,661 --> 01:20:59,163
And I will note that member Fishman has their hand up.

718
01:20:59,743 --> 01:21:07,426
Yes, and before Ari goes, one of the things I wanted to note, Director Hunt, is that I haven't been properly prepped on this one.

719
01:21:07,466 --> 01:21:13,188
I'm not sure about the rest of the board to know even how to discuss conditions going forward, is what I meant.

720
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:19,310
I don't know what the department heads, I don't remember, recall what the department heads' suggestions are going forward.

721
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:20,651
So that's the problem I'm having.

722
01:21:20,951 --> 01:21:22,131
So that's what I was trying to see.

723
01:21:22,191 --> 01:21:26,353
Honestly, I didn't realize that there would be any need to change any conditions.

724
01:21:26,973 --> 01:21:31,916
I looked at this as this is a new site plan that we were approving the new site plan.

725
01:21:33,117 --> 01:21:36,139
I didn't think that it was going to trigger any additional conditions.

726
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:42,703
So it didn't occur to me that you would want to review the conditions and change them at this time.

727
01:21:44,472 --> 01:21:45,812
especially this late in the game.

728
01:21:45,892 --> 01:22:02,958
I mean, honestly, to put in conditions on a project that hasn't gotten its building permit and hasn't started construction is something to, I wouldn't feel that it's fair to add any conditions to a project so far into construction as this is.

729
01:22:03,338 --> 01:22:10,980
I mean, if it's like, oh, well, that tree can't go there, so now we have to move it over here, but that's still, it's all site plan.

730
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,421
You know, it's moving some things around.

731
01:22:14,658 --> 01:22:21,301
The beauty of what you have just said would have been relevant in a PDS memo prior to this meeting, and we could have been prepared.

732
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:26,964
I understand that, but we don't have that kind of freedom of time.

733
01:22:27,744 --> 01:22:29,185
No, and I definitely understand that.

734
01:22:29,225 --> 01:22:35,267
But when you said fair, it would have helped to be more fair of everyone's time across the board.

735
01:22:36,168 --> 01:22:36,768
Ari Fishman.

736
01:22:41,104 --> 01:23:02,661
I suppose this, while I had this thought before, Director Hunt's suggestion that we move away from that discussion, it is kind of slightly adjacent, which is I've been thinking about the discussions about right turns and left turns and the rather convoluted routes that people will have to take.

737
01:23:03,997 --> 01:23:14,129
And I'm thinking of it in light of the fact that alcohol impairs judgment, even within legal driving limits.

738
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:23,220
And I do have some concerns for the neighborhood neighbors and traffic patterns with convoluted paths that

739
01:23:23,794 --> 01:23:33,882
If this is hopefully a successful project, people will be coming from beyond the immediate neighborhood, people unfamiliar with the local small streets and potentially with judgment impaired.

740
01:23:34,463 --> 01:23:37,125
I have some traffic safety concerns.

741
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:40,267
I don't know what the solution is, but I did want to explicitly name it.

742
01:23:40,287 --> 01:23:46,232
Director Boyd?

743
01:23:47,538 --> 01:23:51,985
Yeah, I just wanted to state, for the record, I wasn't adding conditions.

744
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:59,275
Danielle and I were going through what conditions were still relevant or not after the mass stock changes.

745
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:11,273
The ads would be the right of the access permit request.

746
01:24:11,293 --> 01:24:15,255
That's an ad in the back, which I didn't necessarily suggest.

747
01:24:16,475 --> 01:24:27,821
And the traffic column that we discussed earlier for Hancock, CORT or AV, which we didn't get to the point of talking about the misconditions yet, just the conversation.

748
01:24:27,841 --> 01:24:31,763
Thank you.

749
01:24:31,923 --> 01:24:32,563
Peter Cowles?

750
01:24:36,955 --> 01:24:57,469
First, I'm going to echo Chair McPherson's concerns about the preparedness of this board, given really the level of sophistication of some of these traffic issues.

751
01:24:58,269 --> 01:25:03,733
I mean, I do understand the lack of capacity

752
01:25:05,085 --> 01:25:30,530
the of pds staff to deal with it but i do want to express uh concern about trying to put all this through immediately uh i mean understanding uh the applicants very legitimate concerns that this is a project that is going to open in the next few months and we need to he needs us to make make some decisions and then

753
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:57,372
Also, doing my job as clerk, I've put to, I just wanted to kind of give a state of play on what we're considering, not taking into account the relevance or irrelevance of any particular conditions of the previous approval, but things we have discussed based on the new layout tonight, and that would be the additional

754
01:25:59,345 --> 01:26:09,727
Signage and pavement markings, the stop signs, and the do not enter signs within the parking, the revised parking area as directed, as specified by city staff.

755
01:26:11,787 --> 01:26:28,090
The application for an access permit on Route 16 not tied to any, not tied to any kind of, not tied to anything of the project opening, just they have to do it.

756
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:43,433
at some point, and the working with the city to apply some sort of traffic calming on Hancock Ave, I believe, is the public way.

757
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:47,594
And that's what I have written down.

758
01:26:48,975 --> 01:26:49,295
Thank you.

759
01:26:51,776 --> 01:26:52,536
Thank you, Piotr.

760
01:26:52,576 --> 01:26:53,036
Danielle?

761
01:26:57,678 --> 01:27:04,682
I just want to state that I also agree that you're probably not as prepared as you would like to be.

762
01:27:04,702 --> 01:27:11,205
I didn't get the memo and some of the plans until Monday and escaping plan today.

763
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:15,228
So there wasn't actually time to do any of those things and.

764
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:18,917
The other plans came in Friday after our close of business.

765
01:27:19,537 --> 01:27:22,318
So I actually was doing stuff over the weekend for this.

766
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:27,399
So I do try to make sure you guys are prepared.

767
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:37,702
But you could take another meeting to find out the conditions.

768
01:27:37,882 --> 01:27:39,303
June 5 would be the next one.

769
01:27:43,009 --> 01:28:08,324
I don't, everything can be happening concurrently, I believe, but I, I defer to Director Hunt, and I noticed that our economic development director may be listening in, not sure if he's available, but all the other city department reviews that are happening at the same time, and we're trying to try to

770
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:16,694
organize this so that the project can be successful, but there are things that need to be addressed.

771
01:28:16,754 --> 01:28:20,436
And it's unfortunate that MassDOT really threw in a monkey wrench here.

772
01:28:23,084 --> 01:28:24,125
Thank you, Danielle.

773
01:28:24,165 --> 01:28:25,305
I really appreciate it.

774
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:32,229
And trust me, I definitely, I sympathize and I empathize with the lack of capacity on your end.

775
01:28:32,449 --> 01:28:40,713
And I'm not placing fault at this point at all, but at the same time, the owner should not be on the board to try to speed through something that we're not able to understand.

776
01:28:41,173 --> 01:28:43,855
And we understand that it's also not the applicant's fault.

777
01:28:43,895 --> 01:28:45,295
There's no fault being placed here.

778
01:28:45,315 --> 01:28:46,716
I'm not even gonna blame MASCA.

779
01:28:47,096 --> 01:28:48,357
They're doing their due diligence, right?

780
01:28:48,717 --> 01:28:50,238
It's one of those things where I just,

781
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:59,021
It's so complex, there's layers to this, and I'm just trying to better understand so that I can lead the board in making a decision forward.

782
01:28:59,121 --> 01:29:06,304
And I understand it's not fair to anyone across the board, whether it's the city, the applicant, or the board, in trying to rush this forward.

783
01:29:07,004 --> 01:29:10,546
I just need to know the best path forward.

784
01:29:14,647 --> 01:29:16,868
I'd prefer to stay here all night if we could.

785
01:29:16,908 --> 01:29:18,749
I don't want to have to stop the project tomorrow.

786
01:29:24,511 --> 01:29:25,912
Sal DiStefano?

787
01:29:28,454 --> 01:29:29,935
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

788
01:29:30,536 --> 01:29:36,240
Sal DiStefano, Director of Economic Development.

789
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,442
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.

790
01:29:39,383 --> 01:29:40,944
I just wanted to say that

791
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:54,865
definitely understand your concerns, Madam Chair and members of the board, and just wanted to say that from our office,

792
01:29:58,718 --> 01:30:04,423
We think that the end result of this project will be very good for the city.

793
01:30:05,364 --> 01:30:17,554
And we are working with, I am working with every single department head that's touching this project to work through any outstanding issues that we have.

794
01:30:17,695 --> 01:30:25,041
So we're putting a lot of effort into this to support Brian and everything he's working on.

795
01:30:26,462 --> 01:30:36,391
and in the end result you know this the everybody working together I think will result in a very good project.

796
01:30:37,212 --> 01:30:38,774
I do want to point out that

797
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:52,271
This is a big project, more complicated than ones that we may be used to on the economic development side.

798
01:30:52,331 --> 01:30:59,492
However, I think it could be served as a template for other businesses that wanna come to the city.

799
01:31:00,753 --> 01:31:09,855
And just wanna say that I'm willing to work with all of you to try to see if we can smooth over any issues.

800
01:31:11,175 --> 01:31:17,157
and just want to be helpful to everybody that's involved here.

801
01:31:17,417 --> 01:31:20,718
And I thank you for your time and consideration.

802
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:22,839
Thank you.

803
01:31:24,459 --> 01:31:28,320
Peter Cowles.

804
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:29,741
Thank you, Madam Chair.

805
01:31:29,761 --> 01:31:38,444
There's something that Mr. Zarthur touched on that I think is important to note, and I'm not sure if that was

806
01:31:39,903 --> 01:31:48,449
I mean, I don't know if anyone in the in the city can confirm this is saying that he didn't want to have to shut down the project tomorrow.

807
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:59,157
And I don't think any of our conditions, should we add them would significantly impede the completion of the project.

808
01:31:59,177 --> 01:31:59,758
I mean, I don't think.

809
01:32:00,609 --> 01:32:06,511
I mean, I think out of what I had written down, one of them isn't even on site, and one of them is theoretical.

810
01:32:07,071 --> 01:32:09,932
So I just want to make sure, because I would agree.

811
01:32:09,952 --> 01:32:21,975
I mean, professionally, I know these kind of project timelines, and I don't want to do anything that would force a stop to work this far in.

812
01:32:22,075 --> 01:32:24,876
So that's a consideration as well.

813
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:29,477
Thank you, Director Blake.

814
01:32:32,084 --> 01:32:33,905
Yeah, I just wanted to give some dates for people.

815
01:32:33,925 --> 01:32:39,767
The VAI plans are dated February 24, February 2024.

816
01:32:39,927 --> 01:32:45,190
And so those are the plans submitted with the revised site layout.

817
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:51,132
So that means the project knew about those changes before February when they submitted them.

818
01:32:51,693 --> 01:32:55,494
We didn't have the approval from DOT until April 17th.

819
01:32:55,534 --> 01:32:58,556
As soon as I got approval, I emailed him.

820
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:00,296
I didn't know if that was going to be approved or not.

821
01:33:00,436 --> 01:33:01,537
And I believe you were a part of the

822
01:33:02,263 --> 01:33:13,655
The last phone call with I. So, when I became aware of the new plans, I also thought I submitted this for my building permit.

823
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:17,139
If this is the same layout that the city signed off on my building permit.

824
01:33:17,519 --> 01:33:19,261
Yeah, if I may speak to the board, so.

825
01:33:21,692 --> 01:33:28,333
Some plans were submitted to some entities within the city, but not the planning board staff, to my knowledge.

826
01:33:28,573 --> 01:33:33,855
When I became aware of them, I sent those to the planning staff in March.

827
01:33:35,335 --> 01:33:42,596
And so I'm just alluding that there was some time and there was some, you know, and we're being kind of put in this position now.

828
01:33:43,016 --> 01:33:50,058
We're talking, like for me, in my piece, I'm talking about the traffic, what those restrictions that MassDOT created may impact.

829
01:33:50,758 --> 01:33:54,759
like how safety or access may happen.

830
01:33:54,779 --> 01:33:56,900
It has nothing to do with liking the project or not liking the project.

831
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:00,701
If it's a good project or not, it seems like a great project for the city in terms of use.

832
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:02,562
But my job is traffic, right?

833
01:34:02,802 --> 01:34:06,183
But I didn't have approval from DOT in February.

834
01:34:06,323 --> 01:34:09,184
If I had approval from DOT, I would have submitted that.

835
01:34:09,924 --> 01:34:11,305
I had no approval from DOT.

836
01:34:11,325 --> 01:34:16,026
As soon as I got approval, I submitted it even way before back in September 5th.

837
01:34:16,286 --> 01:34:18,247
Our building permit is based on this design.

838
01:34:19,808 --> 01:34:22,334
Yeah, I'm not, you know, discounting that.

839
01:34:22,354 --> 01:34:24,158
So if you want to, I talked to Owen about it.

840
01:34:24,418 --> 01:34:25,200
I have my guys.

841
01:34:25,641 --> 01:34:28,087
Eagle Brook has been working with Owen this entire project.

842
01:34:28,588 --> 01:34:29,730
We've done everything the right way.

843
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:39,576
No, and many of us said it wasn't the project fault in terms of thank you master in terms of and then I'm just not looking to be held up by this.

844
01:34:39,696 --> 01:34:49,263
In terms of mass dot, putting restrictions on turns, it's not your fault, but that, but that doesn't negate our responsibility to comment on those things.

845
01:34:49,924 --> 01:34:52,966
So I have no control over mass dot.

846
01:34:53,607 --> 01:34:55,248
I had no say in these changes.

847
01:34:55,328 --> 01:34:56,929
I did not want to make any of these changes.

848
01:34:56,989 --> 01:34:59,571
I didn't want to come back here tonight to do this.

849
01:35:00,702 --> 01:35:03,463
I was fine with the acceptance from last year.

850
01:35:04,064 --> 01:35:05,925
I have no control over MassDOT.

851
01:35:12,988 --> 01:35:14,489
Thank you so much, Director Blake.

852
01:35:14,749 --> 01:35:15,370
Peter Cowles?

853
01:35:21,873 --> 01:35:27,836
I don't know what I was going to say.

854
01:35:30,861 --> 01:35:37,883
This is a difficult situation for everyone, and I just... Yeah.

855
01:35:38,684 --> 01:35:38,944
Sorry.

856
01:35:40,384 --> 01:35:52,308
Yeah, it's a very difficult situation, but I want to make it absolutely clear that the board, again, the onus is neither on the board to make a decision without having the proper information going forward, because it wasn't our fault either.

857
01:35:53,168 --> 01:35:57,530
So it's unfortunate, but the onus is not on the board.

858
01:36:03,086 --> 01:36:18,449
However, in saying that, I will ask if the board wants to discuss these additional conditions, if there's something that we can come up with that is agreeable with both the board and the city that can make sense that we can capture to move forward.

859
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:26,890
Danielle?

860
01:36:30,987 --> 01:36:44,417
I mean, I think the only issue that was controversial is any mitigation for the side streets that would be impacted.

861
01:36:44,437 --> 01:36:59,167
I think there was maybe confusion with the original decision about if MassDOT didn't approve the first two things and the third one would come in, which was in the decision.

862
01:37:02,477 --> 01:37:14,821
And it's not big ticket items, just painted bump outs on some of those side streets, not even physical things, maybe flex posts, nothing big at all.

863
01:37:17,162 --> 01:37:27,166
And now with the left turn restriction, maybe something needs to happen, maybe Hancock Court needs to be added to that list.

864
01:37:27,746 --> 01:37:31,187
Because unfortunately, the traffic study

865
01:37:31,666 --> 01:37:40,470
and the original mitigation recommendations were based on a completely different traffic flow.

866
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:45,272
Now with traffic dispersing North and South, and now it's all going North.

867
01:37:46,232 --> 01:37:52,355
So I think that was just, should an extra street be added to the mix?

868
01:37:55,876 --> 01:37:57,097
But it's a private way.

869
01:37:57,137 --> 01:37:59,538
I mean, there could also be just a,

870
01:38:02,179 --> 01:38:09,844
loose condition of making best efforts to work with those property owners.

871
01:38:10,764 --> 01:38:13,266
Unfortunately, the traffic counts didn't include those streets.

872
01:38:13,706 --> 01:38:18,509
So it's gonna be hard to measure the impact post opening.

873
01:38:18,909 --> 01:38:27,655
So we don't have pre opening counts to be able to see how many more cars are going down Hancock Court because we don't have those counts.

874
01:38:28,714 --> 01:38:33,136
though I believe Todd, he had requested a certain range, but we didn't have it.

875
01:38:35,298 --> 01:38:39,420
Everything else, I think, is pretty straightforward.

876
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:40,600
We like the site.

877
01:38:41,761 --> 01:38:42,702
Everyone likes the site.

878
01:38:42,742 --> 01:38:43,522
We think it's fine.

879
01:38:43,602 --> 01:38:44,463
Just a few things.

880
01:38:45,143 --> 01:38:47,104
It's just one thing.

881
01:38:47,144 --> 01:38:49,325
It's not going to shut the project down.

882
01:38:49,385 --> 01:38:54,468
I don't think we need to go there.

883
01:38:55,437 --> 01:39:04,319
So we can condition it to make sure that the applicant is working with the city staff or department heads to move that forward, correct?

884
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,220
To flush that out?

885
01:39:09,941 --> 01:39:14,302
Yeah, we can do that if you want to, you know,

886
01:39:15,068 --> 01:39:23,030
deputize city staff to work this out in a way that is amenable and isn't project killing in any way.

887
01:39:23,751 --> 01:39:25,151
We all want to see this succeed.

888
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:31,393
I'm not sure July is actually going to happen based on what's out there.

889
01:39:31,413 --> 01:39:40,776
So I don't see the emergency in rushing through this but

890
01:39:42,315 --> 01:39:46,878
If you want to come out tomorrow and see it, we're on a July 11th opening, so.

891
01:39:51,741 --> 01:39:52,902
So I guess I'm.

892
01:39:54,963 --> 01:39:55,563
Peter cows.

893
01:39:57,704 --> 01:40:03,908
Yeah, I'm just going to run through the conditions again, because I do think, as Danielle said, this is.

894
01:40:05,089 --> 01:40:11,193
A lot of a lot of talk and a lot of noise for what in the end is not not a lot of

895
01:40:12,982 --> 01:40:15,483
potential conditions.

896
01:40:16,063 --> 01:40:22,726
It's really not a lot at all.

897
01:40:23,046 --> 01:40:35,191
My list of conditions I have right now is to say that the conditions of the approval of May of 2023 shall still apply as relevant.

898
01:40:38,084 --> 01:40:43,966
Additional signage and pavement markings are to be added in the parking area specified by city staff.

899
01:40:44,026 --> 01:40:54,269
This is just in regard to the do not enter signs and the stop signs and stop lines as specified by Director Blake and Director Hunt.

900
01:40:55,389 --> 01:41:06,413
And there is the applicant shall apply for a shell

901
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:13,211
Explore applying for an access permit on Route 16 at the rear of the site.

902
01:41:13,531 --> 01:41:24,933
Kind of my wording to ensure that it has nothing to do with the opening or approval of the project in general, just as something we would like the applicant to explore.

903
01:41:27,253 --> 01:41:35,935
And that the applicant shall work with the city to install traffic calming measures on Hancock Avenue.

904
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:44,367
to minimize the danger of potential cut through traffic.

905
01:41:44,467 --> 01:41:49,570
Hancock Avenue was the one that was a public way, and so the city could work on.

906
01:41:51,571 --> 01:41:58,335
And that's all we were considering at this time, as far as I'm aware.

907
01:41:59,816 --> 01:42:00,656
I'm sorry, Peter.

908
01:42:00,856 --> 01:42:05,379
Did you mention the actual signage, the wayfinding as recommended?

909
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:16,776
Yes, that was, I mean, I could be more specific with the addition of the do not enter and stop signage, but yeah, but that's.

910
01:42:20,759 --> 01:42:21,339
Thank you.

911
01:42:25,021 --> 01:42:25,262
Ari?

912
01:42:26,402 --> 01:42:27,043
Ari Fishman?

913
01:42:28,604 --> 01:42:29,064
Thank you.

914
01:42:29,424 --> 01:42:33,507
I am mostly happy with those conditions, which I think are

915
01:42:34,792 --> 01:42:42,199
entirely reasonable given that we're presented with a new site plan and we're trying to move promptly.

916
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:48,864
My only concern is limiting it only to Hancock Avenue.

917
01:42:49,004 --> 01:42:55,430
I'd love if we had a little bit more flexibility in that language around broader traffic calming,

918
01:42:56,195 --> 01:43:10,327
in the area as we determine what the potential cut through routes will likely be as the entrance and exit routes are more fully fleshed out, since it seems like that is still in a little bit of flux.

919
01:43:12,348 --> 01:43:12,989
Thank you, Ari.

920
01:43:13,069 --> 01:43:20,215
I think that's what I meant by going back to the city staff and make sure that there was a minimal agreement on what was going to happen.

921
01:43:21,035 --> 01:43:22,397
Maybe I left that too broad.

922
01:43:23,605 --> 01:43:34,010
Yeah, if we can make that language broad enough that it's to work with city staff to their satisfaction for that area, rather than just Hancock Ave, I'm happy to delegate that to city staff.

923
01:43:34,030 --> 01:43:36,571
I trust their judgment.

924
01:43:37,772 --> 01:43:43,474
I just want to make sure that as we're looking at new traffic patterns, that we're doing due diligence for our community.

925
01:43:45,375 --> 01:43:45,855
Thank you.

926
01:43:46,416 --> 01:43:46,996
Pena Cowles?

927
01:43:52,211 --> 01:44:18,886
we're kind of rewriting what I put up to be a condition to make the applicant shall work with city staff to address potential cut through traffic as to apply traffic calming measures on streets as to apply traffic calming measures to

928
01:44:22,778 --> 01:44:27,820
to alleviate cut through traffic on streets as determined by city staff?

929
01:44:31,722 --> 01:44:32,282
Works for me.

930
01:44:37,765 --> 01:44:46,668
Mr. Zartha, before we ask for a motion on those additional conditions to approve your amendment, are you okay with those conditions?

931
01:44:47,028 --> 01:44:48,109
Yes, absolutely.

932
01:44:48,309 --> 01:44:50,270
Yeah, I hope to get access out the back.

933
01:44:52,673 --> 01:44:58,858
I actually wanted to do it originally and Victor Schrader actually told me to, you know, have everything go on Mystic App.

934
01:44:58,878 --> 01:45:01,319
So I will absolutely try and get access out the back.

935
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:02,921
I really like that.

936
01:45:05,062 --> 01:45:05,883
Thank you very much.

937
01:45:05,923 --> 01:45:08,925
And again, it's just to explore that the fact that you're even going to try.

938
01:45:08,945 --> 01:45:09,705
Yeah, absolutely.

939
01:45:10,506 --> 01:45:11,086
Yeah.

940
01:45:11,146 --> 01:45:11,647
Yeah.

941
01:45:11,827 --> 01:45:15,710
And I'll keep you updated every step of the way, like I did with DOT.

942
01:45:18,422 --> 01:45:19,382
Thank you very much.

943
01:45:19,402 --> 01:45:24,024
So I'm going to- May I ask a question as well?

944
01:45:25,045 --> 01:45:26,145
This is Ben Minix.

945
01:45:26,325 --> 01:45:26,585
Yes.

946
01:45:27,005 --> 01:45:36,289
If it's possible, could the board or maybe the traffic department, if they feel so inclined, make a recommendation for Brian to submit to DOT for an access permit?

947
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:45,333
Just a letter of recommendation or a request to why the board feels it's a better recommendation for access.

948
01:45:48,766 --> 01:45:57,828
The board in our position, you would use it as a condition, but would that be PDS staff that would make the recommendation for why?

949
01:46:00,509 --> 01:46:05,190
To Madam Chair, to MassDOT to support that application.

950
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:07,391
Yeah, I think that

951
01:46:08,358 --> 01:46:11,719
We have a laundry list of reasons why we want to support that.

952
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:27,085
If they keep doing this, it's going to really mess up redevelopment of Mystic Ave, which is such a key corridor that the state's going to need to invest putting more traffic lights and stuff in there to allow left turns.

953
01:46:27,205 --> 01:46:29,246
Or they can just give access to the rear.

954
01:46:29,866 --> 01:46:31,066
It's an economic development issue.

955
01:46:31,106 --> 01:46:33,887
I think that we could frame this many ways.

956
01:46:35,328 --> 01:46:35,468
Yeah.

957
01:46:36,253 --> 01:46:43,692
So I think what I heard Mr. Minnick say was that you would like it if we made it a condition that the applicant.

958
01:46:45,685 --> 01:46:48,247
request or approach D.O.T.

959
01:46:48,308 --> 01:46:51,370
about it because then you could go to D.O.T.

960
01:46:51,410 --> 01:46:54,633
and saying, look, it was the city who's saying we should do this.

961
01:46:54,653 --> 01:46:56,695
I just want to be clear.

962
01:46:57,776 --> 01:46:58,257
Sorry.

963
01:46:58,337 --> 01:47:02,080
No, I was just, I guess, informally asking and we can we do a letter.

964
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:02,941
Yeah.

965
01:47:03,141 --> 01:47:10,408
And I could we could send you a request informally outside of the meeting just for that request, I guess, outside of a condition.

966
01:47:11,015 --> 01:47:20,044
Yes, so outside of a condition and then yes, our economic development director can work with our traffic staff at putting something together to DOT.

967
01:47:20,064 --> 01:47:21,245
Thank you.

968
01:47:23,127 --> 01:47:28,833
And then I can only imagine that the board's recommendation to explore that would back that up.

969
01:47:29,373 --> 01:47:30,755
I think that's sufficient.

970
01:47:33,378 --> 01:47:42,043
Okay, so I am going to ask the clerk for a motion to approve the amendment to the site plan as he has already recited conditions.

971
01:47:46,846 --> 01:48:01,414
Yes, I would like to move to approve the amendment to the site plan with the following conditions, stating that the conditions relating to the approval of May of 2023 shall still apply as relevant, that an additional

972
01:48:02,602 --> 01:48:11,806
do not enter signage and stop signage and stop line markings are to be added in the parking area as specified by city staff.

973
01:48:12,627 --> 01:48:29,654
The applicant shall apply for an access permit on Route 16 at the rear of the site, and the applicant shall work to apply traffic calming measures on streets in the surrounding neighborhood as determined by city staff.

974
01:48:30,895 --> 01:48:31,835
And that's so moved.

975
01:48:34,027 --> 01:48:36,410
Okay, can I have a second?

976
01:48:38,612 --> 01:48:39,173
I second.

977
01:48:40,835 --> 01:48:43,017
Okay, so Peter Kelce?

978
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:45,200
Aye.

979
01:48:46,501 --> 01:48:47,162
Ari Fishman?

980
01:48:48,343 --> 01:48:48,483
Aye.

981
01:48:49,124 --> 01:48:50,025
Pam Arianski?

982
01:48:50,726 --> 01:48:50,846
Aye.

983
01:48:51,687 --> 01:48:54,010
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

984
01:48:55,691 --> 01:48:57,833
Thank you for your patience, Mrs. Arthur.

985
01:48:58,013 --> 01:49:03,097
I hope that it is going to be a little, you know, smooth sailing from here for you.

986
01:49:03,117 --> 01:49:03,497
I'm sorry.

987
01:49:03,557 --> 01:49:03,938
Thank you.

988
01:49:04,518 --> 01:49:05,179
No, thank you.

989
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:06,099
Thank you so much.

990
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:11,123
Uh, I just, I like to think I'm passionate, but I know it comes off as something else.

991
01:49:11,864 --> 01:49:12,564
I appreciate it.

992
01:49:12,584 --> 01:49:14,106
And I think we're all waiting for it to open.

993
01:49:14,126 --> 01:49:14,546
Trust me.

994
01:49:15,827 --> 01:49:16,407
Awesome.

995
01:49:16,427 --> 01:49:17,128
Thank you so much.

996
01:49:17,748 --> 01:49:18,469
Have a great night.

997
01:49:18,909 --> 01:49:19,170
Thanks.

998
01:49:20,350 --> 01:49:20,611
Thank you.

999
01:49:24,885 --> 01:49:29,448
The next item on our meeting is approval of minutes from 5-1-24.

1000
01:49:29,548 --> 01:49:31,049
Can I have a motion to approve?

1001
01:49:34,951 --> 01:49:35,511
I second.

1002
01:49:36,092 --> 01:49:37,132
Oh, I'll second.

1003
01:49:38,033 --> 01:49:39,834
Okay, roll call.

1004
01:49:39,974 --> 01:49:40,634
Peter Cowles?

1005
01:49:42,355 --> 01:49:42,455
Aye.

1006
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:43,956
Ari Fishman?

1007
01:49:45,017 --> 01:49:45,137
Aye.

1008
01:49:45,637 --> 01:49:46,598
Pam Baranski?

1009
01:49:47,438 --> 01:49:47,518
Aye.

1010
01:49:48,099 --> 01:49:49,419
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1011
01:49:49,459 --> 01:49:49,900
I'm an aye.

1012
01:49:50,912 --> 01:49:53,513
And so number four would be zoning overhaul updates.

1013
01:49:54,713 --> 01:49:56,214
Alicia will provide an update.

1014
01:49:56,694 --> 01:49:57,214
Director Hunt.

1015
01:50:00,335 --> 01:50:01,515
So we've been moving along.

1016
01:50:01,535 --> 01:50:07,797
I've been trying to forward you stuff as soon as we get them.

1017
01:50:08,657 --> 01:50:11,738
The consultant's been providing memos to the council.

1018
01:50:12,318 --> 01:50:15,499
Right now, the council is on track.

1019
01:50:16,059 --> 01:50:18,300
And Danielle, catch me if I'm wrong on this.

1020
01:50:18,814 --> 01:50:23,996
But what we'd like to do is they're going to review.

1021
01:50:24,116 --> 01:50:40,261
So they reviewed a bunch of stuff last week that they liked that were adding decisions, definitions, can't talk, into the zoning.

1022
01:50:40,821 --> 01:50:47,983
And part of what they were framing this is as first we want to add some definitions so that they exist in our zoning.

1023
01:50:48,443 --> 01:50:50,586
For example, coffee shops, right?

1024
01:50:50,966 --> 01:50:54,950
I don't know if that's one of the ones, but like, let's put some definitions in, have them exist.

1025
01:50:55,011 --> 01:50:57,533
Another one that is definitely on the list is doggy daycares.

1026
01:50:58,635 --> 01:51:14,706
And then after that's all been approved and gone through the process, then while we're looking at maps and zones and corridors, we'll have these additional items that we could be adding to the use table to either include or exclude.

1027
01:51:14,726 --> 01:51:20,010
So you'll actually see that there are some that they'd like to regulate doggy daycares different from kennels.

1028
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:24,553
And they'd like, and like, that's an idea that's been put forward.

1029
01:51:24,573 --> 01:51:26,975
And there's a definition on there for,

1030
01:51:29,316 --> 01:51:32,218
I don't have the exact right words, but a junkyard basically.

1031
01:51:32,659 --> 01:51:38,442
And part of that is because right now there's nothing in our zoning that says, no, you can't put a junkyard in Medford.

1032
01:51:38,723 --> 01:51:42,065
Like you have to say, well, what is that the closest thing to that in our zoning?

1033
01:51:42,725 --> 01:51:51,611
And the idea is that the consultant thinks we might want to say, no, that's not allowed in any zones explicitly so that it's not a question.

1034
01:51:52,492 --> 01:51:56,615
So a bunch of those, so this stage is definitions coming forward.

1035
01:51:57,315 --> 01:52:04,766
so that they'll be there as tools in the toolbox when we start looking at the corridors and squares and zones.

1036
01:52:05,753 --> 01:52:11,657
Another thing is changing up of the tables in order for formatting.

1037
01:52:13,358 --> 01:52:23,765
Right now, the use table is a table that has in next to all the uses a code, A, B, C, D, or E, for what kind of parking requirement there is.

1038
01:52:23,785 --> 01:52:26,387
Those codes are in a separate table.

1039
01:52:30,190 --> 01:52:35,253
And so the recommendation is to take the codes out and just put the parking right there in the use table.

1040
01:52:36,814 --> 01:52:46,039
So you don't have to be going back and forth to different things with no changes to any of what we're actually recommend like what's actually allowed just formatting.

1041
01:52:46,459 --> 01:52:50,602
So that's getting ready to come through in a zoning

1042
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,380
packet to this board.

1043
01:52:54,420 --> 01:53:07,803
With again, the idea that we might want to change what some of the parking requirements are in the city, but it sure would be a lot easier if it was in the table of uses and not a separate table that we're going back and forth with.

1044
01:53:08,903 --> 01:53:19,745
So these things along with a couple of other things that the lawyer is looking at more closely, the city council is going to have another meeting tonight is the

1045
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:22,641
Oh, no wonder I'm confused.

1046
01:53:22,721 --> 01:53:24,602
My calendar on my wall is April.

1047
01:53:25,042 --> 01:53:26,342
I was trying to give you dates.

1048
01:53:26,362 --> 01:53:28,663
All right, so tonight is the 15th.

1049
01:53:28,783 --> 01:53:31,024
They're gonna be looking at them again the 22nd.

1050
01:53:32,045 --> 01:53:44,070
And then the intention is that at their meeting, that is the city council on the 28th of May, is gonna refer the packet to this board for a public hearing.

1051
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:48,892
And Danielle, did we say that we thought we could open that public hearing on

1052
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:50,840
June 5.

1053
01:53:54,903 --> 01:54:03,850
Because I think that they were hoping to get it back to the city council by June.

1054
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:05,411
That sounds like the right.

1055
01:54:05,992 --> 01:54:12,496
So we're going to advertise the hearing before it's actually referred from the city council simply to do the two weeks.

1056
01:54:14,398 --> 01:54:16,039
But you'll see the packet.

1057
01:54:19,407 --> 01:54:23,230
It'll be available by the 22nd, right?

1058
01:54:23,250 --> 01:54:24,071
I'm getting these right.

1059
01:54:24,091 --> 01:54:24,631
22nd, 28th.

1060
01:54:27,519 --> 01:54:36,027
So, we keep sending you the things that are coming through from the memos, and I'd encourage you to read them because that'll help keep you sort of like, oh, this is what they're looking at.

1061
01:54:36,387 --> 01:54:49,239
And if at any time you see anything on any of these memos and you go, I don't understand, or I hate it, or I have a big concern, please tell us right away, because you may be seeing something that we hadn't thought of.

1062
01:54:50,238 --> 01:54:52,599
That is 100% possible.

1063
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:54,339
We look at it from one perspective.

1064
01:54:54,379 --> 01:54:55,820
You guys see things differently.

1065
01:54:57,420 --> 01:55:00,881
So definitely let us know if you see something that you're like, this is weird.

1066
01:55:02,602 --> 01:55:06,503
And it may just be that we all thought it was weird, and then we'll change it.

1067
01:55:08,773 --> 01:55:12,096
But my goal is to sort of have these things come through.

1068
01:55:12,617 --> 01:55:16,261
Everybody gets a chance to see them when they're in the early discussion phases.

1069
01:55:16,901 --> 01:55:25,290
And then that so that by the time that you're seeing it at the public hearing, it's not the very first time you've ever seen these things.

1070
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:27,953
They would have been in the memos that have been coming through to you.

1071
01:55:29,678 --> 01:55:36,362
And if you wanted to ask questions about stuff in those memos in one of these meetings, that's why this is an agenda item.

1072
01:55:36,382 --> 01:55:38,624
You can bring it to the meeting and ask about it.

1073
01:55:39,144 --> 01:55:45,728
And if you would rather just reach out individually or whatever, we're very happy to do that as well.

1074
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:50,912
But for the most part, things are clerical.

1075
01:55:51,332 --> 01:55:55,215
The one thing that so there's one, what I would think of is a

1076
01:55:56,482 --> 01:56:01,065
significant zoning change that we have asked them to move forward now.

1077
01:56:01,746 --> 01:56:09,491
And that is it has come to my attention that in most communities, municipal buildings are not held to the zoning rules.

1078
01:56:09,611 --> 01:56:14,434
Like if you want to put your city hall or your school or your fire station

1079
01:56:14,894 --> 01:56:22,497
with different setbacks or whatever, for whatever government reason, you don't actually have to go and get a variance for it.

1080
01:56:23,918 --> 01:56:29,700
So one of the things that we're looking at is to have municipal buildings be treated like Dover items.

1081
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:36,483
Conceptually, it would be a separate section, but it would basically say that the zoning rules

1082
01:56:36,863 --> 01:56:46,019
don't apply to municipal buildings, but if they trigger any kind of, if they are the triggers for a major project, they would still go through site plan review.

1083
01:56:46,838 --> 01:56:53,560
with the idea that we would want all of those projects to come here through site plan review, but it would be about the things you all look at.

1084
01:56:54,060 --> 01:57:15,566
And if the city says that, for example, for the business purposes of the city, we think that there should be a zero lot line on the new fire headquarters at the back of the building, that that is not something they have to go get a variance for, but it's rather that the city has needs that override the zoning of the city.

1085
01:57:17,477 --> 01:57:32,343
So that is conceptually a change, but I've also asked the consultants to provide just a little bit of background on the fact that apparently it's unusual that Medford zoning is actually being applied to our municipal buildings.

1086
01:57:34,344 --> 01:57:42,607
So that's that, and I think that this idea of an administrative approval, that things that are small, so right now,

1087
01:57:43,908 --> 01:57:58,257
There's like, in my opinion, this great, great American Beer Hall site plan change is at a level that would not have triggered just a straight up administrative approval, but that there could be levels that are administrative approvals.

1088
01:57:58,417 --> 01:58:08,563
Right now, if they want to change where a tree is or shift a crosswalk for some reason, or anything, they can't do that without going back to the board.

1089
01:58:09,828 --> 01:58:19,477
And there should be some level of ability to actually approve changes administratively at a staff level.

1090
01:58:20,978 --> 01:58:24,902
So that's something that we have the consultants and the lawyers sort of working through.

1091
01:58:25,502 --> 01:58:26,703
How do we define that?

1092
01:58:26,723 --> 01:58:27,864
And how do we decide that?

1093
01:58:28,585 --> 01:58:34,110
I think that that's coming in this this round that we're going to see just because it keeps becoming a headache.

1094
01:58:35,772 --> 01:58:35,932
So

1095
01:58:37,463 --> 01:58:40,927
Anything else, Danielle, that you think I should touch on on all of that?

1096
01:58:40,947 --> 01:58:49,557
I think that's everything that's slated for this first.

1097
01:58:51,326 --> 01:58:55,148
The PDD changes, was that going to try to come through this round?

1098
01:58:55,369 --> 01:58:56,029
It might be.

1099
01:58:57,870 --> 01:59:07,898
So as an FYI, Jonathan Silverstein, who is the lawyer that helped us with a bunch of the PDDs, is the lawyer that has been hired to help with the zoning changes.

1100
01:59:08,398 --> 01:59:13,602
So as he helps us bring those projects through the permit process,

1101
01:59:15,269 --> 01:59:22,934
he the staff and he identified things that were weird or awkward or legally confusing.

1102
01:59:23,454 --> 01:59:28,097
And so he was sort of trying to work through that to make some recommendations.

1103
01:59:28,638 --> 01:59:34,962
And one of them might be to combine the PDD and the special permit

1104
01:59:35,482 --> 01:59:38,963
so that a project would get its PDD.

1105
01:59:39,924 --> 01:59:46,146
That would be also wouldn't also need a special permit because it was now an as of right project.

1106
01:59:46,586 --> 01:59:48,327
It would need site plan review.

1107
01:59:48,347 --> 01:59:59,711
So it would just sort of change the like levels of legality and two rounds of public notice for the same project at two boards, that kind of stuff.

1108
02:00:00,452 --> 02:00:04,313
So he was reviewing that and he's going to come back with some recommendations for next week.

1109
02:00:07,542 --> 02:00:14,825
And through the chair, some of these processes that we've gone through, like you've lived through how clunky they are.

1110
02:00:14,925 --> 02:00:18,166
So I think other things are clunky.

1111
02:00:19,327 --> 02:00:19,907
Let us know.

1112
02:00:19,927 --> 02:00:26,650
And it's kind of like until you do it, you don't know that there's an issue with that thing in zoning.

1113
02:00:32,092 --> 02:00:35,773
So May 22nd is the first, is another city council.

1114
02:00:35,793 --> 02:00:36,914
What are they doing at that meeting?

1115
02:00:38,898 --> 02:00:41,420
Hold on, I keep looking at, sorry, the calendar.

1116
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:45,402
So May 22nd will be in the city council chambers and on Zoom.

1117
02:00:47,103 --> 02:00:47,903
Is that subcommittee?

1118
02:00:49,344 --> 02:00:56,348
Yes, it is the city council planning and zoning committee.

1119
02:00:56,368 --> 02:01:04,472
Sorry, I was just pulling these up.

1120
02:01:06,365 --> 02:01:11,671
And that's actually we've actually scheduled those out several like into the next month or two.

1121
02:01:11,691 --> 02:01:14,074
So if it's at all helpful.

1122
02:01:14,314 --> 02:01:23,284
It's called the city council planning and permitting committee, and it's mildly unclear to me if it's actually a subcommittee.

1123
02:01:24,410 --> 02:01:30,533
or if it's like a committee of the whole, it's not on the calendar yet, but it is going to occur.

1124
02:01:30,853 --> 02:01:32,534
We have scheduled it with the city council.

1125
02:01:33,614 --> 02:01:39,957
If you want us to send you the dates we've already scheduled with them to meet with them in June as well, we're happy to do that.

1126
02:01:42,838 --> 02:01:47,060
And that's just to get moving for the packet is not gonna come back.

1127
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:51,162
So I'm trying to figure out the tasks that are coming down the line.

1128
02:01:51,202 --> 02:01:52,563
May 22nd is a meeting.

1129
02:01:53,513 --> 02:02:04,441
And that's a council meeting, but if you were to watch that, that would really prep you for what everything is gonna come in the packet for this board.

1130
02:02:05,407 --> 02:02:10,789
The city council meets only once a month in July and August.

1131
02:02:11,489 --> 02:02:24,352
And so we've been trying to push the concerns to move these forward so that the council could actually vote in June before they go on summer recess on some of these changes.

1132
02:02:24,372 --> 02:02:24,773
So it is...

1133
02:02:30,479 --> 02:02:35,680
May 28th is when we'll be getting the packet that they're going to refer back to us for the zoning amendment changes.

1134
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:38,861
And then they're going to want that back by June 5th, you say?

1135
02:02:39,461 --> 02:02:42,901
No, June 5th is the meeting is this board's meeting.

1136
02:02:43,321 --> 02:02:44,041
Oh, yes.

1137
02:02:44,081 --> 02:02:44,662
June 5th.

1138
02:02:45,202 --> 02:02:48,262
So we need to, Danielle, we need to look at the advertising for this.

1139
02:02:49,622 --> 02:02:51,943
That's coming up on us so fast.

1140
02:02:54,863 --> 02:02:58,104
So June 5th is this board's meeting.

1141
02:02:59,997 --> 02:03:04,780
And I wish, oh yeah, city council is on here.

1142
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:10,183
So they have two meetings, the 11th and the 25th.

1143
02:03:10,323 --> 02:03:12,965
So actually this is perhaps a really good time to bring this up.

1144
02:03:13,525 --> 02:03:17,428
This board meets the first and third Wednesdays.

1145
02:03:18,028 --> 02:03:20,449
The third Wednesday in June is Juneteenth.

1146
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:24,472
City hall is closed, what?

1147
02:03:26,851 --> 02:03:28,452
Um, I didn't understand.

1148
02:03:29,012 --> 02:03:30,852
We talked.

1149
02:03:30,872 --> 02:03:31,773
I'm looking at my calendar.

1150
02:03:31,813 --> 02:03:36,234
We generally have a whole schedules mapped out for the year.

1151
02:03:36,934 --> 02:03:37,514
Okay.

1152
02:03:38,295 --> 02:03:39,795
We are not meeting on Juneteenth.

1153
02:03:40,935 --> 02:03:43,636
That's because it's first and third, except for noted.

1154
02:03:44,396 --> 02:03:45,257
There's okay.

1155
02:03:45,597 --> 02:03:47,657
So we're not it's not it's June 26.

1156
02:03:49,897 --> 02:04:02,461
All right, when we were talking with the consultants they were hoping we were thinking that if this board needed to not pass it the first time but to extend it it would be June 19 because we weren't thinking about that.

1157
02:04:02,921 --> 02:04:05,002
So it could come back to the city council by the 25th.

1158
02:04:08,038 --> 02:04:27,426
But I guess it is my feeling that if the board pays attention to these things that are coming through, perhaps watches the 22nd meeting, that the changes that are coming to you on the 5th are intended to not be big thought pieces.

1159
02:04:27,466 --> 02:04:29,767
This is supposed to be the easy low-hanging fruit.

1160
02:04:30,813 --> 02:04:36,442
And that when we have the big thought pieces, that's when we're gonna need multiple meetings to think about stuff and work things through.

1161
02:04:36,823 --> 02:04:38,626
This is like the prep work.

1162
02:04:51,648 --> 02:05:03,780
And city councils actually kind of they're reviewing it so many times that by the time you send it back to them, they're gonna be ready to just approve it.

1163
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:11,467
And I have actually said to them that the appropriate times for them to make changes is earlier in the process before you get it.

1164
02:05:13,108 --> 02:05:23,993
And that after it comes back from you, if they then think they need to make major changes, it would be because you change something that they, you know, like that kind of back and forth.

1165
02:05:25,674 --> 02:05:34,097
That you should be seeing the version that they're comfortable with since they are the ones working with the consultants to develop this material.

1166
02:05:38,559 --> 02:05:40,260
And if any of you want to come to those meetings,

1167
02:05:41,295 --> 02:05:44,897
You can as long as it's not quorum, right?

1168
02:05:47,038 --> 02:05:50,299
I'll ask Jonathan if you want to come, if you want to participate.

1169
02:05:50,319 --> 02:05:56,422
Is that at all helpful?

1170
02:05:56,902 --> 02:06:02,865
I didn't mean to go on so long about this, but I feel like it's helpful to explain where things are going.

1171
02:06:03,565 --> 02:06:07,407
No, it's giving me context for myself.

1172
02:06:07,647 --> 02:06:09,048
I'm not sure about the other board members.

1173
02:06:13,804 --> 02:06:14,224
Thank you.

1174
02:06:15,604 --> 02:06:17,165
And that's our next meeting.

1175
02:06:17,185 --> 02:06:20,846
So kind of gives you a little preparation.

1176
02:06:20,866 --> 02:06:24,187
And I'll send an email about this to remind.

1177
02:06:24,227 --> 02:06:27,047
But I'm going to be unable to attend the next meeting.

1178
02:06:27,067 --> 02:06:29,488
I have another work conflict that Wednesday.

1179
02:06:29,508 --> 02:06:30,628
Yes.

1180
02:06:31,309 --> 02:06:34,069
Yeah, I put it in the calendar invite that I couldn't attend.

1181
02:06:34,089 --> 02:06:36,470
But if you want me to send an email reminder, I'm happy to do that.

1182
02:06:38,843 --> 02:06:39,403
That's true.

1183
02:06:39,784 --> 02:06:43,085
So we get it on May 28th and we meet on June 5th.

1184
02:06:43,105 --> 02:06:47,968
So we'll be meeting to discuss city council's recommendations to get it back to them.

1185
02:06:48,648 --> 02:06:49,249
Is that how?

1186
02:06:49,869 --> 02:06:50,089
Okay.

1187
02:06:50,169 --> 02:06:50,429
Right.

1188
02:06:51,390 --> 02:06:59,294
Every zoning has to go to the city council to be referred to you for a public hearing.

1189
02:06:59,695 --> 02:07:05,738
You hold a public hearing on it and then you send it to them and they hold a public hearing on it and that's when they vote.

1190
02:07:09,970 --> 02:07:25,355
And I don't want you to think that they're all gonna feel rushed like this, because I think that there are gonna be later ones that are gonna be much more complicated that we think we're really gonna wanna take a couple of meetings to work through, have the consultants come and work through them.

1191
02:07:26,095 --> 02:07:32,117
And we'll confirm, but I'm certain that we're planning to have the consultant attend on the 5th.

1192
02:07:40,278 --> 02:07:43,302
Thank you.

1193
02:07:48,868 --> 02:07:51,671
And are there any other updates from board members?

1194
02:07:51,751 --> 02:07:53,893
Any other questions that you have for city staff?

1195
02:07:59,152 --> 02:08:08,095
Well, I just want to say that I obviously, I am very appreciative of all of you, but I have to give a special shout out to Peter for the way you captured those conditions.

1196
02:08:08,155 --> 02:08:10,716
Because I stare and it's like I fumble.

1197
02:08:10,736 --> 02:08:13,217
And I'm trying to capture them myself on this end.

1198
02:08:13,237 --> 02:08:14,878
And it's like, oh, you read them back.

1199
02:08:14,898 --> 02:08:17,279
I'm like, wait, that's not what I got.

1200
02:08:17,339 --> 02:08:22,841
So I really appreciate your diligence in getting them.

1201
02:08:22,961 --> 02:08:25,102
No problem.

1202
02:08:25,802 --> 02:08:26,443
Glad I could help.

1203
02:08:28,995 --> 02:08:33,598
Okay, in saying that, the final item is a motion to adjourn.

1204
02:08:39,382 --> 02:08:39,842
So moved.

1205
02:08:43,224 --> 02:08:45,365
Second motion to adjourn.

1206
02:08:48,107 --> 02:08:48,607
Second.

1207
02:08:51,969 --> 02:08:54,011
Peter Cowles, roll call.

1208
02:08:54,271 --> 02:08:54,871
Peter Cowles.

1209
02:08:55,992 --> 02:08:56,072
Aye.

1210
02:08:57,147 --> 02:08:57,768
Ari Fishman.

1211
02:08:58,470 --> 02:08:58,590
Aye.

1212
02:08:58,610 --> 02:09:00,313
Pam Mariansky.

1213
02:09:01,896 --> 02:09:01,996
Aye.

1214
02:09:02,837 --> 02:09:04,721
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1215
02:09:04,961 --> 02:09:05,623
I am an aye.

1216
02:09:05,983 --> 02:09:06,805
Thank you, everyone.
