1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's call the roll.

2
00:00:02,061 --> 00:00:02,662
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bears.

3
00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:03,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

4
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:04,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan.

5
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:04,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

6
00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:05,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilwoman.

7
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:06,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

8
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:07,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

9
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:09,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

10
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:11,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins.

11
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:12,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

12
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Four present, one absent.

13
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,772
[SPEAKER_04]: The meeting is called to order.

14
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:29,381
[SPEAKER_04]: At this meeting, we will again revisit paper 24033, offered by President Bears and Vice President Collins, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.

15
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:38,879
[SPEAKER_04]: The agenda says this is the fourth Zoning Updates meeting with Innes Associates, but I think the actual number is higher than that.

16
00:00:38,959 --> 00:01:00,323
[SPEAKER_04]: For this meeting, we have agreed on the following agenda, to look at priority zoning recommendations from the Climate Adaptation and Action Plan, to prioritize zoning recommendations from the 2023 Comprehensive Plan, discussing completing the mapping analysis by June 30, and to discuss new topics that came up during the May 8 committee meeting that should be added to our work plan,

17
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:07,321
[SPEAKER_04]: including legal definitions and formatting and permitting and process.

18
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:11,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Given that, that's a lot to discuss.

19
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:22,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that NS Associates has prepared a memo with a first draft of pulling those zoning recommendations from the comp plan and the climate adaptation and action plan.

20
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:25,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot to potentially go over in that already.

21
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:56,677
[SPEAKER_04]: speaking as one councilor, speaking as the chair, I think my ideal goals for this meeting are to do an overview of the existing recommendations that Innes Associates has already pulled from the cap and the comp plan, to have a discussion on that with councilors towards the goal of at our next committee meeting on June 26, making sure that councilors, Innis and staff all feel comfortable that all of the recommendations that should be pulled from the climate action and adaptation plan and the comp plan

22
00:01:57,145 --> 00:02:15,390
[SPEAKER_04]: have been fully culled, they're all in our work plan, and that we've also talked about assigning priority levels to those zoning recommendations so that we can enter into the new fiscal year feeling like our source documents have been properly vetted and that way we can just approach things by topic and by neighborhood from there on out.

23
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:20,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd also love for us to have a discussion about kind of how we can

24
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:39,354
[SPEAKER_04]: codifying, putting legal definitions in format, permitting and process into the work timeline to make sure that gets baked in, and then discussing what we need to do to make sure that the mapping analysis, which I think is in a draft stage, will be completed and ready for review at the June 26th committee meeting.

25
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:44,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get started with reviewing, I want to pass it off to NS Associates.

26
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Any preliminary comments from Councilors?

27
00:02:53,911 --> 00:03:16,927
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing, and maybe we can talk about it more on the 26th, that I think would be good to at least start talking about is the, and it's kind of in here as the new topics, but the work plan, kind of the two tracks of the work plan that we talked about recently, where we'd have kind of the global citywide

28
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:45,655
[SPEAKER_02]: changes on one track and then changes that are going to require different local neighborhood discussions or essentially the district by district and neighborhood type changes on another track and hopefully kind of try to have that out there well in advance so the residents can be informed and know when we're going to be talking about their neighborhood as it relates to the comp plan and all the other changes we want to make.

29
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:49,216
[SPEAKER_02]: just that I think maybe we can take that to the 26.

30
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:53,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's like a natural next step from this final topic here on our agenda today.

31
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:56,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, president bears.

32
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:57,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

33
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:04,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be great to publish that well in advance so that residents have lots of lead time to know when changes that might affect their neighborhood are coming.

34
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I think it would be a great segue to, I think it could be a great segue to complete this categorization

35
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:17,179
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling from the cap and the comp plan and making sure that we've been thorough and comprehensive.

36
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:28,528
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to me that we might be able to solidify the work plan for the global and the district changes once we kind of have the full scope of what we're looking at and how those might file in.

37
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Any preliminary comments from city staff before I turn it over to Ines Associates?

38
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:37,555
Great.

39
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll turn it over to Paola.

40
00:04:42,799 --> 00:05:03,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I was thinking open to alternative ideas on this, but knowing that we have, uh, reviewing the, um, the memo that was circulated to Councilors last week with that draft of, uh, Zona recommendations pulled from the cap and the comp plan, um, there's quite a lot to discuss in there so far.

41
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we'd probably all appreciate adjourning no later than eight 30.

42
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:15,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, I think that our time could be best served doing kind of a general overview, not going through things necessarily in great detail line by line.

43
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:24,146
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know that my priority is making sure that everything that ought to be on that list is and working on assigning a priority.

44
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:28,529
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we could kind of do a high level overview of what's currently in that memo.

45
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:39,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Paola, and if you could speak to, you know, if there's anything that you particularly think ought to be flagged, anything that didn't make it in, and why I think that that might be most helpful for starting us out.

46
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:42,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

47
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:44,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, everyone.

48
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:51,727
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Paola from Menace Associates, representing Emily, the director.

49
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:57,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And with me is the GIS expert, Jim Irosha,

50
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:02,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yes, I think that what I was.

51
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:07,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, what I wanted to do was going really explaining what we did.

52
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:14,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then ask if there are any, uh, comments or things that you didn't see that you would like to see.

53
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:18,690
[SPEAKER_01]: So get more of the feedback from you instead of reading one by one.

54
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm going to share my screen.

55
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see it maybe a bit better.

56
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:26,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the plan sounds great.

57
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:27,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

58
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:31,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are.

59
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:49,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so as you said, the agenda is about the SONY recommendations from the Climate Adaptation Action Plan and the recommendations from the 2023 Comprehensive Plan.

60
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:56,654
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, we have a list with all of them, each in one table.

61
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:07,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, what I wanted to do today was more to get your feedback on how we do the prioritization.

62
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:13,340
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have an idea and a method, and that's mainly what we wanted to run by you.

63
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,941
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can go step by step.

64
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:20,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that we all agree.

65
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:24,285
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, the first

66
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:29,790
[SPEAKER_01]: topic that we treat was the climate resilience.

67
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:43,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took it from in the in the table, you are going to have the number and the number is exactly the number that is, it's taken by the by the CAP, the Climate Adaptation Action Plan.

68
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:54,118
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see the number, we have the big goals first, and in bold, and then after that,

69
00:07:54,571 --> 00:08:00,296
[SPEAKER_01]: you will see the recommendations that are more specific to this first goal.

70
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:04,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, we have diverse and affordable housing.

71
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,143
[SPEAKER_01]: We explain what it entails.

72
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:16,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the three sub strategies that comes with it.

73
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,253
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see the topic.

74
00:08:20,405 --> 00:08:37,068
[SPEAKER_01]: In this cap, we only use the climate resiliency, but actually, there are more topics that are influenced directly by this, and we will see it later, that we will use to create, to prioritize these strategies.

75
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:38,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does it come from?

76
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,169
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, it's the cap.

77
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:49,251
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after, so the next weeks we want to, as Zach Barrett said, we want to work on the work plan.

78
00:08:49,639 --> 00:09:01,628
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we today wanted to work on the priority, because it will help us to go through the work plan and so that every of these strategies can be more specific to which phase are going to be in.

79
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:11,836
[SPEAKER_01]: In this, in the first table, you will see inside the strategies, these like B51.

80
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:15,659
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes from the zoning memorandum that we've been working.

81
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:22,800
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the strategies and suggestions that came from the Department of Planning and Sustainability.

82
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:32,510
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we did is include these ones in exactly the strategy from the CAB that we thought were more appropriate.

83
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:34,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example,

84
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:40,863
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, the B51 overlay district that has a lot of different suggestions.

85
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:48,107
[SPEAKER_01]: The density zone was applied to this strategy, the BE11B.

86
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that all the way we have the BE12, high-performance new buildings.

87
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:57,673
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes from the CAP.

88
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:03,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from the department, the suggestions about the eco-roof ordinance,

89
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:07,793
[SPEAKER_01]: is in here, or the B49 by right allowances is in here.

90
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:11,154
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried to not have a lot of different tables.

91
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:18,655
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to have one in this case that took all the climate resiliency suggestions into one.

92
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:23,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you will see these bold numbers B51, B52, B47 in here.

93
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,356
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for the climate resiliency.

94
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:47,243
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I go a bit further, we will see the list of objectives and actions typed in changes, but this comes from the comprehensive plan.

95
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:50,265
[SPEAKER_01]: So in here, we did the same.

96
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:51,586
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the number of it.

97
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:55,109
[SPEAKER_01]: The main one, it's in bold.

98
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:03,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the more specific are later on in normal letters, not usable.

99
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:06,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have the topics, the main ones.

100
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:12,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, as the other ones, sometimes we have several because it's not only one.

101
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:17,212
[SPEAKER_01]: These usually overlap and usually almost always overlap with different topics.

102
00:11:17,712 --> 00:11:24,996
[SPEAKER_01]: But here we try to do the main ones that affect these strategies.

103
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:34,249
[SPEAKER_01]: In here, this table is only for the comp plan, so that for now it's easier to see and not to have them all together and overlap.

104
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:40,673
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's exactly the same as the other one.

105
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:55,083
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the number, the specification, so the description of the strategy, the topics that are treated and the origin, and we will work on the phase and the priority

106
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:57,168
[SPEAKER_01]: the 26th.

107
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:12,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I was expecting is that if you have any doubts or if you have any comments on this, that we will love to hear about them.

108
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:21,742
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want to show you is, and maybe we can do this after, what we have prepared is also how to treat priority.

109
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:25,204
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we can do is that I stop here at the moment

110
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:27,566
[SPEAKER_01]: we can see if there are any doubts.

111
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:30,489
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want me to read one by one, I can totally do that.

112
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:41,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if there is any specific that you want to tell me about, we can go to those specific strategies.

113
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go first to President Bears.

114
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:49,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

115
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:52,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just had one, I think this is great.

116
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:57,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had one quick change from the Climate Adaptation Action Plan.

117
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:09,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that BE 1.1 should probably be like an HP or maybe HPHA instead of in CR, but the rest of that did seem to be climate.

118
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,436
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's how I read BE 1.1.

119
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this one's yeah, I understand.

120
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:29,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will come also later, because it does affect climate resiliency in because you have more, maybe it's the density, change densities, and so on.

121
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:31,434
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has different topics.

122
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:38,777
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, they are very intertwined, it's difficult to take one without the other.

123
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:44,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is what we are going to use later for the prioritizing the

124
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,979
[SPEAKER_01]: The strategies affect different topics.

125
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,200
[SPEAKER_01]: The more they affect, the more impact they are going to have.

126
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a way of prioritizing them.

127
00:13:54,121 --> 00:14:01,923
[SPEAKER_01]: But so what I can do and what I wanted to do is to add also main topics that also are affected by this.

128
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:07,825
[SPEAKER_01]: So I totally agree that this one should be H-A-C-R so that we have both in them.

129
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think H-P as well.

130
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:11,286
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hear what you're saying.

131
00:14:11,306 --> 00:14:12,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I think adding to the list makes sense.

132
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,110
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see later what I mean.

133
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:20,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

134
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:29,537
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of the CAAP, you know, recommendations seem pretty solidly in the climate resiliency bucket to me.

135
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now we get back down to the accessible neighborhoods and maybe I'm, yeah, I can see something that could have some overlap there as well.

136
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:42,966
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the idea of going through, I don't know,

137
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:55,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, maybe we could go through the bolded ones like the, with just the one point, you know, without the sub letters and maybe we could prioritize those first.

138
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:57,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's okay.

139
00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:58,955
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can go now.

140
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to go now?

141
00:15:00,957 --> 00:15:01,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, Paula.

142
00:15:01,457 --> 00:15:02,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just to jump in quickly.

143
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a great place to start.

144
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I'm looking through this, you know, I think my priorities for the 26th is, and if we, if there's a way to

145
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:31,335
[SPEAKER_04]: have this reflected in the updated table, if we can kind of be in a process of over the next two weeks, kind of as much as possible, disaggregating the zoning goals with the specific zoning strategies, or replacing some of the goals with specific strategies to achieve them.

146
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I think how you have it laid out for today is great.

147
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:40,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that, you know, through our discussion and revision over the next couple of weeks, it can be, you know, kind of more like left column,

148
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:46,968
[SPEAKER_04]: goal that this recommendation is pointing to, column next to that, here are the specific zoning changes that would get us closer to that.

149
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:57,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe the bolded headings right now are, for the most part, the goals that have specific strategies attached to them at the moment.

150
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:00,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we start there?

151
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:08,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And Paolo, was it your intention that we would kind of start there and we could also be talking about prioritization as we're going through those strategies?

152
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:12,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Hunt, I want to recognize you if you had a comment.

153
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:13,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have missed your hand.

154
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:22,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having a little trouble following some of this.

155
00:16:25,473 --> 00:16:32,658
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of it is, I just want to, for anybody who's following who is lost, the key for the topics is at the very bottom of the chart.

156
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:38,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is all, if anybody is watching, this attachment that we're looking at is,

157
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:41,504
[SPEAKER_08]: in the handouts for this meeting.

158
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:46,787
[SPEAKER_08]: But the key that tells you what CRHPHA are is in the bottom.

159
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:55,011
[SPEAKER_08]: But there isn't actually a key to the letters on the left in the left-hand column.

160
00:16:57,452 --> 00:17:06,156
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am having trouble remembering what all of these things stand for, because they're not ringing a bell from either the climate plan or the

161
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:12,563
[SPEAKER_08]: comprehensive plan, the WSVP in the left-hand column.

162
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:24,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a little bit confusing, and I just wanna make sure, it seemed to me, I was trying to follow, some of these are goals, these are not things that we're gonna do, right?

163
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:35,061
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to try to achieve them, and many of them are actions, and it wasn't actually clear to me that only the things that are bold are goals.

164
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:46,683
[SPEAKER_08]: And so some of these things, like how do we properly separate some of these?

165
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:49,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you, Director Hunt.

166
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:58,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I think that's, you more eloquently put the point I was trying to make just now, which is right now we have the goals and some strategies to achieve them in the same column.

167
00:17:58,308 --> 00:17:59,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's totally fine for a first draft.

168
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:13,075
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that it's important for the, you know, comprehensive and updated version that we look at in a couple weeks that we separate the actual strategy that's being recommended of this body from what's the point of this?

169
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:13,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are we doing this?

170
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,177
[SPEAKER_04]: What goal does it relate to?

171
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:17,139
[SPEAKER_04]: And what topic does that goal fit within?

172
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:22,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's a matter of just a column getting added if we have number

173
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:27,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Sarah Silver, PB): Goal and then recommended zoning related action or something along those lines.

174
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,415
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, I think it's confusing to have goals and strategies aggregated together.

175
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:31,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Sarah Silver, PB): Right.

176
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:39,246
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think part of it is, for example, under be the very beginning is a great example though that diverse and affordable housing housing.

177
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,167
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a title.

178
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:48,197
[SPEAKER_08]: But actually 1.1a, reduce zoning barriers to multifamily and mixed-use housing development is the thing I think we're gonna do throughout this entire process.

179
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:55,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And enables, although enables small and more diverse housing options through zoning updates.

180
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:57,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we're doing the zoning updates.

181
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,682
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanna keep that in mind as we do this, that those are some of our goals of the entire process.

182
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:07,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see that one recommendation is to create an overlay district.

183
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:13,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas there are other things in here that are seeing much more actions.

184
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:19,194
[SPEAKER_08]: And that maybe we need a separate list of like, what are our high level goals?

185
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:20,756
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just a separate table.

186
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:23,778
[SPEAKER_08]: These are our high level goals that you could keep referring back to them.

187
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:26,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And here are things that we're going to do throughout.

188
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:32,485
[SPEAKER_08]: And a little bit of it is because I'm anxious to actually getting to changing

189
00:19:33,143 --> 00:19:38,145
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about actually in this district, what in this area, what do we want the borders to be?

190
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:40,105
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do we want the dimensions to be?

191
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:42,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do we want to add for performance standards?

192
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:44,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, 100%.

193
00:19:44,687 --> 00:19:53,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that I'm feeling similarly, you know, I think it's this is necessary runway up to getting to the point where we're taking votes on strategies that get us there.

194
00:19:53,289 --> 00:20:02,192
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're here to take votes on the strategies that will allow us to actually to actually reduce the zoning barriers to multifamily and mixed use housing development, for example.

195
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:18,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, you know, just to restate as one Councilor, my priority is to make sure that every, every, every strategy that has been put into the cap and the comp plan so far as a change that we could vote on and make that would achieve these goals.

196
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that that's in this table or an updated version of it.

197
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:28,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that, you know, at the beginning of July, what we have is a list is essentially a to do list.

198
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:53,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I think for today, you know, I think all of this aligns with what you were talking about is making sure that discussing what's here, if there's any flags that are raised from Councilors are the things that strategies that are in here that are confusing or strategies that aren't in here that we think should be, um, and to work on, you know, assigning perhaps a priority level to the strategies that are already inside as a bears.

199
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it might also be useful to both of your points to look at this.

200
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:22,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we can do what you just said and kind of go through this and put some general priorities down, but I think it might actually be useful to, instead of have like almost a turn the table, like instead of having the numbers and headers from the plans be like the defining column, but to have the topics be the column, and then we could split it out into goals and actions

201
00:21:23,188 --> 00:21:24,248
[SPEAKER_02]: grouped within the topic.

202
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:30,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we're kind of doing it just as like, if this was a spreadsheet, I would just move a column and then sort it differently.

203
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:30,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

204
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:44,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, and I think it might, like, it might be useful for us to take, like, I generally think that most of the things in bold here are goal statements and most of the sub headers are like different

205
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:47,899
[SPEAKER_02]: possible actions that could happen within each topic.

206
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:58,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might be useful for us to have a table, like take the goals that are under each topic and kind of come up with what you just said, Alicia, like a general goal statement for each topic area.

207
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:01,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I think these are a great starting point.

208
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:02,315
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably would

209
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:09,310
[SPEAKER_02]: narrow them down a little bit so we don't have like a nine bullet point kind of necessarily goal statement.

210
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:16,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And then have the specific recommended strategies in there as well.

211
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think the other piece of this, like to Alicia's point, like I think there's two things we can do here, right?

212
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:21,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Like

213
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:43,589
[SPEAKER_02]: One is, there's one track of this that's like, we want to look at all of our district and our map, and we want to talk about what uses we want and what places, what dimensional requirements we want in which places, and essentially what we want neighborhoods, corridors, and squares to look like across the city.

214
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's what are things that we want to be

215
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:53,044
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in all of those districts for all of the new construction, right?

216
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:59,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we, like some of the, um, climate resiliency type stuff, like we're going to want new construction generally.

217
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:06,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it's not in all of them because I don't, I don't know how the building code interacts with quite frankly, that's a piece of it.

218
00:23:06,612 --> 00:23:10,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot less, uh, understanding of, but, um,

219
00:23:12,116 --> 00:23:17,058
[SPEAKER_02]: general guidelines that we would want to apply to the entire city.

220
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:34,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it's, um, it's the climate resiliency and the housing affordability and the, to an extent, the economic development and business growth and the transportation and multimodal ways like those seem to me to be more like we want complete streets everywhere.

221
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:37,204
[SPEAKER_02]: We want net zero construction everywhere.

222
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:41,626
[SPEAKER_02]: We want, um, you know, more housing affordability everywhere we want

223
00:23:42,478 --> 00:23:46,499
[SPEAKER_02]: more business growth in all parts of the city and what are policies that can do that.

224
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:48,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's one track of things.

225
00:23:48,339 --> 00:24:09,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's a track of things that is, this is kind of the specific like form, um, of, you know, the shape and size of structures and the vision of lots and like what, um, and the heights and densities in different parts of the city, um, and redrawing the boundaries and barriers of, uh,

226
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,428
[SPEAKER_02]: of the zoning district.

227
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:18,794
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that just to me, I think is a good, a way that I could think about this a little more clearly.

228
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:35,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think to like, just taking that, maybe taking these, all of these topics and putting them into those two buckets and then taking kind of resorting this, um, list of recommendations from the climate and comprehensive plans.

229
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:42,428
[SPEAKER_02]: to have be like shorter tables under each topic area could be a way of organizing it.

230
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:59,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I also think we could go through today and at least talk about prioritizing some of these, but again, it, yeah, like I, my top priority is reducing zoning barriers to multifamily and mixed use housing development.

231
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:05,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also probably something in the, uh,

232
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:15,311
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not necessarily undertaking corridor and commercial center studies, but allowing an appropriate mix of uses and land controls for cohesive development along corridors and within squares.

233
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:17,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those are my two big ones.

234
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:18,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

235
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:19,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

236
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:20,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

237
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I would co-sign those priorities.

238
00:25:24,018 --> 00:25:31,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but in terms of our strategy for today, um, you know, I think we're all eager to get, put some,

239
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:52,818
[SPEAKER_04]: to successfully get through the part of the process we're figuring out how to fit these goals on the page in a way that makes our work easier so that we can proceed along to the point where we're actually discussing the material changes that are being recommended to achieve the goals that are being articulated in the updated version of the spreadsheet or any others.

240
00:25:53,579 --> 00:26:01,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And it made me think about the flowchart or spreadsheet that's in the implementation section of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan itself, which

241
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:07,303
[SPEAKER_04]: always stuck with me because I found it so readable and useful.

242
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:19,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe I think what we're talking about is like a one step more granular version of that, where right now, like that has... I think that's exactly what I was just looking at.

243
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,690
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I laughed.

244
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I mean, that's what's been sticking in my brain because that implementation matrix is so useful.

245
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:28,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I can bring it up if you give me a second.

246
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:32,076
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an implementation matrix at the back of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.

247
00:26:34,564 --> 00:26:36,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I can bring that up unless somebody has it at their fingertips.

248
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:41,848
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think like, if I might, when the air blows, you have to project more because it's hard.

249
00:26:42,028 --> 00:26:44,209
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the white noise is making it hard to hear you.

250
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:44,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

251
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:45,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

252
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:48,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guarantee I am trying as hard as I possibly can.

253
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:51,872
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the microphone.

254
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:52,412
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not you.

255
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:52,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

256
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:54,873
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's so frustrating.

257
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:58,795
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little box up there, a little cardboard box.

258
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:02,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

259
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:11,342
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to make a supplemental appropriation for a little Barbie mic for me so that people can hear me for the first time ever.

260
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:13,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on one sec.

261
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:17,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pull up the CAP plan.

262
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:31,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I have here the topics in this list.

263
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:43,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia, the BE and all this EN that you're seeing there, it's over here.

264
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:47,629
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the main goals from the CAP and the main goals from the COMP plan.

265
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:56,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it here because I wanted to use this so that you can help me or I can get your feedback on the importance and rating these big goals.

266
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:01,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sorry for that.

267
00:28:02,043 --> 00:28:10,086
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to simplify it as much as possible to just get the priorities first.

268
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:14,988
[SPEAKER_01]: But I agree that there is still a lot of work to do.

269
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,768
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a work in progress.

270
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:28,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we also want to group all these strategies in the sections of the zoning that needs to be changed so that we only do these things once.

271
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:58,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the strategies that, for example, are talking about changing dimensions and uses or that are about standards, to group them so that we know that, OK, let's change the dimensions in order to achieve these goals and all these strategies, and so that we pass only once and we don't have to do that many times going from goal to goal.

272
00:28:58,564 --> 00:29:05,589
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of ways and different ways to continue to explore this and group to make it as easy as possible.

273
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:10,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, I agree with all your suggestions.

274
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:15,756
[SPEAKER_01]: We can separate goals and then do another column for the specific strategies.

275
00:29:16,576 --> 00:29:22,580
[SPEAKER_01]: We will add also the part of the zoning that needs to be changed and altered in order to achieve that.

276
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all have, okay, this is about the dimensions,

277
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:35,242
[SPEAKER_01]: the standards on these on mixed use or in this district, and so that we have all those also.

278
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:38,143
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't want to bring a lot of information.

279
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:39,524
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already a lot.

280
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:46,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really wanted to focus on having this kind of rating so we can prioritize a bit better.

281
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:51,168
[SPEAKER_01]: But totally, I agree with everything you've said.

282
00:29:51,188 --> 00:29:53,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Paola.

283
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:54,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate that.

284
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,325
[SPEAKER_02]: this is really helpful, this table.

285
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:00,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

286
00:30:01,448 --> 00:30:02,510
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that's great.

287
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:08,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Just since we're talking about it really quickly, I'm going to share my screen.

288
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:21,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is not as useful as I thought it would be because the version of the cap that's on the city website has the way that two page view works is it's just flipped.

289
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:31,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's on the left should be on the right, but I think this gives an idea at least of, you know, this kind of stepping down towards granularity.

290
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:35,402
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the word I'm looking for?

291
00:30:36,823 --> 00:30:38,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Visual layout that we're looking for.

292
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:59,734
[SPEAKER_04]: or at least that I'm kind of thinking of, of starting with the goal and then saying within this, you know, and maybe what I mean by making this more granular is instead of here having strategy and action is having, you know, replacing that action with the specific zoning change that's recommended to achieve that goal or that strategy.

293
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:05,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So just, I just wanted to provide a visual guide for what I was, what we were describing earlier since we were talking about it.

294
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, sorry that this page is

295
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:10,403
[SPEAKER_04]: flipped, but I think this gives you a better idea.

296
00:31:11,424 --> 00:31:35,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that I like about this, just in terms of a template, I think it's helpful to have a snapshot of a timeline over which, as we get into strategies that will require more research, more neighborhood meetings, I think it would be great to have a snapshot of the time that we might need to take on those strategies.

297
00:31:38,948 --> 00:31:43,632
[SPEAKER_04]: and like other benchmarks kind of in the same spreadsheet.

298
00:31:44,733 --> 00:32:04,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And Paola, you mentioned that maybe for next time as we pursue all the updates that we've discussed so far in the updated version of the spreadsheet, I think it would be great to have a link to where specifically in the zoning that update or addition might occur as we get into specific strategies.

299
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that would be really helpful.

300
00:32:08,191 --> 00:32:21,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really appreciate you, you know, trying to pace us into this and I speaking for probably not only myself, I know that we're all really eager to get through the phase of visioning and talking about strategies and getting into the nitty gritty.

301
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:26,999
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for not throwing us into the deep end, but as one Councilor, I'm eager to be thrown into the deep end.

302
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:35,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we return to kind of a conversation of prioritization at this point, I'll make sure at the end that we're kind of all clear on

303
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:39,127
[SPEAKER_04]: the updates to the spreadsheet that we wanna see for next time.

304
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:39,987
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

305
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:44,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we take a look at the kind of more simplified tables that Paula just said?

306
00:32:44,888 --> 00:32:45,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great.

307
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:55,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think it might be better to like go through those than to go through each of the, I think that sounds like what you were saying, Paula, if I heard you right.

308
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:57,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.

309
00:32:57,211 --> 00:33:01,532
[SPEAKER_01]: So our idea today was to have this exercise of

310
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,903
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the topics, the big goals from the CAP.

311
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,925
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the big goals from the COMP plan.

312
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:13,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Associated with this, we also included the different topics that are related to them.

313
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:23,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And this comes, as you said, Alicia, at the end of the document.

314
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we start writing all this HA, housing affordability,

315
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,464
[SPEAKER_01]: house production, economic development, it just, it gets too messy.

316
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:39,646
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why this is so helpful, but it is in the document.

317
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:45,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I wanted to show you is how we would do it.

318
00:33:46,711 --> 00:33:52,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's to prioritize it's at some point, it gets very subjective.

319
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:59,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we wanted is to make it as subjective as possible and to work with

320
00:34:00,211 --> 00:34:12,459
[SPEAKER_01]: how much impact this strategy has and to somehow have a number or give a number to that, how impacted it is.

321
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,462
[SPEAKER_01]: We developed this like three questions.

322
00:34:16,002 --> 00:34:21,686
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is, do this strategy appears in both plans or only in one?

323
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,847
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the first question that we make.

324
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:27,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, for example, you see here the B1,

325
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,862
[SPEAKER_01]: and the WS11 that are very similar in their intent.

326
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:40,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that these will appear in both.

327
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:43,804
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of important if it has some kind of overlap, right?

328
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:53,086
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have, the second question is how many topics are involved in these two, in these strategies?

329
00:34:53,746 --> 00:34:56,467
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have, for example, here under we have

330
00:34:56,854 --> 00:35:03,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this one will talk about affordability, production, economic development, climate resiliency.

331
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:15,177
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, it's directly, but a bit less than the others or less influence than the others, will be the corridors and the uses and districts.

332
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:16,558
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are also there.

333
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:19,678
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that these have a huge impact.

334
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:23,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third question that we ask is, is it

335
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:31,827
[SPEAKER_01]: a strategy that should be applied in the whole city, or is it a strategy that is applied only to certain areas, right?

336
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:35,870
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is like the third thing that we look in order to rate it.

337
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:41,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, for example, this BE11, it's rated as an importance of five.

338
00:35:44,335 --> 00:35:46,256
[SPEAKER_01]: All these strategies are important.

339
00:35:46,738 --> 00:35:53,422
[SPEAKER_01]: and that we are rating it a bit less, it doesn't mean that we're not going to make them or that we're not going to care about them.

340
00:35:53,842 --> 00:36:03,187
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to help us to create this work plan and to focus on very big and important and the efforts where we wanted to place them.

341
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:11,652
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't mean that we are not going to worry about others that will have a less kind of importance rate that I wanted to make very clear.

342
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:17,070
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we have this another example, and this is the high heat mitigation.

343
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:20,272
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very important.

344
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:28,536
[SPEAKER_01]: It appears in both plans, but it's so specific that it only affects climate resiliency directly.

345
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:33,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Indirectly, it affects many things, but let's say directly only that topic.

346
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:38,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because it's that specific, we have it as an importance of two.

347
00:36:38,973 --> 00:36:43,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a bit of how we will do this with these strategies.

348
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:48,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were only some examples.

349
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:52,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we wanted for me today is having this in mind.

350
00:36:54,816 --> 00:37:08,039
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to go through all these topics and if we could rate them, if you could rate them and give us the feedback, which ones do you really think that are five or

351
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,068
[SPEAKER_01]: three or one.

352
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:13,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need all the numbers, but something like that.

353
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have prepared.

354
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,190
[SPEAKER_01]: This board so that and Jimmy is there to help me.

355
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:37,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Um so that we have here all the big goals and that Jimmy will help me to assign each color is for one of the Councilors or city members and to start

356
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:47,959
[SPEAKER_01]: putting these post-its on the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 rating, if there's something that you would like to test.

357
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:56,524
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we talk and discuss, Jimmy is in the background doing this, so then we can take it home with all your opinions.

358
00:37:57,324 --> 00:38:03,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something that you would like to do, or do you want to have a bit more time to process this?

359
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:04,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.

360
00:38:07,094 --> 00:38:09,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I recognize President Bears, thank you.

361
00:38:09,556 --> 00:38:12,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a very creative way to do this exercise.

362
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:17,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Just my first instinct is I'm kind of of two minds on this.

363
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:19,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is an exercise we could do synchronously.

364
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:23,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is something that Councilors could do asynchronously as well.

365
00:38:29,815 --> 00:38:47,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there also could be value in kind of going through a row and discussing that to kind of make sure that we're aligned on rating systems and then making sure that additional feedback is sent back to Innocence City staff on a reasonable timeline over the next week, perhaps.

366
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:55,672
[SPEAKER_04]: In any case, I do just want to acknowledge that we also want to talk about the status of the mapping analysis.

367
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:56,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

368
00:38:58,328 --> 00:38:59,229
[SPEAKER_04]: tonight and it's 7.45.

369
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:12,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we are going to have a conversation about prioritization, I just think that we should probably try to keep that to no more than 30 minutes to make sure that we get through the rest of our agenda and have time to get solid on our plan for June 26th.

370
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:15,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Councilor Leming, you are next and then President Bears.

371
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:18,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Paola.

372
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:26,083
[SPEAKER_09]: I do appreciate the energy that has clearly been put into breaking down a very

373
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:34,197
[SPEAKER_09]: complicated set of topics down and simplifying it for us.

374
00:39:34,357 --> 00:39:44,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I would personally be of the mind that I do want to engage in the rating exercise, but I fully agree that it can be done offline.

375
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:50,520
[SPEAKER_09]: And perhaps there could be a motion to do that before the next meeting, before this has ended.

376
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,001
[SPEAKER_09]: What I would like to ask you is in terms of these

377
00:39:56,141 --> 00:40:00,124
[SPEAKER_09]: general topics that you've seen from the comprehensive plan and the cap plan.

378
00:40:00,244 --> 00:40:07,769
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do understand that there are certain things that are very broad and there's certain things, like you said, the heating that were very specific.

379
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:09,310
[SPEAKER_09]: What

380
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:23,039
[SPEAKER_09]: very, and it's going to be very difficult for y'all to come up with something that can integrate all of the themes from both of these into one comprehensive zoning plan.

381
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:26,940
[SPEAKER_09]: What, from your impressions,

382
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:37,277
[SPEAKER_09]: could there really be, do you really see there being like contradictions when you're actually trying to implement these things?

383
00:40:37,457 --> 00:40:50,790
[SPEAKER_09]: So if, you know, there is, could be, you know, there could be a need for better transportation, there could be a need for more affordable housing, there could be a need to

384
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:55,754
[SPEAKER_09]: make buildings more energy efficient.

385
00:40:56,074 --> 00:41:07,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see any of these things in a single zoning plan strongly contradicting each other when you really get down to the nitty gritty?

386
00:41:08,323 --> 00:41:10,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to hear your general thoughts on that.

387
00:41:12,706 --> 00:41:15,648
[SPEAKER_01]: So to be honest, no, I think that this is very well done.

388
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:20,372
[SPEAKER_01]: The CAP and the COMP plan are very well done plans

389
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:30,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that these things actually help each other, so that when you actually do one goal, you're actually helping the others to also be implemented.

390
00:41:31,927 --> 00:41:41,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe when you go to the very specific, we would have some contradictions, but I expect very minor things, to be honest.

391
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:44,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this all works towards the same direction.

392
00:41:45,223 --> 00:41:49,625
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I see from the cap, from the comp plan and both together.

393
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:54,988
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of overlap because they have the very similar goals.

394
00:41:56,529 --> 00:42:05,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the moment, nothing has popped up that to me saying this really, this goes really both ways.

395
00:42:05,934 --> 00:42:08,435
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that is everything that I've seen.

396
00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:11,077
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, it's been on the same

397
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:14,048
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think it's a very good path.

398
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:20,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so when we're rating things, it's not like we're saying you should do this instead of this.

399
00:42:21,212 --> 00:42:22,813
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no.

400
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:33,499
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to use this to make the working plan and to help us a bit to do this strategy.

401
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:41,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it doesn't mean that when some of the strategies can be, let's imagine that one of the strategies is lower

402
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:48,306
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that we're not going to do it or that we're going to leave it at the end, because sometimes things need to go in packs.

403
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:56,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can have a very high priority, medium priority, and low priority going all in one package together.

404
00:42:57,068 --> 00:43:11,751
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to help us understand, to make a strategy of how to work this, and to really put our time where we all agree that is needed from the beginning.

405
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:13,944
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's only about that.

406
00:43:14,004 --> 00:43:19,207
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that we don't think it's important or that we don't think that we should do it.

407
00:43:19,748 --> 00:43:28,153
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that all of the things that are here and that are on the plan on the tables, I think are great and all of them should be done.

408
00:43:31,135 --> 00:43:31,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

409
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I could just jump in and then I'll recognize you, President Bears.

410
00:43:36,978 --> 00:43:41,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that because the goals and topics that we're talking about are

411
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:44,306
[SPEAKER_04]: In one sense, they're things that we're constantly talking about.

412
00:43:44,326 --> 00:43:48,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, for many of us, that's why we're in office, because we want these goals to be achieved.

413
00:43:48,769 --> 00:44:03,080
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're all completely aligned that these are, all of these are high priority in terms of creating a prioritization system that will help NS Associates, you know, know in what orders we present things to us and to city staff.

414
00:44:05,388 --> 00:44:13,294
[SPEAKER_04]: The more I think about it, I think it could be a productive thing for us to do in between committee meetings, perhaps over the next week so that NS has enough time to digest it before our next committee meeting.

415
00:44:14,394 --> 00:44:22,481
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, you know, for myself, one way I might approach this in terms of what would I really want to be high on the priority list would be either things that are most achievable.

416
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:24,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get it done.

417
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:31,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that Councilors might have, you know, we could look at priorities at the topic level or just at the specific strategy level.

418
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:36,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And some topics might be high priority because the strategies that go along with them are high priority.

419
00:44:38,287 --> 00:44:51,070
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, knowing that this issue of priority topics is something that we think about, you know, so constantly, I would be inclined to, you know, focus our thinking on, you know, what information and what format is in us,

420
00:44:52,239 --> 00:45:05,943
[SPEAKER_04]: most need to be able to, you know, put together a functioning helpful work plan from us so that we can hasten to that part where we're kind of looking at specific zoning strategies and seeing where in the zoning court that lines up with.

421
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:14,066
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, eager to hear other Councilors perspectives on this, but I think it might be productive over the next week if Councilors can, you know,

422
00:45:15,572 --> 00:45:28,442
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of do a look back through the topics and the goals that we're thinking about and writing about and emailing constituents about all the time and say, you know, here's my ranking or here are the strategies that I think really have to be in the first three months.

423
00:45:30,384 --> 00:45:32,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I am pretty confident there'll be a lot of alignment.

424
00:45:35,468 --> 00:45:35,948
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

425
00:45:38,691 --> 00:45:43,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I was following up until the kind of timing element of it.

426
00:45:45,987 --> 00:45:48,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you saying that a number would mean a time?

427
00:45:48,308 --> 00:45:49,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry?

428
00:45:49,648 --> 00:45:53,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a five would mean three months, a four would mean six months or something like that?

429
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:53,710
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

430
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:54,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

431
00:45:55,990 --> 00:46:02,212
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just, I just meant like, as a way for councillors to say, this is what feels most urgent to me.

432
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:03,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

433
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's okay.

434
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:10,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the, what is, it's called a Miro page.

435
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:12,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what I saw, Paula?

436
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:13,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

437
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:16,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that able, like, could that be shared?

438
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we edit that separately?

439
00:46:17,814 --> 00:46:20,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be worth it personally.

440
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:30,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand that people don't want to do it this way, but I could, I think we could spend five minutes and each of us pick a row and, you know, you guys can pick a row.

441
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,122
[SPEAKER_02]: We can pick a row and we can just move them now and then we don't have to wait.

442
00:46:35,602 --> 00:46:38,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can talk about why things are where they are for 10 minutes.

443
00:46:40,044 --> 00:46:41,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I just worry if we do it asynchronously,

444
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:51,787
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, there's no collective time for us to interpret it until the next time we want to talk about it, which is when we want it to be done.

445
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:52,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

446
00:46:52,627 --> 00:46:57,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I know it's kind of fast, but I feel like I could do it.

447
00:46:58,889 --> 00:46:59,029
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

448
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:04,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know, kind of by the same token, because this is topics that we're constantly immersed in.

449
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:07,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that we need a lot of time to digest these topics.

450
00:47:10,112 --> 00:47:12,153
[SPEAKER_04]: So for us to be doing it.

451
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:18,309
[SPEAKER_01]: For the sharing, it's a bit, it's going to take a bit of time.

452
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:27,351
[SPEAKER_01]: What we had in mind was to just go one by one, tell us, and then Jimmy in the background is going to put it in the place.

453
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:29,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

454
00:47:29,612 --> 00:47:41,896
[SPEAKER_01]: So that if that's okay, if you want to, if we can just go one by one so he can just write it, he will write your name.

455
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:46,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for example, the black is the first person that wants to talk.

456
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:50,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he will start moving them into the rating system.

457
00:47:51,684 --> 00:47:51,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

458
00:47:52,024 --> 00:47:52,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the problem.

459
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:54,405
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been talking for an hour.

460
00:47:54,425 --> 00:47:56,866
[SPEAKER_08]: This should take us three hours tonight.

461
00:47:56,946 --> 00:47:59,987
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no way that we can do this in a reasonable length of time.

462
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:08,650
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was a little bit confused whether you wanted us to rank just those high level topics, which we can't, they're all important.

463
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,731
[SPEAKER_08]: To rank the individual strategies, we can.

464
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,132
[SPEAKER_08]: but that will take us hours.

465
00:48:15,313 --> 00:48:16,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, I'm sorry.

466
00:48:16,714 --> 00:48:22,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I think we, why don't we talk about the other things we wanted to talk about this evening and then see where we are.

467
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very much on the other side of that.

468
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:28,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we could take the top level topics.

469
00:48:28,584 --> 00:48:28,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

470
00:48:28,925 --> 00:48:38,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm not ranking ensure affordable housing for all over, you know, create 12, you know, the economic development one versus the networks one, like,

471
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I felt very comfortable doing that.

472
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:50,599
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not to say that they're not, I think this is about importance in terms of timing, right?

473
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:51,540
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm hearing.

474
00:48:51,660 --> 00:49:04,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if I could step us back for a second, Paola, could you recenter us on what, from your perspective for your work plan after tonight, what the utility of our prioritization is?

475
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:07,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is that to put that in order of what you present to us?

476
00:49:08,055 --> 00:49:14,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, say that we order it, number one, housing, number two, business development, number three, climate resiliency.

477
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,401
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that influence?

478
00:49:15,441 --> 00:49:23,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that influence, okay, we're gonna package up all of the recommended zoning strategies for the committee in July, and then in August, we'll do the next one.

479
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:28,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what's the causal relationship between the prioritization and what we do next?

480
00:49:29,493 --> 00:49:31,895
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, the prioritization,

481
00:49:33,075 --> 00:49:35,297
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do it as I was telling you.

482
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:39,440
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the way we would do it in each of the big strategies, we would do it like this.

483
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:48,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And one way of doing it is we do it with all the strategies we send it to you and you can tell us, yes, no, we agree, we do not agree.

484
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:59,717
[SPEAKER_01]: The prioritization is mainly to create the work plan, what things we go first, what things we leave for later.

485
00:50:03,315 --> 00:50:07,678
[SPEAKER_01]: and to just see where we spend the most of our time.

486
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:24,228
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that it's not important and it's not that I need, I mean, I imagine that it's very difficult and that's why we, I didn't want to push you into do this and to give us our feedback because I understand that for

487
00:50:24,744 --> 00:50:28,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people can be very difficult because they don't know like climate resiliency is very important.

488
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:30,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Housing is very important.

489
00:50:31,049 --> 00:50:33,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So I totally understand that it's difficult.

490
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:52,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we can do is we work the prioritization, we work the work plan, we present it to you, and you can tell us if you think that that is correct or if you think that this topic should go or this strategy should go first or this strategy,

491
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:54,990
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it either way.

492
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:03,133
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too difficult to say and prioritize, because I understand, and maybe the goals is very difficult.

493
00:51:03,273 --> 00:51:08,316
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier when you go strategies by strategy because it is more specific.

494
00:51:08,376 --> 00:51:16,379
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, as I said, the climate, the heat mitigation, it's very specific.

495
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:17,860
[SPEAKER_01]: It can come later.

496
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And first, we can really go for the ensure affordable housing for all.

497
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand that that is that makes sense.

498
00:51:26,685 --> 00:51:31,551
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you go through climate resiliency or housing, maybe you don't have it as clear.

499
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:37,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to cut you off.

500
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:39,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Callahan has had her hand raised.

501
00:51:39,021 --> 00:51:39,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

502
00:51:40,112 --> 00:51:40,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

503
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:53,690
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems to me that really, if we're just talking about timeline the most important thing is we don't choose to do one thing first, that we will realize when we then look at something else, but those are conflicting.

504
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,014
[SPEAKER_03]: So, things like for example.

505
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:00,457
[SPEAKER_03]: creating more affordable housing and the natural environment.

506
00:52:00,558 --> 00:52:03,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if we're gonna be like zoning, great, we're gonna zone everywhere for tons of housing.

507
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:12,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're like, oh, when we get to natural environment, we're like, oh crap, like we forgot that we actually meant to also prioritize this.

508
00:52:12,968 --> 00:52:23,057
[SPEAKER_03]: So can we just look to see which ones could conflict with each other and make sure that we look at those at the same time or close to each other?

509
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, President Bears.

510
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what this is.

511
00:52:28,282 --> 00:52:30,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Examples of rating strategies section is great.

512
00:52:31,244 --> 00:52:45,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes similarly grouped things from multiple plans, says which topics they're in, if you could scroll down a little bit, and then kind of says, okay, there's like seven strategies, it falls under six topics, that's a five.

513
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:53,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you scroll down to the next one, it's like, yeah, we want Medford to be, we want to mitigate heat islands, right?

514
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:57,201
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three strategies, it's only climate resiliency.

515
00:52:57,762 --> 00:53:00,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So it addresses that conflict question, right?

516
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,537
[SPEAKER_02]: That first topic, that's across six of our topic areas.

517
00:53:05,137 --> 00:53:10,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to talk about that discreetly because if we talk about it by topic area, it's not gonna be useful.

518
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:26,730
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded to me like Paola was saying, if we could kind of just as a general thing, take these top goals, that that would provide them input as they go through these strategies to help inform what they think of as basically creating

519
00:53:28,226 --> 00:53:30,231
[SPEAKER_02]: these little strategy summaries for each thing.

520
00:53:30,311 --> 00:53:32,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, to me, that's valuable.

521
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:35,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not saying this is more important than the other.

522
00:53:35,665 --> 00:53:36,206
[SPEAKER_02]: It's saying

523
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:41,850
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to me, it's easy for me to say, okay, I think all of them are important.

524
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:42,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to do all of them.

525
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:46,614
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some of them that I would call a five and some of them I would call a two.

526
00:53:47,074 --> 00:53:48,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Heat islands, I care about them.

527
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:51,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I think it's as urgent as the fact that nobody can live here?

528
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:51,578
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

529
00:53:52,138 --> 00:53:56,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So calling housing affordability a five and calling heat islands a two, which is what it is in here.

530
00:53:56,822 --> 00:53:58,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that as an example.

531
00:53:59,377 --> 00:54:07,483
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounds like the two options are we could either give a little bit of input now to help guide, or they could just do it themselves, and then we can come back with our changes later.

532
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,265
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it seems valuable.

533
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:11,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at this point, it's eight o'clock, maybe we should just not do it.

534
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:16,210
[SPEAKER_02]: We should just say, go ahead, Ines, and come up with it.

535
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,252
[SPEAKER_02]: But that seemed to me to be where we were.

536
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:27,439
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a minute, but that does seem to be a valuable exercise to me to take five minutes and say, this goal is a five, this goal is a three, this goal is a two,

537
00:54:28,317 --> 00:54:37,964
[SPEAKER_02]: and hopefully that informs the work plan more than just having them develop it themselves without that kind of something to guide them.

538
00:54:38,464 --> 00:54:38,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

539
00:54:39,225 --> 00:54:39,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

540
00:54:40,225 --> 00:54:40,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Callahan.

541
00:54:40,766 --> 00:54:54,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to follow up on the point I was making and see if our planning department has any particular thoughts on that question, because I'm not convinced that the rating system that they came up with covers what I'm talking about.

542
00:54:54,955 --> 00:54:57,377
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, if we're like affordable housing,

543
00:54:57,841 --> 00:55:01,523
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna do that first and then mitigating heat islands is gonna be last.

544
00:55:01,864 --> 00:55:04,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Those could in fact be in conflict with each other.

545
00:55:04,205 --> 00:55:09,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas I think 18 hour communities and balanced growth are less in conflict with each other, but I don't know.

546
00:55:09,428 --> 00:55:16,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to ask and see if you just have any initial thoughts that you could put in on that.

547
00:55:16,993 --> 00:55:24,138
[SPEAKER_03]: If any of these goals are things that if we don't consider them at the same time, we might regret it later.

548
00:55:28,204 --> 00:55:29,745
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, Danielle, I'm a senior planner.

549
00:55:31,045 --> 00:55:36,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I'm having trouble with the ranking exercise, too, and I did it in conflict.

550
00:55:36,887 --> 00:55:56,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the strategies of increasing housing density would move forward increasing affordable housing, but to not be in conflict with some of the climate goals, you want to make sure you're going up in height and not completely covering

551
00:55:57,796 --> 00:56:02,659
[SPEAKER_06]: the lot, so we wouldn't want 100% lot coverage where it's all hardscaped.

552
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,741
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like it's all woven together.

553
00:56:05,761 --> 00:56:08,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, yeah.

554
00:56:09,944 --> 00:56:20,251
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, I mean that we tackle one of these strategies first, it doesn't mean that we completely forget about the rest of the things that we have in our plan.

555
00:56:22,052 --> 00:56:24,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of things can go together.

556
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:26,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we think that it might be a conflict,

557
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:39,340
[SPEAKER_01]: so that if we have higher density, maybe we need to put together with certain strategies of climate resiliency.

558
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:45,124
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever we see that there needs to be a balance to put them in the work plan together.

559
00:56:46,725 --> 00:56:49,848
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely, we have some areas that are more dense.

560
00:56:49,908 --> 00:56:55,232
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be aware that with climate resilience in mind, there are other areas that we need to

561
00:56:55,848 --> 00:57:05,555
[SPEAKER_01]: not have SDANs, and so that locked coverages are not everywhere 100%, I think that that is very clear for us.

562
00:57:07,076 --> 00:57:08,277
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe what we can do is

563
00:57:09,554 --> 00:57:26,020
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever we see that some of these things might be in conflict, as I say, it really goes into very specific, because generically, I don't think they go in conflict, but when you go into the specific, could be, it's a matter of balance.

564
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:31,122
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really about, you cannot do this, because then you can't do the other.

565
00:57:31,563 --> 00:57:35,284
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about having a balance between both, and so that we can work

566
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:42,149
[SPEAKER_01]: in the work plan that we can put this together, even if it's high priority, lower priority, they can go in together.

567
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:53,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think that I got all your opinions and the part that worries you, I totally understand it.

568
00:57:53,631 --> 00:57:59,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we can do is come up with the work plan that address all these issues.

569
00:58:02,033 --> 00:58:02,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Paola.

570
00:58:06,155 --> 00:58:21,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking about a path forward here, it strikes me that there might be a way to thread the needle here where we're giving a little bit more exposition during this committee meeting and the time that we have left.

571
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:29,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe we could go round the horn and have the Councilors give a top level

572
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:36,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I think like maybe the word prioritization is like was throwing us off a little bit at the beginning of the meeting.

573
00:58:36,185 --> 00:58:45,852
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it's not about like what what are we not doing, but rather like what's very important to do first and thinking about prioritization at the same time as we're thinking about pairing.

574
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:48,695
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it make sense to do first with urgency?

575
00:58:48,735 --> 00:58:50,156
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it make sense to do together?

576
00:58:50,649 --> 00:58:53,451
[SPEAKER_04]: knowing that we're not going to be considering any of these strategies in a vacuum.

577
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:56,832
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we could possibly take 10 minutes.

578
00:58:57,013 --> 00:59:00,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Jimmy is just working on the mirror board in the background.

579
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:17,224
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could go around and have Councilors kind of give their impressions, you know, again, and I don't really think this counts as off the top of our head because these are goals that we think about constantly as we're doing city business, you know, to give some impressions of if it's not the full one through five, but what's my one and two.

580
00:59:17,284 --> 00:59:19,385
[SPEAKER_04]: We could just go around to take two minutes each and do that.

581
00:59:20,087 --> 00:59:36,557
[SPEAKER_04]: councilors felt more comfortable, we could, you know, spend 15 minutes on the mapping analysis to make sure we're in good shape to have a complete version of that submitted to us ahead of the June 26 meeting, and then we can come back and do two or three minutes each per councilor on the prioritization.

582
00:59:37,438 --> 00:59:44,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's just one proposal for me, is to go around and leave NS Associates with just a little bit of feedback from each of us before the end of this meeting.

583
00:59:45,483 --> 00:59:46,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll recognize Councilor Leming.

584
00:59:48,188 --> 01:00:04,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so I asked to be recognized before the chair made the proposal, but I was actually going to make a motion to just have this emailed to Councilors after the meeting so that we could submit our feedback.

585
01:00:06,296 --> 01:00:09,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And then outside the meeting, maybe

586
01:00:10,646 --> 01:00:23,555
[SPEAKER_09]: have Paola forward the sticky note page to us and then move on because I don't, given the fact that we all do tend to talk quite a bit, I do it too, I'm doing it right now.

587
01:00:24,095 --> 01:00:28,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would take more time than what we have left.

588
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:35,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, I think that what I was proposing was a very explicitly pared down version of, I think certainly I could talk for

589
01:00:36,909 --> 01:00:48,658
[SPEAKER_04]: an hour about the topics before us, but I think if we wanted to entertain the idea of saying, everybody has one minute, everybody has 90 seconds, everybody has two minutes, you don't have to say you're one through five, you can just say you're number one and number two.

590
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:56,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And then certainly, you know, Councilors are always welcome and encouraged to submit further feedback and ideas to NS Associates.

591
01:00:57,605 --> 01:01:01,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So me as chair at any time, we could certainly follow up with additional context over the next week.

592
01:01:01,608 --> 01:01:06,732
[SPEAKER_04]: So we kind of have, let's decide on a path forward.

593
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:11,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I see one vote for taking a minute or two each.

594
01:01:13,195 --> 01:01:14,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

595
01:01:26,943 --> 01:01:35,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we should step away from this for 20 minutes and talk about the mapping analysis, because that's another very big piece that we haven't talked about yet to make sure that we have adequate time for that.

596
01:01:36,394 --> 01:01:39,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if we're left with five minutes, we can spend five minutes talking about our priorities.

597
01:01:39,957 --> 01:01:47,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if Paola could just send that table that's in that document that you were just on, Paola, I can send it back with, I can just fill the whole thing out and send it back.

598
01:01:47,883 --> 01:01:48,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

599
01:01:48,984 --> 01:01:51,225
[SPEAKER_02]: If you email it now, I can send it back to you in five minutes.

600
01:01:51,926 --> 01:01:56,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

601
01:01:56,490 --> 01:02:03,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Paola, if you could circulate that by email, if you could send it to me and President Bearson, or President Bearson, the clerk,

602
01:02:04,062 --> 01:02:07,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just that little table that you were just on in the prioritization of strategies.

603
01:02:10,186 --> 01:02:11,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I will do that.

604
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:15,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Jimmy can move the.

605
01:02:15,129 --> 01:02:16,529
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?

606
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:20,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Jimmy can move the sticky notes around by my next meeting.

607
01:02:49,207 --> 01:02:50,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Just let us know when you're sorted, Paola.

608
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:52,329
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sent it to Zach.

609
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:54,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great.

610
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:55,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

611
01:02:56,271 --> 01:02:59,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, and we'll try to revisit that in 15 or 20 minutes.

612
01:03:01,802 --> 01:03:03,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go now to the mapping analysis.

613
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:07,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for preparing this memo.

614
01:03:08,323 --> 01:03:08,863
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

615
01:03:08,903 --> 01:03:30,147
[SPEAKER_04]: So my understanding is on June 26, the intent is to have these lists and bullet points manifested in an actual series of maps for us to review that, you know, demonstrate the analyses that will guide us as we do our, implement our global and district-wide

616
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:33,400
[SPEAKER_04]: zoning change strategies throughout the rest of this process.

617
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:41,506
[SPEAKER_04]: But Paola, can you just give us a idea of what is left to be done on the mapping analysis before the next committee meeting?

618
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:47,992
[SPEAKER_04]: The intent, the goal of the mapping analysis and what's needed from councillors to complete it?

619
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:50,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

620
01:03:50,754 --> 01:03:52,055
[SPEAKER_01]: So with me is also Jimmy.

621
01:03:52,155 --> 01:03:53,976
[SPEAKER_01]: He's our GIS specialist.

622
01:03:54,777 --> 01:03:54,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And

623
01:03:56,624 --> 01:04:04,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would like to do several sets of maps with the analysis.

624
01:04:05,111 --> 01:04:07,453
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to start with a non-conforming analysis.

625
01:04:08,013 --> 01:04:15,459
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is to see which are the parcels that are non-conforming in each of the zoning districts.

626
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:23,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will analyze the frontage, setback, height, lot size, the minimum building coverage, and lot coverage.

627
01:04:24,526 --> 01:04:26,228
[SPEAKER_01]: These two are mainly

628
01:04:27,259 --> 01:04:31,541
[SPEAKER_01]: lot coverage, and the impervious surface.

629
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:35,723
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a different definition than in your zoning.

630
01:04:35,763 --> 01:04:41,285
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why these two words, I need to change them.

631
01:04:41,305 --> 01:04:51,690
[SPEAKER_01]: But it mainly is that we are going to do frontage, setback, height, size, lot coverage, and impervious surface.

632
01:04:52,411 --> 01:04:55,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that we will do in nonconforming.

633
01:04:56,335 --> 01:04:57,836
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to prepare a base map.

634
01:04:58,196 --> 01:05:03,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just the base map that we will use to project all these different topics.

635
01:05:04,118 --> 01:05:14,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And this base map will have the main characteristics of Medford in order to be easy to read.

636
01:05:14,762 --> 01:05:22,806
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the important things that should be on the map so that it's easier to read.

637
01:05:22,826 --> 01:05:25,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the river, the fells, train stations, and so on.

638
01:05:26,972 --> 01:05:35,920
[SPEAKER_01]: In here, because we started already and at the beginning, these were the things that we will do on the base map.

639
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,582
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have all these together.

640
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:44,528
[SPEAKER_01]: So chapter 91 lands, hydrography and wetlands, the FEMA, open space, parks and trails.

641
01:05:44,948 --> 01:05:47,250
[SPEAKER_01]: This is too much information to have in one.

642
01:05:47,731 --> 01:05:49,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we are going to do is have a base map.

643
01:05:50,153 --> 01:05:53,456
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have another one with all the hydrology information.

644
01:05:54,261 --> 01:06:07,491
[SPEAKER_01]: the Chapter 91 lands, hydrography and wetlands, and the FEMA, and another one with the recreational map with all the open space, parks, and trails.

645
01:06:07,632 --> 01:06:09,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we go to the residential clusters.

646
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:20,442
[SPEAKER_01]: These will be all the parcels with all the different residential units that are in

647
01:06:22,418 --> 01:06:25,859
[SPEAKER_01]: This is mainly to see the density on the map.

648
01:06:26,679 --> 01:06:36,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So a single unit, two unit, three unit, and then four to nine, 10 to 20, plus 20, and then the rest of the non-residential uses.

649
01:06:37,783 --> 01:06:45,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we will have transit and accessibility, all the local transit stops, routes, and bike paths.

650
01:06:47,067 --> 01:07:01,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will have bike paths, blue bike, MBTA bus routes, MBTA train routes, and then the quarter and half mile radius around the major transit nodes.

651
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:13,708
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy for us to understand, or walking is an interesting distance to do walking movements.

652
01:07:14,925 --> 01:07:16,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'd like to do socioeconomics.

653
01:07:17,627 --> 01:07:26,754
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is ethnicity, income, age, all by the census tract, and then environmental justice population.

654
01:07:27,675 --> 01:07:29,196
[SPEAKER_01]: The sixth one will be the value.

655
01:07:29,236 --> 01:07:33,920
[SPEAKER_01]: So building value, land value, and total value all in one map.

656
01:07:35,101 --> 01:07:43,267
[SPEAKER_01]: The set that we call anchors with all the municipal assets, major institutions, major employers, and retail and service centers.

657
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And then housing stock and historic location.

658
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:54,489
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the different ages of the existing houses stock is split into decades.

659
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:57,031
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the historic properties.

660
01:07:57,652 --> 01:08:03,117
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all the different sets that we would like to do before 26.

661
01:08:03,157 --> 01:08:04,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jimmy is...

662
01:08:07,475 --> 01:08:09,777
[SPEAKER_04]: very hard for that overview.

663
01:08:09,937 --> 01:08:18,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that'd be really helpful in guiding us for both of the tracks that we're talking about global strategies and district strategies.

664
01:08:18,943 --> 01:08:27,989
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think my, my only question at this point is, you know, what do you need from councilors or city staff to complete these by our next committee meeting?

665
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:31,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So that we can do these?

666
01:08:33,132 --> 01:08:33,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are.

667
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:37,467
[SPEAKER_01]: gathering all the information at this point.

668
01:08:38,607 --> 01:08:41,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Jimmy has everything we need.

669
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:47,494
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jimmy, if there is anything that you need to add, please let them know.

670
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can add to that.

671
01:08:51,656 --> 01:08:52,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Kit, for asking.

672
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:55,619
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have all the data I need.

673
01:08:55,639 --> 01:09:02,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one data set that would be of use is a neighborhood data set, if you guys have anything that

674
01:09:04,813 --> 01:09:09,498
[SPEAKER_00]: signifies, you know, shape files for each specific neighborhood for Medford.

675
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:12,921
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I have all the data that I need to complete the mapping.

676
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:15,403
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

677
01:09:15,743 --> 01:09:17,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I speak to the neighborhood thing for a minute?

678
01:09:17,966 --> 01:09:24,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so you know, we have maps with neighborhood names on them, but we have never drawn the lines.

679
01:09:25,151 --> 01:09:29,254
[SPEAKER_08]: because that results in people arguing a lot about the borders.

680
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:43,564
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I feel like for the purposes of analysis, if it's helpful, like there are some lines that could be drawn and some of them are bleedingly obvious, like Fellsway West and Fellsway borders, right?

681
01:09:43,784 --> 01:09:47,547
[SPEAKER_08]: That cuts, divides neighborhoods and the river divides neighborhoods.

682
01:09:48,628 --> 01:09:54,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll provide you with the map that has like the names, but the names don't have lines around them.

683
01:09:55,908 --> 01:09:58,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I mean, that would be great regardless.

684
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:03,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't plan to use the boundaries for any sort of analysis.

685
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:06,250
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more for a visual representation.

686
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:17,873
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you said, if people are gonna get up in arms about it, just a text for the neighborhood would be fine for the map.

687
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:19,573
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that, Alicia.

688
01:10:20,623 --> 01:10:22,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you, Paola and Jimmy.

689
01:10:22,464 --> 01:10:25,565
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to hear that this is continuing apace.

690
01:10:26,366 --> 01:10:28,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Councilor Callahan has to depart in just a minute.

691
01:10:29,587 --> 01:10:38,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any additional comments on the mapping analysis or should we start our very quick bullet point prioritization to round out the meeting?

692
01:10:38,672 --> 01:10:39,072
[SPEAKER_04]: President Paris?

693
01:10:39,508 --> 01:10:49,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just wondering, are we going to be able to see these different layers on top of each other and be able to have just two layers on at a time or one?

694
01:10:49,451 --> 01:10:51,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how exactly is that going to work?

695
01:10:57,373 --> 01:10:57,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

696
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:00,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, absolutely.

697
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:06,955
[SPEAKER_01]: You can set the layers to have it on and off so that

698
01:11:07,438 --> 01:11:11,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever we need certain information, we just use that information.

699
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:15,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the sets with absolutely all the information that we're going to have.

700
01:11:16,065 --> 01:11:31,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in order to do different analysis, we can have the base map and then we want the residential clusters, but we only want to see the very high density and the value of those buildings so that we can mix and match.

701
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:35,019
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to be helpful for our analysis.

702
01:11:35,714 --> 01:11:38,736
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the moment, these are the thematic buckets.

703
01:11:39,256 --> 01:11:44,799
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we will have is all these analysis are going to be there for us to use.

704
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:47,120
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we want to mix and match.

705
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:49,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Paola.

706
01:11:49,161 --> 01:11:49,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited.

707
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:51,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'll be a really flexible tool.

708
01:11:52,283 --> 01:11:52,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

709
01:11:52,643 --> 01:11:55,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to see that in our next committee meeting.

710
01:11:58,346 --> 01:12:00,527
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I apologize for the quick pivot.

711
01:12:01,107 --> 01:12:02,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should start our

712
01:12:03,817 --> 01:12:11,520
[SPEAKER_04]: quick recap of priority rankings, priority call-outs, so that we can get to that before councilors have to start leaving.

713
01:12:13,081 --> 01:12:15,181
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, let's do a quick one or two minutes.

714
01:12:15,662 --> 01:12:16,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be as short as you need it to be.

715
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:22,084
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's any impressions, ranking, prioritizations, those topics, Councilor Callahan, start with you.

716
01:12:22,776 --> 01:12:23,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

717
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:33,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have four that I would say are from my four priorities, housing, the 18 hour community and specifically creating walkable neighborhoods.

718
01:12:33,946 --> 01:12:42,094
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, little neighborhood centers, and then buildings and energy but really

719
01:12:42,674 --> 01:12:48,498
[SPEAKER_03]: like two thirds of our emissions come from buildings, and almost all of our buildings are existing buildings.

720
01:12:48,538 --> 01:12:57,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not really focused on the new building stuff, but anything we can do for existing buildings, which I know is not easy and zoning and the natural environment.

721
01:12:57,624 --> 01:12:58,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So those would be my four.

722
01:12:58,544 --> 01:12:58,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

723
01:13:00,766 --> 01:13:01,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

724
01:13:01,727 --> 01:13:02,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

725
01:13:04,789 --> 01:13:05,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

726
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:07,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

727
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:12,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I think my recommendations are similar to Councilor Callahan's.

728
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:14,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Housing is my first priority.

729
01:13:15,511 --> 01:13:21,533
[SPEAKER_10]: On the climate front, I think it makes sense given where our carbon emissions do come from to attack the buildings and energy.

730
01:13:22,454 --> 01:13:23,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So top two for me.

731
01:13:24,014 --> 01:13:37,265
[SPEAKER_10]: And then going after that, the walkability aspect of things, the accessible 12 and 18 hour communities is up there, although I think multi-modal networks does tackle that as well.

732
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:47,833
[SPEAKER_10]: I would put the mobility one as my fourth.

733
01:13:49,955 --> 01:13:50,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

734
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:52,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

735
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:54,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

736
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:57,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Affordable housing and transportation.

737
01:13:57,043 --> 01:14:00,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

738
01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:01,327
[SPEAKER_04]: President Paris.

739
01:14:02,408 --> 01:14:03,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

740
01:14:05,531 --> 01:14:08,653
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one I have a question about is the encouraged balanced growth.

741
01:14:13,297 --> 01:14:16,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a balance of commercial and residential?

742
01:14:18,911 --> 01:14:24,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's about house production that makes use and economic development.

743
01:14:24,997 --> 01:14:26,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the big topics that need treated.

744
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:28,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like the economic development one.

745
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

746
01:14:29,661 --> 01:14:41,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Then yeah, it would be for me the affordable housing and for all the growth, balanced growth and coordinating mobility and development.

747
01:14:44,614 --> 01:14:45,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think

748
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:50,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, outside of that, I'll leave it at those three.

749
01:14:52,099 --> 01:14:59,001
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I was to pick a fourth, I'd probably pick Achieve and Evolve, the 2022 Climate Action Plan.

750
01:15:00,181 --> 01:15:09,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like buildings and energy, I mean, I'm sure there's more we can do, but I just think also, it seems to me that the new building code that we've adopted also just mandates a lot of new stuff.

751
01:15:09,345 --> 01:15:12,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, how much further do we wanna go down that road first?

752
01:15:14,596 --> 01:15:16,497
[SPEAKER_10]: if I may, I think that makes a lot of sense.

753
01:15:17,077 --> 01:15:25,759
[SPEAKER_10]: And I actually think that point actually includes a lot of what Councilor Callahan and I were thinking about buildings and energy as well.

754
01:15:25,959 --> 01:15:37,021
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, if it matters, you can update and replace the buildings energy thing in my lists with the 2022 climate action adaptation plan.

755
01:15:42,383 --> 01:15:44,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Tsengin, President Paris.

756
01:15:47,124 --> 01:15:50,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, unsurprisingly, I agree with all of what's been said.

757
01:15:50,705 --> 01:16:07,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that my top four would be affordable housing, courage, balanced growth, climate resiliency, and achieve slash evolve the 2022 Climate Action and Adaptation Plan with the same

758
01:16:08,271 --> 01:16:16,066
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces of context that were just stated you know looking at that in the context of what does the most recently adopted building code already mandate for us but I know that.

759
01:16:18,331 --> 01:16:38,495
[SPEAKER_04]: to use my full 60 seconds, I think that what's most exciting to me in this zoning project is doing, you know, implementing every strategy that we can around affordable housing, encouraging that mixed use commercial development along our corridors, and implementing, you know, the full extent of our incentives and mandates around energy efficiency for our largest developers in the community.

760
01:16:39,755 --> 01:16:43,896
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to, you know, street level climate resiliency changes.

761
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:48,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

762
01:16:52,497 --> 01:17:01,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Paolo, we can be sure to send you my notes from this conversation, the clerk's notes to make sure that you have everything that you need to capture that.

763
01:17:04,151 --> 01:17:20,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if it is also useful to have Councilors do a more mural style exercise to send to you in the next couple of days or to provide additional context, I'm sure that Councilors would be amenable to that.

764
01:17:21,426 --> 01:17:21,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Director Hunt?

765
01:17:23,089 --> 01:17:43,364
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I might add something, as we're talking about developing a work plan, I think that I just want to sort of put out there where I think the urgency is, that there's a lot of stuff in our plan and in things we want to do that would encourage better growth, denser growth, more affordable housing,

766
01:17:43,905 --> 01:17:50,450
[SPEAKER_08]: that's all important things that should be done thoughtfully, intelligently, and we should get it done.

767
01:17:51,131 --> 01:17:59,578
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think there are some things that are urgent, because there are developers and property owners along Salem Street, so the Salem Street corridor,

768
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:03,847
[SPEAKER_08]: and the Mystic Ave corridor that are looking at what they're allowed to do by right.

769
01:18:04,748 --> 01:18:19,824
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are gonna build new buildings by right, unless we rezone them to what we want to see there, which frankly is denser, is more, is some mixed use in general, right, in a broad term.

770
01:18:20,324 --> 01:18:22,567
[SPEAKER_08]: And that I think that it's actually more urgent

771
01:18:23,047 --> 01:18:32,938
[SPEAKER_08]: that we move forward on, like, as much as I'd like to say, let's talk about, you know, ADUs, but right, and to allowing two families throughout the city, things like that.

772
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody building a new one family isn't going to prevent lots of new two families.

773
01:18:39,426 --> 01:18:53,637
[SPEAKER_08]: but if large parcels on Mystic Ave get developed to two-story industrial buildings, because that's what's allowed there as of right, so if somebody came in, we couldn't actually stop it, where what we wanna see is more.

774
01:18:54,097 --> 01:19:05,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the priority and the urgency is around rezoning our corridors into things that meet these, that talk about affordable and multimodal connectivity

775
01:19:05,851 --> 01:19:09,033
[SPEAKER_08]: that respect the environmental pieces of it.

776
01:19:09,974 --> 01:19:13,657
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanna sort of put that out there and where I think our priorities should be.

777
01:19:14,277 --> 01:19:15,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

778
01:19:15,779 --> 01:19:16,459
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

779
01:19:16,579 --> 01:19:16,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

780
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:21,503
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can say- Sorry, Paola, we're gonna go to President Bears real quick and then we'll come back to you.

781
01:19:21,983 --> 01:19:24,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's why I wanna take the two track.

782
01:19:24,285 --> 01:19:33,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think it, and I was even saying in our meeting, like one meeting a month on these global questions, one meeting a month on like specific areas, and then we can take the,

783
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:41,354
[SPEAKER_02]: most urgent corridors, I agree with those two being primary ones sooner than later.

784
01:19:41,954 --> 01:19:49,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully if we can put out something in July, we can do, you know, Mystic Ave in September, Salem Street in October, then we can go to the other squares and corridors.

785
01:19:50,220 --> 01:20:00,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And similarly, so we could start looking at the, you know, some of the global housing affordability and economic development type things earlier in the fall.

786
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:07,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the one question at the end of that is like, when do we come up with the coherent, you know, map?

787
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:17,373
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and does that, is that map end up being the product of a number of changes or not?

788
01:20:17,773 --> 01:20:19,013
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an open question to me.

789
01:20:19,133 --> 01:20:22,115
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, like, that's kind of why I would like to see us go in that direction.

790
01:20:22,135 --> 01:20:31,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, each month, this group can have one meeting to talk about each of those two tracks and hopefully outpace some of the stuff you're talking about.

791
01:20:34,175 --> 01:20:34,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

792
01:20:34,515 --> 01:20:36,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those last two points are very well taken.

793
01:20:36,896 --> 01:20:45,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm hopeful that the 26 can be kind of our final meeting of this style where we're talking about kind of discussing how to discuss.

794
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,900
[SPEAKER_04]: We're workshopping how to work.

795
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:52,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And then with the product of the mapping analysis and what comes out of this work plan.

796
01:20:53,463 --> 01:20:56,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hopeful that in June, we can start that cadence of

797
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,461
[SPEAKER_04]: one meeting that's talking about global strategies.

798
01:21:01,661 --> 01:21:15,225
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, personally, I would love to see us begin June with, you know, one meeting that's talking about global housing strategies, what's most actionable to get started on, knowing that any changes we advance will, you know, for the most part be bundled with other strategies that make sense and they're coherent with.

799
01:21:15,686 --> 01:21:19,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And then two weeks later, a meeting that's talking about a really priority district issue.

800
01:21:19,547 --> 01:21:26,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think, Director Hunt, your point is really well taken, that there are some corridors that we, you know, we really have to get to,

801
01:21:26,573 --> 01:21:31,716
[SPEAKER_04]: if we want them to look the way that they need to look for the future and the development that we wanna see.

802
01:21:34,177 --> 01:21:34,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's plan for that.

803
01:21:36,338 --> 01:21:36,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Paola, go ahead.

804
01:21:38,579 --> 01:21:46,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the thing for the priority, what we were doing was to use two strategies.

805
01:21:46,283 --> 01:21:50,405
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to look at the importance and that is how much impact this strategies has.

806
01:21:50,886 --> 01:21:52,326
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is urgency.

807
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:55,548
[SPEAKER_01]: So what things are really urgent that we need to do it

808
01:21:56,388 --> 01:21:56,608
[SPEAKER_01]: now.

809
01:21:57,148 --> 01:22:05,070
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one doesn't take the importance of the other, it's just that we need to look at both.

810
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:19,193
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that Mystic Avenue and Salem Street are important to look at, so that in our plan will also go pretty much really above, because it's something that is really urgent.

811
01:22:19,693 --> 01:22:24,914
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to do this, we needed to look at what is important, what is urgent, and have this kind of

812
01:22:25,697 --> 01:22:32,880
[SPEAKER_01]: charged with important, not urgent, important, very urgent, and to come with a strategy.

813
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,360
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really complex.

814
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,621
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many, many things.

815
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:39,423
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand that we want to do them all at once.

816
01:22:40,023 --> 01:22:40,763
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not possible.

817
01:22:40,783 --> 01:22:45,065
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we wanted to create some guidelines to tackle them.

818
01:22:45,445 --> 01:22:51,847
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, urgency is also something that we are taking into account to work on our work plan.

819
01:22:52,628 --> 01:22:53,028
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

820
01:22:54,858 --> 01:23:17,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Paola, and I think that that matrix of importance and urgency will be really helpful to us in determining exactly what to talk about when, kind of to the point of what we were just talking about and the point that Director Hunt raised with the example of the uses currently allowed by Right on Mystic Ave, or sorry, in industrial zones.

821
01:23:19,977 --> 01:23:22,019
[SPEAKER_04]: with that being said, just one thing.

822
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:26,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might be also useful for us at some point to maybe it's not on the 26.

823
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:38,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's in a July or August meeting to have the break out the neighborhood squaring quarters topic into the actual neighborhood squares and corridors and like prioritize physical areas of the city.

824
01:23:39,893 --> 01:23:43,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the mapping analysis will help a lot with that, which is I suggest maybe for July or August.

825
01:23:46,462 --> 01:23:47,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, agree.

826
01:23:47,082 --> 01:23:48,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll add that as a note.

827
01:23:48,703 --> 01:23:51,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And we might have to put some lines around some neighborhoods.

828
01:23:51,703 --> 01:23:52,644
[SPEAKER_02]: People might have to deal.

829
01:23:52,864 --> 01:23:54,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really stepping in.

830
01:23:57,545 --> 01:23:59,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Just taking a quick note.

831
01:24:00,605 --> 01:24:00,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

832
01:24:01,366 --> 01:24:05,147
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to, we have a conflict with the 26.

833
01:24:05,247 --> 01:24:10,088
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to reschedule the community development board to that night, and you might recognize that date.

834
01:24:10,108 --> 01:24:11,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

835
01:24:12,868 --> 01:24:14,669
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to flag that for you.

836
01:24:15,782 --> 01:24:20,123
[SPEAKER_08]: We certainly can meet with the consultants without us, but we have to be at the Community Development Board.

837
01:24:21,063 --> 01:24:23,544
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been scheduled that way since January 1, actually.

838
01:24:24,864 --> 01:24:26,944
[SPEAKER_07]: We published our CD4 calendar.

839
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:29,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

840
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:35,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, to my mind, kind of to wrap up to talk about our next steps for the 26th, totally hear you.

841
01:24:35,766 --> 01:24:37,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's an important conflict.

842
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:59,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what might be additive for Councilors to follow up with the consultant about ahead of our next meeting is if Councilors feel moved to kind of further embellish the priorities that we talked about just now with doing a version of that importance versus urgency matrix that Paola showed earlier.

843
01:25:01,691 --> 01:25:04,533
[SPEAKER_04]: If that hasn't already, you know, if there's anything that city staff have to

844
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:15,485
[SPEAKER_04]: care to add along those lines, especially since you won't be present at our next committee meeting or actually scratch that last part because this is going to be completed by that committee meeting anyway.

845
01:25:15,505 --> 01:25:16,306
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just be reviewing it.

846
01:25:17,046 --> 01:25:27,894
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that making sure that all of those, all of those thoughts, you know, are kind of on the record ahead of our next meeting in terms of what's our priority and also what's a priority because it really needs to be done sooner rather than later.

847
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,595
[SPEAKER_04]: President Bears.

848
01:25:29,615 --> 01:25:35,179
[SPEAKER_02]: We could potentially do an hour on Tuesday night

849
01:25:35,879 --> 01:25:45,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And meeting on Wednesday night, if you guys, I know that, I know, cause I said it wrong last night, you're on the 26th and the 27th are the CD and ZBA.

850
01:25:46,544 --> 01:25:53,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I think right now we have six to seven on the 25th before our regular meeting, if we, so maybe we can just consider that over the next two weeks.

851
01:25:54,087 --> 01:26:00,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't wanna, it's obviously up to everybody being available at that time, but in our council schedule, it is available.

852
01:26:02,927 --> 01:26:03,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that suggestion.

853
01:26:03,828 --> 01:26:13,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually thinking along similar lines earlier, and I know this committee meets a lot, but we're doing some of the most substantive work that the council is gonna do this year.

854
01:26:14,018 --> 01:26:24,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that can help move the ball forward to a place that we're all comfortable with, that sets us up with the information and context that they need to have a really ideally functional work plan for us, I think it's time well spent.

855
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:33,361
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can work on that over the next week to make sure, you know, to assess how valuable that would be and make sure that people would be free at that time.

856
01:26:35,101 --> 01:26:43,723
[SPEAKER_04]: But until then, you know, Paola, if it's possible, if you could, I think I have the, you know, importance versus urgency matrix from the memo that you sent over.

857
01:26:43,743 --> 01:26:53,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I could circulate that to committee members with the invitation to fill that out.

858
01:26:54,687 --> 01:27:09,178
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, within the next week, through me, I could send that back to you as some additional context for building out the work plan, just to make sure that, you know, again, all of those strongly held opinions about importance and urgency are on the record when we put forward this work plan.

859
01:27:09,778 --> 01:27:23,849
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking forward to having the completed mapping analysis to review on June 26th, and then we can also make sure that the spreadsheet of

860
01:27:25,911 --> 01:27:32,014
[SPEAKER_04]: recommended zoning changes pulled from the cap and the comp plan is updated along the lines that we discussed at the beginning of the meeting.

861
01:27:33,094 --> 01:27:39,157
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, adjusting that template so that it looks a little bit more similar to the implementation matrix that we're used to from the cap.

862
01:27:40,397 --> 01:27:44,559
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, kind of having it flow from global to strategy so that they're not in the same column.

863
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:53,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Having it sortable by district based strategy versus global strategy versus strategies that could apply in either case.

864
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:00,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

865
01:28:01,171 --> 01:28:02,431
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds perfect.

866
01:28:04,052 --> 01:28:04,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

867
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:05,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

868
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:09,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be in contact to make sure that you have all the information from this meeting that you need to move forward with all that.

869
01:28:16,799 --> 01:28:19,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Any concluding remarks, questions from members of the committee?

870
01:28:23,563 --> 01:28:24,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Or from city staff?

871
01:28:28,922 --> 01:28:31,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

872
01:28:33,344 --> 01:28:33,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right.

873
01:28:35,104 --> 01:28:36,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

874
01:28:36,525 --> 01:28:38,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe I just won't second then.

875
01:28:39,025 --> 01:28:40,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I just won't second.

876
01:28:40,266 --> 01:28:41,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, second.

877
01:28:42,887 --> 01:28:43,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I second.

878
01:28:43,347 --> 01:28:44,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Vice President Collins.

879
01:28:44,888 --> 01:28:45,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk.

880
01:28:46,288 --> 01:28:47,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, oh, oh, really?

881
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:47,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

882
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:48,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

883
01:28:48,409 --> 01:28:49,269
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

884
01:28:49,629 --> 01:28:49,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

885
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:50,569
[SPEAKER_04]: All those against.

886
01:28:50,589 --> 01:28:51,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting is adjourned.

887
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:53,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Paola and Jimmy.

888
01:28:53,971 --> 01:28:54,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

889
01:28:55,591 --> 01:28:56,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

890
01:28:56,752 --> 01:28:57,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

891
01:28:58,720 --> 01:28:59,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I just forgot.
