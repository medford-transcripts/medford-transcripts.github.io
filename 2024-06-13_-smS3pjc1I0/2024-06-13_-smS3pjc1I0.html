    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=0.06s">Let's</a>  call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2.061s">President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2.882s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3.783s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4.543s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5.144s">Councilwoman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5.944s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=6.685s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=7.886s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli is absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=10.487s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=11.828s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=13.93s">Four</a>  present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=16.171s">The</a>  meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=18.873s">At</a>  this meeting, we will again revisit paper <a href="../resolutions/24-033.pdf"><font color="green">24-033</font></a>, offered by President Bears and Vice President Collins, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=32.857s">The</a>  agenda says this is the fourth Zoning Updates meeting with Innes Associates, but I think the actual number is higher than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=38.959s">For</a>  this meeting, we have agreed on the following agenda, to look at priority zoning recommendations from the Climate Adaptation and Action Plan, to prioritize zoning recommendations from the 2023 Comprehensive Plan, discussing completing the mapping analysis by June 30, and to discuss new topics that came up during the May 8 committee meeting that should be added to our work plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=61.475s">including</a>  legal definitions and formatting and permitting and process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=70.284s">Given</a>  that, that's a lot to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=72.506s">I</a>  know that NS Associates has prepared a memo with a first draft of pulling those zoning recommendations from the comp plan and the climate adaptation and action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=82.195s">So</a>  there's a lot to potentially go over in that already. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=87.446s">speaking</a>  as one councilor, speaking as the chair, I think my ideal goals for this meeting are to do an overview of the existing recommendations that Innes Associates has already pulled from the cap and the comp plan, to have a discussion on that with councilors towards the goal of at our next committee meeting on June 26, making sure that councilors, Innis and staff all feel comfortable that all of the recommendations that should be pulled from the climate action and adaptation plan and the comp plan <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=117.145s">have</a>  been fully culled, they're all in our work plan, and that we've also talked about assigning priority levels to those zoning recommendations so that we can enter into the new fiscal year feeling like our source documents have been properly vetted and that way we can just approach things by topic and by neighborhood from there on out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=136.691s">I'd</a>  also love for us to have a discussion about kind of how we can <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=142.179s">codifying,</a>  putting legal definitions in format, permitting and process into the work timeline to make sure that gets baked in, and then discussing what we need to do to make sure that the mapping analysis, which I think is in a draft stage, will be completed and ready for review at the June 26th committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=160.815s">Before</a>  we get started with reviewing, I want to pass it off to NS Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=165.94s">Any</a>  preliminary comments from Councilors?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=173.911s">The</a>  only thing, and maybe we can talk about it more on the 26th, that I think would be good to at least start talking about is the, and it's kind of in here as the new topics, but the work plan, kind of the two tracks of the work plan that we talked about recently, where we'd have kind of the global citywide <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=197.97s">changes</a>  on one track and then changes that are going to require different local neighborhood discussions or essentially the district by district and neighborhood type changes on another track and hopefully kind of try to have that out there well in advance so the residents can be informed and know when we're going to be talking about their neighborhood as it relates to the comp plan and all the other changes we want to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=227.216s">just</a>  that I think maybe we can take that to the 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=229.516s">Maybe</a>  it's like a natural next step from this final topic here on our agenda today.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=235.498s">Thank</a>  you, president bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=236.418s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=237.338s">I</a>  think it'd be great to publish that well in advance so that residents have lots of lead time to know when changes that might affect their neighborhood are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=244.94s">Um,</a>  and I think it would be a great segue to, I think it could be a great segue to complete this categorization <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=252.875s">pulling</a>  from the cap and the comp plan and making sure that we've been thorough and comprehensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=257.879s">It</a>  seems to me that we might be able to solidify the work plan for the global and the district changes once we kind of have the full scope of what we're looking at and how those might file in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=270.009s">Any</a>  preliminary comments from city staff before I turn it over to Ines Associates? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=280.197s">Well,</a>  I'll turn it over to Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=282.799s">And,</a>  um, I was thinking open to alternative ideas on this, but knowing that we have, uh, reviewing the, um, the memo that was circulated to Councilors last week with that draft of, uh, Zona recommendations pulled from the cap and the comp plan, um, there's quite a lot to discuss in there so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=303.37s">And</a>  I think that we'd probably all appreciate adjourning no later than eight 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=307.256s">So</a>  to me, I think that our time could be best served doing kind of a general overview, not going through things necessarily in great detail line by line. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=316.001s">But</a>  I know that my priority is making sure that everything that ought to be on that list is and working on assigning a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=324.206s">So</a>  if we could kind of do a high level overview of what's currently in that memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=329.798s">Paola,</a>  and if you could speak to, you know, if there's anything that you particularly think ought to be flagged, anything that didn't make it in, and why I think that that might be most helpful for starting us out.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=342.203s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=343.204s">Good</a>  afternoon, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=344.504s">This</a>  is Paola from Menace Associates, representing Emily, the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=351.747s">And</a>  with me is the GIS expert, Jim Irosha, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=358.693s">Um,</a>  so yes, I think that what I was. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=363.597s">Actually,</a>  what I wanted to do was going really explaining what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=367.08s">Um,</a>  and then ask if there are any, uh, comments or things that you didn't see that you would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=375.127s">So</a>  get more of the feedback from you instead of reading one by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=379.43s">Um,</a>  so I'm going to share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=383.253s">So</a>  we can see it maybe a bit better.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=385.475s">I</a>  think the plan sounds great.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=387.277s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=390.841s">Here</a>  we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=398.585s">Yeah,</a>  so as you said, the agenda is about the SONY recommendations from the Climate Adaptation Action Plan and the recommendations from the 2023 Comprehensive Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=410.691s">At</a>  the moment, we have a list with all of them, each in one table. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=418.673s">And</a>  actually, what I wanted to do today was more to get your feedback on how we do the prioritization. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=427.697s">So</a>  we have an idea and a method, and that's mainly what we wanted to run by you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=434.0s">But</a>  we can go step by step. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=437.362s">And</a>  so that we all agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=442.465s">So</a>  first, the first <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=447.369s">topic</a>  that we treat was the climate resilience. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=450.95s">And</a>  we took it from in the in the table, you are going to have the number and the number is exactly the number that is, it's taken by the by the CAP, the Climate Adaptation Action Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=464.895s">So</a>  you see the number, we have the big goals first, and in bold, and then after that, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=474.571s">you</a>  will see the recommendations that are more specific to this first goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=481.377s">So</a>  for example, we have diverse and affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=484.84s">We</a>  explain what it entails. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=488.623s">And</a>  then we have the three sub strategies that comes with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=498.372s">You</a>  will see the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=500.405s">In</a>  this cap, we only use the climate resiliency, but actually, there are more topics that are influenced directly by this, and we will see it later, that we will use to create, to prioritize these strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=517.329s">Where</a>  does it come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=518.389s">So</a>  in this case, it's the cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=520.649s">And</a>  then after, so the next weeks we want to, as Zach Barrett said, we want to work on the work plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=529.639s">That's</a>  why we today wanted to work on the priority, because it will help us to go through the work plan and so that every of these strategies can be more specific to which phase are going to be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=543.89s">In</a>  this, in the first table, you will see inside the strategies, these like B51. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=552.336s">This</a>  comes from the zoning memorandum that we've been working. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=556.092s">And</a>  these are the strategies and suggestions that came from the Department of Planning and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=563.861s">And</a>  so what we did is include these ones in exactly the strategy from the CAB that we thought were more appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=573.692s">So,</a>  for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=576.061s">In</a>  this case, the B51 overlay district that has a lot of different suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=582.204s">The</a>  density zone was applied to this strategy, the BE11B. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=591.029s">And</a>  you can see that all the way we have the BE12, high-performance new buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=596.592s">This</a>  comes from the CAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=598.813s">And</a>  then from the department, the suggestions about the eco-roof ordinance, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=603.672s">is</a>  in here, or the B49 by right allowances is in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=608.253s">So</a>  we tried to not have a lot of different tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=611.494s">We</a>  wanted to have one in this case that took all the climate resiliency suggestions into one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=618.675s">And</a>  that's why you will see these bold numbers B51, B52, B47 in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=624.016s">This</a>  is for the climate resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=634.853s">And</a>  then if I go a bit further, we will see the list of objectives and actions typed in changes, but this comes from the comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=649.044s">So</a>  in here, we did the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=650.325s">We</a>  have the number of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=651.827s">The</a>  main one, it's in bold. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=655.269s">And</a>  then the more specific are later on in normal letters, not usable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=664.285s">Then</a>  we have the topics, the main ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=667.387s">Obviously,</a>  as the other ones, sometimes we have several because it's not only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=672.069s">These</a>  usually overlap and usually almost always overlap with different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=677.712s">But</a>  here we try to do the main ones that affect these strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=686.203s">In</a>  here, this table is only for the comp plan, so that for now it's easier to see and not to have them all together and overlap. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=698.091s">And</a>  yeah, it's exactly the same as the other one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=700.693s">We</a>  have the number, the specification, so the description of the strategy, the topics that are treated and the origin, and we will work on the phase and the priority <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=716.787s">the</a>  26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=720.57s">So</a>  what I was expecting is that if you have any doubts or if you have any comments on this, that we will love to hear about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=733.437s">What</a>  I want to show you is, and maybe we can do this after, what we have prepared is also how to treat priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=742.402s">And</a>  so what we can do is that I stop here at the moment <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=745.765s">we</a>  can see if there are any doubts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=747.887s">If</a>  you want me to read one by one, I can totally do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=752.03s">Or</a>  if there is any specific that you want to tell me about, we can go to those specific strategies.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=767.54s">I'll</a>  go first to President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=768.921s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=770.482s">And</a>  I just had one, I think this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=772.563s">I</a>  just had one quick change from the Climate Adaptation Action Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=778.587s">I</a>  just think that BE 1.1 should probably be like an HP or maybe HPHA instead of in CR, but the rest of that did seem to be climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=790.015s">At</a>  least that's how I read BE 1.1.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=795.086s">Oh,</a>  this one's yeah, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=798.248s">So</a>  this will come also later, because it does affect climate resiliency in because you have more, maybe it's the density, change densities, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=810.093s">So</a>  it has different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=811.514s">And</a>  it's, they are very intertwined, it's difficult to take one without the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=819.298s">And</a>  so this is what we are going to use later for the prioritizing the <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=824.858s">The</a>  strategies affect different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=827.399s">The</a>  more they affect, the more impact they are going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=830.68s">And</a>  that is a way of prioritizing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=834.121s">But</a>  so what I can do and what I wanted to do is to add also main topics that also are affected by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=841.983s">So</a>  I totally agree that this one should be H-A-C-R so that we have both in them.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=848.846s">Yeah,</a>  and I think H-P as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=850.426s">But</a>  I hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=851.306s">I</a>  think adding to the list makes sense.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=856.789s">You</a>  will see later what I mean.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=860.371s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=861.232s">The</a>  rest of the CAAP, you know, recommendations seem pretty solidly in the climate resiliency bucket to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=874.44s">Well,</a>  now we get back down to the accessible neighborhoods and maybe I'm, yeah, I can see something that could have some overlap there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=881.244s">But</a>  I like the idea of going through, I don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=885.126s">Maybe,</a>  maybe we could go through the bolded ones like the, with just the one point, you know, without the sub letters and maybe we could prioritize those first.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=896.294s">Yeah,</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=897.835s">So</a>  I can go now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=898.975s">Do</a>  you want me to go now?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=900.957s">Great,</a>  Paula. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=901.457s">Yeah,</a>  just to jump in quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=902.778s">I</a>  think that's a great place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=905.8s">And</a>  as I'm looking through this, you know, I think my priorities for the 26th is, and if we, if there's a way to <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=913.547s">have</a>  this reflected in the updated table, if we can kind of be in a process of over the next two weeks, kind of as much as possible, disaggregating the zoning goals with the specific zoning strategies, or replacing some of the goals with specific strategies to achieve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=931.815s">I</a>  think how you have it laid out for today is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=933.836s">And</a>  I hope that, you know, through our discussion and revision over the next couple of weeks, it can be, you know, kind of more like left column, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=940.925s">goal</a>  that this recommendation is pointing to, column next to that, here are the specific zoning changes that would get us closer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=947.929s">And</a>  I believe the bolded headings right now are, for the most part, the goals that have specific strategies attached to them at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=959.815s">Should</a>  we start there? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=960.735s">And</a>  Paolo, was it your intention that we would kind of start there and we could also be talking about prioritization as we're going through those strategies? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=970.523s">Director</a>  Hunt, I want to recognize you if you had a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=972.845s">I</a>  might have missed your hand.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=977.528s">I'm</a>  having a little trouble following some of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=985.473s">And</a>  some of it is, I just want to, for anybody who's following who is lost, the key for the topics is at the very bottom of the chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=993.058s">So</a>  this is all, if anybody is watching, this attachment that we're looking at is, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=999.523s">in</a>  the handouts for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1002.224s">But</a>  the key that tells you what CRHPHA are is in the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1007.647s">But</a>  there isn't actually a key to the letters on the left in the left-hand column. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1017.452s">And</a>  I am having trouble remembering what all of these things stand for, because they're not ringing a bell from either the climate plan or the <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1027.799s">comprehensive</a>  plan, the WSVP in the left-hand column. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1032.903s">So</a>  that was a little bit confusing, and I just wanna make sure, it seemed to me, I was trying to follow, some of these are goals, these are not things that we're gonna do, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1044.593s">We're</a>  going to try to achieve them, and many of them are actions, and it wasn't actually clear to me that only the things that are bold are goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1059.139s">And</a>  so some of these things, like how do we properly separate some of these?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1068.243s">Yeah,</a>  thank you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1069.804s">I</a>  know, I think that's, you more eloquently put the point I was trying to make just now, which is right now we have the goals and some strategies to achieve them in the same column. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1078.308s">I</a>  think that's totally fine for a first draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1080.322s">But</a>  I think that it's important for the, you know, comprehensive and updated version that we look at in a couple weeks that we separate the actual strategy that's being recommended of this body from what's the point of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1093.155s">Why</a>  are we doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1094.176s">What</a>  goal does it relate to? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1095.237s">And</a>  what topic does that goal fit within? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1098.641s">Maybe</a>  it's a matter of just a column getting added if we have number <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1103.544s">Sarah</a>  Silver, PB): Goal and then recommended zoning related action or something along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1107.89s">But</a>  right now, I think it's confusing to have goals and strategies aggregated together.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1111.435s">Sarah</a>  Silver, PB): Right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1112.076s">And</a>  I think part of it is, for example, under be the very beginning is a great example though that diverse and affordable housing housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1119.266s">It's</a>  like a title. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1120.575s">But</a>  actually 1.1a, reduce zoning barriers to multifamily and mixed-use housing development is the thing I think we're gonna do throughout this entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1130.198s">And</a>  enables, although enables small and more diverse housing options through zoning updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1135.619s">Like</a>  we're doing the zoning updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1137.78s">We</a>  wanna keep that in mind as we do this, that those are some of our goals of the entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1144.722s">And</a>  I see that one recommendation is to create an overlay district. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1148.906s">Whereas</a>  there are other things in here that are seeing much more actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1155.531s">And</a>  that maybe we need a separate list of like, what are our high level goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1159.495s">That</a>  is just a separate table. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1160.796s">These</a>  are our high level goals that you could keep referring back to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1164.338s">And</a>  here are things that we're going to do throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1167.081s">And</a>  a little bit of it is because I'm anxious to actually getting to changing <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1173.143s">talking</a>  about actually in this district, what in this area, what do we want the borders to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1178.165s">And</a>  what do we want the dimensions to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1180.505s">And</a>  what do we want to add for performance standards?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1183.646s">So,</a>  yeah, 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1184.687s">And</a>  I think that I'm feeling similarly, you know, I think it's this is necessary runway up to getting to the point where we're taking votes on strategies that get us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1193.289s">But</a>  we're here to take votes on the strategies that will allow us to actually to actually reduce the zoning barriers to multifamily and mixed use housing development, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1203.17s">Um,</a>  so, you know, just to restate as one Councilor, my priority is to make sure that every, every, every strategy that has been put into the cap and the comp plan so far as a change that we could vote on and make that would achieve these goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1218.7s">I</a>  want to make sure that that's in this table or an updated version of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1222.262s">Um,</a>  so that, you know, at the beginning of July, what we have is a list is essentially a to do list. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1228.84s">Um,</a>  so I think for today, you know, I think all of this aligns with what you were talking about is making sure that discussing what's here, if there's any flags that are raised from Councilors are the things that strategies that are in here that are confusing or strategies that aren't in here that we think should be, um, and to work on, you know, assigning perhaps a priority level to the strategies that are already inside as a bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1255.359s">Yeah,</a>  I think it might also be useful to both of your points to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1260.821s">I</a>  mean, I think we can do what you just said and kind of go through this and put some general priorities down, but I think it might actually be useful to, instead of have like almost a turn the table, like instead of having the numbers and headers from the plans be like the defining column, but to have the topics be the column, and then we could split it out into goals and actions <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1283.188s">grouped</a>  within the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1284.328s">I</a>  mean, I think we're kind of doing it just as like, if this was a spreadsheet, I would just move a column and then sort it differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1290.27s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1290.891s">Um,</a>  so, and I think it might, like, it might be useful for us to take, like, I generally think that most of the things in bold here are goal statements and most of the sub headers are like different <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1304.756s">possible</a>  actions that could happen within each topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1308.46s">I</a>  think it might be useful for us to have a table, like take the goals that are under each topic and kind of come up with what you just said, Alicia, like a general goal statement for each topic area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1318.811s">I</a>  think these are a great starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1321.574s">We</a>  probably would <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1323.584s">narrow</a>  them down a little bit so we don't have like a nine bullet point kind of necessarily goal statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1330.151s">And</a>  then have the specific recommended strategies in there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1337.119s">And</a>  then I think the other piece of this, like to Alicia's point, like I think there's two things we can do here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1341.344s">Like</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1344.162s">One</a>  is, there's one track of this that's like, we want to look at all of our district and our map, and we want to talk about what uses we want and what places, what dimensional requirements we want in which places, and essentially what we want neighborhoods, corridors, and squares to look like across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1364.51s">And</a>  then there's what are things that we want to be <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1369.181s">happening</a>  in all of those districts for all of the new construction, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1373.084s">Like</a>  we, like some of the, um, climate resiliency type stuff, like we're going to want new construction generally. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1379.608s">And</a>  maybe it's not in all of them because I don't, I don't know how the building code interacts with quite frankly, that's a piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1386.612s">I</a>  have a lot less, uh, understanding of, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1392.116s">general</a>  guidelines that we would want to apply to the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1397.098s">And</a>  to me, it's, um, it's the climate resiliency and the housing affordability and the, to an extent, the economic development and business growth and the transportation and multimodal ways like those seem to me to be more like we want complete streets everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1414.864s">We</a>  want net zero construction everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1417.244s">We</a>  want, um, you know, more housing affordability everywhere we want <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1422.478s">more</a>  business growth in all parts of the city and what are policies that can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1426.639s">And</a>  then that's one track of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1428.339s">Then</a>  there's a track of things that is, this is kind of the specific like form, um, of, you know, the shape and size of structures and the vision of lots and like what, um, and the heights and densities in different parts of the city, um, and redrawing the boundaries and barriers of, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1450.367s">of</a>  the zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1451.568s">So,</a>  um, that just to me, I think is a good, a way that I could think about this a little more clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1459.435s">And</a>  I think to like, just taking that, maybe taking these, all of these topics and putting them into those two buckets and then taking kind of resorting this, um, list of recommendations from the climate and comprehensive plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1476.823s">to</a>  have be like shorter tables under each topic area could be a way of organizing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1482.728s">Um,</a>  but I also think we could go through today and at least talk about prioritizing some of these, but again, it, yeah, like I, my top priority is reducing zoning barriers to multifamily and mixed use housing development. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1500.763s">And</a>  then also probably something in the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1507.025s">you</a>  know, not necessarily undertaking corridor and commercial center studies, but allowing an appropriate mix of uses and land controls for cohesive development along corridors and within squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1515.692s">Like</a>  those are my two big ones.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1518.414s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1519.635s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1520.275s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1520.435s">And</a>  I think I would co-sign those priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1524.018s">Um,</a>  but in terms of our strategy for today, um, you know, I think we're all eager to get, put some, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1533.865s">to</a>  successfully get through the part of the process we're figuring out how to fit these goals on the page in a way that makes our work easier so that we can proceed along to the point where we're actually discussing the material changes that are being recommended to achieve the goals that are being articulated in the updated version of the spreadsheet or any others. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1553.579s">And</a>  it made me think about the flowchart or spreadsheet that's in the implementation section of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan itself, which <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1562.941s">always</a>  stuck with me because I found it so readable and useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1568.104s">And</a>  maybe I think what we're talking about is like a one step more granular version of that, where right now, like that has... I think that's exactly what I was just looking at.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1579.85s">That's</a>  why I laughed.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1581.25s">Yeah,</a>  no, I mean, that's what's been sticking in my brain because that implementation matrix is so useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1585.593s">I</a>  can bring it up if you give me a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1588.494s">There's</a>  an implementation matrix at the back of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1594.564s">I</a>  can bring that up unless somebody has it at their fingertips.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1596.605s">But</a>  I think like, if I might, when the air blows, you have to project more because it's hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1602.028s">It's</a>  the white noise is making it hard to hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1604.329s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1605.209s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1605.649s">And</a>  I guarantee I am trying as hard as I possibly can.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1611.192s">It's</a>  the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1611.912s">It's</a>  not you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1612.712s">I</a>  know.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1613.893s">That's</a>  why it's so frustrating.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1616.174s">It's</a>  a little box up there, a little cardboard box. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1622.297s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1625.779s">We're</a>  going to make a supplemental appropriation for a little Barbie mic for me so that people can hear me for the first time ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1632.863s">Hang</a>  on one sec. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1633.463s">I'm</a>  going to pull up the CAP plan.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1648.971s">I</a>  have here the topics in this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1655.323s">Alicia,</a>  the BE and all this EN that you're seeing there, it's over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1663.727s">These</a>  are the main goals from the CAP and the main goals from the COMP plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1668.209s">I</a>  have it here because I wanted to use this so that you can help me or I can get your feedback on the importance and rating these big goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1680.342s">Yeah,</a>  sorry for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1682.043s">We</a>  tried to simplify it as much as possible to just get the priorities first. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1690.566s">But</a>  I agree that there is still a lot of work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1695.028s">This</a>  is a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1697.549s">And</a>  so we also want to group all these strategies in the sections of the zoning that needs to be changed so that we only do these things once. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1709.389s">So</a>  all the strategies that, for example, are talking about changing dimensions and uses or that are about standards, to group them so that we know that, OK, let's change the dimensions in order to achieve these goals and all these strategies, and so that we pass only once and we don't have to do that many times going from goal to goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1738.564s">So</a>  there are a lot of ways and different ways to continue to explore this and group to make it as easy as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1746.409s">And</a>  so, yes, I agree with all your suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1751.032s">We</a>  can separate goals and then do another column for the specific strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1756.576s">We</a>  will add also the part of the zoning that needs to be changed and altered in order to achieve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1762.66s">So</a>  we all have, okay, this is about the dimensions, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1767.099s">the</a>  standards on these on mixed use or in this district, and so that we have all those also. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1775.842s">But</a>  I didn't want to bring a lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1778.523s">It's</a>  already a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1780.124s">And</a>  I really wanted to focus on having this kind of rating so we can prioritize a bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1788.247s">But</a>  totally, I agree with everything you've said.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1791.188s">Thank</a>  you, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1793.749s">I</a>  really appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1796.38s">this</a>  is really helpful, this table.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1800.226s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1801.448s">No,</a>  I think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1803.352s">Just</a>  since we're talking about it really quickly, I'm going to share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1813.246s">So</a>  this is not as useful as I thought it would be because the version of the cap that's on the city website has the way that two page view works is it's just flipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1821.872s">So</a>  what's on the left should be on the right, but I think this gives an idea at least of, you know, this kind of stepping down towards granularity. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1834.441s">What's</a>  the word I'm looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1836.823s">Visual</a>  layout that we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1838.72s">or</a>  at least that I'm kind of thinking of, of starting with the goal and then saying within this, you know, and maybe what I mean by making this more granular is instead of here having strategy and action is having, you know, replacing that action with the specific zoning change that's recommended to achieve that goal or that strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1859.774s">So</a>  just, I just wanted to provide a visual guide for what I was, what we were describing earlier since we were talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1866.359s">And</a>  again, sorry that this page is <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1868.962s">flipped,</a>  but I think this gives you a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1871.424s">Another</a>  thing that I like about this, just in terms of a template, I think it's helpful to have a snapshot of a timeline over which, as we get into strategies that will require more research, more neighborhood meetings, I think it would be great to have a snapshot of the time that we might need to take on those strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1898.948s">and</a>  like other benchmarks kind of in the same spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1904.733s">And</a>  Paola, you mentioned that maybe for next time as we pursue all the updates that we've discussed so far in the updated version of the spreadsheet, I think it would be great to have a link to where specifically in the zoning that update or addition might occur as we get into specific strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1926.13s">I</a>  think that that would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1928.191s">And</a>  I really appreciate you, you know, trying to pace us into this and I speaking for probably not only myself, I know that we're all really eager to get through the phase of visioning and talking about strategies and getting into the nitty gritty. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1941.556s">So</a>  thank you for not throwing us into the deep end, but as one Councilor, I'm eager to be thrown into the deep end. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1948.999s">Should</a>  we return to kind of a conversation of prioritization at this point, I'll make sure at the end that we're kind of all clear on <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1955.546s">the</a>  updates to the spreadsheet that we wanna see for next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1959.447s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1960.267s">Could</a>  we take a look at the kind of more simplified tables that Paula just said? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1964.888s">Yeah,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1965.688s">Because</a>  I think it might be better to like go through those than to go through each of the, I think that sounds like what you were saying, Paula, if I heard you right.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1975.671s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1977.211s">So</a>  our idea today was to have this exercise of <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1982.541s">These</a>  are the topics, the big goals from the CAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1984.963s">These</a>  are the big goals from the COMP plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1988.086s">Associated</a>  with this, we also included the different topics that are related to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1994.731s">And</a>  this comes, as you said, Alicia, at the end of the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2005.66s">Because</a>  if we start writing all this HA, housing affordability, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2011.36s">house</a>  production, economic development, it just, it gets too messy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2016.524s">So</a>  that's why this is so helpful, but it is in the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2021.287s">And</a>  then what I wanted to show you is how we would do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2026.711s">So</a>  it's to prioritize it's at some point, it gets very subjective. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2033.275s">And</a>  what we wanted is to make it as subjective as possible and to work with <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2040.211s">how</a>  much impact this strategy has and to somehow have a number or give a number to that, how impacted it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2053.48s">We</a>  developed this like three questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2056.002s">The</a>  first one is, do this strategy appears in both plans or only in one? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2062.186s">That</a>  is the first question that we make. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2064.428s">And</a>  so, for example, you see here the B1, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2068.44s">and</a>  the WS11 that are very similar in their intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2076.942s">And</a>  so we know that these will appear in both. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2080.403s">It's</a>  kind of important if it has some kind of overlap, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2084.484s">And</a>  then we have, the second question is how many topics are involved in these two, in these strategies? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2093.746s">And</a>  so we have, for example, here under we have <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2096.854s">Well,</a>  this one will talk about affordability, production, economic development, climate resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2103.695s">And</a>  also, it's directly, but a bit less than the others or less influence than the others, will be the corridors and the uses and districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2115.597s">So</a>  they are also there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2116.618s">So</a>  we know that these have a huge impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2120.358s">And</a>  then the third question that we ask is, is it <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2125.103s">a</a>  strategy that should be applied in the whole city, or is it a strategy that is applied only to certain areas, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2131.927s">And</a>  so that is like the third thing that we look in order to rate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2136.39s">And</a>  so, for example, this BE11, it's rated as an importance of five. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2144.335s">All</a>  these strategies are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2146.738s">and</a>  that we are rating it a bit less, it doesn't mean that we're not going to make them or that we're not going to care about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2153.842s">It's</a>  just to help us to create this work plan and to focus on very big and important and the efforts where we wanted to place them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2163.267s">But</a>  it doesn't mean that we are not going to worry about others that will have a less kind of importance rate that I wanted to make very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2172.848s">For</a>  example, we have this another example, and this is the high heat mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2178.391s">It</a>  is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2181.012s">It</a>  appears in both plans, but it's so specific that it only affects climate resiliency directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2188.776s">Indirectly,</a>  it affects many things, but let's say directly only that topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2193.759s">And</a>  so because it's that specific, we have it as an importance of two. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2198.973s">And</a>  so this is a bit of how we will do this with these strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2206.615s">And</a>  these were only some examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2209.455s">And</a>  so what we wanted for me today is having this in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2214.816s">We</a>  would like to go through all these topics and if we could rate them, if you could rate them and give us the feedback, which ones do you really think that are five or <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2229.208s">three</a>  or one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2230.088s">I</a>  don't need all the numbers, but something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2234.569s">Um,</a>  we have prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2237.87s">This</a>  board so that and Jimmy is there to help me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2242.91s">Um</a>  so that we have here all the big goals and that Jimmy will help me to assign each color is for one of the Councilors or city members and to start <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2259.213s">putting</a>  these post-its on the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 rating, if there's something that you would like to test. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2269.6s">So</a>  while we talk and discuss, Jimmy is in the background doing this, so then we can take it home with all your opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2277.324s">Is</a>  there something that you would like to do, or do you want to have a bit more time to process this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2284.609s">Let</a>  me know.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2287.094s">Before</a>  I recognize President Bears, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2289.556s">I</a>  think this is a very creative way to do this exercise. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2292.678s">Just</a>  my first instinct is I'm kind of of two minds on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2297.342s">I</a>  think this is an exercise we could do synchronously. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2299.544s">I</a>  think this is something that Councilors could do asynchronously as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2309.815s">I</a>  think that there also could be value in kind of going through a row and discussing that to kind of make sure that we're aligned on rating systems and then making sure that additional feedback is sent back to Innocence City staff on a reasonable timeline over the next week, perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2328.467s">In</a>  any case, I do just want to acknowledge that we also want to talk about the status of the mapping analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2336.032s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2338.328s">tonight</a>  and it's 7.45. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2339.269s">So</a>  if we are going to have a conversation about prioritization, I just think that we should probably try to keep that to no more than 30 minutes to make sure that we get through the rest of our agenda and have time to get solid on our plan for June 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2352.456s">I'm</a>  sorry, Councilor Leming, you are next and then President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2357.378s">Thank</a>  you, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2358.919s">I</a>  do appreciate the energy that has clearly been put into breaking down a very <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2366.795s">complicated</a>  set of topics down and simplifying it for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2374.357s">I</a>  would personally be of the mind that I do want to engage in the rating exercise, but I fully agree that it can be done offline. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2385.059s">And</a>  perhaps there could be a motion to do that before the next meeting, before this has ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2391.02s">What</a>  I would like to ask you is in terms of these <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2396.141s">general</a>  topics that you've seen from the comprehensive plan and the cap plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2400.244s">And</a>  I do understand that there are certain things that are very broad and there's certain things, like you said, the heating that were very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2409.11s">What</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2410.515s">very,</a>  and it's going to be very difficult for y'all to come up with something that can integrate all of the themes from both of these into one comprehensive zoning plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2423.619s">What,</a>  from your impressions, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2428.789s">could</a>  there really be, do you really see there being like contradictions when you're actually trying to implement these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2437.457s">So</a>  if, you know, there is, could be, you know, there could be a need for better transportation, there could be a need for more affordable housing, there could be a need to <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2453.112s">make</a>  buildings more energy efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2456.074s">Do</a>  you see any of these things in a single zoning plan strongly contradicting each other when you really get down to the nitty gritty? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2468.323s">I'd</a>  like to hear your general thoughts on that.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2472.706s">So</a>  to be honest, no, I think that this is very well done. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2476.009s">The</a>  CAP and the COMP plan are very well done plans <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2480.902s">And</a>  I think that these things actually help each other, so that when you actually do one goal, you're actually helping the others to also be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2491.927s">So</a>  maybe when you go to the very specific, we would have some contradictions, but I expect very minor things, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2501.721s">I</a>  think that this all works towards the same direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2505.223s">And</a>  that's what I see from the cap, from the comp plan and both together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2509.645s">There</a>  is a lot of overlap because they have the very similar goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2516.529s">So</a>  at the moment, nothing has popped up that to me saying this really, this goes really both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2525.934s">No,</a>  I think that is everything that I've seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2529.116s">To</a>  be honest, it's been on the same <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2532.167s">and</a>  I think it's a very good path.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2534.068s">Okay,</a>  so when we're rating things, it's not like we're saying you should do this instead of this.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2541.212s">No,</a>  no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2543.214s">We</a>  just want to use this to make the working plan and to help us a bit to do this strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2553.519s">And</a>  also it doesn't mean that when some of the strategies can be, let's imagine that one of the strategies is lower <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2562.065s">It</a>  doesn't mean that we're not going to do it or that we're going to leave it at the end, because sometimes things need to go in packs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2568.766s">And</a>  so we can have a very high priority, medium priority, and low priority going all in one package together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2577.068s">It's</a>  just to help us understand, to make a strategy of how to work this, and to really put our time where we all agree that is needed from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2592.683s">But</a>  it's only about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2594.004s">It</a>  doesn't mean that we don't think it's important or that we don't think that we should do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2599.748s">I</a>  think that all of the things that are here and that are on the plan on the tables, I think are great and all of them should be done.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2611.135s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2611.575s">And</a>  if I could just jump in and then I'll recognize you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2616.978s">I</a>  think that because the goals and topics that we're talking about are <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2622.284s">In</a>  one sense, they're things that we're constantly talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2624.326s">I</a>  think, you know, for many of us, that's why we're in office, because we want these goals to be achieved. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2628.769s">And</a>  I think we're all completely aligned that these are, all of these are high priority in terms of creating a prioritization system that will help NS Associates, you know, know in what orders we present things to us and to city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2645.388s">The</a>  more I think about it, I think it could be a productive thing for us to do in between committee meetings, perhaps over the next week so that NS has enough time to digest it before our next committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2654.394s">But</a>  I think, you know, for myself, one way I might approach this in terms of what would I really want to be high on the priority list would be either things that are most achievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2663.544s">Let's</a>  get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2665.084s">I</a>  think that Councilors might have, you know, we could look at priorities at the topic level or just at the specific strategy level. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2671.566s">And</a>  some topics might be high priority because the strategies that go along with them are high priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2678.287s">But,</a>  you know, knowing that this issue of priority topics is something that we think about, you know, so constantly, I would be inclined to, you know, focus our thinking on, you know, what information and what format is in us, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2692.239s">most</a>  need to be able to, you know, put together a functioning helpful work plan from us so that we can hasten to that part where we're kind of looking at specific zoning strategies and seeing where in the zoning court that lines up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2707.504s">So,</a>  you know, eager to hear other Councilors perspectives on this, but I think it might be productive over the next week if Councilors can, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2715.572s">kind</a>  of do a look back through the topics and the goals that we're thinking about and writing about and emailing constituents about all the time and say, you know, here's my ranking or here are the strategies that I think really have to be in the first three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2730.384s">I</a>  am pretty confident there'll be a lot of alignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2735.468s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2738.691s">I</a>  was following up until the kind of timing element of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2745.987s">Are</a>  you saying that a number would mean a time?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2748.308s">I'm</a>  sorry?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2749.648s">Like</a>  a five would mean three months, a four would mean six months or something like that?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2753.329s">No,</a>  no, no.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2754.53s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2755.99s">No,</a>  I just, I just meant like, as a way for councillors to say, this is what feels most urgent to me.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2762.833s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2763.193s">Yeah,</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2768.134s">Is</a>  the, what is, it's called a Miro page. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2770.895s">Is</a>  that what I saw, Paula?</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2772.936s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2774.232s">Is</a>  that able, like, could that be shared? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2776.073s">Could</a>  we edit that separately? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2777.814s">I</a>  think it would be worth it personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2780.315s">I</a>  mean, I understand that people don't want to do it this way, but I could, I think we could spend five minutes and each of us pick a row and, you know, you guys can pick a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2792.12s">We</a>  can pick a row and we can just move them now and then we don't have to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2795.602s">And</a>  then we can talk about why things are where they are for 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2800.044s">Cause</a>  I just worry if we do it asynchronously, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2804.625s">It's,</a>  there's no collective time for us to interpret it until the next time we want to talk about it, which is when we want it to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2812.327s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2812.627s">So</a>  yeah, I know it's kind of fast, but I feel like I could do it.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2818.889s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2819.069s">And</a>  I think that, you know, kind of by the same token, because this is topics that we're constantly immersed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2825.311s">I</a>  don't think that we need a lot of time to digest these topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2830.112s">So</a>  for us to be doing it.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2832.927s">For</a>  the sharing, it's a bit, it's going to take a bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2840.069s">What</a>  we had in mind was to just go one by one, tell us, and then Jimmy in the background is going to put it in the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2847.371s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2849.612s">So</a>  that if that's okay, if you want to, if we can just go one by one so he can just write it, he will write your name. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2862.461s">And</a>  then for example, the black is the first person that wants to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2867.143s">And</a>  then he will start moving them into the rating system.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2871.684s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2872.024s">Here's</a>  the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2872.985s">We've</a>  been talking for an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2874.425s">This</a>  should take us three hours tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2876.946s">There</a>  is no way that we can do this in a reasonable length of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2880.007s">And</a>  I was a little bit confused whether you wanted us to rank just those high level topics, which we can't, they're all important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2889.43s">To</a>  rank the individual strategies, we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2892.25s">but</a>  that will take us hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2895.313s">And</a>  I, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2896.714s">I</a>  just, I think we, why don't we talk about the other things we wanted to talk about this evening and then see where we are.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2903.14s">I'm</a>  very much on the other side of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2904.481s">I</a>  thought we could take the top level topics.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2908.584s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2908.925s">Well,</a>  I'm not ranking ensure affordable housing for all over, you know, create 12, you know, the economic development one versus the networks one, like,</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2918.911s">Oh,</a>  I felt very comfortable doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2923.854s">It's</a>  not to say that they're not, I think this is about importance in terms of timing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2930.659s">That's</a>  what I'm hearing.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2931.66s">Yeah,</a>  if I could step us back for a second, Paola, could you recenter us on what, from your perspective for your work plan after tonight, what the utility of our prioritization is? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2944.449s">Like,</a>  is that to put that in order of what you present to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2948.055s">Like,</a>  you know, say that we order it, number one, housing, number two, business development, number three, climate resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2954.46s">What</a>  does that influence? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2955.441s">Does</a>  that influence, okay, we're gonna package up all of the recommended zoning strategies for the committee in July, and then in August, we'll do the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2963.408s">Like</a>  what's the causal relationship between the prioritization and what we do next?</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2969.493s">So</a>  for me, the prioritization, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2973.075s">we</a>  can do it as I was telling you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2975.537s">This</a>  is the way we would do it in each of the big strategies, we would do it like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2979.941s">And</a>  one way of doing it is we do it with all the strategies we send it to you and you can tell us, yes, no, we agree, we do not agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2991.21s">The</a>  prioritization is mainly to create the work plan, what things we go first, what things we leave for later. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3003.315s">and</a>  to just see where we spend the most of our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3009.439s">It</a>  doesn't mean that it's not important and it's not that I need, I mean, I imagine that it's very difficult and that's why we, I didn't want to push you into do this and to give us our feedback because I understand that for <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3024.744s">Some</a>  people can be very difficult because they don't know like climate resiliency is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3029.408s">Housing</a>  is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3031.049s">So</a>  I totally understand that it's difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3033.111s">And</a>  so what we can do is we work the prioritization, we work the work plan, we present it to you, and you can tell us if you think that that is correct or if you think that this topic should go or this strategy should go first or this strategy, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3053.969s">We</a>  can do it either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3055.73s">If</a>  it's too difficult to say and prioritize, because I understand, and maybe the goals is very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3063.273s">It's</a>  easier when you go strategies by strategy because it is more specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3068.376s">And</a>  so, as I said, the climate, the heat mitigation, it's very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3076.759s">It</a>  can come later. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3078.32s">And</a>  first, we can really go for the ensure affordable housing for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3083.18s">I</a>  totally understand that that is that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3086.685s">But</a>  when you go through climate resiliency or housing, maybe you don't have it as clear.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3092.192s">So</a>  I'm just going to cut you off. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3097.439s">Councilor</a>  Callahan has had her hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3099.021s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3100.112s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3100.473s">So</a>  it seems to me that really, if we're just talking about timeline the most important thing is we don't choose to do one thing first, that we will realize when we then look at something else, but those are conflicting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3114.291s">So,</a>  things like for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3117.615s">creating</a>  more affordable housing and the natural environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3120.558s">Like</a>  if we're gonna be like zoning, great, we're gonna zone everywhere for tons of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3123.9s">And</a>  then we're like, oh, when we get to natural environment, we're like, oh crap, like we forgot that we actually meant to also prioritize this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3132.968s">So</a>  can we just look to see which ones could conflict with each other and make sure that we look at those at the same time or close to each other?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3145.66s">Go</a>  ahead, President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3146.581s">I</a>  think that's what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3148.282s">Examples</a>  of rating strategies section is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3151.244s">It</a>  takes similarly grouped things from multiple plans, says which topics they're in, if you could scroll down a little bit, and then kind of says, okay, there's like seven strategies, it falls under six topics, that's a five. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3166.667s">And</a>  then if you scroll down to the next one, it's like, yeah, we want Medford to be, we want to mitigate heat islands, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3174.438s">There's</a>  three strategies, it's only climate resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3177.762s">So</a>  it addresses that conflict question, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3181.055s">That</a>  first topic, that's across six of our topic areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3185.137s">We</a>  need to talk about that discreetly because if we talk about it by topic area, it's not gonna be useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3191.001s">It</a>  sounded to me like Paola was saying, if we could kind of just as a general thing, take these top goals, that that would provide them input as they go through these strategies to help inform what they think of as basically creating <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3208.226s">these</a>  little strategy summaries for each thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3210.311s">And</a>  I think that, to me, that's valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3212.818s">It's</a>  not saying this is more important than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3215.665s">It's</a>  saying <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3217.947s">You</a>  know, to me, it's easy for me to say, okay, I think all of them are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3221.87s">I'd</a>  like to do all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3223.171s">There</a>  are some of them that I would call a five and some of them I would call a two. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3227.074s">Heat</a>  islands, I care about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3228.916s">Do</a>  I think it's as urgent as the fact that nobody can live here? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3231.398s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3232.138s">So</a>  calling housing affordability a five and calling heat islands a two, which is what it is in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3236.822s">I'm</a>  just saying that as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3239.377s">But</a>  it sounds like the two options are we could either give a little bit of input now to help guide, or they could just do it themselves, and then we can come back with our changes later. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3248.044s">And</a>  to me, it seems valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3249.445s">I</a>  mean, at this point, it's eight o'clock, maybe we should just not do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3252.267s">We</a>  should just say, go ahead, Ines, and come up with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3256.77s">But</a>  that seemed to me to be where we were. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3258.992s">It</a>  took me a minute, but that does seem to be a valuable exercise to me to take five minutes and say, this goal is a five, this goal is a three, this goal is a two, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3268.317s">and</a>  hopefully that informs the work plan more than just having them develop it themselves without that kind of something to guide them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3278.464s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3279.225s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3280.225s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3280.766s">I</a>  just want to follow up on the point I was making and see if our planning department has any particular thoughts on that question, because I'm not convinced that the rating system that they came up with covers what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3294.955s">So</a>  for example, if we're like affordable housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3297.841s">We're</a>  gonna do that first and then mitigating heat islands is gonna be last. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3301.864s">Those</a>  could in fact be in conflict with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3304.205s">Whereas</a>  I think 18 hour communities and balanced growth are less in conflict with each other, but I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3309.428s">So</a>  I wanted to ask and see if you just have any initial thoughts that you could put in on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3316.993s">If</a>  any of these goals are things that if we don't consider them at the same time, we might regret it later.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3328.204s">If</a>  I may, Danielle, I'm a senior planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3331.045s">Yeah,</a>  so I'm having trouble with the ranking exercise, too, and I did it in conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3336.887s">So</a>  one of the strategies of increasing housing density would move forward increasing affordable housing, but to not be in conflict with some of the climate goals, you want to make sure you're going up in height and not completely covering <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3357.796s">the</a>  lot, so we wouldn't want 100% lot coverage where it's all hardscaped. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3363.54s">So</a>  I feel like it's all woven together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3365.761s">So</a>  it's, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3369.944s">If</a>  I may, I mean that we tackle one of these strategies first, it doesn't mean that we completely forget about the rest of the things that we have in our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3382.052s">And</a>  a lot of things can go together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3384.133s">So</a>  if we think that it might be a conflict, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3387.15s">so</a>  that if we have higher density, maybe we need to put together with certain strategies of climate resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3399.38s">So</a>  whenever we see that there needs to be a balance to put them in the work plan together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3406.725s">So</a>  absolutely, we have some areas that are more dense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3409.908s">We</a>  need to be aware that with climate resilience in mind, there are other areas that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3415.848s">not</a>  have SDANs, and so that locked coverages are not everywhere 100%, I think that that is very clear for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3427.076s">But</a>  maybe what we can do is <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3429.554s">wherever</a>  we see that some of these things might be in conflict, as I say, it really goes into very specific, because generically, I don't think they go in conflict, but when you go into the specific, could be, it's a matter of balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3446.2s">It's</a>  not really about, you cannot do this, because then you can't do the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3451.563s">It's</a>  about having a balance between both, and so that we can work <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3455.768s">in</a>  the work plan that we can put this together, even if it's high priority, lower priority, they can go in together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3462.629s">So</a>  yeah, I think that I got all your opinions and the part that worries you, I totally understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3473.631s">So</a>  what we can do is come up with the work plan that address all these issues.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3482.033s">Thank</a>  you, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3486.155s">Thinking</a>  about a path forward here, it strikes me that there might be a way to thread the needle here where we're giving a little bit more exposition during this committee meeting and the time that we have left. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3501.902s">And</a>  maybe we could go round the horn and have the Councilors give a top level <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3510.8s">And</a>  again, I think like maybe the word prioritization is like was throwing us off a little bit at the beginning of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3516.185s">But</a>  again, it's not about like what what are we not doing, but rather like what's very important to do first and thinking about prioritization at the same time as we're thinking about pairing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3526.573s">What</a>  does it make sense to do first with urgency? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3528.735s">What</a>  does it make sense to do together? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3530.649s">knowing</a>  that we're not going to be considering any of these strategies in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3534.611s">So</a>  I think we could possibly take 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3537.013s">Maybe</a>  Jimmy is just working on the mirror board in the background. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3540.274s">So</a>  we could go around and have Councilors kind of give their impressions, you know, again, and I don't really think this counts as off the top of our head because these are goals that we think about constantly as we're doing city business, you know, to give some impressions of if it's not the full one through five, but what's my one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3557.284s">We</a>  could just go around to take two minutes each and do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3560.087s">councilors</a>  felt more comfortable, we could, you know, spend 15 minutes on the mapping analysis to make sure we're in good shape to have a complete version of that submitted to us ahead of the June 26 meeting, and then we can come back and do two or three minutes each per councilor on the prioritization. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3577.438s">So</a>  that's just one proposal for me, is to go around and leave NS Associates with just a little bit of feedback from each of us before the end of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3585.483s">I'll</a>  recognize Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3588.188s">Well,</a>  so I asked to be recognized before the chair made the proposal, but I was actually going to make a motion to just have this emailed to Councilors after the meeting so that we could submit our feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3606.296s">And</a>  then outside the meeting, maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3610.646s">have</a>  Paola forward the sticky note page to us and then move on because I don't, given the fact that we all do tend to talk quite a bit, I do it too, I'm doing it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3624.095s">I</a>  think it would take more time than what we have left.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3629.959s">Certainly,</a>  I think that what I was proposing was a very explicitly pared down version of, I think certainly I could talk for <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3636.909s">an</a>  hour about the topics before us, but I think if we wanted to entertain the idea of saying, everybody has one minute, everybody has 90 seconds, everybody has two minutes, you don't have to say you're one through five, you can just say you're number one and number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3649.178s">And</a>  then certainly, you know, Councilors are always welcome and encouraged to submit further feedback and ideas to NS Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3657.605s">So</a>  me as chair at any time, we could certainly follow up with additional context over the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3661.608s">So</a>  we kind of have, let's decide on a path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3668.012s">I</a>  think I see one vote for taking a minute or two each. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3673.195s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3686.943s">I</a>  think that we should step away from this for 20 minutes and talk about the mapping analysis, because that's another very big piece that we haven't talked about yet to make sure that we have adequate time for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3696.394s">And</a>  then if we're left with five minutes, we can spend five minutes talking about our priorities.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3699.957s">Yeah,</a>  if Paola could just send that table that's in that document that you were just on, Paola, I can send it back with, I can just fill the whole thing out and send it back.</p>

    <p>[6XRDVyVUfUQ_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3707.883s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3708.984s">If</a>  you email it now, I can send it back to you in five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3711.926s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3716.49s">Paola,</a>  if you could circulate that by email, if you could send it to me and President Bearson, or President Bearson, the clerk,</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3724.062s">Yeah,</a>  just that little table that you were just on in the prioritization of strategies.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3730.186s">Yeah,</a>  I will do that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3734.068s">I'm</a>  sure Jimmy can move the. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3735.129s">What</a>  was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3736.81s">I'm</a>  sure Jimmy can move the sticky notes around by my next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3769.207s">Just</a>  let us know when you're sorted, Paola.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3771.208s">I</a>  just sent it to Zach.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3773.669s">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3775.57s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3776.271s">Thank</a>  you so much, and we'll try to revisit that in 15 or 20 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3781.802s">Let's</a>  go now to the mapping analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3784.443s">Thank</a>  you so much for preparing this memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3788.323s">This</a>  is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3788.903s">So</a>  my understanding is on June 26, the intent is to have these lists and bullet points manifested in an actual series of maps for us to review that, you know, demonstrate the analyses that will guide us as we do our, implement our global and district-wide <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3811.098s">zoning</a>  change strategies throughout the rest of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3813.44s">But</a>  Paola, can you just give us a idea of what is left to be done on the mapping analysis before the next committee meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3821.526s">The</a>  intent, the goal of the mapping analysis and what's needed from councillors to complete it?</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3830.333s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3830.754s">So</a>  with me is also Jimmy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3832.155s">He's</a>  our GIS specialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3834.777s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3836.624s">So</a>  we would like to do several sets of maps with the analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3845.111s">We</a>  would like to start with a non-conforming analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3848.013s">So</a>  this is to see which are the parcels that are non-conforming in each of the zoning districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3855.96s">And</a>  we will analyze the frontage, setback, height, lot size, the minimum building coverage, and lot coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3864.526s">These</a>  two are mainly <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3867.259s">lot</a>  coverage, and the impervious surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3872.401s">It</a>  has a different definition than in your zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3875.763s">So</a>  that's why these two words, I need to change them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3881.305s">But</a>  it mainly is that we are going to do frontage, setback, height, size, lot coverage, and impervious surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3892.411s">Those</a>  are the ones that we will do in nonconforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3896.335s">We</a>  want to prepare a base map. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3898.196s">And</a>  this is just the base map that we will use to project all these different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3904.118s">And</a>  this base map will have the main characteristics of Medford in order to be easy to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3914.762s">So</a>  all the important things that should be on the map so that it's easier to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3922.826s">So</a>  like the river, the fells, train stations, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3926.972s">In</a>  here, because we started already and at the beginning, these were the things that we will do on the base map. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3935.96s">We</a>  will have all these together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3937.602s">So</a>  chapter 91 lands, hydrography and wetlands, the FEMA, open space, parks and trails. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3944.948s">This</a>  is too much information to have in one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3947.731s">So</a>  what we are going to do is have a base map. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3950.153s">We</a>  will have another one with all the hydrology information. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3954.261s">the</a>  Chapter 91 lands, hydrography and wetlands, and the FEMA, and another one with the recreational map with all the open space, parks, and trails. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3967.632s">Then</a>  we go to the residential clusters. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3971.375s">These</a>  will be all the parcels with all the different residential units that are in <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3982.418s">This</a>  is mainly to see the density on the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3986.679s">So</a>  a single unit, two unit, three unit, and then four to nine, 10 to 20, plus 20, and then the rest of the non-residential uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3997.783s">Then</a>  we will have transit and accessibility, all the local transit stops, routes, and bike paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4007.067s">So</a>  we will have bike paths, blue bike, MBTA bus routes, MBTA train routes, and then the quarter and half mile radius around the major transit nodes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4022.239s">So</a>  it's easy for us to understand, or walking is an interesting distance to do walking movements. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4034.925s">Then</a>  we'd like to do socioeconomics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4037.627s">So</a>  this is ethnicity, income, age, all by the census tract, and then environmental justice population. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4047.675s">The</a>  sixth one will be the value. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4049.236s">So</a>  building value, land value, and total value all in one map. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4055.101s">The</a>  set that we call anchors with all the municipal assets, major institutions, major employers, and retail and service centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4065.04s">And</a>  then housing stock and historic location. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4068.023s">So</a>  all the different ages of the existing houses stock is split into decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4075.47s">And</a>  then the historic properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4077.652s">So</a>  these are all the different sets that we would like to do before 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4083.157s">And</a>  Jimmy is...</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4087.475s">very</a>  hard for that overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4089.937s">And</a>  I think that'd be really helpful in guiding us for both of the tracks that we're talking about global strategies and district strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4098.943s">And</a>  I think my, my only question at this point is, you know, what do you need from councilors or city staff to complete these by our next committee meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4110.25s">So</a>  that we can do these?</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4113.132s">Yes,</a>  we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4115.245s">gathering</a>  all the information at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4118.607s">And</a>  I think Jimmy has everything we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4122.93s">But</a>  Jimmy, if there is anything that you need to add, please let them know.</p>

    <p>[Jimmy Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4129.535s">Yeah,</a>  I can add to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4131.656s">Thank</a>  you, Kit, for asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4133.017s">I</a>  think I have all the data I need. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4135.639s">I</a>  think one data set that would be of use is a neighborhood data set, if you guys have anything that <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4144.813s">signifies,</a>  you know, shape files for each specific neighborhood for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4149.558s">But</a>  other than that, I have all the data that I need to complete the mapping.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4154.883s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4155.743s">Can</a>  I speak to the neighborhood thing for a minute? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4157.966s">Just</a>  so you know, we have maps with neighborhood names on them, but we have never drawn the lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4165.151s">because</a>  that results in people arguing a lot about the borders. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4169.874s">However,</a>  I feel like for the purposes of analysis, if it's helpful, like there are some lines that could be drawn and some of them are bleedingly obvious, like Felsway West and Felsway borders, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4183.784s">That</a>  cuts, divides neighborhoods and the river divides neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4188.628s">I'll</a>  provide you with the map that has like the names, but the names don't have lines around them.</p>

    <p>[Jimmy Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4195.908s">Okay,</a>  I mean, that would be great regardless. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4199.229s">I</a>  don't plan to use the boundaries for any sort of analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4204.03s">It's</a>  just more for a visual representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4207.29s">So</a>  like you said, if people are gonna get up in arms about it, just a text for the neighborhood would be fine for the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4217.913s">So</a>  thank you for that, Alicia.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4220.623s">Great,</a>  thank you, Paola and Jimmy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4222.464s">It's</a>  great to hear that this is continuing apace. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4226.366s">I</a>  know that Councilor Callahan has to depart in just a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4229.587s">Are</a>  there any additional comments on the mapping analysis or should we start our very quick bullet point prioritization to round out the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4238.672s">President</a>  Paris?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4239.508s">I</a>  was just wondering, are we going to be able to see these different layers on top of each other and be able to have just two layers on at a time or one? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4249.451s">Or</a>  how exactly is that going to work?</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4257.373s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4257.833s">So</a>  yes, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4260.833s">You</a>  can set the layers to have it on and off so that <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4267.438s">Whenever</a>  we need certain information, we just use that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4271.501s">So</a>  these are the sets with absolutely all the information that we're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4276.065s">And</a>  then in order to do different analysis, we can have the base map and then we want the residential clusters, but we only want to see the very high density and the value of those buildings so that we can mix and match. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4292.037s">So</a>  in order to be helpful for our analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4295.714s">So</a>  at the moment, these are the thematic buckets. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4299.256s">And</a>  then what we will have is all these analysis are going to be there for us to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4305.239s">However,</a>  we want to mix and match.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4308.601s">Thank</a>  you, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4309.161s">I'm</a>  really excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4309.981s">I</a>  think that'll be a really flexible tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4312.283s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4312.643s">I'm</a>  excited to see that in our next committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4318.346s">With</a>  that, I apologize for the quick pivot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4321.107s">I</a>  think we should start our <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4323.817s">quick</a>  recap of priority rankings, priority call-outs, so that we can get to that before councilors have to start leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4333.081s">So</a>  again, let's do a quick one or two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4335.662s">It</a>  can be as short as you need it to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4338.042s">If</a>  there's any impressions, ranking, prioritizations, those topics, Councilor Callahan, start with you.</p>
