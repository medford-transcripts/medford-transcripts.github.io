    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=0.06s">Let's</a>  call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2.061s">President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2.882s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3.783s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4.543s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5.144s">Councilwoman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5.944s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=6.685s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=7.886s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli is absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=10.487s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=11.828s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=13.93s">Four</a>  present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=16.171s">The</a>  meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=18.873s">At</a>  this meeting, we will again revisit paper <a href="../resolutions/24-033.pdf"><font color="green">24-033</font></a>, offered by President Bears and Vice President Collins, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=32.857s">The</a>  agenda says this is the fourth Zoning Updates meeting with Innes Associates, but I think the actual number is higher than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=38.959s">For</a>  this meeting, we have agreed on the following agenda, to look at priority zoning recommendations from the Climate Adaptation and Action Plan, to prioritize zoning recommendations from the 2023 Comprehensive Plan, discussing completing the mapping analysis by June 30, and to discuss new topics that came up during the May 8 committee meeting that should be added to our work plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=61.475s">including</a>  legal definitions and formatting and permitting and process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=70.284s">Given</a>  that, that's a lot to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=72.506s">I</a>  know that NS Associates has prepared a memo with a first draft of pulling those zoning recommendations from the comp plan and the climate adaptation and action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=82.195s">So</a>  there's a lot to potentially go over in that already. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=87.446s">speaking</a>  as one councilor, speaking as the chair, I think my ideal goals for this meeting are to do an overview of the existing recommendations that Innes Associates has already pulled from the cap and the comp plan, to have a discussion on that with councilors towards the goal of at our next committee meeting on June 26, making sure that councilors, Innis and staff all feel comfortable that all of the recommendations that should be pulled from the climate action and adaptation plan and the comp plan <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=117.145s">have</a>  been fully culled, they're all in our work plan, and that we've also talked about assigning priority levels to those zoning recommendations so that we can enter into the new fiscal year feeling like our source documents have been properly vetted and that way we can just approach things by topic and by neighborhood from there on out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=136.691s">I'd</a>  also love for us to have a discussion about kind of how we can <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=142.179s">codifying,</a>  putting legal definitions in format, permitting and process into the work timeline to make sure that gets baked in, and then discussing what we need to do to make sure that the mapping analysis, which I think is in a draft stage, will be completed and ready for review at the June 26th committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=160.815s">Before</a>  we get started with reviewing, I want to pass it off to NS Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=165.94s">Any</a>  preliminary comments from Councilors?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=173.911s">The</a>  only thing, and maybe we can talk about it more on the 26th, that I think would be good to at least start talking about is the, and it's kind of in here as the new topics, but the work plan, kind of the two tracks of the work plan that we talked about recently, where we'd have kind of the global citywide <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=197.97s">changes</a>  on one track and then changes that are going to require different local neighborhood discussions or essentially the district by district and neighborhood type changes on another track and hopefully kind of try to have that out there well in advance so the residents can be informed and know when we're going to be talking about their neighborhood as it relates to the comp plan and all the other changes we want to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=227.216s">just</a>  that I think maybe we can take that to the 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=229.516s">Maybe</a>  it's like a natural next step from this final topic here on our agenda today.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=235.498s">Thank</a>  you, president bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=236.418s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=237.338s">I</a>  think it'd be great to publish that well in advance so that residents have lots of lead time to know when changes that might affect their neighborhood are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=244.94s">Um,</a>  and I think it would be a great segue to, I think it could be a great segue to complete this categorization <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=252.875s">pulling</a>  from the cap and the comp plan and making sure that we've been thorough and comprehensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=257.879s">It</a>  seems to me that we might be able to solidify the work plan for the global and the district changes once we kind of have the full scope of what we're looking at and how those might file in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=270.009s">Any</a>  preliminary comments from city staff before I turn it over to Ines Associates? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=280.197s">Well,</a>  I'll turn it over to Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=282.799s">And,</a>  um, I was thinking open to alternative ideas on this, but knowing that we have, uh, reviewing the, um, the memo that was circulated to Councilors last week with that draft of, uh, Zona recommendations pulled from the cap and the comp plan, um, there's quite a lot to discuss in there so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=303.37s">And</a>  I think that we'd probably all appreciate adjourning no later than eight 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=307.256s">So</a>  to me, I think that our time could be best served doing kind of a general overview, not going through things necessarily in great detail line by line. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=316.001s">But</a>  I know that my priority is making sure that everything that ought to be on that list is and working on assigning a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=324.206s">So</a>  if we could kind of do a high level overview of what's currently in that memo. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=329.798s">Paola,</a>  and if you could speak to, you know, if there's anything that you particularly think ought to be flagged, anything that didn't make it in, and why I think that that might be most helpful for starting us out.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=342.203s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=343.204s">Good</a>  afternoon, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=344.504s">This</a>  is Paola from Menace Associates, representing Emily, the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=351.747s">And</a>  with me is the GIS expert, Jim Irosha, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=358.693s">Um,</a>  so yes, I think that what I was. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=363.597s">Actually,</a>  what I wanted to do was going really explaining what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=367.08s">Um,</a>  and then ask if there are any, uh, comments or things that you didn't see that you would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=375.127s">So</a>  get more of the feedback from you instead of reading one by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=379.43s">Um,</a>  so I'm going to share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=383.253s">So</a>  we can see it maybe a bit better.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=385.475s">I</a>  think the plan sounds great.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=387.277s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=390.841s">Here</a>  we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=398.585s">Yeah,</a>  so as you said, the agenda is about the SONY recommendations from the Climate Adaptation Action Plan and the recommendations from the 2023 Comprehensive Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=410.691s">At</a>  the moment, we have a list with all of them, each in one table. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=418.673s">And</a>  actually, what I wanted to do today was more to get your feedback on how we do the prioritization. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=427.697s">So</a>  we have an idea and a method, and that's mainly what we wanted to run by you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=434.0s">But</a>  we can go step by step. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=437.362s">And</a>  so that we all agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=442.465s">So</a>  first, the first <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=447.369s">topic</a>  that we treat was the climate resilience. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=450.95s">And</a>  we took it from in the in the table, you are going to have the number and the number is exactly the number that is, it's taken by the by the CAP, the Climate Adaptation Action Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=464.895s">So</a>  you see the number, we have the big goals first, and in bold, and then after that, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=474.571s">you</a>  will see the recommendations that are more specific to this first goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=481.377s">So</a>  for example, we have diverse and affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=484.84s">We</a>  explain what it entails. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=488.623s">And</a>  then we have the three sub strategies that comes with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=498.372s">You</a>  will see the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=500.405s">In</a>  this cap, we only use the climate resiliency, but actually, there are more topics that are influenced directly by this, and we will see it later, that we will use to create, to prioritize these strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=517.329s">Where</a>  does it come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=518.389s">So</a>  in this case, it's the cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=520.649s">And</a>  then after, so the next weeks we want to, as Zach Barrett said, we want to work on the work plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=529.639s">That's</a>  why we today wanted to work on the priority, because it will help us to go through the work plan and so that every of these strategies can be more specific to which phase are going to be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=543.89s">In</a>  this, in the first table, you will see inside the strategies, these like B51. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=552.336s">This</a>  comes from the zoning memorandum that we've been working. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=556.092s">And</a>  these are the strategies and suggestions that came from the Department of Planning and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=563.861s">And</a>  so what we did is include these ones in exactly the strategy from the CAB that we thought were more appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=573.692s">So,</a>  for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=576.061s">In</a>  this case, the B51 overlay district that has a lot of different suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=582.204s">The</a>  density zone was applied to this strategy, the BE11B. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=591.029s">And</a>  you can see that all the way we have the BE12, high-performance new buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=596.592s">This</a>  comes from the CAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=598.813s">And</a>  then from the department, the suggestions about the eco-roof ordinance, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=603.672s">is</a>  in here, or the B49 by right allowances is in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=608.253s">So</a>  we tried to not have a lot of different tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=611.494s">We</a>  wanted to have one in this case that took all the climate resiliency suggestions into one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=618.675s">And</a>  that's why you will see these bold numbers B51, B52, B47 in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=624.016s">This</a>  is for the climate resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=634.853s">And</a>  then if I go a bit further, we will see the list of objectives and actions typed in changes, but this comes from the comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=649.044s">So</a>  in here, we did the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=650.325s">We</a>  have the number of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=651.827s">The</a>  main one, it's in bold. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=655.269s">And</a>  then the more specific are later on in normal letters, not usable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=664.285s">Then</a>  we have the topics, the main ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=667.387s">Obviously,</a>  as the other ones, sometimes we have several because it's not only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=672.069s">These</a>  usually overlap and usually almost always overlap with different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=677.712s">But</a>  here we try to do the main ones that affect these strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=686.203s">In</a>  here, this table is only for the comp plan, so that for now it's easier to see and not to have them all together and overlap. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=698.091s">And</a>  yeah, it's exactly the same as the other one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=700.693s">We</a>  have the number, the specification, so the description of the strategy, the topics that are treated and the origin, and we will work on the phase and the priority <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=716.787s">the</a>  26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=720.57s">So</a>  what I was expecting is that if you have any doubts or if you have any comments on this, that we will love to hear about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=733.437s">What</a>  I want to show you is, and maybe we can do this after, what we have prepared is also how to treat priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=742.402s">And</a>  so what we can do is that I stop here at the moment <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=745.765s">we</a>  can see if there are any doubts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=747.887s">If</a>  you want me to read one by one, I can totally do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=752.03s">Or</a>  if there is any specific that you want to tell me about, we can go to those specific strategies.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=767.54s">I'll</a>  go first to President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=768.921s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=770.482s">And</a>  I just had one, I think this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=772.563s">I</a>  just had one quick change from the Climate Adaptation Action Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=778.587s">I</a>  just think that BE 1.1 should probably be like an HP or maybe HPHA instead of in CR, but the rest of that did seem to be climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=790.015s">At</a>  least that's how I read BE 1.1.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=795.086s">Oh,</a>  this one's yeah, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=798.248s">So</a>  this will come also later, because it does affect climate resiliency in because you have more, maybe it's the density, change densities, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=810.093s">So</a>  it has different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=811.514s">And</a>  it's, they are very intertwined, it's difficult to take one without the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=819.298s">And</a>  so this is what we are going to use later for the prioritizing the <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=824.858s">The</a>  strategies affect different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=827.399s">The</a>  more they affect, the more impact they are going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=830.68s">And</a>  that is a way of prioritizing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=834.121s">But</a>  so what I can do and what I wanted to do is to add also main topics that also are affected by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=841.983s">So</a>  I totally agree that this one should be H-A-C-R so that we have both in them.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=848.846s">Yeah,</a>  and I think H-P as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=850.426s">But</a>  I hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=851.306s">I</a>  think adding to the list makes sense.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=856.789s">You</a>  will see later what I mean.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=860.371s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=861.232s">The</a>  rest of the CAAP, you know, recommendations seem pretty solidly in the climate resiliency bucket to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=874.44s">Well,</a>  now we get back down to the accessible neighborhoods and maybe I'm, yeah, I can see something that could have some overlap there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=881.244s">But</a>  I like the idea of going through, I don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=885.126s">Maybe,</a>  maybe we could go through the bolded ones like the, with just the one point, you know, without the sub letters and maybe we could prioritize those first.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=896.294s">Yeah,</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=897.835s">So</a>  I can go now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=898.975s">Do</a>  you want me to go now?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=900.957s">Great,</a>  Paula. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=901.457s">Yeah,</a>  just to jump in quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=902.778s">I</a>  think that's a great place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=905.8s">And</a>  as I'm looking through this, you know, I think my priorities for the 26th is, and if we, if there's a way to <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=913.547s">have</a>  this reflected in the updated table, if we can kind of be in a process of over the next two weeks, kind of as much as possible, disaggregating the zoning goals with the specific zoning strategies, or replacing some of the goals with specific strategies to achieve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=931.815s">I</a>  think how you have it laid out for today is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=933.836s">And</a>  I hope that, you know, through our discussion and revision over the next couple of weeks, it can be, you know, kind of more like left column, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=940.925s">goal</a>  that this recommendation is pointing to, column next to that, here are the specific zoning changes that would get us closer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=947.929s">And</a>  I believe the bolded headings right now are, for the most part, the goals that have specific strategies attached to them at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=959.815s">Should</a>  we start there? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=960.735s">And</a>  Paolo, was it your intention that we would kind of start there and we could also be talking about prioritization as we're going through those strategies? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=970.523s">Director</a>  Hunt, I want to recognize you if you had a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=972.845s">I</a>  might have missed your hand.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=977.528s">I'm</a>  having a little trouble following some of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=985.473s">And</a>  some of it is, I just want to, for anybody who's following who is lost, the key for the topics is at the very bottom of the chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=993.058s">So</a>  this is all, if anybody is watching, this attachment that we're looking at is, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=999.523s">in</a>  the handouts for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1002.224s">But</a>  the key that tells you what CRHPHA are is in the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1007.647s">But</a>  there isn't actually a key to the letters on the left in the left-hand column. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1017.452s">And</a>  I am having trouble remembering what all of these things stand for, because they're not ringing a bell from either the climate plan or the <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1027.799s">comprehensive</a>  plan, the WSVP in the left-hand column. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1032.903s">So</a>  that was a little bit confusing, and I just wanna make sure, it seemed to me, I was trying to follow, some of these are goals, these are not things that we're gonna do, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1044.593s">We're</a>  going to try to achieve them, and many of them are actions, and it wasn't actually clear to me that only the things that are bold are goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1059.139s">And</a>  so some of these things, like how do we properly separate some of these?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1068.243s">Yeah,</a>  thank you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1069.804s">I</a>  know, I think that's, you more eloquently put the point I was trying to make just now, which is right now we have the goals and some strategies to achieve them in the same column. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1078.308s">I</a>  think that's totally fine for a first draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1080.322s">But</a>  I think that it's important for the, you know, comprehensive and updated version that we look at in a couple weeks that we separate the actual strategy that's being recommended of this body from what's the point of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1093.155s">Why</a>  are we doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1094.176s">What</a>  goal does it relate to? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1095.237s">And</a>  what topic does that goal fit within? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1098.641s">Maybe</a>  it's a matter of just a column getting added if we have number <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1103.544s">Sarah</a>  Silver, PB): Goal and then recommended zoning related action or something along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1107.89s">But</a>  right now, I think it's confusing to have goals and strategies aggregated together.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1111.435s">Sarah</a>  Silver, PB): Right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1112.076s">And</a>  I think part of it is, for example, under be the very beginning is a great example though that diverse and affordable housing housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1119.266s">It's</a>  like a title. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1120.575s">But</a>  actually 1.1a, reduce zoning barriers to multifamily and mixed-use housing development is the thing I think we're gonna do throughout this entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1130.198s">And</a>  enables, although enables small and more diverse housing options through zoning updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1135.619s">Like</a>  we're doing the zoning updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1137.78s">We</a>  wanna keep that in mind as we do this, that those are some of our goals of the entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1144.722s">And</a>  I see that one recommendation is to create an overlay district. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1148.906s">Whereas</a>  there are other things in here that are seeing much more actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1155.531s">And</a>  that maybe we need a separate list of like, what are our high level goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1159.495s">That</a>  is just a separate table. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1160.796s">These</a>  are our high level goals that you could keep referring back to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1164.338s">And</a>  here are things that we're going to do throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1167.081s">And</a>  a little bit of it is because I'm anxious to actually getting to changing <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1173.143s">talking</a>  about actually in this district, what in this area, what do we want the borders to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1178.165s">And</a>  what do we want the dimensions to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1180.505s">And</a>  what do we want to add for performance standards?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1183.646s">So,</a>  yeah, 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1184.687s">And</a>  I think that I'm feeling similarly, you know, I think it's this is necessary runway up to getting to the point where we're taking votes on strategies that get us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1193.289s">But</a>  we're here to take votes on the strategies that will allow us to actually to actually reduce the zoning barriers to multifamily and mixed use housing development, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1203.17s">Um,</a>  so, you know, just to restate as one Councilor, my priority is to make sure that every, every, every strategy that has been put into the cap and the comp plan so far as a change that we could vote on and make that would achieve these goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1218.7s">I</a>  want to make sure that that's in this table or an updated version of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1222.262s">Um,</a>  so that, you know, at the beginning of July, what we have is a list is essentially a to do list. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1228.84s">Um,</a>  so I think for today, you know, I think all of this aligns with what you were talking about is making sure that discussing what's here, if there's any flags that are raised from Councilors are the things that strategies that are in here that are confusing or strategies that aren't in here that we think should be, um, and to work on, you know, assigning perhaps a priority level to the strategies that are already inside as a bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1255.359s">Yeah,</a>  I think it might also be useful to both of your points to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1260.821s">I</a>  mean, I think we can do what you just said and kind of go through this and put some general priorities down, but I think it might actually be useful to, instead of have like almost a turn the table, like instead of having the numbers and headers from the plans be like the defining column, but to have the topics be the column, and then we could split it out into goals and actions <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1283.188s">grouped</a>  within the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1284.328s">I</a>  mean, I think we're kind of doing it just as like, if this was a spreadsheet, I would just move a column and then sort it differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1290.27s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1290.891s">Um,</a>  so, and I think it might, like, it might be useful for us to take, like, I generally think that most of the things in bold here are goal statements and most of the sub headers are like different <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1304.756s">possible</a>  actions that could happen within each topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1308.46s">I</a>  think it might be useful for us to have a table, like take the goals that are under each topic and kind of come up with what you just said, Alicia, like a general goal statement for each topic area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1318.811s">I</a>  think these are a great starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1321.574s">We</a>  probably would <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1323.584s">narrow</a>  them down a little bit so we don't have like a nine bullet point kind of necessarily goal statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1330.151s">And</a>  then have the specific recommended strategies in there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1337.119s">And</a>  then I think the other piece of this, like to Alicia's point, like I think there's two things we can do here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1341.344s">Like</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1344.162s">One</a>  is, there's one track of this that's like, we want to look at all of our district and our map, and we want to talk about what uses we want and what places, what dimensional requirements we want in which places, and essentially what we want neighborhoods, corridors, and squares to look like across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1364.51s">And</a>  then there's what are things that we want to be <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1369.181s">happening</a>  in all of those districts for all of the new construction, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1373.084s">Like</a>  we, like some of the, um, climate resiliency type stuff, like we're going to want new construction generally. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1379.608s">And</a>  maybe it's not in all of them because I don't, I don't know how the building code interacts with quite frankly, that's a piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1386.612s">I</a>  have a lot less, uh, understanding of, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1392.116s">general</a>  guidelines that we would want to apply to the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1397.098s">And</a>  to me, it's, um, it's the climate resiliency and the housing affordability and the, to an extent, the economic development and business growth and the transportation and multimodal ways like those seem to me to be more like we want complete streets everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1414.864s">We</a>  want net zero construction everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1417.244s">We</a>  want, um, you know, more housing affordability everywhere we want <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1422.478s">more</a>  business growth in all parts of the city and what are policies that can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1426.639s">And</a>  then that's one track of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1428.339s">Then</a>  there's a track of things that is, this is kind of the specific like form, um, of, you know, the shape and size of structures and the vision of lots and like what, um, and the heights and densities in different parts of the city, um, and redrawing the boundaries and barriers of, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1450.367s">of</a>  the zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1451.568s">So,</a>  um, that just to me, I think is a good, a way that I could think about this a little more clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1459.435s">And</a>  I think to like, just taking that, maybe taking these, all of these topics and putting them into those two buckets and then taking kind of resorting this, um, list of recommendations from the climate and comprehensive plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1476.823s">to</a>  have be like shorter tables under each topic area could be a way of organizing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1482.728s">Um,</a>  but I also think we could go through today and at least talk about prioritizing some of these, but again, it, yeah, like I, my top priority is reducing zoning barriers to multifamily and mixed use housing development. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1500.763s">And</a>  then also probably something in the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1507.025s">you</a>  know, not necessarily undertaking corridor and commercial center studies, but allowing an appropriate mix of uses and land controls for cohesive development along corridors and within squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1515.692s">Like</a>  those are my two big ones.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1518.414s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1519.635s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1520.275s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1520.435s">And</a>  I think I would co-sign those priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1524.018s">Um,</a>  but in terms of our strategy for today, um, you know, I think we're all eager to get, put some, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1533.865s">to</a>  successfully get through the part of the process we're figuring out how to fit these goals on the page in a way that makes our work easier so that we can proceed along to the point where we're actually discussing the material changes that are being recommended to achieve the goals that are being articulated in the updated version of the spreadsheet or any others. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1553.579s">And</a>  it made me think about the flowchart or spreadsheet that's in the implementation section of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan itself, which <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1562.941s">always</a>  stuck with me because I found it so readable and useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1568.104s">And</a>  maybe I think what we're talking about is like a one step more granular version of that, where right now, like that has... I think that's exactly what I was just looking at.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1579.85s">That's</a>  why I laughed.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1581.25s">Yeah,</a>  no, I mean, that's what's been sticking in my brain because that implementation matrix is so useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1585.593s">I</a>  can bring it up if you give me a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1588.494s">There's</a>  an implementation matrix at the back of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1594.564s">I</a>  can bring that up unless somebody has it at their fingertips.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1596.605s">But</a>  I think like, if I might, when the air blows, you have to project more because it's hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1602.028s">It's</a>  the white noise is making it hard to hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1604.329s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1605.209s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1605.649s">And</a>  I guarantee I am trying as hard as I possibly can.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1611.192s">It's</a>  the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1611.912s">It's</a>  not you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1612.712s">I</a>  know.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1613.893s">That's</a>  why it's so frustrating.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1616.174s">It's</a>  a little box up there, a little cardboard box. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1622.297s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1625.779s">We're</a>  going to make a supplemental appropriation for a little Barbie mic for me so that people can hear me for the first time ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1632.863s">Hang</a>  on one sec. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1633.463s">I'm</a>  going to pull up the CAP plan.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1648.971s">I</a>  have here the topics in this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1655.323s">Alicia,</a>  the BE and all this EN that you're seeing there, it's over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1663.727s">These</a>  are the main goals from the CAP and the main goals from the COMP plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1668.209s">I</a>  have it here because I wanted to use this so that you can help me or I can get your feedback on the importance and rating these big goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1680.342s">Yeah,</a>  sorry for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1682.043s">We</a>  tried to simplify it as much as possible to just get the priorities first. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1690.566s">But</a>  I agree that there is still a lot of work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1695.028s">This</a>  is a work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1697.549s">And</a>  so we also want to group all these strategies in the sections of the zoning that needs to be changed so that we only do these things once. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1709.389s">So</a>  all the strategies that, for example, are talking about changing dimensions and uses or that are about standards, to group them so that we know that, OK, let's change the dimensions in order to achieve these goals and all these strategies, and so that we pass only once and we don't have to do that many times going from goal to goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1738.564s">So</a>  there are a lot of ways and different ways to continue to explore this and group to make it as easy as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1746.409s">And</a>  so, yes, I agree with all your suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1751.032s">We</a>  can separate goals and then do another column for the specific strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1756.576s">We</a>  will add also the part of the zoning that needs to be changed and altered in order to achieve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1762.66s">So</a>  we all have, okay, this is about the dimensions, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1767.099s">the</a>  standards on these on mixed use or in this district, and so that we have all those also. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1775.842s">But</a>  I didn't want to bring a lot of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1778.523s">It's</a>  already a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1780.124s">And</a>  I really wanted to focus on having this kind of rating so we can prioritize a bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1788.247s">But</a>  totally, I agree with everything you've said.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1791.188s">Thank</a>  you, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1793.749s">I</a>  really appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1796.38s">this</a>  is really helpful, this table.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1800.226s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1801.448s">No,</a>  I think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1803.352s">Just</a>  since we're talking about it really quickly, I'm going to share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1813.246s">So</a>  this is not as useful as I thought it would be because the version of the cap that's on the city website has the way that two page view works is it's just flipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1821.872s">So</a>  what's on the left should be on the right, but I think this gives an idea at least of, you know, this kind of stepping down towards granularity. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1834.441s">What's</a>  the word I'm looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1836.823s">Visual</a>  layout that we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1838.72s">or</a>  at least that I'm kind of thinking of, of starting with the goal and then saying within this, you know, and maybe what I mean by making this more granular is instead of here having strategy and action is having, you know, replacing that action with the specific zoning change that's recommended to achieve that goal or that strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1859.774s">So</a>  just, I just wanted to provide a visual guide for what I was, what we were describing earlier since we were talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1866.359s">And</a>  again, sorry that this page is <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1868.962s">flipped,</a>  but I think this gives you a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1871.424s">Another</a>  thing that I like about this, just in terms of a template, I think it's helpful to have a snapshot of a timeline over which, as we get into strategies that will require more research, more neighborhood meetings, I think it would be great to have a snapshot of the time that we might need to take on those strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1898.948s">and</a>  like other benchmarks kind of in the same spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1904.733s">And</a>  Paola, you mentioned that maybe for next time as we pursue all the updates that we've discussed so far in the updated version of the spreadsheet, I think it would be great to have a link to where specifically in the zoning that update or addition might occur as we get into specific strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1926.13s">I</a>  think that that would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1928.191s">And</a>  I really appreciate you, you know, trying to pace us into this and I speaking for probably not only myself, I know that we're all really eager to get through the phase of visioning and talking about strategies and getting into the nitty gritty. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1941.556s">So</a>  thank you for not throwing us into the deep end, but as one Councilor, I'm eager to be thrown into the deep end. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1948.999s">Should</a>  we return to kind of a conversation of prioritization at this point, I'll make sure at the end that we're kind of all clear on <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1955.546s">the</a>  updates to the spreadsheet that we wanna see for next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1959.447s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1960.267s">Could</a>  we take a look at the kind of more simplified tables that Paula just said? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1964.888s">Yeah,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1965.688s">Because</a>  I think it might be better to like go through those than to go through each of the, I think that sounds like what you were saying, Paula, if I heard you right.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1975.671s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1977.211s">So</a>  our idea today was to have this exercise of <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1982.541s">These</a>  are the topics, the big goals from the CAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1984.963s">These</a>  are the big goals from the COMP plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1988.086s">Associated</a>  with this, we also included the different topics that are related to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=1994.731s">And</a>  this comes, as you said, Alicia, at the end of the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2005.66s">Because</a>  if we start writing all this HA, housing affordability, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2011.36s">house</a>  production, economic development, it just, it gets too messy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2016.524s">So</a>  that's why this is so helpful, but it is in the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2021.287s">And</a>  then what I wanted to show you is how we would do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2026.711s">So</a>  it's to prioritize it's at some point, it gets very subjective. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2033.275s">And</a>  what we wanted is to make it as subjective as possible and to work with <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2040.211s">how</a>  much impact this strategy has and to somehow have a number or give a number to that, how impacted it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2053.48s">We</a>  developed this like three questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2056.002s">The</a>  first one is, do this strategy appears in both plans or only in one? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2062.186s">That</a>  is the first question that we make. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2064.428s">And</a>  so, for example, you see here the B1, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2068.44s">and</a>  the WS11 that are very similar in their intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2076.942s">And</a>  so we know that these will appear in both. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2080.403s">It's</a>  kind of important if it has some kind of overlap, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2084.484s">And</a>  then we have, the second question is how many topics are involved in these two, in these strategies? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2093.746s">And</a>  so we have, for example, here under we have <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2096.854s">Well,</a>  this one will talk about affordability, production, economic development, climate resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2103.695s">And</a>  also, it's directly, but a bit less than the others or less influence than the others, will be the corridors and the uses and districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2115.597s">So</a>  they are also there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2116.618s">So</a>  we know that these have a huge impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2120.358s">And</a>  then the third question that we ask is, is it <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2125.103s">a</a>  strategy that should be applied in the whole city, or is it a strategy that is applied only to certain areas, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2131.927s">And</a>  so that is like the third thing that we look in order to rate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2136.39s">And</a>  so, for example, this BE11, it's rated as an importance of five. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2144.335s">All</a>  these strategies are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2146.738s">and</a>  that we are rating it a bit less, it doesn't mean that we're not going to make them or that we're not going to care about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2153.842s">It's</a>  just to help us to create this work plan and to focus on very big and important and the efforts where we wanted to place them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2163.267s">But</a>  it doesn't mean that we are not going to worry about others that will have a less kind of importance rate that I wanted to make very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2172.848s">For</a>  example, we have this another example, and this is the high heat mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2178.391s">It</a>  is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2181.012s">It</a>  appears in both plans, but it's so specific that it only affects climate resiliency directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2188.776s">Indirectly,</a>  it affects many things, but let's say directly only that topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2193.759s">And</a>  so because it's that specific, we have it as an importance of two. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2198.973s">And</a>  so this is a bit of how we will do this with these strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2206.615s">And</a>  these were only some examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2209.455s">And</a>  so what we wanted for me today is having this in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2214.816s">We</a>  would like to go through all these topics and if we could rate them, if you could rate them and give us the feedback, which ones do you really think that are five or <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2229.208s">three</a>  or one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2230.088s">I</a>  don't need all the numbers, but something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2234.569s">Um,</a>  we have prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2237.87s">This</a>  board so that and Jimmy is there to help me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2242.91s">Um</a>  so that we have here all the big goals and that Jimmy will help me to assign each color is for one of the Councilors or city members and to start <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2259.213s">putting</a>  these post-its on the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 rating, if there's something that you would like to test. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2269.6s">So</a>  while we talk and discuss, Jimmy is in the background doing this, so then we can take it home with all your opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2277.324s">Is</a>  there something that you would like to do, or do you want to have a bit more time to process this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2284.609s">Let</a>  me know.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2287.094s">Before</a>  I recognize President Bears, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2289.556s">I</a>  think this is a very creative way to do this exercise. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2292.678s">Just</a>  my first instinct is I'm kind of of two minds on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2297.342s">I</a>  think this is an exercise we could do synchronously. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2299.544s">I</a>  think this is something that Councilors could do asynchronously as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2309.815s">I</a>  think that there also could be value in kind of going through a row and discussing that to kind of make sure that we're aligned on rating systems and then making sure that additional feedback is sent back to Innocence City staff on a reasonable timeline over the next week, perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2328.467s">In</a>  any case, I do just want to acknowledge that we also want to talk about the status of the mapping analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2336.032s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2338.328s">tonight</a>  and it's 7.45. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2339.269s">So</a>  if we are going to have a conversation about prioritization, I just think that we should probably try to keep that to no more than 30 minutes to make sure that we get through the rest of our agenda and have time to get solid on our plan for June 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2352.456s">I'm</a>  sorry, Councilor Leming, you are next and then President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2357.378s">Thank</a>  you, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2358.919s">I</a>  do appreciate the energy that has clearly been put into breaking down a very <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2366.795s">complicated</a>  set of topics down and simplifying it for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2374.357s">I</a>  would personally be of the mind that I do want to engage in the rating exercise, but I fully agree that it can be done offline. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2385.059s">And</a>  perhaps there could be a motion to do that before the next meeting, before this has ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2391.02s">What</a>  I would like to ask you is in terms of these <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2396.141s">general</a>  topics that you've seen from the comprehensive plan and the cap plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2400.244s">And</a>  I do understand that there are certain things that are very broad and there's certain things, like you said, the heating that were very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2409.11s">What</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2410.515s">very,</a>  and it's going to be very difficult for y'all to come up with something that can integrate all of the themes from both of these into one comprehensive zoning plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2423.619s">What,</a>  from your impressions, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2428.789s">could</a>  there really be, do you really see there being like contradictions when you're actually trying to implement these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2437.457s">So</a>  if, you know, there is, could be, you know, there could be a need for better transportation, there could be a need for more affordable housing, there could be a need to <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2453.112s">make</a>  buildings more energy efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2456.074s">Do</a>  you see any of these things in a single zoning plan strongly contradicting each other when you really get down to the nitty gritty? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2468.323s">I'd</a>  like to hear your general thoughts on that.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2472.706s">So</a>  to be honest, no, I think that this is very well done. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2476.009s">The</a>  CAP and the COMP plan are very well done plans <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2480.902s">And</a>  I think that these things actually help each other, so that when you actually do one goal, you're actually helping the others to also be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2491.927s">So</a>  maybe when you go to the very specific, we would have some contradictions, but I expect very minor things, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2501.721s">I</a>  think that this all works towards the same direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2505.223s">And</a>  that's what I see from the cap, from the comp plan and both together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2509.645s">There</a>  is a lot of overlap because they have the very similar goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2516.529s">So</a>  at the moment, nothing has popped up that to me saying this really, this goes really both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2525.934s">No,</a>  I think that is everything that I've seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2529.116s">To</a>  be honest, it's been on the same <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2532.167s">and</a>  I think it's a very good path.</p>
