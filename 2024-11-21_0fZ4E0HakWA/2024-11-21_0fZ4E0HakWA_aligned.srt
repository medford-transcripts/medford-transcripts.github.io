1
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:12,334
Test one, two.

2
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:09,303
City Council and Committee of the Whole, November 20 2024 Mr please call the roll Council Callahan.

3
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:11,905
Vice President Collins is absent.

4
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,587
Council is always absent, Councilor Lemming.

5
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:17,550
Councilor Scarpelli present.

6
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:21,353
Councilor saying, President bears, present.

7
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,935
I present to absence meeting is called to order.

8
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:27,247
Action Discussions item 19-070.

9
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:30,629
This is by Vice President Collins and Councilor Callahan on the Tree Ordinance.

10
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:36,151
We have three drafts that we've been working on for quite a while as evidenced by the 19-070.

11
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:37,312
That stands for 2019.

12
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:37,872
So we have a

13
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:56,168
public updates to the public tree ordinance in the city ordinance is currently the discussion of the creation of a tree committee and the proposed private tree ordinance, which would be relative to zoning.

14
00:09:56,788 --> 00:10:01,970
We are joined today by our building commissioner, our DPW commissioner, representative of Trees Medford.

15
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:11,213
And I think I'm gonna turn it over to Councilor Callahan to talk through how we're going to move through this today, Councilor Callahan.

16
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,785
Oh, and before I said I do have to, I will read, or if trees meant for folks want to read their letter into the record.

17
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:25,072
At some point later in the meeting I will read into the record, the letter from trees Medford, and the letter that we received from former counselor.

18
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:30,202
Yeah, sorry.

19
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:31,203
Go ahead.

20
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:31,963
Thanks.

21
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:34,904
So I want to give a little brief history.

22
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:40,807
As President Perez mentioned, this was introduced by Councilor Knight in 2019, early in that year.

23
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:46,710
It also went to the Energy and Environment Committee later that year.

24
00:10:47,390 --> 00:11:00,278
In 2021, it was looked at by the zoning subcommittee, and they allowed the trees Medford volunteer organization in Medford to draft and submit revised ordinance.

25
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:01,539
Later in 2021 that came back.

26
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,785
And then in 2022, that ordinance was split into three parts.

27
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:10,529
And so those three parts are the ones that we'll be looking at today.

28
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,613
One creates a tree committee for the city.

29
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:17,717
One is about public shade trees.

30
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:22,722
And the third one is about private trees, trees on private property.

31
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:44,739
So because it's been so long and because there have been a number of changes made, our goals today are really to sort of get everyone up to speed, all the city councilors, the members of the staff, and everyone else up to speed on where these ordinances are at to

32
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:53,775
figure out what our next steps are, and to basically set when is the next time that we will be discussing these ordinances in committee.

33
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:55,722
So that's kind of the goals.

34
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:10,391
And on that note, I would love to have, I'm very excited that we have a wonderful group of volunteers here in the city from Trees Medford who have done a lot of work on this over the last couple of years.

35
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:22,979
And I know that they have a long history with this and they have offered to give a, they wrote a letter and if they wouldn't mind reading that in or I could read that for them.

36
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,171
or President Barrett's gonna be there for them.

37
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:35,274
But then after that, if we can maybe begin with the tree committee ordinance, and if they can give us a tiny introduction to the tree committee ordinance, that would be great.

38
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:38,615
So I don't know if they wanna go ahead and come up to the podium.

39
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:43,297
Thanks, I'm happy to read the letter, unless one of you guys wanna read the letter.

40
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,137
Go for it.

41
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:46,638
All right, great.

42
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:49,339
And then you'll share, after that, you'll share your screen.

43
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:54,058
Do you want to read the, that'd be great.

44
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:54,278
Yeah.

45
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:55,558
You wrote it.

46
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:58,539
So I feel like you'll have a better feel on it than I do.

47
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:01,300
Okay.

48
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,540
Do I need to say who I am?

49
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,420
Yes, please.

50
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,780
Name and address for the record, please.

51
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,961
Amanda Bowen, 57 Madison street.

52
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:07,141
Okay.

53
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:20,685
Attached, please find our suggested revisions to the three tree ordinance drafts presented at the Committee of the Whole meeting on the 11th of October in 2023.

54
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:24,526
We were asked to review them and provide comments and suggestions.

55
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:40,489
Discussion about the topic of trees will dovetail with the citywide tree inventory anticipated to be complete in the coming month, the urban forestry master plan currently in process, as well as the ongoing urgent need to protect and expand our citywide tree canopy.

56
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:42,766
Several points to highlight.

57
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:47,868
We have drafted these documents in collaboration with members of the Energy and Environment Committee.

58
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:54,271
We have based the documents on many existing tree preservation ordinances found in cities and towns in the area.

59
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:59,373
We welcome all efforts to revise the documents as the council and others see fit.

60
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:06,876
The private tree document establishes what constitutes a protected tree, as well as defining landmark trees.

61
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:11,324
The public tree document is intended to modify existing ordinances.

62
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:21,189
The private tree document includes guidelines for trees to be removed during construction, as well as those removals planned independent of construction.

63
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:29,374
Enforcement will be the responsibility of the building department in the former case and with the forestry department or the tree committee in the latter.

64
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:42,261
We intend for the tree committee to be able to help field tree permit applications, understanding that the duty suggested in the draft will be too time consuming to be handled by current forestry staff.

65
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:50,204
We have left specific mitigation fees and penalties to be established in the city's regular declaration of fees and fines.

66
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:57,967
For comparison, Cambridge's fee is $800 per inch with a steep discount for resident owners.

67
00:14:58,487 --> 00:14:58,968
Newton's is 168.

68
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:13,663
per inch, Arlington's is 500 per tree, Concord's is 375 per tree, Lexington's is 200 per inch, Marblehead's is 500 per two inch or 250 per inch.

69
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:24,894
We would also like to recommend that the city establishes requirements for tree contractors to be certified arborists, ISA preferred,

70
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:31,894
licensed and insured similar to other contractor requirements, such as electricians and plumbers and roofers.

71
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:38,619
This will help the city and residents with any tree removal projects to modify their tree canopy correctly.

72
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:44,763
These arborists will understand and be able to help homeowners with the new ordinance once it is in place.

73
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:48,325
Thank you, Amanda.

74
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:51,307
All right, I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

75
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:53,943
Thanks.

76
00:15:55,044 --> 00:16:00,249
So if we want to go ahead and start with the tree committee ordinance, I'm happy to share my screen.

77
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,473
What we have is a redlined version.

78
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:16,142
And Councilor Beres, can you go ahead and let us know for this redlined version, what are the different colors?

79
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:18,124
What are the things that are added or removed?

80
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:24,933
So I believe that the red indicates a comment that preexisted.

81
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:35,576
And this is the blue indicates changes from the KP law draft to the draft submitted by the trees, Medford folks.

82
00:16:37,116 --> 00:16:43,638
So blue is new and black is something that was submitted by KP for the October 11th, 2023 meeting.

83
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,680
So actually.

84
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,583
So the blue is all the stuff that you added.

85
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:00,965
Zach just did this.

86
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:03,627
He took your version, and he created a red line.

87
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,850
Because we can't look at the.

88
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,053
We just wanted to be able to see the difference between what you guys did and the KP law.

89
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,255
So the blue stuff is everything that you've added.

90
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:17,518
And then it should also show lined removals as well.

91
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:26,131
So I don't know exactly what we feel is the best way to go through this.

92
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,092
Generally, we go through section by section.

93
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:33,197
You can kind of note the changes, and then we can pause for further discussion.

94
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:33,777
Mm-hmm.

95
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,279
Do people want me to read it?

96
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,021
Should we just read it silently?

97
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,203
Should I read it out loud for your call?

98
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:47,789
I think summarizing the changes is generally what I like to do, but it's however you want to handle it.

99
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:48,069
Yeah.

100
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,270
I mean, I'm only just seeing this now.

101
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,533
I'm happy to do it, too.

102
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,635
I've done it a few times, if you want.

103
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:57,636
That would be great.

104
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:58,097
I'm sorry.

105
00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:58,457
Thank you.

106
00:17:58,597 --> 00:17:59,678
Yeah, totally.

107
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:12,108
So it looks like here we have in the purpose section, just looks like there's an edit to quality of the city's environment.

108
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:16,692
And then it looks like there's a quote or kind of a section, a paragraph added.

109
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:24,405
to summarize some changes under Mass General Law chapter 40A or authority provided under General Law 40A.

110
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:39,790
I think we should talk, we can talk about that further, but just that might, we might want to constrain that paragraph to the private ordinance since that's the one that's going to be a zoning ordinance, but we can talk about that.

111
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,051
And I'm interested to hear from building commissioner and the DPW commissioner.

112
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:58,221
Under the appointments section, we have the committee shall consist of five Medford residents and up to 10 members total, subject to confirmation by the Council and added two youth members.

113
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:00,943
It looks like a change from the last draft.

114
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:07,528
One member demonstrating expertise in the fields of urban forestry or landscape design.

115
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:11,411
Residency not required if requisite expertise is demonstrated.

116
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:30,548
And then there's just some minor changes to the initial terms, a few more minor changes to duties, but here under section 3A, it looks like there would be a differentiation with the creation of something called the landmark tree hearing.

117
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:42,131
Moving forward, it looks like some additional typographic and other language additions here in sections B,

118
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,342
through I, I'm not seeing anything super major.

119
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,225
Section J here.

120
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:56,669
I'm just going to pull up my draft because I'm not seeing what was removed.

121
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:09,777
It looks like a majority of this question under the duties has remained pretty consistent from the initial draft or from the draft from October 11, 2023 to now.

122
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:19,055
And I think that generally summarizes the changes.

123
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:23,596
I don't know if Amanda, if you want to talk any more about what changed between the two drafts.

124
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:24,956
Okay.

125
00:20:28,097 --> 00:20:28,297
Yeah.

126
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:41,101
So it looks like the main differences are around the composition of the trade committee and some questions around youth membership and residency.

127
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:45,383
At this point,

128
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:53,927
We could recognize either the DPW commissioner or the building commissioner if you have any comments on the tree committee ordinance.

129
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:03,576
President Behrs.

130
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:08,360
So I had a chance to review.

131
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:15,441
I think it's different from what you're looking at, but I believe maybe what you did there is based off of the document that was sent.

132
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:16,522
Yes, yes.

133
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,702
Okay.

134
00:21:18,763 --> 00:21:28,669
So, as far as Attorney Stein's comments, I agree with the comments that she made there in the right column, and then under duties.

135
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:38,193
I just had some concerns with duties that really already live in the DPW, and I don't want to create any dueling authorities.

136
00:21:39,153 --> 00:21:45,016
So it could just be changing language, for example, working with the tree warden in public tree hearings, including documentation of tree hearings.

137
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:51,699
Really, that should be done by the DPW, specifically the tree warden, really.

138
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:54,880
That would be a part of her duties to document the tree hearings.

139
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:58,842
Ensure the city adheres to provisions of master

140
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:07,396
That's the chapter that protects trees.

141
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:11,798
That is already under the authority of the tree warden.

142
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:17,640
So again, I don't want to have double authorities here, dual authorities.

143
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:23,903
Duties C, I think that is an advisory capacity.

144
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:32,606
But I just want to confirm that things like considerations of management of urban forestry environment as a whole, in particular neighbors, waterheads, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

145
00:22:35,202 --> 00:22:36,923
There's no authority there, it's just advisory.

146
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:49,934
D, working with tree warden and local groups to develop and recommend a community forest master management plan, community forest management plan, and adoption by the city council.

147
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:52,536
Again, that's just the responsibility of the DPW.

148
00:22:52,556 --> 00:22:55,819
Don't want to have competing authorities here.

149
00:22:56,431 --> 00:23:00,254
Working with the tree warden on an annual report of tree planting removal and maintenance activities.

150
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:05,218
I'm okay if this committee does that on their own, but that again is a responsibility of the DPW.

151
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,804
Jay, working with the outside groups in the DPW to develop, maintain, and use an inventory of existing public trees.

152
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:19,641
and forests, including historic and notable trees, in order to improve understanding management and protection of tree resources.

153
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:23,304
Again, wording, just working with the DPW.

154
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:25,786
It's DPW work.

155
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:28,228
I just don't want to make sure we have that clear.

156
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:31,711
And that was really it.

157
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:40,639
So besides that, I support this wholeheartedly, and I think the purpose is clear, to promote a diverse and healthy sustainable urban forest.

158
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:45,235
that will provide for the health, general welfare and quality of life of Medford citizens and the beauty and quality of the environment.

159
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:46,535
I think that's an excellent purpose.

160
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:48,795
Thank you, Commissioner McGivern.

161
00:23:48,815 --> 00:24:00,298
Yeah, and I know that Robin Stein comment on the duties at this section three will be relatively dependent on what actually happens with that public tree ordinance changes as well.

162
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:01,038
Absolutely.

163
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:05,579
And I think words like support and advisory are called for in a situation like this.

164
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:06,659
Got it.

165
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,419
Councilor Callahan.

166
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:10,607
Thank you.

167
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:25,963
Yeah, my only question is, I think that the intention is to provide help so that in case, you know, given the new ordinances, there is in fact more work to do that the tree committee might be able to help with that work.

168
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:32,710
So I just want to be, I want to get your input, like if the language has changed to be like,

169
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,993
you know, when needed, help support DPW in?

170
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:39,195
Like, would it be okay to include these things?

171
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:50,184
Yes, I just want to make sure that there's a clear delineation as to what is DPW's work and what is the Treat Committee's work, because the purpose of the Treat Committee doesn't support some of the duties that are listed.

172
00:24:50,804 --> 00:24:53,006
So it's a similar comment to what Attorney Stein is saying.

173
00:24:53,947 --> 00:25:01,313
And that's why I think language such as advisory or a supporting role, those types of language is fine, because from what I understand or preferable,

174
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:14,660
from what I understand, this isn't a committee like the Planning Board or the Zoning Board that has a defined authority that makes decisions like the Traffic Commission has a defined authority that makes decisions and those decisions are standing.

175
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:21,004
Nobody else in the city has those authorities, so we just want to make sure that we're not double dipping on authorities.

176
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:22,064
Great, thank you.

177
00:25:22,444 --> 00:25:27,527
And I think as Attorney Stein noted, you know, we're subject to the Chapter 87

178
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:31,585
mass general laws around those authorities.

179
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:43,949
And we can't, yeah, we just can't give away, like the Traffic Commission, for example, is actually defined by state law here, like the Medford Traffic Commission's authority.

180
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,330
So just like tree wood.

181
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,530
Yeah, exactly.

182
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,911
And that's my just the kind of point I'm trying to push home.

183
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:53,633
But yeah, it sounds like for the tree committee, generally,

184
00:25:54,969 --> 00:26:09,613
be mostly working with DPW, maybe some language tweaks would be needed around support and advice, but specifics, the public tree ordinance as we look at the amendments there is going to inform some of that for here for the tree committee as well.

185
00:26:09,953 --> 00:26:10,233
Excellent.

186
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:10,733
All right.

187
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:11,254
Thank you.

188
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:22,817
So maybe we can move to, well, we can, do we have any more comments on the tree committee ordinance either in person here or on Zoom before we move on to the public?

189
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:26,384
tree ordinance amendments.

190
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:27,206
Councilor Sang.

191
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,277
Thank you.

192
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:43,105
I think something just worth thinking about going into the future is the goal with the youth members, just because working with youth can be just more complex.

193
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:50,970
And so I think the question is, are we looking for young folks who are really interested in environmental matters?

194
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,772
Are we looking for just the general youth residents' perspective?

195
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:01,699
I think that will guide, that can help guide the language in this ordinance.

196
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:23,263
I think one way in which that might come about where we might see a situation where we have to deal with that is if the goal is to get young people who are really interested in the environment in, it might make sense to have some tough students who are residents or tough students get involved, but given how the dorms work, they might not be,

197
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:27,246
They might spend their whole day in Medford and not have a Medford address, right?

198
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:31,349
And I think that's just something for us to consider moving forward.

199
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:37,334
What is the goal and what support do they have in being integrated as part of the committee?

200
00:27:38,315 --> 00:27:39,336
Do they get training?

201
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:45,380
Who's helping ease them in or tell them what their job is?

202
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:48,983
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

203
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:52,366
And I will go to Councilor Skarpel.

204
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,771
Thank you, Councilor Baez.

205
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:58,093
And I think that I appreciate all the hard work everybody's done.

206
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:05,238
I know this has been a long time coming, and there's just a couple of concerns that residents have reached out to me about that couldn't make it to this meeting.

207
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:11,382
And I think that Commissioner McGiven helped with a lot of those questions.

208
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:21,309
I think that as honorable and as lucky as we are to have a committee of dedicated members of our community, I think that

209
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:41,685
really that there is some fear that having a community group making decisions that affect homeowners left some questions with our residents, but I appreciate the clear questions and definitions from Commissioner McGiven.

210
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:42,385
So thank you.

211
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,206
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

212
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:47,206
Councilor Calderon.

213
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:56,419
Yeah, I just wanted to mention the changes to the appointments and see if anyone had any comments on that.

214
00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:06,926
Sounds like, you know, five men for residence up to 10 total, two youth members, one who demonstrates expertise in the field of urban forestry and landscape design.

215
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:14,911
Just wanted to see if there were any comments on that particular portion since we didn't really, nobody really made any comments before we move on.

216
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,099
Seeing none at this time.

217
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:21,539
Great.

218
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:21,919
Thanks.

219
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:22,440
Thanks.

220
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:24,381
All right.

221
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:28,664
Let's move next to our public tree draft.

222
00:29:30,785 --> 00:29:32,106
If you wouldn't mind sharing that.

223
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:35,668
Maybe I don't know.

224
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:36,809
Maybe I can do it.

225
00:29:41,232 --> 00:29:41,532
Great.

226
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,771
Do you want to go for it?

227
00:29:48,391 --> 00:29:48,831
Sure.

228
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:49,332
All right, great.

229
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:53,794
Unless, are you interested in doing an intro to this one or no?

230
00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:01,439
I could just do a little bit of the purpose.

231
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:08,704
It does, this one is preserving, protecting public shade trees and trees otherwise located on public property.

232
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:15,101
And it is different from the third one, which is trees on private property.

233
00:30:16,663 --> 00:30:21,808
So it looks like, let me see if I can do a little bit about the changes.

234
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:29,055
Looks like there are some changes to the intent and purpose, adding something about MGL Chapter 40A.

235
00:30:31,777 --> 00:30:35,919
A paragraph about that and state legislature granting municipalities rights and responsibilities.

236
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:48,466
It does talk about establishing a tree fund to supplement the city budget for tree maintenance, tree planting, stump removal and site preparation for tree planting.

237
00:30:52,003 --> 00:31:01,150
A few changes in the definitions of caliper in terms of diameters of the tree trunks measured.

238
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:09,717
A few very small minor changes in construction and demolition.

239
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:16,863
Then this looks like more changes to the diameter at breast height.

240
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:28,409
Tree diameter in inches measured four and a half feet above the ground for multi stem trees size determined by the measure of all trunks, then adding the total diameter of largest trunk.

241
00:31:29,209 --> 00:31:38,998
A new definition of drip line the area directly under the tree at the outer circumference of the tree branches, where most the rainwater shed from the tree canopy drips to the ground.

242
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:45,441
Then also a new definition of a landmark tree.

243
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:50,585
Any healthy tree may be designated as a landmark tree if it meets one or more of the following criteria.

244
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:54,228
A, a tree that is documented to be 50 years old or older.

245
00:31:54,628 --> 00:31:57,710
B, is 24 inches in diameter or more at breast height.

246
00:31:58,471 --> 00:32:00,552
C, represents a rare species.

247
00:32:01,173 --> 00:32:05,717
D, is associated with a historical event or person, unusual feature, or scenic enhancement.

248
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:11,639
All landmark trees are protected trees, except those listed as invasive species on the Massachusetts Invasive Plants list.

249
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,401
Then a few very small changes.

250
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:18,742
A change to protective trees.

251
00:32:22,264 --> 00:32:27,986
The change to protective trees is accepting trees listed as invasive species on the Massachusetts Invasive Plants list.

252
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:39,375
Looks like a new definition of the tree fund, an account established pursuant to this ordinance for the deposit of payments for mitigating tree removal in lieu of tree replanting.

253
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:48,261
This fund may only be expended as a means of promoting a healthy tree canopy and will be applied to the cost of site preparation, tree replanting, and new tree maintenance.

254
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,862
And a few other very small changes.

255
00:32:54,944 --> 00:33:07,791
The tree warden has some some new language in it, which really is defined in saying as defined in GLC 87 S2 and Medford Ordinances 1974 Chapter 26 Section 2.

256
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:11,793
The tree warden is the city employee responsible for the management of city cities, public trees.

257
00:33:14,455 --> 00:33:18,617
Applicability these versions shall apply to the activities related to trees on public land.

258
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:22,522
Changes to tree permit.

259
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:37,934
In addition, if a public tree has fallen on a house resulting in damage to windows, puncturing roofs, or similar significant damage requiring immediate action, the homeowner may proceed to have the tree taken down after notifying the tree warden and no permit is necessary.

260
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:45,768
Also under that section of tree permit, city tree removal and replacement, a hearing process.

261
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:52,373
When the city removes a tree from the sidewalk strip, it must replace the tree within the next planting cycle unless the following procedures are followed.

262
00:33:52,974 --> 00:34:01,341
A, if a tree is cut down by the city and is not to be replaced in the next planting cycle, the city must hold a hearing and invite interested parties, tree groups, and residents within the city block to attend.

263
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:06,725
The hearing must provide the opportunity for community members to contest the decision not to replace the tree in a timely manner.

264
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:11,309
B, the decision must be announced on the city's website for one month prior to a hearing.

265
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:24,281
C, if the intention is not to replace the tree at all, one month prior to the hearing, the city must inform members of each residence within the city block in writing of their intention not to replace the tree and the reason why the city seeks to reduce the tree canopy in their neighborhood.

266
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:26,663
The city should plant with native trees wherever possible.

267
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,526
Removal of a public tree must include stump removal within 60 days of the tree removal.

268
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:34,950
If removal of a stump within 60 days is not possible, the city must inform residents of the date of removal.

269
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:41,652
And there are more changes under tree planting.

270
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:49,578
Promote an equitable and diverse urban tree canopy that provides adequate shade for all its neighborhoods.

271
00:34:50,078 --> 00:34:50,758
That's an addition.

272
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,182
Looks like a lot of changes under record keeping.

273
00:34:56,209 --> 00:35:00,671
The city will maintain an updated inventory of all public trees, tree removals, and stumps.

274
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:16,776
The tree warden shall keep a publicly available electronic record of removal requests, which shall include the species and size of trees to be removed, the reason for the removal, photographs of the trees documenting the reason for removal, the date, the contractors involved, and the name and address of the person who requests removal.

275
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:24,459
The city will maintain and make publicly available in electronic form an inventory of trees that includes tree and stump removals and new planting.

276
00:35:26,946 --> 00:35:28,649
New section protection of landmark trees.

277
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:36,079
The city shall make extra efforts to preserve landmark trees, including treating disease trees where feasible, enhancing pruning schedules and regular monitoring of the tree.

278
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,843
A landmark tree shall not be cut down or removed without a permit.

279
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:43,009
We are close to the end here under enforcement and penalties.

280
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:44,914
Two sections.

281
00:35:45,514 --> 00:35:47,535
Section A, citizen removal of a public tree.

282
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:53,437
Any person or entity damaging or removing a public tree without authority will be fined, and the fines will be deposited in the tree fund.

283
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:57,398
Enforcement shall be by the tree warden or the tree warden's designee or the police.

284
00:35:58,018 --> 00:36:00,779
Citizens may report damage or removal of public trees to the tree warden.

285
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,920
Section B, penalties.

286
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:13,365
Any person who violates any section of this ordinance or violates any stipulation of a permit issued pursuant to this ordinance shall be fined and the fine shall consist of the cost of compensating the city for the cost of replacing the canopy that was lost.

287
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:23,028
This compensation shall be calculated by measuring the canopy cover used using recent aerial photography such as Google Maps cover coverage or aerial photography, determining the number

288
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:25,805
of young trees that would have the equivalent canopy coverage.

289
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:35,717
The fine shall be the sum of the cost of preparing the site, planting those young trees at the current contract rate, and salaries and costs for staff time for selecting, watering, and monitoring those trees.

290
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:39,842
So that is all of the additions and changes.

291
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,338
Do we want to have staff?

292
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:46,339
Yeah, thank you, Councilor Callahan.

293
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:46,960
Thank you.

294
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:50,002
It's pretty, some pretty significant changes.

295
00:36:50,022 --> 00:36:56,486
So I'm wondering, Commissioner McGivern, what your thoughts are and where we might want to go from here.

296
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:11,592
I don't think I, maybe the changes were made after the document that I received because the document that I have, it doesn't have anything under enforcement and penalties.

297
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:14,733
Anyway, I didn't hear a lot, but I think my comments are the same anyway.

298
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:29,399
My biggest thing, and I think many of the additions since I have read it contribute to this, forestry as it is now and DPW in general, it's not like we have extra resources.

299
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:31,640
And so this does add on,

300
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:35,602
staff time and work, it changes the way we do enforcement.

301
00:37:35,622 --> 00:37:39,903
I heard there at the end, we do do enforcement now, but we don't do it that way.

302
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:42,764
And then the way we keep inventory.

303
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:49,126
One of my major concerns here is something I want anyway, which is to maintain an inventory of trees.

304
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,947
This ordinance would actually require us to do that.

305
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:54,148
But unfortunately we have one GIS person.

306
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:57,309
So, you know, one of the things that

307
00:37:58,573 --> 00:38:05,883
needs to be advocated for is a right sizing effort if this is to be taken seriously and actually executed seriously.

308
00:38:06,804 --> 00:38:15,215
I don't think one GIS person plus one tree warden plus one relatively small forestry team

309
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:21,701
plus the admin of the DPW can realistically manage this increase in work.

310
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:34,292
So I would recommend an FTE analysis be done on this ordinance to determine how many staff people in FTEs would need to be added to the DPW to successfully support it.

311
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,355
So that's one of my biggest comments here.

312
00:38:38,036 --> 00:38:38,196
Then

313
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:47,313
Funding, the fund, it seems to be established in the public tree ordinance, but is funded through the private tree ordinance.

314
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:51,014
So just a question as to why that's the case.

315
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:59,777
Oh, yeah, there's a reference.

316
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:04,764
There's a reference in here to a non-existent plan.

317
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:07,326
Yeah, the community forest master plan.

318
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,408
It will exist in the future.

319
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:12,511
It won't be called that, but there will be something there.

320
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:15,253
I just don't want to hold us to something that doesn't exist.

321
00:39:17,615 --> 00:39:25,202
And then I would also like an opportunity to, and maybe I missed something, but to review the additional language that has been added.

322
00:39:26,623 --> 00:39:26,883
Thank you.

323
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:28,585
Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.

324
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:36,725
Yeah, I think we're going to need to have this track changes draft brought to you probably to KP as well.

325
00:39:37,005 --> 00:39:42,911
I think there's some comments from Attorney Stein around enforcement in here already, but I'm going to go to Councilor Scarpa.

326
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,412
Councilors, thank you so much.

327
00:39:48,472 --> 00:40:00,107
And please forgive me, I was hoping, I know that we might, I guess we had a glitch early in the meeting, so I have to pop out again in a few minutes to shut down a program.

328
00:40:01,843 --> 00:40:06,427
I just wanted to, if I can jump in a little bit early, just to give some comments, if that's okay, President Bez.

329
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:07,928
Go ahead.

330
00:40:08,048 --> 00:40:08,228
Yes.

331
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:09,349
Councilor Scarpelli, go ahead.

332
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:11,691
I appreciate Commissioner McGiven.

333
00:40:11,731 --> 00:40:13,853
I think that's kind of the questions that I had.

334
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:29,385
Also with former Commissioner Forte, we really had some in-depth conversation with him and his vision with what he saw as the enforcement piece as we moved, especially to the private protection piece.

335
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:37,989
And I think that in my situation, I do think that this is a lot of work and there's a lot of work that was done.

336
00:40:38,009 --> 00:40:51,139
There were so many changes that I hope that we do move on to another meeting with our city department heads because I think it's important that we do do a cost analysis and especially moving into the next budget season.

337
00:40:51,679 --> 00:41:01,506
with all the new money we have looking into bringing qualified professionals into departments that can handle such a task.

338
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:15,756
I think what I'm hearing is, and I won't speak for Commissioner McGiven, but it sounds like this will really overwhelm our existing team in comparison to what they're already doing today.

339
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,416
And then

340
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:24,721
I know that I had a brief discussion with the building commission today was great and he's ready to do everything and anything possible.

341
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:33,325
But as you look at the private tree protection, I think 1 of the biggest concerns that we had starting a few years ago is really.

342
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:39,967
um, having government come in and tell residents what they can do on their own property.

343
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:44,668
Now, and this isn't this, this doesn't affect thousands of trees.

344
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:55,431
I don't think this affects many trees, but I think it does affect the quality of life and the expectations of homeowners that might want to, um, you know, you know,

345
00:41:56,326 --> 00:42:01,070
We have some I have to be very careful with my ethics when we talk about solar.

346
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,112
So I'm going to leave that to the side.

347
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:05,574
But there's some questions the other residents had.

348
00:42:06,535 --> 00:42:10,679
But I think that I think Attorney Stein did put in

349
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:15,900
uh, some legal pieces when it came into the opinion of subject of challenge.

350
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:30,727
Um, if we wrote in an ordinance and making some of these changes to the private, uh, tree protection plan, I think that, uh, that that might be again, that's something we talked about in the past and many, many meetings about being a slippery slope.

351
00:42:30,787 --> 00:42:33,289
I know that the former commissioner, um,

352
00:42:35,194 --> 00:42:45,481
uh, uh, Forte really had a plan in place that he was willing to share with us that is used in neighboring communities that really didn't affect most members of our community.

353
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:49,364
I fully support when we talk about new development.

354
00:42:49,884 --> 00:42:59,050
Uh, I fully support when we have people coming in and flipping houses and taking down trees to, to, uh, find a way to mitigate that with the tree fund.

355
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,651
I think that's a superb idea.

356
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:04,714
And I think that's something that will really benefit moving forward with, um,

357
00:43:05,454 --> 00:43:06,935
taking care of our tree canopy.

358
00:43:06,975 --> 00:43:07,976
I think that's so important.

359
00:43:07,996 --> 00:43:26,428
But, um, again, I think there are still so many questions when it comes to the price, especially the private piece and the implementation pieces with either the DPW and their tree service team and, um, the building commissioner and his team when it comes to, um,

360
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:34,939
moving forward with any of these added duties with the tree process.

361
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:39,242
So again, I apologize for leaving early.

362
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:50,509
I appreciate you allowing me, Council President, to share the concerns that was offered to me from some residents and historically what we've been talking about for many, many years.

363
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:52,410
I do wanna see this move forward.

364
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:55,834
Um, in any way, try to hold this back.

365
00:43:55,894 --> 00:44:08,966
I think that we have so many great ideas, and I think that, uh, our volunteers did a great job to help design and and craft an ordinance that really has some meat on it.

366
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:12,510
But I think with a lot of these red line changes, um,

367
00:44:13,928 --> 00:44:34,633
A lot of people were confused as well in what was happening and we're a little nervous about there'll be a vote tonight, but I do think this is a good piece to, you know, my recommendation, move this to another meeting and bring all the city staff with some, after they've revisited all of these changes and put together a plan on how we could really make this work.

368
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:39,215
So again, I thank everybody and I apologize for my dismissal, Mr. President.

369
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:46,843
Thank you, Councilor Scarbelli and appreciate your comments.

370
00:44:47,744 --> 00:44:55,051
I definitely think that a next step out of this meeting is going to be to refer these two relevant department heads.

371
00:44:55,111 --> 00:45:03,739
I think for the public tree ordinance going to the DPW, for the private tree ordinance going to both our building commissioner, as well as the, it's a zoning ordinance.

372
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:08,423
So what its interfaces with the zoning updates project that we're working on, I think is going to be important.

373
00:45:09,544 --> 00:45:17,088
and that three committee ordinance is going to be relatively determinant based on where we land on this public ordinance.

374
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:23,831
Okay, I thank you and I now leave the meeting so you can speed up your half and not waiting on roll calls, Mr. President.

375
00:45:24,192 --> 00:45:24,812
So thank you.

376
00:45:25,312 --> 00:45:27,213
Thank you and good luck.

377
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:28,514
All right, thanks buddy.

378
00:45:33,336 --> 00:45:34,217
Great, so

379
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:42,118
With that, do we want to take a look at the private ordinance then we can look at some motions or I'll go to you Councilor Kelly at first.

380
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:51,757
I just figured before we leave this one, it sounds like we want this to go to department heads for their feedback.

381
00:45:52,678 --> 00:45:57,182
Do we want to wait and have that feedback first before we send it to KPLI?

382
00:45:57,322 --> 00:45:59,183
I assume we do, because there might be some changes.

383
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:02,426
Do we want to have a cost analysis done?

384
00:46:02,607 --> 00:46:05,990
Or should we have those?

385
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:08,432
I just want to have a better sense of our plan.

386
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:12,847
what the different steps are that we need.

387
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:15,690
Because I think a cost analysis was mentioned.

388
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,253
KP Law, I think, as the last step.

389
00:46:20,735 --> 00:46:21,616
Yeah.

390
00:46:22,256 --> 00:46:27,701
First, Scott, do you see any engagement from your office on the public tree ordinance?

391
00:46:28,642 --> 00:46:28,903
OK.

392
00:46:29,643 --> 00:46:31,565
And Tim, do you think that

393
00:46:33,783 --> 00:46:37,244
you know, obviously your comments on this draft are gonna be incredibly important.

394
00:46:37,304 --> 00:46:43,385
Do you think that you could do some sort of kind of cost estimate as to what you think trying to fully implement this would look like?

395
00:46:43,405 --> 00:46:46,806
I don't know, or general estimate.

396
00:46:46,826 --> 00:46:48,366
Yeah, I think so.

397
00:46:48,426 --> 00:46:56,048
I did before on an earlier version, I think I came up with like 1.5 or something like that, FTEs to really be successful.

398
00:46:56,368 --> 00:47:02,970
And just to clarify, because Councilor Scarpelli paraphrased what I said, I think that I'm much more along the lines of

399
00:47:05,884 --> 00:47:10,206
supporting the efforts, but making it successful as possible.

400
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:15,008
So I think the way it's written now, it just won't be as successful as written.

401
00:47:16,028 --> 00:47:17,169
That's really the point I was trying to make.

402
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:44,890
great thank you yeah and I really think it's important at this point to just note I think there's two tracks generally here if the public ordinance public tree ordinance and the tree committee mostly assisting dpw with public trees and that's what the dpw then you have the private tree ordinance and that's going to be a zoning related related to the planning department our zoning project and likely enforced by the building department so I just think we should try to keep those

403
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,821
in track.

404
00:47:46,921 --> 00:48:02,590
So if you wanted to move on a motion here on the public to refer this public tree ordinance draft with these track changes and the tree committee ordinance with these track changes to the DPW, I think that would make sense.

405
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,951
We can get that cost estimate, right?

406
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:07,652
So I think that'll be the motion for that.

407
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,776
Let me know what you have, Mr. Clerk.

408
00:48:15,385 --> 00:48:16,765
And then, yeah, I guess it makes sense.

409
00:48:16,805 --> 00:48:27,128
We could come back for another meeting once we've heard some from Tim and then go to send this to KP and then have a final meeting, hopefully.

410
00:48:27,148 --> 00:48:29,168
So there'll be two more meetings on this before report out.

411
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:34,150
And this, you know, yeah.

412
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,831
They're going to Tim.

413
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:45,732
And Aggie, DPW forestry, DPW commissioner and DPW forestry.

414
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:49,256
However you want to handle that is obviously it's your department.

415
00:48:50,257 --> 00:48:50,997
Just me is fine.

416
00:48:51,318 --> 00:48:52,018
Just you is fine.

417
00:48:52,078 --> 00:48:52,299
Great.

418
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:53,700
So just the DPW commissioner.

419
00:48:57,724 --> 00:49:02,869
Councilor Callahan moved to refer the tree committee ordinance and the public tree ordinance to DPW commissioner McGibbon.

420
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:03,389
Yep.

421
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:05,852
For comment and a cost estimate.

422
00:49:05,872 --> 00:49:05,952
Yep.

423
00:49:07,754 --> 00:49:34,900
and uh tim when do you think we could maybe do you think meeting in january might be possible i think that's fine okay yeah january maybe add to the council work to schedule a further committee of the whole in january i just don't want to let this drop for 11 months 12 months like we did last time

424
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:38,803
Yeah, I'll go to them in a minute.

425
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:48,650
Yes.

426
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:51,092
Is there a second on that motion?

427
00:49:51,873 --> 00:49:53,053
Second by Councilor Sang.

428
00:49:56,176 --> 00:49:57,597
Yep, I'm going to go to discussion.

429
00:49:57,617 --> 00:50:00,119
I'm going to go to Loretta on Zoom.

430
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:01,400
Loretta, I'm going to unmute you.

431
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,942
If you could just provide your name and address for the record, please.

432
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:08,858
Oh, give me one second.

433
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:09,780
There you go.

434
00:50:10,701 --> 00:50:14,789
Hi, Loretta James Medford Energy Environment Committee, Sherman Place.

435
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:17,675
I had some questions.

436
00:50:17,835 --> 00:50:18,336
Can you hear me?

437
00:50:19,454 --> 00:50:20,255
Yes, we can hear you.

438
00:50:20,735 --> 00:50:21,135
Oh, good.

439
00:50:22,096 --> 00:50:22,996
I have some questions.

440
00:50:23,237 --> 00:50:28,420
I didn't quite, I understood what Tim said, but I just wanted to add some thoughts about this.

441
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:43,950
When we're talking about the budgeting concerns and all the changes, the idea was to have some kind of permitting process so that we can keep track of the tree canopy and also get grants from the state to plant more trees.

442
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:49,114
We can't keep track of the trees that are removed with some kind of permitting process.

443
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:52,836
we have no documentation.

444
00:50:54,637 --> 00:51:10,727
So whatever ends up happening, that's, you know, the key is to have some kind of permitting process where if that's free or not, is, you know, something to be determined, but it will help us keep track of the inventory that we have.

445
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:20,250
And the other concern, I was listening to what Tim was saying about DPW responsibilities and the committee having responsibilities.

446
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:29,412
The idea was that we're all aware that, you know, with the budgeting, that there's not enough help to implement a lot of these changes.

447
00:51:29,632 --> 00:51:41,574
That's why the tree committee wrote and took on, you know, I shouldn't say wrote, trees meant it wrote that the tree committee would be willing to do a lot of these tasks.

448
00:51:42,168 --> 00:51:45,289
to help with the cost of this budget.

449
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:49,569
So I just wanted to bring that up that there are many committees.

450
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:55,790
Well, I should say committees and commissions within the city that have these duties and do a lot of work.

451
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:06,472
And that was the idea of the tree committee that they would be able to assist to reduce the cost to DBW and to help the forestry department.

452
00:52:07,932 --> 00:52:09,393
So I hope you all keep that in mind.

453
00:52:11,363 --> 00:52:15,086
you know, people that are willing to help with these processes.

454
00:52:16,127 --> 00:52:23,793
And if that would be under DPW, I'm not sure, you know, the classification, but it was also to help, you know, the tree ward.

455
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:27,937
Thank you, that's all I have to comment on.

456
00:52:29,959 --> 00:52:30,579
Thank you, Loretta.

457
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:33,582
Any further comment?

458
00:52:33,602 --> 00:52:34,643
I will go to Lois.

459
00:52:35,743 --> 00:52:37,445
Lois, name and address for the record, please.

460
00:52:39,901 --> 00:52:43,022
Lois Grossman, 33 West Street, Medford.

461
00:52:44,263 --> 00:52:48,665
I'm on the Energy and Environment Committee with Loretta, as well as the Tree Committee.

462
00:52:49,665 --> 00:53:00,570
And it seems to me that you're dividing it into public trees, certain departments were mentioned that are relevant.

463
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:05,992
Private trees is gonna be more involved with zoning and so forth.

464
00:53:07,032 --> 00:53:08,133
But what about

465
00:53:09,164 --> 00:53:14,929
the tree committee itself, who was responsible for making that happen?

466
00:53:20,473 --> 00:53:31,503
It looked to me based on the draft, and anyone can feel free to quirk me here, that the tree committee would mainly be involved in supporting efforts around the public trees.

467
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:51,412
Um, and I think a lot of this has to do with the, um, enforcement authority and the ability, like the city's ability to regulate these questions coming from different parts of Massachusetts general law, um, with the public, basically general law, chapter 87, regulating public trees.

468
00:53:51,933 --> 00:53:59,117
And then the zoning state zoning law, chapter 40, a being what's relevant to the private, uh, property trees on private property.

469
00:54:00,038 --> 00:54:00,158
Um,

470
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:10,895
I'm trying to look here just in the duties of the tree committee advisory matters concerning Medford's trees.

471
00:54:10,975 --> 00:54:19,420
So this edit would bring some, I guess, some element of the private in here.

472
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,943
I think we just have to figure out what legal authority there is for that.

473
00:54:24,043 --> 00:54:26,705
But I would think that the tree committee would generally be working

474
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:30,365
mainly with the forestry department and the DPW.

475
00:54:31,405 --> 00:54:35,588
I'm not sure if any folks want to correct me, that's my reading of the intent.

476
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:44,753
But is that not the responsibility of the city council and the mayor to set up that committee?

477
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:53,538
Yes, the mayor would make appointments and the city council would confirm those appointments and then the committee would be staffed.

478
00:54:55,373 --> 00:54:58,916
the mayor would determine who would be staffing and supporting the committee's work.

479
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:15,188
I would strongly urge the members of the council and those present tonight to move forward with forming the tree committee independently of the duties.

480
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:21,293
Just the concept to say that there will be

481
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:32,450
committee and who the members are, and the details should be worked out with the other two major portions of this legislation.

482
00:55:34,392 --> 00:55:39,636
I would hate to see the committee get drowned in paperwork instead of appointed.

483
00:55:41,298 --> 00:55:41,698
Thank you.

484
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:43,560
Thank you, Lois.

485
00:55:48,536 --> 00:55:55,380
I was just going to contribute to this part of the conversation because a similar committee would be the bicycle advisory committee.

486
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:57,822
So I see this as an advisory committee.

487
00:55:57,882 --> 00:56:05,867
It's a promotional type committee that supports efforts that are happening in the DPW and possibly within zoning.

488
00:56:06,753 --> 00:56:24,517
So I think that once the ordinance is created for the committee and the appointments are made by this body and the mayor, typically these advisory type committees are run by the chairperson and almost act as an independent body, schedule themselves, create their own minutes, etc.

489
00:56:24,857 --> 00:56:27,378
And that would be the charge that the special employment

490
00:56:27,978 --> 00:56:43,106
by the city would have for them would be for them to operate themselves as a body and submit their recommendations to myself, for example, or the tree warden or the zoning officer, for example.

491
00:56:43,527 --> 00:56:47,509
So that's how it would probably most likely, I think, happen.

492
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:49,090
Thanks.

493
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,191
Thank you, Commissioner McIvern.

494
00:56:57,415 --> 00:57:04,261
All right, is there any further discussion on the motion from Councilor Callahan?

495
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:09,926
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

496
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:16,512
Councilor Callahan.

497
00:57:17,313 --> 00:57:18,674
Vice President Collins is absent.

498
00:57:19,635 --> 00:57:20,736
Councilor Lozaro is absent.

499
00:57:20,816 --> 00:57:21,336
Councilor Lemming.

500
00:57:22,337 --> 00:57:23,338
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

501
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:26,159
Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

502
00:57:26,379 --> 00:57:29,420
Yes, for the affirmative three absent, the motion passes.

503
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,581
Maybe we can move into the private tree item.

504
00:57:47,504 --> 00:57:48,084
One second.

505
00:57:49,437 --> 00:57:50,539
There you go, Councilor Callahan.

506
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:51,139
Thank you.

507
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:59,551
So again, the purpose of this is to protect specified trees on private property in the City of Medford.

508
00:58:00,793 --> 00:58:04,357
I will just go through some of the changes that have been made since the last draft.

509
00:58:06,219 --> 00:58:09,240
In the intent and purpose, it does add a last sentence to the first paragraph.

510
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,701
Medford's current tree canopy stands at 29%.

511
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:16,903
Protecting and increasing trees on private property is one way to protect tree canopy.

512
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:20,344
No trees shall be removed except in accordance with this ordinance.

513
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:32,968
And then there's another added paragraph similar to the public tree ordinance saying state legislature has granted municipalities the right and responsibility, blah, blah, blah, and quoting MGL chapter 40A.

514
00:58:35,455 --> 00:58:37,576
There are some changes in the definitions.

515
00:58:38,757 --> 00:58:44,599
Under Caliper, again, some changes similar to those in the public tree ordinance.

516
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:55,664
Definition of certified arborist, a professional arborist possessing current certification issued by the International Society of Arboriculture and or the Massachusetts Arborist Association.

517
00:58:57,484 --> 00:59:00,906
Definition for code enforcement officer, the building commissioner or designee.

518
00:59:01,926 --> 00:59:09,651
Definition for construction construction permit, a building permit issued by the building department allowing construction demolition or renovation of buildings and structures on a parcel of land.

519
00:59:10,783 --> 00:59:12,785
Some tiny changes to definition of construction.

520
00:59:13,505 --> 00:59:24,172
A new definition for critical root zone, the minimum area beneath the canopy of a tree which must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival.

521
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:31,918
The critical root zone is represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk and extending outward towards the tree's dripline.

522
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,401
Small changes to demolition.

523
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:42,104
More changes to the diameter at breast height, which are similar to those in the public preordinance.

524
00:59:43,945 --> 00:59:52,909
Definition for developer, an individual or firm who purchases a property in order to improve, renovate, expand or demolish a structure with the purpose of reselling the property.

525
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:59,052
Again, the definition of drip line, same as from the public preordinance.

526
01:00:01,207 --> 01:00:04,010
Some small changes to the definition of a hazardous tree.

527
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:12,038
Definition of a landmark tree, which is the same, I believe, as from the public one.

528
01:00:12,098 --> 01:00:22,948
Definition of landscape design plan, a written description and scale drawing of the future site that includes the locations of plantings, structures, hardscape, green space, topography, and future canopy.

529
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:26,091
A handwritten drawing is acceptable accompanied by photographs.

530
01:00:28,821 --> 01:00:32,383
small changes to the definition of Medford Tree Committee and person.

531
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:34,924
Protected tree.

532
01:00:34,944 --> 01:00:44,309
Any tree on private property with a diameter at breast height of eight inches or more, or a multi-stem tree having an aggregate of 24 inches or more.

533
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:53,353
Species that have a small height at maturity or are slow growing, such as flowering dogwood or American holly, with a DBH of six inches or more are eligible to be considered protected trees.

534
01:00:53,934 --> 01:00:56,375
Trees listed as invasive species on the Massachusetts Invasive

535
01:00:57,095 --> 01:00:59,596
Plants list are not considered protected trees.

536
01:00:59,616 --> 01:01:04,958
A few changes to the definition of replacement trees.

537
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:11,001
The trees must be a minimum of three inch caliber and a minimum height of six feet.

538
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:14,235
It again mentions the tree fund.

539
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:25,380
It has tree protection, replacement and mitigation plan, a site plan drawn and stamped by a certified land surveyor or engineer and stamped by a certified arborist or landscape architect.

540
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:38,947
It must show all protected trees as defined herein, including public shade trees near the property and must indicate which protected trees will be retained or removed and how critical root zones of each protected tree and public shade tree will be protected from damage during site work.

541
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:49,372
Tree removal application process and forms required to be used by any person as defined here in seeking to remove a protected tree.

542
01:01:49,392 --> 01:01:51,635
The $100 fee must accompany the application.

543
01:01:52,036 --> 01:01:54,619
The fee will be $35 for owner occupied properties.

544
01:01:56,602 --> 01:01:57,764
Tree removal permit.

545
01:01:58,499 --> 01:02:03,483
a permit issued by the building department for removal of trees based on the appropriate application process on privately owned property.

546
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:15,912
In addition to the actual cutting down of living trees, quote, removal includes any act that A, has caused a protected tree to die within the previous 12 months, or B, is likely to cause significant decline or death within a three year period.

547
01:02:18,354 --> 01:02:23,998
One sentence added to tree warden, the duties of the tree warden are redefined in this ordinance to include private trees.

548
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:31,891
And then there are a lot of additions here under applicability.

549
01:02:34,254 --> 01:02:37,417
These versions shall apply to the following activities on privately owned land.

550
01:02:37,437 --> 01:02:39,900
Do you want me to read this whole thing?

551
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,660
There's a lot.

552
01:02:42,322 --> 01:02:43,503
There's pages of

553
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:50,673
pages, yeah, if you wanna go ahead and give us a little overview.

554
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:59,497
We spoke to Anna yesterday about the possibility, sorry, of us doing a rethink of this document to make it simpler.

555
01:03:00,017 --> 01:03:10,462
We think that there are ways that we can, we've got an awful lot in here and we packed everything in that everybody suggested to us and it's too complicated to really be viable.

556
01:03:10,962 --> 01:03:12,223
and to enact.

557
01:03:12,603 --> 01:03:20,769
So we would like to sort of pull back and take a little bit longer to try and simplify this document.

558
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:36,380
But you should tell us what the best way to document how things change so that you, Zach Beers, don't have to go through this like you had to last night or whenever you did it, because you shouldn't have to do that.

559
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:39,282
At any rate, thank you.

560
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:44,167
I will, I will appreciate the credit, but I was able to use technology.

561
01:03:44,207 --> 01:03:45,448
It took me like 15 minutes.

562
01:03:45,528 --> 01:03:47,330
So yeah, 10.

563
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,532
I did it right here before we started.

564
01:03:49,612 --> 01:03:53,556
So, but I appreciate that you think I did more work than I did.

565
01:03:55,178 --> 01:04:00,963
I think just if I could comment really quickly, you know, I don't know,

566
01:04:02,369 --> 01:04:05,672
I don't know exactly where all of these came from.

567
01:04:06,453 --> 01:04:10,437
I'm guessing it's from the ordinances that you cited in the letter, some different pieces of different pieces.

568
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:14,901
I do want to go to Scott and then maybe to Tim.

569
01:04:15,802 --> 01:04:21,387
But my general understanding is the tree warden generally isn't involved in the private sector regulatory realm and

570
01:04:23,396 --> 01:04:27,079
zoning enforcement is subject of the building department and code enforcement.

571
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:39,348
So my suggestion is it might be worth sitting down outside of a public meeting with the building department, maybe making a decision not to include tree warden and DPW, and maybe that's a step forward.

572
01:04:39,368 --> 01:04:44,672
You can come up with something there, but I do want to give Scott a chance to talk before we move forward on anything.

573
01:04:47,034 --> 01:04:47,795
If you have anything to say.

574
01:04:49,721 --> 01:05:00,201
What do you mean, Commissioner vandal I admit I'm a little bit of a disadvantage having just become online with this within the last few days and I've been trying to understand it with the red lines and the side comments and all that stuff.

575
01:05:03,013 --> 01:05:07,734
We're certainly willing to enforce to the best of our ability whatever does get passed.

576
01:05:08,895 --> 01:05:17,117
I do think I see some potential challenges in the complexion of it, some challenges in the enforcement capacities to do that.

577
01:05:18,178 --> 01:05:22,339
We don't have a tree warden on staff and we don't have a forestry person.

578
01:05:22,359 --> 01:05:24,579
We're used to dealing with trees when they've become two by fours.

579
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,360
So this would be a new challenge for us to take on.

580
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,201
It would probably require some education.

581
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:42,607
There's a lot of reading and conversation I think still needs to be had to better understand what is expected of us and how we're going to be able to enforce this satisfactorily and understand the complexities.

582
01:05:43,488 --> 01:05:47,910
Because it is zoning, it does have a different enforcement process potentially has to go through.

583
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:50,912
We're sort of regulated by state law in a different way.

584
01:05:50,932 --> 01:05:59,576
And I think there's still some work to be done and I need to understand more of it as I listen in and I have conversations with folks about it.

585
01:06:03,077 --> 01:06:03,977
Thank you, commissioner.

586
01:06:03,997 --> 01:06:04,658
I appreciate it.

587
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,358
I'm sorry for not recognizing you as commissioner.

588
01:06:07,378 --> 01:06:13,520
I'm going to just open it up to discussion.

589
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,241
Members of the council about path forward here.

590
01:06:23,502 --> 01:06:24,062
Any thoughts?

591
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:30,124
Councilor

592
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:35,377
Sure.

593
01:06:35,497 --> 01:06:44,083
I think that at this meeting, we're really kind of getting back up to speed with like what the purpose of this is, what some of the ideas are in it.

594
01:06:45,003 --> 01:06:55,690
It sounds like it does need some, you know, discussion with the building department of, you know, what we can and can't do, maybe some understanding of

595
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:05,824
how this can be covered by zoning and the building department, which I myself don't fully understand.

596
01:07:07,204 --> 01:07:18,808
And I'm curious about other cities, how they deal with this from a zoning perspective and a building department perspective to see how that is done in other cities.

597
01:07:18,828 --> 01:07:21,829
So I'd be interested in understanding a little bit more about that.

598
01:07:26,556 --> 01:07:29,357
I'm hoping that the next step might be to have a sit down.

599
01:07:29,377 --> 01:07:33,077
I'm happy to be involved with the building department.

600
01:07:34,038 --> 01:07:37,618
And I know Trees Medford has been incredibly generous with their time.

601
01:07:37,638 --> 01:07:49,481
And maybe we can all sit down and have an understanding, look at some other cities, discuss what's gonna be possible here in Medford as well.

602
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:51,122
Got it.

603
01:07:51,462 --> 01:07:53,142
I'm gonna go to Councilor Sanz.

604
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:55,245
Thank you.

605
01:07:55,645 --> 01:07:57,528
Um, I think the sit down makes a lot of sense.

606
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:04,698
Um, I do want to thank trees Medford for all the work that they've done on this, and I do think that they've put a lot of research into it.

607
01:08:05,138 --> 01:08:08,583
I think this is, you know, we're at the point where like.

608
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:15,606
The council's goal is to make sure that this is something that's actionable, that holds up legally as well.

609
01:08:15,626 --> 01:08:24,933
And because this affects zoning, it is very much a different process, requires a different level of engagement with the material.

610
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:30,397
And so I think if we can bring together

611
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:39,144
us and the department heads to have a sit down before we come back to the committee with another draft.

612
01:08:39,204 --> 01:08:40,465
I think that would be very, very helpful.

613
01:08:40,485 --> 01:08:43,648
I think my question would be, we mentioned

614
01:08:45,843 --> 01:08:49,504
or Theresa Bedford mentioned trimming it down a little bit.

615
01:08:49,545 --> 01:08:51,605
Does that happen before the sit-down happens?

616
01:08:52,665 --> 01:08:56,306
I think that should be up to you all to work on it.

617
01:08:56,407 --> 01:09:02,248
And again, I thank you, Councilor Kallion, for taking this on because this is a very complex ordinance.

618
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:03,569
It's very involved.

619
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:08,696
I think it's hard.

620
01:09:09,516 --> 01:09:15,841
I think it would be too presumptive to give specific feedback on lines in here right now.

621
01:09:16,222 --> 01:09:22,367
Given that sit down and to do that, to do that here right now.

622
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:26,430
I know that there was a letter sent in from former counselor night.

623
01:09:28,814 --> 01:09:38,031
that brought up some, I think, some pertinent points about how this intersects with our different climate goals and climate policies.

624
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:49,866
I wonder if the PDS department planning development sustainability would be helpful in helping us gather some resources and data on that.

625
01:09:50,146 --> 01:09:57,914
I've done a little bit of digging into how the solar panel question and the tree question intersects.

626
01:09:57,954 --> 01:09:58,394
There's some

627
01:09:59,335 --> 01:10:01,677
from a very cursory glance, some mixed research out there.

628
01:10:02,678 --> 01:10:11,286
And so I think the answer is somewhere in the middle of what's been proposed by the former counselor and what is here.

629
01:10:12,407 --> 01:10:20,734
But I think that's very much, let's let the experts talk it out and then come back, review it, have us be another pair of eyes on this.

630
01:10:21,315 --> 01:10:23,537
But again, thank you for your work.

631
01:10:23,597 --> 01:10:24,017
Thank you.

632
01:10:24,378 --> 01:10:25,539
I want to thank everyone

633
01:10:27,019 --> 01:10:35,689
and on the Energy and Environment Committee for bringing us this far on this and in pushing us to be more ambitious as well.

634
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:39,553
Councilor Callahan.

635
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:56,717
I just wanted to quick ask if at this stage, is there anything that we would want to ask of Innocent Associates in terms of their, you know, like, can they give us like a very general sense of like what people do in terms of zoning?

636
01:10:58,038 --> 01:11:08,146
And without even sending them this whole piece of paper, but maybe with the purpose of it and just say, hey, what do you recommend in terms of zoning?

637
01:11:09,347 --> 01:11:10,928
Or how would this piece fit into zoning?

638
01:11:11,869 --> 01:11:12,730
Or if we're too early for that?

639
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:20,596
I think it would make sense to involve the planning office and the NS Associates team

640
01:11:21,637 --> 01:11:34,101
who is working on the zoning update in a meeting between, I guess, you or you and Councilor Collins, Commissioner Vandewalle, and some folks from PDS and NS to kind of work through this.

641
01:11:34,121 --> 01:11:44,365
I know Attorney Silverstein could provide some guidance around the law without necessarily having to come up with a draft, send it to KP, get KP comments back.

642
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:53,274
but I think, yeah, I would suggest that that happened as kind of just a city meeting, a mini meeting of city staff.

643
01:11:53,914 --> 01:12:12,045
And then when you guys have been able to iron something out that can come back to us and maybe it's part of the zoning process, or maybe it's, you know, we keep, we probably want to keep considering these three papers together, but I'm not sure how it'll interface with the work that we're doing for the zoning.

644
01:12:12,425 --> 01:12:15,547
There's a pretty ambitious timeline and calendar there.

645
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:15,787
So,

646
01:12:18,049 --> 01:12:19,070
That would be my suggestion.

647
01:12:26,595 --> 01:12:27,415
Any further discussion?

648
01:12:27,435 --> 01:12:28,036
Councilor Kelly?

649
01:12:28,056 --> 01:12:29,937
I was just going to make a motion.

650
01:12:30,397 --> 01:12:32,159
Go ahead.

651
01:12:32,839 --> 01:12:45,688
I move that Vice President Collins and I work with Therese Medford and the staff to do a next draft and update of this that we will then bring back to Council.

652
01:12:48,251 --> 01:12:50,278
By staff, you mean the building commissioner and the planning department?

653
01:12:50,478 --> 01:12:50,599
Yes.

654
01:13:21,328 --> 01:13:22,408
Council, let me see if I captured this.

655
01:13:22,909 --> 01:13:29,351
Councilor Callahan moved that she and Vice President Collins work with Trees Medford and city staff and work on the next draft and update of this ordinance.

656
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:32,572
And then to bring that draft back to an upcoming meeting of this committee.

657
01:13:38,075 --> 01:13:38,295
Okay.

658
01:13:41,456 --> 01:13:43,617
Thanks.

659
01:13:46,138 --> 01:13:49,319
On the motion of Councilor Callahan, seconded by.

660
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,181
Councillor Lemming.

661
01:13:52,321 --> 01:13:54,482
Any further discussion by members of the Council?

662
01:13:57,345 --> 01:13:59,046
Any further discussion by members of the public?

663
01:14:01,508 --> 01:14:04,270
I'm just going to add in, come to the podium, yes.

664
01:14:07,452 --> 01:14:08,473
Name and address for the record, please.

665
01:14:09,033 --> 01:14:12,055
I'm Sarah Gerald, 29 Burbank Road, Medford.

666
01:14:13,196 --> 01:14:19,960
So the motion you just did was for the private tree ordinance.

667
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,963
You've made a motion for the tree committee and the private tree.

668
01:14:25,564 --> 01:14:27,545
And what about the public tree?

669
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:30,747
The first motion was for the public and the tree committee.

670
01:14:30,807 --> 01:14:31,067
Oh, OK.

671
01:14:31,127 --> 01:14:32,028
All right.

672
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:32,488
Thanks.

673
01:14:37,643 --> 01:14:38,804
Any further discussion?

674
01:14:38,824 --> 01:14:40,786
I have Kim on Zoom.

675
01:14:40,847 --> 01:14:42,188
Kim, I will recognize you.

676
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,529
Name and address for the record, please.

677
01:14:46,573 --> 01:14:48,915
Yes, Kim DeAndre, 54 Canal Street.

678
01:14:49,956 --> 01:14:52,379
I just wanted to put out the idea of

679
01:14:53,413 --> 01:14:59,198
When people meet, we might be able to invite a representative of one of our neighboring communities.

680
01:14:59,858 --> 01:15:11,888
I know the private tree ordinance is the most challenging of the three, but we could benefit from in-person talking with some people from these other communities.

681
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:19,274
The commissioners, you know, a representative of some of the commissioners in the other communities might be very useful, just that.

682
01:15:22,281 --> 01:15:24,022
Thank you, yeah, I appreciate that comment.

683
01:15:24,183 --> 01:15:32,669
And I'm seeing a nod from Councilor Callahan, maybe that you could work with Councilor Collins and the other folks to entries meant for to invite someone.

684
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:34,110
Great.

685
01:15:35,692 --> 01:15:36,032
Awesome.

686
01:15:38,094 --> 01:15:43,258
On the motion of Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lemming, all those in favor?

687
01:15:43,898 --> 01:15:43,958
Aye.

688
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:44,719
Opposed?

689
01:15:44,799 --> 01:15:45,459
Motion passes.

690
01:15:47,981 --> 01:15:49,703
Any further discussion on this topic at this time?

691
01:15:50,862 --> 01:15:58,025
All right, I just wanna thank everybody for getting us re-centered with staff changes and everything else and council changes.

692
01:15:58,646 --> 01:16:02,247
I think we're in a good place now to move ahead.

693
01:16:02,287 --> 01:16:16,333
We have good next steps on each of the ordinances and hopefully we can come back in January for public trees and then we'll wait to hear back on the private tree from the group that's gonna be working on it on a timeline there, making sure it fits in with the zoning project.

694
01:16:18,715 --> 01:16:19,255
Any motions?

695
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:25,885
on the motion to adjourn by Councillor Callahan, seconded by Councillor Lemming.

696
01:16:26,405 --> 01:16:27,006
All those in favour?

697
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:28,008
Opposed?

698
01:16:28,068 --> 01:16:28,609
Motion passes.

699
01:16:28,629 --> 01:16:29,210
Meeting is adjourned.

700
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:29,530
Thank you.
