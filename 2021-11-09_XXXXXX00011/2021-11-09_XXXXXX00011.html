    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=4.982">Hey</a>  Medford Biceps listeners, I know I just announced that new episodes would come out weekly, but I wanted to release this episode early so that folks have time to be involved with Girls on the Run end of the season 5k. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=15.724">In</a>  this episode, I interview Aoife Mary, one of the Girls on the Run coaches. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=20.705">You'll</a>  also hear from some of the current Girls on the Run participants. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=23.846">There's</a>  information in the show notes about the 5k and how to sign up or volunteer, and just to get more information about the program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=30.507">Hope</a>  you enjoy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=37.685">Thanks</a>  so much for joining me today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=39.026">If</a>  you could just start by introducing yourself, your name, and your pronouns.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=42.57">Hello,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=43.511">My</a>  name is Aoife Mary, and I go by she, her.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=47.075">Great.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=47.315">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=48.576">So</a>  I know we're going to talk about girls on the run today, but before we get into that, I've been asking everybody about their favorite places to eat in Medford, what they like to eat there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=58.163">So</a>  we have a favorite place for treats on Saturday or Sunday morning, Donuts with a Difference. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=63.405">Oh</a>  my gosh, they're the best donuts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=66.106">Only</a>  thing is, there's always a queue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=67.887">You</a>  have to wait for them, so be prepared to wait, but they're well worth the wait. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=71.989">And</a>  I'm not gonna say there's any such thing as an Irish donut, but these are very comparable to the donuts you get at home. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=78.011">They're</a>  very light and fluffy and delish. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=80.792">And</a>  because they're so busy and so popular, they're always warm when you get them, and they're gorgeous. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=86.735">See</a>  that, Donuts with a Difference.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=87.895">That's</a>  a good one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=89.016">I</a>  know there's other places like Union Square Donuts that just do really fancy donuts, but the simpleness of the donuts with the difference in the freshness, that's what makes the difference.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=97.524">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=97.724">Some</a>  of the fancy ones are too dense. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=100.726">And</a>  don't get me wrong. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=101.347">People</a>  love them, and that's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=102.768">But</a>  I like a nice, light, fluffy one.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=105.591">Same,</a>  same. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=106.532">Good.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=106.712">Well,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=107.973">OK,</a>  so we wanted to hear a little bit about Girls on the Run. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=111.276">So</a>  if you could just tell us a little bit about the program.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=113.938">So</a>  Girls on the Run is an after school running program for girls through third through fifth grade. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=120.424">But</a>  it's, I always tell people, it's far more than a running program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=124.008">So</a>  it was developed in, started in North Carolina in 1996. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=130.013">This</a>  woman, Molly Barker is her name. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=132.234">And</a>  her background is in education and social work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=136.095">And</a>  she's like a three-time Ironwoman, which is pretty cool.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=139.836">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=140.717">So</a>  she kind of found the need in her community to start a program that was like specifically directed towards girls this age, right, 8 through 13. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=150.62">And</a>  through her research, she kind of found that those years, girls are still kind of receptive to adult influences. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=157.842">But</a>  they're also starting to feel like peer pressure and all that kind of stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=162.004">So</a>  she developed this program to be a bit positive influence and set some really good guidelines for them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=170.508">And</a>  she had 13 people in her first group. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=173.469">And</a>  now in 2021, the program has served over 2 million girls around the country. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=178.431">Yeah,</a>  really cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=180.072">And</a>  I think annually, the stats are like 200,000 girls a year enrolled. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=185.514">in</a>  over 200 cities across the country.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=188.576">Wow.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=189.176">So</a>  it's pretty awesome.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=190.517">Just</a>  had a 25th anniversary.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=192.498">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=193.578">On</a>  the 25th anniversary, we had served two million girls.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=198.18">Wow.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=198.441">That</a>  was like the marker. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=199.281">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=202.572">But</a>  when I say it's more than a running program, so it is a running program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=206.274">There's</a>  practice twice a week and we run at every practice and then the big event at the end is this big celebratory 5k that everyone, the goal is to complete it, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=218.319">So</a>  there's lots of running, but it's far more than that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=221.36">There's</a>  a really kind of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=223.701">There's</a>  a particular curriculum that we follow. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=226.142">It's</a>  really intentional. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=227.322">And</a>  it's all about social and emotional growth and positive behaviors, all of this kind of stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=234.365">It's</a>  really, really cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=235.145">PETE</a>  LEPAGE, JR.:</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=385.582">And</a>  you mentioned having two boys. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=388.205">So</a>  you probably have had conversations with them about the importance of you being involved in a program like this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=394.491">What</a>  are those conversations like?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=397.511">Yeah,</a>  so I think, first of all, I think it's really important to give back to the community, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=401.274">And</a>  so they know that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=403.376">Their</a>  dad coaches, he volunteers too, my husband, Ryan Murray. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=408.681">So</a>  it's part of the family, that's what you do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=410.743">When</a>  you can, you help out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=411.924">You</a>  go, you pick up the rubbish when it's rubbish picking up day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=415.847">buy</a>  a big good at the PTO sale, you make something, you just contribute however you can, whenever you can to your own community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=423.21">Because</a>  like in our minds, like you can contribute to the bigger picture. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=426.991">But</a>  if you're not helping out at home and trying to be a part of the small changes that are right in front of you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=433.413">You</a>  know, that's not as good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=435.415">And</a>  so we do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=435.975">We</a>  talk about it a lot because there are like, unfortunately, these like unconscious biases still. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=441.88">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=443.301">But</a>  part of Molly's program, when she started originally, she had this thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=448.105">She</a>  called it the girl box. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=450.106">And</a>  at that age, 8 to 13, is when we start to put ourselves or other people put us into the girl box, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=457.092">Well,</a>  you can't do that because you're a girl. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=459.134">Or</a>  you probably wouldn't want to do that because you're a girl. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=461.717">Or</a>  I definitely can't do that because I'm a girl. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=465.44">And</a>  so then you limit your capabilities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=468.302">You</a>  limit all of the possibilities for yourself as a young person or other people limit them for you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=475.429">And</a>  so the boys know that girls can do anything they can do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=479.292">But</a>  it also put, not just telling them, but I do it then, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=484.776">I</a>  do all of the things that you would think that a boy could only do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=490.32">So</a>  lead by example, you know? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=492.442">And</a>  then we have these conversations constantly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=494.303">And</a>  sometimes they don't even understand why a girl wouldn't be allowed to do something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=499.067">Like</a>  here in Boston, we have this history with the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=503.43">And</a>  when Catherine had her anniversary, we were watching. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=506.274">So</a>  the first woman to run the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=508.777">And</a>  we were watching the celebrations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=511.1">And</a>  they're like, why? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=511.781">We</a>  don't understand. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=512.361">Like,</a>  what's the anniversary of? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=513.843">Like,</a>  why was she not allowed to run previous to that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=516.907">And</a>  I was like, because girls weren't allowed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=519.17">And</a>  Connor legit was like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=521.012">But</a>  Parker, in my class, is so much faster than me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=523.694">It</a>  doesn't make any sense that she's a girl and he's a boy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=525.776">She's</a>  just as fast, so she should be allowed to run if she wants to run. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=529.219">So</a>  I think that we're really fortunate, Danielle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=531.902">Our</a>  generation is changing the way that we're raising our kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=535.705">And</a>  so then our kids are going to be <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=538.227">Like,</a>  don't get me wrong, I'm sure there's still going to be struggles, and there'll be fights to be had, and challenges ahead. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=544.012">But</a>  I think we're going to set them up for success in a way that some generations haven't beforehand, I would say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=552.278">Just</a>  build an awareness.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=555.501">Well,</a>  I think it's one thing to tell girls what we want them to be capable of or how we value them, but that has to be sort of across the board.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=563.604">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=564.744">The</a>  boys have to know, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=566.245">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=566.845">So</a>  when they see me, and like they do, Kian, not so much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=569.446">He's</a>  eight. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=570.446">He</a>  doesn't care as much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=571.467">But</a>  Connor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=573.628">was</a>  in third grade when he had third grade friends as part of the program, and fourth grade, and now he's in fifth grade. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=579.632">And</a>  so he'll ask me, what was the lesson today, Mom? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=581.794">And</a>  I'm like, oh, it was about gratitude. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=583.195">And</a>  here we go, and let's talk about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=584.756">And</a>  he's like, yeah, that's awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=586.677">That</a>  makes sense. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=587.658">It</a>  works for him, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=588.639">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=589.459">Yeah,</a>  it's good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=590.72">They</a>  love it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=591.1">And</a>  then they always come down to volunteer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=593.582">So</a>  yesterday, we had a practice 5K. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=595.423">So</a>  Ryan and the kids came. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=596.684">They</a>  stood on one of the crosswalks to make sure that when the girls were running, there's no traffic or whatever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=602.087">So</a>  they're intuitive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=603.087">They're</a>  supportive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=603.868">It's</a>  awesome.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=604.528">That's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=605.309">Great.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=605.689">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=605.969">And</a>  I'm wondering, has there been anything hard or a hard part about your role?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=611.322">So</a>  I don't find coaching is fine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=614.524">I</a>  have patience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=616.826">It's</a>  easy for me to be motivating and to keep it up and fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=621.108">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=621.769">I</a>  love coaching. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=623.129">I</a>  will say that every season when we start again, being a mom of two boys and mostly hanging out with the boys, when you get together and there's like 25 <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=634.091">young</a>  girls, the screaming. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=636.872">Like,</a>  there's so much screaming. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=639.273">And</a>  I always forget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=640.414">And</a>  I always am like, oh my God, why is there so much screaming? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=642.915">And</a>  then I remember, and it's fine. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=645.176">But</a>  it's just a different thing when you have 25 girls, especially at the beginning of a season. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=650.258">Because</a>  everyone's really excited, and there may be some new people that are nervous. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=653.759">So</a>  the energy is just kind of bananas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=657.321">And</a>  it's very screamy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=661.042">But</a>  that's the only thing, honestly, I'd like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=663.285">Every</a>  day at home, I'd have this practice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=665.027">It</a>  was awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=665.807">Let</a>  me tell you who did what. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=667.689">It's</a>  always a great experience.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=669.311">It's</a>  great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=669.952">Yeah,</a>  it's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=670.693">And</a>  what's been the most rewarding part for you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=673.939">Oh</a>  man, the rewarding parts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=676.2">There</a>  really is so many. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=678.962">And</a>  in no particular order, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=681.583">Firstly,</a>  on a personal level, it gives me the opportunity to connect with families that I may not cross paths with otherwise, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=691.708">So</a>  if you're not in the boys' class or their grade or play on their sports team, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=696.45">or</a>  if they don't play in the playground together or something, then there's a chance I may never meet you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=700.395">Do</a>  you know what I mean? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=701.556">So</a>  it's cool for me personally, like I get to connect with other people in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=705.08">I</a>  think that's awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=707.863">And</a>  then rewarding, like every day, these girls work a little bit harder. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=712.868">Whether</a>  it's running faster or not taking as many breaks <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=717.293">or</a>  like just contributing more in a group discussion or like remembering a lesson from the week before like every day you see growth and then at the end of the day when we have our celebratory 5k which we can talk about in a minute but like when these girls cross the finish line there is no better feeling in the world like they legit each and every one of them feels like a superstar and it's just incredible yeah yeah</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=742.381">I</a>  think running is so interesting like compared to other sports where there's like a real discipline and it's like you're almost like competing against yourself even though you're in a race but like my dad also he's a coach cross-country track and field and he would always talk about like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=757.507">his</a>  athletes being just really focused in lots of other ways and so there being these other benefits to to having running as a part of their life to think about a third grader running a 5k like i would have never like running for me as a kid was always like a punishment like you're late to practice you run laps or like you know yeah it was used as in that way and for to this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=775.574">to</a>  really be like the way to empower these girls. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=778.035">It's</a>  a nice reframe.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=779.935">Oh,</a>  it's awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=780.635">And</a>  like some of the girls this season are like third graders, like maybe just eight, you know, maybe they won't be nine until, like Mike Kean is eight, he won't be nine until next July.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=789.597">You</a>  know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=790.297">So</a>  they're only turning eight. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=791.938">And</a>  they're killing it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=792.698">Yeah,</a>  it's great.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=793.938">It's</a>  awesome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=993.885">Yeah,</a>  let's talk about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=995.206">So,</a>  November 20th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=996.027">We're</a>  really lucky because the 5K is being hosted in Medford at Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1003.115">So</a>  and it has a couple of years previous, it's been there and then we didn't do it in person with a big group during COVID, unfortunately. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1010.877">So</a>  this is like a big deal to have it back in person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1014.438">And</a>  it's all of the teams from the greater Boston area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1017.319">So</a>  there's going to be over 800 girls. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1019.88">running</a>  with their running buddy, so 1,600 people at least. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1023.844">Then</a>  there's coaches, there's grandparents, it's going to be so fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1028.688">And</a>  the girls get there in the morning, we all have a team t-shirt, right, which is great, and every girl is number one, which is really cool, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1037.035">And</a>  so you get there, and there's a DJ, there's music, there's balloons. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1041.476">It's</a>  so festive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1043.297">And</a>  just to point out to you, I know you said earlier when you were talking about being focused and running in a race, you're running against yourself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1051.078">This</a>  is, just to be clear, it's non-competitive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1055.24">It's</a>  not about who's the fastest. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1056.86">It's</a>  about completing your goal of how long you want it to take you to get there and crossing the finish line, doing the whole thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1065.402">And</a>  we do also have one woman who always crosses last and she's in a Wonder Woman costume. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1072.326">Therefore,</a>  no girl is ever last. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1074.287">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1074.667">No,</a>  there's no like last place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1076.288">Wonder</a>  Woman always finishes last, which is an awesome way to close it out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1080.25">But</a>  the girls, there's loads of like flair and glitter hairspray and glitter face paints and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1090.262">A</a>  lot more screaming. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1091.864">It</a>  was so fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1093.225">Everyone's</a>  so excited. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1094.987">And</a>  when they go out, like when the girls cross over, like I said, every single one of them comes back in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1100.213">We</a>  have 27 girls on our team this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1102.416">Every</a>  one of them feeling like an absolute superstar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1105.559">Like,</a>  how rewarding is that? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1107.141">Like,</a>  the best feeling in the world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1109.203">And</a>  then when you think about it, like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1111.686">It's</a>  just such like for them, it's such a tangible understanding of like setting a goal, working hard towards it and completing a goal, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1120.232">Life</a>  skills like that's forever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1121.853">Do</a>  you know what I mean? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1122.954">It's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1123.534">And</a>  just their sense of accomplishment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1125.195">And</a>  they're all so proud of themselves and they're so proud of each other, you know, and they all like as soon as one crosses, they'll turn around and get ready to clap for the next one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1133.441">And</a>  that's brilliant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1134.782">It's</a>  a brilliant day out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1136.563">If</a>  you're here on November 20th, come to Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1140.364">You</a>  can cheer along the route, you can cheer at the stadium, you can get a feel for what it's all about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1145.565">And</a>  like I said, we're always looking for volunteers for that day too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1149.326">GirlsOnTheRun.org.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1150.346">Right,</a>  and I'll put that in our show notes too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1153.147">Oh</a>  yeah, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1153.787">Because</a>  I haven't said it enough.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1156.868">It's</a>  easy for me to remember now too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1159.957">So</a>  is there anything else that you wanted to add about Girls On The Run? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1162.96">So</a>  if I could go back to talking about the curriculum just for a minute to give folks a better idea of what it's all about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1170.287">So</a>  we have, each practice has a lesson attached to it, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1174.771">And</a>  they fall under this umbrella of what we call the five C's. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1178.214">So</a>  competence, confidence, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1181.377">connection,</a>  character, and caring. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1184.699">And</a>  so, like, the first few lessons are all about understanding, like, helping the girls understand their own core values and, like, what's important to them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1193.706">And</a>  then the middle few are about, like, teamwork and connection. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1197.769">And</a>  then the last few are about, like, community and how you can have a positive impact in your own community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1204.033">And</a>  the lessons are awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1205.214">They</a>  go from lessons on gratitude, on managing your emotions and being able to express your emotions, resolving conflict and resiliency. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1217.883">The</a>  lessons are awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1218.943">And</a>  they all line up to have this very positive influence on behaviors, habits, and life skills moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1229.671">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1231.412">That</a>  sounds great.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1315.321">My</a>  name is Kay Benowitz.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1317.442">What</a>  are your pronouns?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1321.722">And</a>  how old are you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1325.863">And</a>  what is your best memory about Girls on the Run so far?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1330.444">When</a>  I wrote my goal, 12 laps. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1335.845">And</a>  on Tuesday, I got 12. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1340.465">And</a>  then I practiced a little more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1344.666">And</a>  on Thursday, I really showed off. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1347.707">And</a>  I got 15. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1348.227">I</a>  was really excited.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1351.083">That's</a>  my best goal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1353.584">And</a>  then what advice might you give to a new girl coming on to Girls in the Room?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1359.945">I</a>  would say to keep your pace and to keep going, running, jogging, or walking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1367.747">And</a>  you should always have fun.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1370.328">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7bcsqNJiaqYksjHMmOblMh?t=1371.328">Thank</a>  you.</p>
