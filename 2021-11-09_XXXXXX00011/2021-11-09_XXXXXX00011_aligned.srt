00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:14,944
Hey Medford Biceps listeners, I know I just announced that new episodes would come out weekly, but I wanted to release this episode early so that folks have time to be involved with Girls on the Run end of the season 5k.

2
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,745
In this episode, I interview Aoife Mary, one of the Girls on the Run coaches.

3
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:23,345
You'll also hear from some of the current Girls on the Run participants.

4
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:29,967
There's information in the show notes about the 5k and how to sign up or volunteer, and just to get more information about the program.

5
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:31,007
Hope you enjoy.

6
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:39,006
Thanks so much for joining me today.

7
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:42,250
If you could just start by introducing yourself, your name, and your pronouns.

8
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,451
Hello, everybody.

9
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:46,634
My name is Aoife Mary, and I go by she, her.

10
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:47,275
Great.

11
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:47,735
Thank you.

12
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:56,945
So I know we're going to talk about girls on the run today, but before we get into that, I've been asking everybody about their favorite places to eat in Medford, what they like to eat there.

13
00:00:58,163 --> 00:01:02,905
So we have a favorite place for treats on Saturday or Sunday morning, Donuts with a Difference.

14
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:04,886
Oh my gosh, they're the best donuts.

15
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:07,367
Only thing is, there's always a queue.

16
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:11,208
You have to wait for them, so be prepared to wait, but they're well worth the wait.

17
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:17,991
And I'm not gonna say there's any such thing as an Irish donut, but these are very comparable to the donuts you get at home.

18
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,292
They're very light and fluffy and delish.

19
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:25,894
And because they're so busy and so popular, they're always warm when you get them, and they're gorgeous.

20
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:27,775
See that, Donuts with a Difference.

21
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:28,916
That's a good one.

22
00:01:29,016 --> 00:01:37,504
I know there's other places like Union Square Donuts that just do really fancy donuts, but the simpleness of the donuts with the difference in the freshness, that's what makes the difference.

23
00:01:37,524 --> 00:01:37,704
That's it.

24
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:40,126
Some of the fancy ones are too dense.

25
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:41,327
And don't get me wrong.

26
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:42,688
People love them, and that's great.

27
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:45,351
But I like a nice, light, fluffy one.

28
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:46,111
Same, same.

29
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:46,692
Good.

30
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:47,192
Well, thank you.

31
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:51,236
OK, so we wanted to hear a little bit about Girls on the Run.

32
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:53,037
So if you could just tell us a little bit about the program.

33
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,563
So Girls on the Run is an after school running program for girls through third through fifth grade.

34
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:03,367
But it's, I always tell people, it's far more than a running program.

35
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:08,312
So it was developed in, started in North Carolina in 1996.

36
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,694
This woman, Molly Barker is her name.

37
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:15,555
And her background is in education and social work.

38
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:19,796
And she's like a three-time Ironwoman, which is pretty cool.

39
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:20,096
Yeah.

40
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:30,300
So she kind of found the need in her community to start a program that was like specifically directed towards girls this age, right, 8 through 13.

41
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:37,082
And through her research, she kind of found that those years, girls are still kind of receptive to adult influences.

42
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:41,484
But they're also starting to feel like peer pressure and all that kind of stuff.

43
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:49,947
So she developed this program to be a bit positive influence and set some really good guidelines for them.

44
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:52,709
And she had 13 people in her first group.

45
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:58,371
And now in 2021, the program has served over 2 million girls around the country.

46
00:02:58,431 --> 00:02:59,291
Yeah, really cool.

47
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:03,193
And I think annually, the stats are like 200,000 girls a year enrolled.

48
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:08,356
in over 200 cities across the country.

49
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:08,816
Wow.

50
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:10,056
So it's pretty awesome.

51
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:12,378
Just had a 25th anniversary.

52
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:13,358
Yeah.

53
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:17,940
On the 25th anniversary, we had served two million girls.

54
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,421
Wow.

55
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:19,261
That was like the marker.

56
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:19,501
Yeah.

57
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:19,901
Wow.

58
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:20,522
Pretty cool.

59
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:20,922
That's awesome.

60
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:26,114
But when I say it's more than a running program, so it is a running program.

61
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:37,899
There's practice twice a week and we run at every practice and then the big event at the end is this big celebratory 5k that everyone, the goal is to complete it, right?

62
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,340
So there's lots of running, but it's far more than that.

63
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,581
There's a really kind of

64
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:46,082
There's a particular curriculum that we follow.

65
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,262
It's really intentional.

66
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:54,325
And it's all about social and emotional growth and positive behaviors, all of this kind of stuff.

67
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:55,125
It's really, really cool.

68
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:55,565
PETE LEPAGE, JR.:

69
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:56,566
: Awesome.

70
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,367
And so 5K, that's 3.1 miles, right?

71
00:03:59,387 --> 00:04:00,527
So that's a lot of running, yeah.

72
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:01,287
It's awesome.

73
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,568
PETE LEPAGE, JR.:

74
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:03,008
: Yeah.

75
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:06,309
And so is there an expectation of ability?

76
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09,190
Or do some people run the whole time or walk sometimes?

77
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,071
So Girls on the Run is available for everybody, right?

78
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,752
As long as you can move forward.

79
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:20,354
If you're running, walking, skipping, jumping, if you need a crutch or a wheelchair, there's a space for everybody.

80
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:30,617
And on that note, I will say, too, that because it's so important to make it available to everybody, there is the opportunity for financial assistance for families that qualify.

81
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:33,298
So it really is Girls on the Run we want.

82
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:37,300
Any girl that wants to participate, we want to make it available to them.

83
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,420
Yeah.

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,182
Oh, that's good history to hear about the program.

85
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:45,205
What kind of motivated you to get involved as a coach?

86
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:46,966
So I work in the fitness industry.

87
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:48,087
I have for a long time.

88
00:04:48,107 --> 00:04:52,710
In the last eight years, I've worked for HealthWorks.

89
00:04:52,770 --> 00:05:00,135
I'm going to give HealthWorks a shout out here now, because it's such a brilliant place to work, brilliant place to work out in, a great community to be a part of.

90
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:01,817
So side note.

91
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:07,800
If you're looking for a gym or a trainer or a space to take classes, look up Healthworks.

92
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,702
We are located in the Back Bay in Cambridge, in Coolidge Corner.

93
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,363
And it's an awesome place to visit, awesome place to be.

94
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:15,144
But it's women only.

95
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:16,445
It's a women only facility.

96
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:19,927
And so for the last eight years, I've

97
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:29,851
come across a lot of women that unfortunately have these unhealthy habits and unhealthy relationships with food and with exercise and body image issues.

98
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:33,392
And nine times out of 10, it all started when they were young.

99
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:45,417
And so when it was first introduced at the Roberts, so Brianna, who was Brianna Lunger-Curran, our current mayor and newly re-elected mayor.

100
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:48,618
When she was city councilwoman, she brought the program to the Roberts.

101
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,940
And I have two boys there.

102
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,522
And so it was a post on Facebook, like, if you have a young girl and you want to join this group.

103
00:05:56,622 --> 00:06:02,486
And I was like, man, I would love to get into that and help kind of like put my future self out of business.

104
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:02,806
Right.

105
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:07,789
So if you can start helping people when they're young, then when they're 30, they don't have to come to you.

106
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:11,230
And like, you know, that was kind of my think about it.

107
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,151
Also, I love running.

108
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:14,092
I love being outside and playing and messing.

109
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:16,954
Yeah, so I volunteered.

110
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:18,075
I messaged Brianna.

111
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,376
I was like, yeah, I'd love to be part of it.

112
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:20,297
And she was like, OK, cool.

113
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:21,819
And that was the very first season.

114
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,361
And here we are, five seasons later.

115
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:24,942
It's awesome.

116
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:25,242
Yeah.

117
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:27,344
And you mentioned having two boys.

118
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:34,430
So you probably have had conversations with them about the importance of you being involved in a program like this.

119
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:35,712
What are those conversations like?

120
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:41,114
Yeah, so I think, first of all, I think it's really important to give back to the community, right?

121
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:42,736
And so they know that.

122
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:47,740
Their dad coaches, he volunteers too, my husband, Ryan Murray.

123
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:50,663
So it's part of the family, that's what you do.

124
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,904
When you can, you help out.

125
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:54,606
You go, you pick up the rubbish when it's rubbish picking up day.

126
00:06:55,847 --> 00:07:02,829
buy a big good at the PTO sale, you make something, you just contribute however you can, whenever you can to your own community.

127
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,651
Because like in our minds, like you can contribute to the bigger picture.

128
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:12,393
But if you're not helping out at home and trying to be a part of the small changes that are right in front of you.

129
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:14,434
You know, that's not as good.

130
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:15,935
And so we do.

131
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:21,840
We talk about it a lot because there are like, unfortunately, these like unconscious biases still.

132
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,780
Right.

133
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:28,085
But part of Molly's program, when she started originally, she had this thing.

134
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:29,265
She called it the girl box.

135
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:36,652
And at that age, 8 to 13, is when we start to put ourselves or other people put us into the girl box, right?

136
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:38,774
Well, you can't do that because you're a girl.

137
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:41,296
Or you probably wouldn't want to do that because you're a girl.

138
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:44,279
Or I definitely can't do that because I'm a girl.

139
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,282
And so then you limit your capabilities.

140
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:53,847
You limit all of the possibilities for yourself as a young person or other people limit them for you.

141
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:58,651
And so the boys know that girls can do anything they can do.

142
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:04,135
But it also put, not just telling them, but I do it then, right?

143
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:09,580
I do all of the things that you would think that a boy could only do.

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,841
So lead by example, you know?

145
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:14,283
And then we have these conversations constantly.

146
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:18,306
And sometimes they don't even understand why a girl wouldn't be allowed to do something.

147
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:22,109
Like here in Boston, we have this history with the Boston Marathon.

148
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,094
And when Catherine had her anniversary, we were watching.

149
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:28,196
So the first woman to run the Boston Marathon.

150
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:30,659
And we were watching the celebrations.

151
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,741
And they're like, why?

152
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:32,341
We don't understand.

153
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,783
Like, what's the anniversary of?

154
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:36,166
Like, why was she not allowed to run previous to that?

155
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:39,110
And I was like, because girls weren't allowed.

156
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,331
And Connor legit was like.

157
00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:43,654
But Parker, in my class, is so much faster than me.

158
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,736
It doesn't make any sense that she's a girl and he's a boy.

159
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,278
She's just as fast, so she should be allowed to run if she wants to run.

160
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:51,561
So I think that we're really fortunate, Danielle.

161
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:55,605
Our generation is changing the way that we're raising our kids.

162
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:57,286
And so then our kids are going to be

163
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:03,571
Like, don't get me wrong, I'm sure there's still going to be struggles, and there'll be fights to be had, and challenges ahead.

164
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:11,798
But I think we're going to set them up for success in a way that some generations haven't beforehand, I would say.

165
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:13,820
Just build an awareness.

166
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:23,584
Well, I think it's one thing to tell girls what we want them to be capable of or how we value them, but that has to be sort of across the board.

167
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,564
That's it.

168
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:25,925
The boys have to know, too.

169
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:26,465
Yeah.

170
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:29,406
So when they see me, and like they do, Kian, not so much.

171
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:29,906
He's eight.

172
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:31,407
He doesn't care as much.

173
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:32,247
But Connor.

174
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:39,172
was in third grade when he had third grade friends as part of the program, and fourth grade, and now he's in fifth grade.

175
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,514
And so he'll ask me, what was the lesson today, Mom?

176
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:43,155
And I'm like, oh, it was about gratitude.

177
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,696
And here we go, and let's talk about it.

178
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,637
And he's like, yeah, that's awesome.

179
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:47,578
That makes sense.

180
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:48,619
It works for him, too.

181
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,119
You know what I mean?

182
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, it's good.

183
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,080
They love it.

184
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,082
And then they always come down to volunteer.

185
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,383
So yesterday, we had a practice 5K.

186
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:56,644
So Ryan and the kids came.

187
00:09:56,684 --> 00:10:01,587
They stood on one of the crosswalks to make sure that when the girls were running, there's no traffic or whatever.

188
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,007
So they're intuitive.

189
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:03,828
They're supportive.

190
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:04,308
It's awesome.

191
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:04,989
That's awesome.

192
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:05,649
Great.

193
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:05,889
Yeah.

194
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:10,532
And I'm wondering, has there been anything hard or a hard part about your role?

195
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:14,504
So I don't find coaching is fine.

196
00:10:14,524 --> 00:10:16,165
I have patience.

197
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:20,688
It's easy for me to be motivating and to keep it up and fun.

198
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:21,628
I love it.

199
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:22,569
I love coaching.

200
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:32,255
I will say that every season when we start again, being a mom of two boys and mostly hanging out with the boys, when you get together and there's like 25

201
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,352
young girls, the screaming.

202
00:10:36,872 --> 00:10:38,793
Like, there's so much screaming.

203
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,274
And I always forget.

204
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:42,815
And I always am like, oh my God, why is there so much screaming?

205
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:44,695
And then I remember, and it's fine.

206
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:49,837
But it's just a different thing when you have 25 girls, especially at the beginning of a season.

207
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:53,719
Because everyone's really excited, and there may be some new people that are nervous.

208
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,600
So the energy is just kind of bananas.

209
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:59,982
And it's very screamy.

210
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,804
But that's the only thing, honestly, I'd like.

211
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:04,906
Every day at home, I'd have this practice.

212
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:05,667
It was awesome.

213
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:07,309
Let me tell you who did what.

214
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:08,871
It's always a great experience.

215
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:09,712
It's great.

216
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:10,592
Yeah, it's great.

217
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:12,695
And what's been the most rewarding part for you?

218
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,660
Oh man, the rewarding parts.

219
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,661
There really is so many.

220
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:20,902
And in no particular order, right?

221
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:31,288
Firstly, on a personal level, it gives me the opportunity to connect with families that I may not cross paths with otherwise, right?

222
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,670
So if you're not in the boys' class or their grade or play on their sports team,

223
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,375
or if they don't play in the playground together or something, then there's a chance I may never meet you.

224
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:40,995
Do you know what I mean?

225
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:45,040
So it's cool for me personally, like I get to connect with other people in the community.

226
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,142
I think that's awesome.

227
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:51,987
And then rewarding, like every day, these girls work a little bit harder.

228
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:56,512
Whether it's running faster or not taking as many breaks

229
00:11:57,293 --> 00:12:22,021
or like just contributing more in a group discussion or like remembering a lesson from the week before like every day you see growth and then at the end of the day when we have our celebratory 5k which we can talk about in a minute but like when these girls cross the finish line there is no better feeling in the world like they legit each and every one of them feels like a superstar and it's just incredible yeah yeah

230
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:36,667
I think running is so interesting like compared to other sports where there's like a real discipline and it's like you're almost like competing against yourself even though you're in a race but like my dad also he's a coach cross-country track and field and he would always talk about like

231
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:55,154
his athletes being just really focused in lots of other ways and so there being these other benefits to to having running as a part of their life to think about a third grader running a 5k like i would have never like running for me as a kid was always like a punishment like you're late to practice you run laps or like you know yeah it was used as in that way and for to this

232
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,554
to really be like the way to empower these girls.

233
00:12:58,035 --> 00:12:59,675
It's a nice reframe.

234
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:00,555
Oh, it's awesome.

235
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:09,557
And like some of the girls this season are like third graders, like maybe just eight, you know, maybe they won't be nine until, like Mike Kean is eight, he won't be nine until next July.

236
00:13:09,597 --> 00:13:10,277
You know what I mean?

237
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:11,418
So they're only turning eight.

238
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:12,678
And they're killing it.

239
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:13,758
Yeah, it's great.

240
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:14,898
It's awesome.

241
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,179
And we make it, the coaches make it super fun too.

242
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:19,399
So it's not, it doesn't feel like punishment.

243
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,160
You know what I mean?

244
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,260
Yeah.

245
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,740
Yeah.

246
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,760
That's awesome.

247
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:26,293
How can girls get involved with girls on the run?

248
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:29,255
So let me tell you, there's so many ways.

249
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,995
So we have two teams here in Medford, which is awesome.

250
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:38,717
There's also another part of, under the umbrella of Girls on the Run, there's another part called Heart and Soul for older girls.

251
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:42,138
You can go onto girlsontherun.org and have a look.

252
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:47,900
I don't know enough about that program, because I don't, I just, sorry, I just hit the microphone.

253
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,821
I don't coach that, so I won't speak on that one, but it is there if you have older girls that are interested.

254
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,902
But there's a million ways to get involved, right?

255
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:59,084
So girlsontherun.org, you can volunteer to be a coach.

256
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:02,786
You don't have to have kids in the program, like I don't.

257
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:04,386
You don't have to live in the town.

258
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:09,349
We have a lovely coach, Leah, who's been with us for ages, and she doesn't live in Medford, but she's awesome.

259
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,712
And if you don't have a site close to you, you could apply for a site.

260
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:19,313
all on girlsontherun.org if you want to bring it to your community.

261
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:25,596
You can, for the big celebratory 5k, you can volunteer on that day.

262
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:27,396
We're always looking for volunteers for that.

263
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:35,819
There's, if you know a girl that's running or participating in the program, we ask for a running buddy for the 5k day.

264
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:38,520
So all the girls have to run with a buddy who's over 18.

265
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:46,304
You can go on to girlsontherun.org again and buy some schwag.

266
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:51,147
So there's jumpers and hats and mugs and things.

267
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:53,148
You can buy great Christmas presents, right?

268
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:56,150
You can also sponsor a Girl on the Run.

269
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:01,913
So like if you want, like one year a client of mine sponsored a Girl on the Run for me as a Christmas gift.

270
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,173
Oh, so special.

271
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:03,834
I was crying.

272
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:23,792
like that's really cool right to be able to put that like I said there is a sliding scale if a family needs financial aid it's available but also like for somebody else to gift that to you like that's super cool and then just spread the word you know like it's all over the country so if you have an aunt in Philadelphia or like a cousin in

273
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,688
I don't know, Texas.

274
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:30,269
And they have small, little, young girls, should I say, in their lives.

275
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:31,570
Just spread the word.

276
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:39,853
The more people that know about it, the more girls that take advantage and participate in the program, the better we'll all be.

277
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:41,233
Awesome.

278
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,237
And so for girls that want to run, for girls on the run, is it the fall season?

279
00:15:45,298 --> 00:15:45,978
Is it all year?

280
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:51,504
Yeah, so the fall season is coming to an end on November 20th when we have our celebratory 5K.

281
00:15:51,704 --> 00:15:53,746
I said that a few times.

282
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:59,492
And then the spring season, I don't have dates for it yet, but there is a spring season and a fall season.

283
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:08,140
And that will be we'll be getting that information soon enough because they do they get the coaches in early We go through training when you're a turning coach.

284
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:17,088
You don't have to do as much training But and every season this training to be done get CPR certified And we are mandated reporters too.

285
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:22,833
So there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes to beforehand and And so that will be out soon enough

286
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:26,437
But all of it's on girlsontherun.org.

287
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:30,902
And you can follow them on Instagram, on Facebook, like all of the social media platforms.

288
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:31,442
Awesome.

289
00:16:31,702 --> 00:16:33,825
And so the 5K is November 20th?

290
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:34,906
Yeah, let's talk about it.

291
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:36,007
So, November 20th.

292
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:42,074
We're really lucky because the 5K is being hosted in Medford at Hormel Stadium.

293
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:50,837
So and it has a couple of years previous, it's been there and then we didn't do it in person with a big group during COVID, unfortunately.

294
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,898
So this is like a big deal to have it back in person.

295
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:56,879
And it's all of the teams from the greater Boston area.

296
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:58,220
So there's going to be over 800 girls.

297
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,403
running with their running buddy, so 1,600 people at least.

298
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:07,847
Then there's coaches, there's grandparents, it's going to be so fun.

299
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:16,355
And the girls get there in the morning, we all have a team t-shirt, right, which is great, and every girl is number one, which is really cool, yeah.

300
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:21,336
And so you get there, and there's a DJ, there's music, there's balloons.

301
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:22,596
It's so festive.

302
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:30,718
And just to point out to you, I know you said earlier when you were talking about being focused and running in a race, you're running against yourself.

303
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:34,899
This is, just to be clear, it's non-competitive.

304
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,760
It's not about who's the fastest.

305
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:44,542
It's about completing your goal of how long you want it to take you to get there and crossing the finish line, doing the whole thing.

306
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:51,886
And we do also have one woman who always crosses last and she's in a Wonder Woman costume.

307
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:54,107
Therefore, no girl is ever last.

308
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:54,587
Right.

309
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:55,948
No, there's no like last place.

310
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:59,310
Wonder Woman always finishes last, which is an awesome way to close it out.

311
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:08,855
But the girls, there's loads of like flair and glitter hairspray and glitter face paints and

312
00:18:10,262 --> 00:18:11,504
A lot more screaming.

313
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:13,165
It was so fun.

314
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,347
Everyone's so excited.

315
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:20,133
And when they go out, like when the girls cross over, like I said, every single one of them comes back in.

316
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:22,015
We have 27 girls on our team this year.

317
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,199
Every one of them feeling like an absolute superstar.

318
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,101
Like, how rewarding is that?

319
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,523
Like, the best feeling in the world.

320
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:30,585
And then when you think about it, like,

321
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:39,992
It's just such like for them, it's such a tangible understanding of like setting a goal, working hard towards it and completing a goal, right?

322
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:41,833
Life skills like that's forever.

323
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:42,514
Do you know what I mean?

324
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:43,454
It's awesome.

325
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:45,135
And just their sense of accomplishment.

326
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:53,361
And they're all so proud of themselves and they're so proud of each other, you know, and they all like as soon as one crosses, they'll turn around and get ready to clap for the next one.

327
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:54,502
And that's brilliant.

328
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:55,863
It's a brilliant day out.

329
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:59,784
If you're here on November 20th, come to Hormel Stadium.

330
00:19:00,364 --> 00:19:04,785
You can cheer along the route, you can cheer at the stadium, you can get a feel for what it's all about.

331
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:08,706
And like I said, we're always looking for volunteers for that day too.

332
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:10,226
GirlsOnTheRun.org.

333
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:12,967
Right, and I'll put that in our show notes too.

334
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:13,767
Oh yeah, yeah.

335
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,267
Because I haven't said it enough.

336
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:18,388
It's easy for me to remember now too.

337
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:22,279
So is there anything else that you wanted to add about Girls On The Run?

338
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,666
So if I could go back to talking about the curriculum just for a minute to give folks a better idea of what it's all about.

339
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:34,170
So we have, each practice has a lesson attached to it, right?

340
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:37,734
And they fall under this umbrella of what we call the five C's.

341
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:40,456
So competence, confidence,

342
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:43,959
connection, character, and caring.

343
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:53,205
And so, like, the first few lessons are all about understanding, like, helping the girls understand their own core values and, like, what's important to them.

344
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:57,649
And then the middle few are about, like, teamwork and connection.

345
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:03,473
And then the last few are about, like, community and how you can have a positive impact in your own community.

346
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,134
And the lessons are awesome.

347
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:17,182
They go from lessons on gratitude, on managing your emotions and being able to express your emotions, resolving conflict and resiliency.

348
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,823
The lessons are awesome.

349
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:29,651
And they all line up to have this very positive influence on behaviors, habits, and life skills moving forward.

350
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:30,831
You know what I mean?

351
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:32,052
That sounds great.

352
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:32,853
It's awesome.

353
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:36,531
I would like to say, give the coaches a shout out.

354
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:42,236
Because we have this stellar group of coaches here in Redford at the Roberts.

355
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:44,998
Each, very different backgrounds.

356
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,781
Everybody has their own coaching style.

357
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:50,063
Everybody interacts with the girls a little bit differently.

358
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:52,465
But we make it work.

359
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:53,966
And they keep it super fun.

360
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,387
Everyone is super dedicated.

361
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,449
They're a great crew.

362
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,453
And I think that Redford Roberts is really lucky to have our coaches.

363
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:02,413
Yeah.

364
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:02,773
Yeah.

365
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:03,333
Awesome.

366
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:03,773
Yeah.

367
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:04,173
Thank you.

368
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:07,714
Well, thank you so much for talking about Girls on the Run, letting us know.

369
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:09,514
I learned a lot from this interview.

370
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:11,495
And thank you for the work that you're doing.

371
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,815
Thanks for having me, Danielle.

372
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:14,335
You're killing it, the podcast.

373
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:14,775
Thank you.

374
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:15,315
Killing it.

375
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:15,815
All right.

376
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:16,115
Thanks.

Now, let's hear from some of the Girls on the Run participants.

383
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:54,681
What is your name?

384
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:56,562
My name is Kay Benowitz.

385
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,323
What are your pronouns?

386
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:00,604
She, her, and hers.

387
00:22:01,722 --> 00:22:02,542
And how old are you?

388
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:04,363
I'm eight years old.

389
00:22:05,863 --> 00:22:09,223
And what is your best memory about Girls on the Run so far?

390
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:15,344
When I wrote my goal, 12 laps.

391
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:19,585
And on Tuesday, I got 12.

392
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:23,106
And then I practiced a little more.

393
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,567
And on Thursday, I really showed off.

394
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:28,087
And I got 15.

395
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:29,827
I was really excited.

396
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,863
That's my best goal.

397
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:39,165
And then what advice might you give to a new girl coming on to Girls in the Room?

398
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:46,827
I would say to keep your pace and to keep going, running, jogging, or walking.

399
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:49,367
And you should always have fun.

400
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:50,668
Awesome.

401
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:51,788
Thank you.

402
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:57,549
Hi, my name is Audrey.

403
00:22:58,089 --> 00:22:58,549
She, her.

404
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,610
I'm in third grade and nine years old.

405
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:10,722
This is my first season of Girls on the Run and my best memories so far are getting my first energy award at practice and when I finished my practice 5k.

406
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:13,803
I was really proud of myself after both.

407
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:20,927
The energy award is given to a couple girls at the end of practice for working super hard and not giving up.

408
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:25,609
The best advice I have for other girls is to keep on going and

409
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:30,168
moving forward, even if you have to walk or slow down.

410
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:34,009
Just keep going forward and always encourage each other.

411
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,010
Hi, my name is Parker Sheeher.

412
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,491
I'm 11 years old and I'm in fifth grade.

413
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:46,473
I've had so many fun memories from Girls on the Run, and it's super hard to just choose one.

414
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,314
But I do love the end of the season pizza party in 5K.

415
00:23:51,254 --> 00:23:55,115
We paint our faces, cheer on our teammates, and have a lot of fun with the running.

416
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:57,871
Running is one of my favorite things to do.

417
00:23:58,632 --> 00:24:05,873
The best advice I would give to other girls is to try your hardest, persevere, but also have a lot of fun along the way.

418
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:12,975
I'll be sad to leave the Girls on the Run program when I'm in sixth grade, but I'm super excited to run cross country.

419
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:18,196
Good luck to all my teenagers in the upcoming 5K, and thank you so much for having me on this podcast.

420
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:28,460
Thanks so much to Coach Aoife and to Parker, Audrey, and Kay, as well as to their parents.

421
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:30,903
Thanks to everyone for listening.

00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:36,590

423
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:43,118

00:24:43,258 --> 00:24:44,079

425
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:45,981
Medford Bites.

426
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:46,382
Good job.
