[SPEAKER_03]: The way to approach life.

28
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:57,866
[SPEAKER_02]: That allows you to think outside of yourself and see how you're affecting the world around you.

29
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:01,289

47
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:29,799
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, my friend Terry here, he has had a tough life, but you know what?

48
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:36,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's all about understanding what's on the inside, because isn't that what life's all about?

49
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:41,799
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we think here at the Andrews, and that's why Terry and I always like to show the Mustang way.
