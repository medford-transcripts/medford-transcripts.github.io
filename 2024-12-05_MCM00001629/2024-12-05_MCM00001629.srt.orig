00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:05,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so welcome to the Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund, Wednesday, November 6th, 2024.

2
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:10,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to call the meeting to order.

3
00:00:10,373 --> 00:00:13,294

00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Roberta Cameron.

00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:18,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Carrie Weaver.

00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:21,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Penelope Taylor.

7
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:21,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.

8
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:22,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Lisa Sun.

9
00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:23,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.

10
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:27,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Brianna Longo.

11
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:28,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

12
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,271
[SPEAKER_07]: and Lisa Ann Davidson here.

13
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:43,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight we have, in the last meeting we discussed inviting individuals to talk about various housing resources available in the city.

14
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:58,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Today we'd like to invite the city's community block grant, yeah, community development block grant manager, CDBG, Laurel Siegel to talk to us about CDBG and the housing services that are supported by CDBG.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for coming.

16
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:01,541
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

17
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:02,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to be here.

18
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:07,543
[SPEAKER_03]: So Aditi said that you had some questions for me.

19
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:11,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I can give you a little bit of a basic background about the funding.

20
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:13,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure exactly what you wanted to know.

21
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:23,808
[SPEAKER_03]: So Medford is an entitlement community, which means that we receive direct funding for CBPG from HUD every year.

22
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:28,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Our current funding is a little bit under $1.4 million.

23
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:30,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $1.384 million this year.

24
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:39,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Of that amount, we allocate the maximum permissible 20% to administration.

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,965
[SPEAKER_03]: That includes paying salaries such as myself and DT, as well as

26
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,759
[SPEAKER_03]: paying for certain studies.

27
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, some of that funding is going towards some of the zoning technical amendments and other studies in the city.

28
00:01:55,862 --> 00:02:01,044
[SPEAKER_03]: We also allocate the maximum 15% to public services.

29
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:12,369
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes to a variety of outside agencies that we provide grants to, everything from transportation services to services for our elder residents,

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,223
[SPEAKER_03]: We do currently fund two housing-related programs.

31
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:20,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Through Housing Families, we provide legal services.

32
00:02:21,928 --> 00:02:26,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And through ABCD, we provide rent and utility assistance.

33
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:30,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And then balance of the funds is divided up amongst a variety of programs.

34
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:36,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that is going towards the new rehab home loan program that we've just kicked off.

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that will go to some economic development programs,

36
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:45,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And a substantial portion of it goes towards infrastructure projects, parking improvements, roadway improvements, everything.

37
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:49,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's sort of the overarching.

38
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:54,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you do you mind if I ask a few questions?

39
00:02:55,132 --> 00:03:00,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm familiar with CDBG, and it's really exciting to hear that Medford's doing a rehab program.

40
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:04,279
[SPEAKER_07]: What is Medford doing with their rehab programs?

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to actually address that, Aditi, since you're managing that?

42
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:11,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Laurel, and I'm managing it.

43
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:22,613
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a funding of $100,000, and we are planning to provide housing rehab services to up to four homeowners each

44
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:25,547
[SPEAKER_01]: $35,000 per unit.

45
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:34,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently we have hired community opportunities group which is administering this program.

46
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:51,033
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, we went through the whole initial stage of applications.

47
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:54,034
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran the lottery about two weeks ago.

48
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:59,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're working with our initial applicants that were selected for the lotteries.

49
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:03,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask how many people applied?

50
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:03,678
10.

51
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:04,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

52
00:04:04,698 --> 00:04:04,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

53
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And for just a couple of exams of what the roofs and

54
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:16,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Heating system repairs, air conditioning system repairs, foundation repair, and window replacement.

55
00:04:18,462 --> 00:04:22,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those were the most raised concerns.

56
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:26,126
[SPEAKER_06]: And do we... I'm sorry, Penny, did you want to say something?

57
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:29,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering just how the word got out about the program and how it promoted.

58
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:46,846
[SPEAKER_01]: We had it in our newsletters and then through mayor's office there was a news release as well and we did outreach at the senior center and then public library.

59
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:47,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

60
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,985
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got a couple more follow-up questions.

61
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:58,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So with the heating system AC and window replacements, are you working with MassSave to try to get the best bang for your buck?

62
00:04:58,767 --> 00:04:59,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's the plan.

63
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:07,789
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have already spoken to Community Opportunities Group to review MassSave's program and include that as part of the services.

64
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:09,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you saved four homeowners at $25,000 a year.

65
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it homeowners or actual?

66
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:22,540
[SPEAKER_07]: are you only helping the eligible homeowner or what if there's a tenant involved, it's a two family?

67
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,883
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a two family, the homeowner should be residing in one of the units.

68
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:32,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me rephrase the question.

69
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:45,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's a two family and you'd have 50% of the property eligible, would CDBG funds be used to assist both units, the tenant and the homeowner?

70
00:05:45,505 --> 00:05:46,606
[SPEAKER_07]: are not occupied?

71
00:05:51,352 --> 00:06:03,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have I think one application where it's a two-family unit and community opportunities group is reviewing tenants income eligibility at this point and they said that if they

72
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:13,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I think overall, they should, if they're not eligible, but if the homeowners are still eligible, they would still provide services for the whole property.

73
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:16,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So, technically, they could get up to $50,000.

74
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:16,532
[SPEAKER_07]: No, $25,000.

75
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:21,774
[SPEAKER_07]: $25,000 per property and not per unit.

76
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:24,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, all right, thank you.

77
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:29,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the pilot program, it is a requirement that at least one of the units be owner-occupied.

78
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:33,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so it does have to be a rehab program.

79
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:35,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

80
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:36,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

81
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:42,264
[SPEAKER_07]: You said it's a pilot program.

82
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,631
[SPEAKER_07]: And I assume eligibility cap is 80% of AMI?

83
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:50,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

84
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:13,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And then about your housing, your rent and utility assistance through ABCD, how much do they usually, well, it's 15% of your grant, right?

85
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:15,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Approximately.

86
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:17,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, their current grant is about $3,000.

87
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:27,986
[SPEAKER_03]: They do pair up our funding with RAFT and other sources of funding because the limits on the amount of funding that we're able to provide.

88
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:29,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And how much do you...

89
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:32,172
[SPEAKER_03]: to provide for an eligible household?

90
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:37,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that currently they're providing about $1,200 per eligible household.

91
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:45,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Of CDBG.

92
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:50,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Of CDBG, and that's also in addition to, I think that they also get CPA money.

93
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,448
[SPEAKER_07]: ABCD gets CPA to also help them.

94
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:53,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

95
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, and others.

96
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:01,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Exciting.

97
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:02,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

98
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:11,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else have any questions on CBPG?

99
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:24,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'm curious, do you get info on how many people are accessing legal services?

100
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:25,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

101
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:43,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're required to provide quarterly reporting to me on exactly certain metrics that we need to collect on race, ethnicity, and income level, but also just confirming whether or not we're meeting the benchmarks of their contract for the year.

102
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:43,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

103
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:49,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Curious if we know how many people access legal services in the last year?

104
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:58,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Off the top of my head, you know, it's not huge numbers, but I want to say for housing families,

105
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't want to speak.

106
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:11,393
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a number of different grantees, so I don't want to inadvertently inflate their numbers with somebody else's.

107
00:09:11,513 --> 00:09:12,733
[SPEAKER_03]: People are using it.

108
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:13,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.

109
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:14,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

110
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:16,754
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making good use of the funding.

111
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:27,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you know if those get referred just in early stages of eviction or usually later stage or kind of whenever someone comes with the... Yeah, I think it's a wide variety.

112
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:27,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

113
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:28,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much.

114
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:29,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

115
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:32,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And self-certification, or do you do the income documentation?

116
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:36,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it varies from subrecipient to subrecipient.

117
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:53,494
[SPEAKER_03]: We do provide the self-certification form, but certainly some of the agencies like public families, they tend to go a little bit deeper because, and certainly ABCD, where they're providing the direct financial support, they'll go a little bit deeper into verifying the income status of the applicants.

118
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:55,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

119
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:55,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

120
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:57,056
[SPEAKER_05]: One question to the chair.

121
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:03,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we're bringing it to you from some of those, I don't know, that would actually be CPA.

122
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:05,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So CDBG.

123
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:16,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how could we as a affordable housing trust collaborate and with CDBG to pursue our endeavors?

124
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:21,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, I guess, you know, is there anything in the planning or does someone will do anything?

125
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, does anybody have any thoughts on that or is that just something where

126
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:31,930
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a great question because it's similar to what I was thinking of.

127
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:46,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I look at performers that are coming in from developers who are seeking money through the Somerville Affordable Housing Trust Fund and the Somerville Home Money as well.

128
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:57,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes the city of Somerville is able to put in CDBG money for acquisition funds, and then we couple it.

129
00:10:57,938 --> 00:10:58,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, let me rephrase that.

130
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:03,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Somerville couples it with other funding sources.

131
00:11:04,555 --> 00:11:06,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, absolutely, it would be an eligible use.

132
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:18,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is a matter of what our plans are, how much our funding continues in the future, and what our other demands are for these funds.

133
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:30,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of us right now are looking at taking out a Section 108 loan in order to help fund a project over at the North Street.

134
00:11:32,319 --> 00:12:00,938
[SPEAKER_03]: housing thank you the housing development and that is a possibility here as well through the chair i i'm curious you mentioned kind of eligible projects so if there are any kind of top lines with eligibility parameters just in as we're brainstorming or if we can figure out how it all fits together yeah i mean it's certainly and you know affordable housing is is definitely an eligible item for cdg that's you know it's clearly within

135
00:12:01,558 --> 00:12:03,579
[SPEAKER_03]: the wheelhouse of what is eligible there.

136
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, through to you.

137
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:30,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And then through the chair, the, so I apologize, I didn't hear the beginning of your presentation, so I don't know if you already covered this, but I'm curious to know, what is the amount of funding that there's potentially discretion, so I know that a percentage is used for,

138
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:40,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So certain things and then a percentage you have some discretion over and is that amount that you have discretion over already really.

139
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:45,622
[SPEAKER_02]: programmed through your action plan?

140
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:51,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did discuss that a bit up front, but I'm happy to go back over that.

141
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:59,275
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to the action plan for the current year, yes, it's all fully programmed.

142
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:03,039
[SPEAKER_03]: We receive a little bit less than $1.4 million

143
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:15,024
[SPEAKER_03]: After we allocate towards administrative costs and public services, the remaining funding is just shy of $900,000 that we're allocating among the various projects.

144
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:21,386
[SPEAKER_03]: We are actually in the midst of developing our next consolidated plan for the next five-year period.

145
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:33,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're working through the consortium because we're part of the North Suburban Consortium that is done through that as opposed to individually as Medford,

146
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:40,669
[SPEAKER_03]: community and that will establish what our overarching goals are for CDBG over the next five year period.

147
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:44,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will help inform how we use the money going forward.

148
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:46,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

149
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:46,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.

150
00:13:48,095 --> 00:14:03,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And would it be appropriate at this time to also think about or look at how much home funding is potentially available and what is the way that, what is Medford's relationship to home funding?

151
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:20,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm going to talk about that in the next agenda, but happy to say there's approximately $1.7 million allocated for affordable housing development, but this is divided among the eight different communities.

152
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:29,141
[SPEAKER_01]: And $100,000 is allotted for one assistant unit, home assistant unit.

153
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, you said $100,000 for one?

154
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:31,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

155
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:40,776
[SPEAKER_05]: and a consolidated plan would address both CDBG and HOME.

156
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:53,060
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is your fiscal year 24 at 1.24?

157
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,062
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fiscal year 24, yes.

158
00:14:57,782 --> 00:15:01,323
[SPEAKER_01]: But though I think currently we are in program year 23.

159
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they are working that out.

160
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,665
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little confusing.

161
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:10,727
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's how, I think they are one year delayed by the actual program year.

162
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:17,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, where is slowly into the home money?

163
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:24,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I guess I'm curious about the process of considering programs.

164
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:28,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're like, program out for this year, but like, do are you approach?

165
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:29,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you seek them out?

166
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:31,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of how that what that process looks like.

167
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:37,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, and bear in mind, I've only been doing this for about a year and a half with the city.

168
00:15:37,574 --> 00:15:40,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've only really been through one full cycle.

169
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:50,176
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think it's a mix of awareness of projects that need funding, just through conversations, you know, throughout the building.

170
00:15:50,856 --> 00:16:00,178
[SPEAKER_03]: But also as we start approaching developing the annual action plan for the year, we reach out to different departments around the city to talk about, so, you know, sort of

171
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:07,036
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the awareness, and then we sit down, we have a team that sits down and says, okay, this is the funding that we expect to have.

172
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:08,496
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the demands.

173
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:11,057
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we want to prioritize for the year?

174
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:14,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly the mayor is part of that conversation.

175
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:16,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's good to have Laurel here.

176
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:23,419
[SPEAKER_05]: She knows the group is active, and if we have ideas, yeah, we'll hopefully be on our radar after myself, her DP, and the committee.

177
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder, then,

178
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:49,970
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a way, so thinking about how Summerville uses CDBG to supplement funding from other sources for affordable housing, but often those opportunities probably come up on a shorter timeline than being able to anticipate them a year in advance for the action plan.

179
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe that's not true.

180
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:07,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there's a process for allocating maybe an event and like how what what funding might be available to consider for that purpose.

181
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's through your action plan.

182
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:14,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you have to be able to say, this is what we're going to do.

183
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:19,229
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to put in acquisition money with our CDBG.

184
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

185
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:25,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Which sounds like this is where you're just starting that process right now.

186
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:38,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, because we're anticipating having the drafting of the consolidated plan finished by late February, which then will move into the action plan, because all of that has to be approved by May 15th.

187
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, by the city and then submitted to HUD for their review and approval.

188
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:43,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, absolutely.

189
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:52,893
[SPEAKER_03]: If we anticipated wanting to spend any funding from CDBG on the trust for next year, we'd have to put that into the action plan for next year.

190
00:17:55,666 --> 00:18:00,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I saw an email to me that they're looking for input.

191
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:04,309
[SPEAKER_07]: So did you send out emails to everybody in the trustees?

192
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:09,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you resend the email just in case?

193
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

194
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:12,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

195
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:20,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what you're using to start trying to put together your action plan is what is the survey and what is the community saying?

196
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:28,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, to set the overarching goals for the five years, and then from there we'll develop the individual action plans for the coming year.

197
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:33,534
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like today was the last day to take that survey, so I don't know if there was an extension.

198
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:38,156
[SPEAKER_06]: They had just extended it to November 29th, so we have a little bit more time.

199
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're thinking about it.

200
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:41,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

201
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:45,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It's lengthy, but not, you know, it shouldn't take more than 10, 15 minutes.

202
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:53,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we know what it's actually going to be used for, for people who were not sure what a CDBG was.

203
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:54,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

204
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:58,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody else have any other questions about CDBG?

205
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:05,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for coming on.

206
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

207
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It was helpful.

208
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:12,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, on to home.

209
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:19,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So Aditi will talk about the North Shore Suburban Consortium NSC home program.

210
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,323
[SPEAKER_01]: So Medford is part of Home Investment Partnership Program, which is administered by HUD.

211
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:31,906
[SPEAKER_01]: The program provides funding to build, buy, or rehabilitate affordable housing units.

212
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:40,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is part of the North Suburban Consortium, which is a group of eight communities that collectively apply for home funds.

213
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:51,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford, Arlington, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Melrose, Revere, and Wintrow are the eight communities that form the consortium.

214
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:57,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So each community has an NSC representative that serves on the board of the NSC.

215
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:03,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Daniel has been serving for a long time and recently have taken over the position.

216
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:06,655
[SPEAKER_01]: So home funds are allocated.

217
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:10,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure most of you know about this list.

218
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:15,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Home funds are allocated to participating jurisdictions.

219
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:31,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Participating jurisdictions could be local governments or state governments who are eligible to receive funds of at least $500,000 based on a certain formula calculated by HUD.

220
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:41,739
[SPEAKER_01]: So in case communities that are not eligible to receive that dollar amount, they can form a consortium, which is why NSE comes into picture.

221
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:52,862
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to receiving the minimum funding of $500,000, the participating jurisdiction has to provide a local amount of $750,000 to its home program.

222
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:01,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So under NSE, there are probably three main home-funded activities.

223
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:04,608
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is affordable housing development.

224
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:09,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So home provides funding to develop home ownership projects as well as rental projects.

225
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:16,678
[SPEAKER_01]: For home ownership, households have to earn income at or below 80% AMI.

226
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:25,525
[SPEAKER_01]: For rental projects, at least 90% of the tenants have to earn income at or below 60% AMI.

227
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:32,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And per unit subsidy that NSC provides is $100,000.

228
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:32,529
[SPEAKER_01]: And then...

229
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:45,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's also a purchase limit that is set by HUD for Medford, specifically a one-bedroom unit.

230
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,111
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for home ownership.

231
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:48,972
[SPEAKER_01]: One-bedroom unit is $606,000.

232
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:49,672
[SPEAKER_01]: A two-bedroom unit is $775,000.

233
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:50,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And a three-bedroom unit is $939,000.

234
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:52,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And a four-bedroom unit is 1.1 million.

235
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:53,294
[SPEAKER_01]: So often when a home,

236
00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:11,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Ownership development is rehabilitated.

237
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:19,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Developers have to ensure that it doesn't exceed the homeownership value that HUD has assigned.

238
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:30,437
[SPEAKER_01]: As mentioned earlier, there's about $1.75 million specifically for homeownership and rental projects for the program year 24.

239
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:39,349
[SPEAKER_01]: The second part of the NSE funding program is our down payment assistance.

240
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:42,672
[SPEAKER_01]: We briefly talked about this during the CPA application.

241
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:50,660
[SPEAKER_01]: So NSE offers up to $100,000 down payment assistance for non-subsidized properties and $5,000 for NSE subsidized property.

242
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:03,540
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a deferred loan, a five-year deferred loan with 0% interest.

243
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And each anniversary date, 20% of the original down payment assistance is forgiven.

244
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:12,547
[SPEAKER_01]: And in five years, the loan is completely forgiven.

245
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:18,472
[SPEAKER_01]: $80,000 is allocated for down payment assistance program.

246
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:24,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third part of the NSC Home Fund activity is the CHODO operating assistance.

247
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:30,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the North Suburban Consortium has three different CHODOs.

248
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:33,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford has its own CHODO, which is the Medford Community Housing.

249
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:45,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So CHODOs are private, nonprofit, community-based service organizations that develop affordable housing in a particular community or it can be

250
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,984
[SPEAKER_01]: City-specific or regional, like the neighborhood developers is a regional CHODO, whereas Medford Community Housing is specific to our community.

251
00:23:55,605 --> 00:24:03,349
[SPEAKER_01]: They receive $25,000 per year as operating funds.

252
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:14,094
[SPEAKER_01]: That can involve salaries, employee compensation, insurance, utilities, rent, and so on, basically for the functioning of the organization.

253
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford Community Housing is currently building three new units.

254
00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:21,596
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Pell's Way project.

255
00:24:22,637 --> 00:24:37,630
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition to receiving CHODO operating assistance, NSC has allocated 15% of this home punch, which is around $300,000, set aside specifically for CHODOs to develop affordable housing.

256
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:46,089
[SPEAKER_01]: So broadly, there are three different programs, equitable housing development, down payment assistance program, and then H.O.A.D.

257
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:46,789
[SPEAKER_01]: manuals.

258
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:56,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Laurel mentioned, even NSE is doing a five-year consolidated plan.

259
00:24:57,337 --> 00:25:00,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hoping to finalize by end of February.

260
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:04,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

261
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:21,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So the CHOTO, it's actually required by home funding to put 15% to CHOTO, CHOTO operating, and then you have an option to do CHOTO operating dollars, which is what you're doing with the 25,000 per.

262
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:22,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's not often.

263
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:25,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I think every year they do get $25,000 as operating.

264
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:25,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

265
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:44,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Like home requires you to do CHODO products, projects, developments, but they don't require you to use CHODO, to give them CHODO operative.

266
00:25:45,614 --> 00:25:45,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

267
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:46,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

268
00:25:51,477 --> 00:25:54,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And you said there's $100,000 for DPA, up to $100,000 for down payment assistance.

269
00:25:54,578 --> 00:25:54,558
$10,000.

270
00:25:54,598 --> 00:25:55,018
[SPEAKER_07]: $10,000.

271
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:55,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

272
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:09,694
[SPEAKER_01]: for a unit that has not received home funds, but for a unit that has received home funds, it's $5,000.

273
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:10,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, $10,000.

274
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:15,215
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes more sense, because you said it was $80,000.

275
00:26:16,315 --> 00:26:20,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to clarify regarding your previous question about Chodo.

276
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:24,157
[SPEAKER_01]: From my understanding, I think each community may not have a Chodo.

277
00:26:24,197 --> 00:26:30,138
[SPEAKER_01]: HUD does not require each community to have a Chodo, but if you do have a Chodo, then the Chodo

278
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:42,761
[SPEAKER_01]: must receive $25,000 operating assistance.

279
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:51,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

280
00:26:51,248 --> 00:26:52,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is one question.

281
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:59,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we getting close to the point where we would have enough to have our own home fund in Medford?

282
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:03,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not too sure yet.

283
00:27:04,353 --> 00:27:10,974
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can ask Maldon or Daniel specifically.

284
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

285
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:14,534
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the goal.

286
00:27:14,795 --> 00:27:16,455
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting there eventually, right?

287
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:17,435
[SPEAKER_04]: With population.

288
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:17,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

289
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:21,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

290
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:27,637
[SPEAKER_02]: The question to the chair is, is it competitive

291
00:27:28,746 --> 00:27:35,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Among the communities, how is the money distributed between the eight-member communities?

292
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:45,539
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get competitive sometimes, but the money is on a rolling basis, so whoever comes first can apply.

293
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,681
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as there's funds,

294
00:27:49,562 --> 00:27:52,084
[SPEAKER_01]: they keep spending the funds, yes.

295
00:27:52,824 --> 00:28:05,173
[SPEAKER_01]: But also Walking Court, which is a project by Medford Housing Authority, recently it has saved, I think, nearly 1.8 million.

296
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:05,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

297
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:14,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do try to spread it amongst the communities if we hadn't received anything out of the Felser project over the years.

298
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:21,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And NSE has told ARPA funds, which is why they were able to bring in more money.

299
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:28,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, 1.8, that must have been multiple fiscal years.

300
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:30,107
[SPEAKER_01]: And ARPA.

301
00:28:30,307 --> 00:28:32,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Or program years.

302
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:38,471
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say program years, because HUD does their years don't start until October and everybody else.

303
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:52,864
[SPEAKER_07]: So the 1.8 for the Bellsway was probably, I'm sorry, was that a combination of home funds and home ARP?

304
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:53,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

305
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:54,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

306
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you want to do a quick

307
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:10,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick summary of HomeARP for people that don't know what HomeARP, am I putting you on the spot?

308
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:12,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not familiar with HomeARP.

309
00:29:12,957 --> 00:29:13,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

310
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:15,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it ARPA?

311
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's ARPA.

312
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,600
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not ARPA, it's ARP.

313
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:26,804
[SPEAKER_07]: It's A-R-P, Home American Rescue Plan or something like that.

314
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:29,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget what it is.

315
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:31,127
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's very different from HomeBalloon.

316
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:41,002
[SPEAKER_07]: It is home money is used like we were saying home money is used for development and there's really a requirement.

317
00:29:41,723 --> 00:29:50,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is something that I want to double check because my understanding is that you have to put 15%, whether you have a child or not.

318
00:29:51,850 --> 00:30:03,755
[SPEAKER_07]: At this moment in time, you have to designate 15% to a Chodo and there's a lot of PJs out there that actually lose that money because there are no Chodos.

319
00:30:04,295 --> 00:30:05,976
[SPEAKER_07]: But the whole ARP money,

320
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,665
[SPEAKER_07]: is really, they have different requirements.

321
00:30:10,146 --> 00:30:15,928
[SPEAKER_07]: You can use it for development, but you can also use it for services.

322
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:32,696
[SPEAKER_07]: You can use it to pay for rental assistance and payments, short-term rental subsidies, et cetera, et cetera, only if you put it in your plan, and the plan is due December 22, 23, I think.

323
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:43,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's not in your plan, it depends on what your plan was, and I don't know what the NCS's plan was on the platform.

324
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:44,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

325
00:30:44,438 --> 00:30:57,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know, but it's different because it has requirements, but it doesn't have such the requirements as the home ARP does, and the home ARP has to, there's

326
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:05,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Qualifying QPs, qualifying participants, where you have to serve all of them.

327
00:31:05,276 --> 00:31:08,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not just like one population.

328
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:11,639
[SPEAKER_07]: It's to prevent homelessness.

329
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:13,639
[SPEAKER_07]: It's to rehouse the unhoused.

330
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:18,081
[SPEAKER_07]: It's veterans, victims of domestic violence.

331
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:26,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's another category, which is hard to define without having it in front of me.

332
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:38,581
[SPEAKER_07]: but those units that are being billed with the combination has to have, has to serve all of those qualifying participants.

333
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:48,427
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that makes sense because initially Walk-Dean could apply for whole funds and then NSC recommended applying for whole amount of funds because they were qualified.

334
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:49,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

335
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:51,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

336
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

337
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,111
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes right up when you Google it.

338
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:55,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the...

339
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun reading.

340
00:31:58,161 --> 00:32:01,063
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

341
00:32:01,123 --> 00:32:04,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else have any other questions about the home program?

342
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:07,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I do.

343
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:18,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So has the consortium thought about using some of their home money for tenant-based rental assistance programs?

344
00:32:21,168 --> 00:32:27,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I know of, but maybe after we finalize the consolidated action plan, they may introduce new programs.

345
00:32:28,471 --> 00:32:37,415
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for those who may not be aware of what the tenant-based rental assistance programs are, is you can use your home money and you can actually

346
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:39,557
[SPEAKER_07]: make a Section 8 program.

347
00:32:39,577 --> 00:32:44,659
[SPEAKER_07]: For a lack of a better description, it can be made very similar to a Section 8 program.

348
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:55,463
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't enter into a lease for more than two years, which not many people do, but it's a nice way.

349
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:08,286
[SPEAKER_07]: When Semerville did it, started 20 plus years ago, they did it where they capped the rental assistance for two years.

350
00:33:08,346 --> 00:33:15,608
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was like the best way to explain it was like a Section 8 with a time clock because you still pay the 30% of your income towards rent.

351
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:18,889
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have a complete tenant selection plan.

352
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,650
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there is some

353
00:33:23,672 --> 00:33:32,375
[SPEAKER_07]: willingness and openness to kind of looking at using some of their home money for a tenant-based rental assistance program.

354
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:33,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that might be the case.

355
00:33:38,778 --> 00:33:40,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one question about home ARP.

356
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a deadline for home ARP?

357
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there an overall, it has to be out of credit?

358
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:47,721
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be spent.

359
00:33:49,342 --> 00:33:51,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, I've got contracts going on until this

360
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:53,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's 2030.

361
00:33:53,456 --> 00:33:56,627
[SPEAKER_07]: It says the allocations were announced on April 8th, 2021.

362
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:23,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and then I think you've got 10, and then I think it's 10 years, I think it's 2030 because I'm just thinking about the contracts that I have, and they're three-year contracts, so they start in 24, it goes to 27, and then I still have, and Somerville still has to do another RFP because we've got all of our service providers asked for all of our money, so we'll have to do another one.

363
00:34:24,825 --> 00:34:25,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's 2020.

364
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:26,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's 2030.

365
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:26,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

366
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:28,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

367
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:36,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody else have any other questions?

368
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:48,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we're going to go to the next topic, which is the action plan.

369
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:55,778
[SPEAKER_07]: The subcommittee is myself, Penny, and Roberta.

370
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:02,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to give a quick little update on what's happening with our action plan?

371
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:13,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a little update, which is the thing that we're getting updates on data and policy movement and compiling those.

372
00:35:13,732 --> 00:35:21,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we've really been working on is setting dates and times and setting up the stakeholder meetings that will happen over the course of the rest of the year.

373
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:25,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think there might be a couple contacts.

374
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:26,339
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still.

375
00:35:27,873 --> 00:35:40,984
[SPEAKER_06]: wrangling up, so potentially we'll do some one-off to ask the other members to stay in contact, but we'll be inviting folks who pick dates for the meetings and are planning out the ask in those meetings.

376
00:35:41,384 --> 00:35:47,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that is perhaps the top-level update of what we've been working on.

377
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

378
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:56,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, the steps that we're looking forward to in this process are

379
00:35:57,552 --> 00:36:08,021
[SPEAKER_02]: doing stakeholder outreach, that is the plan that Penny was just talking about, and we'll do public outreach in January.

380
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:18,530
[SPEAKER_02]: We outlined a timeline, we presented it at the last meeting, so we'll be over the next month thinking about how to advertise a public workshop

381
00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:28,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And also right now we're gathering some background data on demographics and housing data in the area.

382
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:43,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that we might be able to at our next meeting, have a report from city staff on the, where we are with respect to implementing the master plan and the.

383
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:50,114
[SPEAKER_02]: the housing production plan, just to get an update on all of those things.

384
00:36:50,514 --> 00:36:56,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at the background and then we'll do some outreach to gather the needs.

385
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the steps that we're taking right now.

386
00:37:02,543 --> 00:37:05,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to discuss the stakeholder list now?

387
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:13,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say that I'm sorry, I went out of order.

388
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:17,374
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody's looking at the agenda, I went out of order.

389
00:37:17,394 --> 00:37:20,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I skipped the declaration of trust.

390
00:37:20,816 --> 00:37:21,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry.

391
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,458
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get back to that.

392
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:31,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say the yellow highlight ones are still in progress.

393
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them, it looks like we've been pulling them in more.

394
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:35,126
[SPEAKER_06]: The people have been, yeah.

395
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:41,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go back and see if I have the numbers for these.

396
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:44,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll make a note to go back and do this.

397
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:52,156
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe if we could all do a college try to fill out as much information by the end of this week, I think that might be a good deadline for us.

398
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

399
00:37:53,777 --> 00:37:57,659
[SPEAKER_04]: But would it be helpful, maybe, mostly for me?

400
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:02,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I can get these if I contact people who then can get them.

401
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:05,163
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, maybe just give me like, you know, one through

402
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:12,728
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that would be helpful for me, so I could just focus and overwhelm everyone.

403
00:38:12,788 --> 00:38:21,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you could see where my skillset, my line of other people's skillset might be.

404
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:32,259
[SPEAKER_02]: If other people take a look at that list and know any organizations or stakeholders that we've left out, please.

405
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:42,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're reaching out to the stakeholders just right there to obviously gather information.

406
00:38:42,544 --> 00:38:45,605
[SPEAKER_05]: But would that be the list you invite to stakeholder meetings?

407
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:46,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

408
00:38:46,745 --> 00:38:56,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So we scheduled two stakeholder meetings, and we'll ask people to attend either of those two meetings.

409
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:58,888
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be thematically divided.

410
00:38:58,908 --> 00:38:59,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we were

411
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:12,597
[SPEAKER_02]: we landed on having a meeting where we're targeting people about housing development and a separate meeting where we'd be targeting people about housing support services.

412
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:21,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's possible that if that separation doesn't work for people, we might cover them both in both meetings.

413
00:39:23,432 --> 00:39:29,516
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're sending out an email, introduction email, and a do, what is it called?

414
00:39:29,556 --> 00:39:30,376
[SPEAKER_07]: A doodle poll.

415
00:39:30,456 --> 00:39:41,663
[SPEAKER_07]: A doodle poll, so we can at least see who's coming, and then try to gauge the meetings by the attendance.

416
00:39:41,943 --> 00:39:47,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And the combination of our action plan working group and a DT will be attending these meetings.

417
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:49,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Or other staff, yeah, great.

418
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Our excellent staff, so thank you all.

419
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:55,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

420
00:39:57,076 --> 00:40:01,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we'll go back to this with the declaration of trust.

421
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:13,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you again for all your work.

422
00:40:13,442 --> 00:40:15,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are comments from outside counsel.

423
00:40:15,943 --> 00:40:20,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I have reviewed them and maybe we'll just, you know,

424
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:36,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly, I think I'd say a lot of them were very good comments and needed, but mostly form, form these comments, you know, a lot of periods and section, you know, I couldn't, I couldn't do the section on my computer for some reason.

425
00:40:36,338 --> 00:40:42,560
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was all great that she put that in.

426
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,241
[SPEAKER_05]: If I made sure the chair was turning to this, is this 2KB?

427
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:45,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

428
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:45,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharon?

429
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:46,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharon.

430
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:52,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

431
00:40:52,426 --> 00:40:59,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think removal is still... Okay, I just received a response.

432
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,372
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let me read that out.

433
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:16,920
[SPEAKER_01]: So, with respect to removal, there's no requirement for the city council to hold a hearing.

434
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:19,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor can hold their hearing.

435
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:21,123
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what KP law suggested.

436
00:41:22,072 --> 00:41:36,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, mayor begins the removal process by filing a written statement with the city clerk, setting forth the specific reasons for removal, and a copy of that statement is then delivered to the person to be removed.

437
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,383
[SPEAKER_01]: The member to be removed may then file a written reply with the city clerk.

438
00:41:41,863 --> 00:41:51,188
[SPEAKER_01]: At the removal hearing, the mayor or her designee would hear evidence concerning the cause for the removal, in which generally or relatively,

439
00:41:51,972 --> 00:41:52,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

440
00:41:57,478 --> 00:42:06,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are giving examples what could be the reasons for removal and that could include missing meetings, evidencing a conflict of interest,

441
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:09,425
[SPEAKER_01]: or a similar concern.

442
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:22,433
[SPEAKER_01]: There will also be due process considerations to take into account, which provide the board member with notice and an opportunity to be heard on the matter before the removal decision is made.

443
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:27,476
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Neer is the one who will be holding the hearing next.

444
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:44,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking for the other comments.

445
00:42:44,715 --> 00:42:47,377
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the others were resolved in the last meeting.

446
00:42:47,757 --> 00:42:50,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.

447
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,882
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one paragraph.

448
00:42:56,204 --> 00:42:57,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so this is just saying that

449
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:08,322
[SPEAKER_04]: People who sign things and documents on behalf of the trust, this is evidence of the board's will, basically.

450
00:43:08,402 --> 00:43:11,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So, correct authority, that's it.

451
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:16,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I think that was it.

452
00:43:17,704 --> 00:43:19,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Signature of the Court of Trustees.

453
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:26,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other comments?

454
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:32,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have a declaration of drafts.

455
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:36,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what's happening?

456
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:43,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Last time we reviewed this, the question of if anything related to policy advocacy would wind up, should be in this declaration or not.

457
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:45,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we've got that addressed.

458
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:47,015
[SPEAKER_06]: So we put in number 17.

459
00:43:47,055 --> 00:43:48,216
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, that's great.

460
00:43:49,256 --> 00:43:49,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

461
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:50,277
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.

462
00:43:50,597 --> 00:43:51,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to be broad.

463
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:51,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

464
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody have any questions and comments?

465
00:44:05,663 --> 00:44:17,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Just on the process, so this will be cleaned up, and we'll get to read it one more time, and then just probably sign at the end of the next meeting, assuming there's no other changes in the meantime.

466
00:44:18,751 --> 00:44:18,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

467
00:44:18,971 --> 00:44:24,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And before we do that, sort of tagging onto your process, do we have to vote on it?

468
00:44:25,987 --> 00:44:28,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it something that we have to vote to accept?

469
00:44:28,728 --> 00:44:36,411
[SPEAKER_05]: After it's cleaned up, we should probably take a vote to accept at the next meeting and sign assuming we get a unanimous vote.

470
00:44:38,252 --> 00:44:48,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know how you'd handle that at the BCCSO, just in case there's anybody that wants to change or ask a question, ask Karen a new question.

471
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:52,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's going to try to get a final document for the next meeting.

472
00:44:55,188 --> 00:44:55,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you again.

473
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:56,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

474
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,691
[SPEAKER_07]: We're moving along.

475
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:02,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Check.

476
00:45:02,235 --> 00:45:02,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

477
00:45:03,756 --> 00:45:04,217
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.

478
00:45:04,297 --> 00:45:04,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.

479
00:45:06,195 --> 00:45:10,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And the next item on the agenda is funding and grant applications.

480
00:45:11,558 --> 00:45:20,924
[SPEAKER_07]: The trust gave a presentation to the Community Preservation Committee on October 22nd to request funding for $250,000.

481
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:26,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And we hope to get from the committee on the status of the request on December 10th.

482
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:28,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

483
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:35,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair, I'm sorry, that one, the committee will vote on the whole plan for CPA.

484
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:42,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I am thinking of two CPA committees right now.

485
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:53,781
[SPEAKER_02]: At the meeting, the November meeting, the committee is going to begin deliberating, and I think they intend to make their decisions in December.

486
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:56,421
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when they're going to vote on it.

487
00:45:56,481 --> 00:45:56,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

488
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:57,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

489
00:46:09,098 --> 00:46:16,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you put in a good word for us?

490
00:46:16,322 --> 00:46:17,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.

491
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:27,408
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the trust has applied for the Citizens Housing and Planning Association Chappers Municipal Engagement

492
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:33,112
[SPEAKER_07]: initiative through the program.

493
00:46:33,232 --> 00:46:36,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Aditi will provide more information about the application, please.

494
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:42,056
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's CHAPA, Citizens Housing and Planning Association.

495
00:46:42,116 --> 00:46:50,000
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a non-profit organization that provides technical assistance to local communities.

496
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:09,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought it's a good opportunity to apply to this technical assistance program because we have a newly established equitable housing trust and we are developing an action plan.

497
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:12,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do require community support.

498
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:24,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And this program provides community engagement strategies and also facilitate public education efforts to gain support for equitable housing within the community.

499
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:31,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in partnership with Housing Medford, we wrote a grant application.

500
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:38,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is already a municipal engagement initiative community.

501
00:47:39,994 --> 00:47:50,140
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2019, CHAPA helped Housing Medford to establish, I mean, it helped Medford to establish a local housing advocacy group, which is Housing Medford.

502
00:47:51,004 --> 00:48:08,010
[SPEAKER_01]: So as part of our housing production plan, one of the strategies is to collaborate with Housing Medford to reach out to community stakeholders and hear from them what are their needs and how the city can support in building affordable housing.

503
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:14,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought this is a good opportunity to seek their support in moving forward with these initiatives.

504
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:19,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure when we'll hear from them, but fingers crossed.

505
00:48:20,186 --> 00:48:40,897
[SPEAKER_01]: chair how much do we have requests uh it's a technical assistance so there's no funding yes it's a year-long staff support oh wow oh you're long yeah i didn't know that so assuming we're gonna go on positive air and we get approved

506
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:53,163
[SPEAKER_07]: The technical assistance person could help us with the stakeholder meetings and the community meetings to try to help form our action plan.

507
00:48:53,203 --> 00:48:55,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is the aim.

508
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:57,570
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've outlined three main goals.

509
00:48:59,558 --> 00:49:07,484
[SPEAKER_01]: The first goal is to gain community input for the Affordable Housing Trust Action Plan, particularly from harder-to-reach populations.

510
00:49:08,364 --> 00:49:20,894
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second goal is to educate the community about the trust mission, trust role, and the need for equitable housing, and how the community can support the creation of more equitable housing.

511
00:49:21,873 --> 00:49:29,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third goal is to have a continued engagement with the community to convey the surplus city on lawns for affordable housing.

512
00:49:30,936 --> 00:49:31,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

513
00:49:32,357 --> 00:49:36,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we'll hear a positive response from them.

514
00:49:38,919 --> 00:49:40,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for all your comments.

515
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

516
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:48,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody have any questions on the funding application?

517
00:49:52,427 --> 00:49:56,869
[SPEAKER_07]: That brings us to the end of our agenda.

518
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:06,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So here is a housekeeping question because this is a public meeting and it is a public meeting.

519
00:50:06,954 --> 00:50:08,354
[SPEAKER_07]: It says that we're supposed to go to 730.

520
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,796
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't have to go to the end of the meeting.

521
00:50:14,956 --> 00:50:15,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

522
00:50:15,336 --> 00:50:16,277
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't start early.

523
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:16,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

524
00:50:16,537 --> 00:50:16,557
[SPEAKER_07]: 4-6.

525
00:50:16,577 --> 00:50:16,817
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

526
00:50:16,857 --> 00:50:17,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

527
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,677
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess we need a motion to adjourn.

528
00:50:18,697 --> 00:50:19,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

529
00:50:19,857 --> 00:50:20,737
[SPEAKER_07]: All in favor?

530
00:50:20,757 --> 00:50:20,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.
