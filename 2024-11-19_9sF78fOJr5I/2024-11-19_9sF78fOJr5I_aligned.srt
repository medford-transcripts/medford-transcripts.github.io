1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:01,572
Clark-Curtabese, are you ready?

2
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:03,354
I am, Mr. President.

3
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:05,255
Thank you.

4
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:08,378
22nd regular meeting of the Medford City Council will now come to order.

5
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:09,899
Clark-Curtabese, please call the roll.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,980
Councilor Behrs?

7
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:12,121
Present.

8
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:14,003
Vice President Carabiello?

9
00:00:14,323 --> 00:00:14,683
Present.

10
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:16,384
Councilor Knight?

11
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:17,225
Present.

12
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:18,686
Councilor Marks?

13
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:19,707
Present.

14
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:21,429
Councilor Morrell?

15
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:22,369
Present.

16
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:23,991
Councilor Scarpelli?

17
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:24,791
Present.

18
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,233
President Falco?

19
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:28,982
present, all seven members are present.

20
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:32,763
At this point, I would ask everyone to please rise to salute the flag.

21
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:45,987
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22
00:00:54,622 --> 00:01:16,136
Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020, order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, General Law, Chapter 30A, Section 18, and the Governor's March 15, 2020, order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Memphis City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

20-421 offered by Councilor Knight.

30
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:20,259
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the animals- Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt.

31
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,359
I apologize.

32
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:28,864
I needed to let you know at the beginning of the meeting that Councilor Knight has withdrawn paper 20457 from the agenda for this evening.

33
00:02:28,904 --> 00:02:30,465
Okay, thank you.

34
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,426
Motion to suspend the rules, Mr. President.

35
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:35,408
Second, Mr. President.

36
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:39,211
I'm sorry, 20457 has been withdrawn by Councilor Knight.

37
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:40,271
Yes.

38
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:40,992
Thank you.

39
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:43,833
Motion to suspend the rules, Mr. President.

40
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:45,394
Point of information.

41
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:47,736
For what purpose?

42
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:49,957
Papers under suspension.

43
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:59,524
On the motion of, I'm sorry, Councilor Morrell, I missed what you said, I apologize.

44
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:05,609
I was just seeing if there were specific papers, if they could reference the specific papers they want to take out under suspension.

45
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:09,091
The only two papers that I filed under suspension this evening, Mr. President.

46
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:11,636
The first being 20461.

47
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:19,063
Okay, so on the motion to suspend the rules by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

48
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:21,144
Clerk, please call the roll.

49
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:23,727
Councilor Behrs.

50
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,649
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, sir.

51
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,130
I was a no.

52
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,851
Okay.

53
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:33,154
Vice President Caraviello.

54
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:33,695
Yes.

55
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:37,558
Councilor Knight.

56
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,259
Yes.

57
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:41,443
Councilor Marks?

58
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:42,224
Yes.

59
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:45,866
Councilor Morrell?

60
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:46,527
No.

61
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:49,649
Councilor Scarpelli?

62
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:50,709
Yes.

63
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:54,112
President Falco?

64
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:54,892
No.

65
00:03:55,973 --> 00:04:01,196
So for the affirmative, three in the negative, the rules are suspended for 20-461.

66
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:02,937
It was offered by Council tonight.

67
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:05,419
And I'm sorry, 20-459, which is offered by

68
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,371
consular marks.

69
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:16,618
So those two papers are, they were often under suspension.

70
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:18,179
Technically,

71
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:20,525
due to the open meeting.

72
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:22,207
If I may, Mr. President, before you start.

73
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:23,948
Yes, Councilor Knight.

74
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:26,070
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

75
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,253
I'm sure that this is a topic that's something that could be ruled out of order.

76
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:34,837
I'm sure that you are inclined to do such based upon the late filing of the paper alone.

77
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:41,001
With that being said, Mr. President, this paper does attempt to address a concern that's been raised by the council.

78
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:44,184
And I do think it does warrant further discussion and deliberation.

79
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:51,196
The question remains, Mr. President, is if the paper's ruled out of order, what direction can we go in later on?

80
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:56,642
And if the paper's ruled out of order and that motion stands, then this can't be reintroduced for 90 days.

81
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:03,329
In the interest, Mr. President, I think we're all aware of the situation and the circumstances as to what it is we're looking for here.

82
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:07,433
I'm hoping that we can table this paper until next week, Mr. President.

83
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:19,415
There's a lot of concern about people that haven't had an opportunity to participate, whether it be in the school department meetings or in the city council meetings, and the level of participation and the platform that's being used doesn't work for them.

84
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:23,016
And I can certainly agree that the platform has been difficult.

85
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:29,317
I've had a number of technical difficulties myself with it, and we've talked to a number of people, Mr. President, about this.

86
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:37,779
So with that being said, there is a matter that's before us here, and I think that it's important that it be given the proper consideration.

87
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,583
And I'm offering an olive branch here, Mr. President.

88
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:55,623
I'd be willing to table this measure this evening and request that yourself as the Council President, Council Caviello as the Vice President, meet with representatives from the administration, the Director of the Board of Health,

89
00:05:56,295 --> 00:06:13,406
Patrick Gordon, and the mayor, to see if there's a way that we can improve the way that we're doing business here and to improve the virtual platform, the ability for us to have public participation and public input live in some capacity or some way, whether that be a hybrid with Zoom or not, Mr. President.

90
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:22,012
But I'm asking that this matter be tabled this evening with the conditions that, you know, you and Councilor Caviello meet with those individuals from the administration.

91
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:24,254
You give it one shot, Mr. President.

92
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:25,535
Meet for one hour tomorrow.

93
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:27,317
If we can work something out, that's great.

94
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:33,582
If not, I'd be happy to be bound by the determination that's made by the vice president, the council president, and most parties.

95
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,788
But I think, Mr. President, this is a topic that there are a number of people in the community that have expressed a great deal of concern about.

96
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:46,394
There's been a lot of back-and-forth and division in the city of Metro right now about the way that we're conducting business.

97
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,859
And I think it warrants another look to see if we can do better.

98
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,444
With that being said, Mr. President, I also see that we're under a timeline.

99
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:56,067
There is a crunch that we're facing here.

100
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:58,010
There are a number of procedural concerns that were raised.

101
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,933
There are a number of operational concerns that were raised.

102
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:04,029
You know, the Medford City Council is a government body.

103
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:11,258
It's a governmental body, and it has to respect and adhere to certain processes that are going to be in the best interest of the citizenry.

104
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,604
That coupled with the fact that, you know, social media isn't a government body.

105
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:18,588
Those platforms do not have to be held to the same

106
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:25,774
criteria and standards when it comes down to us conducting business versus the way that matters are bantered back and forth, Mr. President.

107
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:40,146
I just think that right now it would make more sense for us to put this item on the table, allow the two leaders that we've elected here in the City Council who are on opposite ends of an issue to come together and meet with the administration and try to work out a plan.

108
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,428
I'm asking for 60 minutes tomorrow.

109
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:47,776
but the two leaders of this council to meet with those individuals from the administration, Mr. President.

110
00:07:48,416 --> 00:08:00,808
And if we can move forward in that fashion and you guys can have one last shot at trying to improve the way that we allow the public to participate, I'll be happy to be bound by any determination or any outcome of that one hour meeting that takes place tomorrow.

111
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:22,995
So, with that being said, Mr. President, I do appreciate you entertaining me with the ability to present my position on this matter and why I brought it forward, ultimately bringing it forward to address some transparency issues that have been brought up, to address some procedural issues that have been brought up, and to allow for a call for more public participation that's live in real time.

112
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:25,498
So with that being said, Mr. President.

113
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:38,735
Just a point of clarification that the president had previously met and addressed a previously voted on resolution and more than 200 individuals have come out to previously scheduled meetings.

114
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:40,438
So I just want that to be on the record.

115
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:44,795
Mr. President, I think that that's absolutely great and perfectly clear.

116
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:54,920
And if you had met and talked to people about that, and there was no way that we could conduct this plan, and you brought that back to the body, and we sat down and had a meeting, and that was explained to us, I think that that would be great.

117
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,301
But that's not what happened.

118
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:04,005
So with that being said, Mr. President, that this isn't an issue that we're trying to create an internal fight and further divide the community on.

119
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:08,287
And I'm not sitting there saying, Zach and Nicole and John are wrong because they showed up at meetings.

120
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:10,148
That's not what I'm doing, Mr. President.

121
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:13,110
And I'd expect my council colleagues to not do the same.

122
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,472
What I am saying is that there's a concern here.

123
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:18,115
This concern was brought up, and it came out rapid, very fast.

124
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:19,716
There wasn't much time to address it.

125
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:22,919
And I took a stand, Mr. President, and I stand by that vote that I took.

126
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:28,904
I felt as though it was important that people be provided an opportunity to present live and talk about the concerns that they have.

127
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:36,661
and they don't have the opportunity to come to a school committee meeting and face the people that laid them off, I think that that's a problem.

128
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:44,507
So with that being said, Mr. President, I've offered this proposal in an effort to try to build a bridge between the two positions of where we're at.

129
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:58,257
And I understand the crunch of time that we're on, so I think that that's a great compromise solution that I'm offering, that you and Council Vice President Caviello meet with those three individuals tomorrow, sit down, try to hash out a plan where there can be more public

130
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:04,279
participation in a live setting in one fashion or another, and we can move on from there, Mr. President.

131
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:06,960
I'd be happy to be bound by the findings of that committee.

132
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:19,965
However, at this point in time, you know, based upon the series of events and circumstances that arose, I didn't feel as though I was informed, I didn't feel as though there was a great good – there was a good deal of communication, and I took a stand, Mr. President.

133
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,787
And, you know, if I feel something – if there's something that I think I should stand up for,

134
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:25,668
I will, and that's what I did.

135
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:31,170
And, you know, and I've got to look in the mirror every morning and shave my face before I, you know, before I leave the House, Mr. President.

136
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,331
And that's one of the biggest tests for a politician.

137
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:34,732
Can you look in the mirror every day?

138
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:38,354
And I always have been able to, and I will continue to do so as long as I serve.

139
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:53,501
But with that being said, Mr. President, I offer this proposal that we table this, and the Joint Council of Caviello Meet, for the purpose of conducting a small meeting, one hour in length, with Marian O'Connor, with Mayor Lungo Kern.

140
00:10:54,001 --> 00:11:05,428
and with Patrick Gordon, the Director of Community Media, to see if there's ways that we can improve the in-person or real-time public participation of our council meetings, especially relative to the budget hearings, Mr. President.

141
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,850
I think that's really what my main focus is on, is the budget hearings.

142
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,151
Point of information.

143
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:09,771
Through the rest of it.

144
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,232
Thank you, Councilor.

145
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:12,973
Point of information, Councilor Morrell.

146
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,014
Thank you, Mr. President.

147
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:18,377
Is the motion to table this resolution, or is the motion to amend this resolution?

148
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:26,981
The motion is to be tabled under the conditions that the Council President and the Council Vice President agreed to take these steps.

149
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,942
And I think that that's a good compromise.

150
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:32,425
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

151
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:33,766
Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

152
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:34,467
Did you have a question?

153
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,809
Yeah, just is this a paper in order, Mr. President?

154
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:43,994
So the paper, as far as I'm concerned, the paper is not in order.

155
00:11:44,674 --> 00:11:47,876
I would ask that it be tabled and put on the agenda next week.

156
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:58,320
As far as Councilor Knight's question about meeting with the administration, I have sent emails off to the Board of Health Director earlier today.

157
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,482
I talked to Patrick Gordon earlier today.

158
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:06,083
There were very brief conversations.

159
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:11,598
My opinion is this, I know we need to get this done.

160
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,118
We need to pass a budget.

161
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:18,859
We are against really hard time, a tough deadline now.

162
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,120
So we need to get this done.

163
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,920
We need to work together.

164
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,081
But in my eyes, Zoom needs to be a component of this.

165
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,102
It absolutely needs to be a component.

166
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:36,223
At the past three budget meetings that we had or attempted to have, this morning I believe, I'm sorry,

167
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,669
But an hour ago, we had 189, close to 200 people on the call.

168
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,711
Last night, it was close to 90.

169
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:48,893
Saturday morning, 50 people.

170
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:53,457
50 people jumped on the call on Saturday morning to listen to a budget hearing.

171
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:58,541
I have to be honest with you, in all my years of city government, I've never seen that much interest in the budget.

172
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:01,684
It's nice to see people are involved.

173
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:03,886
They want to be part of the process.

174
00:13:04,306 --> 00:13:04,926
That's great.

175
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:05,627
I love it.

176
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,341
And I'm happy that everyone attended.

177
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,384
It's unfortunate that we couldn't have the meeting, but I'm happy that everyone attended.

178
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:25,195
And so I don't mind personally meeting with Vice President Carvillo, the mayor's office, you know, Marian O'Connor, Patrick Gordon, to see if this is something that can happen.

179
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:30,139
But I will state again, Zoom has to be part of the process.

180
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,621
And more than willing to-

181
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:38,578
Councilor Marks, I think I heard your voice.

182
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:39,719
Thank you, Mr. President.

183
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:48,807
Not to interrupt you, but it's always been the intention of, I believe, all seven councilors to have Zoom part of any process.

184
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:49,949
Point of information.

185
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,911
Point of information, Councilor Morrell.

186
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:56,915
The paper that's being discussed does not reference Zoom, and that's why it's coming up.

187
00:13:58,229 --> 00:13:59,310
Point of information, Mr. President.

188
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,531
Mr. President, just if I could finish my point of information.

189
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,632
Okay, Councilor Marks.

190
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:05,173
Just if I could, with all due respect.

191
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:15,739
Over the last several days, I've received a number of emails, which I welcome, much of which spoke about us as a council not wanting to have Zoom as an option.

192
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,722
which is the furthest from the truth, Mr. President.

193
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:31,800
So I just want to let it be known that I as one member of the council, my council colleagues will speak for themselves, never once mentioned to stop council meetings on Zoom, stop budget meetings, it was to provide an additional avenue

194
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:33,202
to our meetings.

195
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:40,628
So even if we did hold in-council meetings with department heads, those meetings would have been televised.

196
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:43,250
They would have been available to Zoom for comments.

197
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,592
They would have been available to Zoom for email.

198
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,455
They would have been all open access, Mr. President, as council members.

199
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:55,099
And if I can also mention, Mr. President, this is my 25th budget.

200
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,761
That means 25 years.

201
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,563
I take my job very serious, Mr. President.

202
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:01,896
And I don't take it lightly.

203
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:05,958
I've never missed a budget in 25 years, Mr. President.

204
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,462
And what happened recently, Mr. President, I think was unfortunate.

205
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:21,048
And my concern right now, Mr. President, is moving forward, getting past this, Mr. President, and offering people no one wants to do a wayward zone.

206
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:23,970
Anyone that's telling you that hasn't been true to you.

207
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:26,252
We are not doing a wayward zone.

208
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:40,861
There are, as many business people know, and other people that are in the business world and so forth, there's a lot of complexity to putting together a budget, especially a budget that's 183 million, that deals with potentially hundreds of layoffs.

209
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:52,608
And to work that type of budget over a Zoom meeting, for us to be present with each other- Mr. President, would be-

210
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:54,737
Can we get the screen clear?

211
00:15:59,438 --> 00:15:59,798
Thank you.

212
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,099
Sorry, Councilor Marks.

213
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,620
Councilor Marks, please continue.

214
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,625
Mr. President, this was a point of information, but what I'm saying, Mr. President, there's a lot of things that go on in a budget.

215
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:15,368
There's sidebar conversations that we've had in the council when we discuss issues.

216
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:18,770
There's a lot of things when we sit down and talk to department heads.

217
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,553
Now, Mr. President, if one minute someone felt the department head that they were unsafe,

218
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:26,375
Those are the things we'd have to address, Mr. President.

219
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:30,718
And maybe having a meeting is not the greatest idea in public.

220
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:40,005
But I can tell you in the town of Canton and the town of Abington, they just recently, within the last couple of days, have held meetings with their town councils.

221
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:50,453
And they address situations of social distancing, of providing masks, sanitary gloves, and so forth, whatever they needed to do to address.

222
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:58,675
And all I'm saying is, I think we could have tried to accomplish that in the city of Meffitt, and also keeping Zoom and every other realm of communication.

223
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:01,396
If there's another one out there, that's you, Mr. President.

224
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:03,656
You yourself know we've opened up.

225
00:17:03,976 --> 00:17:10,558
We've never had our budget meetings, since I've been on in 24 years, open other than arriving to City Hall.

226
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:15,639
And I realize this is a different time, arriving to City Hall and have people participate in person.

227
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:20,981
Now for the first time, we have cameras in our council room that can capture these meetings.

228
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:27,143
There is no way members of the council want to hide anything from the public, exclude the public, Mr. President.

229
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,944
So I just want to put that out there.

230
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:33,026
I know there's been a lot of information back and forth, and it makes for a good story.

231
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,467
Certain people don't want to attend meetings.

232
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:39,009
But I can tell you, Mr. President, that's not the case.

233
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:41,230
It's not the case with me, Mr. President.

234
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,411
I look forward to moving forward.

235
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:48,293
And as I've told people that contacted me, you can rest assured we're going to have a signed budget.

236
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:53,936
We're going to have open debate, open dialogue, open comments, and we're going to have a signed budget, Mr. President.

237
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,517
Thank you for indulging me for those few minutes.

238
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:57,158
I appreciate it.

239
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:58,138
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

240
00:17:58,158 --> 00:17:59,399
Mr. President, point of information.

241
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:01,060
Point of information, Councilor Pierce.

242
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,762
I respect what Councilor Marks said, but the paper in front of us right here doesn't have Zoom in it.

243
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,492
It says email and phone only.

244
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:15,154
My understanding, COVID orders, members, department heads, and members of the public need to be able to participate remotely.

245
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:19,555
We're gonna end up after tomorrow's meeting, if there is one, it seems like that's the direction it's going.

246
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:22,736
We're gonna end up after tomorrow's meeting in the place we were last week.

247
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:26,276
But instead of two weeks to debate a budget, we're gonna have one week to debate a budget.

248
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:28,037
So we're gonna end up where we were.

249
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,152
You know, I need to be able to participate by Zoom.

250
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:37,656
And quite frankly, hundreds of people have participated and have been very angry that these meetings haven't moved forward.

251
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:39,297
We're just going to be where we were with less time.

252
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:42,359
So I'm very disappointed in the actions that have been taken.

253
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:44,586
Board of Information Counsel Marks.

254
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:45,546
Thank you.

255
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:51,249
And I know my two colleagues have expressed themselves many times on social media and Twitter and so forth.

256
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,991
However, Mr. President, this is the Memphis City Council meeting.

257
00:18:55,651 --> 00:19:04,396
And I think at the very least, it deserves the opportunity, Mr. President, to explore, which we asked for well over a month ago, to explore what options are out there.

258
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:08,019
And all I'm saying is we need the time to explore it, Mr. President.

259
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:14,064
The mayor has already come out asking us, saying if we're unable to get together on this, she's going to have to do a 1-12 budget.

260
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:16,687
That would be her wishes, not my wish.

261
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:18,809
I think we can resolve this, Mr. President.

262
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:20,290
I think we can get together.

263
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:25,871
And according to what Councilor Knight mentioned, that we're willing to stand by whatever the recommendation is.

264
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:35,033
And that includes the Mayor's recommendation, her Board of Health, the President of the Council, the gentleman from Local Access, and the Vice President.

265
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:38,794
So whatever the recommendations are, Mr. President, that's what we're gonna stand by.

266
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:45,796
And if it includes not having the public meeting at City Hall, then as far as I'm concerned, so be it, Mr. President.

267
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:50,476
So I don't see how this is going to wait another week, Mr. President.

268
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:58,440
And if anything, maybe these public meetings should have been called one after another because you have a 48-hour wait period.

269
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,162
So maybe these meetings should have been called so we do have meetings scheduled for the next couple of days.

270
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:09,305
And I would ask, Mr. President, that maybe that's something you look at so we do have meetings set up.

271
00:20:09,946 --> 00:20:10,726
Thank you very much.

272
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:14,828
Mr. President, motion while we're under suspension to take public participation out of order.

273
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:16,938
We're not we're not done yet council here.

274
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:17,459
So one minute.

275
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:17,759
Okay.

276
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,282
Um Council vice president cabrio.

277
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:22,183
Thank you.

278
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:22,743
Mr. President.

279
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:28,888
Um, uh, I I thank uh council night for putting this all a branch forward Uh in the effort that we move on.

280
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:39,937
Uh, there's a reason why council mark's been there for 25 years Uh just by his statements, uh, this is this you know He has the wisdom that many other people want on this council.

281
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,178
Don't i'm uh, uh

282
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:47,926
I'm the second-ranking person there, but I have nothing in the amount of years that Councillor Mark says.

283
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:56,858
And again, if there isn't anything he said that's not true, and I agree with Paul Hartley, this is a time to learn to heal.

284
00:20:57,578 --> 00:20:59,399
I'll be happy to meet tomorrow, whatever time.

285
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:06,520
We'll sit, we'll discuss this, and whatever the decision is, the decision is, and we'll move on from there.

286
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:12,762
So I'm happy to be of assistance to yourself, Mr. President, and everyone else on the council, yeah.

287
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:14,802
Thank you, Vice President Carvajal.

288
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:16,683
Mr. President, point of information.

289
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:18,783
Point of information, Council of Peers.

290
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:20,904
Are people shutting off the video?

291
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:22,964
People are saying their video is being shut off.

292
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:31,032
I'm just getting a lot of messages that people's videos are being shut off for holding up messages, so I hope that's not happening.

293
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:36,313
I haven't touched anything, so I try to keep it simple.

294
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,454
Mute, unmute, and that's about it.

295
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:41,754
Mr. President, I have not shut off any videos either.

296
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:43,575
Okay, I haven't shut off videos, so.

297
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:46,315
I'm really disappointed in that action that's happening right now.

298
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:53,537
I haven't shut off anything, so just to let you know, Council Appears, I haven't touched anybody's video.

299
00:21:55,041 --> 00:22:08,659
It's for just for everyone's effect anyone who's a co-host can do it and it seems like some of us aren't doing it Well, I have not I for one other can state that I have not touched anyone's video First of all, because I don't personally I probably don't I don't even know how to do it

300
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:11,669
Thank you, Mr. President.

301
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:13,029
Ditto, Mr. President.

302
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:13,910
If I can indulge you.

303
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,850
Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

304
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,891
Thank you, Mr. President.

305
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:25,314
And I appreciate you entertaining the option of Council night's resolution and tabling.

306
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:33,718
So obviously, this is a lightning rod that we've gotten multiple emails, multiple phone calls.

307
00:22:40,155 --> 00:22:57,030
In times of disarray, and we're looking at these times, probably the worst budget in Memphis history, we received phone calls from multiple people, emails, I'm sure my colleagues have, about the fear that they would not be heard.

308
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:03,536
And the focus on myself, speaking for myself, was never

309
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:14,628
was never to drown anybody out, to hurt our committee, to not to stop some sort of a process.

310
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:20,543
We were elected as elected officials to make sure every person is heard.

311
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:27,386
And believe me, I appreciate the 200 people to 300 people that are on calls, and we've been on calls together.

312
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:37,271
But the understanding was very simple, just to make sure we can spend some time to make sure that we could find an avenue that everybody is heard.

313
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:39,892
Now, that's no slight to you, Mr. President.

314
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:41,493
I know you've tried very hard.

315
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:51,506
But this is something we have to look at either with the mayor and the city administration, yourself, our counselors, the four that haven't shown up to the budget.

316
00:23:51,886 --> 00:23:53,890
These are issues that we have to address.

317
00:23:55,155 --> 00:24:04,022
But I think what's important right now is that we work together to try to get this budget heard with the people in place.

318
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:20,776
And again, I'm going to follow with my colleagues and say, as we move forward, I know the constituents that elected George Scott Pelley understand my integrity, my desire, and my love for this community, that I'm going to do what's best for every single person.

319
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:22,217
And to be honest with you,

320
00:24:23,098 --> 00:24:25,438
I'm sure that's true with everybody on our council.

321
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:39,661
So to see and hear the negativity, because a group doesn't believe in the same beliefs that you do, that they want to make this a different issue.

322
00:24:39,941 --> 00:24:42,541
I've been saying this for weeks, council president.

323
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:52,463
Please, please, to my colleagues in the city council, please, to my colleagues on the school committee, do not divide this community.

324
00:24:53,863 --> 00:25:01,099
And what has happened is something simple as a process, a simple process to make sure everybody is heard.

325
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:26,382
has turned into an ugly creature in our community that I've been called, my credibility's thrown out, that this council of four members have been looking to do something underhanded, or that I'm stopping the process of something that a group wants to speak about, or the fact that I'm racist because of this, and the best one ever, my kids love this one, because of my weight.

326
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:32,068
that some reason that I didn't show up to these meetings because of my weight.

327
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:35,371
So it's absolutely comical.

328
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:37,893
I love the city of Medford.

329
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:46,980
I've done everything as a teacher, as a coach, as a volunteer, as a school kid member, as a city council to do what's right for the city of Medford.

330
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:50,742
We've had some divide in this community.

331
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:56,167
A few weeks ago, there were some issues about an issue that came through the school committee.

332
00:25:57,127 --> 00:26:02,252
that I will publicly say I don't disagree or I don't agree.

333
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:12,683
But the problem that brought this issue forward was the lack of transparency that people that wanted to be heard couldn't be heard because things were pushed through.

334
00:26:14,265 --> 00:26:16,907
So whether you believe in the issue or not, that's not the point.

335
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:19,870
The point is, when I started in this position,

336
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:27,191
When we started together on the school committee, we made sure we were the platform for every single citizen.

337
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:33,273
And what we saw and what we're seeing now is an organization dividing our community.

338
00:26:33,614 --> 00:26:35,534
And we need to find a way to fix that.

339
00:26:35,935 --> 00:26:41,197
We need to find a way to meet with organization people from that group and sit together.

340
00:26:41,217 --> 00:26:43,178
Because I've talked to a few of them just recently.

341
00:26:44,347 --> 00:26:47,590
and had great conversation, had to understand, to agree, to disagree.

342
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:53,715
We're all on the same page.

343
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:56,978
There's just a group and an organization that keeps on being referenced.

344
00:26:57,058 --> 00:26:57,639
I'm not sure.

345
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:00,101
I don't understand who's being referenced or being addressed.

346
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:07,771
When I find out that group, Mr. President, I'm sure I'll share with it because I haven't been directed exactly what that group is.

347
00:27:08,031 --> 00:27:11,273
This is what I've been told from phone calls and emails that I've been getting.

348
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:16,356
So when I do find out, I would love to share with everybody in the community.

349
00:27:16,396 --> 00:27:23,020
But right now, this committee, our city council, right now, needs to find a way

350
00:27:24,465 --> 00:27:27,247
needs to find a way to bring this group together.

351
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:30,269
I've had too many phone calls telling me, what happened to Medford?

352
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,171
Why are we so, why are we split?

353
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:41,838
So I think right now, Mr. President, with your leadership, I think moving this forward and people understanding, listen, you don't have to agree with me.

354
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:43,659
That's okay, that's the process.

355
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:56,352
But to understand, to think that I was delinquent in my duties, I applaud my duties because I work for every member, not for people that have their agenda and hope to push that agenda forward, Mr. President.

356
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:58,252
So I thank you for listening to us.

357
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:01,873
I understand this last week has been troublesome for everybody.

358
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:11,435
We've had a lot of sleepless nights, but at the same time, I think we have something on the table that if you can, you and Counselor Carviello can work the administration,

359
00:28:11,915 --> 00:28:17,378
And again, Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks said, I will gladly follow your lead moving forward.

360
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:26,262
The people that have asked to be heard, they know that we put forth that concern, and we have to move on with that.

361
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:27,643
So thank you for your time.

362
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:29,224
Mr. President.

363
00:28:29,704 --> 00:28:30,404
Thank you, Council.

364
00:28:30,424 --> 00:28:31,645
Scott Pelle, Council of Peers.

365
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:37,184
I just think if we're going to be slinging accusations and calling people dividing the city, let's, let's name it.

366
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:37,524
Right.

367
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,125
I, I don't know what you're talking about.

368
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:44,426
If you're talking about our revolution, Medford, I think that's an insult to people who are organized.

369
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:45,146
Okay.

370
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:47,947
Well, you're, you're saying that people are dividing the city.

371
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:51,908
You're saying that other counselors are doing it and where the other counselors who showed up to the meetings.

372
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,021
I'm just saying, I don't want a divided city.

373
00:28:56,121 --> 00:29:02,585
I think that people, I think that point of information, I didn't name a counselor.

374
00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:04,145
I didn't name an organization.

375
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:09,729
If my fellow counselor feels guilty about something, then he should feel guilty.

376
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,830
Mr. President, I think it's a shame.

377
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,172
I think it's a shame that people organizing for their community are, are belittled.

378
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:17,133
I think it's a shame.

379
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:20,795
So I'm going to keep showing up to meetings, Mr. President, and I, I'm sure there'll be on zoom.

380
00:29:21,296 --> 00:29:22,078
Thank you, Mr. President.

381
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:23,945
Thank you, Councilor Piers, Councilor Morrell.

382
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:25,530
I'm glad everybody thinks this is funny.

383
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,360
Thank you, Mr. President.

384
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:31,562
I do want to note that I do get frustrated by Zoom sometimes.

385
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:33,463
I've had a few times where I've had my hands up.

386
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:37,645
And I know when we have such high attendance, it's hard to see everyone with their hand up.

387
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:41,006
And it's a little different if we're in the chambers and I were able to push the button and get online.

388
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:45,488
But these are things that have to be done because we are still very much in the middle of a pandemic.

389
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:50,230
I know things are being shared about how many budgets people have done.

390
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,270
This is my first budget.

391
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,072
But like every other counselor, this is my first budget during a pandemic.

392
00:29:56,072 --> 00:30:02,013
I've only lived in Medford for seven years, but I've lived here long enough to hear the phrase Medford is not XY or Z city.

393
00:30:02,513 --> 00:30:09,195
So while I appreciate that the city of Canton met in person, I think we as Medford can identify a way to move forward.

394
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:11,495
One way actually has been previously identified.

395
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:19,577
I have been at the meetings, but I do welcome the president's absolute willingness to work with every counselor and lead on this.

396
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:29,780
the fact that many members of the public and members of the council and department heads and the administration have been on three budget meetings that did not go on.

397
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:30,941
So thank you.

398
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:32,721
Mr. President, point of information.

399
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:33,861
It'll be my last one.

400
00:30:35,942 --> 00:30:44,285
I just want to also add and inform the public as well that if we're talking about dividing the city, there are elected officials who have had threats made against them in the past two weeks.

401
00:30:44,545 --> 00:30:47,866
There are elected officials who have the police watching their house in the past two weeks.

402
00:30:48,396 --> 00:30:57,662
So yes, there are people in this community who are making threats because the democratic process isn't sufficient for their beliefs.

403
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,042
And I think that's a shame.

404
00:31:00,103 --> 00:31:02,004
And I just want people to know that, that's where we are.

405
00:31:02,565 --> 00:31:03,385
People are getting threats.

406
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:04,786
So we need to do better.

407
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:06,347
Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

408
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,549
So it seems like all the councilors have spoken.

409
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:10,810
So if I may.

410
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,930
If I could, Mr. President.

411
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,951
Councilor Marks.

412
00:31:14,232 --> 00:31:23,917
I need to say, Mr. President, I remember a day when there used to be some disagreements and counselors would argue about issues.

413
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:30,721
But what I have to say, Mr. President, is this council is going in a very different direction.

414
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:39,586
It's a little troubling when a member of the council offers a resolution and other counselors prior to it even being discussed

415
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:45,815
on the agenda, start bashing a member of the council for offering a resolution.

416
00:31:46,676 --> 00:31:56,260
Not even listening, like they'll talk a big game saying, I want to hear what people have to say, but they start bashing someone before you have to hear what they say.

417
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,661
Point of information got somewhere else.

418
00:31:58,942 --> 00:32:01,083
The resolution being discussed wasn't on the agenda.

419
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:02,543
It was submitted under suspension.

420
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:06,005
I'm not referring to the resolution, but thank you for your comment.

421
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:11,503
Mr. President, so what I'm saying, Mr. President, is very troubling.

422
00:32:11,543 --> 00:32:13,045
Everyone's entitled to their own opinion.

423
00:32:13,546 --> 00:32:21,237
But to start this back and forth, Mr. President, without listening, God gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason, Mr. President.

424
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:33,326
And without listening to see what someone else has to say, we're never going to move forward, Mr. President, because we can't debate stuff on Twitter and email and all those other services, Mr. President.

425
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:34,967
That's not how we operate.

426
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:39,911
And I realize these are two new councils, and they're not privy to how maybe the council operates.

427
00:32:40,331 --> 00:32:44,772
but just for future, Mr. President, moving forward, have respect for other people.

428
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:46,832
You may not agree what they have to say.

429
00:32:46,852 --> 00:32:48,533
You may hate their resolution.

430
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:54,334
You may despise what they're saying, but give them the opportunity to say it and then have your say.

431
00:32:54,634 --> 00:32:56,475
That's all I'm saying this morning.

432
00:32:56,815 --> 00:32:57,875
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

433
00:32:58,315 --> 00:32:59,875
Can we try to keep this to the budget?

434
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:02,696
Okay, that's the number one focus is the budget.

435
00:33:02,736 --> 00:33:06,657
So if we could just try to keep this to the budget, I'd greatly appreciate it.

436
00:33:06,697 --> 00:33:07,377
Councilor Marks?

437
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:13,234
I will stop after this, but I just want to say that I have very much respect to this, this council on this body.

438
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:15,536
And that's why I showed up to the three budget meetings.

439
00:33:16,057 --> 00:33:19,780
Thank you for the last three days.

440
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,261
Thank you, Mr. President.

441
00:33:21,662 --> 00:33:30,170
Um, I think, I think it's respecting the public and the people of Medford to let them know what's on the agenda or what's being proposed and how counselors feel about it.

442
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,612
I think keeping people in the dark is wrong.

443
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:34,179
So that's why I did what I did.

444
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:40,222
If this had been posted on the agenda, or if we had had the time to put this on the agenda, that's how I would have approached it.

445
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:42,783
I respect the people of Menford knowing what's going on.

446
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:45,884
And this has been a very tense weekend, as we all know.

447
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:48,426
Sleepless nights, I think Councillor Scarpelli said.

448
00:33:48,906 --> 00:33:51,327
So people asked what was happening.

449
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:53,668
I told them what was happening to the best of my ability.

450
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,369
And to be quite frank, I took

451
00:33:55,836 --> 00:34:00,958
special efforts, not to make it personal about other counselors, not to name other counselors.

452
00:34:01,318 --> 00:34:04,620
Even if people ask me who showed up and who didn't, I didn't answer that question.

453
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,743
So I just want to say that to the public of Medford, I did what I did because I think you have a right to know, and I think we need to move forward.

454
00:34:11,903 --> 00:34:12,903
And that's why I did it.

455
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:16,104
So respect to the council and respect to the people is behind my actions.

456
00:34:16,484 --> 00:34:17,525
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

457
00:34:18,385 --> 00:34:19,406
Vice President Carvajal.

458
00:34:19,686 --> 00:34:20,386
Thank you, Mr. President.

459
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:23,568
Mr. President, respect to the people, respect to my fellow counselors.

460
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:33,135
I think we need to end this discussion at this point because it's a, like you said, we're going in a direction that wasn't intended.

461
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:39,739
So again, I'm open to meeting with you and whatever you want to do tomorrow and we'll adhere to whatever decision.

462
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,659
if that's what everybody wants to do, Mr. President.

463
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,140
We're going to sit here and call names at each other all night.

464
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,461
Again, this isn't the council that I want to be elected to.

465
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:54,063
I mean, I ran to be everybody's councillors, not just certain people's councillors.

466
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:56,904
So, again, I'm here for- So did we all.

467
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:57,764
So did we all, Mr. President.

468
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,444
I'm sure you did.

469
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:01,225
Everybody thinks this is a funny and a joke.

470
00:35:01,545 --> 00:35:02,225
It's not a joke.

471
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:03,445
It's serious business.

472
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,626
Yeah, that's why I showed up.

473
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:06,326
That's right.

474
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:07,086
I'm glad you showed up.

475
00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:09,047
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

476
00:35:11,894 --> 00:35:13,295
Thank you to all the council members.

477
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:27,181
If I may, just a quick, you know, I think a number of council has said sleepless nights, restless nights, the past week has not been easy.

478
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:36,105
You know, making the decision to, you know, have the meetings was made, you know, with the guide to public health.

479
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:39,607
You know, when I talked to Marianne O'Connor that she pleaded

480
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,431
with me not to do it.

481
00:35:41,991 --> 00:35:42,751
For me, that was it.

482
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:44,352
She's a public health director.

483
00:35:44,372 --> 00:35:50,235
When she told me public health, she pleaded with me not to do it.

484
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,556
And at that point in time, that's a public health expert.

485
00:35:53,636 --> 00:35:58,398
I will be the first to admit, I am not a public health professional, not even close.

486
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:05,461
So I needed to make sure that, for safety's sake, that everybody was safe.

487
00:36:08,386 --> 00:36:17,468
I will work my hardest because, to be honest with you, and I've always said this, and I know people laugh at me sometimes, you know, to me it's always like, you know, we need to be one method.

488
00:36:17,528 --> 00:36:18,869
We need to come together.

489
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:20,469
We need to work together.

490
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:32,512
And over the years as my elected, as I've been elected official, six years in the school committee, about five now on the council, you know, there's been a lot of teamwork, a lot of working together.

491
00:36:32,812 --> 00:36:36,753
And a lot of times, you know what, we would agree to disagree, but you move on to the next issue.

492
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:39,900
I think what we need to do is we need to work together on this.

493
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:48,065
I am more than happy to give this one more shot just to take a look, to see if this is something that we can do.

494
00:36:48,806 --> 00:37:04,375
So I will set up a meeting tomorrow with Marianne O'Connor, our public health director, the mayor, or at least a representative from the mayor's office, Patrick Gordon from the cable TV, and vice president Carvial.

495
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:13,817
I will look to see if there's some way to enhance this, I guess.

496
00:37:14,158 --> 00:37:19,681
But to me, like I said, Zoom has to be an option, which it seems like everybody's on board with that.

497
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:21,763
Zoom must be an option.

498
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:24,767
100%, Mr. President.

499
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,468
Whatever plan that the parties can agree to, Mr. President.

500
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:32,191
I don't think anything, nothing in the proposal that I put forward was to exclude Zoom, Mr. President.

501
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:36,634
It was just to say that that's a platform that might not work and there may be other platforms that are better.

502
00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:42,197
Zoom could have been used for the call-in portion of the public participation, for example.

503
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:52,243
So, you know, nothing limited this to Zoom, but my concern was that I wanted to be in the same room with the people that were making the cuts so that I could look them in the eye and ask them the questions that I need to ask, Mr. President.

504
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:56,985
Then there's another layer of concern with the public participation process.

505
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:57,886
It's twofold.

506
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:07,850
But as I've said before, in an effort to move past this issue and to negotiate some sort of compromise that's good for all of us, I offered this compromise proposal.

507
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,591
I asked for it to be second so we can move on.

508
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:11,052
Second, Mr. President.

509
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:14,914
Motion to table ends all debate.

510
00:38:15,114 --> 00:38:21,097
I was going to say, so the motion to table was offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by

511
00:38:21,976 --> 00:38:22,616
Second, Mr. President.

512
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:26,139
Point of information, isn't this table because it's out of order?

513
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:28,080
Automatically.

514
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,180
So this is out of order.

515
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,762
This is gonna go onto the agenda for next week, okay?

516
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:34,584
Councilor Ioannoni.

517
00:38:34,684 --> 00:38:37,245
The chair never made a ruling on whether or not the paper was out of order.

518
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:42,228
The paper was introduced, a motion was made before there was a request to have the ruling made on the paper.

519
00:38:42,268 --> 00:38:43,229
The motion was the table.

520
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:46,871
Then we had a debate on that, then that debate on the table was seconded.

521
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:48,652
That ends all debate on the topic

522
00:38:50,519 --> 00:39:00,165
The council wants to go through the exercise of having the paper ruled out of order, having maybe someone call the question of the chair and then going through that whole process again.

523
00:39:00,185 --> 00:39:02,606
I don't see where that's going to get us.

524
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:05,528
Ultimately, Mr. President, we're all on the same page here.

525
00:39:05,548 --> 00:39:08,210
We're all going down the same track here that I think we can agree on.

526
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,271
So let's not put any more obstacles in front of the way and let's get there.

527
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:20,707
Did you say something?

528
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:22,669
No, okay, I'm sorry.

529
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:28,172
On the motion of Council and I to table the seconded by Vice President Caviello, Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll.

530
00:39:33,715 --> 00:39:34,536
Councilor Behrs.

531
00:39:35,236 --> 00:39:35,957
Abstain.

532
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:41,240
Call the rolls, Mr. President.

533
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,382
I think you have to vote either way, Councilor Behrs.

534
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:44,822
Then no.

535
00:39:49,112 --> 00:39:50,153
So that's no to table.

536
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:52,595
I don't, I don't feel comfortable voting.

537
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:56,940
Vice-president Carabiello.

538
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,400
Yes.

539
00:39:59,702 --> 00:40:00,203
Councilor Knight.

540
00:40:00,663 --> 00:40:00,964
Yes.

541
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:02,905
Councilor Marks.

542
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:03,606
Yes.

543
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:06,049
Councilor Morrell.

544
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:06,769
Yes.

545
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,493
Councilor Scarpelli.

546
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:11,154
Yes.

547
00:40:12,775 --> 00:40:13,416
President Falco.

548
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:16,747
Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

549
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:18,669
The paper is tabled.

550
00:40:20,971 --> 00:40:23,132
It's tabled.

551
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,935
Motion to take back the public participation out of order.

552
00:40:28,297 --> 00:40:31,759
Mr. President, I have a question.

553
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,164
When Councilor Knight moved to suspend, he also moved to take 459 under suspension.

554
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:44,950
which is that's offered by Councilor Marks.

555
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,311
Can we table this one to next week as well, Councilor Marks?

556
00:40:47,972 --> 00:40:53,714
Mr. President, I would respectfully ask that this be combined with the other paper.

557
00:40:54,094 --> 00:41:00,516
They're of similar subject matter, and I feel to do that at the beginning and ask that this be combined to the other paper.

558
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:04,498
On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight,

559
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:09,824
to combine this with 20-461.

560
00:41:09,924 --> 00:41:18,031
Mr. President, just for the interest of transparency, if you wanna read it, so people know what the resolution was.

561
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:28,780
Be it resolved in the interest of moving forward, a plan be discussed to address ways to increase community participation during the Memphis City Council fiscal year 21 budget meetings.

562
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:30,228
Thank you, Mr. President.

563
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:41,339
Mr. President, I know Councilor Beers has made a motion for public participation, but there's a- Let's finish this motion first, if I may, okay?

564
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:44,822
The motion is to join this paper with the one that was previously tabled.

565
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:48,486
So I have a motion to join these papers, seconded by Councilor Knight.

566
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:50,048
Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

567
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:51,229
Councilor Beers.

568
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:51,829
Yes.

569
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:53,654
Vice President carabiello.

570
00:41:53,874 --> 00:41:54,976
Yes, Council night.

571
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:56,539
Yes, Council marks.

572
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,543
Yes, that's a morale.

573
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:00,427
Yes, that's a scarpelli.

574
00:42:00,787 --> 00:42:00,988
Yes.

575
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,019
Yes, I have an affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

576
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:05,820
Mr. President.

577
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,220
Vice President Carvio.

578
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:24,908
I understand that Councilor Beers wants to bring the public participation in, and I don't have any problem with that, but we do have Alicia Nunley-Benjamin for a paper from the mayor, if we could do that first, and then you can do whatever you wanna do, because I'm gonna sit here and read 30 emails.

579
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,789
This woman will be up all night.

580
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:28,310
I'm fine with that.

581
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:28,850
Okay.

582
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:32,941
So on the motion of Vice President Caviello to take a- 20449.

583
00:42:34,402 --> 00:42:40,726
20449, actually, so, Clerk Curtis, we're still under suspension.

584
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:42,587
We're still under suspension.

585
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:43,387
Okay, thank you.

586
00:42:43,808 --> 00:42:49,811
On the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Beard to take communications from the Mayor, 20-449.

587
00:42:53,286 --> 00:42:57,049
to the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis, Massachusetts 02155.

588
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:08,998
Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the appropriation of retained earnings in the amount of $1,500,000.00.

589
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:21,347
This amount is being requested to subsidize the fiscal 2021 Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund budget due to the health pandemic and current economic conditions.

590
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:25,211
retained earnings and reserves of the Water and Sewer Fund.

591
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:38,463
Reserves can be used for any lawful purpose, but serve primarily to provide financial security in cases of unforeseen events such as COVID-19 or capital replacement.

592
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,766
The balance of retained earnings before this vote is $6,433,552.

593
00:43:46,847 --> 00:43:46,987
Council.

594
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:47,187
Thank you.

595
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:47,387
Thank you.

596
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:47,667
Thank you.

597
00:43:47,687 --> 00:43:47,867
Thank you.

598
00:43:47,887 --> 00:43:48,147
Thank you.

599
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:48,348
Thank you.

600
00:43:48,368 --> 00:43:48,708
Thank you.

601
00:43:48,728 --> 00:43:48,988
Thank you.

602
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:49,208
Thank you.

603
00:43:49,228 --> 00:43:49,468
Thank you.

604
00:43:49,488 --> 00:43:49,748
Thank you.

605
00:43:49,768 --> 00:43:50,088
Thank you.

606
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:50,348
Thank you.

607
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:50,628
Thank you.

608
00:43:50,688 --> 00:43:51,009
Thank you.

609
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:51,229
Thank you.

610
00:43:51,249 --> 00:43:51,509
Thank you.

611
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:51,929
Thank you.

612
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:52,269
Thank you.

613
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:53,649
Thank you.

614
00:43:53,669 --> 00:43:53,890
Thank you.

615
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:54,090
Thank you.

616
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,330
Thank you.

617
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:54,530
Thank you.

618
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,730
Thank you.

619
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:54,950
Thank you.

620
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:55,270
Thank you.

621
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:55,530
Thank you.

622
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:56,711
Thank you.

623
00:43:56,731 --> 00:43:56,931
Thank you.

624
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:57,211
Thank you.

625
00:43:57,231 --> 00:43:58,171
Thank you.

626
00:43:58,191 --> 00:44:01,132
Thank you.

627
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:01,352
Thank you.

628
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:01,592
Thank you.

629
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:02,833
Thank you.

630
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:03,033
Thank you.

631
00:44:03,053 --> 00:44:03,313
Thank you.

632
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:03,653
Thank you.

633
00:44:03,693 --> 00:44:03,893
Thank you.

634
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:04,613
Thank you.

635
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:04,833
Thank you.

636
00:44:04,873 --> 00:44:05,094
Thank you.

637
00:44:05,134 --> 00:44:05,314
Thank you.

638
00:44:05,334 --> 00:44:05,514
Thank you.

639
00:44:05,534 --> 00:44:05,754
Thank you.

640
00:44:05,774 --> 00:44:06,034
Thank you.

641
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:06,494
Thank you.

642
00:44:06,534 --> 00:44:06,814
Thank you.

643
00:44:06,834 --> 00:44:07,134
Thank you.

644
00:44:07,154 --> 00:44:07,474
Thank you.

645
00:44:07,514 --> 00:44:07,715
Thank you.

646
00:44:07,735 --> 00:44:07,975
Thank you.

647
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:08,295
Thank you.

648
00:44:08,335 --> 00:44:08,595
Thank you.

649
00:44:08,635 --> 00:44:09,015
Thank you.

650
00:44:09,035 --> 00:44:09,255
Thank you.

651
00:44:09,295 --> 00:44:09,515
Thank you.

652
00:44:09,555 --> 00:44:09,755
Thank you.

653
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:10,395
Thank you.

654
00:44:10,455 --> 00:44:10,696
Thank you.

655
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:10,956
Thank you.

656
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:11,196
Thank you.

657
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:11,416
Thank you.

658
00:44:11,436 --> 00:44:11,616
Thank you.

659
00:44:11,636 --> 00:44:11,916
Thank you.

660
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:12,196
Thank you.

661
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:12,516
Thank you.

662
00:44:12,556 --> 00:44:12,856
Thank you.

663
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:13,196
Thank you.

664
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:13,477
Thank you.

665
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:13,877
Thank you.

666
00:44:13,897 --> 00:44:14,157
Thank you.

667
00:44:14,177 --> 00:44:14,477
Thank you.

668
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:28,501
recall your honorable body voted to reprogram $850,000 in capital outlay, which was in the sewer and water budget to a capital project fund, the leak detection fund that wasn't being utilized.

669
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:33,545
And this will be to subsidize as of for the budget that's coming forward.

670
00:44:36,487 --> 00:44:37,847
Any questions from the council?

671
00:44:38,288 --> 00:44:41,450
Council appears.

672
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,186
Thank you, Mr. President.

673
00:44:43,466 --> 00:44:49,167
Alicia, is there any concern that this will, you know, are we gonna have enough retained earnings going forward if we have any issues?

674
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:52,068
Yes, we will.

675
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:54,849
I think this is a proper use of retained earnings.

676
00:44:54,889 --> 00:45:05,691
What we're trying to do is, we know costs are going up, we know consumption's going down, and we're just trying to minimize the impact on the rate users during this horrible time of economic decline.

677
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:06,831
Thank you so much.

678
00:45:06,851 --> 00:45:11,472
Thank you, Councilor Peers.

679
00:45:11,512 --> 00:45:11,992
Councilor Knight?

680
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:13,895
Ms.

681
00:45:13,915 --> 00:45:20,097
Dunley-Benjamin, are you aware when the next set of rates are going to be established by the Water Sewer Commission?

682
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,197
They voted the rates.

683
00:45:23,378 --> 00:45:23,838
Okay.

684
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,219
And do you know what they are offhand?

685
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:38,762
Not offhand but I know it's a three percent increase overall which is about six dollars and some change to the average residential user.

686
00:45:38,782 --> 00:45:39,682
Okay.

687
00:45:40,857 --> 00:45:53,585
And this appropriation is going to be used to offset some of that impact to the residential user by keeping it at the balanced rate and using the reserves to offset it so that we don't have to have a further increase.

688
00:45:54,225 --> 00:45:54,986
Correct.

689
00:45:55,226 --> 00:45:55,846
Thank you very much.

690
00:45:55,906 --> 00:45:57,687
I support the paper and move approval, Mr. President.

691
00:45:58,388 --> 00:45:59,248
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

692
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:01,690
We have Councilor Morrell.

693
00:46:03,953 --> 00:46:05,054
Thank you, Mr. President.

694
00:46:05,334 --> 00:46:12,860
Director Nunley, so I know we've talked in previous meetings just about amounts or ratios for things like free cash that's preferred to have in the account.

695
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:18,044
Does something like this exist in this type of account that's a recommended amount or ratio?

696
00:46:18,064 --> 00:46:23,528
I know you said you feel comfortable with this amount, but I don't know if there's anything else.

697
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:25,670
Yes, but we make decisions based on the needs.

698
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,812
And because COVID-19, which is unprecedented, happened,

699
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:33,438
This is a good use of the funds to kind of prevent a huge rate increase.

700
00:46:33,638 --> 00:46:38,062
So we looked at it that way and we wanna minimize as much as we can.

701
00:46:38,502 --> 00:46:50,251
We still wanna keep our surplus reserves that we do have in case we need to do capital outlay or something happens, but there's sustainable amount of reserves there that we believe for right now, that's fine to take the 1.5 million.

702
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:54,895
On a percentage basis, I usually like to go anywhere between

703
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:57,887
5 to 10% is what I like to look at.

704
00:46:58,928 --> 00:47:01,230
But it's okay to go below that in cases of need.

705
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,212
And this is definitely one of those scenarios with the economic crisis.

706
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,014
Okay, thank you.

707
00:47:06,914 --> 00:47:07,915
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

708
00:47:08,335 --> 00:47:10,917
Councilor Marks, did I hear you?

709
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:11,978
Yes, yes.

710
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:14,640
I'm sitting on a low chair today, so.

711
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:25,124
Mr. President, if we could have direct, not only just, maybe I missed it, what the balance is in the account after the 1.5 million is used?

712
00:47:25,144 --> 00:47:29,125
Yeah, right now we have 6,000,433,552, and then we're gonna take out 1.5 million, so you'll have left in there 4,000,933,552.

713
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:54,159
The reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, and this may be a discussion we can have during budget debates, is that the mayor already committed, I believe it was a little over $5 million in free cash towards offsetting our deficit here in the community.

714
00:47:54,819 --> 00:48:03,547
And I would respectfully request that in addition to the $5 million, that we also look at the water and sewer enterprise account.

715
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:13,955
And I realize under state statute, it only allows us to use that money for certain purposes, and one being to offset a budget deficit.

716
00:48:14,736 --> 00:48:24,525
And in the past, I've been on the council for a number of years, we have dipped into that money to use to offset our snow and ice account in the city budget.

717
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:39,718
The reason why I state this, Mr. President, is it's very likely, even with the free cash, that there still is going to be some layoffs, in particular in the school side and some within police and fire and DPW, Mr. President.

718
00:48:40,238 --> 00:49:08,659
And I would ask that, respectfully, the city administration look at filing a home rule petition to tap into some of the additional 4 million plus that Director Nunley just mentioned that possibly is available that will keep us still maintaining the money for infrastructure and other emergency purposes, but also making sure, Mr. President, that we as a community don't have to experience the loss of teachers, guidance counselors, police, fire,

719
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,260
and other essential services within our community.

720
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:20,326
So I would just offer that as a B paper, Mr. President, that the city administration explore the option of filing a home rule petition.

721
00:49:20,546 --> 00:49:21,306
Thank you, Mr. President.

722
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,651
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

723
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:26,713
Clerk Hernandez is waving his hand here.

724
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:28,614
Everything okay, Clerk Hernandez?

725
00:49:28,934 --> 00:49:32,417
Councilor Marks answered my question before I was able to ask it.

726
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:36,300
I was wondering if he was filing an amendment and he said he was filing a B paper.

727
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,681
That is a B paper, you are correct.

728
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:39,042
Second, the B paper.

729
00:49:39,423 --> 00:49:44,367
On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded on the B paper, seconded by Councilor Behrs, Vice President Carvillo.

730
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:46,248
Thank you Mr. President.

731
00:49:47,369 --> 00:50:00,737
I had the opportunity to speak with some members of the Water and Soil Commission and they explained the situation why this money is being appropriated and I applaud their decision to take the residents of Medford

732
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:06,178
into consideration with the water rates at only 3%.

733
00:50:06,998 --> 00:50:11,819
I think they were saying that without this, the rate increase would have been substantially higher.

734
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:15,020
So again, this is something we've done in the past for many years.

735
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,841
We've done our best to keep the costs down for the residents.

736
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:30,363
But I think people seem to forget that we get a total bill from the MWRA every year, and we have to sell water.

737
00:50:31,283 --> 00:50:42,386
And unfortunately this year, with the COVID and the business shutdown, the commercial use, which pays the higher rate, dropped considerably.

738
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:47,427
And again, this was a big problem, I know, for the commission this year.

739
00:50:47,747 --> 00:50:56,129
So again, I applaud them for doing this and making sure that the residents pay the least amount of increase that's possible.

740
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,970
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

741
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:02,791
Any other comments for the councilors on this?

742
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:04,093
Oh, Councilor Scarpelli.

743
00:51:04,987 --> 00:51:24,817
Again, thank you, just to reiterate what Councilor Caviello said, I know the commission works very hard and they keep all of our citizens as a first priority and with the budget and financial impacts to each community member being negatively affected, keeping that at 3% is a blessing.

744
00:51:24,837 --> 00:51:31,080
So thank you so much to them and well done with this paper, so thank you.

745
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:33,657
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

746
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:37,998
Any other questions from the council regarding this particular paper?

747
00:51:41,279 --> 00:51:42,019
I don't see any.

748
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:48,000
So do we have any questions from the public about this paper here, this particular paper?

749
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,921
Clerk Carnavis, you see anything?

750
00:51:55,981 --> 00:51:57,742
Mr. President, I don't see anything on this particular paper.

751
00:51:58,322 --> 00:51:59,622
Okay, thank you.

752
00:52:02,908 --> 00:52:04,128
So we'll take the B paper first.

753
00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:08,170
There's a B paper that is offered by Councilor Marks and seconded by Councilor Behrs.

754
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,951
Clerk Artemis, do you have the language to the B paper?

755
00:52:14,072 --> 00:52:15,393
You're muted, Councilor.

756
00:52:15,553 --> 00:52:16,113
Sorry.

757
00:52:16,853 --> 00:52:17,093
Clerk.

758
00:52:17,613 --> 00:52:30,538
Councilor Marks' B paper was to look at the water and sewer enterprise account and for the administration to look into filing a home rule petition to explore additional funding options.

759
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:35,865
Is that correct, counselor?

760
00:52:36,225 --> 00:52:37,245
If I could just clarify.

761
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:47,688
To look at the Water and Sewer Enterprise account and file a home rule petition and potentially offset any budget deficits that we may have with the Water and Sewer Enterprise account.

762
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:53,509
The remaining, I believe, was $400, $4 million and somewhat change that Director Nunley mentioned.

763
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:54,109
OK.

764
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:54,929
Thank you.

765
00:52:55,529 --> 00:52:55,869
Thanks.

766
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:01,711
I have a motion offered by Councilor Marks and seconded by Councilor Beers.

767
00:53:01,751 --> 00:53:02,771
This is the B paper.

768
00:53:03,753 --> 00:53:05,013
Clerk, please call the roll.

769
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:08,114
Councilor Behrs?

770
00:53:08,675 --> 00:53:08,895
Yes.

771
00:53:09,355 --> 00:53:10,255
Vice President Caravaglia?

772
00:53:10,435 --> 00:53:10,695
Yes.

773
00:53:11,336 --> 00:53:11,856
Councilor Knight?

774
00:53:12,196 --> 00:53:12,456
Yes.

775
00:53:12,936 --> 00:53:13,516
Councilor Marks?

776
00:53:14,176 --> 00:53:14,437
Yes.

777
00:53:15,557 --> 00:53:16,257
Councilor Morrell?

778
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:16,977
Yes.

779
00:53:17,478 --> 00:53:18,278
Councilor Scarpelli?

780
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:19,078
Yes.

781
00:53:19,438 --> 00:53:22,539
President Falco?

782
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:23,400
Yes.

783
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,200
Senate affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

Yes.

821
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:43,726
Councilor Morrell.

822
00:54:44,287 --> 00:54:44,527
Yes.

823
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:47,610
President Falco.

824
00:54:48,311 --> 00:54:48,571
Yes.

825
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:50,493
Councilor Kelly.

00:54:51,013 --> 00:54:51,273
Yes.

827
00:54:52,815 --> 00:54:53,275
Okay, thank you.

828
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:55,477
Apologies, we're going out of order.

829
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:05,473
the motion passes and now we are ready for public participation.

830
00:55:08,136 --> 00:55:12,479
At this time what I will do is if you put your hand up I will call on you.

831
00:55:16,082 --> 00:55:20,926
This is where I have a tough time managing the zoom but I will try to call on everybody that I see that has their hand up.

832
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:23,088
Be patient please.

833
00:55:25,975 --> 00:55:26,515
Mr. President?

834
00:55:27,016 --> 00:55:27,836
Yes, Council Member.

835
00:55:28,096 --> 00:55:30,818
Are you looking for physical hands, hands in the Zoom, either or?

836
00:55:31,438 --> 00:55:33,119
I guess either or.

837
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:41,284
If you can use the Zoom hands, that's great because it's easy to find, but if you can't and you're not sure, just give me a wave and I'll find you.

838
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:45,547
If I may, I know over the past week there have been

839
00:55:47,141 --> 00:55:49,202
There's been a lot of talk about the budget and whatnot.

840
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:51,484
I know a lot of people want to speak on that issue.

841
00:55:51,884 --> 00:55:56,268
The only thing that I ask is please be professional and courteous.

842
00:55:57,669 --> 00:55:58,649
That's all I ask.

843
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:04,033
And when you're called, if you could please give your name and address for the record.

844
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:06,115
That's part of the process.

845
00:56:06,135 --> 00:56:07,516
So let's see.

846
00:56:16,027 --> 00:56:17,547
We can please have your name and address for the record.

847
00:56:18,988 --> 00:56:22,629
Hi, I'm Laura Deruder and I'm from 190 High Street.

848
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:27,291
Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to say something.

849
00:56:30,272 --> 00:56:34,733
First of all, I want to say that I'm happy to hear that all the councillors agree that Zoom is important.

850
00:56:35,894 --> 00:56:45,559
You've seen how many people have shown up here how many people or maybe you've heard of those who weren't there How many people showed up for the budget meeting?

851
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,561
And and I have two points.

852
00:56:47,601 --> 00:57:03,149
The first one is I don't understand why The counselors weren't there didn't feel that they could show up and explain why they think that this forum was inappropriate There was no information for anyone in which said that you wouldn't

853
00:57:03,468 --> 00:57:07,310
participate, that's how we understood it when it was presented at the meeting.

854
00:57:08,911 --> 00:57:15,035
And similarly, now that you were mentioning issues, concerns, but you're keeping things very vague.

855
00:57:15,295 --> 00:57:24,540
And I think it would be really good to know what you're referring to, what those concerns are, to spell it out so that the public can understand what your points are.

856
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:34,219
The second point that I want to make is actually a recommendation or a concern that I have if you now start having hybrid meetings.

857
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:41,328
So if you, let's say you are meeting in person, because it's inside, you would still have to wear masks.

858
00:57:41,977 --> 00:57:47,802
it would be really hard to understand that unless you have a microphone right next to your mouth.

859
00:57:47,982 --> 00:57:59,451
So for people who are then not in the room and for people who are joining via Zoom, they will have a hard time understanding, especially people who are hearing impaired who need to see the mouth to understand what people are saying.

860
00:58:00,052 --> 00:58:09,099
And from my own experience of having hybrid meetings in a large organization, even before there were masks, it's very easy to

861
00:58:09,662 --> 00:58:11,944
ignore and sideline the people who are not in the room.

862
00:58:13,445 --> 00:58:20,530
So my appeal to the council is to keep the meetings Zoom based.

863
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:29,816
If you want to solicit feedback from people, as you said, people are very happy to send emails to you and to the clerk.

864
00:58:29,856 --> 00:58:32,178
So that is still an opportunity to do that.

865
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,459
So all I want to say is,

866
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:40,824
Please keep the meetings and I caution about a use of hybrid meetings because it's really also an accessibility issue.

867
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:41,424
Thank you.

868
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:42,385
Thank you.

869
00:58:42,405 --> 00:58:43,826
You bring up a lot of good points.

870
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:45,247
Thank you for those comments.

871
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:47,508
Let's see here.

872
00:58:51,131 --> 00:58:52,532
Please have your name and address for the record.

873
00:58:53,052 --> 00:58:54,413
Hi, my name is Rachel Wolk.

874
00:58:54,513 --> 00:58:55,513
I'm at 582 Fulton Street.

875
00:58:58,078 --> 00:59:01,821
I just wanted to bring up sort of something that was a point of confusion for me.

876
00:59:01,961 --> 00:59:14,350
I think nearly all four of the counselors who were not in attendance at the budget meeting made some type of comment tonight about how this type of turnout is unprecedented, both for a budget meeting and for a city council meeting.

877
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:18,373
So that we're seeing more than we ever did pre-pandemic.

878
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:22,296
And then in the next breath, you also said that it's an accessibility issue.

879
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,418
So to me, those two things sort of seem

880
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:28,039
I think it is important to recognize that both can't exist at the same time.

881
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:40,303
And as a constituent, how it makes me feel to see both of those things is that you are seeing constituents show up, just not the ones that you want.

882
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:46,965
It sort of feels like the access is here, the people are showing up, but it is not the ones who agree with you.

883
00:59:47,246 --> 00:59:49,346
And that doesn't feel very good as a constituent.

884
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,560
Thank you, Ms.

885
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:59,142
Donahue, I appreciate your comment, but again... Ms.

886
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,043
Wolk, is it Wolk?

887
01:00:01,183 --> 01:00:01,523
I'm sorry.

888
01:00:01,623 --> 01:00:02,024
I'm sorry.

889
01:00:02,504 --> 01:00:04,225
I see Donahue, I apologize.

890
01:00:04,565 --> 01:00:22,274
But just for clarification for myself, I think that the understanding that we had calls and emails about having the ability to try to do something in person, because we do have, even if it's one person,

891
01:00:23,034 --> 01:00:24,015
even if it's one person.

892
01:00:24,456 --> 01:00:25,197
This is great.

893
01:00:25,737 --> 01:00:40,735
Believe us, we love the idea that we have 246 people on Zoom, but if there's one person that can't access this that wants to be there in person and we can find a way to do both, why is that a concern?

894
01:00:40,775 --> 01:00:41,656
Why is that an issue?

895
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:50,581
I work in health care, so the issue to me is that I'm concerned we're going to cause another outbreak in our community.

896
01:00:50,741 --> 01:00:55,823
As far as access goes, it's my understanding that you only need access to a telephone to attend this meeting.

897
01:00:55,843 --> 01:00:58,504
You don't need to download Zoom, you don't need a computer.

898
01:00:58,844 --> 01:01:01,065
So who in our community can't dial a telephone?

899
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:02,545
It's insulting to seniors.

900
01:01:02,585 --> 01:01:03,966
So if there is one person

901
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:24,266
that has contacted us, that feels that they have been constrained because of this, and they feel that being somewhere in person, that they make that choice to be there, using the social distancing format, using that in place for us.

902
01:01:24,866 --> 01:01:27,327
Do you think, is that a problem?

903
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:28,588
I don't see that as a problem.

904
01:01:28,848 --> 01:01:35,130
I'm just- You have 200 people here tonight who are saying that an in-person meeting would reduce our access, but you don't care about those people.

905
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:35,770
Absolutely not.

906
01:01:36,331 --> 01:01:39,072
I never said to limit that access.

907
01:01:39,772 --> 01:01:46,900
I can't tell you that our access would be limited if it was offered in person or as a hybrid.

908
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,004
Mr. President, if I can, I don't know what the confusion is.

909
01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:59,294
I think and I support having a Zoom meeting that we're having as part of our deliberation, but adding the piece that those people that

910
01:02:00,015 --> 01:02:10,983
that don't want to do it this way, that have the ability, that want to come to a format in person with the council, with the finance team, in a safe format.

911
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:12,976
Why is that an issue?

912
01:02:13,016 --> 01:02:15,917
Because the Department of Public Health has said it is not safe.

913
01:02:15,977 --> 01:02:17,658
It's you who is saying that it is safe.

914
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:19,118
No, I'm going to disagree with you.

915
01:02:19,258 --> 01:02:23,379
I think that we have shown precedence in our community over the past few weeks.

916
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:29,861
When we need to stand up when seeing injustice and we need to talk about issues, then we do that as a community.

917
01:02:30,221 --> 01:02:30,821
And we did that.

918
01:02:34,722 --> 01:02:35,863
and he doesn't think it's a good idea.

919
01:02:35,883 --> 01:02:37,543
Point of information, Mr. President.

920
01:02:37,923 --> 01:02:39,804
Point of information, Councilor Caviello.

921
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:40,464
Thank you.

922
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:47,487
Mr. President, if anybody could make their comments through the chair, otherwise we're going to have a shouting match going on all night long.

923
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:50,169
Okay, Ms.

924
01:02:50,189 --> 01:02:52,610
Wolk, I'm sorry, do you have any further comments you'd like to make?

925
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:58,112
That's it, but I'm pretty disappointed in all four of these councilors, and you've really lost my faith.

926
01:02:59,512 --> 01:02:59,873
Thank you.

927
01:03:00,873 --> 01:03:02,914
Let's see, we have Susan Bivens.

928
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:09,647
If you could please have your name and address for the record.

929
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:11,548
Hi, my name is Susan Bibbins.

930
01:03:11,968 --> 01:03:14,529
I'm at 77 Stanley Ave.

931
01:03:16,629 --> 01:03:28,513
And I would like to agree with somebody who said before that masks are an accessibility issue.

932
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:34,817
I'm hoping that you'll all be wearing masks if you meet in person.

933
01:03:34,837 --> 01:03:43,259
Furthermore, I'd like to add that meetings of 10 people and above are still ill-advised.

934
01:03:44,759 --> 01:03:56,603
So how can you put forth a meeting of 10 people or more if it's still ill-advised or prohibited by

935
01:03:57,445 --> 01:04:02,510
the health department, I'd like to ask, and I'd like to know.

936
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:19,027
And as a member of the community who's disabled, I'd like to say that having meetings in the chamber is something of an accessibility

937
01:04:20,571 --> 01:04:28,718
issue because we don't get to see the public participation because the back is turned.

938
01:04:29,718 --> 01:04:35,263
And Zoom is much more accessible, I feel.

939
01:04:37,985 --> 01:04:40,687
So, thank you for letting me speak.

940
01:04:41,428 --> 01:04:42,128
Thank you very much.

941
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:47,833
Okay, let's see, we have Kelly Catello.

942
01:04:49,128 --> 01:04:50,671
If you could please have your name and address.

943
01:04:52,816 --> 01:04:54,199
Name and address for the record, please.

944
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:57,259
Kelly Catalo, 46 Otis Street in Medford.

945
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:01,100
I think that this can really be accomplished.

946
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,720
I negotiate for a living.

947
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,001
It is extremely hard.

948
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,882
People have, they communicate very different ways.

949
01:05:08,342 --> 01:05:11,363
Your council has always negotiated in person.

950
01:05:11,803 --> 01:05:16,484
We have a budget that there's a lot of people that are gonna get laid off.

951
01:05:16,904 --> 01:05:19,245
There's a lot of money that is not there.

952
01:05:20,225 --> 01:05:32,412
If you're in person, you're going to be able to get through it and hopefully understand each other's opinions to the point where everybody feels like every department has been served and that it's equal.

953
01:05:33,392 --> 01:05:38,115
I don't think that I was part of a couple of hybrid meetings in the last couple of weeks.

954
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:40,877
And it wasn't difficult at all.

955
01:05:40,897 --> 01:06:00,173
Um, yes, there was people in the same room that had a mask on the microphones were wired to the mask it can happen Um, we live in 2020 anything can happen right now I don't think that the people the public should feel like they're not going to be a part of it Because it's just like you are right now here on zoom.

956
01:06:00,573 --> 01:06:06,678
You are a part of the public meeting um, nobody, I don't think that any of these people are trying to

957
01:06:07,258 --> 01:06:09,320
negate that or take people out.

958
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,581
They're just trying to have more options.

959
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:18,205
And as somebody that had a sit through that Zoom meeting of that school committee last week, I want meetings in person.

960
01:06:18,486 --> 01:06:22,028
I want to be able to speak up in person.

961
01:06:22,748 --> 01:06:29,033
There's some city counselors that are sitting here saying that it's not safe, but they thought it was safe to go to a protest.

962
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:32,415
And there was pictures taken of that counselor without a mask on.

963
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:34,355
I don't want to argue.

964
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:36,356
I want to see happy Medford again.

965
01:06:36,756 --> 01:06:42,217
But I think if everybody works together, this can happen so that you're all comfortable.

966
01:06:42,637 --> 01:06:44,538
The public feels that they can be a part of it.

967
01:06:44,938 --> 01:06:52,120
And one more thing I'd like to bring up while I'm speaking, Mr. Falco, signs are not allowed inside the council chambers.

968
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:56,561
And I'm finding it very distracting that there's signs all over the screen here.

969
01:06:56,621 --> 01:06:58,221
So I don't know what the rule is on that.

970
01:06:58,361 --> 01:06:58,801
Thank you.

971
01:06:59,461 --> 01:06:59,761
Thank you.

972
01:07:04,349 --> 01:07:06,350
Sean Began, name and address for the record, please.

973
01:07:09,452 --> 01:07:10,433
Yes, thank you.

974
01:07:10,513 --> 01:07:14,876
Sean Began, 362 Lawrence Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

975
01:07:15,096 --> 01:07:19,780
I also have an office at Zero Governors Ave, Medford, Massachusetts.

976
01:07:22,241 --> 01:07:26,585
So I've been thinking about this issue for the past three days because

977
01:07:27,604 --> 01:07:29,545
Frankly, it's been a little bit slow in my office.

978
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:35,348
So I've had a little while to make some notes and jot down some opinions.

979
01:07:35,408 --> 01:07:40,171
And this is what I'd like to say on the topic of in-person meetings.

980
01:07:42,952 --> 01:07:49,035
The distance and the comfort of a counselor's home is not where issues of importance should be debated.

981
01:07:50,116 --> 01:07:55,279
When there are differing opinions that involve issues regarding the health and safety of the residents of Medford,

982
01:07:55,994 --> 01:08:08,881
and I fully expect that there will be differing opinions on certain budget items, then the relative safety provided by one's laptop computer will not be conducive to reaching an accord or understanding on these issues.

983
01:08:09,782 --> 01:08:16,286
Nor does it provide a positive environment for actual and focused listening to an opposing point of view.

984
01:08:17,947 --> 01:08:21,228
But maybe that is what some politicians prefer these days.

985
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:25,431
It seems to me that recently sowing discord and division

986
01:08:26,386 --> 01:08:30,087
is preferred over decorum and spirited debate of the issues.

987
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:50,292
Over the past few months, I've witnessed our elected officials on city council and school committee make declarations like kings and queens from the virtual safety of their bedrooms, issuing edicts, declaring a discussion over before it started, and generally pulling stunts that are too brazen to be attempted in person.

988
01:08:51,372 --> 01:08:58,395
It is all in keeping with the toxic social media environment that seems to encourage rude, obnoxious, and bullying behavior.

989
01:08:59,456 --> 01:09:01,997
This is not the way to discuss serious issues.

990
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:17,965
As this city is well on its way to reopening, it is time for elected officials to be meeting in person once again, and to have those face-to-face discussions with all of the uncomfortable moments that face-to-face meetings involve when serious issues are debated.

991
01:09:19,202 --> 01:09:28,249
The counselors need to be able to look at each other and at the department heads in the eye and judge the other's credibility and integrity on the issues.

992
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:39,937
The public needs to be able to see their counselors have those uncomfortable moments that only come from a face-to-face conversation, even if the public is watching remotely.

993
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:47,943
In turn, the public will make their own determination as to the credibility and integrity of their elected officials and department heads.

994
01:09:49,057 --> 01:09:58,324
I trust that the council will have this matter resolved by the time that the next meeting agenda is issued by the clerk and that the grandstanding on all sides will come to an immediate end.

995
01:09:59,365 --> 01:10:01,727
It is in the best interest of the city that this happens.

996
01:10:02,788 --> 01:10:07,552
Social distancing, technology and critical thinking can be combined to reach a solution.

997
01:10:08,593 --> 01:10:12,556
I'm confident that the city hall will work with this council to facilitate a resolution.

998
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:19,044
During your discussions, please keep in mind that a settlement means that no one is entirely happy with the outcome.

999
01:10:19,705 --> 01:10:21,967
As always, both sides must give a little.

1000
01:10:22,587 --> 01:10:22,968
Thank you.

1001
01:10:23,668 --> 01:10:24,008
Thank you.

1002
01:10:24,068 --> 01:10:26,911
Point of information, Councilor Raul.

1003
01:10:27,271 --> 01:10:29,012
I'm actually in my office, not my bedroom.

1004
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:29,473
Thank you.

1005
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:31,554
Thank you, Councilor Raul.

1006
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:33,616
Let's see.

1007
01:10:36,118 --> 01:10:41,703
Martha Andres, if you could please have your name and address for the record.

1008
01:10:42,385 --> 01:10:44,266
Yes, my name is Martha Andrus.

1009
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:49,048
I live at 45 Kilgore Road in West Medford.

1010
01:10:50,309 --> 01:10:51,910
I am 71 years old.

1011
01:10:53,051 --> 01:10:59,134
I am very concerned about the high rate of COVID in Medford.

1012
01:11:00,835 --> 01:11:06,818
I am extremely grateful that we have a mayor and a public health director who are courageous enough

1013
01:11:07,576 --> 01:11:15,363
to try to balance the economic concerns and the health concerns and keep us safe.

1014
01:11:16,724 --> 01:11:22,069
I am very disappointed in counselors, and I've worked with them all.

1015
01:11:22,129 --> 01:11:33,899
I know they are well-intentioned people who go against what the public health director and the mayor have decided after looking at all sides of the issue.

1016
01:11:34,512 --> 01:11:35,892
I know you're meeting tomorrow.

1017
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:42,493
I'm glad to hear that the counselors will go along with what is decided.

1018
01:11:43,414 --> 01:11:46,254
This budget is tough, it's extremely tough.

1019
01:11:47,234 --> 01:11:48,594
It's hurting a lot of people.

1020
01:11:49,955 --> 01:11:51,755
That's somewhat inevitable.

1021
01:11:51,815 --> 01:11:54,875
We need leadership that shows up and does the job.

1022
01:11:55,055 --> 01:11:55,476
Thank you.

1023
01:11:56,116 --> 01:11:56,516
Thank you.

1024
01:11:58,036 --> 01:11:58,596
Let's see.

1025
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:03,797
Jennifer Sullivan, please have your name and address for the record.

1026
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:07,938
Sure, Jennifer Sullivan, Marston Street, Medford, born and raised.

1027
01:12:09,139 --> 01:12:10,740
Just a quick thing I wanted to mention.

1028
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:13,741
I work in online education since 2004.

1029
01:12:14,261 --> 01:12:16,082
I do about 10 Zoom calls a day.

1030
01:12:16,102 --> 01:12:20,525
And I've been using Zoom for four years, so I use it multiple times a day.

1031
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:31,251
And I just don't understand why it's good enough for everyone to educate their children and to get a college education, but it's not good enough for dialogue about

1032
01:12:32,011 --> 01:12:33,132
politics.

1033
01:12:33,633 --> 01:12:36,736
We grant master's degrees online.

1034
01:12:37,217 --> 01:12:40,400
So I disagree that this is not an adequate solution.

1035
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:49,569
And also on every meeting I've attended, I have private messaged various people offering all of my services for troubleshooting or sending you documents.

1036
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:52,191
So again, I put my hand out.

1037
01:12:52,331 --> 01:12:58,573
If there's particular people that are concerned about how to use Zoom, A, I just want to remind you, call in by a telephone.

1038
01:12:59,413 --> 01:13:09,677
B, I've held presentations with people on mountaintops and in war zones with, you know, maybe not perfect, but it definitely works.

1039
01:13:10,597 --> 01:13:12,098
Please feel free to reach out to me.

1040
01:13:12,318 --> 01:13:14,419
I will help people get more comfortable with Zoom.

1041
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:15,819
I think a lot of this is anxiety.

1042
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:16,680
Thank you.

1043
01:13:21,352 --> 01:13:27,433
Okay, we have Dennis.

1044
01:13:28,293 --> 01:13:29,734
Name and address for the record, please.

1045
01:13:32,754 --> 01:13:37,715
Hi, my name is Dennis Dettling-Kalto from 120 North Street in Medford.

1046
01:13:39,076 --> 01:13:41,756
And I don't want to get into the politics of this.

1047
01:13:41,856 --> 01:13:51,098
I understand that there's divisions, but what concerns me is the spending priorities of Medford are very important right now considering the shortfall.

1048
01:13:52,474 --> 01:14:06,600
And what my input is that I've seen that the mayor and other people are calling for funds for historical site restoration and things that are not essential services at this time.

1049
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:20,926
And before we put money into those kinds of things, I'd like to see that we, and doing layoffs and so on, we should try to cut those expenses for things that are not essential,

1050
01:14:21,912 --> 01:14:27,734
and do things that need to be done, like fixing potholes that are not being fixed in the city.

1051
01:14:31,135 --> 01:14:44,660
And I'd like these issues to be discussed about the actual, what the budget is going to be, and not go over, well, I said this, and he said that.

1052
01:14:45,834 --> 01:14:50,256
You know, I really didn't mean that and make a hybrid thing or not a hybrid thing.

1053
01:14:50,296 --> 01:15:07,022
Those technology things can be worked out, but if we don't meet and don't discuss these issues, and I mean the counselors, of course, and with input from the public, the budget's just going to fall apart.

1054
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:12,744
So I think it's important to discuss the budget itself and what the spending is going to be right now.

1055
01:15:14,925 --> 01:15:15,245
Thank you.

1056
01:15:17,036 --> 01:15:20,238
So we have, oh, I'm sorry, Alyssa.

1057
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,901
Hi, my name is Alyssa Lodato.

1058
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:26,963
I live at 74 Marion Street.

1059
01:15:30,605 --> 01:15:33,827
I think a lot of this discussion has gotten confused.

1060
01:15:34,248 --> 01:15:41,753
I think the thing about Zoom or how we're gonna show up for these meetings is a little bit lost in the fact that

1061
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:46,934
some of our representatives decided that they weren't going to show up.

1062
01:15:49,156 --> 01:15:53,180
And then just continued to do that with no messaging for the public.

1063
01:15:53,860 --> 01:16:03,449
And now that they have, it appears that they're unified in the idea that now that they're here and they're ready, we all need to come together.

1064
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,833
And I think that the fact that they think

1065
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:17,075
they don't have to respect the department of health or the president of the city council's discussion with those people or the mayor's decisions is troubling.

1066
01:16:17,095 --> 01:16:25,037
And it's not to me about Zoom, although I do think Zoom is a great thing for us to use.

1067
01:16:25,577 --> 01:16:27,597
And I do think more people have access than ever.

1068
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:36,599
I'm concerned that in that we're losing the timeline of people deciding not to show up and how they were gonna unify for that decision.

1069
01:16:37,576 --> 01:16:41,377
and make sure there wasn't a quorum of people that could go on with these meetings without them.

1070
01:16:42,137 --> 01:16:44,637
I think that that's very much not transparent.

1071
01:16:44,817 --> 01:16:45,677
It's underhanded.

1072
01:16:46,738 --> 01:16:55,679
And although I don't know what your intent is, um... Point of information, Mr. President.

1073
01:16:55,859 --> 01:16:58,040
Point of information, Councilor Caviello.

1074
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,420
I'm offended by that.

1075
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,900
There was nothing underhanded.

1076
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,161
I'm allowed to have my stand and my opinion.

1077
01:17:03,561 --> 01:17:05,181
So again, there was nothing underhanded here.

1078
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:12,595
Do you not then feel as if showing up to do your job is- I do my job every day for this city.

1079
01:17:13,016 --> 01:17:14,259
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1080
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:25,580
Well, you don't feel it's underhanded, but too much of the public, it feels as though you have neglected your job to serve us.

1081
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:33,626
Mr. President, if I'm going to sit here and be attacked and be called underhanded, I'm not going to stand for that, Mr. President.

1082
01:17:33,646 --> 01:17:34,706
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

1083
01:17:34,727 --> 01:17:43,753
If you could make everyone, if you could just, if you make comments through the chair, so if you could just direct the comments to the chair and like I said, just try to keep professional.

1084
01:17:44,074 --> 01:17:45,835
I understand it's a contentious issue.

1085
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,678
And we're trying to work towards a solution.

1086
01:17:48,738 --> 01:17:50,298
And I appreciate it.

1087
01:17:50,859 --> 01:17:54,500
It's great to see that there are 245 people that are interested in this.

1088
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,961
And I'm very happy to see everyone online.

1089
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,422
And I want to make sure we get to everyone.

1090
01:18:00,462 --> 01:18:02,022
So Alisa, I'm sorry.

1091
01:18:02,262 --> 01:18:02,863
Are you still here?

1092
01:18:03,383 --> 01:18:03,603
Yes.

1093
01:18:04,243 --> 01:18:04,983
Oh, you moved.

1094
01:18:05,523 --> 01:18:06,464
You moved on my screen.

1095
01:18:06,504 --> 01:18:07,064
I'm sorry.

1096
01:18:07,444 --> 01:18:08,004
No problem.

1097
01:18:08,745 --> 01:18:15,867
I just really think that we should defer to the people who are

1098
01:18:18,775 --> 01:18:42,424
Schooled and have worked very hard to get to the positions that they're at and know uh, what needs to be done they are paid to do what they do in their field in our government and that It seems everybody feels like they know more about medicine and epidemiology now because they can get their nails done and it's troubling and I think that

1099
01:18:43,325 --> 01:18:50,117
The discussion about whether or not certain officials have shown up for this is getting lost in all the rhetoric about Zoom.

1100
01:18:50,477 --> 01:18:53,683
I suppose that's really the crux of the issue.

1101
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:54,104
Thank you.

1102
01:18:55,326 --> 01:18:55,626
Thank you.

1103
01:18:57,184 --> 01:18:58,345
Point of information, Mr. President.

1104
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,106
Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1105
01:19:00,647 --> 01:19:01,848
So I believe it's Alicia.

1106
01:19:02,828 --> 01:19:03,809
I heard you speak.

1107
01:19:04,009 --> 01:19:04,550
I'm sorry, Alicia.

1108
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:06,011
I heard you speak, and I appreciate.

1109
01:19:06,551 --> 01:19:11,055
I know you spoke in the City School Committee meeting, and you're a very educated woman.

1110
01:19:11,095 --> 01:19:11,896
I believe you're a teacher.

1111
01:19:11,936 --> 01:19:25,226
And if you were in a situation where you have your classroom of 20 students, and 19 were getting what they wanted, but you had one student that showed an

1112
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:28,607
and intention that they weren't being heard.

1113
01:19:30,068 --> 01:19:31,489
How would you feel about that?

1114
01:19:31,569 --> 01:19:32,709
Would you be as a teacher?

1115
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:33,870
Would you fight?

1116
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,030
Because I heard you speak.

1117
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:38,552
Would you fight and do anything you can to make sure that student is heard?

1118
01:19:39,493 --> 01:19:39,753
Would you?

1119
01:19:41,096 --> 01:19:41,876
It's yes or no.

1120
01:19:42,137 --> 01:19:43,657
How I would ask you.

1121
01:19:44,378 --> 01:19:46,279
It's a really simple question, and I'll get to that.

1122
01:19:46,559 --> 01:19:50,421
I'll get to my, why the reasoning, but would you really fight for that person?

1123
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:54,443
I would fight, but I would start with a statement of intention.

1124
01:19:54,764 --> 01:19:57,525
My response would be, my intention is my intention.

1125
01:19:57,545 --> 01:20:03,488
It was my, I know we heard what you said, and Councilor Carviello already stated that, and you said you weren't doing it that way.

1126
01:20:03,749 --> 01:20:08,411
So I'm gonna take your word for it that it wasn't an action of intent insult.

1127
01:20:08,451 --> 01:20:09,292
But what I'm saying is,

1128
01:20:10,012 --> 01:20:21,156
We made decisions, at least I made decisions on my own, because like you said, for that one student, for that one representative of the community that voted for me or didn't vote for me, they want a voice.

1129
01:20:22,476 --> 01:20:28,478
Not to say that it's not in Zoom, because I think all of us believe that if you feel that you're unsafe, you should be in Zoom.

1130
01:20:28,838 --> 01:20:36,220
The question we had during this process is giving the voice to that one person that doesn't want or needs to be in that room.

1131
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:36,860
That's all.

1132
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:38,321
So I appreciate the comment.

1133
01:20:38,361 --> 01:20:38,641
Thank you.

1134
01:20:40,065 --> 01:20:55,059
I would like to say, though, that if your intention was to serve the community and any of you, not you specifically, then a statement about the purpose of your absence would have gone a long way.

1135
01:20:55,159 --> 01:21:04,307
What you did by not saying anything was encourage a bunch of citizens to decide for you what your messaging was

1136
01:21:04,951 --> 01:21:10,436
and what your intent was, and to argue amongst themselves in the absence of real information.

1137
01:21:11,077 --> 01:21:15,181
And as a teacher, I can tell you that would not have been my approach.

1138
01:21:16,602 --> 01:21:16,982
Thank you.

1139
01:21:18,724 --> 01:21:21,046
Let's see, we have Brock Walsh.

1140
01:21:21,086 --> 01:21:22,648
I believe you had your hand up.

1141
01:21:22,808 --> 01:21:25,150
Brock, if we could please have your name and address for the record.

1142
01:21:26,231 --> 01:21:27,532
Brock Walsh, 206 Salem Street.

1143
01:21:29,643 --> 01:21:35,026
President Falco, I just wanted to address to you your thanks for heeding the words of the director of departmental health O'Connor.

1144
01:21:36,086 --> 01:21:43,509
I was wondering if we could hear from the rest of the counselors why they felt that they didn't want to heed the expertise that was lent to the committee by our paid city officials.

1145
01:21:52,493 --> 01:21:54,254
Not sure if anyone wants to weigh in on that.

1146
01:21:56,392 --> 01:21:57,813
Well, that's very disappointing.

1147
01:21:58,113 --> 01:21:59,454
I believe Councilor Knight wants to speak.

1148
01:21:59,474 --> 01:21:59,935
Councilor Knight.

1149
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:02,156
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1150
01:22:02,276 --> 01:22:21,150
It's my understanding, based upon my most recent conversation with the Director of the Board of Health, that government bodies were deemed exempt from the 10-person gathering rule, which led me to believe that where we have a budget that's $184 million with a $10 million shortfall, if we were going to be discussing issues of that severity, that we should all be in the same room to address it.

1151
01:22:21,862 --> 01:22:30,645
Um, so when the council took a vote to say that we should all meet non-virtually to address these budget hearings The non-virtual piece was us being in the same room.

1152
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:32,146
The virtual component can be there.

1153
01:22:32,446 --> 01:22:51,512
That is what it is Um, you know, so ultimately my concern was this the council voted one way It was never brought back to the council to say that that can't happen and this is why Okay, so we had a meeting on tuesday night and on tuesday night we were talking about how you know We need to have these budget hearings in person and we need to schedule them in person

1154
01:22:52,508 --> 01:22:55,470
All the councils spoke on it, and everyone pretty much was in agreement.

1155
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:56,011
Yeah, you're right.

1156
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:57,272
We do need to meet in person.

1157
01:22:57,792 --> 01:23:00,854
Then the budget hearing schedule was published on Wednesday.

1158
01:23:02,115 --> 01:23:10,401
Ultimately, at the end of the day, you have four councillors here that are the four senior members of the council with over 100 years of combined experience in government that felt that something was wrong.

1159
01:23:12,142 --> 01:23:12,963
We felt something was wrong.

1160
01:23:13,043 --> 01:23:16,005
We felt something needed to be looked at a little further, so we took a stand.

1161
01:23:16,599 --> 01:23:16,859
All right?

1162
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:19,642
I acted as an individual when I said I'm not coming to this meeting.

1163
01:23:20,402 --> 01:23:24,385
Who knew what, when, and we could go on and on and go tit-for-tat with that.

1164
01:23:24,746 --> 01:23:27,568
You know, I think I told John that I wasn't coming to the meeting.

1165
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,389
John doesn't think I told him clear enough.

1166
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:30,971
We're going back and forth about that.

1167
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:32,432
That's not going to accomplish anything.

1168
01:23:32,572 --> 01:23:33,893
That's not going to move us forward.

1169
01:23:34,153 --> 01:23:37,796
Me calling John a liar, John calling me a liar, you knew, you didn't know.

1170
01:23:38,317 --> 01:23:41,159
No, that's not going to do anything to move Medford forward.

1171
01:23:41,299 --> 01:23:44,982
Ultimately, there are four counselors that are on the board that saw our problem.

1172
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,729
We saw our problem.

1173
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:51,412
We have 100 years of combined experience working in government, not as elected officials.

1174
01:23:51,512 --> 01:23:52,553
I mean working in government.

1175
01:23:52,993 --> 01:23:54,874
I've been working in government for a very long time.

1176
01:23:56,155 --> 01:23:57,536
That's where I was coming from with this.

1177
01:23:57,576 --> 01:24:02,259
It wasn't about heeding the advice of the director of the Board of Health because she never really gave us a straight answer.

1178
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,400
My answer was this.

1179
01:24:04,381 --> 01:24:05,021
My question was this.

1180
01:24:05,061 --> 01:24:07,443
Does the city council have the ability to meet non-virtually?

1181
01:24:08,363 --> 01:24:09,144
Her answer was, no.

1182
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:12,252
Not a yes or no answer, it was this, that, and the other thing.

1183
01:24:12,512 --> 01:24:14,053
Ultimately, government bodies are exempt.

1184
01:24:14,413 --> 01:24:15,634
That was all that I was looking for.

1185
01:24:15,654 --> 01:24:23,498
When we found out that government bodies were exempt, then there was an opportunity for us to further pursue in-person meetings or an in-person component for people to participate.

1186
01:24:24,744 --> 01:24:30,650
As I've stated earlier, I'm happy to be bound by the decision that's made by this working group that we've been able to agree upon earlier this evening.

1187
01:24:31,752 --> 01:24:33,754
And I look forward to sitting down and discussing the budget.

1188
01:24:33,794 --> 01:24:36,336
I'm a big procedural geek when it comes to this stuff.

1189
01:24:36,376 --> 01:24:37,377
I'm a student of the government.

1190
01:24:37,397 --> 01:24:39,099
I've been working in government for a long time.

1191
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:39,740
I studied it.

1192
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,602
You know, I continue to study it.

1193
01:24:42,162 --> 01:24:45,225
And it's something that I certainly enjoy doing.

1194
01:24:45,265 --> 01:24:49,028
It's something that I take great pleasure in being able to do.

1195
01:24:49,108 --> 01:24:53,131
It's something that I certainly am grateful for the opportunity to have.

1196
01:24:53,451 --> 01:24:56,734
And I'm glad that the people put me here to fight for them.

1197
01:24:56,754 --> 01:24:57,935
And that's what I was doing.

1198
01:24:58,215 --> 01:25:01,618
I was fighting for the people that called me and felt like they didn't have a voice, for the little guy.

1199
01:25:01,978 --> 01:25:09,424
You know, we hear time and time again that people talk about the vulnerable and marginalized populations that don't have anybody that's there to fight for them and there to talk for them.

1200
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:20,933
I was contacted by people that said to me, I can't believe that 111 teachers got laid off and they didn't have an opportunity to go to a meeting and talk about it.

1201
01:25:21,273 --> 01:25:22,494
That's concerning, and I get it.

1202
01:25:22,954 --> 01:25:30,816
We'll take the appropriate steps to be sure that we're safe, but ultimately, this is an opportunity for us to discuss about whether or not we can do things better.

1203
01:25:32,191 --> 01:25:33,912
You know, was there a breakdown in communication?

1204
01:25:33,952 --> 01:25:35,713
Yes, there was a breakdown in communication.

1205
01:25:35,993 --> 01:25:41,576
Have we been able to get past that and come up with a plan and a course of action to take so that we can move forward?

1206
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:42,156
We have.

1207
01:25:42,936 --> 01:25:51,721
You know, so I don't want anybody to think that, you know, the actions that I took were rooted in any type of malice or any type of, you know, act of disruption.

1208
01:25:52,381 --> 01:25:58,004
My concerns were brought to me by my constituents, my constituency that asked.

1209
01:25:58,264 --> 01:25:59,384
I want to have an opportunity.

1210
01:25:59,444 --> 01:26:00,965
I want to have a voice, and I want to be there.

1211
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:07,671
If someone's going to lay me off, I want to have the opportunity to sit in front of them and look them in the eye and ask them why and make sure that they feel the human aspect of it.

1212
01:26:08,192 --> 01:26:09,794
So, you know, that's where it's coming from.

1213
01:26:10,074 --> 01:26:11,976
Mr. Walsh, I certainly understand what you're saying.

1214
01:26:12,337 --> 01:26:12,938
I'm not a dummy.

1215
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:13,538
You know, I get it.

1216
01:26:13,558 --> 01:26:14,059
You know what I mean?

1217
01:26:14,099 --> 01:26:17,023
Public health professionals and public health professionals, none of us are in.

1218
01:26:18,082 --> 01:26:29,292
But based upon the phased-in reopening plan, the social distance guidelines, and what we're seeing, you know, in other communities, as well as across the city of Metro with reopening, I thought it was something that needed to be looked at further.

1219
01:26:29,352 --> 01:26:33,396
So, you know, I can certainly appreciate where you're coming from, and I'm not going to talk any longer than I already have to.

1220
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:34,857
You're next, Brock, don't worry, you're on.

1221
01:26:35,598 --> 01:26:40,442
But, you know, I just want to, I don't want you to think, you know, because my camera's off, I'm not listening.

1222
01:26:40,482 --> 01:26:42,544
My camera's off because I have some technical problems.

1223
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:49,544
When I have my camera off, my audio is better, so that's something that I'm dealing with personally.

1224
01:26:49,744 --> 01:26:57,108
Over the weekend, I had my friend Paul Hall's dad come over and he looked at everything and he freaking told me what to do and how to do it to improve my signal, and things are working better today.

1225
01:26:58,168 --> 01:27:02,551
We all have had to go through some growing pains and some learning pains to make this work.

1226
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:06,511
It's not a perfect format.

1227
01:27:06,811 --> 01:27:08,331
It's not something that everybody's used to.

1228
01:27:08,552 --> 01:27:12,153
It's not something that I'm particularly comfortable with.

1229
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:16,415
But, at the same time, if this is the way that we have to do business, this is the way that we have to do business.

1230
01:27:16,435 --> 01:27:17,656
This is the best alternative.

1231
01:27:17,696 --> 01:27:18,756
This is the best alternative.

1232
01:27:19,157 --> 01:27:24,119
But, I don't think we should stop having that discussion about when is it going to be possible for us to get back to work.

1233
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,221
So, Brock, thank you very much.

1234
01:27:26,261 --> 01:27:28,964
I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to blabber on and on about this.

1235
01:27:29,004 --> 01:27:29,464
I really do.

1236
01:27:29,524 --> 01:27:31,146
I talk far too long.

1237
01:27:31,927 --> 01:27:34,970
But that's where I was coming from.

1238
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:41,316
I know a lot of people are going to say a lot of the same, and I was going to try to wait until the end, but I also don't want you to ask a question and then hear crickets.

1239
01:27:41,997 --> 01:27:46,422
So I appreciate you entertaining me, and I do welcome further commentary.

1240
01:27:47,342 --> 01:27:47,623
Thank you.

1241
01:27:48,615 --> 01:27:54,640
And if I may, Brock, before you answer, at no point in time did I call Kumpel and I a night a liar.

1242
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,221
So I just wanted to make that clear.

1243
01:27:56,881 --> 01:27:59,283
And I'm not, I'm not, John, I'm not saying you did.

1244
01:27:59,423 --> 01:28:05,287
And that's not what I'm, you know, I'm saying we could go back and forth and say, who knew what, when, and you told me this and you didn't tell me, what's that going to do?

1245
01:28:05,307 --> 01:28:06,828
We're not two kids in the school yard.

1246
01:28:06,888 --> 01:28:08,329
You know what I mean?

1247
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:10,310
We've got a $184 million budget to tackle, baby.

1248
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:12,592
You know, so, you know, it's just a matter of how we're going to do it.

1249
01:28:12,852 --> 01:28:14,033
We're going to be comfortable doing it.

1250
01:28:14,173 --> 01:28:14,493
Correct.

1251
01:28:14,513 --> 01:28:15,514
We're on the right track.

1252
01:28:16,254 --> 01:28:16,515
Correct.

1253
01:28:18,892 --> 01:28:20,733
Yes, thank you, President Falco.

1254
01:28:21,393 --> 01:28:26,054
The confusion over the meeting that wound up not happening, notwithstanding.

1255
01:28:27,014 --> 01:28:33,816
I heard both President Falco and Councilor Knight referenced the communications from the Director of the Department of Public Health.

1256
01:28:34,597 --> 01:28:36,477
Are those communications a matter of public record?

1257
01:28:37,077 --> 01:28:47,380
And if so, would it be possible for us to hear that communication so we could hear what the answer that Councilor Knight received that confused him about what the recommendation was when it was so clear to President Falco?

1258
01:28:48,986 --> 01:28:50,668
I don't have it in front of me right now.

1259
01:28:50,848 --> 01:28:56,633
Uh, but what I did is I did release a statement to my colleagues, explaining them to them how I came up with my decision.

1260
01:28:57,413 --> 01:29:05,140
Um, you know, for me, as soon as the public health director said, yeah, she pretty much begged and pleaded, don't do this for me.

1261
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,621
That was all I needed to hear.

1262
01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:09,403
And that's why I moved it to zoom.

1263
01:29:10,204 --> 01:29:12,206
Um, if you want, I can send that to you.

1264
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:15,769
I think I put it out on Facebook, uh, the other day, but I can, I can, um,

1265
01:29:16,658 --> 01:29:26,745
Brock if you want I can maybe get you contact information and I'll be more than happy to send it To you or I can send it to the clerk and he can maybe if you want to contact him he can get it to you as well

1266
01:29:27,593 --> 01:29:29,174
I appreciate that President Falco, thank you.

1267
01:29:29,374 --> 01:29:30,494
No problem.

1268
01:29:30,534 --> 01:29:35,716
Mr. Walsh, I'm sure you can appreciate, I think I might have a couple of emails in my inbox after the last couple of days.

1269
01:29:35,736 --> 01:29:41,418
So I'm going to have to dig out that email, but what I will do is forward it to the city clerk as well.

1270
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:43,078
I appreciate that.

1271
01:29:43,098 --> 01:29:47,300
They can get it to you if you provide them with your contact information and do it the way you please, because there's nothing to hide.

1272
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:48,600
I appreciate that.

1273
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:49,140
Thank you.

1274
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:50,721
Thank you very much.

1275
01:29:51,441 --> 01:29:53,282
Let's see, we have a number of people here.

1276
01:29:55,368 --> 01:29:57,669
Thank you, Mr. President.

1277
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:00,430
I'll make my opinion known again.

1278
01:30:01,091 --> 01:30:08,614
I think you and I had had this discussion for many weeks, even before the upcoming budget, and we knew where this was going.

1279
01:30:09,534 --> 01:30:15,917
All I ever wanted was the seven counselors to be in a room with the department head,

1280
01:30:17,898 --> 01:30:21,561
And the clerk could run the Zoom part of the meeting.

1281
01:30:21,701 --> 01:30:29,026
Again, I think the gentleman who spoke earlier, Mr. Began, said we need that face-to-face dialogue.

1282
01:30:29,266 --> 01:30:31,727
And that's what I say.

1283
01:30:31,787 --> 01:30:38,552
The room could have been under 10 people, which would have been well within the realm of the law.

1284
01:30:39,192 --> 01:30:39,893
That's all there now.

1285
01:30:39,933 --> 01:30:44,096
And again, my intent was seven counselors, the clerk,

1286
01:30:44,836 --> 01:30:51,480
and the department head face-to-face, socially distancing, masks, whatever anybody needed.

1287
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:56,363
Again, there's plenty of rooms that we could have went to that are big enough to hold the Mr. President.

1288
01:30:56,423 --> 01:31:03,547
And that was only my intention, is to have the face-to-face meeting with the department head and have it for less than 10 people.

1289
01:31:04,547 --> 01:31:14,654
Again, there's no disrespect to anyone else, but again, and have, and no one ever said I, you know, never said I didn't want the Zoom, the Zoom, the clicker, the halo, the calls coming in from Zoom.

1290
01:31:15,034 --> 01:31:17,396
And that's my only reason.

1291
01:31:17,476 --> 01:31:21,538
I felt very strongly, again, about the face-to-face meeting.

1292
01:31:21,939 --> 01:31:26,802
And again, I think Mr. Began put it together, I couldn't have said it any better.

1293
01:31:27,742 --> 01:31:30,504
Sometimes you need to be face-to-face with somebody.

1294
01:31:31,204 --> 01:31:31,505
Thank you.

1295
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:32,826
Thank you.

1296
01:31:34,515 --> 01:31:38,058
Christy Avino, name and address for the record.

1297
01:31:38,538 --> 01:31:40,759
Yeah, thank you very much President Falco.

1298
01:31:40,819 --> 01:31:43,181
Christy Avino, 24 Carberry Street.

1299
01:31:43,461 --> 01:31:48,564
I'm a constituent, Medford homeowner, public school parent, and I'm the chair of the Medford Disabilities Commission.

1300
01:31:49,967 --> 01:31:59,278
Mr. President, I'm very concerned about the failure of the four absentee members to appear for the scheduled committee of the whole meetings over the last five days.

1301
01:31:59,379 --> 01:32:04,865
I attended all three meetings and was beyond disappointed that the absentee counselor did not appear.

1302
01:32:05,832 --> 01:32:13,294
tonight we have not heard any reason or valid excuse except that the determination of the Board of Health was one that they had disagreed with.

1303
01:32:14,254 --> 01:32:24,896
I am very pleased, however, that all counselors are now on the record as supporting remote participation via Zoom or another similar platform for these budget meetings going forward.

1304
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:32,818
Earlier today, I requested that the city, via President Falco, Mayor Lungo Kern, and Diversity and Inclusion Director Neil Osborne,

1305
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:42,366
provide American sign language interpretation, as well as closed captioning for these committee of the whole budget meetings and the final city council meeting voting on the budget.

1306
01:32:43,567 --> 01:32:52,897
I've requested that this be displayed on television and whatever remote platform is used, because there are serious barriers that are elected that are erected

1307
01:32:53,533 --> 01:33:01,678
to participation by people like myself who are deaf or hard of hearing, people who rely on lip reading and facial expression to understand.

1308
01:33:02,919 --> 01:33:10,124
In our recent disability commission meetings, which we have held by Zoom, the commission has discussed frequently

1309
01:33:10,889 --> 01:33:29,502
that the use of remote participation tools has really been a boon to increase participation in government and business and really all aspects of our community by people who are disabled, people who might have mobility issues, unable to get to City Hall, people who might otherwise have communication disabilities.

1310
01:33:29,822 --> 01:33:36,887
So this remote platform has really been a mechanism for the disability community to increase its participation.

1311
01:33:37,507 --> 01:33:51,237
I'm concerned that the original proposal that was set forth by Councillor Knight this morning, which did not include a remote platform and required the wearing of masks at any in-person meeting, would erect that barrier to participation.

1312
01:33:51,957 --> 01:33:56,040
Setting up a microphone next to a mask is no substitute for someone who relies on

1313
01:33:57,279 --> 01:33:59,340
to understand communication.

1314
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:12,245
So I expect that the city will meet its obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act and will honor my civil rights and all of those who are impacted by reduced accessibility that would potentially accompany these in-person meetings with masks.

1315
01:34:13,045 --> 01:34:14,306
As a point of information for

1316
01:34:15,143 --> 01:34:15,623
the public.

1317
01:34:15,884 --> 01:34:29,412
The mayor noted earlier today that our city has had more than effectively used Zoom for over 500 city meetings, over 10,000 participants, and over half a million minutes of meetings since this pandemic began.

1318
01:34:29,712 --> 01:34:33,595
As I mentioned, I've chaired multiple of these meetings for the Disabilities Commission here in Medford.

1319
01:34:33,895 --> 01:34:35,596
We found that it was an effective tool.

1320
01:34:36,569 --> 01:34:49,134
I understand, of course, that now the council is looking towards a hybrid mechanism, and I think that any solution that is proposed should take into account remote participation.

1321
01:34:50,654 --> 01:34:59,337
So, at the last three Committee of the Whole budget meetings, hundreds of members of the community appeared, countless city employees came prepared.

1322
01:34:59,697 --> 01:35:00,958
Thank you to everyone who showed

1323
01:35:02,801 --> 01:35:08,768
I was really disappointed to see that four councilors coordinated together to prevent the city council from reaching a quorum.

1324
01:35:08,808 --> 01:35:11,131
Point of information, Mr. President.

1325
01:35:11,351 --> 01:35:13,073
Point of information, Councilor Scott Pelley.

1326
01:35:13,493 --> 01:35:14,114
Again, please.

1327
01:35:15,015 --> 01:35:16,116
We did not.

1328
01:35:16,537 --> 01:35:18,799
I did not coordinate anything with anybody.

1329
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,761
Please stop doing that.

1330
01:35:21,821 --> 01:35:23,201
This is the second time it's been said.

1331
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:43,167
We did not, this is something, as a matter of fact, one of the constituents who called me, and I appreciate you bringing it up, is a person with hearing issues that asked for this meeting in person because they felt more comfortable watching the facial reactions because it's not reflected on Zoom sometimes if you're not on the first screen or the second screen.

1332
01:35:43,527 --> 01:35:44,888
So I applaud that, but please,

1333
01:35:45,908 --> 01:35:47,349
I made my decision on my own.

1334
01:35:47,389 --> 01:35:49,630
My fellow counselors said it again.

1335
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:56,554
We did not do anything underlying that has been stated somewhere out there.

1336
01:35:56,654 --> 01:35:59,435
All we're doing is making sure that everybody's involved.

1337
01:35:59,475 --> 01:35:59,955
That's it.

1338
01:36:01,056 --> 01:36:08,700
My final remarks are really, I think it's important for everyone to recognize

1339
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:12,481
because we have the power to choose who represents us in this government body.

1340
01:36:12,802 --> 01:36:19,785
We have the power to choose whether we maintain the status quo, and we have the power to choose to whom we give the power of quorum.

1341
01:36:20,045 --> 01:36:27,468
So to the city councilors who showed up and are advocating for increased community participation, who are showing up to do the work, thank you very much.

1342
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:31,249
Please keep it up and your efforts are not going unnoticed by the voters in this city.

1343
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:31,830
Thank you.

1344
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:32,610
Thank you.

1345
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:36,992
Now let's see, Jean Zotter, can we have your name and address for the record, please?

1346
01:36:39,691 --> 01:36:42,023
I want to thank everyone for waiting patiently, so thank you.

1347
01:36:43,634 --> 01:36:44,434
I'm Jean Zotter.

1348
01:36:44,474 --> 01:36:46,355
I live at 36 Saunders Street.

1349
01:36:47,995 --> 01:36:50,355
I'm someone who's at high risk for COVID.

1350
01:36:50,895 --> 01:36:58,017
I appreciate that the city councilors are now gonna allow Zoom so that I can have input into the city budget process.

1351
01:36:58,717 --> 01:37:07,938
I guess I wanna speak up in particular to city staff, other city councilors who may not wanna meet in person.

1352
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:09,599
I work in public health.

1353
01:37:09,959 --> 01:37:11,999
I think that it's really ill-advised

1354
01:37:12,539 --> 01:37:20,789
to meet in person at this time for a long meeting, especially if you're not going to be wearing your mask and you can't keep six feet of distance.

1355
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:26,476
And there may be, I know that you want to meet in person, be able to look people in the eye, but they may not want to be there.

1356
01:37:26,937 --> 01:37:30,521
But because they're city employees, they may feel like they have to show up.

1357
01:37:31,462 --> 01:37:34,545
they may have people who are high risk in their families.

1358
01:37:35,606 --> 01:37:40,551
And there may be city counselors who are worried about attending because they live with people who are high risk.

1359
01:37:41,111 --> 01:37:45,355
I think that this is COVID-19 and we have to adapt to the situation that we're in.

1360
01:37:45,896 --> 01:37:52,322
So if you do go ahead with an in-person meeting, I just encourage you to allow those people who

1361
01:37:53,640 --> 01:38:12,347
our city staff or city counselors and have high risk or are concerned about being there that they have another option for participating because they may feel like they have no choice but to show up and you may be putting them in a compromising situation that they're not comfortable with but don't feel like they can speak up.

1362
01:38:13,341 --> 01:38:13,981
Thank you so much.

1363
01:38:14,582 --> 01:38:15,282
Thank you very much.

1364
01:38:15,342 --> 01:38:21,486
I was actually someone that had expressed that same thought that you just had one of the employees.

1365
01:38:21,526 --> 01:38:23,387
So that's something that we do need to consider.

1366
01:38:24,268 --> 01:38:25,268
Thank you for bringing it up.

1367
01:38:25,748 --> 01:38:29,711
But yes, that is somewhat actually an employee to bring that to my attention.

1368
01:38:30,811 --> 01:38:31,812
So I agree.

1369
01:38:32,212 --> 01:38:32,573
Thank you.

1370
01:38:32,993 --> 01:38:33,273
Let's see.

1371
01:38:33,293 --> 01:38:36,075
We have Rebecca Schmeling.

1372
01:38:37,115 --> 01:38:38,336
Name and address for the record, please.

1373
01:38:38,356 --> 01:38:39,917
And I apologize if I got that wrong.

1374
01:38:45,801 --> 01:38:46,462
One second, Rebecca.

1375
01:38:46,942 --> 01:38:47,543
Okay, you're on.

1376
01:38:47,963 --> 01:38:49,425
Sorry, I tried to unmute myself.

1377
01:38:50,926 --> 01:38:52,008
My name is Rebecca Schmeling.

1378
01:38:52,048 --> 01:38:54,230
I'm at 206 Salem Street in Medford.

1379
01:38:55,491 --> 01:39:02,158
And I just want to speak a little bit to some of the language that's been kind of thrown around in the past.

1380
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:05,241
hour and 43 minutes.

1381
01:39:05,782 --> 01:39:16,552
I hear a lot of counselors talking about experience and how long they've been here and I hear this a lot lately and as a young person living in Medford, I'm not alone.

1382
01:39:16,572 --> 01:39:18,594
I think there's lots of young people here.

1383
01:39:19,034 --> 01:39:25,100
When you hear things like that and when you hear the two youngest counselors on the council getting kind of

1384
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:32,382
called out and, you know, for their inexperience and their youth and their whatever you want to call it.

1385
01:39:32,802 --> 01:39:41,124
It just feels a little bit like there is a feeling that, you know, if you've been here longer, if you've done it longer, you know, it's somehow better.

1386
01:39:41,144 --> 01:39:53,487
And, you know, I mean, I'm hearing these words about not getting into arguments, but Elisa was speaking so kindly and calmly and was basically interrupted and yelled at by a counselor.

1387
01:39:54,867 --> 01:40:11,405
you know, there's divisions are sewn when people who feel that they've been here for a long time and know everything don't want to listen to people who have started showing up and I just, you know, I'm sure you'll yell back at me that I have heard things wrong and misinterpreted things, but I want to say that it really

1388
01:40:11,825 --> 01:40:13,527
It does feel that way for young people.

1389
01:40:13,587 --> 01:40:15,488
It's not easy to get involved.

1390
01:40:15,548 --> 01:40:23,175
And when there are people who, as soon as you say, it frustrated me that you did it this way, you say, don't call me this, don't call me that.

1391
01:40:23,756 --> 01:40:27,679
It doesn't feel like what's the point of showing up and saying your opinion.

1392
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:42,606
I just want to ask counselors to be a little careful about the language and kind of the tone that they're using, because I haven't been to many council meetings, but I'm here now, and I want to feel like I can keep coming, and I want to feel, you know, invited to that table, so.

1393
01:40:44,867 --> 01:40:46,587
Thank you, Rebecca.

1394
01:40:47,308 --> 01:40:49,929
Rebecca, I'm sorry, you all, I just want to make sure you're all set.

1395
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:52,650
You're done?

1396
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:53,430
Okay, thank you.

1397
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,971
Let's see, we have Kit Collins.

1398
01:40:56,111 --> 01:40:57,592
Name and address for the record, please.

1399
01:41:00,023 --> 01:41:00,483
Can you hear me?

1400
01:41:00,503 --> 01:41:01,964
Yeah Great.

1401
01:41:02,084 --> 01:41:03,184
My name is kip collins.

1402
01:41:03,244 --> 01:41:05,385
I live at 42 william street in medford.

1403
01:41:05,665 --> 01:41:25,491
I'm, just holding my mic kind of close because it's kind of bad um, I would just like to make a comment that I think that In this moment as the pandemic as much as we might hate to admit it is still very much ongoing It's going to be going on for a very long time, even though that's a reality that nobody is happy about I think that

1404
01:41:26,336 --> 01:41:33,979
a really important part of the city council's leadership is to be a leader in how we are modeling behavior for how to act during a pandemic.

1405
01:41:34,579 --> 01:41:39,061
I think it is, we're not even getting close to the time where we can begin going back to normal safely.

1406
01:41:39,081 --> 01:41:42,823
And I think that the actions of the city council, not just in how

1407
01:41:43,463 --> 01:41:56,891
the budget meetings turn out, but in general the tone of what is acceptable, what is enthusiastically participated in, should be considered modeling for the whole Medford community as how we should be conducting ourselves safely during a pandemic.

1408
01:41:56,971 --> 01:42:00,193
And I bring this up, I think it's most important because it's not just for

1409
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:13,245
The health of the people who will literally be in that room and their families I really think that it's important for us all to remember that this pandemic And infectious disease and health health in general is a racial justice issue.

1410
01:42:13,686 --> 01:42:20,689
It is an economic justice issue We cannot forget just because the pandemic is wearing on It's becoming increasingly inconvenient.

1411
01:42:21,069 --> 01:42:30,173
It's becoming increasingly tedious That um, you know, they're the most vulnerable members of our community are still being put at the most risk when more people go out

1412
01:42:30,733 --> 01:42:39,936
Become carriers without knowing it continue to spread this disease We are very far away along from having a vaccine and I think that even though it really stinks.

1413
01:42:40,356 --> 01:42:54,920
We all need to dial down Remain in the mindset of protecting our communities and I would really love to see the medford city council embody that spirit of protecting the most vulnerable as well through what they are willing to enthusiastically do

1414
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:58,503
to support one another and protect each other from this disease.

1415
01:42:58,523 --> 01:42:59,925
Thanks.

1416
01:43:00,285 --> 01:43:01,006
Thank you very much.

1417
01:43:01,867 --> 01:43:06,693
Eaton Gleiner, name and address for the record, please.

1418
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:08,839
Thank you, President Falco.

1419
01:43:08,859 --> 01:43:10,100
My name is Eitan Gleinert.

1420
01:43:10,281 --> 01:43:14,144
I live at 374 Winthrop Street.

1421
01:43:14,545 --> 01:43:16,106
I have two things I want to say.

1422
01:43:16,426 --> 01:43:25,595
The first is that if I didn't show up for work three times in a row and I didn't offer any explanation and I just went radio silent, I wouldn't have a job anymore.

1423
01:43:26,175 --> 01:43:28,696
And I think that's something that we should just be aware of.

1424
01:43:29,236 --> 01:43:38,401
And then the other thing is the excuse that we are being given for why not all the councillors showed up for these meetings is because it was to increase accessibility.

1425
01:43:38,421 --> 01:43:40,181
It was to increase transparency.

1426
01:43:40,622 --> 01:43:42,382
Well, I think that's a bit of a contradiction.

1427
01:43:42,762 --> 01:43:46,704
The issue at hand that needs to be decided by the end of the month is the budget.

1428
01:43:47,044 --> 01:43:48,785
That is the big, important issue.

1429
01:43:49,145 --> 01:43:52,667
And here we are a week to go, we're not even talking about the budget.

1430
01:43:53,007 --> 01:43:57,189
We're talking about whether or not people should show up for meetings and how Zoom works.

1431
01:43:57,610 --> 01:43:58,170
It's crazy.

1432
01:43:58,210 --> 01:44:01,912
We've basically reduced the window for how long we have to talk about this.

1433
01:44:02,352 --> 01:44:05,934
We've reduced the window for how long people have to give input and feedback.

1434
01:44:06,314 --> 01:44:09,216
And so if anything, this stunt is reducing accessibility.

1435
01:44:09,256 --> 01:44:13,278
So it just feels contradictory when we get told this is to make sure everybody can join.

1436
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:16,740
Thank you.

1437
01:44:19,402 --> 01:44:20,022
Molly Norton.

1438
01:44:24,186 --> 01:44:25,610
Hi, my name is Marlee Norton.

1439
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:28,999
I live at 215 Harvard Street, unit 6.

1440
01:44:31,410 --> 01:44:42,479
When I first bought my house in Medford two years ago and moved to the area, I asked other people what it would be like in terms of the civic responsibility.

1441
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,801
I've always tried to be very aware.

1442
01:44:44,841 --> 01:44:51,827
And what I was told at that time was no one wants to hear what you have to think until you've lived here 10 years.

1443
01:44:52,668 --> 01:44:56,331
And by the time you have lived here 10 years, they will say they don't care until it's 20 years.

1444
01:44:58,762 --> 01:45:09,889
The feeling I have gotten in general from a lot of Medford, and honestly from this council meeting, is that seniority is the most important thing.

1445
01:45:09,949 --> 01:45:15,713
I'm hearing language thrown around like senior and junior council members, which I do not believe is a formal role.

1446
01:45:16,774 --> 01:45:17,754
That was invented.

1447
01:45:18,395 --> 01:45:27,721
And while I'm glad to hear there is experience in the room, that does not mean that people who are new to this role have less of a right or less of a voice.

1448
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:47,793
The day I moved to Medford my vote was just as valid as anyone else's vote in Medford and the council members who are new to the committee are there because Medford voters put them there and want them there and they reflect our views and

1449
01:45:49,993 --> 01:45:53,914
I want to thank Rebecca Schmeling for bringing this up.

1450
01:45:53,974 --> 01:45:55,195
It was bothering me, too.

1451
01:45:55,295 --> 01:45:56,996
Thanks for the lead in.

1452
01:45:57,876 --> 01:45:59,197
I want to elevate what she was saying.

1453
01:45:59,257 --> 01:46:00,797
It makes me feel very unwelcome.

1454
01:46:00,817 --> 01:46:02,158
This is my first council meeting.

1455
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:11,822
And I have to say, I have formed opinions on all of the council members, possibly not the ones you wanted me to.

1456
01:46:12,943 --> 01:46:13,603
In particular,

1457
01:46:14,082 --> 01:46:15,602
the absenteeism.

1458
01:46:16,183 --> 01:46:21,004
I am very disappointed to hear about that, and I will be taking my disappointment to the ballot box next year.

1459
01:46:22,764 --> 01:46:23,125
Thank you.

1460
01:46:24,065 --> 01:46:29,066
Let's see, we have Abdias Newton.

1461
01:46:31,367 --> 01:46:32,647
I apologize if I got that wrong.

1462
01:46:32,667 --> 01:46:36,668
Yeah, that's Abdias Newton.

1463
01:46:37,128 --> 01:46:39,869
Yeah, that's Abdias Newton.

1464
01:46:40,049 --> 01:46:42,170
I'm sorry, we need name and address for the record, please.

1465
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:46,553
Yeah, add this to an address 214 Middlesex Avenue, Medford.

1466
01:46:47,714 --> 01:47:02,146
Something that one of the counselors said actually troubled me because they were going on about this one person and they just said that there's only 10 people that can be inside that room.

1467
01:47:02,526 --> 01:47:03,927
There is 14 counselors.

1468
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:07,670
So how is that one person going to participate under their COVID-19?

1469
01:47:07,691 --> 01:47:09,552
It's a contradiction that does not make sense.

1470
01:47:09,912 --> 01:47:11,954
And it cancels itself out when you really think about it.

1471
01:47:12,413 --> 01:47:20,286
When it comes to these meetings, when we're meeting together, you've never seen this much people in a budget hearing.

1472
01:47:20,306 --> 01:47:23,532
The people are interested in the meeting and they're interested in their own community.

1473
01:47:23,928 --> 01:47:33,255
Now, to put this one person over everyone else, it's like we don't live in a democracy anymore, because you have to understand what a democracy is.

1474
01:47:33,575 --> 01:47:35,457
A democracy is the majority.

1475
01:47:35,757 --> 01:47:37,058
We are basically the majority.

1476
01:47:37,418 --> 01:47:40,160
If one person doesn't vote for you, that doesn't mean you don't win an election.

1477
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,443
That means that one person didn't vote for you.

1478
01:47:43,523 --> 01:47:45,804
And you still win if that one person still doesn't vote for you.

1479
01:47:46,085 --> 01:47:48,807
So it troubles me when they're mentioning this one person.

1480
01:47:49,227 --> 01:47:52,029
Also, someone also mentioned, what's it called?

1481
01:47:52,674 --> 01:48:02,620
a rally that happened recently, but when the mayor spoke at a rally and the police, she spoke at a rally and there was people packed in a stadium like sardines.

1482
01:48:03,041 --> 01:48:05,322
No one said anything about not attending any meetings.

1483
01:48:06,553 --> 01:48:12,517
It's only when there's another rally that they use that as an excuse.

1484
01:48:12,797 --> 01:48:18,380
It's subterfuge to the fact that it seems that they don't want people to actually see what's happening in these budget meetings.

1485
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,601
That's what I'm getting the feeling of.

1486
01:48:19,881 --> 01:48:26,825
This seniority and all this basically gatekeeping, it really troubles me.

1487
01:48:27,145 --> 01:48:28,545
And my parents have COVID.

1488
01:48:28,725 --> 01:48:34,566
So when it comes to going to the meeting, that's not a possibility for me.

1489
01:48:35,226 --> 01:48:41,007
So it's troubling that people in this day and age don't listen to the health officials.

1490
01:48:41,307 --> 01:48:47,709
They rather just go on their own agenda and just do whatever they want to do, even though people in Medford voted them in.

1491
01:48:48,109 --> 01:48:55,370
I want to let everyone who was absent know that we are watching you, and we are also going to take it to the ballot, because this is not acceptable.

1492
01:48:55,830 --> 01:49:00,193
If I were to not show up at my job for three days in a row, I'd get fired.

1493
01:49:00,433 --> 01:49:06,818
So it feels like they're taking advantage of the fact that they can't get kicked out of the...

1494
01:49:08,573 --> 01:49:11,795
of their own seats, because this is unacceptable.

1495
01:49:12,095 --> 01:49:20,499
You know, I've been living in Medford for 20 years, and when it comes to taking part in government stuff, I just started, you know what I'm saying?

1496
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:22,500
So it's crazy.

1497
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:24,681
And also, the second wave of corona is about to hit.

1498
01:49:25,022 --> 01:49:29,204
So when people say that we need to go in public, that's not safe for anybody.

1499
01:49:29,444 --> 01:49:33,566
And anyone who's saying that, they're not listening to the health officials, and they're not listening to reality.

1500
01:49:33,927 --> 01:49:36,729
because the second wave of coronavirus is going to be more deadly than the first.

1501
01:49:37,169 --> 01:49:40,572
And always, one person will always disagree with whatever you say, OK?

1502
01:49:40,772 --> 01:49:42,653
So you're not going to get everyone on your side.

1503
01:49:42,873 --> 01:49:48,718
This one person that doesn't agree with the meetings, they're not indicative of the entire effort.

1504
01:49:48,798 --> 01:49:50,619
One person is always going to disagree.

1505
01:49:50,799 --> 01:49:54,682
That's not an excuse to not show up to the meetings and do your job.

1506
01:49:55,122 --> 01:50:03,504
And that's what really got me upset because we are we are out here all doing our jobs to help better this community And these people these people need these these these counselors.

1507
01:50:03,684 --> 01:50:07,645
They're not doing their jobs The budget meeting is is now being talked about zoom.

1508
01:50:07,925 --> 01:50:14,987
No one cares about the zoom people have availability to zoom right now What we care about is the budget meaning and and money that's going into our communities.

1509
01:50:15,367 --> 01:50:24,549
So it's it's it's it's basically it's it's it's it's it's frustrating to have to go through this again and again and again and and and it's it's it's

1510
01:50:26,995 --> 01:50:28,963
It's just something that is unacceptable.

1511
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:33,826
As a member of the community, I don't see this as productive at all.

1512
01:50:34,126 --> 01:50:39,169
And the majority of people in this Zoom do not see this as productive at all.

1513
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:50,236
That one person who would put people in danger for COVID-19 basically has taken this to a different place, where we're just speaking about the budget.

1514
01:50:50,477 --> 01:50:51,617
We ain't speaking about the budget no more.

1515
01:50:51,637 --> 01:50:52,378
We're talking about Zoom.

1516
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:58,001
that is self-destructive towards the community.

1517
01:50:58,342 --> 01:51:05,766
So we need to be more inclusive in our community because I'm Black, so people are marginalized in my community.

1518
01:51:05,846 --> 01:51:09,268
When it comes to that type of stuff, you guys talk about marginalized voices, guess what?

1519
01:51:09,488 --> 01:51:10,669
My voice is marginalized.

1520
01:51:10,889 --> 01:51:12,490
So you're going to silence me and my people because one person?

1521
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:13,190
You have to understand that

1522
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:22,252
When it comes to COVID rates, our community is decimated by racism.

1523
01:51:22,493 --> 01:51:25,615
We just said, bro, racism was a health issue.

1524
01:51:26,155 --> 01:51:33,339
And now people want to go inside public to give people like me COVID when it comes to public meetings.

1525
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,781
This doesn't make sense.

1526
01:51:35,821 --> 01:51:41,845
And if those people who were absent voted on that, then I don't believe you when you say racism is a public health issue.

1527
01:51:42,505 --> 01:51:54,129
when it comes to my people dying from this disease, you're advocating for us to go in public and risk our lives for the budget meeting when it could be said right here, right now.

1528
01:51:57,710 --> 01:51:58,111
Thank you.

1529
01:51:58,131 --> 01:52:04,333
Okay, we have, let's see here.

1530
01:52:10,054 --> 01:52:12,675
John Costas, name and address for the record, please.

1531
01:52:19,637 --> 01:52:20,357
Okay, hi.

1532
01:52:20,797 --> 01:52:20,997
Hi.

1533
01:52:21,538 --> 01:52:23,838
John Costas, 56 Hain Street, Medford.

1534
01:52:25,179 --> 01:52:38,883
I've been listening and listening and keeping quiet, but what I don't understand is why are so many people that are speaking trying to make it sound like the four councillors were opposed to Zoom?

1535
01:52:40,248 --> 01:52:43,449
Not once did any of the four councillors say Zoom was bad.

1536
01:52:44,149 --> 01:52:45,189
Zoom is no good.

1537
01:52:45,589 --> 01:52:46,730
We don't want Zoom.

1538
01:52:47,850 --> 01:52:51,471
All four councillors had nothing wrong with Zoom.

1539
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:53,671
They wanted to do it live as well.

1540
01:52:54,591 --> 01:53:02,933
And I think it would be great if everybody that is speaking don't try to put words in the councillors' mouths by saying no Zoom.

1541
01:53:04,634 --> 01:53:08,975
As far as the issue with contamination and COVID-19, I mean, as of Monday,

1542
01:53:10,514 --> 01:53:11,194
things are open.

1543
01:53:12,115 --> 01:53:20,042
And if you have a problem or concern about catching COVID-19, you have an option for Zoom.

1544
01:53:21,323 --> 01:53:27,929
There was never, ever, ever anything said by any counselor that you couldn't go to Zoom and speak your mind.

1545
01:53:28,569 --> 01:53:29,310
And you get 263 people on Zoom.

1546
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:29,530
Odds are

1547
01:53:33,917 --> 01:53:43,600
If you had the meetings when you're supposed to have the meetings, you still would have had 263 people on Zoom who had the right to speak their mind as they're doing now.

1548
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:51,822
So I think it'd be great if, you know, you stop attacking the counselors because they wanted to do something live.

1549
01:53:52,923 --> 01:53:54,583
I mean, it is your choice.

1550
01:53:55,023 --> 01:53:56,004
This is America.

1551
01:53:57,024 --> 01:54:00,745
Nobody has the right to tell somebody else what they need to do.

1552
01:54:02,042 --> 01:54:19,633
And if a bunch of people want to meet in person, follow the rules and regulations set up by the governor of the state using proper distances, it is their right as a citizen and a taxpayer to do what they need to do following all rules and regulations.

1553
01:54:20,334 --> 01:54:27,458
I think people need to stop hiding behind other factors to get their own personal agenda behind this.

1554
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:29,600
They stood their ground.

1555
01:54:30,642 --> 01:54:32,303
Was it right they stood their ground?

1556
01:54:32,343 --> 01:54:34,145
Was it wrong where they stood their ground?

1557
01:54:34,385 --> 01:54:37,667
Well, that's up to the individual counselors that stood their ground.

1558
01:54:39,068 --> 01:54:42,531
I'm saying, stop putting words in their mouth.

1559
01:54:42,971 --> 01:54:45,633
They never said no Zoom.

1560
01:54:46,374 --> 01:54:50,297
They just preferred to meet what the people wanted.

1561
01:54:50,998 --> 01:54:52,919
And there was a lot of venues they could have done it in.

1562
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:55,141
And everything is open now.

1563
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:55,341
So

1564
01:54:56,238 --> 01:55:03,760
All I can ask everybody to do is follow the proper precautions, follow the local, follow the state guidelines.

1565
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:07,161
Life goes on and we're moving on with life.

1566
01:55:08,101 --> 01:55:11,402
Just obey the rules as established by the governor.

1567
01:55:11,662 --> 01:55:12,022
Thank you.

1568
01:55:12,522 --> 01:55:13,402
Point of information.

1569
01:55:13,883 --> 01:55:15,383
Point of information, Councilor Morrell.

1570
01:55:15,683 --> 01:55:16,283
Thank you, John.

1571
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:23,665
I just want to clarify that the phases of the reopening are not set by the belief that COVID is no longer a threat.

1572
01:55:24,089 --> 01:55:28,170
It's based on the fact that there's now room in the hospital should more people get ill to that point.

1573
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:29,010
Thank you.

1574
01:55:30,931 --> 01:55:31,931
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1575
01:55:32,831 --> 01:55:35,712
Let's see, we have... What did you say?

1576
01:55:36,412 --> 01:55:38,393
Just talked about the people still going.

1577
01:55:38,433 --> 01:55:39,133
Marshall.

1578
01:55:41,794 --> 01:55:43,134
Is it not?

1579
01:55:43,274 --> 01:55:43,954
I'm sorry.

1580
01:55:44,054 --> 01:55:44,815
I apologize.

1581
01:55:44,835 --> 01:55:48,195
That was fine.

1582
01:55:48,716 --> 01:55:49,756
Name and address for the record.

1583
01:55:51,776 --> 01:55:52,237
Can you hear me?

1584
01:55:52,617 --> 01:55:53,197
Yes, I can.

1585
01:55:53,437 --> 01:55:53,697
We can.

1586
01:55:54,278 --> 01:55:55,959
Marshal Mouton of 33 Watervale.

1587
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:05,324
I agree that perhaps we should move away from the discussion about Zoom versus not Zoom.

1588
01:56:05,544 --> 01:56:16,069
The point I would like to make and the question I'd like to ask the council is it felt like two council meetings ago, there was a lot of urgency about getting a budget in hand.

1589
01:56:16,569 --> 01:56:18,670
It was all about, show me the budget, where's the budget?

1590
01:56:19,371 --> 01:56:23,273
And the budget's there, and it seems as though the urgency has left.

1591
01:56:24,121 --> 01:56:27,482
there's no more urgency to get this done.

1592
01:56:28,323 --> 01:56:30,384
To the point where it's being actively delayed.

1593
01:56:31,424 --> 01:56:44,209
And I think whether or not we're talking about, you know, it'll be a little bit better to hash it out in person or not, like, what I was hearing two budget meetings ago is that it is urgent.

1594
01:56:45,169 --> 01:56:51,292
And so I don't see why we can't get started as soon as we could have, which was this past weekend.

1595
01:56:51,863 --> 01:56:52,883
That's the point I would like to make.

1596
01:56:53,543 --> 01:56:56,484
Where is the urgency now?

1597
01:56:56,504 --> 01:56:59,185
Mr. President, if I can respond to that.

1598
01:56:59,425 --> 01:57:00,465
Yes, Councilor Knight.

1599
01:57:01,325 --> 01:57:05,406
Mr. President, normal practice has been that the mayor would introduce the budget on the council agenda.

1600
01:57:06,226 --> 01:57:11,087
And if we look back to past practice, this has happened pretty much every year.

1601
01:57:11,567 --> 01:57:13,748
Last year, it didn't happen, but it should have.

1602
01:57:14,778 --> 01:57:18,741
Pursuant to chapter 44, section 32, it says the mayor has to introduce the budget.

1603
01:57:19,142 --> 01:57:25,086
And the normal practice that the council has always gone through would be that the mayor has introduced their budget and this has shown up on the council agenda.

1604
01:57:25,787 --> 01:57:31,051
It's been given a council paper number and then the budget proceedings have been scheduled.

1605
01:57:31,491 --> 01:57:37,195
And the reason that this is important to note is because when the budget is introduced, the council is bound by a certain period of time to act.

1606
01:57:38,016 --> 01:57:40,998
So when we want to see the budget, we want to see the budget introduced.

1607
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:43,945
the budget introduced properly, then we can set up the meetings.

1608
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:46,246
Then we have 45 days to act by law.

1609
01:57:46,306 --> 01:57:48,728
We have to either vote a yes or no within 45 days.

1610
01:57:49,108 --> 01:57:50,029
That's what the law says.

1611
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:53,432
So, Mr. President, I think part of the concern is this.

1612
01:57:54,152 --> 01:57:57,795
I didn't feel as though the budget was introduced properly because I didn't see it show up on the agenda.

1613
01:57:58,375 --> 01:58:07,402
Now, we've already gotten concerns and questions about whether or not we violated the open meeting law when we put Adams on under suspension.

1614
01:58:08,155 --> 01:58:14,699
There's been a lot of talk about whether or not this Zoom platform allows us to communicate effectively between all of us.

1615
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:17,220
And I have my doubts.

1616
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:21,803
I don't think that this is the best method for me to do my job, as I've said this before.

1617
01:58:22,423 --> 01:58:24,464
But if it's the best that I got, it's the best that I got.

1618
01:58:25,405 --> 01:58:29,487
I'd much rather be in the same room looking somebody in the eye and working with them, beside them.

1619
01:58:29,667 --> 01:58:30,767
We're going to play on the same team.

1620
01:58:30,787 --> 01:58:31,808
We've got to be on the same court.

1621
01:58:32,808 --> 01:58:34,990
But, in terms of, you know, where's the budget?

1622
01:58:35,010 --> 01:58:35,591
Where's the budget?

1623
01:58:35,611 --> 01:58:37,732
Yeah, I wanted the budget, Mr. President, and I still do.

1624
01:58:37,852 --> 01:58:38,873
I want it to be introduced.

1625
01:58:39,313 --> 01:58:48,261
And it's my understanding that, you know, the mayor had dropped the budget off into the clerk's office by 6-18, and, you know, there was an error that occurred.

1626
01:58:49,081 --> 01:58:50,062
There's no other way to put it.

1627
01:58:50,082 --> 01:58:51,363
There was an error that occurred, a mistake.

1628
01:58:51,951 --> 01:58:55,136
And I don't hold the clerk's feet to the fire for it, you know what I mean?

1629
01:58:55,196 --> 01:59:00,625
It's been very difficult and these have been very trying times trying to live our lives through email and through virtual reality.

1630
01:59:01,286 --> 01:59:05,313
But with that being said, you know, if the budget were on the agenda this evening,

1631
01:59:06,348 --> 01:59:09,710
and showed up on the agenda this evening, it was introduced, I'd be at the meetings.

1632
01:59:11,091 --> 01:59:16,134
The question was, we voted to have meetings one way, the budget was never introduced and then the budget hearings were scheduled.

1633
01:59:16,214 --> 01:59:19,536
So it became a procedural mess and I got very, very concerned and very confused.

1634
01:59:20,076 --> 01:59:32,763
Matt, coupled with the fact that I've gotten tons of calls about people that wanted to participate live, put me in a position to say, is there a way that we can address some of these concerns that are out there in the community so that it'll work for everyone?

1635
01:59:33,983 --> 01:59:36,146
There's no malintent, there's no ill will.

1636
01:59:36,467 --> 01:59:38,009
We're not trying to delay budget hearings.

1637
01:59:38,029 --> 01:59:40,032
We're not trying to make it so nobody gets to talk.

1638
01:59:41,134 --> 01:59:42,716
That's just not a reality.

1639
01:59:42,756 --> 01:59:43,857
That's not the narrative.

1640
01:59:44,078 --> 01:59:46,381
That's what's being painted, but it's not the reality.

1641
01:59:47,803 --> 01:59:49,506
Ultimately, at the end of the day,

1642
01:59:50,343 --> 01:59:52,284
We all work very well together.

1643
01:59:52,404 --> 01:59:56,426
We've put out great work products in the past, and we're going to continue to do so.

1644
01:59:57,207 --> 01:59:58,627
All this is is a scheduling issue.

1645
01:59:58,687 --> 02:00:03,050
It's something that we had concerns about, you know, me personally and colleagues.

1646
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:04,730
And they've all said, you know, where they're coming from.

1647
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:05,591
There's no ill will.

1648
02:00:05,911 --> 02:00:10,713
This wasn't some organized attempt to stall the way the government works.

1649
02:00:11,654 --> 02:00:17,437
You know, it was four counselors that had a belief, and their individual beliefs led them to take action.

1650
02:00:18,219 --> 02:00:26,696
And if individual beliefs lead you to take action, I think that that's one of the foundations that public participation is rooted on.

1651
02:00:26,716 --> 02:00:27,778
I have individual beliefs.

1652
02:00:27,818 --> 02:00:28,639
I want to take action.

1653
02:00:28,659 --> 02:00:29,822
So I'm going to go and participate.

1654
02:00:30,504 --> 02:00:33,087
And we just wanted to make that easier or better for people.

1655
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:35,990
Zoom, no Zoom, it is what it is.

1656
02:00:36,991 --> 02:00:38,633
I'm not crazy about this platform.

1657
02:00:38,753 --> 02:00:39,434
I don't like it.

1658
02:00:39,654 --> 02:00:40,795
I'm a people person.

1659
02:00:40,815 --> 02:00:42,016
I want to be around people.

1660
02:00:42,097 --> 02:00:50,546
I don't want to be stuck in my kitchen with my kids locked in the cellar and they can't use the internet because my bandwidth is weak and I'm having technical difficulties.

1661
02:00:50,606 --> 02:00:52,528
I want to be able to roll up my sleeves and get to work.

1662
02:00:53,428 --> 02:00:58,131
But, the way to do that, you know, because, you know, the city council is a government body.

1663
02:00:58,251 --> 02:01:00,112
You know, Facebook isn't a government body.

1664
02:01:00,232 --> 02:01:01,573
Twitter isn't a government body.

1665
02:01:02,093 --> 02:01:07,776
The city council is a government body, and we need to respect and adhere to certain principles and processes.

1666
02:01:07,996 --> 02:01:09,277
And I got a concern.

1667
02:01:09,817 --> 02:01:15,420
A concern, you know, I think it was a significant concern, and it's something that we've been able to work past and address.

1668
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:19,302
And I've talked to the city clerk about it a thousand times, and I've talked to the council president about it.

1669
02:01:19,662 --> 02:01:21,283
I've talked to past council presidents about it.

1670
02:01:21,637 --> 02:01:22,818
It's something we're going to overcome.

1671
02:01:24,899 --> 02:01:32,303
There's a picture being painted that there's four counselors that are going to have pitchforks in their hands, and they're going to run down to Byrne City Hall.

1672
02:01:32,703 --> 02:01:34,324
That's not the case at all.

1673
02:01:34,804 --> 02:01:39,066
And that narrative that's being portrayed is absolutely contrary to reality.

1674
02:01:40,287 --> 02:01:47,791
Procedural concerns, operational concerns, functional concerns, they were all legitimate, legitimate concerns.

1675
02:01:47,891 --> 02:01:50,452
You might not agree with the reasoning

1676
02:01:51,235 --> 02:01:53,017
for the stand that somebody took.

1677
02:01:53,377 --> 02:01:56,620
But you have to appreciate the fact that we believed in something.

1678
02:01:56,921 --> 02:01:59,143
Individuals believed in something and took a stand for something.

1679
02:01:59,483 --> 02:02:00,524
That's all this is about.

1680
02:02:01,525 --> 02:02:02,526
We're going to get past this.

1681
02:02:02,806 --> 02:02:04,388
We're going to get a fiscal year budget done.

1682
02:02:04,628 --> 02:02:12,416
We're going to set up a budget hearing schedule in a fashion that's going to work for us, or at least in a fashion where we take another bite at the apple to see if we can do better.

1683
02:02:13,497 --> 02:02:14,898
That's where I'm coming from, Mr. President.

1684
02:02:15,245 --> 02:02:16,926
This wasn't an effort to stop things.

1685
02:02:16,966 --> 02:02:21,350
This was an effort to improve things, to see if we can do better and to address concerns that we were hearing.

1686
02:02:22,571 --> 02:02:26,374
So I can certainly appreciate where everybody's coming from.

1687
02:02:26,414 --> 02:02:28,455
But there was no ill will.

1688
02:02:28,715 --> 02:02:34,320
The reality of the situation is not that the budget wants to be stopped by these four councilors.

1689
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:35,861
We're individuals that are acting.

1690
02:02:36,261 --> 02:02:43,587
And when I said that the four senior members of the council, that wasn't saying that the other members of the council voice was any less important.

1691
02:02:44,852 --> 02:02:47,573
What I was saying was that there are people that have experience.

1692
02:02:49,113 --> 02:02:50,454
Experience is important.

1693
02:02:50,694 --> 02:02:52,034
Experience does matter.

1694
02:02:53,895 --> 02:02:55,376
That's what I was getting at.

1695
02:02:55,876 --> 02:02:59,677
The four senior members of the council, and I said senior members just because we have the most

1696
02:03:00,512 --> 02:03:04,553
It doesn't mean that we're better or worse than anybody else that serves on the board.

1697
02:03:04,994 --> 02:03:08,935
It just means that we've experienced these situations more frequently.

1698
02:03:08,995 --> 02:03:11,936
We've had more life experiences dealing with it.

1699
02:03:12,296 --> 02:03:19,358
When it doesn't pass the smell test before people, then maybe it is something that warrants another look.

1700
02:03:19,758 --> 02:03:23,720
We could go on and on all night long, you know what I mean, and throw stones and talk

1701
02:03:24,838 --> 02:03:30,881
what the narrative is on social media and why we're here today because of it.

1702
02:03:31,001 --> 02:03:35,423
But at the end of the day, we've been able to work out a solution and a plan to move forward.

1703
02:03:35,724 --> 02:03:38,725
And I hope that as the night progresses, we can do that.

1704
02:03:40,506 --> 02:03:41,446
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1705
02:03:42,107 --> 02:03:46,209
Let's see, we have Jessica Schiller.

1706
02:03:48,730 --> 02:03:49,410
I'm sorry, Jessie.

1707
02:03:50,831 --> 02:03:52,192
Name and address for the record, please.

1708
02:03:52,965 --> 02:03:55,558
Hi, my name's Jessie Schiller and I'm at 55 Whitney Road.

1709
02:03:59,249 --> 02:04:01,370
Thank you so much to everybody who came tonight.

1710
02:04:01,410 --> 02:04:11,073
This is actually my first meeting and we just moved to the city back in October and had our first child who's now eight months old.

1711
02:04:11,353 --> 02:04:12,173
Congratulations.

1712
02:04:12,514 --> 02:04:13,794
Thank you, thank you.

1713
02:04:13,994 --> 02:04:17,375
And we're really excited to be able to participate from home.

1714
02:04:18,555 --> 02:04:26,178
I just wanted to address the four counselors who haven't been able to come to the last couple meetings and I appreciate you

1715
02:04:26,813 --> 02:04:29,576
speaking up and advocating for constituents.

1716
02:04:29,756 --> 02:04:41,229
And I just want to call out that I haven't heard you respond to any of the positive and meaningful feedback that the other participants have contributed to this conversation.

1717
02:04:41,309 --> 02:04:44,353
I've only heard defensive responses.

1718
02:04:45,094 --> 02:04:46,516
And that's very disappointing to me.

1719
02:04:46,536 --> 02:04:56,765
I also wanted to echo Rebecca Schmidtling's comment as well as a young person who's coming to our first meeting, who's a homeowner in this city, who's now a resident.

1720
02:04:56,785 --> 02:05:04,072
I just, I really was looking forward to participating for the first time in my government.

1721
02:05:05,214 --> 02:05:08,557
And I just have not really felt welcomed at all so far.

1722
02:05:10,225 --> 02:05:14,998
The divisiveness that I've seen tonight has been really disappointing to me and that I've seen over the last couple of days.

1723
02:05:17,212 --> 02:05:33,680
I also wanted to address Councillor Knight and just let him know, I heard that he said he has a technical issue in terms of enabling his video, which many people tonight have spoken from a disability standpoint, not being able to see the video is really challenging and to be able to read the voice, see the lips.

1724
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:36,761
I just wanted to let you know that the phone number to call in is 669-900-6833.

1725
02:05:40,963 --> 02:05:45,065
There's participant code is 175-8500.

1726
02:05:45,446 --> 02:05:47,467
You can call separately from a phone.

1727
02:05:48,167 --> 02:05:50,148
We'll also still be connected to the video.

1728
02:05:50,168 --> 02:05:53,910
So you were saying there was a technical issue earlier where you couldn't do both at the same time.

1729
02:05:53,950 --> 02:05:55,291
So I just wanted that to be known.

1730
02:05:55,311 --> 02:06:01,834
The other piece is I have an eight month old infant, as I mentioned, and I've been spending my whole day on Zoom.

1731
02:06:02,664 --> 02:06:27,735
Um and engaging in meetings and I don't I don't stop showing up despite how horrible it is how awful it is to be caring for a child who Literally fell on her face today while I was participating in a meeting and had a bloody nose And I only have a responsibility to my co-workers and I still show up because I feel that responsibility but you guys have a responsibility to the entire population in this city and for you to not show up is just

1732
02:06:28,495 --> 02:06:29,616
beyond disappointing.

1733
02:06:30,296 --> 02:06:31,517
I'm happy to have a discussion.

1734
02:06:31,577 --> 02:06:34,940
I'm a very friendly person, happy to chat about all the different issues.

1735
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:41,584
I would also like to know, I believe Councilor Scarpelli earlier brought up that he would fight for any of his constituents.

1736
02:06:41,624 --> 02:06:54,994
And I'm just wondering, in light of the advance notice that the meeting would be held over Zoom, besides protesting the meetings, what other actions were taken to fight to enable access for your constituents besides boycotting the meeting?

1737
02:07:09,357 --> 02:07:12,400
Okay, I'll take that as no response and no actions taken.

1738
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:12,881
Thank you.

1739
02:07:14,943 --> 02:07:15,623
Thank you, Jessie.

1740
02:07:17,105 --> 02:07:23,071
Let's see, we have Brendan Clune.

1741
02:07:24,272 --> 02:07:25,693
Name and address for the record, please.

1742
02:07:29,117 --> 02:07:29,717
Hi, can you hear me?

1743
02:07:30,078 --> 02:07:30,238
Yes.

1744
02:07:31,101 --> 02:07:31,542
Hi, thank you.

1745
02:07:31,562 --> 02:07:32,382
My name is Brendan Kloon.

1746
02:07:32,402 --> 02:07:36,907
I live at 79 Dexter Street in Medford, South Medford.

1747
02:07:37,408 --> 02:07:41,552
The points that I wanted to get to actually were already kind of touched upon by Rebecca and Jesse.

1748
02:07:41,592 --> 02:07:43,735
I thank you guys so much for speaking up, by the way.

1749
02:07:44,275 --> 02:07:51,783
Rebecca and Jesse, speaking up on the behalf of young people in Medford who are trying to get involved in the Medford political sphere, trying to get involved in

1750
02:07:53,937 --> 02:08:04,141
I'm getting to the bottom of the information that is very clearly been occluded and why we have not been able to have any of these meetings so far.

1751
02:08:04,201 --> 02:08:12,225
But in particular, I want to speak to something else about the language of the council members that's been bothering me tonight that I found kind of resentful.

1752
02:08:13,233 --> 02:08:23,884
And that is when they've been asked for the justifications, for the reasons why they haven't come to the meeting so far, why they just didn't show up.

1753
02:08:24,865 --> 02:08:36,497
Instead of clear, straightforward answers, like I've heard Councilor Morrell, like I've heard Councilor Behrs give about their rationale for taking the actions that they've had to over the last week, there has been

1754
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:59,108
Discussions at length, excuses made at length, not about the actual information done or said or provided here, but about their experience, their own personal lives, their own reasons why they don't like Zoom as a platform, them specifically.

1755
02:08:59,788 --> 02:09:03,812
not the people who they are trying to represent in our district.

1756
02:09:04,833 --> 02:09:06,554
I, you know, I'll keep this short and sweet.

1757
02:09:06,614 --> 02:09:07,815
I just find that resentful.

1758
02:09:07,835 --> 02:09:11,378
I find that incredibly distasteful.

1759
02:09:11,498 --> 02:09:14,601
I think that that is a way to deflect from

1760
02:09:15,702 --> 02:09:24,645
the questions that were asked, I think that that is a way for them to not really give their full rationale or to just give no rationale whatsoever.

1761
02:09:24,665 --> 02:09:31,848
And they're speaking to their experience in their positions, I can speak to my experience in response to that.

1762
02:09:32,408 --> 02:09:35,709
I am an environmental health and safety and building science consultant.

1763
02:09:36,189 --> 02:09:46,733
If I was asked a question, why a certain situation in a building that I went into or in a hospital that I went into was the way it was, what action should be taken?

1764
02:09:47,033 --> 02:09:55,336
If I went on at length about myself, my own experience, but not actually give any actual answers, I wouldn't have a job anymore.

1765
02:09:55,716 --> 02:09:59,578
I think a lot of other people have spoken from a similar perspective from

1766
02:10:00,758 --> 02:10:01,678
their own positions.

1767
02:10:02,258 --> 02:10:13,121
So I just want that to be stated for the record that I want, and I'm so glad that other people spoke up as well, because I thought I was the only one that was becoming frustrated with that.

1768
02:10:13,161 --> 02:10:14,001
And it turns out I'm not.

1769
02:10:14,021 --> 02:10:18,282
It seems a lot of young people in particular are also very frustrated by that.

1770
02:10:18,962 --> 02:10:29,605
So I would like, on the part of all the council members involved in tonight's discussion, but in particular the council members who have gone on at length about themselves,

1771
02:10:30,785 --> 02:10:48,349
to give shorter and concise answers about why they have not have or have not shown up, why they have or have not opposed certain items, and stop involving themselves and their own in all of that.

1772
02:10:48,829 --> 02:10:49,129
Thank you.

1773
02:10:49,809 --> 02:10:50,189
Thank you.

1774
02:10:50,209 --> 02:10:56,870
Okay, we have Courtney Lynch.

1775
02:10:58,051 --> 02:11:00,071
Name and address for the record, Courtney, please.

1776
02:11:01,155 --> 02:11:02,616
Hi, my name is Courtney Lynch.

1777
02:11:02,796 --> 02:11:05,197
I'm from 69 Clulee Road in West Medford.

1778
02:11:06,558 --> 02:11:16,103
I think I want to start with kind of putting up the reason why there are so many people here in comparison to past council and budget meetings.

1779
02:11:17,444 --> 02:11:18,864
We can't ignore that

1780
02:11:20,165 --> 02:11:27,568
the budget of the city is systematically connected to all of the things that are going on within this current world.

1781
02:11:28,588 --> 02:11:34,670
COVID, of course, but directly connected to our police and our education.

1782
02:11:34,790 --> 02:11:39,412
And those are two buzzing things going on right now that need to be addressed.

1783
02:11:39,912 --> 02:11:41,172
I think the idea that

1784
02:11:43,143 --> 02:11:49,247
some context behind why people are upset at the floor councilman for not showing up.

1785
02:11:49,908 --> 02:12:05,019
And it's not a personal thing, but it's just the fact that because this budget is so incredibly important in order to help, you know, help lessen the violence against marginalized communities and people of color and students of color in this city.

1786
02:12:06,472 --> 02:12:12,799
is by them not showing up to a budget meeting that inherently affects these communities.

1787
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:18,845
I'm not saying that that was their intent, but it can, to the public, look that way.

1788
02:12:18,865 --> 02:12:22,869
At least to me and a lot of the youth of Medford have felt that way.

1789
02:12:22,889 --> 02:12:25,271
I also just want to say,

1790
02:12:26,112 --> 02:12:52,452
The idea some language has been brought up that um medford like was once like everyone was happy and everyone was um, like, you know, everything was equal and we were all good like everything just because that there wasn't any pushback towards Any of these counselors in the past and once again, this isn't personal if councillor bears or council morrell or president falco didn't show up

1791
02:12:53,228 --> 02:13:00,612
I think we should equally be upset at that, because if you're a person in a public position, you're a public servant.

1792
02:13:01,392 --> 02:13:05,675
You are subject to comments and to critiques.

1793
02:13:06,015 --> 02:13:14,880
And I just think it's just interesting seeing how upset and angry people are getting back.

1794
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:22,864
Some of these council men are getting at not only other council members on the council, but the public that are

1795
02:13:23,324 --> 02:13:26,867
critiquing them when that's one of the things of the job.

1796
02:13:28,168 --> 02:13:37,876
I just kind of, yeah, I just, I think we can't ignore the systematic and intersection of everything that's going on and why people are upset.

1797
02:13:37,976 --> 02:13:38,537
That's all I have to say.

1798
02:13:39,718 --> 02:13:40,398
Thank you, Courtney.

1799
02:13:40,959 --> 02:13:42,060
Let's see, Natalie Hill.

1800
02:13:42,868 --> 02:13:44,230
name and address for the record, please.

1801
02:13:44,711 --> 02:13:45,973
Hello, I'm Natalie Hill.

1802
02:13:46,353 --> 02:13:52,423
I live at 15 Madison Street, Medford, Mass.

1803
02:13:52,583 --> 02:13:58,012
I just wanted to echo, I think it was Marshall or Alejandra maybe stated that

1804
02:13:58,932 --> 02:14:05,136
I think approximately there was a lot of pushback around the fact that the budget hadn't been submitted.

1805
02:14:05,156 --> 02:14:08,078
And I just wanted to echo that.

1806
02:14:08,718 --> 02:14:10,559
That sentiment was clearly stated.

1807
02:14:10,579 --> 02:14:17,503
It was a point of tension and minimizing it at this point seems a bit silly.

1808
02:14:17,523 --> 02:14:20,545
So I just wanted to put that on record.

1809
02:14:21,565 --> 02:14:21,925
Thank you.

1810
02:14:23,266 --> 02:14:26,288
Let's see, we have, I believe it's Erin Farra.

1811
02:14:30,371 --> 02:14:33,472
Hi, my name's Antonia.

1812
02:14:33,813 --> 02:14:34,813
I'm seven.

1813
02:14:36,014 --> 02:14:36,934
I'm Erin Farah.

1814
02:14:37,014 --> 02:14:37,975
I'm her mom.

1815
02:14:38,935 --> 02:14:40,836
I've lived at 140 Austin Street.

1816
02:14:40,916 --> 02:14:42,977
My family moved there 30 years ago.

1817
02:14:42,997 --> 02:14:45,778
And my daughter wanted to speak first.

1818
02:14:46,038 --> 02:14:47,479
Her name is Antonia Farah Stein.

1819
02:14:47,499 --> 02:14:47,539
Hi.

1820
02:14:51,177 --> 02:15:03,761
I have heard a lot of people speaking, and I've also heard a lot of people saying that they want to see people eye to eye.

1821
02:15:04,182 --> 02:15:10,824
And I just wanted to say that I can see everybody eye to eye right now.

1822
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:19,127
I don't know if anybody has problems with their computer or phone or whatever they're using for Zoom.

1823
02:15:21,108 --> 02:15:24,735
And if people are like tired of Zoom, I just...

1824
02:15:28,093 --> 02:15:35,660
I have been doing Zoom a lot for my school and for other events.

1825
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:37,021
Since February.

1826
02:15:37,321 --> 02:15:38,202
Since February.

1827
02:15:38,462 --> 02:15:42,646
I've had to do one today for a cooking class.

1828
02:15:43,066 --> 02:15:53,235
And you don't have to be looking at, and sometimes you don't have to be looking at the screen all the time, like in my cooking class, I just had to be focused on the food.

1829
02:15:55,096 --> 02:16:06,505
But but she's shown up every single time To her school and if she doesn't show up to her school, there's consequences And if I don't show up to my job, there's consequences and Tony.

1830
02:16:06,545 --> 02:16:07,526
Did you want to continue to speak?

1831
02:16:07,726 --> 02:16:08,406
Yes I

1832
02:16:13,865 --> 02:16:22,431
I came into this meeting thinking that we were going to be talking about the budget.

1833
02:16:23,091 --> 02:16:27,154
But all that I've heard is a lot of argumenting.

1834
02:16:27,174 --> 02:16:35,660
And I just wanted to say that I wasn't very happy with what I saw.

1835
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:41,444
I've been here for a while because I've been very engaged with what's happening.

1836
02:16:43,705 --> 02:16:45,609
And I did.

1837
02:16:45,629 --> 02:16:45,749
I have.

1838
02:16:52,350 --> 02:16:56,193
heart liked what I've heard a little, but, um, not a lot.

1839
02:16:56,533 --> 02:17:13,305
And, um, I was, um, looking for what people left and I noticed that, um, the vice president left and I, and that is what made me feel, feel really, um, frustrated and mad.

1840
02:17:14,446 --> 02:17:17,628
So if I may just, uh, first of all, thank you very much for your comments.

1841
02:17:17,668 --> 02:17:18,249
Great job.

1842
02:17:19,543 --> 02:17:20,103
fabulous.

1843
02:17:21,764 --> 02:17:22,685
You're a great speaker.

1844
02:17:23,726 --> 02:17:24,106
Thanks.

1845
02:17:25,307 --> 02:17:27,048
What did you make fun of today?

1846
02:17:29,490 --> 02:17:30,011
I'm sorry.

1847
02:17:30,231 --> 02:17:31,011
If I may add.

1848
02:17:32,112 --> 02:17:33,994
If I may just, one second.

1849
02:17:34,114 --> 02:17:39,838
I just wanted to mention that Councilor Carviello is not on camera, but he's on my phone.

1850
02:17:40,158 --> 02:17:41,640
So I just wanted to mention that.

1851
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:42,580
Okay.

1852
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:43,601
Thank you.

1853
02:17:43,721 --> 02:17:44,021
Sorry.

1854
02:17:44,142 --> 02:17:44,462
Thank you.

1855
02:17:46,105 --> 02:18:03,896
So as someone who moved to Medford at age 12, about 30 years ago, I'm here to say that it has not been a happy and unified place in my existence, and has been full of racism and division.

1856
02:18:04,696 --> 02:18:21,786
unfortunately, um, I think that it's No coincidence that as people have been coming together after the death of george floyd and um that people have unified um, uh people of color and their allies That suddenly four people don't show up.

1857
02:18:22,666 --> 02:18:31,051
Um, and we're talking a lot about zoom and one person on who just doesn't who wants to be there in person meanwhile 251 people are on a zoom call

1858
02:18:33,831 --> 02:18:36,435
And as a healthcare professional, it's not safe.

1859
02:18:36,495 --> 02:18:39,279
I know you're gonna call for an intercession, but I'd like to finish, please.

1860
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:42,444
So I know that's been said a few times.

1861
02:18:46,958 --> 02:18:49,020
The one person is a figure of speech.

1862
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:51,001
It was many people.

1863
02:18:51,041 --> 02:18:51,982
So just make that clear.

1864
02:18:52,262 --> 02:18:56,925
I apologize if I'm confusing anybody, but this is one is just a figure of speech.

1865
02:18:57,666 --> 02:18:57,986
Okay.

1866
02:18:58,066 --> 02:18:59,067
It's a figure of speech.

1867
02:18:59,107 --> 02:19:07,893
However, you have many people on this call talking about how, um, if it was a hybrid meeting, they would not be able to understand because you'd have to wear a mask.

1868
02:19:08,433 --> 02:19:10,255
And so they would not be included.

1869
02:19:11,115 --> 02:19:26,400
You have people who are talking about how their family members of kovat and they are not allowed to go out of their home So they would not be included so we can count all of those people all of those people would not be included so we should go on the record counting each and every one of those people because they all count as well and

1870
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:52,522
And we're all talking about this hybrid zoom which I think is a bit of a red herring Because I don't think that's the real issue here I think the real issue here is that everyone is watching and suddenly everyone is interested and everyone wants to be a part of this and that is scary for people who do not want that and want these these meetings to be not as open and as inclusive as the rest of us

1871
02:19:52,882 --> 02:19:55,363
Do want them to be so I think medford is changing.

1872
02:19:55,603 --> 02:20:00,164
I don't think everyone wants it to change And I think we're all here to help it change.

1873
02:20:00,404 --> 02:20:01,484
So that's what i'd like to say.

1874
02:20:01,705 --> 02:20:02,065
Thank you.

1875
02:20:02,565 --> 02:20:16,289
Thank you Let's see we okay, um Sam donahue name and address of the record, please Hi, rachel wolfe from 582 fulton.

1876
02:20:16,369 --> 02:20:20,470
I wanted to circle back to what brock walsh had said about um

1877
02:20:22,423 --> 02:20:36,112
The e-mails from Mary Ann O'Connor, the director of public health for Medford, because we had sort of tabled that as we look into those e-mails, but it was my understanding that the councilman thought that her e-mail was ambiguous.

1878
02:20:37,253 --> 02:20:44,175
President Falco, you were kind to share her emails in a screenshot with a member of the community, and I have it here, and I'd like to state it for the record.

1879
02:20:44,235 --> 02:20:46,756
She said, these should be remotely held.

1880
02:20:47,276 --> 02:20:52,837
In-person meetings absolutely defeats what we are trying to promote to the public and makes us look hypocritical.

1881
02:20:53,217 --> 02:20:54,938
The pandemic is still real.

1882
02:20:55,358 --> 02:20:59,439
We cannot and should not send conflicting messages as public officials.

1883
02:20:59,699 --> 02:21:03,420
Mary Ann, is there anything ambiguous about that to you, Councilman?

1884
02:21:07,656 --> 02:21:08,156
Councilor Knight.

1885
02:21:08,777 --> 02:21:13,299
The question that I asked her was whether or not the public body could meet and deliberate in person.

1886
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:21,763
Not whether or not the council chambers would be open to the public, not whether or not public participation would be available.

1887
02:21:22,143 --> 02:21:29,107
The question that I asked her was whether or not, pursuant to the governor's executive order, there were any restrictions on the government body meeting in person.

1888
02:21:31,536 --> 02:21:34,198
That answer that she gave versus the question that were asked are a little different.

1889
02:21:34,818 --> 02:21:40,503
Um, I've been able to secure a copy of the email that, uh, Mr. Walsh spoke of, and I have already forwarded it.

1890
02:21:40,543 --> 02:21:44,026
I do believe to the city clerk's attention, um, for distribution.

1891
02:21:44,326 --> 02:21:46,968
Um, it's a little likely I'm not going to go through the time of reading it right now.

1892
02:21:47,809 --> 02:21:50,111
Um, but you know, I do want to make that very clear.

1893
02:21:50,891 --> 02:21:56,616
That, um, my question was, is there a restriction on the council meeting in the council chambers and doing these budget hearings in person?

1894
02:21:57,413 --> 02:21:58,134
That was the first thing.

1895
02:21:58,194 --> 02:21:59,575
If there is, then we can't do it.

1896
02:21:59,695 --> 02:22:01,096
Then Zoom is the only alternative.

1897
02:22:01,576 --> 02:22:04,839
If there's no restriction, then we can meet in person.

1898
02:22:05,099 --> 02:22:10,984
My understanding of the email, her direct quote is, in-person meetings absolutely defeats what we are trying to promote.

1899
02:22:11,044 --> 02:22:15,008
So it sounds as if she's lumping in all in-person meetings.

1900
02:22:15,788 --> 02:22:33,943
That was the ambiguity that I had with it was there was a talk about public participation in the like as well involved in some of that email chain I do believe where it will be open to the general public to come and participate at the meeting in a physical setting, and we know that's not allowed because city halls closed.

1901
02:22:34,754 --> 02:22:38,416
to the general public, but it's open to city employees.

1902
02:22:39,037 --> 02:22:42,298
And the members of the Memphis City Council are, in fact, city employees.

1903
02:22:42,318 --> 02:22:43,599
So City Hall is open to us.

1904
02:22:44,139 --> 02:22:52,144
Now, where we're a government body and we're exempt from the governor's executive order, then the question is, can we meet?

1905
02:22:52,764 --> 02:22:56,487
And if we can meet, can we do it safely and in a setting where we're all in the same room?

1906
02:22:56,787 --> 02:22:58,708
I mean, that's the question that was being asked.

1907
02:22:58,748 --> 02:22:59,188
You know what I mean?

1908
02:22:59,208 --> 02:23:00,749
It seems like you're splitting hairs to me.

1909
02:23:00,789 --> 02:23:02,150
Her email is pretty clear.

1910
02:23:02,745 --> 02:23:03,505
That's fine.

1911
02:23:03,705 --> 02:23:04,166
That's fine.

1912
02:23:04,186 --> 02:23:04,686
You know what I mean?

1913
02:23:04,726 --> 02:23:06,747
If you feel that way, that's your prerogative.

1914
02:23:06,787 --> 02:23:12,129
And I can't change the way you feel, just like you can't change the way I feel when I took a stand for something I believed in.

1915
02:23:12,489 --> 02:23:14,950
We are at an impasse, Councilor Knight.

1916
02:23:15,588 --> 02:23:16,949
That's okay, you know what I mean?

1917
02:23:16,969 --> 02:23:18,029
And we can agree to move on.

1918
02:23:18,069 --> 02:23:22,312
I think we have a game plan here for us to address some of these concerns and go forward.

1919
02:23:22,672 --> 02:23:40,982
Well, I hope your game plan includes listening to what the public health officials are saying, because I really hope I'm not inundated at my job in the hospital with sick people, because you would like to look somebody in the eye when, as our seven-year-old member of the community stated really eloquently, we can see you all eye to eye right now.

1920
02:23:41,082 --> 02:23:44,644
And I will put my video on so that you can see my hazel eyes.

1921
02:23:45,649 --> 02:23:48,010
And they're beautiful, let me tell you.

1922
02:23:48,050 --> 02:23:53,873
But something is to be said when you have the people in the same room working together.

1923
02:23:55,094 --> 02:23:59,436
I feel as though- But not when there's a deadly disease going on.

1924
02:24:00,036 --> 02:24:02,177
Granted, there are safety protocols that need to be taken.

1925
02:24:02,217 --> 02:24:06,039
There is a criteria and guideline that's been published.

1926
02:24:06,719 --> 02:24:08,880
If people are going back to work, why aren't we?

1927
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:09,740
That's all I'm saying.

1928
02:24:10,181 --> 02:24:14,963
If people are going back to work and getting phased in to go back to work, then the city council shouldn't be exempt.

1929
02:24:15,778 --> 02:24:17,219
We should be going back to work too.

1930
02:24:17,859 --> 02:24:21,680
Time out, time out, time out.

1931
02:24:21,921 --> 02:24:24,041
Let me finish.

1932
02:24:24,101 --> 02:24:31,924
And if we look at the governing rules of the city council, the criteria, the Memphis City Council shall meet in the council chambers.

1933
02:24:32,185 --> 02:24:33,125
That's what the rules say.

1934
02:24:33,545 --> 02:24:34,286
You know what I mean?

1935
02:24:34,326 --> 02:24:36,127
So, I'm not trying to split hairs here.

1936
02:24:36,367 --> 02:24:38,549
You know, what I'm saying is that I prefer it there.

1937
02:24:38,769 --> 02:24:41,011
I took an oath to do this job to the best of my ability.

1938
02:24:41,071 --> 02:24:43,333
I know I do it better when I'm working with people in person.

1939
02:24:44,033 --> 02:24:53,341
There are mitigating factors and circumstances, and we've come up with a proposal that I think will appease all the needs of everybody that's having conflicting viewpoints on this.

1940
02:24:53,841 --> 02:24:57,984
Come tomorrow at 7 o'clock at night, this issue is going to be over.

1941
02:24:58,345 --> 02:25:00,146
We're either going to have a new game plan or we're not.

1942
02:25:00,927 --> 02:25:02,348
And, you have a commitment.

1943
02:25:02,923 --> 02:25:13,051
from the four counselors who have had concern about this to say, if, in fact, this body that we've talked about can't get together and come up with a solution, then all right.

1944
02:25:13,211 --> 02:25:13,852
Game over.

1945
02:25:14,452 --> 02:25:14,933
You win.

1946
02:25:15,273 --> 02:25:16,134
We're going to move on.

1947
02:25:16,574 --> 02:25:26,082
We'll be bound by the determination of the vice president, the council president, the health professional, the community media professional, and the administration.

1948
02:25:26,402 --> 02:25:31,326
This time tomorrow, this issue is going to be over, and we're going to have a schedule.

1949
02:25:32,755 --> 02:25:41,006
I hope that whatever you decide on tomorrow listens to what public health officials are saying quite clearly without any ambiguity.

1950
02:25:41,026 --> 02:25:44,271
And I hope that they're also not dependent on, you know,

1951
02:25:45,698 --> 02:25:55,344
You being in the police union's pocket because it sort of feels like the police unions issued a public statement today supporting you Mr. President, we're an information console box.

1952
02:25:55,924 --> 02:26:01,328
We like I said, I just want to make sure that also, Mr. President, there are people that have been waiting to speak.

1953
02:26:02,248 --> 02:26:04,049
And we have people that have spoken twice.

1954
02:26:05,850 --> 02:26:08,292
Everyone gets a fair chance to speak Mr. President.

1955
02:26:08,412 --> 02:26:09,753
You are correct and I'm trying my best.

1956
02:26:09,793 --> 02:26:16,418
I believe I believe you're the first one to speak twice I and I know people are going to be here for a second time that haven't spoke yet.

1957
02:26:16,458 --> 02:26:24,024
Mr I'm trying my best to get to everyone to make sure that you know, they they speak I want everybody to speak at least once before we go to another round.

1958
02:26:24,104 --> 02:26:27,667
So I'm trying my best interesting that you cut me off when I was

1959
02:26:28,347 --> 02:26:29,588
bringing up the police unions.

1960
02:26:29,808 --> 02:26:30,648
Oh, interesting.

1961
02:26:30,809 --> 02:26:31,909
What a conspiracy.

1962
02:26:32,189 --> 02:26:33,170
What a conspiracy.

1963
02:26:33,550 --> 02:26:34,571
Please.

1964
02:26:35,031 --> 02:26:36,012
I'm glad you agree.

1965
02:26:36,272 --> 02:26:37,253
What a conspiracy.

1966
02:26:37,373 --> 02:26:37,733
Correct.

1967
02:26:37,913 --> 02:26:39,334
Oh, what have we got here?

1968
02:26:40,074 --> 02:26:40,474
All right.

1969
02:26:40,495 --> 02:26:46,818
So you'll get your personal privilege, Mr. President, personal privilege.

1970
02:26:46,938 --> 02:26:54,103
You know, as I explained previously in the meeting, there was no nefarious intentions, no nefarious goals.

1971
02:26:54,543 --> 02:26:56,704
You know, what we wanted to do was open it up.

1972
02:26:56,944 --> 02:27:01,585
There was a concern that was brought to me, and I felt as though it was inappropriate.

1973
02:27:02,125 --> 02:27:03,506
I took a stand on that matter.

1974
02:27:03,826 --> 02:27:04,986
I'm not in anybody's pocket.

1975
02:27:05,486 --> 02:27:06,626
All right, I don't want to hear that.

1976
02:27:07,227 --> 02:27:09,027
Let me finish.

1977
02:27:09,047 --> 02:27:11,228
You had your opportunity that I don't appreciate.

1978
02:27:15,829 --> 02:27:26,058
Now, you have the right to say what you want to say and you have the right to your opinion, but what I'm not going to stand for as a public employee is to sit here and have my character and reputation tarnished and criticized, okay?

1979
02:27:26,418 --> 02:27:31,963
So, ultimately, I came out and I told you guys where I was coming from and I said why I did what I did.

1980
02:27:32,383 --> 02:27:34,865
That might not be good enough for you, but that's where it is.

1981
02:27:34,945 --> 02:27:36,427
That's where I'm coming from.

1982
02:27:36,487 --> 02:27:37,948
That's all that it was.

1983
02:27:38,008 --> 02:27:40,230
There's no more and no less, alright?

1984
02:27:40,250 --> 02:27:41,251
The council took a vote.

1985
02:27:42,608 --> 02:27:44,350
to see if we could have the meetings in person.

1986
02:27:44,690 --> 02:27:50,255
It never came back around to a point that met the majority of the council's satisfaction.

1987
02:27:51,656 --> 02:27:53,518
A stand was taken.

1988
02:27:53,978 --> 02:27:58,442
We've been able to get past this stand, and now we're looking to move forward.

1989
02:27:59,983 --> 02:28:06,369
I don't think that it's conducive to moving forward if we're going to make accusations like that, quite frankly.

1990
02:28:07,930 --> 02:28:13,077
big personal umbrage to it because I feel as though you're attacking my character and you're attacking my reputation.

1991
02:28:13,718 --> 02:28:16,983
I know that that's probably not your intention because emotions are running high.

1992
02:28:18,155 --> 02:28:22,836
And this is an issue that people are very passionate about and I can appreciate that and I can accept it.

1993
02:28:23,556 --> 02:28:34,039
However, Mr. President, I think that, you know, as the meeting goes forward, you know, every councilor that has taken a stand on the issue has explained what their intent was and it was not nefarious.

1994
02:28:34,479 --> 02:28:47,742
And to say that it is, is, you know, concerning to me, you know, I'm a big boy, you know, I know what I signed up for when I ran for elected office and when I chose to live a public life and I can take people throwing rocks at me and I can take the heat and I can take the stones.

1995
02:28:48,082 --> 02:28:49,223
You know, that's not a problem.

1996
02:28:49,543 --> 02:28:57,069
But I just don't think if you're going to attack my character and call into question my motivations when I've already explained myself, that that's proper.

1997
02:28:57,169 --> 02:28:59,251
Now, you know, I know it's not Miss Donahue.

1998
02:28:59,291 --> 02:29:00,792
I know that that's a miss walk.

1999
02:29:04,328 --> 02:29:05,589
I can appreciate where you're coming from.

2000
02:29:05,649 --> 02:29:10,971
I really can, um, you know, and I thank you for your comments and I thank you for your passion and for your involvement.

2001
02:29:11,391 --> 02:29:17,453
But, you know, as I stated before, there's no, I wasn't trying to run down the city hall with pitchforks and light the place on fire.

2002
02:29:17,774 --> 02:29:21,335
You know, I was trying to create a process that worked better for people that express concern.

2003
02:29:22,087 --> 02:29:30,714
And I'm sorry if that's not getting through or if the narrative is getting lost in translation, but this isn't, you know, some police unions got me in the pocket.

2004
02:29:31,054 --> 02:29:36,499
And you know, we're not going to be able to be heard because quite frankly the budget hearings have to happen before we vote on the budget.

2005
02:29:36,759 --> 02:29:38,320
Thank you for your response.

2006
02:29:44,757 --> 02:29:53,522
So if I may set the record straight, you know, originally we set up with this, you know, the original plan was to develop a safety plan in a non-virtual setting.

2007
02:29:54,022 --> 02:29:59,826
And just to reiterate, you know, what I did is when I reached out to Mary Ann O'Connor, the director of public health,

2008
02:30:00,612 --> 02:30:03,693
She said no, thinking that the general public was going to be in.

2009
02:30:04,413 --> 02:30:07,254
And I said, and then I explained to her, it's just going to be the councilors.

2010
02:30:07,394 --> 02:30:08,455
And she still said no.

2011
02:30:08,655 --> 02:30:14,817
So I just want to reiterate that, that she was not, you know, at no point in time did she want really anyone to meet.

2012
02:30:15,377 --> 02:30:17,898
And for me, that was the, I stopped at that point.

2013
02:30:17,938 --> 02:30:18,978
I said, it's going to be Zoom.

2014
02:30:19,018 --> 02:30:20,279
So I just want to clarify that.

2015
02:30:20,299 --> 02:30:21,459
I know there's a lot going around.

2016
02:30:21,939 --> 02:30:23,120
I wanted to clarify that.

2017
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:29,042
Councilor Falco, if I may, you know, I'm absolutely positively willing to say that

2018
02:30:29,718 --> 02:30:33,240
There was a breakdown in communication, and we could have done a better job as a council on this.

2019
02:30:33,661 --> 02:30:35,302
No doubt in my mind, you know what I mean?

2020
02:30:35,342 --> 02:30:36,983
There was a breakdown in communication on this.

2021
02:30:37,764 --> 02:30:39,445
Part of that has to do with the setting of the meetings.

2022
02:30:40,185 --> 02:30:48,911
But again, I'm bound by whatever it is that this group of people that we've decided can go forward and talk about this comes up with.

2023
02:30:48,991 --> 02:30:49,712
I'm bound by that.

2024
02:30:49,772 --> 02:30:51,333
I've already put my – I've already said that.

2025
02:30:51,353 --> 02:30:52,474
I've given my word to that.

2026
02:30:53,354 --> 02:30:57,057
You know, so I think that, you know, our intents are our intents.

2027
02:30:59,070 --> 02:31:01,032
stated out loud in public.

2028
02:31:01,352 --> 02:31:02,713
It wasn't nefarious.

2029
02:31:03,274 --> 02:31:04,355
There was no malintent.

2030
02:31:04,655 --> 02:31:11,421
There was no ill will towards the process, towards our colleagues, or towards anything.

2031
02:31:11,461 --> 02:31:14,764
It was making sure that we did it right and making sure that the people that had concerns

2032
02:31:15,435 --> 02:31:17,997
Will listen to and people have concerns right now.

2033
02:31:18,037 --> 02:31:19,118
I'm listening to you as well.

2034
02:31:19,179 --> 02:31:28,527
And I I I thank you for that But I think when we're starting to go attack the character of the council is after they've already explained their position and why they did what they did Um is going down a slippery slope with the president.

2035
02:31:28,547 --> 02:31:33,051
I'd ask that you reel it in a little bit I want to make sure we get those stories straight.

2036
02:31:33,091 --> 02:31:34,793
That's all let's see brendan.

2037
02:31:34,853 --> 02:31:36,875
Shea name and address for the record

2038
02:31:39,817 --> 02:31:40,358
Hi, yes.

2039
02:31:41,919 --> 02:31:47,545
Yeah, my name is Brendan Shay address 139 Century Street extension Medford.

2040
02:31:48,345 --> 02:31:57,134
I've lived in Medford for 18 years so I don't know if that makes me a newcomer or where the threshold is for that.

2041
02:32:01,667 --> 02:32:11,391
I really wanted to hold up some of the things that Rebecca and Marlee and Abdias had said earlier about the...

2042
02:32:16,871 --> 02:32:24,977
The way that I feel like people have been dismissed and their concerns have been dismissed in this discussion.

2043
02:32:25,558 --> 02:32:32,744
I've been to city council meeting before, but this is the first one on Zoom, and this is the first one with this council.

2044
02:32:33,844 --> 02:32:38,208
And really, frankly, it's been really eye-opening for me, I have to say.

2045
02:32:40,968 --> 02:32:50,484
you know, like Rebecca had said, there's been a lot that's been talked about, about the number of years of experience that people have had in doing budgets.

2046
02:32:50,765 --> 02:32:53,209
And, you know, I value everyone's experience.

2047
02:32:53,269 --> 02:32:53,669
However,

2048
02:32:55,217 --> 02:32:57,778
I care about what people do now in this moment.

2049
02:32:58,099 --> 02:33:09,464
This moment is so important right now with what's going on in the world with COVID, with what's going on in the world with Black Lives Matter and marginalized people.

2050
02:33:10,585 --> 02:33:21,511
And I frankly don't care about, you know, people saying we have seniority or it's really important that people's voices be heard.

2051
02:33:25,221 --> 02:33:37,085
I also want to echo what people have said about, I feel like there's an avoidance here of talking about what the core issue is, which is, what are the values that we have?

2052
02:33:37,185 --> 02:33:40,967
Our budget is a reflection of our values as a community.

2053
02:33:41,067 --> 02:33:42,787
That's what's important right now.

2054
02:33:42,867 --> 02:33:49,170
That's what we should be talking about, not technicalities, not putting people down,

2055
02:33:51,816 --> 02:33:54,058
Yeah, this is, it's been eye-opening.

2056
02:33:55,339 --> 02:33:56,921
I feel like I'm a much more informed voter.

2057
02:33:57,661 --> 02:33:59,943
So yeah, thank you, thank you again.

2058
02:34:00,223 --> 02:34:03,326
And thank you, Councilor Falco.

2059
02:34:03,346 --> 02:34:07,389
It's a very challenging job to organize everything here.

2060
02:34:07,449 --> 02:34:08,870
So thank you for everything that you're doing.

2061
02:34:09,331 --> 02:34:10,491
Brenda, thank you very much.

2062
02:34:10,572 --> 02:34:14,515
I try my best, but I appreciate your kind words.

2063
02:34:14,575 --> 02:34:14,935
Thank you.

2064
02:34:15,796 --> 02:34:16,416
Let's see here.

2065
02:34:18,877 --> 02:34:21,198
trying hard to call people that have not been called yet.

2066
02:34:21,278 --> 02:34:24,940
So I just wanna make sure everybody has the opportunity to speak.

2067
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:29,122
Let's see, Sophie Ricks, I don't believe you've spoken yet.

2068
02:34:29,522 --> 02:34:31,643
If you could please have your name and address for the record.

2069
02:34:36,125 --> 02:34:37,846
Yes, can you hear me?

2070
02:34:38,266 --> 02:34:38,486
Yes.

2071
02:34:39,687 --> 02:34:41,888
It's Sophie Ricks, 78 Cotting Street.

2072
02:34:44,330 --> 02:34:51,373
I just want to echo a lot of what other people were saying about the lack of a statement from the four counselors.

2073
02:34:51,713 --> 02:34:58,496
I understand that tonight they're trying to make statements, but I'm still confused as to why there wasn't a statement.

2074
02:34:59,237 --> 02:35:00,017
Sorry, I'm out of breath.

2075
02:35:00,717 --> 02:35:01,258
I'm pregnant.

2076
02:35:01,738 --> 02:35:05,600
I sent a letter to all four counselors on Saturday.

2077
02:35:06,180 --> 02:35:07,841
I didn't hear anything back from any of them.

2078
02:35:09,061 --> 02:35:10,802
I sent them another email earlier today.

2079
02:35:11,862 --> 02:35:12,862
didn't hear a word back.

2080
02:35:14,263 --> 02:35:25,425
I do see things posted on social media that they are responding to some people and I'm confused as to if they have the time to respond to one person, why not just put out a statement to everybody?

2081
02:35:26,165 --> 02:35:28,966
So it does feel like they're sort of picking and choosing.

2082
02:35:30,086 --> 02:35:36,467
I still don't have a clear sense why they couldn't show up on Saturday morning or in the last few days to explain that.

2083
02:35:37,828 --> 02:35:39,028
I wanna add a few other things.

2084
02:35:40,434 --> 02:35:41,555
My father is 86.

2085
02:35:42,175 --> 02:35:43,156
He teaches at BU.

2086
02:35:43,977 --> 02:35:47,580
He was able to learn Zoom in like a day in order to teach.

2087
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:51,603
And he does that successfully multiple times a week.

2088
02:35:51,643 --> 02:35:52,984
He's been teaching on Zoom.

2089
02:35:54,365 --> 02:35:55,606
I use Zoom for telehealth.

2090
02:35:56,067 --> 02:35:58,929
I appreciate the voices of other people who work in healthcare.

2091
02:36:00,831 --> 02:36:07,596
I also wanted to come back to the analogy that Councilor Scarpelli offered about if you were a teacher to Elisa,

2092
02:36:08,987 --> 02:36:11,008
if you had one student who something wasn't working for.

2093
02:36:12,128 --> 02:36:23,414
And I think the analogy wasn't actually complete because the analogy would be, if you had one student who at the beginning of this pandemic said, online teaching really isn't working for me, can you come into the school?

2094
02:36:24,074 --> 02:36:28,276
I really need to sit down with you face to face in a small office to work on my long division.

2095
02:36:28,936 --> 02:36:33,178
You would say, I'm sorry, I have to be, you know, choosing public health over this.

2096
02:36:33,818 --> 02:36:36,479
Your long division skills might suffer right now.

2097
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:37,660
As a therapist,

2098
02:36:38,278 --> 02:36:40,659
This is something, I'm a therapist, I'm a social worker.

2099
02:36:41,519 --> 02:36:45,520
I'm in a lot of private practice and therapy online groups.

2100
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:51,562
And I see people saying, you know, a lot of my clients want to come back for face-to-face sessions, sort of, what should I do?

2101
02:36:52,282 --> 02:36:54,923
And the response is, we need to be the responsible ones.

2102
02:36:55,103 --> 02:36:57,884
We need to be the professionals who say, I would love that too.

2103
02:36:57,984 --> 02:37:01,145
I get that Zoom isn't great, but that's the better option right now.

2104
02:37:01,185 --> 02:37:02,145
That's the safe option.

2105
02:37:02,605 --> 02:37:05,166
Just because someone wants to do it doesn't mean it's the best thing for them.

2106
02:37:05,892 --> 02:37:09,695
And the city councilors need to be the people who are the adults in the room saying, you know what?

2107
02:37:09,755 --> 02:37:11,135
Yes, we're listening to the board of health.

2108
02:37:11,456 --> 02:37:16,179
We're listening to the people who are the professionals, not just because someone is willing to risk their own life.

2109
02:37:16,659 --> 02:37:28,507
It's not about, I heard someone earlier say something like, this is America and you don't get to decide for other people when it's a pandemic and you're going to affect other people when you're going to be the person ending up in the hospital who's infecting those healthcare workers.

2110
02:37:29,230 --> 02:37:32,211
Yeah, actually, your responsibility is to more than just yourself.

2111
02:37:32,351 --> 02:37:38,234
This isn't about whether you decide you want to wear a bike helmet when you're going for a bike ride, because that's only going to impact you.

2112
02:37:40,194 --> 02:37:51,599
So, you know, the analogy I have for being a therapist is I would also say to clients, you know, if they want to meet in face to face for therapy, unfortunately, this isn't a good idea.

2113
02:37:51,639 --> 02:37:56,181
If we can do a risk assessment for suicidality over Zoom, I think you can hold a budget meeting.

2114
02:37:56,481 --> 02:37:57,061
It doesn't seem

2115
02:37:57,803 --> 02:37:58,664
that challenging.

2116
02:37:58,844 --> 02:38:00,646
I echo what the seven-year-old said.

2117
02:38:00,666 --> 02:38:01,867
I think it was Antonia.

2118
02:38:02,047 --> 02:38:05,050
Antonia, I can see all of you guys perfectly.

2119
02:38:05,070 --> 02:38:07,553
I don't have any technological issues right now.

2120
02:38:08,474 --> 02:38:16,902
If any of the counselors have technology issues, I hope they would take up, I think, President Falco, you offered space in City Hall for anyone who needed it.

2121
02:38:17,790 --> 02:38:18,611
I hope they would take it up.

2122
02:38:18,671 --> 02:38:27,000
I don't really see the difference of having the council meeting in person if all of the residents are still gonna be not allowed in there anyway.

2123
02:38:28,001 --> 02:38:34,629
I would also say as well as what people have mentioned about the ADA and not being able to see lips move.

2124
02:38:35,729 --> 02:38:36,970
for folks who are hard of hearing.

2125
02:38:37,410 --> 02:38:39,011
There's also just a lot of body language.

2126
02:38:39,031 --> 02:38:51,377
So this is one of the reasons that in telehealth for therapy, it's actually more advantageous to be in Zoom where you can see the person's whole face rather than sitting six feet away with a mask on.

2127
02:38:51,818 --> 02:38:55,239
You can see a lot more of what's going on with somebody's facial expression on Zoom.

2128
02:38:56,640 --> 02:39:02,123
The last question I had was for Vice President Caravello.

2129
02:39:03,288 --> 02:39:10,213
I'd like you to explain your intention in reposting the statement from the Medford Police Patrolmen's Association this morning.

2130
02:39:10,594 --> 02:39:14,757
I noticed that Harold McGillivray, I think that's his name, is on this call right now.

2131
02:39:15,357 --> 02:39:26,105
And that that post talked about anti-police rhetoric and calls to cut the budget in the same statement that it talked about thanking you and the three other counselors for skipping out on the meeting and not attending.

2132
02:39:26,986 --> 02:39:29,828
I know that post was then taken down, so maybe a lot of people didn't see it.

2133
02:39:30,651 --> 02:39:42,156
But it seemed pretty clear to me that the intention was we want to have a zoom meeting Or we want to actually avoid a zoom meeting because in person feels like fewer people will attend Who are passionate about this issue?

2134
02:39:42,176 --> 02:39:56,003
I don't see why um You'd be reposting that unless you agree with that piece about anti-police rhetoric being a problem I don't hear a lot of anti-police rhetoric as about particular policemen.

2135
02:39:56,063 --> 02:39:56,483
I hear that

2136
02:39:56,928 --> 02:40:03,272
We're having kind of a reckoning in this country about anti-racism and the importance of, as people have been saying, this is a budget meeting.

2137
02:40:03,712 --> 02:40:12,777
If we have to choose where our money is going, does it make sense to keep the police funding at the exact same level and cut the schools?

2138
02:40:14,238 --> 02:40:25,605
So I also wanna echo, I think it was Rebecca and maybe Elisa, who you, Vice President Caravello, you said you were offended by their comments.

2139
02:40:27,457 --> 02:40:31,278
I think that being held accountable, again, they were completely polite.

2140
02:40:31,558 --> 02:40:34,098
That was not somebody disrespecting you.

2141
02:40:34,558 --> 02:40:38,139
I'm offended by the lack of a statement from all four of you.

2142
02:40:39,439 --> 02:40:49,341
And I would also just ask that commenting on constituents' physical appearances during this Zoom call, even if it's as a joke, that's probably something we should move away from.

2143
02:40:50,161 --> 02:40:54,282
So commenting on someone's eyes probably seems silly.

2144
02:40:54,322 --> 02:40:55,362
It probably seems really PC.

2145
02:40:56,385 --> 02:40:57,786
I would urge us not to do that too.

2146
02:40:58,086 --> 02:40:59,827
So that's all I have to say.

2147
02:40:59,867 --> 02:41:02,468
I'm gonna go to bed soon, but I'd love to hear a response from any of you.

2148
02:41:02,488 --> 02:41:05,110
Mr. President.

2149
02:41:06,110 --> 02:41:06,891
Councilor Scarpelli.

2150
02:41:07,231 --> 02:41:08,011
Thank you, Sophie.

2151
02:41:08,711 --> 02:41:15,275
Thank you, Sophie, for speaking tonight, but not at one time did I mention

2152
02:41:16,363 --> 02:41:25,467
Let's make an unhealthy choice and put people in a small room and with COVID being such a dangerous situation.

2153
02:41:26,128 --> 02:41:28,449
I'm a son of a mother that has diabetes.

2154
02:41:29,229 --> 02:41:30,710
I'm one of only two caregivers.

2155
02:41:31,471 --> 02:41:38,192
So I understand fully how to take precautions and be safe so I don't put her in harm's way.

2156
02:41:38,573 --> 02:41:39,033
Believe me.

2157
02:41:39,693 --> 02:41:44,194
So I never said that we're going to meet, that we should meet in a small room.

2158
02:41:44,214 --> 02:41:45,014
That's not an intent.

2159
02:41:45,474 --> 02:41:50,475
The intent again, because this is what I find a little disheartening.

2160
02:41:51,295 --> 02:41:56,336
We're trying to not divide and to stay together.

2161
02:41:57,097 --> 02:41:58,877
But the same thing keeps coming up.

2162
02:42:00,166 --> 02:42:01,227
We had questions.

2163
02:42:02,348 --> 02:42:13,077
So during the procedures, I talked about this at the beginning, we a month before the budget, months before the budget, wanted to have something in person.

2164
02:42:13,498 --> 02:42:17,781
As the process carried on up until this past week,

2165
02:42:18,735 --> 02:42:32,660
We were hoping something would come out that we could have both a Zoom and an in-person meeting to try to have counselors in a safe location where they could be social distance away with a mask.

2166
02:42:33,220 --> 02:42:44,725
We would have the constituent that has a question to approach the rail, which is more than 10 to 15 feet away, where they can take their mask off and interact with the council.

2167
02:42:45,785 --> 02:42:48,006
And we have plenty of room that if we just

2168
02:42:49,265 --> 02:42:54,229
that we would move our financial group and our speakers to one side.

2169
02:42:55,289 --> 02:42:59,012
So the process is just even to evaluate that, to look into that.

2170
02:43:00,192 --> 02:43:03,495
But personally, I didn't feel like that was heard.

2171
02:43:04,195 --> 02:43:14,402
So I took the stand that I'm not going to show at a meeting where a person or people, not one person, God forbid I say one person, that people are not heard.

2172
02:43:15,322 --> 02:43:19,126
Why didn't you just make a statement about that on Saturday morning then because you know what?

2173
02:43:19,206 --> 02:43:23,852
I we also have families We also have other things that are going on.

2174
02:43:23,872 --> 02:43:33,843
I'm also Saturday night Sunday morning Sunday evening if I didn't return your email, I apologize, but I've been listen

2175
02:43:34,263 --> 02:43:37,345
to the communities, communities applaud.

2176
02:43:37,746 --> 02:43:38,786
I got a lot of emails.

2177
02:43:38,826 --> 02:43:39,787
I got a lot of phone calls.

2178
02:43:40,107 --> 02:43:43,010
I spent a lot of time away from my family.

2179
02:43:43,270 --> 02:43:45,732
Like I said, I'm one of only two caregivers to my mom.

2180
02:43:46,112 --> 02:43:49,895
So Saturday and Sunday, my sister's a teacher who just got moved by the way.

2181
02:43:50,315 --> 02:43:51,496
So my sister's a teacher.

2182
02:43:51,536 --> 02:43:54,718
So I try to find time that I could spend with my mom.

2183
02:43:55,078 --> 02:43:57,981
So I tried as much as I could, many times I could to try to

2184
02:43:58,581 --> 02:44:04,186
But you were planning on attending that meeting initially, so presumably you had carved out time to attend it?

2185
02:44:04,226 --> 02:44:07,029
Didn't have like 10 minutes to issue a statement?

2186
02:44:07,149 --> 02:44:14,617
Again, I'm gonna share this with you, that unfortunately, Councilor Falco and I have worked together for over 11 years.

2187
02:44:15,137 --> 02:44:16,659
We've worked very well together.

2188
02:44:17,479 --> 02:44:22,084
But the conversation Councilor Falco and I had, unfortunately,

2189
02:44:23,513 --> 02:44:28,874
There was a misunderstanding that he asked, George, are you coming to the Zoom?

2190
02:44:29,334 --> 02:44:30,215
And I said, no.

2191
02:44:30,715 --> 02:44:35,156
He was meaning my Somerville Zoom meeting in my municipal job that I work in.

2192
02:44:35,696 --> 02:44:40,017
So that was a clear misunderstanding, something that we both didn't know.

2193
02:44:40,237 --> 02:44:41,777
I was offended with Councilor Falco.

2194
02:44:42,057 --> 02:44:43,877
I'm sure he was offended by my actions.

2195
02:44:44,237 --> 02:44:46,938
But at the same time, these are the things that lost and

2196
02:44:47,418 --> 02:44:52,060
What about the next two meetings then so you still after the after the Saturday issue?

2197
02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:55,181
Like the next one was it on Monday?

2198
02:44:55,201 --> 02:44:59,023
All right Monday and Tuesday, is that correct?

2199
02:44:59,363 --> 02:45:07,407
I was on all three I was waiting on all three and again, I wasn't going to go to those meetings I don't understand why you don't understand by going to those meetings.

2200
02:45:07,427 --> 02:45:07,447
I

2201
02:45:08,734 --> 02:45:09,754
Issuing a statement.

2202
02:45:09,794 --> 02:45:16,937
I'm saying if you don't go to the don't go to the meetings Why are you off issuing a statement saying this is why I'm not attending, you know, why Sophie?

2203
02:45:16,957 --> 02:45:17,777
Why did we get nothing?

2204
02:45:17,797 --> 02:45:25,240
There's over 200 calls and emails and phone calls both for and against and there's a lot of people that were for that supported me I am

2205
02:45:30,122 --> 02:45:39,469
I'm not calling me if I did if I spent all that time doing that it took time away from my family I'm not saying to answer each individual email.

2206
02:45:39,529 --> 02:45:48,716
I'm saying to issue one statement one I'm used to being interrupted, but I would like you to answer why you couldn't do one at a time please one at a time

2207
02:45:49,897 --> 02:46:00,263
So again, so Tuesday night, the meeting Saturday, Monday, today, tonight, I felt it was appeasable for I to make my comment and statement tonight.

2208
02:46:00,584 --> 02:46:04,146
If that doesn't suit you, Sophie, there's nothing I can do about that.

2209
02:46:04,706 --> 02:46:07,088
So we can agree to disagree and move on.

2210
02:46:07,148 --> 02:46:09,509
My statement was made for tonight.

2211
02:46:09,589 --> 02:46:09,909
That's it.

2212
02:46:09,929 --> 02:46:14,972
So I can reach all the constituents that are on the call, that are at home watching the video.

2213
02:46:15,553 --> 02:46:16,733
And if it doesn't suit you,

2214
02:46:17,734 --> 02:46:20,355
and I don't have your support again, or ever, that's fine.

2215
02:46:20,635 --> 02:46:21,115
That's life.

2216
02:46:21,536 --> 02:46:22,096
And we move on.

2217
02:46:22,316 --> 02:46:23,757
That's what being an elected official is.

2218
02:46:24,437 --> 02:46:25,517
So we can move.

2219
02:46:25,617 --> 02:46:25,857
Right.

2220
02:46:25,917 --> 02:46:32,360
I would hope that next time if there's a situation like this, it might think that it makes sense to issue it at the decision making point.

2221
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:40,163
But I'll tell you what, if I had the same situation like this where constituents that felt that they weren't being treated fairly, then I would do the same exact thing.

2222
02:46:40,964 --> 02:46:41,424
But thank you.

2223
02:46:43,435 --> 02:46:45,076
Anybody else who would like to respond?

2224
02:46:45,776 --> 02:46:49,618
Especially Vice President Caravello about the police patrolman.

2225
02:46:49,658 --> 02:46:52,439
I'd love to hear from you about your statement on it.

2226
02:46:52,739 --> 02:46:53,860
It's Richard Caravello.

2227
02:46:56,381 --> 02:46:56,841
Excuse me?

2228
02:46:58,402 --> 02:47:00,603
Vice President Caravello, are you on the call still?

2229
02:47:06,145 --> 02:47:07,866
Mr. Clerk, do you have Vice President Caravello?

2230
02:47:07,886 --> 02:47:08,926
Yeah, I'm trying to unmute him right now.

2231
02:47:08,986 --> 02:47:09,727
I'm trying to unmute him.

2232
02:47:10,227 --> 02:47:11,808
Okay, he's on the phone now.

2233
02:47:11,828 --> 02:47:12,388
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

2234
02:47:13,537 --> 02:47:14,337
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

2235
02:47:14,418 --> 02:47:15,038
I apologize.

2236
02:47:15,058 --> 02:47:18,019
My computer has died, and I do need to buy a new one this week.

2237
02:47:19,240 --> 02:47:22,302
But again, my comments for the police patrolman.

2238
02:47:23,122 --> 02:47:28,745
I've always been an advocate of public safety for the policemen, and I'm never going to change that stance.

2239
02:47:29,576 --> 02:47:33,518
I mean, these are the men and women who protect that community.

2240
02:47:34,338 --> 02:47:44,023
I have full faith in the chief that he'll put together the proper safeguards that'll make everybody in this community comfortable.

2241
02:47:44,043 --> 02:47:53,788
I guess- Do you believe then that that means that not a penny should be deducted from a police budget to go toward those- Point of information, Mr. President.

2242
02:47:54,188 --> 02:47:55,589
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

2243
02:47:56,329 --> 02:48:09,278
Are we debating the budget tonight, mr. President, mr. President Time to debate the budget this is not a night to debate the budget.

2244
02:48:09,338 --> 02:48:22,147
Okay, just that he reposted something that referenced it And I stand behind the Memphis Police Department 100% My public safety is the number one concern in this community always

2245
02:48:23,106 --> 02:48:27,853
The residents, these men and women go out and put their lives on the line every day.

2246
02:48:29,055 --> 02:48:33,982
So again, they have my 100% support and I'll never change that.

2247
02:48:34,002 --> 02:48:37,367
So any other questions you want to ask me, I'm happy to answer.

2248
02:48:38,324 --> 02:48:45,469
Well, I mean, I guess we're not talking about the budget, but talking about sort of the big scandal last year with overtime and all of those.

2249
02:48:45,489 --> 02:48:46,069
We got to stop.

2250
02:48:46,109 --> 02:48:46,469
We got time.

2251
02:48:46,489 --> 02:48:49,031
I'm not going to participate in this foolishness.

2252
02:48:49,071 --> 02:48:49,571
I'm trying to talk.

2253
02:48:49,651 --> 02:48:49,872
Okay.

2254
02:49:08,204 --> 02:49:09,125
Thank you, Mr. President.

2255
02:49:09,305 --> 02:49:14,692
Mr. President, there's obviously no appeasing anybody that's on these calls this evening.

2256
02:49:14,712 --> 02:49:17,956
So again, I'll wait till we get back to the regular audit business.

2257
02:49:18,416 --> 02:49:22,021
Again, this is just turning into a name calling and catfighting.

2258
02:49:22,041 --> 02:49:23,723
I didn't call anyone any names.

2259
02:49:24,743 --> 02:49:25,664
Okay.

2260
02:49:26,344 --> 02:49:31,407
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna answer any more questions until we until we get back to the regular order business.

2261
02:49:31,427 --> 02:49:33,968
These are going nowhere.

2262
02:49:34,849 --> 02:49:46,035
If I may, we'll be talking all the budget related questions regarding the police in anything regarding the police that should be held to the budget meeting, which the budget schedule will come out, most likely.

2263
02:49:48,079 --> 02:49:48,519
Thursday.

2264
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:49,940
So okay, thank you.

2265
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:51,841
Okay, thank you.

2266
02:49:52,282 --> 02:49:55,363
So I'm gonna try to call some other people that have not been called on yet.

2267
02:49:55,844 --> 02:49:58,445
So we have let's see, Jessica has her hand up.

2268
02:49:58,565 --> 02:50:00,587
Jessica, is it Ravitchio?

2269
02:50:02,568 --> 02:50:04,409
If you could please have your name and address for the record.

2270
02:50:05,325 --> 02:50:07,167
Hold on, Mr. President.

2271
02:50:07,988 --> 02:50:10,030
My address is 622 Boston Ave.

2272
02:50:11,811 --> 02:50:13,112
My name is Jessica Rivicchio.

2273
02:50:13,933 --> 02:50:26,846
And I first want to start out by giving my heartfelt thank you to Michael Marks, Rick Caraviello is his name, Adam Knight, and George Scarpelli.

2274
02:50:27,944 --> 02:50:37,107
I wanna thank these men for making sure that when they brought themselves to the table to have this discussion, that they had all the facts that they wanted.

2275
02:50:37,127 --> 02:50:45,709
Because there have been previous meetings where it was happened over a weekend and under the table, and most of us didn't even know what hit us.

2276
02:50:46,330 --> 02:50:52,251
So I wanna thank these four men for appreciating what they do for this city and taking the time to be well-informed.

2277
02:50:53,052 --> 02:50:57,113
Second of all, I wanna ask, is there a time limit for constituents to speak?

2278
02:50:57,820 --> 02:50:58,780
Because of the school committee.

2279
02:50:58,820 --> 02:50:59,961
No, more than 10 minutes.

2280
02:51:00,521 --> 02:51:02,181
Oh, the school committee is three.

2281
02:51:02,201 --> 02:51:03,622
It should be much less than this meeting too.

2282
02:51:05,162 --> 02:51:05,562
Thank you.

2283
02:51:07,123 --> 02:51:09,344
Everyone keeps talking about that everyone needs to be heard.

2284
02:51:10,204 --> 02:51:17,126
This meeting and the previous school committee meeting have probably the same 250 people on it at both meetings.

2285
02:51:17,526 --> 02:51:19,307
So again, we're still not reaching Medford.

2286
02:51:19,787 --> 02:51:22,688
And the idea that we are is ludicrous.

2287
02:51:23,753 --> 02:51:25,094
is absolutely disgusting.

2288
02:51:25,874 --> 02:51:29,796
There are members of this city that are not being reached in these conversations.

2289
02:51:30,216 --> 02:51:39,181
So major things happen with the school committee led by Mr. Rousseau and underhanded by Mr. Beers and Mrs. Morrell, whatever her name is.

2290
02:51:39,201 --> 02:51:45,985
But I want to appreciate that these four men have stood up for this city and the time they have put into it.

2291
02:51:46,625 --> 02:51:51,568
And I want to say that I want to thank personally Mr. McGillivray

2292
02:51:51,968 --> 02:51:57,754
and every single individual man and woman on that police department that puts themselves on the line for us every single day.

2293
02:51:57,774 --> 02:52:07,884
Most people on this phone call wouldn't have the nerve to do that, but I'm gonna remind you that our police department is extremely important to this city.

2294
02:52:09,585 --> 02:52:11,908
I have family members on this police department.

2295
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:20,106
And I think all this constant bickering back and forth about why you did this and why you did that, they are the counselors.

2296
02:52:20,546 --> 02:52:22,188
They do their jobs.

2297
02:52:22,668 --> 02:52:24,170
Nobody has to put out a statement.

2298
02:52:24,530 --> 02:52:28,733
No one has to tuck you in at night and make sure you're well known about what's happening.

2299
02:52:29,154 --> 02:52:30,235
No one has to do that.

2300
02:52:31,986 --> 02:52:38,249
And I'm really sick and tired of all the people, part of OR, coming on these calls and beating you guys to heck.

2301
02:52:38,530 --> 02:52:42,412
So I am going to say my piece and be like, thank you to the four gentlemen.

2302
02:52:42,872 --> 02:52:43,732
Thank you so much.

2303
02:52:44,073 --> 02:52:49,396
And to the woman who tried to ask Councilor Scarpelli where he was, and she got no answer.

2304
02:52:49,816 --> 02:52:52,537
He had stepped away to take care of his dog from barking.

2305
02:52:52,898 --> 02:52:58,661
So just so you think that these councils are not responding to you, they're human beings.

2306
02:52:58,721 --> 02:53:00,322
They have lives outside of this.

2307
02:53:01,574 --> 02:53:08,021
And this whole nonsense is started by Mr. Rousseau, Mrs. Morrell, and Mr. Beers.

2308
02:53:08,842 --> 02:53:13,506
And all I have to say is, I'm disgraced and I'm disgusted at the three of you.

2309
02:53:14,547 --> 02:53:14,948
Thank you.

2310
02:53:14,968 --> 02:53:17,070
Point of information, Mr. President.

2311
02:53:18,431 --> 02:53:19,112
Oh, here we go.

2312
02:53:21,154 --> 02:53:22,876
Councilor Beers, point of information.

2313
02:53:23,627 --> 02:53:26,691
Were you aware that I had the power to just do whatever I want in the city?

2314
02:53:26,711 --> 02:53:28,032
Because I certainly wasn't.

2315
02:53:28,053 --> 02:53:32,999
And I just want to thank, again, the hundreds of people who keep turning out and participating in city government.

2316
02:53:33,079 --> 02:53:34,921
So thank you very much, Mr. President.

2317
02:53:34,961 --> 02:53:36,022
Thank you, Councilor Piers.

2318
02:53:36,062 --> 02:53:36,964
We have up next.

2319
02:53:36,984 --> 02:53:37,985
Can I finish?

2320
02:53:38,005 --> 02:53:39,547
Can I respond to him quickly?

2321
02:53:40,515 --> 02:53:41,176
Quickly, please.

2322
02:53:41,516 --> 02:53:42,437
Okay, I promise you.

2323
02:53:43,458 --> 02:53:54,228
I appreciate that you're trying to show face here and trying to make people believe that you're not something that you are, but those of us who know what you do, it's never gonna be forgotten.

2324
02:53:55,749 --> 02:53:57,090
I grew up in the city.

2325
02:53:57,811 --> 02:53:58,191
I live here.

2326
02:53:58,271 --> 02:53:59,932
I don't actually care to speak to you.

2327
02:53:59,992 --> 02:54:01,613
I don't know what you're saying.

2328
02:54:01,853 --> 02:54:03,234
One at a time.

2329
02:54:03,354 --> 02:54:05,196
If you want to make accusations, make them.

2330
02:54:05,236 --> 02:54:07,437
Mr. Marks, I thank Mr. Caraviello.

2331
02:54:07,557 --> 02:54:08,738
I thank Mr. Scarpelli.

2332
02:54:09,138 --> 02:54:11,520
And I thank Adam Knight, who I went to high school with.

2333
02:54:12,080 --> 02:54:17,264
And I thank them very much for their dedication to making sure they have all the facts when they come to the table.

2334
02:54:17,584 --> 02:54:17,985
Thank you.

2335
02:54:18,285 --> 02:54:19,065
Thank you, Jessica.

2336
02:54:19,346 --> 02:54:20,386
We have Nathan going up next.

2337
02:54:20,406 --> 02:54:20,666
Nathan.

2338
02:54:20,727 --> 02:54:20,847
Bye.

2339
02:54:20,867 --> 02:54:23,388
Mr. President, point of information.

2340
02:54:25,153 --> 02:54:27,114
Point of information, Councilor Beers.

2341
02:54:27,895 --> 02:54:35,300
I just want to say that, you know, if people are going to throw around accusations, they would actually say what they're trying to say, because it just sounds like dog whistling to me.

2342
02:54:35,400 --> 02:54:35,981
So thank you.

2343
02:54:36,341 --> 02:54:37,262
Thank you.

2344
02:54:37,302 --> 02:54:38,463
Let's see, Nathan Guerin.

2345
02:54:38,483 --> 02:54:40,504
Name and address for the record, please.

2346
02:54:41,625 --> 02:54:45,328
My name is Nathan Guerin, and my address is 126 Monument Street in West Bedford.

2347
02:54:46,789 --> 02:54:52,713
I just wanted to say this is my first council meeting, and I'm really energized by all the other citizens here, and really excited by what I've been hearing.

2348
02:54:53,875 --> 02:54:59,199
I came into this meeting with an open mind, and I wanted to hear out the four council members who missed the earlier budget meetings.

2349
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:11,428
I had read a little bit but of course I wanted to hear their own words and I just want to say that I'm just echo something that I think the majority of the people in this meeting have said, I'm still really disappointed and I'm not satisfied by their statements.

2350
02:55:12,028 --> 02:55:12,429
councilmembers.

2351
02:55:12,689 --> 02:55:23,485
At one point, I think, it might have been Councilmember Falco, I might be wrong, I'm sorry, mentioned that when four councilmembers who are very senior have a feeling that something is wrong, all individually without

2352
02:55:27,190 --> 02:55:48,140
Like that that mean that that means something and that I agree with that But I also think that the majority of this people of the people in this call with these citizens of medford have all felt that Something was wrong with four counselors missing so many budget meetings Um, and I don't think anybody here that came in with thinking about that or and I think many of us came in with an open mind waiting to be

2353
02:55:48,853 --> 02:55:51,094
Like, I don't know, I could have been convinced.

2354
02:55:51,715 --> 02:55:55,797
I don't think anybody has accepted those explanations and I'm really disappointed.

2355
02:55:55,917 --> 02:56:00,880
And we'll take that decision to the ballot box next year, unless there's a bunch of things that happen in the interim, but who knows?

2356
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:12,807
Also, I want to thank councilman's moral bears for just really reasonable, not like being getting really defensive at comments.

2357
02:56:13,427 --> 02:56:14,928
And finally, thank you so much, President Falco.

2358
02:56:14,968 --> 02:56:18,230
I know it's really hard to do these kinds of zoom meetings and I really think you're doing a good job.

2359
02:56:19,310 --> 02:56:19,771
Thank you.

2360
02:56:20,291 --> 02:56:21,231
I'm trying my best.

2361
02:56:21,251 --> 02:56:22,132
Thank you so much.

2362
02:56:22,172 --> 02:56:23,012
I appreciate it.

2363
02:56:23,032 --> 02:56:26,394
I didn't make that other comment, though, when you mentioned about the four counselors.

2364
02:56:26,494 --> 02:56:27,294
That wasn't me.

2365
02:56:27,894 --> 02:56:29,015
But thank you for your kind words.

2366
02:56:29,055 --> 02:56:30,535
I appreciate it.

2367
02:56:30,575 --> 02:56:31,236
Let's see.

2368
02:56:31,796 --> 02:56:33,817
Dean Tognarelli, name and address for the record.

2369
02:56:37,659 --> 02:56:37,959
Hello.

2370
02:56:38,159 --> 02:56:40,760
This is Dean Tognarelli, 95 North Street, Medford.

2371
02:56:42,583 --> 02:56:44,424
I just wanted to say a couple things.

2372
02:56:44,504 --> 02:56:51,549
I really haven't been to the City Council meetings, but in support of everything that's going online, I wanted to say a couple things.

2373
02:56:51,629 --> 02:56:53,870
The one, I think that experience matters.

2374
02:56:55,151 --> 02:57:05,037
There is something to be said about knowing the procedures and how they went on and having been in part of successful budget meetings and gotten things through.

2375
02:57:05,177 --> 02:57:06,738
So I think experience does matter.

2376
02:57:07,258 --> 02:57:17,120
And in support of the four people that didn't show up for the budget meeting, I'd just like to say that doing what you think is right, even when it's unpopular or difficult, that means something, too.

2377
02:57:17,240 --> 02:57:23,041
So some people have voiced their opinion that they would not vote because they didn't like that the people didn't show up.

2378
02:57:23,541 --> 02:57:26,481
Well, I'm one person that did think it's important.

2379
02:57:26,821 --> 02:57:31,002
And I appreciate that they did vote what was hard, even if they thought it would hurt them.

2380
02:57:31,362 --> 02:57:32,722
And they haven't lost my vote.

2381
02:57:32,882 --> 02:57:33,783
So I just wanted to say that.

2382
02:57:34,223 --> 02:57:35,603
And I thank you all for your hard work.

2383
02:57:36,408 --> 02:57:36,948
Thank you, Dean.

2384
02:57:39,090 --> 02:57:43,593
Let's see.

2385
02:57:44,394 --> 02:57:46,615
Rachel H. I don't think you've gone yet.

2386
02:57:47,576 --> 02:57:50,378
Hi, can you hear me?

2387
02:57:50,418 --> 02:57:52,780
Can you hear me?

2388
02:57:53,380 --> 02:57:53,600
Yes.

2389
02:57:54,140 --> 02:57:54,581
Okay, great.

2390
02:57:54,821 --> 02:57:55,682
My name is Rachel Holmes.

2391
02:57:56,122 --> 02:57:57,683
I live at 13 Albion Street.

2392
02:58:00,725 --> 02:58:06,009
So a lot's been going on, but I just would like to ask

2393
02:58:06,465 --> 02:58:18,090
the councillors to jointly consider the following questions when you have your meeting tomorrow to talk about the feasibility of hybrid or altering this Zoom meeting plan.

2394
02:58:18,711 --> 02:58:25,053
So these are the questions that I've thought about and don't necessarily have answers to after our discussion today.

2395
02:58:25,574 --> 02:58:27,534
And I don't think we can get to answers today.

2396
02:58:28,255 --> 02:58:34,077
I don't have faith that my questions will be answered clearly and concisely, so I just want to ask them.

2397
02:58:35,716 --> 02:58:44,660
The first question is, we've talked a lot about having everybody be eye to eye and see each other when having these discussions.

2398
02:58:45,241 --> 02:58:49,863
And my first question is regarding how many people would that involve?

2399
02:58:50,043 --> 02:58:53,364
How many people would be involved in such a discussion?

2400
02:58:54,245 --> 02:59:01,448
And how does that compare to the space available that you have in City Hall or whatever kind of facility you might find for this?

2401
02:59:03,323 --> 02:59:11,508
I think I heard that all the city counselors need to join department heads, other city employees, but I'm not sure of the rules on that.

2402
02:59:13,009 --> 02:59:23,836
The next question that I have is, I hear the point about governments can meet, that the order does not apply to government bodies.

2403
02:59:23,916 --> 02:59:32,581
I understand that that is possible, but I am curious regarding the rules for non-government officials in those situations.

2404
02:59:33,142 --> 02:59:42,048
It's understandable if a group of government officials can have a meeting, but I don't think it's clear yet what that means for members of the public.

2405
02:59:42,309 --> 02:59:50,094
If the goal of this is to have members of the public join in these discussions, I think that needs to be clarified before planning occurs.

2406
02:59:52,796 --> 02:59:56,519
The next thing is regarding the venue again.

2407
02:59:57,098 --> 03:00:05,725
which is how many citizens would be allowed to attend such a meeting if that's the point of these negotiations?

2408
03:00:06,406 --> 03:00:13,191
And then how would those attendees be selected or chosen or how would you be allowed to join that meeting or not?

2409
03:00:13,912 --> 03:00:19,136
If there is such a process or do people line up outside, how would that logistically work?

2410
03:00:19,577 --> 03:00:20,497
Because I myself,

2411
03:00:21,972 --> 03:00:27,673
do not have a high risk situation, I would plan to attend such a meeting in person and I'd be very curious about that process.

2412
03:00:29,994 --> 03:00:51,039
And then the last question that I have is once you consider all of those factors and all of the other factors, I am not considering as not a public health official, just as a person doing math in their head and thinking about the space available and the goals that are at hand, would be how long would it actually take to come

2413
03:00:51,438 --> 03:01:03,249
together with such a plan, with all of the logistics that would be involved and all of the coordination, do we have enough time to create such a plan that would be safe and accessible to those that need it?

2414
03:01:04,490 --> 03:01:10,256
And if that math doesn't work, I think we really need to move quickly and get back to the budget discussions.

2415
03:01:11,197 --> 03:01:12,618
And that is all I have to say, thank you.

2416
03:01:13,150 --> 03:01:13,830
Thank you, Rachel.

2417
03:01:14,151 --> 03:01:16,692
A lot of great questions you had there.

2418
03:01:16,752 --> 03:01:18,313
I have some of those same questions.

2419
03:01:18,393 --> 03:01:23,276
And I think one of the biggest, most important pieces that you mentioned is time.

2420
03:01:23,956 --> 03:01:26,958
We're at a point now where we are literally running out of time.

2421
03:01:27,078 --> 03:01:37,264
So if we can't get answers to those questions, if we don't feel confident that a hybrid type of meeting can occur, then it's my opinion that we would have to go

2422
03:01:38,084 --> 03:01:47,250
with the current system, which would be Zoom meetings, which I know they're not perfect, but we've been doing them now for three, four months.

2423
03:01:47,670 --> 03:01:48,431
And you know what?

2424
03:01:48,551 --> 03:01:51,373
I mean, we've had probably more participation than ever before.

2425
03:01:52,193 --> 03:02:02,380
So like I said, they're not perfect, but whatever solution we come up with, I promise Zoom will be a component of that solution.

2426
03:02:02,480 --> 03:02:05,622
So you can rest assured of that, okay?

2427
03:02:07,049 --> 03:02:07,450
Thank you.

2428
03:02:08,151 --> 03:02:09,655
Let's see, we have Zach Gordon.

2429
03:02:10,256 --> 03:02:11,519
Name and address for the record, please.

2430
03:02:13,383 --> 03:02:14,926
Yes, hi, I'm Zach Gordon.

2431
03:02:14,966 --> 03:02:17,472
I'm at 82 Bristol Road in South Medford.

2432
03:02:19,354 --> 03:02:25,057
I don't want to dig too much into my personal opinions on the matters of the best way to go forward with the meeting.

2433
03:02:25,117 --> 03:02:28,659
I think a lot of my neighbors have brought up some very excellent points throughout the discussion.

2434
03:02:29,619 --> 03:02:38,704
Really, I just wanted to echo what people like, I believe, Sophie said, where this whole meeting could have been about the budget if there had been some statements put out ahead of time.

2435
03:02:39,044 --> 03:02:42,986
I certainly appreciate that the counselors have families and lives of their own.

2436
03:02:43,906 --> 03:02:47,149
I don't want to be an undue burden on that in the sake of transparency.

2437
03:02:47,249 --> 03:02:50,852
But instead of answering 200 emails, you could put out a single statement.

2438
03:02:51,393 --> 03:02:57,358
And I would encourage the counselors to make better and stronger use of the city website.

2439
03:02:57,959 --> 03:03:02,703
I've heard quite a few comments about how social media is not the right platform for some of these discussions.

2440
03:03:02,743 --> 03:03:07,928
And I would just encourage you to increase transparency through putting out some of these communications on the city website.

2441
03:03:09,929 --> 03:03:10,430
Thank you, Zach.

2442
03:03:11,056 --> 03:03:11,276
Thank you.

2443
03:03:11,296 --> 03:03:12,797
Point of information, Mr. President.

2444
03:03:13,037 --> 03:03:14,799
Point of information, Councilor Pierce.

2445
03:03:15,759 --> 03:03:23,605
Just to your point, my fellow, Zach, there's some items on the agenda later in the agenda that I put on that would address how the council is communicating and engaging the public.

2446
03:03:23,705 --> 03:03:24,846
So thanks for your comments.

2447
03:03:25,967 --> 03:03:26,607
Thank you, Councilor.

2448
03:03:27,267 --> 03:03:27,668
Thank you.

2449
03:03:27,828 --> 03:03:30,129
Appreciate the remark there, Zach.

2450
03:03:31,369 --> 03:03:37,134
good name, but I don't know if I missed it on the website, but I was having trouble finding this agenda.

2451
03:03:37,174 --> 03:03:41,358
So again, just a point where the city website could be a little fine-tuned.

2452
03:03:41,438 --> 03:03:46,982
And I know that you've made some efforts to be very transparent on social media, and as a constituent, I certainly appreciate that.

2453
03:03:47,823 --> 03:03:50,886
Yeah, if you go to the events calendar, you should be able to get a link.

2454
03:03:50,946 --> 03:03:55,950
It wasn't posted in the upcoming meeting section this week because our website is, it's, yeah.

2455
03:03:56,791 --> 03:03:57,871
I know it's a work in progress.

2456
03:03:59,052 --> 03:03:59,593
Mr. President.

2457
03:04:00,133 --> 03:04:00,834
Thank you, Zach.

2458
03:04:01,295 --> 03:04:01,795
Thank you.

2459
03:04:02,336 --> 03:04:04,458
Did I hear, did I hear Constance Capelli?

2460
03:04:04,558 --> 03:04:04,859
I'm sorry.

2461
03:04:04,959 --> 03:04:05,880
Thank you, Mr. President.

2462
03:04:06,521 --> 03:04:10,645
And Zach, thank you for your question and your concerns.

2463
03:04:11,186 --> 03:04:17,493
I, whether you, whether you agree or disagree with me, that's, that's, that's democracy.

2464
03:04:18,214 --> 03:04:19,775
But this is my statement.

2465
03:04:20,015 --> 03:04:22,957
This evening is where I held for my statement.

2466
03:04:23,477 --> 03:04:24,598
So that's what I did.

2467
03:04:24,818 --> 03:04:29,901
And if it's not not to your standard, that's okay, too, because you know what?

2468
03:04:30,381 --> 03:04:35,684
Whatever we need to do to find a way to break the divide and get everybody back together.

2469
03:04:36,045 --> 03:04:36,825
This is what I said.

2470
03:04:36,885 --> 03:04:38,586
Like again, I've been saying this for weeks.

2471
03:04:39,106 --> 03:04:43,769
Please be careful to our community because what we're hearing what we're seeing was dividing us.

2472
03:04:43,869 --> 03:04:45,210
So thank you very much.

2473
03:04:45,230 --> 03:04:46,711
I appreciate it, Mr President.

2474
03:04:47,604 --> 03:04:48,724
I can count on Scott Kelly.

2475
03:04:49,504 --> 03:04:49,825
Let's see.

2476
03:04:49,865 --> 03:04:52,685
We have, um, uh, let's see.

2477
03:04:53,125 --> 03:04:54,986
Sonu Malik Lewis.

2478
03:04:56,166 --> 03:04:57,466
Apologize if I didn't get that right.

2479
03:04:57,486 --> 03:05:01,647
No problem.

2480
03:05:01,667 --> 03:05:02,087
Thank you.

2481
03:05:02,607 --> 03:05:03,908
Give me a name and address for the record.

2482
03:05:11,089 --> 03:05:11,289
Yes.

2483
03:05:11,490 --> 03:05:12,130
Can you hear me?

2484
03:05:12,470 --> 03:05:13,290
Yes, I can hear you now.

2485
03:05:15,229 --> 03:05:19,171
Hi, yes, it's Malik Lewis from 25 Adams Street on the hillside.

2486
03:05:19,231 --> 03:05:21,572
Thank you, President Falco, for taking my comment.

2487
03:05:23,793 --> 03:05:28,416
Thank you, President Falco again, and thank you to all the council members for your time this evening.

2488
03:05:29,696 --> 03:05:35,919
I am a longtime resident here in Medford, and this is probably my second or third meeting.

2489
03:05:37,757 --> 03:05:46,644
But I just wanted to raise my hand to weigh in just to say that, you know, I'm not normally involved.

2490
03:05:47,084 --> 03:05:53,289
I'm here working, working from home and just trying to

2491
03:05:54,350 --> 03:06:00,978
to become a little bit more involved and to have a little bit more access to what's going on in city government.

2492
03:06:01,839 --> 03:06:12,371
So I just wanted to thank you, President Falco, for organizing this meeting and to also just say that, you know, I'm really struck by

2493
03:06:12,991 --> 03:06:20,957
the kind of level of participation that we're seeing over the last couple of days, couple of weeks in this process.

2494
03:06:20,997 --> 03:06:26,501
And I personally think that that's something that should be encouraged.

2495
03:06:27,061 --> 03:06:36,148
Obviously, there's a lot going on in the world, but I think that as a citizen, as an attorney, as a taxpayer, as neighbors,

2496
03:06:39,171 --> 03:06:45,393
I think this is something that we should all be happy about, that we're here at the table to have this discussion.

2497
03:06:45,433 --> 03:06:59,676
So I'm not here to comment on what may have happened in the past or any of the divisions, but I look forward to continuing to participate and to continuing to have this access, because I think it's important for the community going forward.

2498
03:06:59,856 --> 03:07:01,416
So thank you, President Falco, again, for the time.

2499
03:07:02,417 --> 03:07:03,137
Thank you very much.

2500
03:07:03,157 --> 03:07:04,397
Mr. President?

2501
03:07:05,597 --> 03:07:06,198
Let's see.

2502
03:07:06,258 --> 03:07:07,558
That sounds like Councilor Marks.

2503
03:07:08,342 --> 03:07:10,783
I just wanted to personally thank Malik for his comments.

2504
03:07:11,023 --> 03:07:16,805
And to me, a comment like that goes a long way in putting the divide down and moving forward.

2505
03:07:16,865 --> 03:07:18,426
And I think that's what we all want right now.

2506
03:07:18,806 --> 03:07:20,266
And I really appreciate those comments.

2507
03:07:20,546 --> 03:07:21,126
Absolutely.

2508
03:07:21,166 --> 03:07:21,507
Thank you.

2509
03:07:21,987 --> 03:07:23,067
Thank you, Tom, very much.

2510
03:07:23,187 --> 03:07:25,228
And thank you, Malik, for those comments as well.

2511
03:07:26,588 --> 03:07:29,950
Let's see, we have, is it Natalia Reddick?

2512
03:07:31,970 --> 03:07:33,331
Name and address for the record, please.

2513
03:07:33,831 --> 03:07:36,692
Hi, my name's Natalia Reddick, and I'm at 52 Canal Street.

2514
03:07:38,025 --> 03:08:05,872
I would like to continue on the week's words and just pointing out something that I found very concerning was when Councillor Caravaglio earlier, kind of in a rush of words, said that he wasn't going to engage, I believe, until things were back to normal and that the people on this call are not to be reasoned with, which I,

2515
03:08:06,510 --> 03:08:12,311
but I'm very concerning because these are your constituents and- Mr. President, point of information.

2516
03:08:12,331 --> 03:08:14,351
Councilor Marks, point of information.

2517
03:08:14,932 --> 03:08:22,773
I think what Councilor Caviello said was he was gonna wait till the regular agenda when we get back to the regular agenda to participate.

2518
03:08:22,813 --> 03:08:23,653
I won't speak for him.

2519
03:08:23,893 --> 03:08:29,774
But he also mentioned he's having problems with his- Right.

2520
03:08:29,974 --> 03:08:31,274
I just want that to be clear.

2521
03:08:31,675 --> 03:08:32,895
You are correct, Councilor Marks.

2522
03:08:32,915 --> 03:08:33,995
Thank you for clarifying.

2523
03:08:34,672 --> 03:08:36,453
I appreciate the clarification, for sure.

2524
03:08:36,633 --> 03:08:46,119
I think I just want to state that this is the new normal, and that we should all feel welcome in having a voice here on this platform.

2525
03:08:46,360 --> 03:08:58,227
And just kind of recognizing that when you're shutting people down, especially women, and interrupting people, it doesn't really reflect well on our community.

2526
03:08:58,447 --> 03:08:59,468
So that's all I wanted to say.

2527
03:09:00,028 --> 03:09:00,349
Thank you.

2528
03:09:11,322 --> 03:09:14,284
Teresa, name and address of the record, please.

2529
03:09:18,628 --> 03:09:21,210
Hi, it's actually Mike Denton.

2530
03:09:21,350 --> 03:09:23,692
I live at 1 Bellevue Terrace.

2531
03:09:25,093 --> 03:09:32,279
I have a few things I'd like to note that, first, the amount of time that I've lived in Medford is irrelevant.

2532
03:09:33,413 --> 03:09:33,533
that.

2533
03:09:34,093 --> 03:09:51,662
Second, I would like to highlight that in, and I am by no means an expert in this area, but in social justice work we are often reminded that it is important to own your impact rather than your intention.

2534
03:09:51,982 --> 03:09:53,763
Impact over intention always.

2535
03:09:54,764 --> 03:09:56,445
And what has been absent from

2536
03:10:01,782 --> 03:10:05,924
is any sense of ownership over the impact that you've had.

2537
03:10:06,325 --> 03:10:10,347
So I just wanted to put that out there as my observation.

2538
03:10:10,367 --> 03:10:16,831
I would also like to say something very uncomfortable.

2539
03:10:18,081 --> 03:10:44,812
But I think that because there have been a couple of mentions about how way back at the start of the meeting, it was suggested that a part of the reason that this discussion over access to the meeting came about was because of a school committee meeting and how that and the school committee meeting that was referenced, I'm assuming is the one where the vote was taken to change the name of the Columbus school.

2540
03:10:46,052 --> 03:11:00,874
And what's really relevant about that is that that meeting happened at a time when in the country, more than ever before, Black people's voices are being listened to, people of color are being listened to, and they are speaking up.

2541
03:11:01,515 --> 03:11:30,425
And when there are calls that say, suddenly there's all of this discord, suddenly there's all of this divide, it comes across as a little tone deaf to say that suddenly when people of color are raising their voices to be heard and saying that they have had an experience where Medford hasn't always been a happy place for them, and it hasn't always been good, calls to get back to the way things were before,

2542
03:11:32,806 --> 03:11:35,906
tone-deaf, and more importantly, they invalidate their experiences.

2543
03:11:36,607 --> 03:11:49,850
So I just wanted to mention that it would be really wise to give a little bit more consideration to the language that you're using and also to the voices that are at the table.

2544
03:11:50,271 --> 03:11:56,112
I realize that's nothing to do with the budget, but at the same time, everything to do with the budget because context really, really matters.

2545
03:11:56,993 --> 03:11:57,333
Thank you.

2546
03:11:57,913 --> 03:11:58,293
Thank you.

2547
03:11:59,605 --> 03:12:07,049
Let's see, Eileen Lerner, name and address for the record, please.

2548
03:12:07,630 --> 03:12:14,854
My name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford, and I'd just like to say that

2549
03:12:15,807 --> 03:12:22,088
I think this is the greatest demonstration of democracy that I've seen since I've been in Medford.

2550
03:12:24,289 --> 03:12:44,594
And I just wanna say, I'm really alarmed by some, the missing counselors having, kind of alluding, creating innuendo that this group of people are trying to take over Medford and we're trying to,

2551
03:12:45,854 --> 03:12:48,495
And we are creating this divide.

2552
03:12:48,916 --> 03:12:57,640
And I just have to say, you guys, you have to understand the divide has always been here between white and people of color.

2553
03:12:57,960 --> 03:13:02,082
The divide has always been here between men and women.

2554
03:13:02,663 --> 03:13:12,028
I mean, the way you've treated Nicole this evening is disgraceful as far as I'm concerned, even though you have very beautiful eyes too, Adam.

2555
03:13:12,888 --> 03:13:15,049
You know, it's just not right.

2556
03:13:15,690 --> 03:13:17,030
It's just not right.

2557
03:13:17,450 --> 03:13:19,912
And to say that we're creating the divide.

2558
03:13:19,972 --> 03:13:22,553
No, we are recognizing the divide.

2559
03:13:22,973 --> 03:13:27,616
And what we're doing is we're saying we have to do something about this divide.

2560
03:13:28,136 --> 03:13:29,997
We want to bring people together.

2561
03:13:30,277 --> 03:13:32,038
People have never been together.

2562
03:13:32,378 --> 03:13:34,599
For you to say, oh, we've been together.

2563
03:13:34,900 --> 03:13:38,962
Who has it been that you're talking about that's so happy?

2564
03:13:39,362 --> 03:13:41,303
You know, since I came to Medford,

2565
03:13:42,083 --> 03:13:48,704
I've encountered racism and antisemitism on a scale that just floored me.

2566
03:13:49,065 --> 03:14:00,387
Fortunately, I was protected from it in my previous town, which I won't mention, but don't say that we're trying to divide people.

2567
03:14:00,427 --> 03:14:08,989
We're trying to bring people together, but we want to address some of the systemic problems that have existed forever in Medford.

2568
03:14:10,729 --> 03:14:11,089
Thank you.

2569
03:14:14,787 --> 03:14:18,531
Let's see, Will Navarre.

2570
03:14:19,732 --> 03:14:21,113
Name and address for the record, please.

2571
03:14:23,035 --> 03:14:29,081
William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

2572
03:14:29,602 --> 03:14:35,167
President Falco, members of the council, I believe strongly in the politics of reason.

2573
03:14:36,160 --> 03:14:44,708
I believe that most good policies that address root causes ultimately are agreeable to most people once we've addressed people's needs through discussion.

2574
03:14:46,930 --> 03:14:59,601
You all know that I come before the council on a regular basis to suggest eliminating mandatory parking minimums and moving more of the tax burden onto land so as not to discourage development that would provide housing and jobs.

2575
03:15:01,354 --> 03:15:04,035
I don't try to summon a massive crowd for that.

2576
03:15:04,515 --> 03:15:07,435
I don't need to threaten anyone's job to make my points.

2577
03:15:08,236 --> 03:15:11,356
I don't need to threaten to withhold votes or get others to do so.

2578
03:15:11,376 --> 03:15:23,819
I worry that when we get to the point where a quorum of members is preventing a meeting happening, that feels like we're going away from the politics of reason, going into the politics of power.

2579
03:15:23,839 --> 03:15:30,621
And I think the reaction, this mass showing of constituents is really intended to show

2580
03:15:31,797 --> 03:15:33,799
a show of force, a show of political power.

2581
03:15:33,819 --> 03:15:41,766
And I ultimately worry this harms our ability to discuss and deliberate and problem solve as a community going forward.

2582
03:15:43,267 --> 03:15:48,732
I'm very happy to see all these participants and it makes me proud to be an American and proud to live in Medford.

2583
03:15:49,833 --> 03:15:54,717
But what I hope is that this does not set a precedent that we show up as a show of power.

2584
03:15:54,737 --> 03:15:58,541
I think that was necessary today.

2585
03:16:00,421 --> 03:16:03,284
but I hope my fellow Zoom participants will keep showing up.

2586
03:16:04,345 --> 03:16:11,532
Not to threaten our counselors at the ballot box, but rather to put our heads together and solve the five emergencies that face the city of Medford.

2587
03:16:13,494 --> 03:16:19,300
I've spoken before of a trifecta of emergencies that the city faces.

2588
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:24,145
I've said we face a housing, traffic, environmental emergency.

2589
03:16:26,587 --> 03:16:28,128
I gotta now add two more.

2590
03:16:28,188 --> 03:16:31,690
We face a racism emergency and a COVID-19 emergency.

2591
03:16:31,710 --> 03:16:34,631
That makes five.

2592
03:16:35,132 --> 03:16:36,552
Five emergencies we face.

2593
03:16:38,714 --> 03:16:42,015
Let's not add a dysfunctional city government to the mix.

2594
03:16:44,137 --> 03:16:55,023
I hope that members and constituents help prevent that by making sure we primarily put our heads together and deliberate rather than try to exert power over one another.

2595
03:16:55,503 --> 03:16:55,823
Thank you.

2596
03:16:56,905 --> 03:16:57,485
Thank you, Will.

2597
03:16:59,866 --> 03:17:03,866
Let's see.

2598
03:17:03,966 --> 03:17:05,967
Kelly Cunha, I don't think you've gone yet.

2599
03:17:06,087 --> 03:17:08,087
Let's see, name and address for the record, Kelly.

2600
03:17:09,087 --> 03:17:12,628
Hi, my name is Kelly Cunha, and I live at 20 Walter Street.

2601
03:17:14,368 --> 03:17:20,589
A lot of what I wanted to say has been said, so I'm not gonna repeat, although I do wanna elevate some of the voices I heard.

2602
03:17:20,909 --> 03:17:23,950
And I just wanted to say that there's a lot of talk about

2603
03:17:25,503 --> 03:17:30,128
certain groups and things calling discord and I just, you know, want to really call attention to that.

2604
03:17:31,570 --> 03:17:40,800
Just because somebody's experience has not matched your own lived experience does not invalidate it and I think that that's a really important thing because I think people are calling

2605
03:17:41,300 --> 03:17:46,706
people are trying to say this is like an us versus them, but in reality, we don't all have the same lived reality.

2606
03:17:46,746 --> 03:17:51,011
And I think it's really important for the council people to really listen to all the perspectives.

2607
03:17:51,391 --> 03:17:59,660
And when you're talking about a certain group of people trying to cause discord, I have been on this call for a couple hours, and I have seen nothing but

2608
03:18:00,904 --> 03:18:03,586
some tone policing by some of the council people.

2609
03:18:03,806 --> 03:18:18,255
I've seen people trying to ask really respectfully worded questions, really genuine questions and being responded to in a way that, you know, this is my first city council meeting, shame on me for that, but I promise I'll be back.

2610
03:18:19,189 --> 03:18:21,972
I cannot believe how people are speaking to the constituents.

2611
03:18:22,032 --> 03:18:45,733
It's actually it's i'm literally this is like reality tv to me Um, so I just wanted to say that we need to really think about how we speak to people Listen to the experiences even if it's not your own lived experience And also really, you know, let's educate ourselves about how you know If you're not sure about something maybe talk to those people instead of talking about them on a on a call like this

2612
03:18:46,233 --> 03:18:50,457
I've found people are really open to these discussions right now.

2613
03:18:50,537 --> 03:18:53,360
So educate yourselves and thank you very much.

2614
03:18:54,181 --> 03:18:54,801
Thank you, Kelly.

2615
03:18:56,323 --> 03:19:01,628
Let's see, we have Ari Freitag.

2616
03:19:02,348 --> 03:19:10,456
Ari, name and address of the record, please.

2617
03:19:11,128 --> 03:19:16,030
Hi, everybody, I'm Ari Fritig, 6th Street, apartment 3 in Medford.

2618
03:19:17,850 --> 03:19:24,652
I just wanted to say, to pipe up to say it's now 10.23 at night, and I love my community so much right now.

2619
03:19:25,133 --> 03:19:29,054
I've lived in Medford since 2012, although as somebody else said that that shouldn't matter.

2620
03:19:29,874 --> 03:19:32,195
So many people are coming forward to make their voice heard.

2621
03:19:32,715 --> 03:19:40,419
Here we are, it's almost 10.30, and there's still, I think, over 220 people on the Zoom.

2622
03:19:40,459 --> 03:19:41,999
That is really incredible.

2623
03:19:42,660 --> 03:19:47,802
And in the interest of unity, I want to get at a few points that it sounds like we all agree on.

2624
03:19:48,282 --> 03:19:55,225
It sounds like we all agree that we want the city council meetings to be as accessible as possible for everyone and as many people as possible.

2625
03:19:55,746 --> 03:19:58,327
We all want to pass a budget as quickly as possible.

2626
03:19:58,767 --> 03:20:00,488
We all want to do right by the whole community.

2627
03:20:01,385 --> 03:20:10,355
But I want to echo the person who said that the four city councilors need to consider their impact of their actions over their intent and want to build on that point.

2628
03:20:10,936 --> 03:20:21,148
I have no doubt that their intentions are good from their perspective, but the impact of their actions were that hundreds of their fellow citizens were waiting for them to show up, but they did not show up without a statement.

2629
03:20:21,888 --> 03:20:28,291
The impact was that it delayed the budget process that we all want to pass, and now we're up against a harder deadline.

2630
03:20:28,751 --> 03:20:41,136
The impact of that was that one person said that tonight was his statement, but that absence let others draw their own conclusions, which added to the divisiveness that he himself railed against.

2631
03:20:42,076 --> 03:20:56,689
So finally, I just want to echo also what I think it was Sophie Rick said it is up to the city council to be responsible and follow public health guidance and to say, you know, when somebody wants to have a meeting in person, especially if it's going to be over 10 people.

2632
03:20:57,510 --> 03:21:02,953
that doesn't follow public health, the best public health practices.

2633
03:21:03,713 --> 03:21:14,779
There's been so many points that have been made that I agree with, that I can't get them all, but I think it is for public officials to do what is in the best interest of the public health and the community as a whole.

2634
03:21:15,119 --> 03:21:17,680
And that's what I haven't seen from those four city councilors.

2635
03:21:17,740 --> 03:21:19,641
And I just wanted to let people know that.

2636
03:21:19,901 --> 03:21:20,221
Thank you.

2637
03:21:20,622 --> 03:21:21,002
Thank you.

2638
03:21:22,362 --> 03:21:25,324
Giles Hall, name and address for the record, please.

2639
03:21:28,461 --> 03:21:30,543
Hi, my name is Giles Hall.

2640
03:21:30,663 --> 03:21:33,225
I live at 13 Albion Street in Metro.

2641
03:21:34,466 --> 03:21:41,512
And I want to thank all the councillors and everybody else who has participated in this meeting tonight.

2642
03:21:44,095 --> 03:21:55,084
And I think that what I really just wanted to comment about was that I believe and I understand this meeting is recorded and that

2643
03:21:56,769 --> 03:22:20,628
since Zoom seems to be something that's going to be in our future, that it may benefit the conversation for the counselors to go back and look at this recording and consider things like, you know, did they, how much time did you spend speaking versus whether you just listened and, you know, whether you interrupted people,

2644
03:22:21,848 --> 03:22:23,910
first, quite honestly, whether you interrupted people.

2645
03:22:24,010 --> 03:22:33,857
And also, if there was a gender bias to those interruptions, it all matters.

2646
03:22:34,437 --> 03:22:35,078
It all matters.

2647
03:22:36,299 --> 03:22:48,668
And I just, I'm thoughtful that what I'm hearing a lot about is, you know, I know that it has to be a hard job being a city councilor, but at the same time, I'm hearing a lot about

2648
03:22:49,862 --> 03:22:57,443
personal stories of their experiences in a way that it's just not connecting in my mind with what's going on right now.

2649
03:22:58,223 --> 03:23:13,226
And so I'm just, I'm thoughtful that there's a lot of subtext and informative lessons in this meeting that are worth going over and thinking about how the person might've felt on the other side of what might've been said.

2650
03:23:14,126 --> 03:23:19,007
And hopefully that can be a path towards having more productive Zoom meetings going forward.

2651
03:23:20,546 --> 03:23:34,917
And to the gentleman who spoke who mentioned that his parents have COVID, I really hope for you and your family that you have a safe recovery.

2652
03:23:34,957 --> 03:23:36,278
And I'm really sorry to hear that.

2653
03:23:38,660 --> 03:23:41,302
And thank you very much for this opportunity to speak.

2654
03:23:42,302 --> 03:23:42,943
Thank you, Giles.

2655
03:23:55,768 --> 03:23:56,708
Nadine Moretti.

2656
03:23:57,128 --> 03:23:58,389
Name and address of the record, please.

2657
03:24:02,350 --> 03:24:03,491
Hi, President Falgo.

2658
03:24:03,511 --> 03:24:04,731
Thank you for letting me speak.

2659
03:24:05,051 --> 03:24:08,372
My name is Nadine Moretti, and I live at 126 Birgit Ave.

2660
03:24:10,013 --> 03:24:10,513
Can you hear me?

2661
03:24:10,953 --> 03:24:11,473
Yes, I can.

2662
03:24:11,633 --> 03:24:11,893
Oh, OK.

2663
03:24:11,993 --> 03:24:12,794
Sorry, I wasn't sure.

2664
03:24:12,934 --> 03:24:14,274
I had a little trouble for a minute.

2665
03:24:15,895 --> 03:24:20,896
I just want to say, I mean, this has been three and a half hours I signed on, as we all have.

2666
03:24:20,976 --> 03:24:22,957
So thank you, everybody, for all this time.

2667
03:24:23,896 --> 03:24:26,919
I think that this meeting has been extremely uncomfortable.

2668
03:24:27,100 --> 03:24:28,721
I mean, the hostility is palpable.

2669
03:24:30,583 --> 03:24:31,785
I've listened to what everybody said.

2670
03:24:31,805 --> 03:24:37,771
It's been a lot of reiterating the same points because a lot of people have the same feelings and that's definitely understood.

2671
03:24:37,791 --> 03:24:43,438
I voted for the four counselors who chose to

2672
03:24:45,645 --> 03:24:48,767
you know, not show up for the reasons that they spoke of.

2673
03:24:48,907 --> 03:24:51,469
And I had no problem with that.

2674
03:24:51,549 --> 03:24:53,570
I fully supported why they were doing it.

2675
03:24:53,610 --> 03:24:55,612
I don't think they're trying to put anybody in danger.

2676
03:24:55,632 --> 03:25:01,475
This COVID-19 is unprecedented and we've all been stuck in the house and everything has changed.

2677
03:25:02,156 --> 03:25:05,698
I've had an ill parent that we've had to keep isolated the whole time.

2678
03:25:05,718 --> 03:25:07,419
And that has been really difficult.

2679
03:25:08,760 --> 03:25:09,841
I think Zoom is,

2680
03:25:11,187 --> 03:25:11,467
I don't know.

2681
03:25:11,487 --> 03:25:12,007
I think it's half and half.

2682
03:25:12,027 --> 03:25:13,188
It's effective and ineffective.

2683
03:25:13,228 --> 03:25:15,009
It's ineffective for many, many ways.

2684
03:25:15,750 --> 03:25:18,591
And I'm never comfortable public speaking on here.

2685
03:25:18,811 --> 03:25:21,132
I'm so uncomfortable, but I figured I had to speak.

2686
03:25:22,213 --> 03:25:29,217
Um, I just think it's disheartening to see the way people have spoken to the counselors about the counselors on both sides.

2687
03:25:29,897 --> 03:25:31,318
The four and then the other three.

2688
03:25:31,418 --> 03:25:32,279
I just think it's been.

2689
03:25:33,299 --> 03:25:33,619
It's been a

2690
03:25:39,034 --> 03:25:40,415
Thank everybody for their work.

2691
03:25:40,555 --> 03:25:46,080
I think that the four counselors are not trying to not do their jobs and they deserve their jobs.

2692
03:25:47,501 --> 03:25:53,045
I think that speaking, I guess since we're speaking about the police, I fully support the police because they protect us.

2693
03:25:53,846 --> 03:26:04,294
And if my husband or my brother or my father was a policeman and put their job on the line every day, I would not want to see anything taken away from them in that manner.

2694
03:26:04,354 --> 03:26:07,437
I just can't understand that, the police being taken out of the schools.

2695
03:26:07,457 --> 03:26:08,658
And I didn't even want to touch on this.

2696
03:26:09,468 --> 03:26:14,671
I've been to a couple of council meetings in person and they've been great.

2697
03:26:14,871 --> 03:26:18,933
I don't think that it would have been this hostile if we were in person.

2698
03:26:19,293 --> 03:26:29,998
I could be wrong, but I mean, I think that everybody deserves to speak and they did, but I think that the hostility has just been, it's been so, it's just been upsetting.

2699
03:26:30,218 --> 03:26:35,221
And I just hope that it doesn't continue, especially in the city, because it's completely out of hand.

2700
03:26:36,372 --> 03:26:43,895
President Falco and all the councilors, thank you for your time sitting here for what will be four and a half, five hours of your night away from your families.

2701
03:26:44,155 --> 03:26:46,597
And thank you for your patience.

2702
03:26:46,797 --> 03:26:51,159
You guys and women all conduct yourselves pretty well.

2703
03:26:51,379 --> 03:26:55,761
And again, I still stand behind my councilors that I voted for, so I just want them to know that.

2704
03:26:56,581 --> 03:26:57,361
And thank you so much.

2705
03:26:57,942 --> 03:26:58,582
Thank you, Nadine.

2706
03:26:58,942 --> 03:26:59,562
You're very welcome.

2707
03:26:59,582 --> 03:27:05,645
Let's see, we have John D'Orazio.

2708
03:27:06,571 --> 03:27:08,212
Name and address for the record, John D'Orazio.

2709
03:27:12,234 --> 03:27:13,394
John, hang on, you're muted.

2710
03:27:16,215 --> 03:27:16,435
Okay.

2711
03:27:17,736 --> 03:27:18,977
Thanks, President Falco.

2712
03:27:19,937 --> 03:27:21,578
John D'Orazio, 10 Headland Way.

2713
03:27:21,598 --> 03:27:26,680
I just wanted to echo some of what Nadine was saying.

2714
03:27:26,700 --> 03:27:28,761
I'm extremely proud of the council tonight.

2715
03:27:28,821 --> 03:27:30,842
I mean, we're 1030 at night, you guys.

2716
03:27:31,670 --> 03:27:37,944
definitely bit off more than you bargained for in terms of where we're at with COVID and having to deal with that.

2717
03:27:38,004 --> 03:27:39,728
I think, you know, communication is key.

2718
03:27:39,768 --> 03:27:41,552
I think one of the counselors said earlier on,

2719
03:27:42,147 --> 03:27:49,212
there might have been some communication around you know what you could do virtual versus non-virtual etc I can understand that.

2720
03:27:49,873 --> 03:28:07,005
I think it's important to have a setting where you do have non-virtual maybe for the council but then also certainly Zoom is very effective although I will say 250 people I think people have been talking about that that's really a small percentage of the city of Medford so I don't know that we've

2721
03:28:07,545 --> 03:28:09,166
kind of even scraped the surface.

2722
03:28:10,526 --> 03:28:12,247
I did vote for most of the council.

2723
03:28:12,307 --> 03:28:18,549
I would say I did vote for the four folks that abstained from the budget meetings.

2724
03:28:18,689 --> 03:28:23,311
And while it created a bit of controversy, I think in their minds, they had an idea, they shared those.

2725
03:28:23,791 --> 03:28:25,012
I think people do need to

2726
03:28:25,672 --> 03:28:30,815
step up their respect game for the council in terms of they donate a lot of time to the city.

2727
03:28:32,036 --> 03:28:34,677
It's not a wealthy position, I don't think.

2728
03:28:34,817 --> 03:28:37,419
So, you know, in terms of income.

2729
03:28:37,459 --> 03:28:39,820
So I think they do it out of the goodness of the city.

2730
03:28:39,840 --> 03:28:43,902
And I think people, when they have complaints, need to do it in a respectful way.

2731
03:28:43,922 --> 03:28:51,207
I did hear some rhetoric that probably wasn't appropriate, but given the times we have, I will say I attended the racial

2732
03:28:52,833 --> 03:29:13,448
uh equality meetings that we had as part of the city that the mayor held and and I was extremely proud of the city um as part of that zoom conference like it was it showed a lot of the diversity of Medford people had a lot of good ideas um you know tonight's meeting kind of probably set us back a little bit with some attitudes but um i'm proud of you guys you know john george

2733
03:29:14,312 --> 03:29:18,895
Councilor Marks, I think you guys represent the city well.

2734
03:29:20,436 --> 03:29:24,058
Councilor Knight, and I understand why you took the stance you did.

2735
03:29:24,098 --> 03:29:30,021
It did create a bit of controversy, but I think we'll work through it and you guys will get the budget in on time.

2736
03:29:30,341 --> 03:29:31,942
So I appreciate all your efforts.

2737
03:29:33,143 --> 03:29:33,683
Thank you, John.

2738
03:29:36,564 --> 03:29:39,026
Paul Rousseau, name and address for the record, please.

2739
03:29:40,363 --> 03:29:43,645
Thank you, Paul Rousseau, 22 Orchard Street, Massachusetts.

2740
03:29:44,386 --> 03:29:46,347
I'm on the Medford School Committee.

2741
03:29:48,048 --> 03:29:49,609
I'd first like to speak as a father.

2742
03:29:49,629 --> 03:30:00,616
I don't appreciate the dismissive tone, the threats that I and other school committee members have received over the last 10 days, not to mention the threat to the Columbus School itself.

2743
03:30:01,597 --> 03:30:09,862
The level of vitriol from some members of our community border on inciting violence, and that includes some comments from people that are on this Zoom meeting right now.

2744
03:30:10,981 --> 03:30:11,682
Words matter.

2745
03:30:11,722 --> 03:30:13,743
They are the weapons of a civilized society.

2746
03:30:13,763 --> 03:30:25,211
And I suggest we keep them to words and not actually requiring the police to be visiting my home several times a day, which they do now, as they do to all the homes of the school committee members.

2747
03:30:29,094 --> 03:30:35,078
Finally, as a father, I don't appreciate that these threats have forced me to have to have some uncomfortable conversations with my children and my husband.

2748
03:30:35,399 --> 03:30:39,121
I also, as a Medford resident for 15 years, not that it matters, I agree.

2749
03:30:40,948 --> 03:30:42,829
I've never really even locked my front door.

2750
03:30:43,290 --> 03:30:45,011
Now my doors are locked at all times.

2751
03:30:45,932 --> 03:30:52,056
And I just want to say that is the Medford that I think I actually live in, not the one that I thought I lived in.

2752
03:30:53,838 --> 03:30:55,899
So now I'm going to speak quickly as a school committee member.

2753
03:30:55,919 --> 03:30:58,341
And I have a few thoughts about what I've heard here tonight.

2754
03:31:00,280 --> 03:31:05,462
I find it, first of all, I just want to find it amusing that anybody thinks a three and a half hour meeting is even remotely long.

2755
03:31:05,862 --> 03:31:08,384
School committee meetings are eight hours on a regular basis.

2756
03:31:08,604 --> 03:31:10,184
So I just kind of giggle at that.

2757
03:31:10,204 --> 03:31:11,265
So I'm kind of light.

2758
03:31:12,606 --> 03:31:17,848
But anyways, when I took office, I had heard from several members of the council,

2759
03:31:18,964 --> 03:31:22,525
The school committee shouldn't be in the city council's pool and we shouldn't be in yours.

2760
03:31:22,966 --> 03:31:24,786
And I fully support that.

2761
03:31:25,287 --> 03:31:30,909
I agree both bodies have enough work to do without also trying to be involved in each other's work.

2762
03:31:32,430 --> 03:31:35,571
If you look at the budgets for the last decade, you'll see an org chart.

2763
03:31:36,131 --> 03:31:39,312
The mayor, the city council and the school committee are all on the same level.

2764
03:31:39,573 --> 03:31:40,693
We don't report to each other.

2765
03:31:42,394 --> 03:31:45,295
So why am I speaking then at a city council meeting?

2766
03:31:46,538 --> 03:31:53,441
because I've heard several times tonight about the school committee meeting from counselors either directly or indirectly.

2767
03:31:54,461 --> 03:31:56,502
So here's what I have to say on some of those comments.

2768
03:31:57,802 --> 03:32:02,844
The school committee does not have taxation authority or the ability to decide how much money we are given.

2769
03:32:03,284 --> 03:32:05,325
That is the job of the city council and the mayor.

2770
03:32:06,403 --> 03:32:11,427
So when you talk about the layoffs in the school department, I take offense- For your information, Mr. President.

2771
03:32:11,487 --> 03:32:13,029
For your information, Councilor Marks.

2772
03:32:13,549 --> 03:32:19,974
Just for the edification of the gentlemen, the city council does not decide the money that's given to the school committee.

2773
03:32:20,715 --> 03:32:24,178
Just to, you know, if we're gonna talk facts, let's talk facts.

2774
03:32:25,479 --> 03:32:27,601
Thank you, so I won't respond to that.

2775
03:32:29,022 --> 03:32:30,203
Because there is none, Paul.

2776
03:32:31,412 --> 03:32:32,974
That's right, you don't have to approve our budget.

2777
03:32:33,295 --> 03:32:33,695
That's right.

2778
03:32:34,376 --> 03:32:36,239
You don't approve- That's not what you said, Paul.

2779
03:32:36,479 --> 03:32:38,221
Let's get the facts, what you're saying, Paul.

2780
03:32:38,482 --> 03:32:39,543
Facts matter, Paul.

2781
03:32:39,784 --> 03:32:43,369
You can't just speak and not- One at a time.

2782
03:32:43,489 --> 03:32:44,811
Councilor Marks has the floor.

2783
03:32:44,951 --> 03:32:46,132
Councilor Marks has the floor.

2784
03:32:46,913 --> 03:32:49,994
Mr. President, facts speak for themselves, Mr. President.

2785
03:32:50,014 --> 03:32:54,435
The gentleman can't accept that that is not the process, Mr. President.

2786
03:32:54,715 --> 03:32:58,416
And he's been saying a lot of things that aren't processed over the last couple of weeks.

2787
03:32:58,876 --> 03:33:01,057
He should know what the process is, Mr. President.

2788
03:33:01,377 --> 03:33:01,977
You are correct.

2789
03:33:05,138 --> 03:33:07,838
I take offense and disagree that we are laying anyone off.

2790
03:33:08,018 --> 03:33:09,599
The city is laying staff off.

2791
03:33:10,079 --> 03:33:14,020
Literally every school committee member, and I would suggest everyone that's ever served,

2792
03:33:14,625 --> 03:33:16,686
would add dozens of personnel every year.

2793
03:33:16,967 --> 03:33:20,049
So pinning this on the school committee is unacceptable, in my opinion.

2794
03:33:22,130 --> 03:33:29,035
Next, I would like to discuss the renaming of the Columbus School directly and the assertion that this has divided this community.

2795
03:33:29,435 --> 03:33:30,856
I greatly appreciate the quote.

2796
03:33:31,677 --> 03:33:42,745
Any time anyone says, we've never been more divided about a country that was legally segregated within many of its current citizens' lifetimes, I guess at least

2797
03:33:43,954 --> 03:33:46,175
They're making it clear who their we is.

2798
03:33:46,935 --> 03:33:49,296
Medford was redlining not very long ago.

2799
03:33:49,897 --> 03:33:55,459
The boundaries of neighborhoods were carefully drawn to make sure as few black kids as possible would go to school with white kids.

2800
03:33:55,819 --> 03:33:58,080
And that is not before I was born.

2801
03:33:59,221 --> 03:34:02,242
Medford has not been united, never has been.

2802
03:34:03,543 --> 03:34:12,727
And I think that using that Medford as this united thing, it's just, it's crap, frankly, pardon my language.

2803
03:34:16,448 --> 03:34:21,190
I also want to say that I look forward to responding to any open meeting law violations that are filed against me.

2804
03:34:21,770 --> 03:34:29,052
I have attended open meeting law trainings three years in a row as a school committee member during the school committee associations trainings.

2805
03:34:29,633 --> 03:34:31,553
And I'm pretty confident on my interpretation.

2806
03:34:32,614 --> 03:34:38,796
If you ask my colleagues on the school committee, they will all tell you that I'm obsessed with the open meeting law and following the process.

2807
03:34:39,736 --> 03:34:44,878
I've received a call today from a senior member asking me a question about open meeting law.

2808
03:34:46,169 --> 03:35:05,590
to have this body say anything about transparency when it was normal, if not on every meeting, if it was normal, if not on every meeting for up to 75 years, according to one of the members during their debate on this, that they would just add items to the agenda when they showed up.

2809
03:35:06,523 --> 03:35:13,887
both in violation of the open meeting law and the opposite of transparency and access that I've heard a few things about tonight.

2810
03:35:14,368 --> 03:35:18,130
So you just show up, add stuff to the agenda, talk about it, and the public hasn't got a clue.

2811
03:35:19,470 --> 03:35:28,636
After I filed my open meeting law violation, this body had a meeting to discuss the fact that the city solicitor had agreed that you all cannot do that.

2812
03:35:29,756 --> 03:35:35,720
And finally, apparently after 75 years, you don't just add stuff to the agenda when you walk in the room or show up to your meetings.

2813
03:35:38,980 --> 03:35:41,361
I recommend that folks go back and look at that meeting.

2814
03:35:41,401 --> 03:35:42,321
It was earlier this year.

2815
03:35:42,721 --> 03:35:50,983
There were some members that were shocked, utterly shocked, and had intense disagreement that this opinion from the city solicitor was accurate.

2816
03:35:52,483 --> 03:35:56,844
So I will not accept any critiques on transparency, access, or process from this body.

2817
03:35:58,005 --> 03:35:58,345
Thank you.

2818
03:36:00,005 --> 03:36:00,365
Thank you.

2819
03:36:03,026 --> 03:36:03,386
Thank you.

2820
03:36:07,367 --> 03:36:07,887
Council Knight.

2821
03:36:08,565 --> 03:36:09,246
I'd like to speak.

2822
03:36:09,586 --> 03:36:10,687
Oh, I'm sorry, Councilor Knight.

2823
03:36:12,249 --> 03:36:18,635
Mr. President, I'm going to have to excuse myself for about 10 or 15 minutes because I got to put my kids to bed at this point in time.

2824
03:36:19,515 --> 03:36:24,420
So I will be back, but I'm not going to be around for the next 10 minutes just so I can take care of this.

2825
03:36:24,981 --> 03:36:26,662
Councilor Knight, thank you for notifying us.

2826
03:36:26,983 --> 03:36:29,165
I apologize, but duty calls.

2827
03:36:29,983 --> 03:36:31,064
Thank you for notifying us.

2828
03:36:32,204 --> 03:36:35,625
Jacqueline Furtado, name and address for the record.

2829
03:36:36,146 --> 03:36:38,026
Actually, I'm sorry, you don't have the hand up.

2830
03:36:38,147 --> 03:36:39,167
I apologize.

2831
03:36:39,587 --> 03:36:41,468
Paul Camuso, name and address for the record.

2832
03:36:45,509 --> 03:36:47,050
Thank you, President Falco.

2833
03:36:47,730 --> 03:36:49,751
I know it's been a long evening for all.

2834
03:36:50,191 --> 03:36:53,893
Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road here in Medford.

2835
03:36:54,273 --> 03:36:58,015
But thank you for calling on me, Mr. President Falco.

2836
03:36:59,015 --> 03:37:06,879
I speak from my experience as a member of the school committee and as a city councilor for about 16 years here in our community.

2837
03:37:08,360 --> 03:37:10,921
First of all, the budget that we received, I want to thank the mayor.

2838
03:37:11,921 --> 03:37:12,542
Read it online.

2839
03:37:13,562 --> 03:37:19,267
It's got a lot of information, a total overhaul of budgets of years past.

2840
03:37:19,867 --> 03:37:23,491
And I'm glad that it was presented in the format that it was.

2841
03:37:23,551 --> 03:37:26,493
I think it's a great collaboration from all the department heads.

2842
03:37:27,274 --> 03:37:29,816
The narratives were great and the charts and things of that nature.

2843
03:37:31,177 --> 03:37:40,185
But as far as the discussion that's going on regarding meeting in Zoom and meeting in the council chambers,

2844
03:37:41,040 --> 03:37:46,544
I absolutely understand that there is a lot of value in meeting at the council chambers.

2845
03:37:47,445 --> 03:37:56,672
You know, yeah, when you have to look people in the eye on tough debates and things of that nature, and quite honestly, after watching this meeting,

2846
03:37:57,159 --> 03:38:02,981
and some other meetings that are on Zoom, the decorum, the Robert's Rules of Order are in place for a reason.

2847
03:38:03,341 --> 03:38:13,405
And it's a lot easier to keep an orderly meeting, I think, if you're at a public meeting rather than on Zoom, just because the technology is a little bit different.

2848
03:38:14,385 --> 03:38:18,526
But like I said, I do not envy any of you guys during this COVID time.

2849
03:38:19,107 --> 03:38:28,370
This city has stepped up amazingly, the city council, the mayor's office, the school department, everybody, to meet the needs of the people in our community with this COVID-19.

2850
03:38:28,750 --> 03:38:31,591
It's unprecedented, as we all know.

2851
03:38:32,071 --> 03:38:38,933
And I think that somewhere along the line, and I really got to credit the entire council tonight

2852
03:38:39,415 --> 03:38:40,416
for the motion that was made.

2853
03:38:40,436 --> 03:38:43,280
I believe it's basically for like a mediation with the mayor.

2854
03:38:43,320 --> 03:38:50,669
I don't know if that's the correct word to use, but Marianne O'Connor, who I've had the privilege of knowing over the years, she is a consummate professional.

2855
03:38:51,142 --> 03:38:55,104
and as well as the members of the school committee, the council, the mayor's office.

2856
03:38:55,764 --> 03:38:58,785
If there's a way to do a hybrid model, I think it would be the best.

2857
03:38:59,906 --> 03:39:09,550
Just because of the fact, like you said, people can have both, you can come down there if your health allows you to, and you can also participate on Zoom.

2858
03:39:09,810 --> 03:39:14,311
The one good thing that I am encouraged by this evening is the participation, but

2859
03:39:15,712 --> 03:39:24,095
The name calling and stuff that was allowed to happen tonight on all sides of this issue, it's not Medford that we can be proud of, to be quite frank.

2860
03:39:24,535 --> 03:39:29,616
We should all be working together to move Medford forward in a way that we all love Medford.

2861
03:39:29,917 --> 03:39:33,778
Whether you've been here for a hundred years or you've been here for a hundred days, it doesn't matter.

2862
03:39:33,978 --> 03:39:37,439
You moved here because you like something in this community and it can always be better.

2863
03:39:38,052 --> 03:39:38,952
It can always be better.

2864
03:39:40,193 --> 03:39:49,938
I suggest, like I said, I hope tomorrow Vice President Carviello, President Falco, with the mayor and other people can sit down and let cooler heads prevail.

2865
03:39:50,318 --> 03:39:59,543
One thing that has been frustrating on Zoom, just when I've watched it, is sometimes they have to call the roll three, four, five times to find out how people are voting and stuff.

2866
03:40:00,103 --> 03:40:02,084
The technology is iffy.

2867
03:40:02,904 --> 03:40:03,405
I understand

2868
03:40:04,714 --> 03:40:09,061
I understand that it's a good tool, but at the same token, it's something that can...

2869
03:40:10,413 --> 03:40:13,936
whether it's a slow internet connection on a specific night or something.

2870
03:40:14,416 --> 03:40:26,166
Um, it does, does can get challenging, you know, but, uh, for our community, for the Medford that we all love, let cooler heads prevail and, uh, let's get the budget and do it, uh, do it the right way.

2871
03:40:26,426 --> 03:40:30,109
And I, and I just would like to, uh, hopefully it's a hybrid if we can do it in a safe manner.

2872
03:40:30,630 --> 03:40:39,557
And, uh, as far as both sides of the issue, I understand, I understand both sides of the issue, but I cannot state loud enough the value of

2873
03:40:40,135 --> 03:40:43,698
having a meeting with people once it's safe to do so.

2874
03:40:44,359 --> 03:40:53,808
So I would encourage you, would strongly encourage you guys to try to do some sort of hybrid model, because this might be another year before we're out of the woods with COVID.

2875
03:40:55,609 --> 03:40:59,033
The numbers are going up and down as we see all over the country right now.

2876
03:40:59,413 --> 03:41:00,474
We don't know where we're gonna be.

2877
03:41:01,495 --> 03:41:04,378
The city has done a tremendous job getting the,

2878
03:41:05,590 --> 03:41:09,891
the PPE out there and things of that nature, working with the partners in federal and state government.

2879
03:41:10,271 --> 03:41:11,832
But we don't know where we're going down the road.

2880
03:41:12,512 --> 03:41:15,073
So people's individual needs can be met.

2881
03:41:15,273 --> 03:41:22,054
And I've always been a big person for meeting the individual needs of constituents as we all are when we're elected officials.

2882
03:41:22,434 --> 03:41:32,057
But if we have both, I think it would be the best because I think the decorum, most importantly, would be brought back to a place that we can all be proud of.

2883
03:41:33,325 --> 03:41:39,891
in a setting less virtual, but also virtual for the people that do have health needs that may need it.

2884
03:41:40,171 --> 03:41:41,732
So that's all I have tonight.

2885
03:41:42,113 --> 03:41:44,295
And once again, just good luck with this budget.

2886
03:41:44,675 --> 03:41:45,916
Budget time is never easy.

2887
03:41:46,620 --> 03:42:01,547
Back in early 2000, I was around when there was a serious budget crisis when you were on the school committee council, Falco, and we worked together and we did some unique things to make sure that we mitigated some of the funds that weren't there.

2888
03:42:01,987 --> 03:42:03,768
And we did that by working together.

2889
03:42:04,128 --> 03:42:06,869
We didn't do that by the school committee and the council, not seeing eye to eye.

2890
03:42:07,129 --> 03:42:08,470
We did that by working together.

2891
03:42:08,982 --> 03:42:10,863
And we were able to put out a product that was good.

2892
03:42:11,383 --> 03:42:13,184
And so that's all.

2893
03:42:13,644 --> 03:42:14,565
I miss all you guys.

2894
03:42:15,285 --> 03:42:16,025
And have a good night.

2895
03:42:16,546 --> 03:42:17,386
Good to see you, Paul.

2896
03:42:17,406 --> 03:42:18,126
Thank you very much.

2897
03:42:18,727 --> 03:42:19,167
Have a good night.

2898
03:42:19,187 --> 03:42:21,868
OK, let's see.

2899
03:42:22,228 --> 03:42:23,469
Rick Orlando has his hand up.

2900
03:42:23,909 --> 03:42:26,050
Rick Orlando, name and address for the record, please.

2901
03:42:26,670 --> 03:42:29,212
Rick Orlando, 13 Winford Way.

2902
03:42:30,972 --> 03:42:31,813
Some of you know me.

2903
03:42:32,013 --> 03:42:33,274
Probably most of you don't.

2904
03:42:34,652 --> 03:42:38,923
over the years I've had and time in Medford, as someone said, is irrelevant.

2905
03:42:41,007 --> 03:42:46,031
Everybody that comes to the city that I've met enjoys being here, and that's my experience.

2906
03:42:46,091 --> 03:42:48,673
I'm not disputing that other people have had other experiences.

2907
03:42:49,754 --> 03:42:57,860
Going back a number of years, and why I'm speaking is not so much about the meeting method, or that's for you folks to figure out, and so on.

2908
03:42:58,481 --> 03:43:06,187
But what disheartens me is there seems to be a theme of Medford has always been

2909
03:43:06,913 --> 03:43:07,993
a divided place.

2910
03:43:09,594 --> 03:43:16,937
I feel badly for what I heard Mr. Rousseau say about how he doesn't feel safe in his home, and I hope that nobody should feel like that.

2911
03:43:17,697 --> 03:43:19,138
And I feel badly about that.

2912
03:43:20,358 --> 03:43:31,803
But having had the experience of growing up here, I moved out for a little while, and having had the unique experience and pleasure of working on the New Schools Project back in No Longer New Schools,

2913
03:43:32,662 --> 03:43:44,886
back about 15 or 20 years ago now, I had the opportunity to meet thousands and thousands of people, probably as many as the counselors, just because of the nature of the work we did.

2914
03:43:45,727 --> 03:43:59,972
And that experience I had with those people, it fueled the committee's work on the schools, because the unity in the people for common cause, improving their family's life,

2915
03:44:01,055 --> 03:44:06,557
and having good experiences in Medford was just so rewarding to listen to.

2916
03:44:06,697 --> 03:44:11,799
And my experience, yes, it's my past experience, but I trust my instincts.

2917
03:44:12,239 --> 03:44:16,641
And when I meet people in the city, whether they're here as a new resident,

2918
03:44:17,600 --> 03:44:26,968
I get and I enjoy learning about them, their parents that might have been here, lived and met for years ago, and even their kids.

2919
03:44:26,988 --> 03:44:40,320
So I meet the grandparents, the parents, the kids, and I'm constantly making new friendships regardless of whether it's an old friend that I went to kindergarten with or whether it's a person that just moved two blocks away from me a year ago.

2920
03:44:41,362 --> 03:44:51,685
Uh, and so I won't go on much longer, but my experience, and I think it's experienced for a lot of people in Medford is that it's not a terrible place to live.

2921
03:44:52,265 --> 03:44:59,968
There have been a lot of good experiences, some amazing relationships, some amazing people that do outstanding work for their community.

2922
03:45:00,668 --> 03:45:09,231
And I just wish that people would take that into consideration when we hear some of the concerns people have on things we need to improve.

2923
03:45:10,031 --> 03:45:10,251
Thank you.

2924
03:45:11,253 --> 03:45:11,713
Thank you, Rick.

2925
03:45:13,634 --> 03:45:16,435
Michelle Scott, name and address for the record, please.

2926
03:45:17,936 --> 03:45:18,316
Good evening.

2927
03:45:18,356 --> 03:45:19,657
My name is Michelle Scott.

2928
03:45:19,817 --> 03:45:22,378
I live at 28 Essex Street in Ward 6.

2929
03:45:23,859 --> 03:45:24,899
Hopefully you can hear me.

2930
03:45:25,319 --> 03:45:30,722
I would like to thank you, Council President Falco and all the councilors tonight for your time and for

2931
03:45:31,239 --> 03:45:32,600
listening to people's input.

2932
03:45:33,801 --> 03:45:49,551
I just want to say that whatever format is ultimately decided for the budget hearings going forward, I hope there will be a quick prompt and thorough documentation of whatever protocols will be followed so individuals in the city can have

2933
03:45:50,520 --> 03:45:55,444
have the information they need to make the choice about what level of participation will work for them.

2934
03:45:55,704 --> 03:46:19,743
I still have a lot of concerns about attending in-person meetings, information about resources, masks, sanitation, cleaning procedures, separation, and also any way that the comments from people that may be participating virtually will be balanced in terms of time and sequence with the people participating in the room would all be really important to me.

2935
03:46:20,563 --> 03:46:34,575
And I hope that all members of the council, and I will communicate this to the mayor as well, will be attentive to all input offered through other means, be it email, phone calls that may take place outside of those hearings.

2936
03:46:34,996 --> 03:46:35,777
Thank you for your time.

2937
03:46:36,257 --> 03:46:36,777
Thank you.

2938
03:46:38,058 --> 03:46:39,099
Mr. President, if I can.

2939
03:46:39,400 --> 03:46:40,220
Councilor Scott Kelly.

2940
03:46:40,841 --> 03:46:43,183
Thank you, and I appreciate your comments, Michelle.

2941
03:46:44,824 --> 03:46:47,807
What I'd like to do is make it known that

2942
03:46:48,330 --> 03:46:55,211
I'm actively securing a disinfectant and cleaning company that works directly with COVID.

2943
03:46:56,008 --> 03:47:10,756
to work with ever format if we do decide to be in a location that's live, that they will disinfect before and after they will provide PPE for any participant that needs it and at no cost to the city.

2944
03:47:10,796 --> 03:47:22,822
So I just want you to know if it does happen that I've already made some moves to try to make sure those concerns are covered.

2945
03:47:22,842 --> 03:47:23,362
So thank you.

2946
03:47:23,762 --> 03:47:25,163
Thank you, Dr. Scarapelli.

2947
03:47:26,725 --> 03:47:28,747
Okay, we have, let's see.

2948
03:47:30,569 --> 03:47:33,392
Diane Sullivan, name and address for the record, please.

2949
03:47:38,458 --> 03:47:38,838
Hi.

2950
03:47:41,982 --> 03:47:42,883
I'm still muted.

2951
03:47:47,160 --> 03:47:47,660
I'm muted.

2952
03:47:48,040 --> 03:47:49,401
No, we can hear you.

2953
03:47:49,461 --> 03:47:49,681
Okay.

2954
03:47:49,841 --> 03:47:50,121
All right.

2955
03:47:50,161 --> 03:47:50,661
I'm sorry.

2956
03:47:50,801 --> 03:47:51,862
It told me that I was still muted.

2957
03:47:51,902 --> 03:47:52,562
Thank you so much.

2958
03:47:52,682 --> 03:47:54,023
Um, president Falco.

2959
03:47:54,103 --> 03:48:04,087
I'm sorry, Diane Sullivan, Jerome street, uh, West Medford, the bill, um, president Falco, I want to thank you for your leadership, um, through this very tense, um, evening.

2960
03:48:04,107 --> 03:48:12,110
Um, I want to thank all the council members, um, for, uh, for those who are here, um, sticking it out, you know, hearing from the community.

2961
03:48:13,070 --> 03:48:15,751
Um, and I particularly want to thank the community for showing up.

2962
03:48:16,311 --> 03:48:24,333
Um this evening Um and to those particularly who have had the courage to speak before me I've testified before congress.

2963
03:48:24,493 --> 03:48:37,497
Um just before uh, covid and i'm feeling a similar tension, um And anxiousness, uh that I did going, uh, you know to speak before ayana presley and her peers um, and so

2964
03:48:39,078 --> 03:48:51,910
Again, I just want to acknowledge the courage, those who have come to really speak their truth to power, and just acknowledge what it takes to show up in this space.

2965
03:48:51,990 --> 03:48:57,155
Whether it's on Zoom, when we're in proximity of power, it can be a very intimidating experience.

2966
03:48:57,595 --> 03:49:02,000
So I applaud those who have joined us to share here tonight.

2967
03:49:02,940 --> 03:49:12,565
I have been a racial and social justice advocate for a good 20 years now and that was born out of my own family's experience with poverty and homelessness and hunger.

2968
03:49:12,585 --> 03:49:21,049
I have very much, and I had to really think last year in 2019, why I haven't engaged on a local level.

2969
03:49:21,149 --> 03:49:25,851
And that's, I'll tell you why, it's because I share my own experience and I know how people judge.

2970
03:49:26,651 --> 03:49:29,653
So I've taken my story to the state and the national level,

2971
03:49:30,393 --> 03:49:48,009
And I'd like to think, and in fact, I can document the impact that those like myself with the lived experience, again, when we put in proximity to those in power, the very positive impacts that we can have that not only impact our own lives directly, but impact our entire community.

2972
03:49:48,870 --> 03:50:11,417
Um, so I just want to name that um, and I want to actually, uh uplift something that miss eileen Um noted and you know naming these things Um and naming what's happening is not creating the divisiveness What I hope our council hears from us this evening from the community is a call for transparency

2973
03:50:12,220 --> 03:50:21,507
a call to really just keep us engaged, keep us involved, and to do that in a meaningful way, it takes trust.

2974
03:50:22,228 --> 03:50:34,538
And, you know, again, I've been at this for a long time, and I've been, you know, in situations where I have facilitated discussions where, you know, a room full of 400 people and half the room

2975
03:50:34,998 --> 03:50:48,169
are shelter providers, often looked at as extensions of the arms of government, the police at the door trying to keep families out, and 200 families in the room who right in that moment are experiencing homelessness.

2976
03:50:48,750 --> 03:50:57,858
And together, despite the tension, despite the disagreements on how we might approach policy, we've been able to come to solutions and have impact across the state.

2977
03:50:57,958 --> 03:51:02,742
And unfortunately, maybe not so much right here in Medford, I wish that we could take advantage

2978
03:51:03,463 --> 03:51:07,647
more state resources to address our affordable housing crisis.

2979
03:51:07,667 --> 03:51:13,714
And I think that when we get down to it, it feels like for a lot of us, a line has been drawn in the sand.

2980
03:51:13,734 --> 03:51:14,816
So let's just name that.

2981
03:51:15,837 --> 03:51:19,221
I will name how long I've lived in this community, 15 years.

2982
03:51:19,321 --> 03:51:21,704
I agree that it doesn't matter if you move

2983
03:51:22,344 --> 03:51:24,925
If you became my neighbor tomorrow, I will welcome you.

2984
03:51:25,625 --> 03:51:29,786
And I trust that my neighbors here in West Medford do the same because that's just how we do.

2985
03:51:30,666 --> 03:51:36,767
And so, and there's something certainly to be said and to be learned from that.

2986
03:51:36,827 --> 03:51:40,428
But I've been here for 15 years and I'll tell you, I've been engaging a lot more locally.

2987
03:51:40,448 --> 03:51:51,531
And again, this was not, this came pre-COVID when I identified there are issues here in my community that have impacted me that I need to address and speak up on and find that courage to have this conversation with you all.

2988
03:51:52,311 --> 03:51:58,836
And so, as I think about how we move forward, it really takes this transparency.

2989
03:51:58,916 --> 03:52:00,837
You all are going to be held accountable.

2990
03:52:01,637 --> 03:52:05,060
How that makes you feel, I get it.

2991
03:52:05,420 --> 03:52:06,541
We all make mistakes.

2992
03:52:06,661 --> 03:52:18,469
It took, I marked the time, it wasn't until I believe 9.35, two hours and 35 minutes into this meeting before, and I just wanna quote Councilor Knight appropriately,

2993
03:52:19,509 --> 03:52:28,031
Uh, sorry looking through my notes here, but it wasn't until then that I didn't hear an apology Um for what I feel was the divisiveness that was created.

2994
03:52:28,772 --> 03:52:31,752
Um But it took two hours and 35 minutes.

2995
03:52:32,152 --> 03:52:48,237
Um For the community to hear even acknowledgement that the council could have done it better Um, and so i'm here to say, you know as a community member i'm looking at the takeaways, you know for the first time living in this community where I have felt so safe and welcomed I don't

2996
03:52:49,737 --> 03:52:52,578
and Again, having experienced poverty.

2997
03:52:52,598 --> 03:53:12,044
I'll tell you one thing a lot of us, you know, I'm seeing white allies here Which is fantastic, but you know, we have and if we're feeling uncomfortable with all of our privilege in fact, we're feeling anxious We have to acknowledge how particularly our young black leaders who definitely are showing up and

2998
03:53:12,904 --> 03:53:18,467
How do we create the space for the for for them to feel comfortable to come and present their issues?

2999
03:53:18,907 --> 03:53:39,957
In a way that they feel is meaningful and is not just heard but is then digested and acted upon Um, so again i'm trained i'm optimistic and I know campaigns take time and I know that it has taken So long for us to be able to name these issues And to say and to own them and we all need to own it because and you know what i'm going to land on this if

3000
03:53:42,032 --> 03:53:50,717
How we emerge from this pandemic has always been on my mind from when we first hit it, because I think as we all know, it has revealed the inequities that have lived here.

3001
03:53:51,737 --> 03:53:55,359
With a 10% poverty rate, let's name these things.

3002
03:53:56,100 --> 03:54:05,505
And if at the end of the day, because I too trust my instincts, and I've got skin in this game, and I've been doing this for a long time.

3003
03:54:06,866 --> 03:54:10,128
And if we're not listening and engaging the community,

3004
03:54:11,188 --> 03:54:18,474
Um on the level and and i'll tell you and if the community stops showing up, um, then All of this for nothing.

3005
03:54:19,275 --> 03:54:31,545
Um All of this to say we called a few folks out on their wrongdoing i'm telling you We have to be calling ourselves out and looking ourselves in the mirror and saying now this time is different

3006
03:54:31,865 --> 03:54:39,808
We own this and we're all showing up and we're going to continue to show up and support the leaders who emerge From from these times of tension like this.

3007
03:54:39,868 --> 03:54:41,609
So again, i'll rest there.

3008
03:54:42,069 --> 03:54:48,432
Um, but I I encourage us all to take a look in the mirror Um, and i'm so grateful that we're having this conversation.

3009
03:54:48,752 --> 03:54:53,234
And again, i'm thankful to all of you for hanging in there tonight i'm encouraged.

3010
03:54:53,654 --> 03:54:55,695
Um And and I look forward to working.

3011
03:54:56,015 --> 03:54:59,396
Um, even with those with whom i'm just going to disagree politically on a lot of issues.

3012
03:54:59,917 --> 03:55:00,257
Thank you

3013
03:55:00,939 --> 03:55:01,560
Thank you, Diane.

3014
03:55:02,521 --> 03:55:03,984
Mr. Council President?

3015
03:55:04,404 --> 03:55:05,946
Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

3016
03:55:06,267 --> 03:55:08,811
If I can, Diane, thank you very much.

3017
03:55:09,411 --> 03:55:14,599
And again, if that's what it takes to heal, I apologize.

3018
03:55:15,421 --> 03:55:21,424
to all of the community if I offended them in any way by the actions we had.

3019
03:55:22,004 --> 03:55:30,988
So again, but I hope you understand there was no ill intent, there was no ill will, but I understand the reasons why people that did speak tonight have expressed that.

3020
03:55:31,028 --> 03:55:32,989
So thank you for coming forward tonight.

3021
03:55:33,289 --> 03:55:33,990
I appreciate that.

3022
03:55:35,891 --> 03:55:36,211
Thank you.

3023
03:55:37,411 --> 03:55:38,332
Let's see, we have...

3024
03:55:46,492 --> 03:55:50,255
Gia, name and address for the record, please, Gia.

3025
03:55:51,897 --> 03:55:52,757
Can you hear me right now?

3026
03:55:53,818 --> 03:55:54,459
Yes, we can.

3027
03:55:55,039 --> 03:55:55,400
Cool.

3028
03:55:55,940 --> 03:55:59,863
Giovanna Paolini-Ferrini, 76 Ashland Street.

3029
03:56:02,165 --> 03:56:05,428
I just wanted to, I wanted to thank everyone here.

3030
03:56:05,468 --> 03:56:07,409
Let me see if I can turn my video on real quick.

3031
03:56:11,012 --> 03:56:13,214
Zoom to be honest, but okay, cool.

3032
03:56:16,682 --> 03:56:22,104
I wanted to thank all of the council members for being here tonight.

3033
03:56:22,484 --> 03:56:26,025
And more importantly, I wanted to thank all the community for coming out.

3034
03:56:26,045 --> 03:56:28,565
I wanted to thank everyone for staying out this late.

3035
03:56:28,925 --> 03:56:35,027
I think it's really, it's important to be active.

3036
03:56:35,627 --> 03:56:39,368
I've been wanting to come to council meetings for a while now.

3037
03:56:40,169 --> 03:56:44,050
And with recent things going on, I think it kind of hit a tipping point.

3038
03:56:45,497 --> 03:57:08,549
I just wanted to kind of echo what I heard earlier about hearing a lot of dismissiveness from a lot of the council and some of people's experiences, because I think things like that make it difficult for people who are new, who want to get involved, to really participate.

3039
03:57:08,589 --> 03:57:10,310
I think things like that make it intimidating.

3040
03:57:10,941 --> 03:57:13,763
You know, I feel like there were constant interruptions.

3041
03:57:14,644 --> 03:57:16,785
You know, they're even mocking at a few points.

3042
03:57:19,407 --> 03:57:29,114
But, you know, like, I think it's valid for people to, you know, talk about their experiences and, you know, point out that Medford, you know, isn't united.

3043
03:57:29,134 --> 03:57:32,937
There were a lot of people who were saying, you know, you're pulling us apart right now.

3044
03:57:33,437 --> 03:57:34,338
But, you know,

3045
03:57:35,130 --> 03:57:36,530
Hasn't really always been that way.

3046
03:57:36,550 --> 03:58:03,697
I've been harassed on the street plenty of times before I've been physically threatened and and you know I'm not even one of the most at-risk types of communities Right now Yeah, I think that was most of what I wanted to point out I hope to in the future see a more I Hope to hear I hope to see more open ears in the future

3047
03:58:05,765 --> 03:58:06,446
Thank you very much.

3048
03:58:06,466 --> 03:58:07,947
Thank you.

3049
03:58:08,407 --> 03:58:08,847
Thank you.

3050
03:58:12,350 --> 03:58:21,557
Up next is Gene Nozzo.

3051
03:58:22,077 --> 03:58:22,357
Gene.

3052
03:58:28,182 --> 03:58:30,043
Gene Nozzo, name and address for the record, please.

3053
03:58:39,477 --> 03:58:42,240
Okay, uh, maybe gene stepped away for a minute.

3054
03:58:42,260 --> 03:58:44,842
So we'll uh, we'll find someone else.

3055
03:58:45,243 --> 03:58:57,995
Um Jake lee name and address for the record, please Hi jake lee 83 damon road Can you hear me?

3056
03:58:58,596 --> 03:59:00,998
Yes, we can sorry, um

3057
03:59:02,772 --> 03:59:06,694
My, uh, comment is for, uh, the school committee, uh, member of Jake.

3058
03:59:06,755 --> 03:59:08,496
I, uh, oh, I'm sorry.

3059
03:59:08,556 --> 03:59:09,997
His name is Paul Roscoe.

3060
03:59:10,077 --> 03:59:10,857
I believe his name was.

3061
03:59:11,918 --> 03:59:29,529
Uh, so, but, um, when we're talking about the school committee tonight or no, I know, but he had, he had a few, he had a few good points, but my point with that is, um, should, should he, uh, he needs to be a little professional.

3062
03:59:29,589 --> 03:59:31,230
I mean, he needs to make his bed, I think.

3063
03:59:31,749 --> 03:59:32,529
His bed's unmade.

3064
03:59:32,549 --> 03:59:33,850
Okay.

3065
03:59:34,690 --> 03:59:35,390
Excuse me, sir.

3066
03:59:35,630 --> 03:59:36,751
Please keep it professional.

3067
03:59:38,271 --> 03:59:38,651
I am.

3068
03:59:38,671 --> 03:59:42,352
I'm just, I'm trying to look at the thing here and his bed is unmade.

3069
03:59:47,714 --> 03:59:48,734
Is there anything you want to add, sir?

3070
03:59:56,877 --> 03:59:57,157
Next.

3071
04:00:01,908 --> 04:00:05,670
Let's see here, we got Ginozo.

3072
04:00:07,651 --> 04:00:08,171
Ginozo?

3073
04:00:13,534 --> 04:00:15,055
Mr. President, is she unmuted?

3074
04:00:16,016 --> 04:00:21,378
Yeah, she's unmuted, so I'll come back to her.

3075
04:00:21,518 --> 04:00:24,700
I know there was one other person, I think it's Buck.

3076
04:00:25,060 --> 04:00:25,501
Here we go.

3077
04:00:28,342 --> 04:00:29,743
Buck, name and address for the record, please.

3078
04:00:31,704 --> 04:00:33,426
Yes, 101 Fells Ave.

3079
04:00:33,466 --> 04:00:34,327
My name is Brian Buck.

3080
04:00:34,387 --> 04:00:36,069
I use he, him, his pronouns.

3081
04:00:37,130 --> 04:00:38,151
I just wanted to reach out.

3082
04:00:38,211 --> 04:00:40,253
I think I won the award of being the last one.

3083
04:00:41,154 --> 04:00:46,159
So just wanted to say that to Mr. Scarapelli, I really apologize that there were threats like that sent to you.

3084
04:00:46,759 --> 04:00:48,001
It's completely inappropriate.

3085
04:00:49,562 --> 04:00:55,548
also wanted to just say that in taking in the meeting tonight, this is my first meeting that I've sat all the way through.

3086
04:00:55,568 --> 04:01:03,515
I think there's been a lot in terms of tone that I'm not sure the counselors are realizing is impact.

3087
04:01:04,120 --> 04:01:05,981
community is impacting the divide.

3088
04:01:06,561 --> 04:01:12,685
And it's really hard not to, but I would ask for slightly more professionalism and for people to reflect on that.

3089
04:01:13,626 --> 04:01:15,947
I also had just one of two questions.

3090
04:01:16,007 --> 04:01:18,348
If counselors could address it very quickly, that'd be great for me.

3091
04:01:18,789 --> 04:01:22,611
One would be our budget is an area where we see a lot of

3092
04:01:25,298 --> 04:01:27,480
Let's say unconscious bias come out, right?

3093
04:01:27,540 --> 04:01:30,282
Like a lot of decisions are going to be made about where to spend money.

3094
04:01:30,862 --> 04:01:36,206
And a lot of unconscious bias comes out in that way, where things we might not even be aware of impacting us.

3095
04:01:36,626 --> 04:01:43,932
So I'm curious, what, if any, work any of the councillors have done in terms of anti-racism work or recognizing unconscious bias over the last month?

3096
04:01:45,152 --> 04:01:48,735
And I'm also curious if any of them want to just say something nice about someone.

3097
04:01:49,055 --> 04:01:51,237
It feels like three against four for whatever reason.

3098
04:01:52,278 --> 04:01:55,620
I just want to know if any of them wanted to say something nice about someone on the other side.

3099
04:01:59,583 --> 04:02:00,043
I don't mind.

3100
04:02:00,063 --> 04:02:01,384
I don't mind Council Falco.

3101
04:02:04,446 --> 04:02:09,170
If I may, first of all, thank you for staying in the meeting as long as you have.

3102
04:02:09,190 --> 04:02:11,151
I want to thank everyone that stayed the whole time.

3103
04:02:12,648 --> 04:02:32,612
know I'll be honest I've worked with a number everyone in the city council for a number of years and uh Zach and Nicole um you know I've worked with them the past few months but you know I really feel like and I mean this when I say this this has been a trying time and a trying week but you know I feel you know pretty much

3104
04:02:33,105 --> 04:02:34,026
do all get along.

3105
04:02:34,086 --> 04:02:49,199
I mean, we differ on issues and, uh, you know, and that, that's, you know, I mean, we agreed to, I always like to say, you know, at some point, sometimes we agree to disagree, but I think we're all, um, you know, working towards, you know, trying to move method forward in the right direction.

3106
04:02:49,419 --> 04:02:50,961
Hey, we all have different ways of doing that.

3107
04:02:50,981 --> 04:02:52,922
We all have different opinions, but I got you.

3108
04:02:53,743 --> 04:02:54,584
All right.

3109
04:02:54,784 --> 04:02:55,164
Thank you.

3110
04:02:58,567 --> 04:02:59,388
But, um,

3111
04:03:00,085 --> 04:03:03,087
But I genuinely do enjoy working with everyone on the city council.

3112
04:03:03,668 --> 04:03:06,690
You know, if I may, that's, I just wanted to add that in.

3113
04:03:06,830 --> 04:03:08,552
So, council.

3114
04:03:08,592 --> 04:03:09,292
Mr. President?

3115
04:03:09,753 --> 04:03:09,973
Yes.

3116
04:03:11,354 --> 04:03:14,516
Mr. President, I can't see anybody because I'm on the phone.

3117
04:03:14,536 --> 04:03:17,318
So if you could call me at your convenience.

3118
04:03:18,159 --> 04:03:19,040
Vice President Caviello.

3119
04:03:21,202 --> 04:03:21,962
Thank you, Mr. President.

3120
04:03:22,063 --> 04:03:26,205
And again, you know, I enjoy working with all my colleagues.

3121
04:03:26,285 --> 04:03:29,026
I hold no ill will to anyone on the council.

3122
04:03:29,066 --> 04:03:31,928
Again, listen, we could all agree to disagree on things.

3123
04:03:32,268 --> 04:03:37,131
But again, we don't have to have any animosity toward each other.

3124
04:03:37,952 --> 04:03:42,435
At the end of the day, it's a council meeting, and when it's over, we're back to being friends again.

3125
04:03:42,855 --> 04:03:49,119
And this situation has put a strain on some friendships that we have amongst the council.

3126
04:03:49,520 --> 04:03:56,224
And I actually, I feel bad about that, and I hope this is resolved so we can go back to where we were before.

3127
04:03:58,860 --> 04:03:59,961
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

3128
04:04:00,001 --> 04:04:01,781
We have Councilor Knight and Councilor Morrell.

3129
04:04:01,821 --> 04:04:02,342
Councilor Knight.

3130
04:04:03,342 --> 04:04:06,183
Mr. President, I'll be the first to say, business is business.

3131
04:04:06,203 --> 04:04:07,824
There's nothing personal about this at all.

3132
04:04:08,545 --> 04:04:09,265
This is business.

3133
04:04:10,886 --> 04:04:13,087
It's about advocating for what we think is right.

3134
04:04:13,807 --> 04:04:17,849
And I would never, ever, ever pass judgment upon any one of my councilors for doing the same.

3135
04:04:18,883 --> 04:04:22,905
I think it's important to point out, as Councilor Falco said, John, how long do we go back?

3136
04:04:22,945 --> 04:04:24,526
You were my basketball coach at St.

3137
04:04:24,566 --> 04:04:27,188
Francis when I played CYO when I was in the 10th grade.

3138
04:04:27,628 --> 04:04:28,869
I've known you a long time.

3139
04:04:30,329 --> 04:04:34,872
We've had plenty of disagreements from that day forward, and we've always been able to get past it.

3140
04:04:34,952 --> 04:04:36,112
It has never been personal.

3141
04:04:37,173 --> 04:04:40,415
I think that that's what's getting lost in translation here as well, Mr. President.

3142
04:04:41,132 --> 04:04:44,613
There's a narrative that's going on, but there's also a reality that's going on.

3143
04:04:44,633 --> 04:04:49,194
The reality is that there's not really much infighting going on between this group.

3144
04:04:49,234 --> 04:04:51,475
There was a disagreement about a process and a procedure.

3145
04:04:51,795 --> 04:04:52,275
That was it.

3146
04:04:52,675 --> 04:04:56,456
That doesn't mean that tomorrow we're not going to go back to work and do the things that we're supposed to do.

3147
04:04:57,316 --> 04:04:59,337
People tend to disagree all the time.

3148
04:04:59,357 --> 04:04:59,817
That's okay.

3149
04:04:59,837 --> 04:05:00,277
It's healthy.

3150
04:05:01,017 --> 04:05:07,159
I mean, I never met two people that ever agreed on everything all the time, and I certainly never met anybody that's right all the time, and that goes for me, too.

3151
04:05:08,150 --> 04:05:15,276
But, what I am saying, Mr. President, and I think it's important to point out, is there was nothing ever anything personal about this discussion and this situation.

3152
04:05:15,317 --> 04:05:21,242
It was a matter of a principle and a procedural defect that people felt existed.

3153
04:05:21,642 --> 04:05:25,765
And, we did what we thought was right, and we've come up with a solution to that.

3154
04:05:26,426 --> 04:05:32,271
You know, I think that, you know, for the last four hours and nine minutes, we've sat here and we've listened.

3155
04:05:33,871 --> 04:05:34,811
to the community.

3156
04:05:35,431 --> 04:05:42,395
Some of the stuff had more to do with other issues and a little bit less to do about our budget schedule and when we're going to schedule it and how we're going to schedule it.

3157
04:05:42,415 --> 04:05:43,036
And that's okay.

3158
04:05:43,836 --> 04:05:53,041
But I think that it's time that we move on past the issue, Mr. President, because I think that all the members of the council are all in agreement that we have a, you know, plan of action to take.

3159
04:05:53,381 --> 04:05:57,744
And once that process is exhausted, then, you know, we'll be right back to work again.

3160
04:05:58,244 --> 04:06:01,086
And it's not going to be any beef or any sweat if anybody's back.

3161
04:06:02,668 --> 04:06:06,451
We're here today at the regular council meeting to take care of the business, and we'll continue to do that.

3162
04:06:06,511 --> 04:06:09,073
This isn't a personal dispute between anybody on the council.

3163
04:06:09,454 --> 04:06:11,555
It was something that was a disagreement about policy.

3164
04:06:12,576 --> 04:06:14,138
That's going to happen from time to time.

3165
04:06:15,479 --> 04:06:19,803
The narrative that we're all fighting and we can't get along and this and that isn't the truth.

3166
04:06:19,943 --> 04:06:23,446
That isn't factual.

3167
04:06:23,506 --> 04:06:24,787
I think that, at the end of the day,

3168
04:06:25,525 --> 04:06:32,271
When this budget season closes and when this legislative session closes, this council is going to put out a lot of good work product.

3169
04:06:32,511 --> 04:06:37,495
And constituents here in the community and the residents in this community are going to have something to be proud of.

3170
04:06:38,216 --> 04:06:40,378
And I'm proud to serve with each and every one of you.

3171
04:06:40,878 --> 04:06:49,085
And I owe no hostilities or animosity towards any of you for making the decisions that you make for what you feel are in the best interest of the community.

3172
04:06:49,846 --> 04:06:51,187
So with that being said, I thank

3173
04:06:52,665 --> 04:06:53,426
It says be buck.

3174
04:06:53,486 --> 04:06:55,167
I missed your first name when I was writing it down.

3175
04:06:55,207 --> 04:06:56,347
I apologize.

3176
04:06:56,627 --> 04:06:58,949
Sorry, it's Brian, Brian, Brian.

3177
04:06:58,989 --> 04:07:11,917
I thank Brian for giving the opportunity to kind of let this thing speak on this issue so that we can get down to the regular order of business.

3178
04:07:11,937 --> 04:07:12,457
Here we are at 1111.

3179
04:07:12,717 --> 04:07:17,340
I'm sitting outside my kid's bedroom right now on zoom and they're yelling at me every 30 seconds.

3180
04:07:19,065 --> 04:07:25,146
So, with that being said, you know, we have a plan of action, we've explained ourselves, and I think it's time for us to move on.

3181
04:07:26,407 --> 04:07:27,687
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3182
04:07:28,527 --> 04:07:30,867
We have a couple, I think two more people that want to speak.

3183
04:07:30,907 --> 04:07:32,908
We also have Councilor Morrell that would like to speak.

3184
04:07:32,948 --> 04:07:33,628
Councilor Morrell.

3185
04:07:34,028 --> 04:07:34,668
Thank you, Mr. President.

3186
04:07:34,708 --> 04:07:36,549
I just wanted to address the first question.

3187
04:07:36,589 --> 04:07:42,510
I mean, it's endless work as far as, and ongoing work as far as bias and anti-racism.

3188
04:07:42,850 --> 04:07:43,890
So, I mean, I've got

3189
04:07:44,347 --> 04:07:45,248
books on the bookshelf.

3190
04:07:45,308 --> 04:07:47,109
You know, I've got the, the new Jim Crow.

3191
04:07:47,209 --> 04:07:48,629
I've got how to be an anti-racist.

3192
04:07:48,669 --> 04:07:54,573
And there was a great event from the Boston Globe with the author of how to be an anti-racist last week.

3193
04:07:54,613 --> 04:07:55,073
That was great.

3194
04:07:55,093 --> 04:07:56,734
So those are just some highlights.

3195
04:07:57,094 --> 04:07:58,975
And number two, I'll be specific.

3196
04:07:59,595 --> 04:08:07,720
When I ran my first sign meeting as chair of the science subcommittee, counselor Scarpelli was very giving of his knowledge and his time to help me run that meeting.

3197
04:08:08,140 --> 04:08:09,381
And I'm very appreciative of that.

3198
04:08:09,401 --> 04:08:10,741
And I continue to be appreciative of that.

3199
04:08:10,862 --> 04:08:11,582
So thank you.

3200
04:08:14,550 --> 04:08:15,771
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

3201
04:08:16,431 --> 04:08:17,611
Councilor Falco, if I can.

3202
04:08:17,631 --> 04:08:18,712
Yes, Councilor Scarbelli.

3203
04:08:19,853 --> 04:08:26,215
I too, I think that we talk about the new councilors and the older councilors.

3204
04:08:26,256 --> 04:08:27,896
The truth of the matter is we're all councilors.

3205
04:08:28,477 --> 04:08:33,079
And I welcome, I've worked with John.

3206
04:08:33,159 --> 04:08:39,222
I think me and you have been gone through some really tough times, both in the school department and now in the council.

3207
04:08:39,302 --> 04:08:39,882
And I think that

3208
04:08:40,369 --> 04:08:51,471
You know, sometimes when a significant other butt heads, I think that, you know, you get angry with each other and I think that we need to mend some fences, I think.

3209
04:08:51,591 --> 04:09:02,114
But I think that Councilor Morrell and Councilor Beaz, you bring a vision that I think that we should be open to listen and I appreciate that.

3210
04:09:03,414 --> 04:09:08,895
But, you know, for my fellow councilors that took a stand, the truth was, I think Dean,

3211
04:09:09,495 --> 04:09:17,264
Dean said it right early Dean talking early when you know, sometimes it's tough to make a decision That's not going to be popular, but that's what we do for our job.

3212
04:09:17,324 --> 04:09:28,637
So Brian just so to the inequities and I've had the fort I'm fortunate to work in a community where I teach kids of color I teach

3213
04:09:29,798 --> 04:09:34,320
And I work with our multicultural community in Somerville.

3214
04:09:34,961 --> 04:09:42,244
And we've faced as a soccer coach and head of recreation, we faced a lot of adversity and racism.

3215
04:09:42,364 --> 04:09:46,726
And to be honest with you, I have a different insight than most.

3216
04:09:46,786 --> 04:09:49,228
I would, you know, if I had time to read books and

3217
04:09:50,295 --> 04:09:59,788
and it would help me, but the truth is, I sit down with a lot of kids and parents of color or Latino descent.

3218
04:10:00,846 --> 04:10:02,507
we talk about different avenues.

3219
04:10:02,607 --> 04:10:06,490
And I know that that's one of the reasons why I'm pushing for a forum.

3220
04:10:07,231 --> 04:10:14,817
And I know that Councilor Rao made a comment that it's, you know, at the time that, you know, we don't need our people of color to be teaching us.

3221
04:10:14,897 --> 04:10:21,262
But I, to be honest with you, I use that as a learning tool to help me understand

3222
04:10:21,782 --> 04:10:27,329
these difficult times we're going through, and how I can relate as a privileged white man, and how I can help them.

3223
04:10:27,770 --> 04:10:36,641
So it's been a very eye-opening last few weeks, and like Councilman Knight said, this is our job.

3224
04:10:36,801 --> 04:10:38,143
We signed on to it.

3225
04:10:39,203 --> 04:10:49,207
people might not agree with what I do, what I say, but it's what people entrusted me, that voted me in to do so.

3226
04:10:49,227 --> 04:10:51,948
Thank you very much for bringing that full circle again, so thank you.

3227
04:10:52,869 --> 04:10:54,129
Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelley.

3228
04:10:54,149 --> 04:10:54,769
Councilor Pierce.

3229
04:10:56,410 --> 04:10:57,290
Thank you, Mr. President.

3230
04:10:57,450 --> 04:11:03,833
I'm gonna try to answer both questions and be relatively quick because I know how late it is, but they also deserve serious thought.

3231
04:11:05,615 --> 04:11:14,039
In terms of unconscious bias, I don't know if I've talked about it here before, but, um, the year before my senior year of college, my best friend was killed, hit and killed by a car.

3232
04:11:14,359 --> 04:11:24,445
And, um, you know, I learned a lot that year about what it means to be a product of the circumstances and the systems around you.

3233
04:11:24,465 --> 04:11:34,690
Um, and to see how I was given a lot of chances that a lot of our friends weren't given to make up the assignment or.

3234
04:11:35,322 --> 04:11:46,145
make up the test or, um, you know, just live my life and, and be sad and not show up to class for months and still get a good grade because I did the work at the end of the day.

3235
04:11:46,165 --> 04:11:57,988
Um, and I have friends who were impacted deeply by that, that, that, um, who didn't have the privileges that I had, um, who, who weren't afforded that opportunity.

3236
04:11:58,048 --> 04:12:03,550
And between that and reading and learning and speaking to friends and speaking to people, um,

3237
04:12:05,193 --> 04:12:17,757
One of the most I wrote for my college paper and and my senior column was almost entirely about this and and it was a huge learning experience for me and um and You know, i'll end it there.

3238
04:12:17,817 --> 04:12:30,700
But but that's that's really when I started to really grapple with this in a deep way um and then separately You know in terms of the council Look at our voting record.

3239
04:12:31,041 --> 04:12:32,081
So much of our votes are 7-0

3240
04:12:33,082 --> 04:12:35,383
I sit between Councillor Scarpelli and Councillor Knight.

3241
04:12:35,943 --> 04:12:42,944
I often lean over and ask them a question, you know, especially the first meeting when I had, you know, quite frankly, not quite the idea of what I was doing.

3242
04:12:43,024 --> 04:12:48,265
And they've been incredibly helpful in providing information and institutional knowledge of the council.

3243
04:12:48,785 --> 04:12:55,367
Councillor Marks and Councillor Carviello, we had a great subcommittee meeting together on housing and housing stability during this crisis.

3244
04:12:56,930 --> 04:12:58,871
So we do a lot together and we get a lot done.

3245
04:12:59,892 --> 04:13:05,635
That doesn't mean we don't disagree often and that those disagreements aren't serious.

3246
04:13:06,315 --> 04:13:11,738
But we work together, we work through it, we're here for the city of Medford.

3247
04:13:11,798 --> 04:13:13,479
So that's why I show up.

3248
04:13:14,179 --> 04:13:14,980
Thank you, Mr. President.

3249
04:13:18,030 --> 04:13:19,230
Council Marks.

3250
04:13:19,310 --> 04:13:27,053
Mr. President, I know there's a few people waiting because I received a text, but I'll be brief also in the interest of everyone's time.

3251
04:13:28,253 --> 04:13:32,494
Regarding the council, I feel like I have a good working relationship with all the council.

3252
04:13:32,934 --> 04:13:34,435
Do we need to approve upon things?

3253
04:13:34,935 --> 04:13:36,175
Absolutely, Mr. President.

3254
04:13:36,875 --> 04:13:38,916
I agree with what was mentioned by my colleagues.

3255
04:13:39,396 --> 04:13:46,258
I think in the first six months of this year, this has been one of the most productive councils I've ever worked with.

3256
04:13:46,738 --> 04:13:49,999
The pieces of legislation that we've put forward are amazing.

3257
04:13:50,379 --> 04:13:54,581
The marijuana ordinance and the list goes on and on, Mr. President.

3258
04:13:55,661 --> 04:14:01,383
You know, over the last couple of days, when I had people call me up and said, geez, Mike, what the heck's happening?

3259
04:14:01,403 --> 04:14:02,803
And I say, oh, about the budget?

3260
04:14:03,103 --> 04:14:08,125
They said, no, you and Adam Knight are voting on the same issue and you're in the same stance together.

3261
04:14:08,725 --> 04:14:20,439
So, you know, these are things, Mr. President, that we as a council, you know, we work through, we'll get through it, Mr. President, and I look forward to a productive remaining of the year.

3262
04:14:21,100 --> 04:14:26,586
And I think it's important regarding our own

3263
04:14:27,507 --> 04:14:31,190
diversity, and so forth, that you always keep an open mind, Mr. President.

3264
04:14:31,310 --> 04:14:33,432
I approach everything with an open mind.

3265
04:14:33,792 --> 04:14:37,635
And I always say, as my mother taught me, treat people as you would like to be treated.

3266
04:14:38,076 --> 04:14:39,377
And that's what I walk through in life.

3267
04:14:39,477 --> 04:14:40,498
And I try to do the best.

3268
04:14:40,998 --> 04:14:45,221
I think we all have inherent prejudice that are built into us.

3269
04:14:45,842 --> 04:14:48,284
And I try to check myself every day regarding that.

3270
04:14:48,924 --> 04:14:49,845
Am I perfect?

3271
04:14:49,905 --> 04:14:53,028
No, but it's a work in progress, Mr. President.

3272
04:14:53,468 --> 04:14:53,828
Thank you.

3273
04:14:54,289 --> 04:14:55,370
Thank you, Councilman Marks.

3274
04:14:56,490 --> 04:14:57,071
Thank you, Brian.

3275
04:14:57,762 --> 04:14:58,703
Thank you so much, everyone.

3276
04:14:59,083 --> 04:14:59,483
Thank you.

3277
04:15:00,023 --> 04:15:00,343
So let's see.

3278
04:15:00,384 --> 04:15:01,384
We have Jean Nuzzo.

3279
04:15:01,404 --> 04:15:02,445
We're going to try her again.

3280
04:15:02,465 --> 04:15:04,186
We tried to get her a couple of times.

3281
04:15:04,206 --> 04:15:05,587
Not sure if she stepped away.

3282
04:15:05,627 --> 04:15:05,927
Let's see.

3283
04:15:05,947 --> 04:15:06,787
Let me just find her.

3284
04:15:08,068 --> 04:15:08,348
Jean.

3285
04:15:10,069 --> 04:15:10,830
Can you hear me?

3286
04:15:11,390 --> 04:15:12,551
Yes.

3287
04:15:13,871 --> 04:15:14,151
Sure.

3288
04:15:14,352 --> 04:15:16,673
It's Jean Nuzzo, Parrish Street in Medford.

3289
04:15:18,494 --> 04:15:18,834
Thank you.

3290
04:15:19,054 --> 04:15:21,035
I apologize for not having video.

3291
04:15:21,616 --> 04:15:24,077
As you can see, there's some technical difficulties.

3292
04:15:24,097 --> 04:15:26,579
So I'm hoping not having video will help.

3293
04:15:27,559 --> 04:15:35,246
This is my fifth cycle of budget, and I'm very excited to see that there's a lot of interest in it.

3294
04:15:36,267 --> 04:15:41,992
I just, I'm going to try to adhere to the rabbits rules, and just have a few points to make about coven.

3295
04:15:43,113 --> 04:15:47,015
meeting logistics, and I hope you'll give me a little bit of latitude.

3296
04:15:48,255 --> 04:15:55,158
So, I agree that preventing the spread of COVID is crucial in these unprecedented times.

3297
04:15:55,318 --> 04:16:00,380
However, it was just announced yesterday across the wire

3298
04:16:00,940 --> 04:16:03,781
that Massachusetts transmission rate is 0.67.

3299
04:16:04,181 --> 04:16:13,404
This is 0.33 below the 1.0 rate that is considered significant spread of COVID.

3300
04:16:14,124 --> 04:16:15,364
So what does that tell us?

3301
04:16:15,465 --> 04:16:25,988
That tells us that we're doing a really good job of social distancing, wearing our masks, and doing the things that we can to prevent spread.

3302
04:16:26,928 --> 04:16:32,792
We've just entered in Massachusetts into the phase two, two on Monday.

3303
04:16:33,592 --> 04:16:38,375
And what that means is that we can have an internal occupancy of 50%.

3304
04:16:38,535 --> 04:16:46,620
In the city of Medford, we have three large scale spaces that are available for these types of meeting.

3305
04:16:47,261 --> 04:16:53,705
One is the Alden Chambers, which the city council meets in on Tuesday prior to the COVID crisis.

3306
04:16:55,005 --> 04:17:01,187
One is the Karen Theater at the high school, and one is the Chevalier.

3307
04:17:01,287 --> 04:17:08,429
At 50% occupancy, I've seen the Alden Chamber full to approximately 200 to 250 people.

3308
04:17:08,909 --> 04:17:22,734
So at 50% occupancy, we would be able to house roughly 100 people and maintain the social distancing requirements that are required, bless you, for the COVID-19 pandemic.

3309
04:17:25,135 --> 04:17:27,636
for the COVID guidelines for the state of Massachusetts.

3310
04:17:28,356 --> 04:17:42,583
Additionally, in conjunction with the double masking and six foot distance, when you can't keep a six foot distance, it's common practice currently in the industry to install additional clear barriers

3311
04:17:43,183 --> 04:17:49,405
six feet high and approximately four feet wide that further address the distancing requirement.

3312
04:17:49,925 --> 04:17:52,566
So there are things that are being done in the industry.

3313
04:17:52,886 --> 04:18:02,370
We've retrofitted hundreds of thousands of square feet of office and lab space to allow for people to be able to work effectively.

3314
04:18:02,790 --> 04:18:04,910
And I hope that you'll consider these things.

3315
04:18:05,251 --> 04:18:11,813
I just want to also touch upon two more things with respect to COVID, because I think it's important that we keep hope.

3316
04:18:12,473 --> 04:18:29,792
The first is just yesterday it was announced that pharmaceutical companies believe that they are closing in on the potential vaccine and a few, who I won't mention here, have said that they even think they might have something by early to mid-fall.

3317
04:18:30,372 --> 04:18:57,737
And then the second noteworthy item is that ramivudine, which is being tested as an injectable, has done so well that the manufacturing and pharmaceutical company has announced, I believe it was this morning, that they are investigating an inhalation dose, which means that people will be able to dose themselves under doctor's orders as they would a regular prescription like any other inhaler.

3318
04:18:58,077 --> 04:19:07,874
So these are wonderful things that we can think of the fact that we're at 0.67 percent, people are doing what needs to be done, and there is a way that we can meet together.

3319
04:19:08,873 --> 04:19:14,899
I think it's important because people process information differently.

3320
04:19:15,880 --> 04:19:23,828
People are differently abled, and we need to use every mechanism to provide opportunities for people to be able to participate.

3321
04:19:24,388 --> 04:19:28,112
I know that we did the housing production webinar earlier in the month.

3322
04:19:28,612 --> 04:19:38,101
We were able to turn on, through Zoom, a real-time closed caption, which some folks that were in attendance found really helpful.

3323
04:19:38,542 --> 04:19:46,470
Perhaps we could reach out and share that information so that closed caption would become available to folks attending city council meetings.

3324
04:19:47,730 --> 04:19:54,552
Saying attendance is increased just because of Zoom is really not an apples to apples comparison.

3325
04:19:54,752 --> 04:20:06,435
It's great that we have more people attending, but if it's different people and we've excluded people who were previously there, we've done a disservice to those folks while providing an additional service to others.

3326
04:20:07,035 --> 04:20:15,302
And then even beyond that we have people in our community Who are still on the outskirts for whatever reason and not feeling welcomed into the meanings.

3327
04:20:15,883 --> 04:20:30,916
So I hope that we'll take these opportunities To consider how we can invite all members of our community into these dialogues in person in video and on the phone as well as watching our

3328
04:20:31,416 --> 04:20:39,344
pegged channel that has been a lifeline for many people for many years and part of their social interactions on a regular basis.

3329
04:20:39,725 --> 04:20:45,691
So I do hope we leverage these opportunities to make these things available.

3330
04:20:46,111 --> 04:20:52,878
I would also suggest that it may be worthwhile to investigate having some Zoom

3331
04:20:54,461 --> 04:21:03,273
have some information on Robert's rules of order to help some of the folks who are beginning to attend city Council meetings.

3332
04:21:03,794 --> 04:21:06,638
I can remember when I first started to attend Council meetings.

3333
04:21:07,239 --> 04:21:08,460
It was very daunting.

3334
04:21:08,481 --> 04:21:09,883
It was a little scary.

3335
04:21:10,323 --> 04:21:12,283
And it took me some time to get used to it.

3336
04:21:12,423 --> 04:21:15,024
And even still now, I don't always get it quite right.

3337
04:21:15,424 --> 04:21:32,988
But perhaps where we've got so much interest, making some of these rules and regulations available to people so that they can understand point of information and privilege and all of those things that are called in meanings will help them to understand that this is really just the protocol and processes that are used to counter means.

3338
04:21:33,808 --> 04:21:40,195
The last thing I wondered, and you may not have the answer for me, and it may not be within the realm of questioning.

3339
04:21:41,136 --> 04:21:46,542
I've been thinking about the commentary that folks made earlier about three days out of work.

3340
04:21:46,942 --> 04:21:49,965
If folks were out of work for three days, they would have lost their job.

3341
04:21:50,005 --> 04:21:53,709
And that's true for a lot of people, unless you're providing notice.

3342
04:21:53,909 --> 04:21:55,010
So what I was wondering,

3343
04:21:55,831 --> 04:22:07,960
I would hate to have an opinion that you guys just randomly decided not to show.

3344
04:22:08,080 --> 04:22:14,344
I know we do not always agree but I know you always try to do the very best and I hope that question is not out of line.

3345
04:22:29,530 --> 04:22:34,131
meeting was posted on Wednesday.

3346
04:22:34,151 --> 04:22:36,692
Tuesday meeting was reposted on Thursday.

3347
04:22:54,228 --> 04:23:01,611
They supply emails for the emails and text messages for the meetings on Monday and Tuesday, if I'm correct, Clerk Garnabese?

3348
04:23:04,212 --> 04:23:04,512
Correct.

3349
04:23:05,193 --> 04:23:05,533
All right.

3350
04:23:06,013 --> 04:23:10,415
I just wanted to be sure they weren't no call, no show, because I think that's a narrative that's there.

3351
04:23:10,455 --> 04:23:14,676
And I don't necessarily think that's fair, because as I said, I don't always agree.

3352
04:23:14,997 --> 04:23:20,039
But I know that the councillors tend to try to do their very best to represent folks.

3353
04:23:20,799 --> 04:23:20,899
OK.

3354
04:23:21,319 --> 04:23:22,319
Point of information?

3355
04:23:24,580 --> 04:23:25,160
Thank you.

3356
04:23:25,180 --> 04:23:26,561
Council member Morrell.

3357
04:23:56,454 --> 04:23:58,775
I did not know show a meeting, Mr. President.

3358
04:23:59,395 --> 04:24:09,980
We've had many discussions over this and we've also had a source of disagreement as to whether or not this notification was communicated to you appropriately and clearly.

3359
04:24:10,240 --> 04:24:14,082
And that's part of this situation that we're in today.

3360
04:24:14,222 --> 04:24:18,264
So I think that ultimately, we're at a point now where we're all ready to move on.

3361
04:24:18,304 --> 04:24:19,744
We have a game plan, Mr. President.

3362
04:24:19,784 --> 04:24:20,905
So let's do that.

3363
04:24:22,786 --> 04:24:31,089
I'd ask now if there's nobody else that's willing to talk, but we can close this portion of the meeting and I'll make a motion to table everything that I put on the agenda for later on.

3364
04:24:33,170 --> 04:24:37,852
If I may, Councilor, one person, Joyce has been waiting patiently.

3365
04:24:40,553 --> 04:24:47,636
So, Joyce, name and address for the record, please.

3366
04:24:48,336 --> 04:24:51,258
Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street in Medford.

3367
04:24:51,518 --> 04:24:52,939
Thank you, Joyce.

3368
04:24:53,079 --> 04:24:56,000
I've tried to get in, so it's a long way.

3369
04:24:56,200 --> 04:25:00,523
Anyway, what happened to Mr. Floyd was wrong, illegal, and criminal.

3370
04:25:00,883 --> 04:25:06,406
It is against the law, and the police officer was arrested and will be tried in a court of law, which should happen.

3371
04:25:07,166 --> 04:25:11,329
This is the country where we see problems and make laws to correct problems.

3372
04:25:11,749 --> 04:25:14,150
I do not believe this is a racist country.

3373
04:25:14,670 --> 04:25:17,572
In fact, the statistics do not support that.

3374
04:25:18,073 --> 04:25:26,835
With all the people in this country and the number of times the police are involved, it is not a true statement that supports a country of racism.

3375
04:25:27,435 --> 04:25:36,197
Many of the conversations on TV in the last week have talked about changes that have been made and how we as a country have made things better with the police.

3376
04:25:36,858 --> 04:25:44,239
There are less murders and a better relationship with police and people in many states across this country, including Mass.

3377
04:25:44,880 --> 04:25:46,860
We have elected a black president twice,

3378
04:25:47,630 --> 04:25:55,155
I realize there are some examples of racism, but the facts are more Black people kill Black people than are killed by the police.

3379
04:25:55,755 --> 04:25:58,397
Most cities like Boston are minority.

3380
04:25:59,177 --> 04:26:07,723
The job of a police officer can be extremely dangerous, and more police kill themselves than are killed in the line of duty.

3381
04:26:08,503 --> 04:26:15,267
Police departments throughout this country continue to address racism and focus on relationships with the community.

3382
04:26:17,561 --> 04:26:19,283
I apologize for interrupting.

3383
04:26:20,323 --> 04:26:22,705
Did you want to save this for the police meeting?

3384
04:26:22,725 --> 04:26:24,707
You seem to be talking about law enforcement, that's why.

3385
04:26:24,727 --> 04:26:27,709
Because I go on to something I'm going to ask.

3386
04:26:28,209 --> 04:26:36,376
I was personally offended by the statement of systemic racism in Medford without any acknowledgment of these facts.

3387
04:26:37,436 --> 04:26:41,780
There was looting which destroyed the hopes, dreams, and future of many people in Mass.

3388
04:26:43,461 --> 04:26:44,802
I do believe that this

3389
04:26:45,685 --> 04:26:48,767
was against our country and not about the issues.

3390
04:26:49,488 --> 04:26:52,750
Protesting is legal, but not looting and burning.

3391
04:26:53,651 --> 04:26:56,833
Now there is talk about changing the money the police receive.

3392
04:26:57,994 --> 04:26:59,735
The police budget is for salaries.

3393
04:27:00,296 --> 04:27:04,519
And if there is less money, there'll be less police, which I assume is the goal.

3394
04:27:05,199 --> 04:27:09,822
We would have more people and less order, which to me sounds dangerous.

3395
04:27:10,423 --> 04:27:13,365
Police are a basic functioning for society.

3396
04:27:15,141 --> 04:27:17,783
I do not support taking money from the police budget.

3397
04:27:17,883 --> 04:27:23,766
Okay, now we are told the Columbus School must change its name because certain people are offended.

3398
04:27:24,746 --> 04:27:32,231
I know many people in Medford who grew up here and attended that school and are offended at a possible name change.

3399
04:27:33,031 --> 04:27:38,114
I realized there was a vote, but many people were not aware and had no say in this matter.

3400
04:27:38,814 --> 04:27:43,817
Again, we want to do, but not that I can see for the better for Medford.

3401
04:27:44,534 --> 04:27:58,879
We need to continue to work together to stop all racism, sexism, and violence against Jewish people, but not by blaming or punishing the police, or by causing more dissension among Medford residents by changing certain names.

3402
04:28:00,340 --> 04:28:05,002
Those who are so extreme and want to change Medford into Somersville must be stopped.

3403
04:28:05,982 --> 04:28:10,984
I ask and hope it is possible to address the name change of the Columbus School again.

3404
04:28:11,809 --> 04:28:16,493
in a way that allows a broader range of Medford residents to speak.

3405
04:28:17,554 --> 04:28:18,575
Thank you for listening.

3406
04:28:18,816 --> 04:28:19,616
Thank you, Joyce.

3407
04:28:19,897 --> 04:28:20,697
Councilor Behrs.

3408
04:28:21,758 --> 04:28:22,759
Thank you, Mr. President.

3409
04:28:22,819 --> 04:28:27,503
I just wanted to, you know, systemic racism is real.

3410
04:28:27,564 --> 04:28:29,245
It's a national and a local crisis.

3411
04:28:29,345 --> 04:28:35,611
And I apologize for the false information that was put out there just a moment ago regarding, you know,

3412
04:28:36,431 --> 04:28:40,054
these fake ideas of Black-on-Black crime and all of that.

3413
04:28:40,414 --> 04:28:41,975
You know, that's just ridiculous.

3414
04:28:42,235 --> 04:28:46,538
The reason that crime is the way it is is that our country is segregated and our city is segregated.

3415
04:28:47,519 --> 04:28:50,981
So again, systemic racism is a national and local crisis.

3416
04:28:51,041 --> 04:28:56,585
And for the 146 people who've been here for four and a half hours, sorry that you had to hear that.

3417
04:28:57,385 --> 04:28:59,527
Thank you, Kotzebue, for clarifying.

3418
04:29:01,528 --> 04:29:05,031
Let's see, there was someone,

3419
04:29:06,540 --> 04:29:07,060
Is that everyone?

3420
04:29:07,100 --> 04:29:07,841
I apologize.

3421
04:29:11,922 --> 04:29:13,122
Clerk Herterbeast, did we get everyone?

3422
04:29:16,764 --> 04:29:19,045
I think so, Mr. President, but I can't tell.

3423
04:29:19,065 --> 04:29:22,046
Oh, there's somebody who says Fire Tablet.

3424
04:29:23,646 --> 04:29:24,287
There's a hand up.

3425
04:29:24,907 --> 04:29:27,128
Fire Tablet, name and address for the record, please.

3426
04:29:28,734 --> 04:29:29,995
Sounds like a personnel decision.

3427
04:29:30,035 --> 04:29:30,655
Who's tablet?

3428
04:29:31,596 --> 04:29:32,176
Hi, folks.

3429
04:29:32,276 --> 04:29:32,657
It's me.

3430
04:29:32,697 --> 04:29:34,638
It's Angela Moore at 30 Vine Street.

3431
04:29:36,019 --> 04:29:38,801
Your child loses your iPad in the middle of a pandemic.

3432
04:29:42,243 --> 04:29:42,963
Can you all hear me?

3433
04:29:43,304 --> 04:29:43,984
Yes, we can.

3434
04:29:44,044 --> 04:29:44,705
Please continue.

3435
04:29:45,645 --> 04:29:57,293
So I just wanted to say on a different note that I'm, as someone who has spoken up in Metro politics for a number of years, I'm really happy to see new people and old people

3436
04:29:58,352 --> 04:30:08,566
older people um speaking up and having a voice And having a way to communicate to maybe come together to find the medford that we all believe we deserve um

3437
04:30:10,978 --> 04:30:12,719
I don't know what the answer is for the budget.

3438
04:30:13,460 --> 04:30:21,145
I am afraid that in-person meetings will be dangerous as someone that is at risk.

3439
04:30:22,246 --> 04:30:33,833
And there's so many components that I think we don't understand as not being healthcare professionals or public health professionals that we haven't even taken into consideration.

3440
04:30:36,337 --> 04:30:58,633
as much as I recognize why people want to be in person as much as I recognize why I would like to look someone in the eye when I tell them the decision i'm making um I think we just need to take a step back and recognize that We are still in the middle of a pandemic and while some of us feel like we're living more of a normal life

3441
04:30:59,540 --> 04:31:12,486
Those of us that are still worried about getting sick or making our loved ones sick Or understand that just a simple trip to the grocery store could Bring it home to someone that we live with.

3442
04:31:12,966 --> 04:31:24,911
Um I just ask you all take that into consideration When the decision comes about how this meeting is going to work in the future since our budget is obviously going to have to be passed at some point

3443
04:31:26,140 --> 04:31:27,461
So that's it.

3444
04:31:27,601 --> 04:31:29,082
I appreciate where you're all coming from.

3445
04:31:29,102 --> 04:31:52,035
I do not think being a politician is easy I do not think what any of you are doing right now is easy And I do appreciate that You're sitting there and you're listening and change is not easy and nobody likes to be made feel uncomfortable um, but it is probably a time of reflection for our city and I as one know that i'm trying to take that

3446
04:31:52,850 --> 04:32:00,575
into consideration as I talk to my children and the people I meet and the people I know and my understanding of what Medford is.

3447
04:32:00,675 --> 04:32:02,917
So that's just all I had to say.

3448
04:32:03,637 --> 04:32:05,438
Thanks to everybody who's hung in there this long.

3449
04:32:05,458 --> 04:32:10,902
I am really happy to see that this is where Medford is going.

3450
04:32:10,942 --> 04:32:17,186
And I'm really happy to know that in the future, perhaps people like me won't be the only one sitting alone in city council chambers.

3451
04:32:17,526 --> 04:32:18,207
So that's it.

3452
04:32:18,467 --> 04:32:18,767
Thank you.

3453
04:32:22,122 --> 04:32:23,663
Okay, we also have Clarke-Curtavis.

3454
04:32:23,683 --> 04:32:26,124
I'm sure I haven't missed anybody.

3455
04:32:27,625 --> 04:32:35,290
Well, I'm gonna conclude by just thanking everyone for participating in a public participation portion of our meeting tonight.

3456
04:32:36,011 --> 04:32:38,172
It's all very valuable.

3457
04:32:38,192 --> 04:32:39,893
I appreciate everyone's input.

3458
04:32:40,522 --> 04:32:48,368
I believe the council's probably do as well, but I just wanted to say thank you, especially those who stuck it out to the almost end.

3459
04:32:48,468 --> 04:32:51,570
It's 1137, I have on my clock here, we began at 7 p.m.

3480
04:34:15,768 --> 04:34:21,090
Councilor Knight has raised a concern with some of these written correspondences.

3481
04:34:21,431 --> 04:34:28,393
And he asked me to, he said that upon review, he feels that there were some portions of these correspondences that call into question both his reputation and his character.

3482
04:34:29,073 --> 04:34:36,976
And he invokes his right to have these matters reviewed in an executive session accompanied by council prior to any introduction or discussion thereof by the public body.

3483
04:34:37,916 --> 04:34:38,617
That's fine with me.

Yes.

3598
04:38:59,021 --> 04:38:59,522
Councilor Knight.

3599
04:38:59,963 --> 04:39:00,243
Yes.

3600
04:39:00,584 --> 04:39:01,164
Councilor Marks.

3601
04:39:01,825 --> 04:39:02,126
Yes.

3602
04:39:02,426 --> 04:39:03,047
Councilor Morrell.

3603
04:39:03,708 --> 04:39:03,968
Yes.

3604
04:39:04,309 --> 04:39:05,090
Councilor Scarpelli.

3605
04:39:05,470 --> 04:39:05,731
Yes.

3606
04:39:06,031 --> 04:39:06,752
President Falco.

3607
04:39:07,133 --> 04:39:10,057
Yes, I have the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

3608
04:39:15,269 --> 04:39:24,689
2-0-451 offered by Councilor Morrell, be it resolved that the City Council advance the ordinance establishing a so named Method Women's Slash Gender Equity Commission.

3609
04:39:25,411 --> 04:39:26,012
Councilor Morrell.

3610
04:39:27,206 --> 04:39:28,126
Thank you, Mr. President.

3611
04:39:28,466 --> 04:39:32,467
So this is just a resolution simply to take this paper back up.

3612
04:39:32,947 --> 04:39:41,869
It was originally introduced as 19-312 in the last session to establish a women or gender equity commission in the city of Medford by ordinance.

3613
04:39:42,630 --> 04:39:46,310
So I've gotten much outreach over the past few months about this potential commission.

3614
04:39:46,470 --> 04:39:48,951
And I think now with so many people looking for

3615
04:39:49,535 --> 04:39:55,477
ways that they can be involved in what goes on at City Hall and lead Medford forward in these times.

3616
04:39:55,897 --> 04:40:02,780
I think it's important that we advance it and bring it back to a committee of the whole to work out kind of the final issues around the ordinance.

3617
04:40:02,940 --> 04:40:10,002
There's, of course, the intersectionality of issues of race, gender, and class that this commission would definitely focus on and advance forward.

3618
04:40:10,042 --> 04:40:11,303
And I think it's a much needed

3619
04:40:13,126 --> 04:40:25,654
ordinance at this time, as well as to have these conversations going forward so I it's just a motion to have this taken up at a future committee of the whole console moral Thank you for bringing this forward on this actually is on our list.

3620
04:40:25,914 --> 04:40:27,134
It's still in committee to the whole.

3621
04:40:28,095 --> 04:40:31,337
It has not been forgotten about it just, this has been a busy.

3622
04:40:32,398 --> 04:40:35,740
We've been kind of meeting non stop since the beginning since the term started so um.

3623
04:40:37,207 --> 04:40:37,667
Excuse me.

3624
04:40:37,707 --> 04:40:39,609
So it's still on the list.

3625
04:40:39,629 --> 04:40:40,269
I promise you that.

3626
04:40:40,830 --> 04:40:42,471
And I hope that we can bring it up soon.

3627
04:40:42,491 --> 04:40:45,393
It looks like there's other councils that want to speak on this.

3628
04:40:45,453 --> 04:40:46,294
Councilor Knight.

3629
04:40:47,235 --> 04:40:50,357
I was going to speak on it, but in the interest of time, Mr. President, I'll second the motion.

3630
04:40:50,397 --> 04:40:51,538
We can deal with it in subcommittee.

3631
04:40:51,998 --> 04:40:52,599

The motion passes.

3713
04:43:09,783 --> 04:43:21,995
20-455 offered by Council appears be resolved at the Memphis City Council, create a subcommittee on communications and public engagement, which will discuss matters relating to how the communication, I'm sorry,

3714
04:43:22,640 --> 04:43:39,155
how the council communicates with Method residents, updates improvements to council communications procedures, and engaging the public to ensure that public participation with council business occurs in an equitable and inclusive manner for all residents and communities in our city.

3715
04:43:39,695 --> 04:43:40,416
Councilor Behrs.

3716
04:43:41,637 --> 04:43:42,618
Thank you, Mr. President.

3717
04:43:43,706 --> 04:43:51,491
you know, I think it's an apt item to be on the agenda for tonight after four and a half hours of public participation that I think overall went very well.

3718
04:43:52,151 --> 04:44:01,977
But one of the biggest pieces of feedback I've been hearing in the past couple of weeks at the Human Rights Commission meeting, and just from residents in general is, how can we, and I think we heard it tonight too, right?

3719
04:44:02,017 --> 04:44:02,918
You know, how can we make it

3720
04:44:03,402 --> 04:44:13,925
clear and easier and provide guidance and help for people to participate in our meetings and participate in city government and make sure that we're doing that in a way that breaks down barriers that might exist right now.

3721
04:44:13,945 --> 04:44:29,489
I think that would be the intent of this resolution and the subcommittee is to have a group of us, hopefully of different minds on issues like this to come together and say, here are some ways that we could work together, work with the clerk's office, work with the city administration to make sure that

3722
04:44:29,876 --> 04:44:35,219
things are posted in a clear and equitable manner on the city website, and that kind of thing.

3723
04:44:35,399 --> 04:44:39,241
So that is my resolution and the intent of it.

3724
04:44:39,301 --> 04:44:39,642
Thank you.

3725
04:44:40,302 --> 04:44:41,343
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

3726
04:44:42,083 --> 04:44:45,305
Okay, we have a number of, let's see, Councilor Morrell, and then Councilor Knight.

3727
04:44:45,325 --> 04:44:46,045
Councilor Morrell.

3728
04:44:46,706 --> 04:44:47,606
Thank you, Mr. President.

3729
04:44:47,646 --> 04:44:49,407
Yeah, I just want to echo Councilor Behrs.

3730
04:44:49,707 --> 04:44:59,413
For those who were able to attend the conversation on racism event online last week, this is something that came up repeatedly, issues with communication as far as them needing to be more equitable,

3731
04:44:59,866 --> 04:45:05,248
and just a first step to making sure voices are heard from the community.

3732
04:45:05,888 --> 04:45:21,512
So if this council is about action, this is a great first action we can take to really address some of the inequities that exist and not to call anyone out, but to the gentleman who struggled to find tonight's council agenda on the website, so did I. So there's obviously a lot of room for improvement.

3733
04:45:21,552 --> 04:45:22,993
So I look forward to that and I support this.

3734
04:45:23,193 --> 04:45:23,493
Thank you.

3735
04:45:23,873 --> 04:45:24,953
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

3736
04:45:24,973 --> 04:45:25,613

3757
04:46:04,261 --> 04:46:13,127
Create a user-friendly... Mr. President, we lost you.

3758
04:46:14,067 --> 04:46:16,989
John, we just lost you.

3759
04:46:17,550 --> 04:46:18,690
Table it.

3760
04:46:18,750 --> 04:46:19,030
Okay.

3761
04:46:19,391 --> 04:46:20,271
Did you get any of that?

3762
04:46:22,555 --> 04:46:26,078
Okay, 20-456 offered by Councilor Beers.

3763
04:46:26,998 --> 04:46:36,806
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council create a user-friendly guide for public participation that is translated into multiple languages and is easily accessible on the city website.

3764

3766
04:47:04,047 --> 04:47:04,987
Thank you, Mr. President.

3767
04:47:05,007 --> 04:47:11,690
I mean, I think these are actions along the lines of potentially what the subcommittee I proposed would do, but I would just,

3768
04:47:12,578 --> 04:47:13,219
I think they're good.

3769
04:47:13,239 --> 04:47:15,781
I think they're clear low-hanging fruit actions that we can take.

3770
04:47:16,281 --> 04:47:21,406
I would make a motion to send this to committee of the whole as well for the same discussion as the subcommittee.

3771
04:47:22,086 --> 04:47:22,367
Second.

3772

04:48:02,711 --> 04:48:03,732
Thank you, Mr. President.

I put together an hour presentation for this.

3793
04:48:07,094 --> 04:48:08,495
So I hope you guys would indulge me.

3794
04:48:10,557 --> 04:48:11,577
Got the popcorn, hold on.

3795
04:48:12,577 --> 04:48:13,318
That was a joke.

3796
04:48:13,398 --> 04:48:13,998
That was a joke.

3797
04:48:14,538 --> 04:48:20,739
Mr. President, as we know, over the last month or so, that outdoor dining has opened up in this community.

3798
04:48:20,759 --> 04:48:34,182
And there's been a lot of interest and suggestions how to use some of our major thoroughfares to assist local businesses and restaurants in using up some of the space in order to put outside dining.

3799
04:48:34,842 --> 04:48:39,423
The Mass Department of Transportation just released their Shared Streets and Spaces grant.

3800
04:48:40,183 --> 04:48:44,406
And it's a $300,000, up to $300,000 available.

3801
04:48:45,106 --> 04:48:56,094
And the COVID-19 has highlighted some existing mobility needs, as well as the need for meaningful commerce to now be safely conducted on sidewalks and streets.

3802
04:48:58,276 --> 04:49:05,166
The improvements include streets, curbs, sidewalks, on-street parking spaces, and off-street parking lots.

3803
04:49:05,767 --> 04:49:11,715
Improvements can be intentionally temporary or pilots of potentially permanent change.

3804
04:49:12,536 --> 04:49:23,620
uh applications and the reason why I brought this up tonight Mr. President applications are being accepted as of June 22nd on a first come first serve basis to September 29th.

3805
04:49:24,120 --> 04:49:33,283
I would ask Mr. President that we take a vote to ask the city administration to expedite and apply for this particular grant

3806
04:49:33,763 --> 04:49:54,234
for Shared Streets and Spaces Grant, Mr. President, in the interest of outdoor dining, and also in the interest, Mr. President, in assisting those small establishments that may not have the capacity, Mr. President, to make outdoor dining a reality, and this would definitely help out.

3807
04:49:55,574 --> 04:49:56,295
Thank you, Councilor.

3808
04:49:56,395 --> 04:49:56,915
Approved.

3809
04:49:57,415 --> 04:49:57,775

3814
04:50:10,095 --> 04:50:10,895
Thank you, Mr. President.

3815
04:50:10,915 --> 04:50:13,456
Yeah, I just want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

3816
04:50:13,516 --> 04:50:26,241
I think this is a great opportunity to support our local businesses and their efforts for outdoor safe dining, and then also a great way to reimagine Medford and get some ideas to make us a much more multimodal city.

3817
04:50:26,361 --> 04:50:27,362
So I support this.

3818
04:50:27,762 --> 04:50:28,062
Thank you.

3819
04:50:28,562 --> 04:50:29,943

I second what both Councilor Marks and Councilor Morrell said.

3822
04:50:34,748 --> 04:50:39,250
And I just wanted to add, this came across, I get the state house news service.

3823
04:50:39,590 --> 04:50:40,731
It came across my desk.

3824
04:50:40,771 --> 04:50:43,412
I immediately forwarded it to the mayor's office.

3825
04:50:43,452 --> 04:50:47,274
And I know that they have been working as well to take advantage of this program in some way.

3826
04:50:47,294 --> 04:50:48,735
I don't know if they've applied.

3827
04:50:48,835 --> 04:50:52,577
So that's why I strongly support this, but I at least know they were interested.

3828
04:50:52,637 --> 04:50:55,699
So I hope that this is just a win-win-win for Medford.

3829
04:50:55,959 --> 04:50:56,299
Thank you.

3830
04:50:57,140 --> 04:50:57,460
