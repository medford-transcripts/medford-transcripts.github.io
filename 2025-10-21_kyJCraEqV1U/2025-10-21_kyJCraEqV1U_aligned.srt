00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:23,461
Now, that change might seem small, but it represents dozens of students not crossing the stage.

00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:31,463
For our high-need students, those battling language, income, learning challenges, the drop is even deeper.

00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,055
Data tells us who's falling through the cracks.

00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:40,661
