[SPEAKER_21]: First item.

00:01:56,634 --> 00:02:01,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I should say as well while we're going through names and faces.

25

[SPEAKER_21]: Amanda city staff perhaps you could mention for us, those who are in attendance this evening.

[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Amanda.

32
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:58,569
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple items on for this evening the first and an important one citywide for all of us is the comprehensive plan presentation from the group that has put that plan together over so many months and through so much effort on our behalf and presentation from them and then we'll have some discussion and perhaps a vote to adopt the plan on the city's behalf.

33
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:03,653
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'll turn it over to the presenters, including some friendly faces.

34
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:09,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

35
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:10,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everyone.

36
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:18,962
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited to share the plan, the revised plan that has had a lot of feedback and revisions to date shared with you.

37
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:23,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to see if Alicia or Amanda want to say anything before we jump in.

38
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:30,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

39
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:34,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to thank everybody for all the hard work on the plan.

40
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:41,342
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a very engaged, uh, group advisory group that's been involved in this.

41
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:43,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I see some of the members here this evening.

42
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:55,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, actually, Councilors Caraviello and Councilor Bears, who both joined us this evening, were on the advisory board, um, as well as, um, some of the others, um, Tom Lincoln, Bonnie,

43
00:03:56,693 --> 00:04:04,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Rick Orlando, I'm seeing, I hope I didn't forget anybody that I'm actually seeing here in the room this evening, the virtual room.

44
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:11,057
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's been a lot of work and we've gotten a lot of input as I'm sure the consultants will be sharing with us.

45
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:15,019
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to thank everybody for their hard work on this.

46
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thank you.

47
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,581
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll go ahead and dive in.

48
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:40,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Annie, who I understand is familiar to you all, is going to share the screen, and you'll hear from myself, Brie Hensel, that agency, Annie, who also reached us and joined us from a circuitous planning route, and Emily Innes with Innes Associates.

49
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:44,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll hear from each of us to share parts and pieces of the plan.

50
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,051
[SPEAKER_09]: And nice to see you all, and nice to be back.

51
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:49,712
[SPEAKER_21]: Welcome.

52
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, thank you so much for having us.

53
00:04:53,354 --> 00:05:00,156
[SPEAKER_03]: We know this is a really important plan for the city, and also we hope it will be a useful tool for you all in the years to come as well.

54
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:20,562
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope tonight to share some updates that have changed to the plan, thanks to a lot of community feedback, staff pouring over the plan, feedback from boards and commissions and city council that have led to some updates since we last met with you in July, I believe.

55
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:40,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just echo Alicia's huge thank you to the steering committee who was really fun to work with, fun, passionate, passionate for Medford, passionate for the plan, really had lots of great ideas about every kind of nook and cranny and different facet that we talked about.

56
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:44,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So they really helped to create and co-create this plan.

57
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we captured everyone.

58
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:48,999
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to see the faces in the room from the steering committee.

59
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:49,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's been a while.

60
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:58,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to mention also Jackie Furtado, who I saw, who I know wears so many hats, but was always with us, really thoughtful in the steering committee too.

61
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:20,750
[SPEAKER_03]: The team beyond me included a few other planners from Agency Landscape and Planning, a data visualization and community engagement specialist who helped us get over a thousand comments on an online map, as well as created some informational videos, Chris Landau,

62
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:29,154
[SPEAKER_03]: We had local transportation planners from Arab, and then we also had CARP strategies diving into economic development and housing.

63
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was kind of really a comprehensive team to think about the different pieces of the plan.

64
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:54,863
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been working on this with you and with the steering committee since about spring of 2021 guided by a lot of community engagement along the way, a lot of fun workshops with the steering committee, and then just about the time that we saw you in July is when we were releasing for public input.

65
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,505
[SPEAKER_03]: the first draft of the plan itself.

66
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:03,689
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was shared with the steering committee, with the community, and with a lot of workshops internally.

67
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:14,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the last about six months, we've been receiving those comments, making sure that there's a lot of ample time for feedback and review and re-review.

68
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:17,779
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've now revised that draft.

69
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:22,122
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll show you some of the changes, kind of walk through that, and then walk through the shape of the plan.

70
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:30,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk a little bit about what this comprehensive plan is meant to do, why it's happening in the first place.

71
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:45,986
[SPEAKER_03]: It's guided and directed by Massachusetts General Laws, and it's governed by Chapter 41, Section 81D, which generally says that the plan will address the nine different elements, which include the different topical areas that you see at the bottom,

72
00:07:46,516 --> 00:08:00,045
[SPEAKER_03]: everything from land use to history to mobility, and also make sure that the plan has goals, makes policy statements, and lays out an implementation plan so that these ideas can be achieved and incorporated to city practices.

73
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:09,612
[SPEAKER_03]: It's meant to be high level because of its comprehensive nature, and it's meant to be implemented through other studies that drill down or through kind of internal initiatives.

74
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:13,675
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's meant to be this vision that ties together a lot of community feedback

75
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:16,956
[SPEAKER_03]: into a cohesive shared picture of the future.

76
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately, the idea is that the plan will lay out a 10 year action plan.

77
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:36,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we get into the implementation plan, you'll start to see really tangible ideas, really tangible actions that hopefully will be accomplished and kind of taken on as initiatives in the coming years.

78
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,248
[SPEAKER_03]: But then it also looks at this 30 year planning horizon when it defines the vision goal statements for what Medford wants to be in the future.

79
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:52,594
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to set out policies that will give direction to city departments, talks about investment.

80
00:08:52,694 --> 00:08:58,320
[SPEAKER_03]: So thinking about capital investment, capital improvements, where to spend operating funds.

81
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,481
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we heard a lot about was

82
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:05,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this plan is full of great ideas, but who's going to do it?

83
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We need staff and resources.

84
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's something we've thought a lot about on the implementation side.

85
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:11,722
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll share some more of that.

86
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,883
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really thinks about needed staff, needed investment and partnerships.

87
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:21,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It sets you up for regulatory changes that can make some of this possible.

88
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:26,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's meant also to make a pathway for ongoing community discussions.

89
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:31,630
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a lot of great conversations that started in this process that we hope will carry forward.

90
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:45,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So since we last saw you in July, what has been happening we've had about over 600 comments on the draft plan and total a really deep dive from city staff, which was.

91
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:58,343
[SPEAKER_03]: really helpful, the folks who are going to implement this, who know kind of on the ground, how pieces will come together, what's possible, what's feasible, where ambitions should be higher or adjusted.

92
00:09:58,743 --> 00:10:01,064
[SPEAKER_03]: We got over 400 from city staff.

93
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:06,546
[SPEAKER_03]: We got 125 comments from residents, almost 100 unique online views.

94
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:14,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So really great that people were engaging with the plan, giving feedback, and we've gone line by line through all of those different

95
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,681
[SPEAKER_03]: different points of feedback.

96
00:10:18,382 --> 00:10:24,672
[SPEAKER_03]: This team, Alicia and Amanda and her team really considered everyone and tried to address them in the plan.

97
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:30,224
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll show you a few of the bigger picture changes.

98
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,907
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that shifted with some of the feedback was actually the order of the chapters.

99
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:41,190
[SPEAKER_03]: We started before always with opening and engaged communication, which really felt like this sort of overarching picture.

100
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:53,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've now moved up from the end to second, welcoming and supportive neighborhoods, because that was really such a resounding idea that came through from community engagement, as well as feedback.

101
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:57,339
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to make sure it was front and center, what people see when they first open the plan.

102
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:11,758
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have made some changes for usability so are highlighting kind of the topical areas and functional areas, as we go through the different goals and actions you can understand this might affect housing in the city this might affect.

103
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,914
[SPEAKER_03]: economic development, it might affect history.

104
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:23,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not only meant to kind of organize things, but also to be call outs to advocacy groups or partners or passionate volunteers about open space.

105
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:29,218
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kind of quickly at a glance, figure out which recommendations align with what you're working on.

106
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:39,841
[SPEAKER_03]: We introduced a section up front to orient people to the different areas within Medford that we refer to a lot.

107
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're calling this places,

108
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:43,682
[SPEAKER_03]: References to places and areas.

109
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:47,363
[SPEAKER_03]: It's meant to kind of make sure people know geographically.

110
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,264
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we saying when we say hillside?

111
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:51,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we talking about?

112
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:59,106
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure just everyone has kind of a level understanding of how the city is knit together by these different neighborhoods.

113
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:10,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the kind of meatier content side, as we got into the implementation chapter, that's probably changed and grown quite a bit from what you saw before.

114
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:18,634
[SPEAKER_03]: got a lot of really good feedback about the implementation chapter and kind of what was needed to set up the city for success.

115
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:28,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And the chapter now really emphasizes the need for investment in staff and administrative resources, whether those human resources or space.

116
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:30,935
[SPEAKER_03]: to support implementation.

117
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:42,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It also digs into the relationship and the strategy between having a relationship between economic development, infrastructure investments, and generating more tax revenue so you can make all of this happen.

118
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:01,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Should I keep going?

119
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:02,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll keep going.

120
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:03,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

121
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:04,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

122
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:09,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, it identifies priority actions and first steps.

123
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:20,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do we start, including some recommendations for zoning, how might you attack kind of thinking about different zoning changes, and then future land use actions.

124
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:29,310
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we get further into the presentation, Emily is gonna dive into the implementation chapter and share that with you too.

125
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:40,700
[SPEAKER_03]: What didn't change is that the plan is still really driven by all the feedback that we received, not just in the last six months, but in the whole kind of 18 months of the plan itself.

126
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of the in-person engagement, website and digital engagement and the focus groups.

127
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:49,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So really grateful for all of that direction.

128
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:57,652
[SPEAKER_03]: What that did was it set us up to understand patterns of city values and needs.

129
00:13:57,732 --> 00:14:09,558
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see we heard about special places, a lot of those on the river, some issues, many of those on roads, and then ideas, many of those in Medford Square, but really in all the neighborhoods across the city.

130
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to brainstorm some of these place-based improvements and understand how the policies

131
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:28,953
[SPEAKER_03]: The capital improvements, the ideas in here will make a difference on the ground in the experience of the city for residents in years to come.

132
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:46,764
[SPEAKER_03]: So ultimately what we'll show you now, we'll walk through these five plan themes that were shaped by that community feedback, open and engaged communication, a welcoming and supportive community, vibrant places, access for all and climate resiliency.

133
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are really the pillars of the plan, and they also shape that long-term, like we said, 30-year vision.

134
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,364
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that, I'll pass it back to our friend and yours, Annie.

135
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:03,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

136
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:04,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Brie.

137
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:20,690
[SPEAKER_09]: So before we get into kind of the five themes, we wanted to take a bit of a step back and I'll move pretty quickly through this since there's a lot of overlap with what we shared with you all last summer and also since you've been sitting with the plan.

138
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:27,687
[SPEAKER_09]: but thinking about the fact that Medford has done a lot of planning work at different levels and on different topics.

139
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:36,173
[SPEAKER_09]: And so part of the role of this plan is to really bring together current and past plans and to understand how these components relate holistically to one another.

140
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:46,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we looked at the history of land use and development in Medford and considered that together with current trends and citywide patterns.

141
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:48,382
[SPEAKER_09]: And then

142
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,546
[SPEAKER_09]: projecting that out to the future.

143
00:15:50,886 --> 00:16:02,214
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this is sort of, the future land use map is this diagrammatic way of thinking about the different areas in Medford and the strategies this plan has for addressing those areas.

144
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:17,225
[SPEAKER_09]: So here you can see some highlighted elements such as the green corridor along the rivers, gateway entries to the city shown there in blue, civic and institutional anchors, those centers and squares of economic activity,

145
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:21,254
[SPEAKER_09]: and then also kind of smaller, more village centers at the neighborhood scale.

146
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:28,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And so thinking about how all these different areas of investment and a different character relate to one another and what they look like in the future.

147
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:44,485
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, as Brie mentioned, the five building blocks really came out of community engagement and input, and all of these were themes that were refined over the course of this process.

148
00:16:45,657 --> 00:16:55,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And these were open and engaged communication, welcoming and supportive neighborhoods, vibrant places, access for all, and climate resiliency.

149
00:16:57,147 --> 00:17:08,096
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll dig into those just a little bit to provide a high level overview of what these look like, but there are many more actions and elements within the chapters themselves.

150
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:13,240
[SPEAKER_09]: So I encourage everyone to take a closer look and looking forward to discussion with you all after this.

151
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:31,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So first, open and engaged communication, and this includes the relationship between the community and City Hall, how plans like these get implemented over time, allocation of funding, and how the City relates to other potential partners who can help to implement elements of this plan.

152
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:43,592
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of the goals that came out here were to grow and strengthen community trust, to implement the plan according to community-supported priorities,

153
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:50,018
[SPEAKER_09]: and also allocating resources effectively to make sure that this plan can be effective going forward.

154
00:17:50,038 --> 00:18:10,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And so just to highlight a few of the actions that are contained in this chapter, the plan recommends issuing an annual comprehensive plan update that will show progress made on the plan and really create that transparency with the community about actions that have been taken.

155
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:13,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Offering communication and training to

156
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:39,594
[SPEAKER_09]: residents and staff, including mediation training and thinking about how we're communicating with the rest of the community, tracking participation demographics in planning processes and on boards to really see who's in the room and how we can expand the reach of both membership of boards and commissions, but also of who's engaged in public processes.

157
00:18:41,924 --> 00:18:44,945
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also identifying partners who can help to implement this plan.

158
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:48,807
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a lot of actions and recommendations and steps in here.

159
00:18:48,887 --> 00:19:00,331
[SPEAKER_09]: So how can the city now do this alone and thinking about how to strategically allocate some of these steps to some supporting organizations and partners.

160
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:07,394
[SPEAKER_09]: So the second building block or theme is a welcoming and supportive community.

161
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:08,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And so,

162
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:17,661
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the big goals here is ensuring affordable housing for all and housing was a big theme that came forth throughout the engagement process.

163
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:28,745
[SPEAKER_09]: As Brie mentioned, part of moving this chapter up in the structure of the plan was really to emphasize kind of the weight of that piece within the plan and the emphasis on that.

164
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:40,470
[SPEAKER_09]: And this plan builds a lot on the housing production plan that was recently completed, but really emphasizing that the affordable housing goal is a main component of this plan.

165
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:57,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Another goal within this theme is enlivening open spaces and facilities and really having those Medford's abundant open space, really leveraging that and making it be the most welcoming and supportive and engaging places that they can be.

166
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:08,977
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also honoring Medford's rich history, roots and culture that are really present throughout the neighborhoods and how we can bring those to the forefront and think about how to leverage those resources.

167
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:34,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And so highlighting a few examples of actions here, diversifying housing options by allowing multifamily and small diverse housing options through zoning changes, retrofitting existing facilities for universal accessibility, and beautifying centers by working with local artists to highlight history and culture.

168
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:41,435
[SPEAKER_09]: So kind of that mix of addressing affordability and open space and

169
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:44,345
[SPEAKER_11]: and history and arts and culture.

170
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:50,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the third theme or building block is cyberplaces.

171
00:20:51,708 --> 00:21:02,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And this relates to economic development and land use and open space and how these work together to kind of create a more vibrant and active community.

172
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:15,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And a few goals here were something that was heard a lot in engagement was about creating these live and work communities in Bedford and sort of the 12 and 18 hour communities.

173
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:24,525
[SPEAKER_09]: So having something to do and extending the hours of when these resources are available and activities happening in centers.

174
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:28,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Also supporting businesses and the workforce.

175
00:21:28,146 --> 00:21:31,108
[SPEAKER_09]: So through workforce training and making sure that

176
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:43,058
[SPEAKER_09]: economic development growth in Medford supports Medford residents and the members of the community are prepared with the skills and resources for that growth.

177
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:51,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And then increasing the enjoyment of natural resources, also within this by replacement element and balancing growth.

178
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:51,922
[SPEAKER_09]: So really seeing

179
00:21:53,033 --> 00:22:05,722
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the areas that are appropriate for growth and how to balance that with investment in infrastructure and transportation to really make sure that the investments needed are in place to support that growth.

180
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:13,927
[SPEAKER_11]: So a few actions here that we'll highlight are

181
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:19,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Leveraging city-owned parcels to develop and promote multi-family residential.

182
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:25,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Attracting companies that will provide well-being jobs to residents in Bedford.

183
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:34,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And encouraging that small-scale neighborhood retail and services to provide services within neighborhoods and those walkable communities.

184
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:42,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So then the fourth theme or building block here is access for all.

185
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:48,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And this relates to mobility and facilities and services and how people get around the community.

186
00:22:49,821 --> 00:23:02,248
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the goals here relate to connecting multi-mobile networks and building on recent investments that have been made and really creating the connections between where people want to go in Medford.

187
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:12,915
[SPEAKER_09]: As I mentioned a bit with Fiber Police is to coordinating that mobility and development so that where growth is happening, there is the transportation infrastructure to support it.

188
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:16,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And then improving the mobility experience for all users.

189
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:28,473
[SPEAKER_09]: So from pedestrians and bikers to transit users and universal accessibility, really making sure that experience is improved for everyone.

190
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:39,977
[SPEAKER_09]: So a couple of actions that I'll highlight here are auditing pedestrian crossings and school adjacent routes for safe crossings.

191
00:23:41,054 --> 00:24:03,280
[SPEAKER_09]: working with the ongoing bicycle master plan update to really create a safe and well-connected network for all users, promoting density and mixed use and walking distance of MBTA train stations and major bus hubs, and then also determining how to integrate currently unaccepted streets into the city ownership, since that was a topic that came up a lot in engagement.

192
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:13,821
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally, and we sort of move this to the end, not because it's not important, but because it's sort of looking ahead to the future.

193
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:21,525
[SPEAKER_09]: And also it's building on so much work that the city is already doing with the climate action and adaptation plan.

194
00:24:22,785 --> 00:24:29,708
[SPEAKER_09]: And so climate resilience goals within the plan include raising community awareness about the impacts of climate change.

195
00:24:30,794 --> 00:24:37,658
[SPEAKER_09]: really achieving and evolving the climate action and adaptation plan so that it's time to support implementation of that plan.

196
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:48,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Preserving and enhancing my current existing natural resources to really leverage those existing assets, and then supporting community health and resilience.

197
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:50,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So really

198
00:24:50,835 --> 00:25:05,206
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to create the resources necessary to support the Metric community and in particular, environmental justice communities or communities who are at greater risk of negative impacts and climate change.

199
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:19,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And so a few key examples here of actions to highlight are using streets and open spaces for stormwater management, focusing public tree investments in priority areas like places of high heat vulnerability,

200
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:28,240
[SPEAKER_09]: adopting environmental performance standards for large projects, and updating flood resilience and cool surface design guidelines and standards.

201
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:35,366
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that, I will turn it over to Emily to talk about our implementation section.

202
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:38,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Annie, and can you all hear me?

203
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:40,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

204
00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:46,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as you can see there are a lot of wonderful ideas that came out of the public process.

205
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:56,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also brought in best practices as we tried to bring the ideas together and figure out ways of categorizing them I think Annie took you through.

206
00:25:57,237 --> 00:26:12,335
[SPEAKER_01]: both the, the breakdown of the goals and what we're looking to do based on the comments, but also how some of them apply to the city throughout that's the geographic basis, the implementation plan is a little bit different and if you'll slip to the next slide.

207
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:34,752
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really figuring out how do you take all these ideas, how do you put them into a framework, not just the themes that Annie went through, but in the form of a plan that the CDB, that the city council, the mayor, other people, other groups, other departments can bring forward and start to implement.

208
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:45,477
[SPEAKER_01]: The beginning of the implementation section is these high level categories of how do you get the people and the other resources together that can do implementation.

209
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:51,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how do you think of prioritization obviously from the city's point of view.

210
00:26:52,519 --> 00:27:01,683
[SPEAKER_01]: One idea is the how economic development aligns throughout because economic development has such an impact on everything else that can happen in the plan.

211
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:13,272
[SPEAKER_01]: But from your point of view, the idea of land use and zoning changes and they're scattered throughout the document, but the implementation plan brings them together and we'll talk about those a little bit as we move forward.

212
00:27:13,713 --> 00:27:19,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, every comprehensive plan will also because of the level of comprehensive plan is at.

213
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,661
[SPEAKER_01]: it will identify additional studies that need to be done.

214
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:33,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And the important thing about those additional studies is how do we think about continuing to engage the people who have been engaged with the process so far, right?

215
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:41,357
[SPEAKER_01]: This plan set a standard and actually in this case, this plan followed along from work that the city had already begun to do

216
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:48,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And really built on that future studies will continue to build and improve the community engagement.

217
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,142
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump into a little bit more detail about the implementation plan and we're going to start off with the zoning strategies.

218
00:27:55,062 --> 00:28:04,666
[SPEAKER_01]: One key piece as we heard input back from the first draft is, we need to know more about prioritization and so in the implementation plan.

219
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:19,702
[SPEAKER_01]: We've set it up so that you can see how to really begin thinking about zoning changes from the step of you've completed your recodification as with any recodification there's always some minor tweaks coming out.

220
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:33,419
[SPEAKER_01]: You're working right now on bringing your, your zoning map from having been a mile hour into a digital format, which has been ongoing and really refining that and bringing that forward.

221
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:37,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with those updates, it's time to think about the next steps.

222
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:44,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that we've recommended in talking with city staff is the idea that as zoning changes are made,

223
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:50,231
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing forward policy statements that explain why the zoning change was made.

224
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:54,533
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it that the city was trying to accomplish with that?

225
00:28:54,934 --> 00:29:02,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And that idea of thinking about policies and zoning fits very neatly with the next couple of recommendations.

226
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:14,205
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to really develop a research-based practice of looking what other communities have done in terms of best practices to address zoning changes and zoning change

227
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:29,755
[SPEAKER_01]: processes, how do you bring the public along, get their input, do something that zoning changes that reflect the values of the community as well as the needs of the city, those should really be combined and so there's best practices around that.

228
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:39,022
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a set of priorities for the next steps in looking at the different neighborhoods and areas that were identified as important during this plan.

229
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:51,226
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've suggested a topical way of looking at that you can see that on the left hand side, different topics that are threaded throughout this document that could be addressed by zoning changes.

230
00:29:51,626 --> 00:30:01,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also suggested a way of prioritizing them by geography so that's the specific neighborhoods quarters squares that needed additional attention.

231
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,070
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think of the

232
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:09,473
[SPEAKER_01]: comprehensive plan is sort of up here, now we need to get down to the level of those neighborhoods and centers.

233
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:16,436
[SPEAKER_01]: So that prioritization for zoning really looks at what can happen quickly, and what needs to happen going forward.

234
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:17,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Next slide, Annie.

235
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:38,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So another component, and this is coming out more and more in community planning processes is before when you did, you know, the earlier stages of an implementation was you just listed the action, and then it became no you need to do the action, the partners, the timeline and we're going to talk about how this implementation

236
00:30:39,514 --> 00:30:40,675
[SPEAKER_01]: plan does all of those.

237
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:48,018
[SPEAKER_01]: But now best practices for community planning is really about establishing benchmarks for measuring the success of the plan.

238
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:59,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in this case, the idea of getting the relevant departments together and understanding what are their goals, what are the goals for different city boards and committees,

239
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:04,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how do you measure that those goals or those actions have been successfully implemented?

240
00:31:05,126 --> 00:31:11,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've given an example here of how you might do that for neighborhoods that are more welcoming and supportive.

241
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:13,189
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know that you've done that?

242
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:16,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we see an increase in certain trends, right?

243
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,793
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be housing units, historic designations, we see

244
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:27,097
[SPEAKER_01]: an increase in diversity, we see an increase in children who live within a 10 minute walk of a playground.

245
00:31:28,238 --> 00:31:32,501
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a decrease in the percentage of population that is housing cost burden.

246
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:38,865
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the idea of figuring out initially, what are the trends that spell success, and then for some things,

247
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:58,879
[SPEAKER_01]: As you go forward with implementing the plan you may want to establish specific metrics you may want to say, it's not enough that our housing units are increasing we want to increase our housing units by this amount or affordable housing units by this amount and that's really a department by department conversation.

248
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:08,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And so another way of doing that is what was the impact of the work that we as a city are doing?

249
00:32:09,022 --> 00:32:23,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's an example, you can see by the colored dots here of a way of thinking about how you can take a single area and measure the impact of the plan by seeing how many of the goals have actually been applied to the area, right?

250
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:30,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So if all of these things have been completed or a portion of these things have been completed, then you know that you're really addressing

251
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:34,240
[SPEAKER_01]: the needs of that particular area of Medford.

252
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:41,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the plan breaks these down as ways to think about the fact that you're making progress.

253
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:43,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Next slide, please, Annie.

254
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:48,840
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two sections that I want to sort of call your attention to.

255
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got two ways of reading these sections.

256
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:54,904
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is the objectives and actions.

257
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:56,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And Annie hit those at a very high level.

258
00:32:56,965 --> 00:32:59,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see how they work through thematically.

259
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:06,090
[SPEAKER_01]: What you'll do when you go to the plan itself is you'll see how these are broken down.

260
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:12,313
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see the goal, you see the supporting goal, the sub goal underneath.

261
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:15,615
[SPEAKER_01]: the objection for that goal, and then the specific actions.

262
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:26,581
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are laid out so you can see the real details behind why these goals are important and how each of the actions or the objectives support those goals.

263
00:33:27,442 --> 00:33:36,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in this case, certainly on this page and many others, there are quotes from the community engagement that are directly associated with these goals.

264
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you go to the next slide, please,

265
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:43,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great, we've got those listings, those came out.

266
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:55,784
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we get into the components I mentioned earlier, that idea of who's doing this, you know, how did they get started, how do we track progress, and where do we go for funding.

267
00:33:56,024 --> 00:33:59,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, if you go to the next slide.

268
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,891
[SPEAKER_01]: The next piece is this table.

269
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:08,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we've used this slide to show how to read the table, but basically it'll show you the goal.

270
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:12,900
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll show you the actions, who the partners are.

271
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them are city departments, which is where we get back to that idea of, do we have the right amount of staff?

272
00:34:19,045 --> 00:34:23,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the staff have the right resources to do what they need to do to achieve these goals?

273
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:26,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are boards, committees.

274
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:32,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the partners are not, in fact, city groups.

275
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:38,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may have a city steward, the lead department or the lead position for an action.

276
00:34:39,175 --> 00:34:46,378
[SPEAKER_01]: And then partners may be other city departments, but they may also be institutions or nonprofits or other people who have

277
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:53,868
[SPEAKER_01]: a vested interest in the success of that action being completed or expertise in that particular task.

278
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:58,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, some of the arts-based organizations

279
00:35:00,293 --> 00:35:03,956
[SPEAKER_01]: may be partners for some of the arts based actions.

280
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:11,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a list of projects that the city is working on now, you don't plan in a vacuum.

281
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:18,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this gives an idea of what's been done to date, and it helps with what should be the next steps.

282
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,207
[SPEAKER_01]: The next slide please.

283
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,671
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an overview of implementation.

284
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:29,934
[SPEAKER_01]: This idea that the beginning of the section lays out some of the priorities, especially for this board.

285
00:35:30,014 --> 00:35:36,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the comprehensive plan is a planning document for the CDB, as well as for the city.

286
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:42,459
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives you some ideas, particularly on the zoning and the land use, but also on other components and how they work together.

287
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,421
[SPEAKER_01]: You see how the tables work for identifying all of the actions.

288
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:50,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's really a chance for us to say, thank you.

289
00:35:51,763 --> 00:36:02,727
[SPEAKER_01]: both to the CDB obviously for working with us and for all of the many people, the steering committee, all of the people who took time out to provide comments.

290
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:11,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Under section 81D, the CDB is the city's planning board, of course, and it is responsible for adopting the plan.

291
00:36:11,591 --> 00:36:17,713
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd love to talk to you, you know, any questions or discussion you'd like to have on this tonight.

292
00:36:18,313 --> 00:36:20,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just next slide quickly, Annie.

293
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did we want to do this now?

294
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:28,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure if you'd have the link in time.

295
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:30,125
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

296
00:36:30,226 --> 00:36:36,630
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that's remaining to be swapped is that order of the chapters and the graphic of the implementation table.

297
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:39,673
[SPEAKER_09]: So Alicia, we might leave it up to you.

298
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:45,897
[SPEAKER_09]: If you think the video is final, it just needs that replacement swap out of the implementation page.

299
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,118
[SPEAKER_09]: And that should happen any day now.

300
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:54,372
[SPEAKER_09]: We just have it here in case it would be helpful and we can sort of share it around after the fact as well once we have that updated literacy.

301
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:57,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would be fun to show it.

302
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:59,096
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like two minutes.

303
00:36:59,837 --> 00:37:00,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

304
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:02,380
[SPEAKER_21]: I think everyone enjoys a good video.

305
00:37:03,377 --> 00:37:17,546
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should say this is from our incredibly talented partner, Landau Designs, who has been working with us on all of the community engagement, the earlier videos that we had, the map that drew so many comments.

306
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:20,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the board's permission, I think we'd love to show it.

307
00:37:20,668 --> 00:37:21,188
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do it.

308
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:24,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And a guest voice.

309
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,091
[SPEAKER_11]: A familiar guest voice, yes.

310
00:37:31,658 --> 00:37:34,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll turn it to you after the video to finish up.

311
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:35,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

312
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:39,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Annie is just getting the audio set up so audio can share as well.

313
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:39,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

314
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:57,592
[SPEAKER_01]: So while Annie's doing that, I'll just say that the next steps is this, just because the document is finished, doesn't mean that the work is done from the CD board's perspective.

315
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:11,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously you have the right to, or the obligation to review, and if you're happy with it, to adopt the plan, but it still needs support from everyone who's been involved with the process so far to do the implementation work.

316
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:12,997
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is plenty of time

317
00:38:13,477 --> 00:38:16,698
[SPEAKER_01]: for community comment and participation and engagement.

318
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:35,243
I'm just going to pause quickly.

319
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear the sound?

320
00:38:37,624 --> 00:38:38,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe I'm sharing now.

321
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:39,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

322
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:40,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.

323
00:38:42,344 --> 00:38:50,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford's comprehensive plan is here, and it will act as a roadmap to guide policies and investments over the next 10 to 30 years.

324
00:38:51,946 --> 00:39:02,888
[SPEAKER_12]: It will help the city plan for future development, adapt to climate change, make it easier to move around, support historic and cultural places, align public services with resident needs, and more.

325
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:11,090
[SPEAKER_12]: It sets a clear framework with greater predictability and consistency for residents, businesses, city staff, and developers.

326
00:39:12,257 --> 00:39:15,280
[SPEAKER_12]: The plan is structured around five overarching themes that we heard from you.

327
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:24,928
[SPEAKER_12]: Each chapter of the plan identifies goals, objectives, and actions to support aspirations for the city's future that are easy to measure so that the city can track the plan's progress.

328
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Here are a few examples.

329
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:31,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Identify partners who can help to implement plan recommendations.

330
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:34,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Provide communication training to residents and staff.

331
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:38,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Adopt policies for new development to help with climate mitigation.

332
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:43,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Plant new trees in priority areas with lower income levels or heat islands.

333
00:39:45,638 --> 00:39:49,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Make it easier to walk and bike in Medford by filling gaps in existing networks.

334
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Add solar arrays or other sustainability features to commercial center parking.

335
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:59,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Rezone emerging corridors, such as Mystic Avenue and Mystic Valley Parkway.

336
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:04,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Encourage companies that provide well-paying jobs to residents to locate in Medford.

337
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:11,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Work with partners to maintain and grow a range of housing types, focusing on housing affordability.

338
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:17,536
[SPEAKER_12]: Build and strengthen community connections through neighborhood block parties and citywide celebrations.

339
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:21,098
[SPEAKER_12]: For more examples, take a look at the full plan.

340
00:40:22,398 --> 00:40:24,399
[SPEAKER_12]: The comprehensive plan is a guiding document.

341
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:31,322
[SPEAKER_12]: It will inform future zoning changes and capital projects, but it doesn't directly change any city ordinances or assign funding today.

342
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:38,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Future processes will develop budgets, design capital projects, or revise the city zone.

343
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:50,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Ultimately, the plan serves as a guide to reach a vision for Medford that by 2050, Medford's many welcoming communities thrive among vibrant places that enhance the daily lives of all who work, play, learn, and grow in our city.

344
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:59,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Together, we share a future that is protected from extreme heat and flooding, connects people to where they need to go, and promotes open, engaged communication.

345
00:41:00,426 --> 00:41:03,427
[SPEAKER_12]: The plan is the result of extensive engagement from you, the Medford community.

346
00:41:04,387 --> 00:41:11,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Over the past year and a half, you've been sharing your ideas with us, your concerns, the places that are special to you, and your vision for the future of your community.

347
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:12,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

348
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Your role doesn't end here.

349
00:41:15,231 --> 00:41:17,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Engagement will be ongoing as the plan is implemented.

350
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:26,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Visit www.medfordcompplan.org to read the full plan and to stay informed about upcoming opportunities to shape your community.

351
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:31,451
[SPEAKER_12]: have questions or comments, email compplan at medford-ma.gov.

352
00:41:52,981 --> 00:41:58,986
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we've got a couple edits to make to that, as Annie said, just to make it align with all the revisions.

353
00:41:59,026 --> 00:42:05,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we hope you'll help us share it around and kind of excessively spread the news about the plan.

354
00:42:07,676 --> 00:42:08,296
[SPEAKER_21]: That's wonderful.

355
00:42:08,356 --> 00:42:32,843
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much for the presentation tonight and obviously all of the work you've done it's amazingly impressive to think of the amount of effort that both, or all of the folks involved have put into this the team of consultants advising the city, all the city staff, and maybe most impressive the number of residents who are active participants in this process over a very long period of time.

356
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:40,926
[SPEAKER_21]: And so to me, I think that's worthy of congratulations for everyone who's involved in a very impressive feat.

357
00:42:42,027 --> 00:43:02,315
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought maybe it would be most appropriate for us to invite any of the members of the steering committee, not that they have to speak tonight, but if there's anyone who's motivated to talk about their experience or their feelings, this would be a great opportunity to hear from each and every one of you who'd like to weigh in tonight.

358
00:43:05,895 --> 00:43:08,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Amanda, can you, I'm not sure I'm seeing everyone's hand.

359
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:10,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yes.

360
00:43:10,117 --> 00:43:17,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm happy to have folks, if they, especially from the steering committee, if they want to speak, raise your hand.

361
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Councilor Rick Caraviello.

362
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:22,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to ask you to unmute.

363
00:43:26,224 --> 00:43:30,966
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, thank you, everybody, for all the work we've done over the months of this.

364
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:34,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it was a lot of time put in.

365
00:43:36,563 --> 00:43:37,723
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of work went in.

366
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:42,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a couple of things here.

367
00:43:42,485 --> 00:43:45,306
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no talk about implementation of the plan yet.

368
00:43:46,246 --> 00:43:48,367
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to see how we're gonna implement the plan.

369
00:43:48,867 --> 00:44:04,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think at some point, I've said this from day one, we've gotten a lot of community input, but I think it's time now that we start bringing the stakeholders in the community that own the property and everything

370
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:09,567
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, into the conversation, uh, because again, we know we, everyone can have all the great ideas they want.

371
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:14,989
[SPEAKER_00]: If the stakeholders don't buy into our project, then we've done all this work for naught.

372
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:24,812
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, I would hope, I would hope that, um, we could, uh, invite, invite stakeholders in and, and figure out how to implement the plan that we spent so much time on doing.

373
00:44:25,892 --> 00:44:26,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

374
00:44:28,453 --> 00:44:28,773
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

375
00:44:28,793 --> 00:44:29,734
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for that input.

376
00:44:29,774 --> 00:44:33,255
[SPEAKER_21]: And, um, it is a good reminder as much effort

377
00:44:34,537 --> 00:44:39,538
[SPEAKER_21]: went into getting us to this point, I feel like there's a lot more ahead.

378
00:44:40,038 --> 00:44:53,741
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is only the beginning of the work that's ahead of the boards and residents and city government so thank you for that input do we have others who would like to provide us.

379
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:55,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

380
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:58,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Lincoln from the steering committee.

381
00:44:58,761 --> 00:44:59,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

382
00:44:59,101 --> 00:44:59,962
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Lincoln, how are you.

383
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:05,943
[SPEAKER_13]: No video.

384
00:45:07,744 --> 00:45:08,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

385
00:45:08,485 --> 00:45:12,468
[SPEAKER_02]: We've disabled video for the time being just to dissuade any bad behavior.

386
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:19,814
[SPEAKER_07]: She means from the Zoom bombers.

387
00:45:19,874 --> 00:45:20,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

388
00:45:20,314 --> 00:45:20,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Not from you.

389
00:45:20,955 --> 00:45:22,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Not from anyone.

390
00:45:22,817 --> 00:45:24,178
[SPEAKER_07]: We should have made that clear.

391
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:26,900
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to eject a couple of Zoom bombers.

392
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:27,721
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

393
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:28,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

394
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:29,602
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's still not on here.

395
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:33,445
[SPEAKER_11]: We would have to turn it on for everybody.

396
00:45:33,786 --> 00:45:33,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

397
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,308
[SPEAKER_13]: So what am I going to do?

398
00:45:37,328 --> 00:45:38,589
[SPEAKER_11]: You can talk.

399
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:38,909
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't.

400
00:45:39,129 --> 00:45:39,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I can talk.

401
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,210
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

402
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,011
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

403
00:45:41,891 --> 00:45:42,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

404
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:43,252
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

405
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:43,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Forgive me.

406
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:44,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Tom Lincoln.

407
00:45:44,653 --> 00:45:46,635
[SPEAKER_17]: I usually looking at my ugly mug here.

408
00:45:47,636 --> 00:45:48,616
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is terrific.

409
00:45:49,317 --> 00:45:51,078
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of work went has gone into this.

410
00:45:51,379 --> 00:45:55,942
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the key, of course, is, as everybody said, is the implementation.

411
00:45:56,102 --> 00:46:01,987
[SPEAKER_17]: And I understand there'll be, you know, a number of steps taken along those lines.

412
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:03,108
[SPEAKER_17]: I just had a couple of

413
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,322
[SPEAKER_17]: fairly specific comments.

414
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:09,885
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure that's exactly the right time to do it, but I did do the trouble of making a little bit of a list here.

415
00:46:10,426 --> 00:46:11,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Alicia's used to my list.

416
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:24,837
[SPEAKER_17]: I think for the good of all, so to speak, and the good of the plan, I think it'd be really critical to get a couple of things done in a short period.

417
00:46:25,457 --> 00:46:30,401
[SPEAKER_17]: There are 181 items in the implementation section, which is really staggering.

418
00:46:30,908 --> 00:46:33,148
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're certainly not all on the same level.

419
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:50,951
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think that, and I suggested this to Amanda in an email yesterday or today, you know, maybe picking up, I'm just making up a number here, picking a small number here and doing it because there are a number of things here that really aren't gonna cost any money that would really show some forward progress.

420
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:53,112
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, it's my phone, it only goes off when I'm talking.

421
00:46:56,812 --> 00:46:59,853
[SPEAKER_17]: I also wanted to emphasize that the,

422
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,021
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to throw this phone out the window here.

423
00:47:06,482 --> 00:47:07,882
[SPEAKER_17]: Thousands of spam phone calls.

424
00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:20,987
[SPEAKER_17]: I think another point that I've made before, and I'm not sure it's reflected here, is I think the city and the planners obviously need to be aware of broader trends.

425
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:25,429
[SPEAKER_17]: For example, there's a lot of talk here about retail and increasing retail.

426
00:47:26,735 --> 00:47:35,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm no expert on it, but I'm not sure that bricks and mortar retail is a sector that's going to be prospering in the next 10 years in the American economy.

427
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:44,347
[SPEAKER_17]: I just was talking to somebody today, was commenting on the number of vacant buildings in our little square here in West Medford.

428
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:45,648
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a comment.

429
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:55,775
[SPEAKER_17]: The trees, the tree canopy, the idea of a no net loss tree ordinance, I think that

430
00:47:56,448 --> 00:48:01,230
[SPEAKER_17]: came out very strongly in terms of public engagement and public interest.

431
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:04,031
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it would be really good to move ahead on that.

432
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:13,735
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're kind of falling behind, frankly, on the tree front in Medford, both in terms of the canopy and street trees, et cetera.

433
00:48:16,676 --> 00:48:24,439
[SPEAKER_17]: The last thing I would mention, I think that's critical here as a design review board, this failed politically at least once in my lifetime,

434
00:48:25,498 --> 00:48:26,939
[SPEAKER_17]: in the last 15 years.

435
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:35,721
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think that there's a lot of sentiment in Medford that development is not well controlled and certainly not aesthetically controlled.

436
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:44,804
[SPEAKER_17]: We talk endlessly in Medford about our historic neighborhoods, et cetera, but we're losing an awful lot of historic fabric.

437
00:48:44,944 --> 00:48:50,406
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not saying it's all worth saving, but once it's gone, it's gone forever.

438
00:48:55,346 --> 00:49:01,491
[SPEAKER_17]: The last thing that there is mentioned on page 41 about an implementation committee.

439
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:16,422
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure what this is, but I think if you want, as I assume you do, if you want to ensure long-term engagement of residents, that this may be a vehicle you might want to put into effect soon.

440
00:49:16,702 --> 00:49:22,006
[SPEAKER_17]: But as one person on the steering committee and somebody who has way too many opinions, as everybody knows,

441
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:26,751
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm delighted that this has made this much progress.

442
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:40,978
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very hopeful that it will move forward to benefit both the people of Medford, to benefit our economy, benefit the environment, and make us a stronger and even more wonderful place.

443
00:49:41,158 --> 00:49:41,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks very much.

444
00:49:43,551 --> 00:50:03,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Tom thanks for weighing in and thank you as always for your engagement with the city and how much you care about that for understand that recognize it so Amanda, I see Councilor Bears with a hand up maybe among others but yes, I'm asking to unmute now.

445
00:50:05,441 --> 00:50:10,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, thank you so much, Amanda and I'll be short and sweet because I think what I was going to say has been said but

446
00:50:11,165 --> 00:50:18,631
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one, just thankful to everyone who's participated in the process and the staff and all of the consultants who've helped us come to this point.

447
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:37,184
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we can all agree that having a comprehensive plan is long overdue and bringing together all of the work of so many folks, you know, not just over the past year and a half, but also the past, you know, decade or two where we've had plans that didn't go anywhere, but have now maybe had some new life breathed into them by

448
00:50:38,763 --> 00:50:38,983
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, um.

449
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:41,085
[SPEAKER_18]: Pulling them all together in one place, I think is a good thing.

450
00:50:41,345 --> 00:50:47,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Um but I totally agree that now as as we're looking forward, this plan is designed to help us look forward.

451
00:50:48,169 --> 00:51:00,938
[SPEAKER_18]: And the real question to me is the pace of change, you know, and the pace of action and I think you know, being honest about the level of resources and funding that's going to be necessary to take advantage of the great opportunities that this plan presents.

452
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,559
[SPEAKER_18]: Um it's going to be really

453
00:51:10,339 --> 00:51:11,059
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

454
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:22,202
[SPEAKER_21]: As the bears, Amanda Do we have other participants, other members of the public who would like to weigh in I was going to go to the board I let us go last if that's okay.

455
00:51:24,043 --> 00:51:24,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh sorry.

456
00:51:25,003 --> 00:51:26,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

457
00:51:26,343 --> 00:51:26,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda Thank you.

458
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:30,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to thank everyone for the comments so far, Tom and Councilor para bellow.

459
00:51:32,258 --> 00:51:38,403
[SPEAKER_03]: and Councilor Bears, who have all given, we know have read the plan really closely and given it lots of careful thought.

460
00:51:38,423 --> 00:51:49,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to thank them and for the focus on implementation, which has really, I think, been the focus of the team for the last six months with the guidance of this group and others.

461
00:51:51,353 --> 00:52:01,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope, too, with some of Tom's good ideas around low-hanging fruit and kind of implementing some things early, Alicia's team has done a great job looking at

462
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:10,129
[SPEAKER_03]: what's happening now and kind of what's possible to make happen now and kind of lining up the plan with ongoing initiatives and initiatives that are starting.

463
00:52:10,209 --> 00:52:15,113
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully there'll be able to be some, some of that demonstrated early action, which is a great idea.

464
00:52:16,453 --> 00:52:16,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

465
00:52:18,095 --> 00:52:18,455
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

466
00:52:18,475 --> 00:52:18,775
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

467
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,117
[SPEAKER_21]: I see my neighbor, Rick Orlando with his hand up.

468
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:30,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, neighbor.

469
00:52:32,911 --> 00:52:41,776
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to thank everybody, both those involved from the city and the consultant work and the citizens of the city.

470
00:52:42,296 --> 00:52:47,879
[SPEAKER_19]: I would just like to, we hear discussions or questions on implementation frequently.

471
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:54,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Implementation will touch pretty much all of the elements of the plan, the core areas.

472
00:52:55,624 --> 00:52:57,345
[SPEAKER_19]: I think though, in many cases,

473
00:52:58,025 --> 00:53:02,287
[SPEAKER_19]: the public, particularly the public that may not have been as active or involved in this.

474
00:53:02,727 --> 00:53:15,794
[SPEAKER_19]: When they hear that word, they're thinking about development in terms of economic development, downtown development, amenities, buildings, shovels in the ground, that type of thing.

475
00:53:15,994 --> 00:53:20,837
[SPEAKER_19]: That's done in an intelligent way for the respective areas that development will go on.

476
00:53:21,437 --> 00:53:22,958
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think I just want to

477
00:53:24,347 --> 00:53:30,330
[SPEAKER_19]: distinguish what I think a lot of people are actually inquiring about when they ask about implementation.

478
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:37,793
[SPEAKER_19]: And the last thing I would just echo what Tom said about as we move towards that development, having design guidelines.

479
00:53:37,993 --> 00:53:44,656
[SPEAKER_19]: So we ended up coming up with something that is attractive and acceptable and well-received by the community.

480
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:45,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

481
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:52,099
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much, Rick, for your input and your involvement as always.

482
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:59,892
[SPEAKER_21]: Amanda, can I go to the board now or do we have some other members of the steering committee or public who'd like to weigh in.

483
00:54:01,293 --> 00:54:06,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like nobody else has raised their hand or chatted me so yeah, feel free.

484
00:54:06,735 --> 00:54:08,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice Chair potato.

485
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:09,096
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you this evening.

486
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:10,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

487
00:54:10,857 --> 00:54:11,557
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pretty good.

488
00:54:11,737 --> 00:54:15,319
[SPEAKER_15]: I am I actually did raise my hand as a steering committee member I wanted to.

489
00:54:16,216 --> 00:54:18,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I don't know if I did it properly here.

490
00:54:18,758 --> 00:54:23,583
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to just make a quick comment before I got into the board discussions.

491
00:54:23,663 --> 00:54:35,713
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, just echoing everyone and thanking everyone that took part in this and just first and foremost, congratulations to the city of Medford for getting the ball moving to create and implement this comprehensive plan, right?

492
00:54:36,193 --> 00:54:43,320
[SPEAKER_15]: It expresses the community's values, goals, preferences that align with regulatory requirements as in what we can legally and feasibly be done.

493
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:49,985
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, it's represents a healthy, a stealthy collaboration of various community members.

494
00:54:50,045 --> 00:54:57,450
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just honored for the opportunity to take part in this inception, including the strategies that we will decide on and figure out to move it forward.

495
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:04,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so I just wanted to just put that out there from the steering committee as a resident, and then I'll circle back as a board member.

496
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:09,138
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

497
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:10,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Jackie.

498
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:11,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

499
00:55:15,955 --> 00:55:23,743
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Amanda, should we give it right back to Jackie then she could kick off our board discussion of the comp plan.

500
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:24,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

501
00:55:24,664 --> 00:55:26,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Jackie if you don't mind taking the honors.

502
00:55:27,026 --> 00:55:28,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Now we're in a different hat.

503
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:30,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Now we're in a different hat.

504
00:55:31,943 --> 00:55:38,950
[SPEAKER_15]: a couple of concerns have not so much concerns, but real life action and how we're going to move the action plans forward.

505
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:51,682
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the questions I had was there was a lot of moving pieces in the implementation section of it, and it's just a matter of having more in-depth conversations with the community, with the city staff, and how we're going to

506
00:55:52,662 --> 00:56:02,993
[SPEAKER_15]: get this out to the community and continued engagement of making sure that it's implemented in a way that actually was captured in the spirit in which it was captured.

507
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:13,063
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and that includes the very real and uncomfortable conversations with elected officials on funding and just making it a huge priority.

508
00:56:14,095 --> 00:56:25,080
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's really not a question that I have it's just more of a statement that I want to put out there and, and, and I, I have no doubt that this plan could be done, but we really need to.

509
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:33,784
[SPEAKER_15]: We really did the same energy that was used to make the plan needs to continue and its implementation.

510
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:37,386
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Jackie.

511
00:56:39,327 --> 00:56:43,129
[SPEAKER_21]: Other board members with feelings on the plan before us today.

512
00:56:51,420 --> 00:57:16,095
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess just following up on Jackie's thought is that really the first thing that needs to happen is, what is the identifying the first step is it an implementation committee is for various boards and city departments to each identify what their individual first step is in implementation, I'm not sure what, what the answer is to that.

513
00:57:17,636 --> 00:57:21,720
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, Mr. Chair, I'd love to throw in a couple of thoughts on the implementation.

514
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

515
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you heard for a few people.

516
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:33,850
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the implementation committee, I think, Tom Lincoln mentioned it is certainly part of this, as is incidentally design review board.

517
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:49,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say that's probably one of the first administrative steps to take in terms of organization, is to figure out how that committee should be set up, who should be on it, get them moving so that they can start to get familiar with the plan.

518
00:57:52,237 --> 00:57:58,939
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other comments was, you know, the physical changes that could come out of this, and that's certainly true.

519
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:00,240
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plenty of

520
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:17,170
[SPEAKER_01]: actions in here that would result in some sort of physical change, whether it's planting trees, taking care of open space, looking at development, looking at short-term improvement programs to a particular area versus long-term development.

521
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:25,515
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking about what that low-hanging fruit is is important, but I also want to call out there are things in here that aren't necessarily physical changes.

522
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:46,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's something that people should be aware of too, that some of the recommendations are about that communication, that bringing people together as Jackie mentioned, that idea that there needs to be a continuing process and back and forth between the city, the residents, the property owners, the business owners, all of the people who are involved with the community.

523
00:58:47,074 --> 00:58:48,395
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to call that out.

524
00:58:48,975 --> 00:58:59,799
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, Jackie also mentioned financing and I didn't forget to say that in the implementation section there is a list of financial resources programs that can help the city.

525
00:59:00,959 --> 00:59:11,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Do additional planning work with the state to do some infrastructure improvements so there's a whole list of appropriate funding sources.

526
00:59:11,943 --> 00:59:17,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them are grants that are competitive grants but the advantage of having a comprehensive plan

527
00:59:18,385 --> 00:59:20,967
[SPEAKER_01]: is it makes you more competitive when you go after that.

528
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:31,472
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows the city to put a strong face forward saying we've done our planning, this is how we've engaged the community, this is what the priorities have been, this grant would help us get there.

529
00:59:31,592 --> 00:59:35,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really important component of implementation to understand.

530
00:59:35,955 --> 00:59:41,878
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think from the city's point of view, the entire city, getting that implementation committee up and running

531
00:59:42,698 --> 00:59:54,226
[SPEAKER_01]: from your point of view, the CD board, I think looking at the zoning changes, the links to economic development there, and then understanding the grant cycles and programs and how those would work.

532
00:59:54,306 --> 00:59:57,868
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll stop now, because I see Alicia has her hand up as well.

533
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,871
[SPEAKER_21]: Please, Alicia, we'd love to hear from you.

534
01:00:05,092 --> 01:00:06,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

535
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:09,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this is stuff that we've been thinking about a lot.

536
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:25,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and we've been taking some sort of quiet steps in the background, as some of you are aware, we had, we've had a planner position that's gone on killed for quite a while, that was recently changed to a senior planner position.

537
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,718
[SPEAKER_07]: and Danielle was promoted into that position.

538
01:00:29,438 --> 01:00:38,947
[SPEAKER_07]: And part of what she'll do is take on staffing of this board, but part of what was written into that job description was just to work with implementation of the comprehensive plan.

539
01:00:39,808 --> 01:00:46,114
[SPEAKER_07]: And so some of these steps are things that Danielle will be starting to work with, as I will be as well, and everybody in the office.

540
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:49,097
[SPEAKER_07]: But part of what that makes this possible

541
01:00:49,617 --> 01:00:56,302
[SPEAKER_07]: is that Amanda will then continue to work on a lot of the parks projects that she's been doing and bring more attention to those.

542
01:00:56,783 --> 01:01:05,329
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Danielle was actually filling two roles, and we've posted both of those as full-time positions funded through the CPA and CDBG.

543
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:14,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're back filling Danielle's work if we can find some good candidates with two people, a housing planner and a CPA manager.

544
01:01:15,334 --> 01:01:19,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And that should really free up her ability to spend some time on some of these.

545
01:01:20,016 --> 01:01:21,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, I have to apologize.

546
01:01:21,856 --> 01:01:25,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot remember in which forums I've mentioned this.

547
01:01:25,517 --> 01:01:33,140
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one additional position that we haven't posted yet, but we received a grant from the state for a climate zoning planner.

548
01:01:33,762 --> 01:01:51,276
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we gave them not a description, but a scope of what that person would do, we basically listed all the climate and zoning items that are in the plan, the comprehensive plan and the climate plan.

549
01:01:51,316 --> 01:02:01,965
[SPEAKER_07]: And we said, they're gonna work with the city council and legal and find best practices and help to bring these things forward and help move a bunch of this climate policy forward.

550
01:02:02,997 --> 01:02:05,939
[SPEAKER_07]: much of which is in the comprehensive plan as well.

551
01:02:06,399 --> 01:02:20,105
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's another position that we do expect it'll take us a little bit of time to fill, but that we will also be bringing those resources as well to the table, because a lot of this does take human capital and time.

552
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:24,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of these things are things in the implementation plan

553
01:02:25,402 --> 01:02:38,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Each item, each action is given a project champion, which is a department or department head in the city, who is not necessarily going to personally do it, but would be responsible for moving that forward.

554
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:45,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And in that way we've distributed the work, because this is not one person, it's not one board, it's not even one office.

555
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:53,004
[SPEAKER_07]: There are things in there listed for the city engineer for the traffic department for the DPW for the mayor's office the comms department.

556
01:02:53,424 --> 01:02:55,105
[SPEAKER_07]: There is for the health department.

557
01:02:55,465 --> 01:02:56,845
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot there under us.

558
01:02:57,305 --> 01:03:04,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of this is actually plans like just for developers for them to understand what is the city looking forward for.

559
01:03:05,387 --> 01:03:07,828
[SPEAKER_07]: We were pleased to have one of our big property owners,

560
01:03:08,528 --> 01:03:18,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, uh, from pre auto lane on the, um, advisory board for this as well as well as one at least one small business owner off the top of my head.

561
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:24,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So and we have reached out and talked with various property owners in the city.

562
01:03:25,312 --> 01:03:32,218
[SPEAKER_07]: But part of this is a roadmap for them and developers to understand what is it that the city would like to see moving forward.

563
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of it does set the stage for us to know where do we do need to do a little bit more work.

564
01:03:37,623 --> 01:03:39,145
[SPEAKER_07]: And where do we need to dig deeper.

565
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:42,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do recognize that but we're ready.

566
01:03:43,575 --> 01:03:53,562
[SPEAKER_07]: We're ready and if you can help share our job descriptions out and help us find more qualified candidates to share this load with us, that would actually be amazing.

567
01:03:54,222 --> 01:03:56,164
[SPEAKER_07]: So we thank you all this evening.

568
01:03:56,184 --> 01:03:57,925
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

569
01:03:57,985 --> 01:03:58,385
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

570
01:03:58,785 --> 01:03:59,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

571
01:04:03,616 --> 01:04:10,579
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess one that I feel like is most relevant to us as a board is the set of zoning considerations that are presented.

572
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:32,469
[SPEAKER_21]: And we don't always have time to think about those and we only meet kind of these public forums and we do have provisions that we could meet as a subcommittee or we could set up subcommittees, maybe that's something that we need to think about, so that we can roll up our sleeves a little bit and take a look at some of the zoning recommendations and see how they might apply in the community.

573
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:38,673
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's just a thought that's occurring to me now so we're talking through this.

574
01:04:39,534 --> 01:04:48,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of the zoning in the past has come from city councils and the zoning has come from, you know, Alicia's office because there have been certain developments or issues that have been raised.

575
01:04:49,441 --> 01:04:58,227
[SPEAKER_21]: But I haven't seen that come from the board itself, maybe this is an opportunity for us to be a little more proactive in an area that is central to our core missions.

576
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:04,290
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

577
01:05:05,091 --> 01:05:17,527
[SPEAKER_21]: Any other comments we do have the opportunity tonight to vote to adopt the proposed comprehensive plan that's part of our role if we as a board are ready to do that.

578
01:05:18,929 --> 01:05:22,213
[SPEAKER_21]: If there's not more discussion we could certainly move to that next step of the motion.

579
01:05:23,475 --> 01:05:24,155
[SPEAKER_15]: chair Bloomberg.

580
01:05:24,195 --> 01:05:26,356
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have one more comment I wanted to make.

581
01:05:26,576 --> 01:05:28,577
[SPEAKER_15]: I would be remiss if I didn't say this.

582
01:05:28,617 --> 01:05:31,738
[SPEAKER_15]: We thank everyone, including the city staff and all the residents and everyone.

583
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:37,580
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to just give a special thanks agency for in your partners for all that you did.

584
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:43,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I was also part of the selection process for that and you didn't disappoint.

585
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:45,263
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted, I just, I had to say that.

586
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,916
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

587
01:05:51,796 --> 01:05:54,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I just also want to just be explicitly clear.

588
01:05:55,818 --> 01:06:05,602
[SPEAKER_07]: There are two things that are being edited the acknowledgements page, we're still finalizing we just want to make sure that everybody's listed the way they prefer to be listed on that.

589
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:08,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're finalizing the acknowledgements page.

590
01:06:08,563 --> 01:06:14,826
[SPEAKER_07]: and we asked the mayor's office if they would write an introduction letter from the mayor.

591
01:06:16,266 --> 01:06:26,250
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did tell them that we did not need that for this evening, because they're working, the mayor's giving a big state of the city next week, and I didn't want to try and compete with that.

592
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:31,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather it be them take the time to really give us a good letter.

593
01:06:32,813 --> 01:06:33,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

594
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:43,140
[SPEAKER_07]: My hope is that that wouldn't hold up your need to vote if you were so inclined to vote on it, though.

595
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,080
[SPEAKER_21]: That sounds fair.

596
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:50,924
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyone want to make a motion for approval of the comprehensive plan?

597
01:06:53,245 --> 01:06:54,346
[SPEAKER_21]: Adoption, I think is the right word.

598
01:06:54,826 --> 01:06:57,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Adoption, so moved, unless you would like me to repeat that.

599
01:06:57,367 --> 01:06:59,588
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll second.

600
01:07:00,169 --> 01:07:00,489
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

601
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:08,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Call for a roll call vote then sure I have everyone vice chair, Jackie for title.

602
01:07:08,602 --> 01:07:08,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

603
01:07:10,022 --> 01:07:10,703
[SPEAKER_21]: Deanna Peabody.

604
01:07:11,303 --> 01:07:13,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

605
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:14,584
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

606
01:07:15,304 --> 01:07:15,904
[SPEAKER_21]: Christy doubt.

607
01:07:16,805 --> 01:07:17,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

608
01:07:19,205 --> 01:07:20,246
[SPEAKER_21]: George, George Fisher.

609
01:07:21,146 --> 01:07:21,466
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

610
01:07:22,887 --> 01:07:23,867
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm a yes as well.

611
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:32,850
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks again to everyone who was involved, and thank you for everyone who participated this evening and congratulations to everyone.

612
01:07:38,527 --> 01:07:38,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

613
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:41,929
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate your support on this big effort.

614
01:07:41,969 --> 01:07:42,869
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a big lift.

615
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:44,650
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

616
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:45,451
[SPEAKER_21]: Good work, everyone.

617
01:07:47,692 --> 01:07:50,713
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, Amanda, we're ready to move on to item number two on our agenda.

618
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,114
[SPEAKER_21]: I see you nodding.

619
01:07:52,294 --> 01:07:52,634
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

620
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:54,855
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a presentation tonight.

621
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,702
[SPEAKER_21]: from Verdant Bio in connection with 243 Mystic Ave.

622
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:11,427
[SPEAKER_21]: This is an informal sort of preliminary presentation brought to us by the proponent team.

623
01:08:13,168 --> 01:08:22,593
[SPEAKER_21]: And looking for who's taking the lead on behalf of the Verdant Bio tonight.

624
01:08:24,995 --> 01:08:26,295
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could put it in the chat,

625
01:08:28,267 --> 01:08:33,871
[SPEAKER_02]: who the lead presenter is and I'll unmute you and give you permissions.

626
01:08:40,277 --> 01:08:41,477
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, give me one second.

627
01:08:51,505 --> 01:08:55,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you should be all set to be able to share and unmute as needed.

628
01:08:59,258 --> 01:08:59,959
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, everybody.

629
01:09:00,459 --> 01:09:01,940
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for having us this evening.

630
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:04,282
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Doug Medveds here.

631
01:09:05,483 --> 01:09:07,545
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm one of the principals at Verdant Bio.

632
01:09:08,085 --> 01:09:10,988
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm here with Matt Juros of CI Design.

633
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:14,331
[SPEAKER_20]: They are the lead architects on the project.

634
01:09:14,711 --> 01:09:15,852
[SPEAKER_20]: Khadijah Hindi is here with me.

635
01:09:15,892 --> 01:09:17,353
[SPEAKER_20]: She's another principal at Verdant.

636
01:09:17,914 --> 01:09:24,919
[SPEAKER_20]: Our attorney, James Heffernan, is also on in case there's any questions that we can't answer along those lines.

637
01:09:27,257 --> 01:09:29,699
[SPEAKER_20]: actually glad we were here tonight to hear all this.

638
01:09:29,719 --> 01:09:30,339
[SPEAKER_20]: This was great.

639
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:31,980
[SPEAKER_20]: Very informative for us.

640
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,662
[SPEAKER_20]: I was completely unaware that we were going to get to listen to all that.

641
01:09:34,682 --> 01:09:36,483
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was really fascinating.

642
01:09:36,523 --> 01:09:40,926
[SPEAKER_20]: And hopefully we can we can help out with with some of the implementation.

643
01:09:42,947 --> 01:09:44,749
[SPEAKER_20]: A little bit of background on Verdant.

644
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:58,401
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, if I could just interrupt and I'm sorry because I've given you the floor now I'm taking it back from you but I just wanted to make a note, both for your team, you and your team and also others who might be watching and participating that this is a preliminary

645
01:09:59,081 --> 01:10:02,863
[SPEAKER_21]: presentation and we did a little bit of background for your benefit.

646
01:10:03,443 --> 01:10:13,929
[SPEAKER_21]: We've done this a handful of times now, and we find, I think, as a board that it's very helpful for us and the proponents, I think, get a lot out of it.

647
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:24,855
[SPEAKER_21]: One cautionary note, which maybe goes without saying, but I'll say it because we did at one point have someone do a preliminary presentation with us.

648
01:10:26,019 --> 01:10:49,192
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, we gave a lot of feedback and when they came back they were disappointed that we had more feedback than even we what we presented in our initial meeting so yeah, I just, I just with that understanding that this won't be the comprehensive full to do list of every comment that you're going to receive from the board will certainly do our best to be helpful and give you as much productive feedback as we can this evening, no doubt.

649
01:10:50,222 --> 01:10:55,510
[SPEAKER_20]: Definitely appreciate that and we completely understand where you're coming from, right?

650
01:10:55,550 --> 01:11:01,900
[SPEAKER_20]: We present this, people are going to have comments tonight and then they're going to think about it, maybe look at it another day and then have some other feedback.

651
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:13,548
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we have gone through a pretty lengthy community process in Chelsea already on a similar building, a bigger building, but similar ideas.

652
01:11:13,588 --> 01:11:22,375
[SPEAKER_20]: So there was a lot of back and forth, and we did a lot of free application meetings prior to submitting our zoning application.

653
01:11:22,395 --> 01:11:27,779
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why I was so happy when Amanda suggested this, so that we could have this conversation and get to know each other.

654
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:38,408
[SPEAKER_20]: And so yes, please, we welcome any feedback, any concerns, comments, questions, whatever anybody on the call has, we are open to them.

655
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:42,692
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, a little bit of background on Verdant.

656
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:48,978
[SPEAKER_20]: So Khadijah and myself are the principals, and we've been doing development for about 10 years.

657
01:11:49,778 --> 01:11:50,359
[SPEAKER_20]: We started in

658
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,741
[SPEAKER_20]: the residential world.

659
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:57,644
[SPEAKER_20]: And that came after many years in the lab.

660
01:11:57,684 --> 01:11:59,666
[SPEAKER_20]: So we are both scientists by training.

661
01:12:00,486 --> 01:12:04,369
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we transitioned into development for a variety of reasons.

662
01:12:04,829 --> 01:12:20,941
[SPEAKER_20]: And over the last couple of years, some of our peers and colleagues who are still in the science world started talking to us and saying, it would be really nice if you started dipping in to the life science and biotech development because of our backgrounds and because of our understanding of

663
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:24,883
[SPEAKER_20]: of science and the lab and the functionality of how a lab should be run.

664
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:37,089
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we really approach development of life science from the scientist perspective, as opposed to just coming in and saying, hey, we want to build these massive buildings and put as many square feet as we can.

665
01:12:37,929 --> 01:12:44,593
[SPEAKER_20]: The other benefit to having that sort of direct knowledge and connection to the science world is

666
01:12:45,133 --> 01:12:51,737
[SPEAKER_20]: We are actively talking to companies in the biotech space and asking them, how should these buildings be run?

667
01:12:52,097 --> 01:12:56,520
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we're looking at this building as what we're considering a bio incubator.

668
01:12:58,221 --> 01:13:05,208
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not going to be necessarily one large tenant who takes up the entire building.

669
01:13:05,629 --> 01:13:17,421
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be a mixture of smaller early stage companies who are very well funded, who are going to be taking, if you want to think of it almost as like a condo building, like a

670
01:13:18,262 --> 01:13:24,544
[SPEAKER_20]: companies are gonna take small pieces of the building and do their research that way and grow into larger spaces.

671
01:13:24,604 --> 01:13:28,805
[SPEAKER_20]: We think that that's where the vast majority of these companies are at this point.

672
01:13:29,585 --> 01:13:32,085
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's kind of the focus of this building overall.

673
01:13:33,406 --> 01:13:38,787
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, I always like to let everybody know why we chose this particular location.

674
01:13:39,227 --> 01:13:42,808
[SPEAKER_20]: We look at a lot of, I think Matt's gonna share the screen here.

675
01:13:44,148 --> 01:13:46,269
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'll give him one second to pull that up.

676
01:13:47,688 --> 01:13:52,193
[SPEAKER_20]: We do look at a lot of locations and I spend, can everybody see the...

677
01:13:53,741 --> 01:13:54,841
[SPEAKER_20]: the slideshow here?

678
01:13:55,201 --> 01:13:55,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

679
01:13:56,502 --> 01:14:00,163
[SPEAKER_20]: So I do shop a lot at Wegmans.

680
01:14:00,223 --> 01:14:01,944
[SPEAKER_20]: I do know this area quite well.

681
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:09,586
[SPEAKER_20]: And so when this location came to me through a real estate agent that I know, I was really excited.

682
01:14:10,206 --> 01:14:13,167
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I wanted to share a little bit on why we think that.

683
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:20,490
[SPEAKER_20]: The main issue for us and scientists in perspective or in general is,

684
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:23,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Obviously, locations that are close to transportation, right?

685
01:14:23,772 --> 01:14:29,697
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to be and most scientists would prefer not to drive if possible.

686
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:36,943
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we try to look for locations where obviously we're going to put some parking in the building because that's what a lot of cities require.

687
01:14:36,963 --> 01:14:44,109
[SPEAKER_20]: But we want to find locations that have some walkability or the potential to have some sort of shuttle system.

688
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:51,716
[SPEAKER_20]: So just, I'm sure most of you are familiar with this, but here's the location, 243 Mystic Avenue.

689
01:14:52,476 --> 01:15:01,023
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the architect team put these circles with a radius of about a two minute walk for the first circle and about a 10 minute walk for the second circle.

690
01:15:01,464 --> 01:15:04,747
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything within that circle is obviously very walkable for a scientist.

691
01:15:04,787 --> 01:15:11,092
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we wanted to highlight some of the transportation nodes that are around here as well as the

692
01:15:12,868 --> 01:15:16,310
[SPEAKER_20]: the bus routes and bike stations as well.

693
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:22,295
[SPEAKER_20]: So all of these are really important aspects for an early stage biotech company.

694
01:15:23,335 --> 01:15:26,878
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's one of the really attractive parts of this location.

695
01:15:26,978 --> 01:15:33,282
[SPEAKER_20]: Obviously, we have Wellington Station, we have Wegmans, we have Assembly Row, all very close here.

696
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:36,044
[SPEAKER_20]: There's apartment buildings right across the river.

697
01:15:36,084 --> 01:15:37,285
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's also the,

698
01:15:38,386 --> 01:15:59,782
[SPEAKER_20]: the the sort of young professional style apartments that are close and then obviously just to the to the west of our site we have a lot of residential neighborhoods right so there's everything that we need in this potential site to really build a nice building and bring in the young professionals to who are going to be working as the scientists in this lab so

699
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:08,495
[SPEAKER_20]: The other thing, too, is we do talk, as I mentioned, we talk to scientists and CEOs of these companies and we ask them what they think about these locations.

700
01:16:08,615 --> 01:16:11,599
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we've got a lot of positive feedback around there.

701
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,322
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the last thing is.

702
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:17,602
[SPEAKER_20]: we do see a lot of potential for development in this area.

703
01:16:17,642 --> 01:16:22,746
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that was hit on very well with the comprehensive plan that was just described.

704
01:16:23,867 --> 01:16:35,616
[SPEAKER_20]: There is, besides the fact that we think there's a lot of commercial and industrial sites along sort of Mystic Avenue here that could be primed for redevelopment, you obviously have Tufts, that's not very far away.

705
01:16:36,236 --> 01:16:39,579
[SPEAKER_20]: And that will help drive new companies, right?

706
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:42,761
[SPEAKER_20]: We can collaborate with Tufts in a variety of ways,

707
01:16:44,741 --> 01:16:54,124
[SPEAKER_20]: Universities like Tufts, who are actively producing biotech companies, those are things that are really attractive in building life science buildings.

708
01:16:54,624 --> 01:16:58,086
[SPEAKER_20]: So just a little bit of feel for why we chose this site.

709
01:17:00,066 --> 01:17:03,267
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm actually going to turn it over to Matt at this point.

710
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:04,888
[SPEAKER_20]: Matt Jurows, he's the lead architect.

711
01:17:04,928 --> 01:17:10,510
[SPEAKER_20]: He's going to go through sort of his vision on what makes sense for this building.

712
01:17:11,353 --> 01:17:21,121
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, thanks Doug and thanks for taking some time with us this evening, the opportunity to have sort of a low stakes conversation.

713
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:25,955
[SPEAKER_23]: and sort of get your feedback as we continue developing the buildings.

714
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:31,678
[SPEAKER_23]: Very much, you know, a work in progress at this moment is really valuable.

715
01:17:32,699 --> 01:17:42,946
[SPEAKER_23]: And also, we're really excited to see the master plan come out and then, you know, sort of be here witnessing the moment when it becomes, you know, it's about to become zoning.

716
01:17:43,086 --> 01:17:46,809
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, I've lived in this area for about 30 years and have

717
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:53,160
[SPEAKER_23]: have watched Medford and know so many people who live here.

718
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:58,542
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm so excited for what feels like Medford's moment to really come.

719
01:17:58,742 --> 01:18:02,563
[SPEAKER_23]: And so just that's a side note.

720
01:18:03,223 --> 01:18:07,905
[SPEAKER_23]: So Doug really sort of hit on what's important to us about the site.

721
01:18:09,085 --> 01:18:15,027
[SPEAKER_23]: And what's true also about the site is that it's very small, 82 feet by

722
01:18:17,308 --> 01:18:19,130
[SPEAKER_23]: 90 feet plus or minus.

723
01:18:20,411 --> 01:18:28,700
[SPEAKER_23]: And so it's really it's sort of a very constrained site and the opportunity to work there is something that we have to be sort of inventive.

724
01:18:31,448 --> 01:18:44,140
[SPEAKER_23]: So what we're proposing is that it would be a building that really takes the footprints of the site plan and extrudes it up to buildings that have labs in them.

725
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,303
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is sort of an incubator startup ramp up.

726
01:18:48,083 --> 01:19:06,524
[SPEAKER_23]: type of place and these are so these are wet labs have a tremendous amount of mechanical equipment and we need space for those in addition to the labs themselves parking in vertical circulation chemical storage are all parts of a building like this and so we're sort of creating that building in

727
01:19:09,062 --> 01:19:11,964
[SPEAKER_23]: It's easier in increments of 250,000 square feet.

728
01:19:12,465 --> 01:19:13,306
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's just say that.

729
01:19:13,566 --> 01:19:15,328
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we're doing it in miniature here.

730
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:26,098
[SPEAKER_23]: But I think it's actually appropriate for where this part of the metro Boston is and where life science is at this moment.

731
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:30,483
[SPEAKER_23]: It's really kind of seeding the area with this type of facility.

732
01:19:31,784 --> 01:19:40,492
[SPEAKER_23]: there's a real flywheel that's really healthy in the Boston area and Tufts is a large contributor to that.

733
01:19:41,753 --> 01:19:46,498
[SPEAKER_23]: So to kind of dig into the building a little bit specifically, it's, you know,

734
01:19:47,134 --> 01:20:00,997
[SPEAKER_23]: very early stages and I looked at the presentation this morning after I had been designing to turn it over to the design team and it looks different now than when I last left.

735
01:20:01,037 --> 01:20:06,419
[SPEAKER_23]: It's intended to be a very austere building and sort of sculptural and beautiful.

736
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:11,740
[SPEAKER_23]: Eight stories tall, seven stories of lab space above

737
01:20:12,362 --> 01:20:17,480
[SPEAKER_23]: a ground floor that's got lobbies, utility spaces, storage, and some parking.

738
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:24,909
[SPEAKER_23]: And so in this iteration, we're seeing some more sort of figural work on the facade.

739
01:20:25,009 --> 01:20:42,160
[SPEAKER_23]: And what I think the designer is doing is acknowledging the height of this building and really until it has neighbors that join it of this sort, it's going to have a physical presence.

740
01:20:44,437 --> 01:20:56,272
[SPEAKER_23]: This is, so this is Harvard app here in Medford or mystic app, and that direction so we this is part of the building looks back towards the skyline of Boston it's sort of south and east.

741
01:20:57,863 --> 01:21:05,345
[SPEAKER_23]: really, you know, to get a little bit of altitude as an occupant of the building is actually a real positive and a real opportunity here.

742
01:21:06,005 --> 01:21:12,326
[SPEAKER_23]: So these are some of the issues that we're sort of working through as we put the building into play.

743
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:19,288
[SPEAKER_23]: Looking at the ground floor, we understand that, you know, we're going to have

744
01:21:22,406 --> 01:21:24,968
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a couple of different things that a science building needs to do.

745
01:21:25,049 --> 01:21:28,752
[SPEAKER_23]: One is we need to accommodate our occupants and the people who are going to do the science here.

746
01:21:29,272 --> 01:21:33,156
[SPEAKER_23]: But we also need to accommodate loading of materials.

747
01:21:33,196 --> 01:21:43,025
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a significant amount of different types of chemicals and compounds and things that are used in the science that is done in the types of companies that we expect to attract here.

748
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:54,209
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that the loading dock in the service elevator chemical storage and other types of storage are sort of the lungs of a science building.

749
01:21:54,309 --> 01:22:00,175
[SPEAKER_23]: So we start the design with how we're going to do the loading dock and the trash removal and work from there.

750
01:22:00,495 --> 01:22:00,856
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we

751
01:22:02,257 --> 01:22:17,840
[SPEAKER_23]: we first pass is that we would have an entrance to the inside of the building on the ground floor off Harvard Ave and delivery and trash removal would have direct access to a loading dock and the service elevator right in that area.

752
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,521
[SPEAKER_23]: Cars would turn right through here and we've got a 24-foot wide

753
01:22:26,062 --> 01:22:30,984
[SPEAKER_23]: access area here which could accommodate turning radiuses and so forth and allow cars to pull in and out.

754
01:22:31,424 --> 01:22:38,847
[SPEAKER_23]: And we have nine free car stacking mechanisms in this area.

755
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:43,728
[SPEAKER_23]: So we have a total of 27 cars that would be able to accommodate.

756
01:22:44,129 --> 01:22:46,610
[SPEAKER_23]: As we get deeper into really working with the

757
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:52,611
[SPEAKER_23]: mechanical engineers and structural engineers and understanding exactly how much utility space we're going to need.

758
01:22:53,612 --> 01:23:01,134
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a possibility that we could add parking and when we add a space with our plan, we add three.

759
01:23:01,874 --> 01:23:04,255
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that's our concept from the start.

760
01:23:05,975 --> 01:23:14,242
[SPEAKER_23]: people would come in either from the street through here, or a car can come in from this direction into the entry lobby.

761
01:23:14,942 --> 01:23:18,265
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got space blocked out, again, sort of very cartoony.

762
01:23:18,385 --> 01:23:21,467
[SPEAKER_23]: It might be this big, it might be some mechanical space, and here is two.

763
01:23:22,728 --> 01:23:27,632
[SPEAKER_23]: But you know, so when we say retail, we understand that retail in 2023 in the United States,

764
01:23:31,175 --> 01:23:38,562
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, doesn't exist as bricks and sticks, doesn't exist as products that you walk into a place and leave money and take a product out.

765
01:23:39,623 --> 01:23:43,507
[SPEAKER_23]: It's really, it's probably a hospitality operation of some sort.

766
01:23:43,527 --> 01:23:48,732
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I think the chemistry of coffee is actually very important in life science.

767
01:23:49,152 --> 01:23:54,397
[SPEAKER_23]: And so providing for that is actually something that the tenant partner that we're working with

768
01:23:56,398 --> 01:24:00,820
[SPEAKER_23]: insists on and feels that's an important part of the program.

769
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:03,842
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's there.

770
01:24:04,822 --> 01:24:10,384
[SPEAKER_23]: The occupants would take their cup of coffee and go up the elevator and up to the top.

771
01:24:12,182 --> 01:24:13,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry?

772
01:24:14,423 --> 01:24:15,103
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's right.

773
01:24:15,143 --> 01:24:27,066
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so obviously, we want to make this as vibrant and viable an operation as possible so that that hospitality tenant is definitely open to the public.

774
01:24:27,106 --> 01:24:30,647
[SPEAKER_23]: We want to be able to invite people to join us in here.

775
01:24:31,468 --> 01:24:39,630
[SPEAKER_23]: The designers imagined that maybe there would be a food truck or something along those lines that we could line up if we have the sidewalk space on Harvard Avenue.

776
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:44,753
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, kind of picking ideas around and seeing what sticks is really what we're doing at this point.

777
01:24:44,853 --> 01:24:51,737
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, at press time here, this is just a snapshot of where we are at this moment.

778
01:24:51,997 --> 01:25:01,343
[SPEAKER_23]: And the pieces, I think, are the pieces that we want to have to work with where they show up and how they interact is still a work in process.

779
01:25:02,043 --> 01:25:02,463
[SPEAKER_23]: progress.

780
01:25:03,263 --> 01:25:06,744
[SPEAKER_23]: Another option that we're not going to dig too deeply into.

781
01:25:07,285 --> 01:25:13,066
[SPEAKER_23]: And a typical science floor, and each of the floors above the ground floor, are going to follow this this pattern.

782
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:25,230
[SPEAKER_23]: And we'll just take the path of an occupant, a scientist coming to work in the morning, coming up the elevator or getting their steps in the stairs, which is what I would do if I need them.

783
01:25:26,551 --> 01:25:36,557
[SPEAKER_23]: And so there's labs and science buildings like this have two types of space where the work is done.

784
01:25:38,799 --> 01:25:47,684
[SPEAKER_23]: We think of people standing in white coats at a lab bench with beakers and vent hoods and so forth, and that's an important part of how this type of work is done.

785
01:25:48,565 --> 01:25:49,165
[SPEAKER_23]: But also,

786
01:25:50,286 --> 01:25:55,889
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, another important inseparable part of the work is done at desks and on computers.

787
01:25:55,909 --> 01:26:07,073
[SPEAKER_23]: And so what people do is sort of doing research, setting up experiments, reporting and correlating and sort of finalizing results and so forth.

788
01:26:07,113 --> 01:26:08,874
[SPEAKER_23]: This is all basically an office space.

789
01:26:09,394 --> 01:26:13,636
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, the big headlines are about lab benches and

790
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:18,732
[SPEAKER_23]: invent hoods, and water treatment, and so forth.

791
01:26:18,772 --> 01:26:20,072
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's inescapable.

792
01:26:20,112 --> 01:26:23,594
[SPEAKER_23]: But really, 40% of the leasable space is going to be office.

793
01:26:24,374 --> 01:26:25,515
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a simple layout.

794
01:26:25,535 --> 01:26:30,537
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got a set of desks as a demonstration laid out here.

795
01:26:31,058 --> 01:26:40,602
[SPEAKER_23]: And that migrates past the conference room that would be open to the tenants, phone booths here, into open workspace that are less formal than sitting at a desk

796
01:26:42,623 --> 01:26:54,220
[SPEAKER_23]: doing your work there, so maybe it's community tables, maybe there's a kitchen set up, and then you know typical facilities, as scientists tend to be humans, and we need to do

797
01:26:57,848 --> 01:27:08,679
[SPEAKER_23]: So we walk in and we go and walk, we'll likely have a glass barrier between the office space and the science area.

798
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:14,966
[SPEAKER_23]: As you saw from the exterior, we intend to start our design life here with a

799
01:27:16,688 --> 01:27:23,155
[SPEAKER_23]: exterior on Mystic Ave and Harvard Ave, Harvard Street, of primarily glass.

800
01:27:23,215 --> 01:27:29,401
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we're looking at that glass curtain wall for starters, and really that's about sunlight and it's about people.

801
01:27:29,461 --> 01:27:34,506
[SPEAKER_23]: It's about, you know, the impact of the building visually on the neighborhood, and so it's sort of a

802
01:27:35,267 --> 01:27:37,168
[SPEAKER_23]: the first pass that we're taking.

803
01:27:37,188 --> 01:27:51,393
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we're imagining that there would be a tremendous amount of sunlight coming in through here, especially in the morning hours, and that we would want to put glass walls between the office area and the science area in order to share some of that sunlight.

804
01:27:53,428 --> 01:28:01,013
[SPEAKER_23]: We have, I think, five or six foot lab benches set up here.

805
01:28:01,954 --> 01:28:14,983
[SPEAKER_23]: The leasing concept that Sunlit is thinking about is that these would be available, a six foot lab bench at a time or a group of them, or you could take one whole section.

806
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:35,230
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's a very flexible type of arrangement that allows for incubators type companies, real early stage startups, people who are working through seed money and coming up with their initial, testing their initial science for their ideas.

807
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:37,971
[SPEAKER_23]: And through ramp up and 1,000, 2,000 square foot spaces

808
01:28:41,492 --> 01:28:44,755
[SPEAKER_23]: maybe a little bit more than that as the maximum tenant increment.

809
01:28:45,796 --> 01:28:50,280
[SPEAKER_23]: So lab, the work is done on these lab benches, there's benches associated with them.

810
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:55,845
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there's a series of ancillary spaces that support each lab space that

811
01:28:56,983 --> 01:28:58,185
[SPEAKER_23]: lab support, oddly enough.

812
01:28:58,585 --> 01:29:11,041
[SPEAKER_23]: And in lab support rooms, there are a series of different instruments that would be shared by the different companies and scientists that are working in the formal lab area.

813
01:29:11,522 --> 01:29:12,483
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's

814
01:29:13,904 --> 01:29:19,108
[SPEAKER_23]: very sophisticated and expensive equipment that companies at this stage simply aren't going to buy.

815
01:29:19,168 --> 01:29:28,995
[SPEAKER_23]: So a facility like this makes them available as a way to monetize their use and to organize, you know, who signs them out, who gets to use them and when and so forth.

816
01:29:29,335 --> 01:29:29,495
[SPEAKER_23]: So

817
01:29:32,137 --> 01:29:40,383
[SPEAKER_23]: microscopy, autoclave, also there's a whole series of different types of pieces of equipment that we use.

818
01:29:40,663 --> 01:29:46,167
[SPEAKER_23]: There's refrigeration, and that's all going on in the ancillary support rooms.

819
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:47,107
[SPEAKER_23]: There's also a

820
01:29:49,743 --> 01:29:59,349
[SPEAKER_23]: group of chemicals and reagents and things that most of this type of science uses as the basis of the work that they're doing.

821
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:06,835
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we also store some of that material here, most of it on the ground floor level.

822
01:30:06,855 --> 01:30:13,859
[SPEAKER_23]: And then as it's needed upstairs in increments of use, probably on a daily or weekly basis, it migrates upstairs.

823
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,621
[SPEAKER_23]: The building code requires that we

824
01:30:18,502 --> 01:30:22,986
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, it limits the amount of certain chemicals that we can store above the ground floor level.

825
01:30:23,026 --> 01:30:30,131
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's sort of a carefully orchestrated dance of how much and what and where those chemicals are stored.

826
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:33,133
[SPEAKER_23]: But there's also a way to distribute this in

827
01:30:35,417 --> 01:30:42,101
[SPEAKER_23]: provide it for scientists, you know, a beaker at a time or a quart at a time.

828
01:30:42,121 --> 01:30:48,565
[SPEAKER_23]: And so the operation of the facility will organize that and monetize that as well.

829
01:30:49,577 --> 01:30:53,700
[SPEAKER_23]: And then the balance of the space is a stairway.

830
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:58,803
[SPEAKER_23]: We're gonna have a significant amount of vertical circulation, or sorry, vertical shaft space here.

831
01:30:58,824 --> 01:31:01,265
[SPEAKER_23]: And then this is service elevator.

832
01:31:01,285 --> 01:31:14,314
[SPEAKER_23]: So we really have sort of a service core back in this area where materials and chemicals are brought up from below and directly into the support rooms and then out into the labs.

833
01:31:17,065 --> 01:31:17,926
[SPEAKER_23]: continue on here.

834
01:31:17,946 --> 01:31:30,356
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that really sort of takes you through the basics of the type of building that we're talking about, what the pieces are, and how we're arranging them in our first passes.

835
01:31:31,557 --> 01:31:41,005
[SPEAKER_23]: We've taken a good look at sort of in preparation for more substantial conversations about what existing zoning is and where we are with our proposal.

836
01:31:41,025 --> 01:31:43,567
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we're here to sort of talk that through as well.

837
01:31:45,668 --> 01:32:04,582
[SPEAKER_23]: And this talks about the fact that what you'll see often in, say, an office building or other types of commercial space use is the full occupancy of the space with a single use at the times when the building's being used.

838
01:32:05,243 --> 01:32:13,689
[SPEAKER_23]: Science buildings have non-simultaneous occupancy, meaning a scientist who's working at this lab bench here will

839
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:22,446
[SPEAKER_23]: occupy that room for part of the day and then they'll go into their desk for another part of the day, leaving that lab bench and that lab area vacant.

840
01:32:22,807 --> 01:32:26,530
[SPEAKER_23]: So when the actual populations of these

841
01:32:28,648 --> 01:32:34,950
[SPEAKER_23]: and so forth is, you know, the code doesn't really reflect non-simultaneous use.

842
01:32:36,171 --> 01:32:43,053
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, we have to design as though the whole place was having a party, so when we design the size of the exit stairs and so forth.

843
01:32:43,593 --> 01:32:55,537
[SPEAKER_23]: But the reality of who's going to be using this is it's really half the space gets used at a time, which allows us to be confident about the amount of parking that we're putting in here.

844
01:32:55,557 --> 01:32:56,838
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, that

845
01:32:57,878 --> 01:33:02,667
[SPEAKER_23]: particular aspect non-simultaneous use in lab buildings and the proximity to

846
01:33:04,105 --> 01:33:09,169
[SPEAKER_23]: multiple types of public transportation kind of factor into that equation.

847
01:33:09,769 --> 01:33:11,891
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you want to talk through some of the ideas?

848
01:33:11,931 --> 01:33:12,911
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, yeah.

849
01:33:13,052 --> 01:33:30,464
[SPEAKER_20]: Just real quickly, I wanted to mention here that we do, and I mentioned this a little bit at the beginning, but we do, because Khadijah and I come from a science background, we do want to promote what's called STEAM now, but the science, technology, engineering, arts, and math students, whether they're at the universities, whether at the high school,

850
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:43,632
[SPEAKER_20]: We did develop a program in Chelsea with the building that we got approved to have a direct relationship with the high school, where the students were able to be exposed to science at an early age, or much earlier than normal.

851
01:33:44,252 --> 01:33:47,174
[SPEAKER_20]: I wasn't exposed to the sciences until I was an undergrad.

852
01:33:47,654 --> 01:33:52,737
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we are very big proponents of that, but also the non-STEAM students.

853
01:33:54,758 --> 01:34:04,667
[SPEAKER_20]: We have been working with DPR construction, and a lot of the construction companies offer this, but they all they offer internships throughout the construction of the building.

854
01:34:05,128 --> 01:34:09,672
[SPEAKER_20]: So if there are students who are interested in anything non science related so engineering.

855
01:34:10,292 --> 01:34:11,453
[SPEAKER_20]: construction for that matter.

856
01:34:12,174 --> 01:34:18,379
[SPEAKER_20]: They will offer them an internship, they give them computers, they bring them in throughout the entire process.

857
01:34:18,679 --> 01:34:23,844
[SPEAKER_20]: So students can really learn what types of jobs are out there and get some hands-on learning.

858
01:34:23,884 --> 01:34:27,847
[SPEAKER_20]: So we do want to make it clear that those are important to us.

859
01:34:28,347 --> 01:34:29,567
[SPEAKER_20]: as we're building these buildings.

860
01:34:30,088 --> 01:34:35,969
[SPEAKER_20]: And we've already mentioned that there's some publicly accessible space on the first floor of this building.

861
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:41,271
[SPEAKER_20]: That's something we think is obviously important for any building that goes into any city.

862
01:34:41,771 --> 01:34:47,893
[SPEAKER_20]: And so just wanted to briefly touch on some of that and happy to answer any specifics if you have questions on that.

863
01:34:50,098 --> 01:34:51,859
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, yeah, I think that I think we'll leave it there.

864
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:57,761
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't, you know, we wanted to give you a good idea of what we're thinking about here, but we wanted to get a lot.

865
01:34:57,841 --> 01:34:59,601
[SPEAKER_20]: We wanted to get more feedback than anything.

866
01:34:59,641 --> 01:35:06,344
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, you know, whatever questions, comments, concerns, we're happy to hear them now.

867
01:35:06,364 --> 01:35:07,584
[SPEAKER_20]: We're happy to make changes.

868
01:35:07,624 --> 01:35:09,745
[SPEAKER_20]: We're happy to answer anything we can at this moment to.

869
01:35:12,042 --> 01:35:18,766
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, thank you for the, for the presentation and all the information that you've shared with us and your vision for the site.

870
01:35:20,207 --> 01:35:27,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I open this up to one of my colleagues on the board for maybe start with some questions that you may have.

871
01:35:28,883 --> 01:35:31,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Kim and Bloomberg, this is Jackie.

872
01:35:33,164 --> 01:35:35,125
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have some clarifying questions.

873
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:49,950
[SPEAKER_15]: First and foremost, like with any kind of new development in a community, especially by something as great as life sciences, it's really awesome for economic development opportunities, right?

874
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:57,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it would be really, and I guess in our interest to try to figure out how we can help the proponents to move forward.

875
01:35:57,712 --> 01:35:59,414
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some questions that I have.

876
01:35:59,714 --> 01:36:19,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Um overall lab and science is not my forte and one of the things that I'm having a hard that I guess I would be having a hard time is even given preliminary information on like building materials or um, like What we'll be doing blanket conditions and contingencies if if these

877
01:36:21,252 --> 01:36:29,335
[SPEAKER_15]: If these tenants are all different, and would the space be retrofitted to each chemical that they're bringing?

878
01:36:29,675 --> 01:36:34,997
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know that without the building department's comments, without the health department, the fire chief's comments.

879
01:36:35,477 --> 01:36:41,079
[SPEAKER_15]: So as far as what we would be doing for the overall material in the building itself, that escapes me.

880
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:49,662
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, I can stick definitely to give some feedback on parking and other outside factors, but the material overall.

881
01:36:52,808 --> 01:36:56,372
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just not up on without the city's feedback.

882
01:36:57,153 --> 01:37:09,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe you can just sort of piggyback on Jackie's question, because it was part of mine as well as like is there one tenant that's managing the building so they're sort of taking the overall lab.

883
01:37:09,505 --> 01:37:14,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah, that's maybe that's a way to enter Jackie's answer.

884
01:37:15,351 --> 01:37:16,792
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure, that's not it's a great question.

885
01:37:16,812 --> 01:37:20,476
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yes, we, we have a tenant for the building already.

886
01:37:21,637 --> 01:37:23,739
[SPEAKER_20]: They are a bio incubator.

887
01:37:23,779 --> 01:37:28,723
[SPEAKER_20]: So there will be 1 overarching company that manages all the individual companies.

888
01:37:29,324 --> 01:37:29,664
[SPEAKER_20]: So, so.

889
01:37:30,525 --> 01:37:36,153
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not that they are a bio incubator, but I like to call them sort of we work for science.

890
01:37:36,213 --> 01:37:36,393
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that?

891
01:37:36,493 --> 01:37:36,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

892
01:37:36,994 --> 01:37:46,666
[SPEAKER_23]: So we would lease it to one company who would then sublease to smaller companies, a lab venture or 10 or three at a time.

893
01:37:48,167 --> 01:37:51,608
[SPEAKER_20]: And they have a plan already.

894
01:37:51,628 --> 01:37:55,249
[SPEAKER_20]: The reason we chose this group is they also have a science background.

895
01:37:55,449 --> 01:38:00,871
[SPEAKER_20]: And so they've already thought about a lot of the issues that are being brought up with questions, right?

896
01:38:00,971 --> 01:38:03,771
[SPEAKER_20]: Managing the chemicals coming in and out, where do they need to go?

897
01:38:03,871 --> 01:38:04,852
[SPEAKER_20]: How are they controlled?

898
01:38:06,392 --> 01:38:21,378
[SPEAKER_20]: Part of Matt's team too, we have code consultants, we have fire consultants, we have people telling us sort of how we need to do these things so that when we bring it to a city like Medford, we're not, you know, hoping that the fire department or the health department's gonna tell us what to do.

899
01:38:21,598 --> 01:38:25,580
[SPEAKER_20]: We try to come as prepared as possible so that a lot of those questions can be answered.

900
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:33,483
[SPEAKER_20]: But yes, there will be a very qualified company managing everything going on in this building, all the way down to, you know,

901
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,461
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, some of the transportation issues, right?

902
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:43,902
[SPEAKER_20]: We're thinking about partnerships with not only a shuttle system, but car services to help get people in and out of different areas.

903
01:38:44,302 --> 01:38:46,843
[SPEAKER_20]: If they want to travel to Cambridge, right, that comes up a lot.

904
01:38:46,883 --> 01:38:47,923
[SPEAKER_20]: How do we get to Cambridge?

905
01:38:48,223 --> 01:38:56,205
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're thinking about all of those things and this company Skylet, which we're happy to share information if need be about them.

906
01:38:56,285 --> 01:38:59,526
[SPEAKER_20]: They've already, yeah, they're the overarching tenant.

907
01:38:59,546 --> 01:39:00,566
[SPEAKER_20]: We've already signed a lease.

908
01:39:00,586 --> 01:39:01,626
[SPEAKER_20]: They love this location.

909
01:39:01,666 --> 01:39:03,747
[SPEAKER_20]: They're actually helping us design the building as well.

910
01:39:05,429 --> 01:39:06,772
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's all available.

911
01:39:07,553 --> 01:39:15,228
[SPEAKER_05]: To add to what Doug said and to answer one of your questions, Jack.

912
01:39:16,102 --> 01:39:30,216
[SPEAKER_05]: the place, the building itself, the lab space, it's not going to be retrofitted to each individual company because all companies in this stage all have very similar needs.

913
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:40,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And so all of the lab support that is going to be used to support every single one of these companies is going to be retrofitted

914
01:39:41,778 --> 01:39:44,639
[SPEAKER_05]: generally exactly what these companies need.

915
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:56,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as like hood space and filtration systems and water treatments, all of that is going to be applicable to every single one of these companies at this stage.

916
01:39:56,462 --> 01:40:01,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not going to be retrofitted to each company specifically because they all need the same things.

917
01:40:02,583 --> 01:40:09,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as like chemicals, we have consultants who know the code and

918
01:40:12,243 --> 01:40:37,663
[SPEAKER_05]: the storage of the chemicals and they're very, you know, the basic scientists are all using the same, very similar chemicals and very specific aliquots will be used to go up to the higher floors and not in high quantities that would cause any issues in the building.

919
01:40:38,283 --> 01:40:40,765
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have consultants who know the code and who

920
01:40:42,749 --> 01:40:43,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true, we do.

921
01:40:44,871 --> 01:40:52,696
[SPEAKER_23]: And one of the things, too, to keep in mind is we call them companies, but it's really a few friends from graduate school and an idea.

922
01:40:53,737 --> 01:40:55,898
[SPEAKER_23]: And they come and go.

923
01:40:56,279 --> 01:41:00,362
[SPEAKER_23]: They come and grow and move on or take more space.

924
01:41:00,402 --> 01:41:04,104
[SPEAKER_23]: But there's a bit of a churn with companies at this stage.

925
01:41:07,781 --> 01:41:15,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Which they're pretty much looking for support as they test their ideas and maybe even get like venture capital kind of thing.

926
01:41:15,411 --> 01:41:16,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

927
01:41:16,152 --> 01:41:16,993
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

928
01:41:17,053 --> 01:41:18,434
[SPEAKER_20]: So the idea here is.

929
01:41:20,207 --> 01:41:26,210
[SPEAKER_20]: Over the years, we've sort of gained a lot of knowledge and perspective on how these companies succeed, right?

930
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:28,370
[SPEAKER_20]: Some science is going to fail regardless.

931
01:41:28,891 --> 01:41:35,413
[SPEAKER_20]: And so the idea is to create a roadmap for these companies to succeed and allow them to come into these spaces and really do what they do best.

932
01:41:35,453 --> 01:41:36,114
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's science.

933
01:41:36,174 --> 01:41:41,656
[SPEAKER_20]: And we take care of all the other sort of issues that companies don't even think about when they're starting.

934
01:41:42,546 --> 01:41:49,588
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, it's really a, we call it incubator, but it's almost like a, you know, creating a roadmap for success.

935
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:54,970
[SPEAKER_20]: And part of that is when to raise money, how to raise money, teaching them how to communicate, things like that.

936
01:41:55,030 --> 01:42:00,652
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so it's gonna be a very sort of hands-on, full-service type of science building.

937
01:42:00,892 --> 01:42:11,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully as they grow and raise more money, they stick around and stay in the community and offer more jobs and participate in the community development as well.

938
01:42:14,456 --> 01:42:14,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

939
01:42:15,957 --> 01:42:16,157
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

940
01:42:16,437 --> 01:42:32,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you also were you raising a question on parking, just, I didn't want to know, I was, I was sort of reiterating that I mean I can speak on parking at this early stage of the game but I was, you know, I wouldn't be able to speak on other things without the city's input.

941
01:42:32,866 --> 01:42:33,967
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, got you.

942
01:42:34,587 --> 01:42:37,629
[SPEAKER_21]: A class I see your hand up, would you like to go next.

943
01:42:38,689 --> 01:42:38,889
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

944
01:42:41,370 --> 01:42:43,111
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for presenting tonight.

945
01:42:43,812 --> 01:42:48,015
[SPEAKER_22]: I have actually turning out to be a good list of questions here.

946
01:42:48,996 --> 01:43:01,686
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess the first one that I'm, and I'm not expecting that you would answer all these tonight but maybe this is something that you could either furnish to us for the next meeting or at the next meeting.

947
01:43:03,547 --> 01:43:07,230
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we just need to have a really good understanding of what variances you're seeking here.

948
01:43:10,576 --> 01:43:13,698
[SPEAKER_22]: you know, what does this building look like by right?

949
01:43:13,738 --> 01:43:14,679
[SPEAKER_22]: And what does it look like?

950
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:19,723
[SPEAKER_22]: And what's the difference that you guys are suggesting?

951
01:43:21,324 --> 01:43:33,432
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm guessing it's seven or eight stories tall, plus the penthouse in a life science building that's gonna be in the order of 150 feet.

952
01:43:33,492 --> 01:43:36,655
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to say that so everybody on the board can hear that.

953
01:43:37,715 --> 01:43:39,637
[SPEAKER_22]: And that sort of brings me to my next question.

954
01:43:40,815 --> 01:43:44,157
[SPEAKER_22]: My whole, I guess, section of questions here.

955
01:43:45,578 --> 01:44:02,750
[SPEAKER_22]: Really would like to see shadow studies, really would like to see views of the building from the surrounding neighborhood, because just building is going to be way out of scale with anything around it so it's, I think for it to have any hope of gathering.

956
01:44:06,378 --> 01:44:20,570
[SPEAKER_22]: positive reviews, we're going to need to understand how it sits on the site and how it's playing nice with its neighbors because everything here is pretty much a story or two to three story would frame home in the neighborhood to the west.

957
01:44:23,333 --> 01:44:26,395
[SPEAKER_22]: This is sort of in that category as well you're suggesting.

958
01:44:27,665 --> 01:44:33,227
[SPEAKER_22]: basically blank facades on the west and north side, which is troubling to me.

959
01:44:33,287 --> 01:44:44,852
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you talked about some sculptural panels and maybe some lighting, but that sort of another step in the wrong direction possibly because it's really not

960
01:44:48,017 --> 01:44:49,298
[SPEAKER_22]: playing nice with the neighbors.

961
01:44:49,358 --> 01:44:57,344
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if there's an anticipation of a zero outlawing condition, but I just think we need to understand that a little better.

962
01:44:57,364 --> 01:45:00,887
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think you need to address those blank facades because they're a little troubling.

963
01:45:01,608 --> 01:45:08,053
[SPEAKER_23]: Can we jump in or do you want to go through this stuff and we'll talk about it?

964
01:45:10,295 --> 01:45:12,596
[SPEAKER_22]: Why don't you let me finish my list?

965
01:45:12,797 --> 01:45:13,737
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope you're writing this down.

966
01:45:15,138 --> 01:45:15,359
[SPEAKER_22]: We are.

967
01:45:17,987 --> 01:45:22,369
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the design of the building seems okay to me.

968
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:35,874
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not feeling completely contextual, although the evolving feel of Mystic Ave, who knows?

969
01:45:36,694 --> 01:45:46,558
[SPEAKER_22]: But the one thing I did find a little bit curious was the fact that you have this sort of glass building and then on the Harvard Street facade,

970
01:45:47,642 --> 01:45:51,645
[SPEAKER_22]: And even on the Mystic Ave side, you basically have solid walls.

971
01:45:51,665 --> 01:45:55,488
[SPEAKER_22]: You have a couple of punched openings on Mystic Ave.

972
01:45:55,548 --> 01:46:06,676
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm wondering why the glass doesn't just come down to the ground and why we have a blank facade on the Mystic side next to the garage entry.

973
01:46:07,277 --> 01:46:15,123
[SPEAKER_22]: It feels like you took the auto body shop that burned down and you just put this glass building on top of it.

974
01:46:16,703 --> 01:46:22,186
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I, I think the, I think the parking strategy seems good to me.

975
01:46:22,486 --> 01:46:26,648
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you know, I think most people on this board are for less parking.

976
01:46:27,088 --> 01:46:38,533
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, that said, um, be careful because there's nowhere else to park in this area.

977
01:46:38,553 --> 01:46:42,755
[SPEAKER_22]: So, so, um, you're going to get a lot of neighbors, um,

978
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:46,141
[SPEAKER_22]: asking what you're doing about parking.

979
01:46:49,821 --> 01:46:51,922
[SPEAKER_22]: What else?

980
01:46:56,462 --> 01:47:07,004
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the shadow studies are gonna be really important because at 10 in the morning, there's gonna be a lot of shadows on that residential neighborhood.

981
01:47:11,589 --> 01:47:29,133
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, just make sure we include views from the ground, looking down Harvard Ave, looking down Mystic Ave of what this building will look like on its site, because I think that's, again, important in telling the story of how it plays nice with its neighbors and its neighborhood.

982
01:47:30,953 --> 01:47:31,593
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it for me.

983
01:47:32,733 --> 01:47:34,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate that.

984
01:47:34,454 --> 01:47:40,955
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, one last thing, I understand

985
01:47:44,546 --> 01:47:50,631
[SPEAKER_11]: The layout of the ground floor seems a little curious.

986
01:47:50,671 --> 01:47:51,531
[SPEAKER_22]: I know there's two schemes.

987
01:47:52,232 --> 01:47:57,236
[SPEAKER_22]: It seems a little curious to put the conference room on the corner.

988
01:48:01,259 --> 01:48:10,726
[SPEAKER_22]: Ideally, even if it's sort of a little whatever retail, to me that feels like that should be on the corner.

989
01:48:13,310 --> 01:48:27,773
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you have a pinch point with the elevator and stair up there that makes putting the lobby back there probably difficult, but I don't know.

990
01:48:29,113 --> 01:48:43,036
[SPEAKER_22]: That main corner, I suppose the scheme that has the entry on the corner feels okay, but for me it really feels like it should be retail and then the office entry should be along.

991
01:48:43,473 --> 01:48:45,194
[SPEAKER_22]: Mystic Ave side.

992
01:48:47,936 --> 01:49:04,285
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I think, oh, and then my final point, I understand that you have the entry to the garage off of Harvard, but I don't know if you've been in that area around 5 p.m.

993
01:49:04,385 --> 01:49:09,428
[SPEAKER_22]: or on any weekend or at any time when there's increased traffic, but there is,

994
01:49:10,564 --> 01:49:12,787
[SPEAKER_22]: a line from this light back to the next.

995
01:49:13,968 --> 01:49:22,197
[SPEAKER_22]: So often it's going to be, it's going to be a very tricky spot to be, um, to be back in trucks in real.

996
01:49:22,217 --> 01:49:24,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's a really good point.

997
01:49:26,382 --> 01:49:28,665
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I do have more things.

998
01:49:28,685 --> 01:49:28,725
[SPEAKER_22]: Um,

999
01:49:30,333 --> 01:49:42,463
[SPEAKER_22]: Along with the things that I'd love to see is, it looks like there's sort of that traditional big mystic swath of asphalt between the street and the building face.

1000
01:49:45,405 --> 01:49:49,788
[SPEAKER_22]: I would love to see a landscaping plan and how you're gonna address that.

1001
01:49:50,829 --> 01:49:51,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, absolutely.

1002
01:49:52,751 --> 01:49:53,111
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1003
01:49:53,871 --> 01:49:54,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thank you.

1004
01:49:54,552 --> 01:49:55,052
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, thank you.

1005
01:49:55,092 --> 01:49:56,053
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks for a close look.

1006
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:01,081
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Clayce.

1007
01:50:01,121 --> 01:50:02,441
[SPEAKER_21]: Christy, I see your hand is up.

1008
01:50:03,462 --> 01:50:04,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, hi.

1009
01:50:04,082 --> 01:50:05,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Clayce always does a great job.

1010
01:50:06,263 --> 01:50:06,684
[SPEAKER_21]: He does.

1011
01:50:07,984 --> 01:50:08,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Going through the details.

1012
01:50:08,845 --> 01:50:12,247
[SPEAKER_08]: So I love when he goes first because he takes care of most of our lists.

1013
01:50:12,707 --> 01:50:20,611
[SPEAKER_08]: But I concur with all of Clayce's comments and suggestions for more information next time you come and see us.

1014
01:50:21,392 --> 01:50:25,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to say I'm really excited that this type of project is being proposed.

1015
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:35,763
[SPEAKER_08]: for Mystic Ave and I have followed your project in Chelsea and those plans are very, very nice.

1016
01:50:35,803 --> 01:50:41,686
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am hopeful and positive of the type of building design that you can bring here as well.

1017
01:50:41,706 --> 01:50:47,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just keep it brief in terms of where I'm particularly focused.

1018
01:50:47,989 --> 01:50:50,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I share concerns with those blank walls.

1019
01:50:52,180 --> 01:51:13,551
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems more inward facing to me and when you're looking at this being almost like the first really major development of this type in this area and what could come in the future, I think you need to think about it in that context and being more open and inviting to its surroundings.

1020
01:51:14,371 --> 01:51:17,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I am interested in the pedestrian level perspective.

1021
01:51:17,852 --> 01:51:20,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to really see what that looks like at that level.

1022
01:51:20,575 --> 01:51:27,204
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you think about additional views and then also landscape and hardscape plan would be good.

1023
01:51:29,375 --> 01:51:44,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I think activating that street level so it does have retail or more of a community access space is important rather than a conference room that may not always get used and tend to be empty.

1024
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:52,443
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are trying to program it as community space that it's not really activated, it would just be unfortunate to have a space that is empty.

1025
01:51:52,463 --> 01:51:55,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that covers it.

1026
01:51:59,858 --> 01:52:00,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's it.

1027
01:52:00,618 --> 01:52:00,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1028
01:52:01,598 --> 01:52:02,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thank you.

1029
01:52:02,519 --> 01:52:02,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1030
01:52:05,359 --> 01:52:06,319
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll go next.

1031
01:52:06,819 --> 01:52:07,239
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

1032
01:52:07,339 --> 01:52:07,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1033
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:26,063
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with place and Christie, especially with the shadow study and then also a traffic study so we can see the impacts, especially with the loading of the vehicles and the pedestrians and what mitigation can be can be done for the area.

1034
01:52:33,101 --> 01:52:35,622
[SPEAKER_13]: We're intending to do both.

1035
01:52:35,722 --> 01:52:40,905
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, traffic study is underway with Van Assen associates.

1036
01:52:40,985 --> 01:52:45,088
[SPEAKER_20]: I know they were the same firm that was working with combined properties.

1037
01:52:45,168 --> 01:52:50,490
[SPEAKER_20]: I was at their intro meeting for the potential project across the street.

1038
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,912
[SPEAKER_20]: So yes, we do have some traffic studies underway.

1039
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:54,320
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1040
01:52:54,400 --> 01:53:05,624
[SPEAKER_23]: And once we get a little deeper into developing the building exterior, you will definitely look at shadow studies or share our shadow studies with you and put them in the context with the surrounding buildings.

1041
01:53:05,684 --> 01:53:11,905
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is the thing that we've, as we've masked up the building, we're continuing looking at those.

1042
01:53:12,666 --> 01:53:14,326
[SPEAKER_23]: And so definitely want to share that.

1043
01:53:15,466 --> 01:53:16,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what the

1044
01:53:19,759 --> 01:53:20,660
[SPEAKER_23]: The height is?

1045
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:24,042
[SPEAKER_23]: So 125 feet to the parapet and then a 20 foot, yeah.

1046
01:53:24,322 --> 01:53:28,865
[SPEAKER_23]: And so 125 feet to the parapet and then 20 foot mechanical mezzanine.

1047
01:53:31,267 --> 01:53:31,847
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's the height.

1048
01:53:31,867 --> 01:53:36,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what the combined properties height is across the street?

1049
01:53:37,591 --> 01:53:38,271
[SPEAKER_10]: We should get that.

1050
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:39,512
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll make those comparisons.

1051
01:53:39,612 --> 01:53:41,614
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's get that information and send it to them.

1052
01:53:41,814 --> 01:53:42,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1053
01:53:42,154 --> 01:53:42,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1054
01:53:43,015 --> 01:53:43,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1055
01:53:47,665 --> 01:53:51,566
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I think I don't see George on the right.

1056
01:53:52,806 --> 01:53:54,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sorry he had to step away.

1057
01:53:55,147 --> 01:53:55,907
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, no problem.

1058
01:53:56,387 --> 01:53:58,688
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that I'm, I'm batting last that that's fine.

1059
01:53:59,548 --> 01:54:01,429
[SPEAKER_21]: No problem.

1060
01:54:02,769 --> 01:54:04,710
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Deanna is that, are you good.

1061
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:06,770
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to cut you off.

1062
01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:07,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I'm good.

1063
01:54:08,111 --> 01:54:08,551
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, thanks.

1064
01:54:08,931 --> 01:54:09,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1065
01:54:11,332 --> 01:54:15,213
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I guess, I feel like the design of the building from

1066
01:54:16,795 --> 01:54:22,557
[SPEAKER_21]: A marketability point of view, maybe you're not that worried about it if you have somebody who wants it this way.

1067
01:54:23,697 --> 01:54:33,119
[SPEAKER_21]: But I can't help but share my instinctive reaction which is you're going to have a hard time finding successor tenants, when you have almost no parking whatsoever.

1068
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,980
[SPEAKER_21]: If you try to do something different with the building.

1069
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:46,163
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just, it just strikes me as it's going to be an impediment to the subsequent tenants or your sale of the building to, to somebody else but that's just my two cents.

1070
01:54:48,283 --> 01:54:53,326
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to address that right now.

1071
01:54:53,506 --> 01:55:02,290
[SPEAKER_20]: We believe, because of our industry knowledge, that this building will consistently be incubator space, number one.

1072
01:55:02,771 --> 01:55:06,793
[SPEAKER_20]: Number two, we're not planning to develop this and sell this.

1073
01:55:07,473 --> 01:55:11,055
[SPEAKER_20]: We are actually partnering with the incubator group.

1074
01:55:11,415 --> 01:55:15,077
[SPEAKER_20]: They want us on as a small equity partner.

1075
01:55:16,097 --> 01:55:23,701
[SPEAKER_20]: And we plan to stay on with them and basically keep this building as is for that's obviously the initial plan.

1076
01:55:24,701 --> 01:55:36,107
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, I hear what you're saying, because that does come up right with, especially with lending partners right money partners they're always like if we're going to bring money to this to this building.

1077
01:55:36,927 --> 01:55:41,329
[SPEAKER_20]: what happens if you need to change out the tenant type, right?

1078
01:55:41,749 --> 01:55:49,192
[SPEAKER_20]: So we do think about that, but we have spent a lot of time and energy really understanding the life science market.

1079
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:55,774
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's why we feel very confident in designing the building this way.

1080
01:55:56,654 --> 01:56:02,897
[SPEAKER_20]: The other thing I would say, and you're absolutely correct, David, if we change the asset classes with the parking.

1081
01:56:03,979 --> 01:56:08,235
[SPEAKER_20]: But with the biotech and the life science companies, we think

1082
01:56:09,342 --> 01:56:11,083
[SPEAKER_20]: pushing less parking is important.

1083
01:56:11,203 --> 01:56:14,704
[SPEAKER_20]: And those are things that we're hearing from companies.

1084
01:56:15,005 --> 01:56:20,407
[SPEAKER_20]: They want accessibility that doesn't require driving to work.

1085
01:56:20,707 --> 01:56:22,708
[SPEAKER_20]: And so that's, again, why we chose this site.

1086
01:56:22,748 --> 01:56:26,610
[SPEAKER_20]: But you do bring up a great point in terms of successor tenants.

1087
01:56:26,690 --> 01:56:32,553
[SPEAKER_20]: So we will definitely think about that as we're presenting this in the future.

1088
01:56:33,413 --> 01:56:34,874
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a good thing to think about.

1089
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:56,057
[SPEAKER_23]: One of the realities of this type of building too is because of the structural requirements and the utility space and the amount of mechanical equipment and the type of mechanical equipment that the building has, they don't convert easily into

1090
01:56:57,767 --> 01:57:01,049
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, office buildings or residential buildings.

1091
01:57:02,009 --> 01:57:03,290
[SPEAKER_23]: A different type of science, maybe.

1092
01:57:04,150 --> 01:57:09,813
[SPEAKER_23]: But that's sort of more likely the type of evolution that the property would have.

1093
01:57:09,833 --> 01:57:09,913
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1094
01:57:09,933 --> 01:57:11,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1095
01:57:11,553 --> 01:57:12,074
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1096
01:57:15,315 --> 01:57:24,960
[SPEAKER_21]: In addition to the sort of street level views, I guess at some point it would be also nice to understand exactly what your top floor or

1097
01:57:27,461 --> 01:57:42,246
[SPEAKER_21]: mechanical level is is going to appear, or how it will appear to the neighborhood as well because I imagine that much of the city will be able to see that, or maybe you'll be concealing and it won't be seen but that would be I think something that the public would also be interested in.

1098
01:57:45,859 --> 01:57:51,882
[SPEAKER_21]: Usually we ask about electrical vehicle parking and that sort of thing that may not be relevant here.

1099
01:57:52,482 --> 01:58:04,788
[SPEAKER_21]: But we do always ask about other things such as bike storage, you know, showers, that sort of thing which I imagine is on your shortlist given the audience, the potential employees you're trying to attract to the building.

1100
01:58:05,988 --> 01:58:06,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

1101
01:58:07,509 --> 01:58:09,090
[SPEAKER_21]: So those are always of interest to us.

1102
01:58:13,005 --> 01:58:23,973
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't have to answer this now, but it'd just be interesting to hear a little bit about what your construction plan is, because you've got no elbow room.

1103
01:58:24,053 --> 01:58:24,753
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you going to do it?

1104
01:58:26,887 --> 01:58:31,972
[SPEAKER_23]: find find a lay down site and rent space, maybe right.

1105
01:58:32,273 --> 01:58:33,434
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1106
01:58:33,854 --> 01:58:38,559
[SPEAKER_23]: Which is I think what the site is used for right now, someone else's construction.

1107
01:58:40,541 --> 01:58:45,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, yeah, no that's a, that is a good question and we will have some discussion about that.

1108
01:58:46,868 --> 01:58:57,030
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, we will make sure we hire a construction company that has a good reputation, right, that that is has worked in spaces like this or in tight quarters.

1109
01:58:57,110 --> 01:58:59,631
[SPEAKER_20]: So because it is, it will be an issue.

1110
01:58:59,651 --> 01:59:04,092
[SPEAKER_20]: There's as, as Clay's already mentioned, there's a lot of traffic there at certain times of the day.

1111
01:59:04,172 --> 01:59:07,413
[SPEAKER_20]: So we want to try to minimize any impact that we have.

1112
01:59:09,013 --> 01:59:09,954
[SPEAKER_20]: as much as we can.

1113
01:59:10,114 --> 01:59:11,615
[SPEAKER_20]: So yes, thanks for bringing that up.

1114
01:59:12,636 --> 01:59:17,460
[SPEAKER_23]: I've sat in that line of traffic many times over the years, and I'm very familiar with the intersection.

1115
01:59:18,721 --> 01:59:32,311
[SPEAKER_23]: DPR did a construction traffic plan for us with the Chelsea project, and we'll be doing that again in these early stages as this continues, because that's another sort of ballet of

1116
01:59:33,752 --> 01:59:43,918
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, which times of day are we really feasibly going to be able to deliver this equipment and materials and so forth to where, how does it get from where it's stored to the site?

1117
01:59:44,438 --> 01:59:51,583
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is a pretty in-depth planning exercise that we're going to engage as we get a little deeper into the process.

1118
01:59:52,363 --> 01:59:59,827
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I imagine if you were putting this up in Cambridge, that's par for the course over there, but it feels like it's an entirely different scenario for us to see it here.

1119
02:00:00,248 --> 02:00:00,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1120
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:09,634
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess on the public transportation, and I had some questions I tried to answer for myself this week.

1121
02:00:12,481 --> 02:00:24,425
[SPEAKER_21]: You would, I think in one of the images showed the potential for a bus stop and I don't know how feasible that is because it seems so close to the intersection but putting that aside just the, the 95 bus route.

1122
02:00:24,925 --> 02:00:37,729
[SPEAKER_21]: You know I know again this is the MBTA and I see one thing on one part of the website and I see another on the other side and I don't know which is which but there seem to be some plans to reduce 95 or shifted over more to main street.

1123
02:00:41,011 --> 02:01:02,123
[SPEAKER_21]: So, coming off the discussion about the comprehensive plan it's a shame that we're, we're thinking about areas that are prime for development in this city where the MBTA is looking to cut back service but I just, I don't know what the future plans are there and I don't know how that's going to work with, with what you're what you're planning for your building.

1124
02:01:02,798 --> 02:01:32,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think we were thinking more along the lines of less bus route usage and more driving the employees working in the building to places like the Tufts Station or Ball Square Station or even Wellington Station or Davis Square, and having a shuttle service at specific times of the day where it picks them up there, brings them to the building, drops them off, and then there's no need for the bus route or even parking.

1125
02:01:33,006 --> 02:01:39,039
[SPEAKER_20]: That's been what we've been thinking about because I think that all of those stations are close enough.

1126
02:01:39,926 --> 02:01:49,110
[SPEAKER_20]: that we could commission some shuttle service that's already doing shuttle trips during the day to add in some of these or even have very specific ones just for this building.

1127
02:01:50,430 --> 02:01:52,711
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's something we put a lot of thought into.

1128
02:01:52,731 --> 02:02:00,334
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's more along the lines of where I think it'll be more functional as opposed to pushing these companies to say, hey, use the bus, right?

1129
02:02:01,095 --> 02:02:08,397
[SPEAKER_20]: And one of the things we've been thinking about is approaching the MBTA and saying, can you subsidize some of these things or how can we work together to make this work?

1130
02:02:08,678 --> 02:02:08,958
[SPEAKER_20]: What's that?

1131
02:02:09,818 --> 02:02:10,058
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1132
02:02:10,198 --> 02:02:10,459
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1133
02:02:10,619 --> 02:02:11,159
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah.

1134
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:11,580
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah.

1135
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:12,681
[SPEAKER_20]: And city bikes too.

1136
02:02:12,941 --> 02:02:14,142
[SPEAKER_20]: And blue bikes and things like that.

1137
02:02:14,183 --> 02:02:20,369
[SPEAKER_20]: But in terms of leveraging the actual train stations, I think that's the way to go.

1138
02:02:21,290 --> 02:02:21,970
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's worked.

1139
02:02:23,072 --> 02:02:26,615
[SPEAKER_20]: We stole that from some other developments.

1140
02:02:26,635 --> 02:02:29,999
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a development in, where is that at?

1141
02:02:31,187 --> 02:02:36,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Abbey labs in Natick.

1142
02:02:36,955 --> 02:02:40,561
[SPEAKER_20]: So they are about a mile from the Natick train station and that's what they do.

1143
02:02:41,001 --> 02:02:45,247
[SPEAKER_20]: They have a shuttle that picks people up at certain times, it just brings them directly to their building and they said,

1144
02:02:45,788 --> 02:02:58,321
[SPEAKER_20]: The tenants will love that, because it's just very easy for them to get to that station, get the shuttle right to the building they don't have to worry about parking or even riding bikes and, and a lot of them you know during the summer will walk that distance but when the weather gets not as nice here.

1145
02:02:58,762 --> 02:03:04,087
[SPEAKER_20]: It's good to have those types of ideas, so we're definitely considering that as a strategy.

1146
02:03:06,009 --> 02:03:07,371
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I like the sound of that.

1147
02:03:08,891 --> 02:03:22,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We also utilize that service quite a bit when we were in the lab at Brigham, taking the shuttle to all the way to Cambridge and then or to the different train stations that are close by.

1148
02:03:23,574 --> 02:03:27,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So we definitely utilize that service quite a bit and it was free service for us.

1149
02:03:27,155 --> 02:03:37,838
[SPEAKER_05]: So we plan to bring all the things that worked out for us and has been working for all of our colleagues currently.

1150
02:03:39,478 --> 02:03:42,342
[SPEAKER_05]: and bring it into this building utilize what's working.

1151
02:03:45,185 --> 02:03:52,935
[SPEAKER_21]: It is a different presentation that will be usually see in, in terms of the parking because you're usually it's well we're a little bit short.

1152
02:03:54,982 --> 02:04:07,189
[SPEAKER_05]: We're definitely trying to promote less driving, less pollution, more using the services that already exist out there.

1153
02:04:07,389 --> 02:04:16,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's definitely a thing that we like to stay environmentally friendly as much as possible, given the type of building this is.

1154
02:04:18,645 --> 02:04:35,851
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's an interesting me, you're, you're much more invested in the success of those types of programs because you haven't given the folks the other alternative, you know, so the sincerity of your, of your interest in getting that kind of a program off the ground is maybe different than some of the other developments we see.

1155
02:04:35,931 --> 02:04:38,612
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a, it's, it's just interesting.

1156
02:04:38,652 --> 02:04:46,714
[SPEAKER_21]: This is all sort of new for us to see a building like this on Mystic Ave and to see parking of, of this smaller number.

1157
02:04:48,715 --> 02:04:52,896
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of things for us to see for the first time and we'll need a little time to digest these you know.

1158
02:04:53,356 --> 02:04:54,696
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1159
02:04:55,976 --> 02:05:10,379
[SPEAKER_20]: This is good for us to it's great to hear all this feedback so that we can, you know, it's, it's easy for us to think that everything, things are going to work but it's also good to hear from you guys to say here's what you know has been worked in the past so the feedback is great.

1160
02:05:10,939 --> 02:05:17,400
[SPEAKER_05]: We also hope that what we're bringing to the city and the ideas that we're trying to implement

1161
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:23,382
[SPEAKER_05]: are aligned with the future of your plans for the city as well.

1162
02:05:27,043 --> 02:05:34,005
[SPEAKER_23]: If I can just take a quick minute to address one of the things that the class brought up that kind of

1163
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:40,782
[SPEAKER_23]: Scooties, zeroed right in, I'm gonna get you a set of grappling whips, you know?

1164
02:05:41,282 --> 02:05:42,163
[SPEAKER_23]: And thank you for that.

1165
02:05:42,463 --> 02:05:45,824
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, the walls that are not glass.

1166
02:05:46,384 --> 02:05:50,026
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, please, yep.

1167
02:05:50,106 --> 02:06:02,771
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't wanna call them blank, and I don't wanna call them those other words, but yeah, no, we completely get how, what type of gesture that could be to the presidential neighborhoods of Atlanta.

1168
02:06:03,411 --> 02:06:04,331
[SPEAKER_23]: behind the building.

1169
02:06:05,352 --> 02:06:08,973
[SPEAKER_23]: But I want to share the challenge that we're up against.

1170
02:06:10,573 --> 02:06:24,997
[SPEAKER_23]: You need to have a fire rated wall when you're within X number of feet, 20 feet of a lot line, 15 feet and you can have windows of a certain size, 10 feet and they're much smaller, five feet and they can have protected openings.

1171
02:06:25,017 --> 02:06:27,358
[SPEAKER_23]: This is all viciously expensive.

1172
02:06:28,279 --> 02:06:33,487
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're at a two foot lot line and a zero lot line on those two walls.

1173
02:06:34,409 --> 02:06:38,175
[SPEAKER_23]: In order to get the leaseable area for this building to pencil.

1174
02:06:39,007 --> 02:06:45,370
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're looking at all sorts of different ways to make that not the wrong thing.

1175
02:06:47,291 --> 02:06:55,615
[SPEAKER_23]: And obviously, there's ways of doing patterns of cladding that work with the pattern of fenestration on the other walls.

1176
02:06:55,915 --> 02:07:03,598
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's a variation between the opacity and opaqueness.

1177
02:07:09,472 --> 02:07:12,633
[SPEAKER_23]: those two zero lot line or small lot line walls.

1178
02:07:13,293 --> 02:07:18,955
[SPEAKER_23]: There are some materials that are translucent that develop a two-hour fire rating.

1179
02:07:19,675 --> 02:07:27,877
[SPEAKER_23]: Looking at those, again, viciously expensive, but we understand that this is, you have to be able to make it right for all four sides.

1180
02:07:27,917 --> 02:07:29,738
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a building that's gonna be a four-sided building.

1181
02:07:30,418 --> 02:07:35,883
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not going to be couched for many years by other buildings.

1182
02:07:37,384 --> 02:07:42,147
[SPEAKER_23]: But that's the challenge that we're up against.

1183
02:07:42,247 --> 02:07:49,933
[SPEAKER_23]: And so how we solve that, and maybe it's going to be how we collaborate to solve that, that's part of the work that's ahead of us.

1184
02:07:52,175 --> 02:07:55,398
[SPEAKER_22]: I have one minor, maybe final comment about

1185
02:07:57,994 --> 02:07:59,455
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe tying into that a little bit.

1186
02:08:02,377 --> 02:08:17,046
[SPEAKER_22]: When you were first presenting, you were sort of calling the design idea like a pure extrusion of the site itself, which I completely agree that that's what we're seeing.

1187
02:08:17,347 --> 02:08:23,390
[SPEAKER_22]: And I sort of wonder whether that gesture is actually the thing that's

1188
02:08:24,949 --> 02:08:28,291
[SPEAKER_22]: that's making those blank walls particularly conspicuous to us.

1189
02:08:29,452 --> 02:08:54,228
[SPEAKER_22]: And I wonder if there's a way to sort of form the back two sides in a way, obviously everything I'm talking about here is minus square footage, but is there a way to sort of release the stranglehold of that pure extrusion and then do something that,

1190
02:08:54,818 --> 02:09:03,584
[SPEAKER_22]: gives a little bit of form on those backsides that would create that relief that I think we're looking for.

1191
02:09:03,644 --> 02:09:14,791
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm sort of thinking of a light well or something where you could throw some glass in there or something.

1192
02:09:15,112 --> 02:09:21,536
[SPEAKER_22]: Because it truly does look like you see in the renderings you have

1193
02:09:22,855 --> 02:09:25,457
[SPEAKER_22]: That you shared with us that, you know, it looks very.

1194
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:31,542
[SPEAKER_22]: Finished on the, you know, on the South and East side, like very.

1195
02:09:32,603 --> 02:09:37,627
[SPEAKER_22]: Civic and very, and then you go around the back and you're like, well, you know, so in a way, I wonder whether.

1196
02:09:43,107 --> 02:09:55,278
[SPEAKER_22]: You're starting to do this on Mystic Ab, but I'm wondering if a little bit of the back actually needs to creep into the front so that there's more of an equilibrium between the solid and the void.

1197
02:09:56,746 --> 02:10:11,394
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that's what I was kind of hinting at is the next set of developments are going to be to maybe add more solids around the glass walls and start to blend those two expressions.

1198
02:10:11,814 --> 02:10:15,316
[SPEAKER_23]: But you kind of triggered me a little bit.

1199
02:10:16,317 --> 02:10:21,260
[SPEAKER_23]: I wonder if there's an opportunity to actually do something sculptural and special on those walls.

1200
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:25,201
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're looking at them as a wall.

1201
02:10:25,221 --> 02:10:31,624
[SPEAKER_23]: But what if there is, we can make the space functional as long as we do.

1202
02:10:32,484 --> 02:10:37,686
[SPEAKER_23]: But we could, what if those walls had a sculptural sort of profile to them?

1203
02:10:37,726 --> 02:10:39,146
[SPEAKER_23]: What if they danced a little bit?

1204
02:10:39,726 --> 02:10:44,248
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is why we collaborate, right?

1205
02:10:44,268 --> 02:10:45,649
[SPEAKER_23]: This is why we kick these ideas around.

1206
02:10:45,669 --> 02:10:49,190
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we want to explore that as well.

1207
02:10:51,898 --> 02:10:55,119
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for that.

1208
02:10:55,139 --> 02:11:12,547
[SPEAKER_21]: Doug and Matt if there's something that you want to come back and see us we have sort of regularly scheduled meetings if you just wanted to come back and and throw a few visuals at us because this is something you know you're kicking stuff around and it's not the full final presentation but you want to

1209
02:11:13,283 --> 02:11:15,785
[SPEAKER_21]: something up on the board, we're happy to give you a reaction.

1210
02:11:16,625 --> 02:11:18,326
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, thank you for that.

1211
02:11:18,426 --> 02:11:29,533
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, let's take another couple of weeks and get a little deeper in, and I think we'll get ourselves back on the agenda, and we appreciate your time and close looking.

1212
02:11:32,795 --> 02:11:33,236
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, well,

1213
02:11:34,779 --> 02:11:41,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Unless there's anything else from the board I would like to thank you very much for your discussion and all the information you've shared with us tonight.

1214
02:11:42,781 --> 02:11:45,401
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your interest in Medford we look forward to seeing you again.

1215
02:11:45,902 --> 02:11:46,582
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, thank you.

1216
02:11:46,662 --> 02:11:47,982
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1217
02:11:48,922 --> 02:11:49,182
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

1218
02:11:49,202 --> 02:12:01,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, next item on the agenda is the approval of what consideration I should say of minutes from November 10 of last year.

1219
02:12:03,848 --> 02:12:05,749
[SPEAKER_21]: Any comments on the minutes?

1220
02:12:09,891 --> 02:12:11,432
[SPEAKER_21]: For myself, I did read them.

1221
02:12:11,952 --> 02:12:14,133
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't have any suggested changes, but.

1222
02:12:14,914 --> 02:12:18,236
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had one that was more like just grammatical.

1223
02:12:18,836 --> 02:12:19,416
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1224
02:12:20,857 --> 02:12:28,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I think where it talks about the configuration to get to the increased number of units, I think it really

1225
02:12:29,259 --> 02:12:33,141
[SPEAKER_08]: should be reconfiguration, it's reconfiguration of the existing space.

1226
02:12:33,421 --> 02:12:39,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a minor thing, but it's the only, she does so good, that was the only thing that jumped out.

1227
02:12:41,426 --> 02:12:42,906
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm kicking myself, I missed that one.

1228
02:12:45,928 --> 02:12:50,791
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, subject to that little change, do we have a motion to approve minutes?

1229
02:12:55,093 --> 02:12:56,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make a motion to approve.

1230
02:12:56,894 --> 02:12:58,055
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent, is there a second?

1231
02:12:59,634 --> 02:13:02,816
[SPEAKER_21]: Outstanding roll call vote then to approve the minutes.

1232
02:13:04,798 --> 02:13:06,019
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice Chair Jackie Furtado.

1233
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:09,782
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually abstain from those minutes.

1234
02:13:10,763 --> 02:13:12,704
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, okay.

1235
02:13:12,904 --> 02:13:16,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I called on you.

1236
02:13:16,207 --> 02:13:19,649
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Christie doubt.

1237
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:20,650
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

1238
02:13:21,551 --> 02:13:22,572
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm an eye as well.

1239
02:13:22,632 --> 02:13:25,194
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we have enough there 123 Yep, we should have enough.

1240
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:29,171
[SPEAKER_07]: David, I just wanted to take a second to introduce you guys.

1241
02:13:29,632 --> 02:13:34,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Wren doesn't usually make the meetings and she wasn't introduced at the beginning.

1242
02:13:34,376 --> 02:13:39,761
[SPEAKER_07]: She's the graduate student from Tufts who's actually been doing the minutes for these meetings all along.

1243
02:13:39,781 --> 02:13:42,484
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just thought- Thank you, Wren.

1244
02:13:42,564 --> 02:13:45,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody else was gone to take a second to introduce Wren.

1245
02:13:45,667 --> 02:13:48,029
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been with our office since last June.

1246
02:13:49,211 --> 02:13:50,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Wren, you're doing a great job.

1247
02:13:51,332 --> 02:13:58,703
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think we've, we've seen the minutes like for me not to have any comments on the minutes, Amanda, go ahead.

1248
02:13:58,743 --> 02:13:59,524
[SPEAKER_21]: You can make fun of me.

1249
02:14:00,885 --> 02:14:02,628
[SPEAKER_21]: That's you're doing a great job.

1250
02:14:03,650 --> 02:14:07,692
[SPEAKER_21]: So I do appreciate it, and it really helps to have the minutes squared away.

1251
02:14:08,193 --> 02:14:11,415
[SPEAKER_21]: And so that we don't go back and forth over them, we can quickly approve them.

1252
02:14:12,675 --> 02:14:18,839
[SPEAKER_21]: And it is important to get the record straight, obviously, so we understand what we did and why we did it.

1253
02:14:18,959 --> 02:14:21,701
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you very much for your efforts.

1254
02:14:21,721 --> 02:14:23,201
[SPEAKER_21]: We really appreciate it as a board.

1255
02:14:25,183 --> 02:14:25,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks, everyone.

1256
02:14:26,643 --> 02:14:30,246
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually enjoy doing them, and I enjoy sitting in on the meetings too, believe it or not.

1257
02:14:32,106 --> 02:14:33,546
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why you're in the program you're in, right?

1258
02:14:34,006 --> 02:14:40,128
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be the first time I've ever heard anyone say that they enjoy doing meeting minutes, but that's impressive.

1259
02:14:41,188 --> 02:14:43,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Wren is a born planner.

1260
02:14:43,309 --> 02:14:47,450
[SPEAKER_07]: She did engineering as her undergrad, but she is like a zoning nerd.

1261
02:14:47,990 --> 02:14:51,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had her re-watch zoning meetings, like the city council.

1262
02:14:51,871 --> 02:14:55,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, what exactly did we say at that point?

1263
02:14:56,372 --> 02:14:58,473
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just, she's going to be a great planner.

1264
02:14:58,953 --> 02:14:59,933
[SPEAKER_07]: She is a great planner.

1265
02:15:00,841 --> 02:15:01,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

1266
02:15:01,341 --> 02:15:01,921
[SPEAKER_21]: Good job, Brennan.

1267
02:15:02,281 --> 02:15:03,902
[SPEAKER_21]: You've chosen the right field.

1268
02:15:03,942 --> 02:15:04,382
[SPEAKER_21]: Good for you.

1269
02:15:07,143 --> 02:15:07,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1270
02:15:07,403 --> 02:15:08,063
[SPEAKER_21]: Any other updates?

1271
02:15:08,103 --> 02:15:10,404
[SPEAKER_21]: Amanda, do you have anything for us?

1272
02:15:12,064 --> 02:15:18,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing too new on my end, unless Alicia or Danielle or anyone had things they wanted to throw in.

1273
02:15:19,407 --> 02:15:20,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want to mention next meeting?

1274
02:15:21,688 --> 02:15:22,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

1275
02:15:23,469 --> 02:15:29,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so we do have a meeting on the books February 1st.

1276
02:15:30,693 --> 02:15:37,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, the only thing that is on the agenda is an A&R discussion.

1277
02:15:39,837 --> 02:15:40,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think it'll be

1278
02:15:41,705 --> 02:15:46,566
[SPEAKER_02]: quick, unless something wild comes up in the next two weeks.

1279
02:15:48,486 --> 02:15:56,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if anyone has any questions about that, or if they expect that they may not be able to attend, just let me know.

1280
02:15:57,148 --> 02:16:00,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as we have quorum, then we're good to go.

1281
02:16:02,489 --> 02:16:02,829
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

1282
02:16:04,789 --> 02:16:08,930
[SPEAKER_21]: So on that note, a motion to adjourn could be entertained at this point.

1283
02:16:15,857 --> 02:16:16,718
[SPEAKER_21]: I will make that motion.

1284
02:16:18,218 --> 02:16:19,859
[SPEAKER_21]: And second on the motion to adjourn.

1285
02:16:20,899 --> 02:16:21,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second.

1286
02:16:22,419 --> 02:16:22,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Excellent.

1287
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:28,581
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll call vice chair, Jackie for topic.

1288
02:16:29,221 --> 02:16:29,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1289
02:16:30,422 --> 02:16:30,962
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1290
02:16:31,662 --> 02:16:31,862
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1291
02:16:32,703 --> 02:16:33,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1292
02:16:34,123 --> 02:16:34,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1293
02:16:35,483 --> 02:16:36,384
[SPEAKER_21]: And I mean yes as well.

1294
02:16:36,924 --> 02:16:40,565
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone thanks for your time and attention tonight, we'll see you in a couple of weeks.

1295
02:16:42,465 --> 02:16:43,191
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you all.

1296
02:16:43,292 --> 02:16:43,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1297
02:16:44,098 --> 02:16:44,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.

1298
02:16:44,783 --> 02:16:45,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.
