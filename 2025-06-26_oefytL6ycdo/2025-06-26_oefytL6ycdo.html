    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=263.944s">Annie,</a>  who I understand is familiar to you all, is going to share the screen, and you'll hear from myself, Brie Hensel, that agency, Annie, who also reached us and joined us from a circuitous planning route, and Emily Innes with Innes Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=280.509s">So</a>  you'll hear from each of us to share parts and pieces of the plan.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=284.39s">And</a>  nice to see you all, and nice to be back.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=289.352s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=291.674s">Like</a>  I said, thank you so much for having us. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=293.354s">We</a>  know this is a really important plan for the city, and also we hope it will be a useful tool for you all in the years to come as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=303.137s">We</a>  hope tonight to share some updates that have changed to the plan, thanks to a lot of community feedback, staff pouring over the plan, feedback from boards and commissions and city council that have led to some updates since we last met with you in July, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=323.787s">I'll</a>  just echo Alicia's huge thank you to the steering committee who was really fun to work with, fun, passionate, passionate for Medford, passionate for the plan, really had lots of great ideas about every kind of nook and cranny and different facet that we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=340.915s">So</a>  they really helped to create and co-create this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=344.177s">And</a>  I think we captured everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=346.198s">It's</a>  nice to see the faces in the room from the steering committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=349.039s">Again,</a>  it's been a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=351.358s">And</a>  I just wanted to mention also Jackie Furtado, who I saw, who I know wears so many hats, but was always with us, really thoughtful in the steering committee too. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=362.342s">The</a>  team beyond me included a few other planners from Agency Landscape and Planning, a data visualization and community engagement specialist who helped us get over a thousand comments on an online map, as well as created some informational videos, Chris Landau, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=381.688s">We</a>  had local transportation planners from Arab, and then we also had CARP strategies diving into economic development and housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=389.514s">So</a>  this was kind of really a comprehensive team to think about the different pieces of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=396.495s">We've</a>  been working on this with you and with the steering committee since about spring of 2021 guided by a lot of community engagement along the way, a lot of fun workshops with the steering committee, and then just about the time that we saw you in July is when we were releasing for public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=415.783s">the</a>  first draft of the plan itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=417.705s">And</a>  so that was shared with the steering committee, with the community, and with a lot of workshops internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=424.57s">Over</a>  the last about six months, we've been receiving those comments, making sure that there's a lot of ample time for feedback and review and re-review. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=434.717s">And</a>  so we've now revised that draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=438.179s">We'll</a>  show you some of the changes, kind of walk through that, and then walk through the shape of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=446.023s">I'll</a>  talk a little bit about what this comprehensive plan is meant to do, why it's happening in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=451.409s">It's</a>  guided and directed by Massachusetts General Laws, and it's governed by Chapter 41, Section 81D, which generally says that the plan will address the nine different elements, which include the different topical areas that you see at the bottom, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=466.516s">everything</a>  from land use to history to mobility, and also make sure that the plan has goals, makes policy statements, and lays out an implementation plan so that these ideas can be achieved and incorporated to city practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=480.626s">It's</a>  meant to be high level because of its comprehensive nature, and it's meant to be implemented through other studies that drill down or through kind of internal initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=489.712s">So</a>  it's meant to be this vision that ties together a lot of community feedback <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=494.474s">into</a>  a cohesive shared picture of the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=501.22s">Ultimately,</a>  the idea is that the plan will lay out a 10 year action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=505.664s">So</a>  as we get into the implementation plan, you'll start to see really tangible ideas, really tangible actions that hopefully will be accomplished and kind of taken on as initiatives in the coming years. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=517.0s">But</a>  then it also looks at this 30 year planning horizon when it defines the vision goal statements for what Medford wants to be in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=525.948s">It's</a>  going to set out policies that will give direction to city departments, talks about investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=532.694s">So</a>  thinking about capital investment, capital improvements, where to spend operating funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=538.78s">One</a>  of the things that we heard a lot about was <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=542.518s">Yes,</a>  this plan is full of great ideas, but who's going to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=546.36s">We</a>  need staff and resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=547.88s">And</a>  so that's something we've thought a lot about on the implementation side. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=550.701s">We'll</a>  share some more of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=552.302s">But</a>  it really thinks about needed staff, needed investment and partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=557.464s">It</a>  sets you up for regulatory changes that can make some of this possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=562.106s">And</a>  it's meant also to make a pathway for ongoing community discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=566.908s">There</a>  were a lot of great conversations that started in this process that we hope will carry forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=574.563s">So</a>  since we last saw you in July, what has been happening we've had about over 600 comments on the draft plan and total a really deep dive from city staff, which was. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=586.14s">really</a>  helpful, the folks who are going to implement this, who know kind of on the ground, how pieces will come together, what's possible, what's feasible, where ambitions should be higher or adjusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=598.743s">We</a>  got over 400 from city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=601.304s">We</a>  got 125 comments from residents, almost 100 unique online views. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=606.626s">So</a>  really great that people were engaging with the plan, giving feedback, and we've gone line by line through all of those different <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=616.279s">different</a>  points of feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=618.382s">This</a>  team, Alicia and Amanda and her team really considered everyone and tried to address them in the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=628.023s">So</a>  we'll show you a few of the bigger picture changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=631.505s">One</a>  thing that shifted with some of the feedback was actually the order of the chapters. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=635.547s">We</a>  started before always with opening and engaged communication, which really felt like this sort of overarching picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=642.071s">And</a>  we've now moved up from the end to second, welcoming and supportive neighborhoods, because that was really such a resounding idea that came through from community engagement, as well as feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=653.477s">We</a>  wanted to make sure it was front and center, what people see when they first open the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=658.078s">We</a>  also have made some changes for usability so are highlighting kind of the topical areas and functional areas, as we go through the different goals and actions you can understand this might affect housing in the city this might affect. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=672.273s">economic</a>  development, it might affect history. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=674.974s">And</a>  that's not only meant to kind of organize things, but also to be call outs to advocacy groups or partners or passionate volunteers about open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=683.216s">You</a>  can kind of quickly at a glance, figure out which recommendations align with what you're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=692.799s">We</a>  introduced a section up front to orient people to the different areas within Medford that we refer to a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=700.242s">So</a>  we're calling this places, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=702.122s">References</a>  to places and areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=703.782s">It's</a>  meant to kind of make sure people know geographically. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=708.123s">What</a>  are we saying when we say hillside? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=710.324s">Where</a>  are we talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=711.384s">So</a>  make sure just everyone has kind of a level understanding of how the city is knit together by these different neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=722.206s">And</a>  then on the kind of meatier content side, as we got into the implementation chapter, that's probably changed and grown quite a bit from what you saw before. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=731.544s">got</a>  a lot of really good feedback about the implementation chapter and kind of what was needed to set up the city for success. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=739.775s">And</a>  the chapter now really emphasizes the need for investment in staff and administrative resources, whether those human resources or space. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=749.693s">to</a>  support implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=750.955s">It</a>  also digs into the relationship and the strategy between having a relationship between economic development, infrastructure investments, and generating more tax revenue so you can make all of this happen.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=781.012s">Should</a>  I keep going? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=781.592s">I'll</a>  keep going.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=782.453s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=784.554s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=785.514s">And</a>  then finally, it identifies priority actions and first steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=790.516s">So</a>  where do we start, including some recommendations for zoning, how might you attack kind of thinking about different zoning changes, and then future land use actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=804.286s">So</a>  as we get further into the presentation, Emily is gonna dive into the implementation chapter and share that with you too. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=810.231s">What</a>  didn't change is that the plan is still really driven by all the feedback that we received, not just in the last six months, but in the whole kind of 18 months of the plan itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=820.86s">So</a>  all of the in-person engagement, website and digital engagement and the focus groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=827.765s">So</a>  really grateful for all of that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=832.869s">What</a>  that did was it set us up to understand patterns of city values and needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=837.732s">You</a>  can see we heard about special places, a lot of those on the river, some issues, many of those on roads, and then ideas, many of those in Medford Square, but really in all the neighborhoods across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=854.08s">And</a>  we got to brainstorm some of these place-based improvements and understand how the policies <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=859.627s">The</a>  capital improvements, the ideas in here will make a difference on the ground in the experience of the city for residents in years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=872.395s">So</a>  ultimately what we'll show you now, we'll walk through these five plan themes that were shaped by that community feedback, open and engaged communication, a welcoming and supportive community, vibrant places, access for all and climate resiliency.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=889.279s">Those</a>  are really the pillars of the plan, and they also shape that long-term, like we said, 30-year vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=899.023s">And</a>  with that, I'll pass it back to our friend and yours, Annie. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=903.224s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=904.225s">Thanks,</a>  Brie. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=906.444s">So</a>  before we get into kind of the five themes, we wanted to take a bit of a step back and I'll move pretty quickly through this since there's a lot of overlap with what we shared with you all last summer and also since you've been sitting with the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=921.723s">but</a>  thinking about the fact that Medford has done a lot of planning work at different levels and on different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=927.828s">And</a>  so part of the role of this plan is to really bring together current and past plans and to understand how these components relate holistically to one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=936.193s">And</a>  so we looked at the history of land use and development in Medford and considered that together with current trends and citywide patterns. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=948.102s">And</a>  then <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=948.865s">projecting</a>  that out to the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=950.886s">And</a>  so this is sort of, the future land use map is this diagrammatic way of thinking about the different areas in Medford and the strategies this plan has for addressing those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=962.254s">So</a>  here you can see some highlighted elements such as the green corridor along the rivers, gateway entries to the city shown there in blue, civic and institutional anchors, those centers and squares of economic activity, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=977.772s">and</a>  then also kind of smaller, more village centers at the neighborhood scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=981.294s">And</a>  so thinking about how all these different areas of investment and a different character relate to one another and what they look like in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=992.319s">And</a>  so, as Brie mentioned, the five building blocks really came out of community engagement and input, and all of these were themes that were refined over the course of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1005.657s">And</a>  these were open and engaged communication, welcoming and supportive neighborhoods, vibrant places, access for all, and climate resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1017.147s">So</a>  we'll dig into those just a little bit to provide a high level overview of what these look like, but there are many more actions and elements within the chapters themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1028.156s">So</a>  I encourage everyone to take a closer look and looking forward to discussion with you all after this. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1034.685s">So</a>  first, open and engaged communication, and this includes the relationship between the community and City Hall, how plans like these get implemented over time, allocation of funding, and how the City relates to other potential partners who can help to implement elements of this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1052.229s">So</a>  some of the goals that came out here were to grow and strengthen community trust, to implement the plan according to community-supported priorities, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1064.677s">and</a>  also allocating resources effectively to make sure that this plan can be effective going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1070.038s">And</a>  so just to highlight a few of the actions that are contained in this chapter, the plan recommends issuing an annual comprehensive plan update that will show progress made on the plan and really create that transparency with the community about actions that have been taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1090.981s">Offering</a>  communication and training to <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1094.468s">residents</a>  and staff, including mediation training and thinking about how we're communicating with the rest of the community, tracking participation demographics in planning processes and on boards to really see who's in the room and how we can expand the reach of both membership of boards and commissions, but also of who's engaged in public processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1121.924s">And</a>  then also identifying partners who can help to implement this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1124.965s">There</a>  are a lot of actions and recommendations and steps in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1128.887s">So</a>  how can the city now do this alone and thinking about how to strategically allocate some of these steps to some supporting organizations and partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1143.473s">So</a>  the second building block or theme is a welcoming and supportive community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1147.414s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1150.264s">One</a>  of the big goals here is ensuring affordable housing for all and housing was a big theme that came forth throughout the engagement process. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1158.84s">As</a>  Brie mentioned, part of moving this chapter up in the structure of the plan was really to emphasize kind of the weight of that piece within the plan and the emphasis on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1169.765s">And</a>  this plan builds a lot on the housing production plan that was recently completed, but really emphasizing that the affordable housing goal is a main component of this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1182.053s">Another</a>  goal within this theme is enlivening open spaces and facilities and really having those Medford's abundant open space, really leveraging that and making it be the most welcoming and supportive and engaging places that they can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1198.367s">And</a>  then also honoring Medford's rich history, roots and culture that are really present throughout the neighborhoods and how we can bring those to the forefront and think about how to leverage those resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1212.695s">And</a>  so highlighting a few examples of actions here, diversifying housing options by allowing multifamily and small diverse housing options through zoning changes, retrofitting existing facilities for universal accessibility, and beautifying centers by working with local artists to highlight history and culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1235.151s">So</a>  kind of that mix of addressing affordability and open space and</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1242.904s">and</a>  history and arts and culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1247.886s">And</a>  then the third theme or building block is cyberplaces.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1251.708s">And</a>  this relates to economic development and land use and open space and how these work together to kind of create a more vibrant and active community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1263.435s">And</a>  a few goals here were something that was heard a lot in engagement was about creating these live and work communities in Bedford and sort of the 12 and 18 hour communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1275.08s">So</a>  having something to do and extending the hours of when these resources are available and activities happening in centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1285.605s">Also</a>  supporting businesses and the workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1288.146s">So</a>  through workforce training and making sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1292.193s">economic</a>  development growth in Medford supports Medford residents and the members of the community are prepared with the skills and resources for that growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1303.978s">And</a>  then increasing the enjoyment of natural resources, also within this by replacement element and balancing growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1311.102s">So</a>  really seeing <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1313.033s">you</a>  know, the areas that are appropriate for growth and how to balance that with investment in infrastructure and transportation to really make sure that the investments needed are in place to support that growth.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1330.005s">So</a>  a few actions here that we'll highlight are</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1335.443s">Leveraging</a>  city-owned parcels to develop and promote multi-family residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1340.465s">Attracting</a>  companies that will provide well-being jobs to residents in Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1346.086s">And</a>  encouraging that small-scale neighborhood retail and services to provide services within neighborhoods and those walkable communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1358.991s">So</a>  then the fourth theme or building block here is access for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1363.657s">And</a>  this relates to mobility and facilities and services and how people get around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1369.821s">And</a>  so the goals here relate to connecting multi-mobile networks and building on recent investments that have been made and really creating the connections between where people want to go in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1383.429s">As</a>  I mentioned a bit with Fiber Police is to coordinating that mobility and development so that where growth is happening, there is the transportation infrastructure to support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1393.848s">And</a>  then improving the mobility experience for all users. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1396.929s">So</a>  from pedestrians and bikers to transit users and universal accessibility, really making sure that experience is improved for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1411.134s">So</a>  a couple of actions that I'll highlight here are auditing pedestrian crossings and school adjacent routes for safe crossings. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1421.054s">working</a>  with the ongoing bicycle master plan update to really create a safe and well-connected network for all users, promoting density and mixed use and walking distance of MBTA train stations and major bus hubs, and then also determining how to integrate currently unaccepted streets into the city ownership, since that was a topic that came up a lot in engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1445.398s">And</a>  then finally, and we sort of move this to the end, not because it's not important, but because it's sort of looking ahead to the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1454.002s">And</a>  also it's building on so much work that the city is already doing with the climate action and adaptation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1462.785s">And</a>  so climate resilience goals within the plan include raising community awareness about the impacts of climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1470.794s">really</a>  achieving and evolving the climate action and adaptation plan so that it's time to support implementation of that plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1478.679s">Preserving</a>  and enhancing my current existing natural resources to really leverage those existing assets, and then supporting community health and resilience. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1488.844s">So</a>  really <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1490.835s">trying</a>  to create the resources necessary to support the Metric community and in particular, environmental justice communities or communities who are at greater risk of negative impacts and climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1506.907s">And</a>  so a few key examples here of actions to highlight are using streets and open spaces for stormwater management, focusing public tree investments in priority areas like places of high heat vulnerability, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1520.934s">adopting</a>  environmental performance standards for large projects, and updating flood resilience and cool surface design guidelines and standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1531.062s">So</a>  with that, I will turn it over to Emily to talk about our implementation section.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1536.266s">Thank</a>  you very much, Annie, and can you all hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1539.608s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1540.368s">So,</a>  as you can see there are a lot of wonderful ideas that came out of the public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1547.612s">And</a>  we've also brought in best practices as we tried to bring the ideas together and figure out ways of categorizing them I think Annie took you through. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1557.237s">both</a>  the, the breakdown of the goals and what we're looking to do based on the comments, but also how some of them apply to the city throughout that's the geographic basis, the implementation plan is a little bit different and if you'll slip to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1574.43s">This</a>  is really figuring out how do you take all these ideas, how do you put them into a framework, not just the themes that Annie went through, but in the form of a plan that the CDB, that the city council, the mayor, other people, other groups, other departments can bring forward and start to implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1596.113s">The</a>  beginning of the implementation section is these high level categories of how do you get the people and the other resources together that can do implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1605.897s">And</a>  then how do you think of prioritization obviously from the city's point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1612.519s">One</a>  idea is the how economic development aligns throughout because economic development has such an impact on everything else that can happen in the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1622.283s">But</a>  from your point of view, the idea of land use and zoning changes and they're scattered throughout the document, but the implementation plan brings them together and we'll talk about those a little bit as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1633.713s">And</a>  then from there, every comprehensive plan will also because of the level of comprehensive plan is at. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1640.238s">it</a>  will identify additional studies that need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1643.821s">And</a>  the important thing about those additional studies is how do we think about continuing to engage the people who have been engaged with the process so far, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1653.79s">This</a>  plan set a standard and actually in this case, this plan followed along from work that the city had already begun to do <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1662.337s">And</a>  really built on that future studies will continue to build and improve the community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1668.76s">So</a>  let's jump into a little bit more detail about the implementation plan and we're going to start off with the zoning strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1675.062s">One</a>  key piece as we heard input back from the first draft is, we need to know more about prioritization and so in the implementation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1685.627s">We've</a>  set it up so that you can see how to really begin thinking about zoning changes from the step of you've completed your recodification as with any recodification there's always some minor tweaks coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1700.069s">You're</a>  working right now on bringing your, your zoning map from having been a mile hour into a digital format, which has been ongoing and really refining that and bringing that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1713.859s">And</a>  so with those updates, it's time to think about the next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1717.802s">So</a>  one thing that we've recommended in talking with city staff is the idea that as zoning changes are made, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1725.528s">bringing</a>  forward policy statements that explain why the zoning change was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1730.391s">What</a>  was it that the city was trying to accomplish with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1734.934s">And</a>  that idea of thinking about policies and zoning fits very neatly with the next couple of recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1743.018s">One</a>  is to really develop a research-based practice of looking what other communities have done in terms of best practices to address zoning changes and zoning change <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1754.525s">processes,</a>  how do you bring the public along, get their input, do something that zoning changes that reflect the values of the community as well as the needs of the city, those should really be combined and so there's best practices around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1770.196s">And</a>  then there's a set of priorities for the next steps in looking at the different neighborhoods and areas that were identified as important during this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1779.862s">And</a>  so we've suggested a topical way of looking at that you can see that on the left hand side, different topics that are threaded throughout this document that could be addressed by zoning changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1791.626s">And</a>  we've also suggested a way of prioritizing them by geography so that's the specific neighborhoods quarters squares that needed additional attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1802.33s">If</a>  you think of the <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1803.43s">comprehensive</a>  plan is sort of up here, now we need to get down to the level of those neighborhoods and centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1809.613s">So</a>  that prioritization for zoning really looks at what can happen quickly, and what needs to happen going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1816.736s">Next</a>  slide, Annie. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1819.115s">So</a>  another component, and this is coming out more and more in community planning processes is before when you did, you know, the earlier stages of an implementation was you just listed the action, and then it became no you need to do the action, the partners, the timeline and we're going to talk about how this implementation <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1839.514s">plan</a>  does all of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1841.095s">But</a>  now best practices for community planning is really about establishing benchmarks for measuring the success of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1848.178s">So,</a>  in this case, the idea of getting the relevant departments together and understanding what are their goals, what are the goals for different city boards and committees, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1859.883s">And</a>  then how do you measure that those goals or those actions have been successfully implemented? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1865.126s">So</a>  we've given an example here of how you might do that for neighborhoods that are more welcoming and supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1871.729s">How</a>  do you know that you've done that? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1873.269s">Well,</a>  we see an increase in certain trends, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1877.211s">They</a>  may be housing units, historic designations, we see <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1881.193s">an</a>  increase in diversity, we see an increase in children who live within a 10 minute walk of a playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1888.238s">We</a>  see a decrease in the percentage of population that is housing cost burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1892.601s">So</a>  it's the idea of figuring out initially, what are the trends that spell success, and then for some things, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1899.845s">As</a>  you go forward with implementing the plan you may want to establish specific metrics you may want to say, it's not enough that our housing units are increasing we want to increase our housing units by this amount or affordable housing units by this amount and that's really a department by department conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1922.477s">And</a>  so another way of doing that is what was the impact of the work that we as a city are doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1929.022s">And</a>  so here's an example, you can see by the colored dots here of a way of thinking about how you can take a single area and measure the impact of the plan by seeing how many of the goals have actually been applied to the area, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1943.432s">So</a>  if all of these things have been completed or a portion of these things have been completed, then you know that you're really addressing <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1951.498s">the</a>  needs of that particular area of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1954.28s">And</a>  so the plan breaks these down as ways to think about the fact that you're making progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1962.388s">Next</a>  slide, please, Annie. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1964.378s">So</a>  there's two sections that I want to sort of call your attention to. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1968.92s">And</a>  we've got two ways of reading these sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1972.362s">The</a>  first is the objectives and actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1974.984s">And</a>  Annie hit those at a very high level. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1976.965s">So</a>  you can see how they work through thematically. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1980.827s">What</a>  you'll do when you go to the plan itself is you'll see how these are broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1986.11s">So</a>  you see the goal, you see the supporting goal, the sub goal underneath. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1992.753s">the</a>  objection for that goal, and then the specific actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1995.695s">And</a>  so these are laid out so you can see the real details behind why these goals are important and how each of the actions or the objectives support those goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2007.442s">And</a>  then in this case, certainly on this page and many others, there are quotes from the community engagement that are directly associated with these goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2016.948s">And</a>  then if you go to the next slide, please, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2020.052s">So</a>  that's great, we've got those listings, those came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2023.815s">This</a>  is where we get into the components I mentioned earlier, that idea of who's doing this, you know, how did they get started, how do we track progress, and where do we go for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2036.024s">And</a>  so, if you go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2041.15s">The</a>  next piece is this table. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2043.332s">And</a>  again, we've used this slide to show how to read the table, but basically it'll show you the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2049.537s">It'll</a>  show you the actions, who the partners are. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2053.32s">Many</a>  of them are city departments, which is where we get back to that idea of, do we have the right amount of staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2059.045s">Do</a>  the staff have the right resources to do what they need to do to achieve these goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2064.109s">Some</a>  of them are boards, committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2067.151s">And</a>  then some of the partners are not, in fact, city groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2072.453s">So</a>  you may have a city steward, the lead department or the lead position for an action. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2079.175s">And</a>  then partners may be other city departments, but they may also be institutions or nonprofits or other people who have <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2086.818s">a</a>  vested interest in the success of that action being completed or expertise in that particular task. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2093.889s">So</a>  for example, some of the arts-based organizations <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2100.293s">may</a>  be partners for some of the arts based actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2104.516s">And</a>  then we have a list of projects that the city is working on now, you don't plan in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2112.041s">And</a>  so this gives an idea of what's been done to date, and it helps with what should be the next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2120.326s">The</a>  next slide please. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2122.19s">So</a>  that's an overview of implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2124.731s">This</a>  idea that the beginning of the section lays out some of the priorities, especially for this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2130.014s">I</a>  mean, the comprehensive plan is a planning document for the CDB, as well as for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2136.436s">So</a>  it gives you some ideas, particularly on the zoning and the land use, but also on other components and how they work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2142.839s">You</a>  see how the tables work for identifying all of the actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2147.161s">And</a>  now it's really a chance for us to say, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2151.763s">both</a>  to the CDB obviously for working with us and for all of the many people, the steering committee, all of the people who took time out to provide comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2163.888s">Under</a>  section 81D, the CDB is the city's planning board, of course, and it is responsible for adopting the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2171.591s">So</a>  we'd love to talk to you, you know, any questions or discussion you'd like to have on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2178.313s">And</a>  then just next slide quickly, Annie. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2182.96s">Oh,</a>  did we want to do this now? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2186.963s">I</a>  wasn't sure if you'd have the link in time.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2189.825s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2190.226s">The</a>  only thing that's remaining to be swapped is that order of the chapters and the graphic of the implementation table. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2196.811s">So</a>  Alicia, we might leave it up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2199.693s">If</a>  you think the video is final, it just needs that replacement swap out of the implementation page. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2205.937s">And</a>  that should happen any day now. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2208.286s">We</a>  just have it here in case it would be helpful and we can sort of share it around after the fact as well once we have that updated literacy.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2215.733s">I</a>  think it would be fun to show it. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2217.295s">It's</a>  like two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2219.837s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2220.798s">I</a>  think everyone enjoys a good video.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2223.377s">And</a>  I should say this is from our incredibly talented partner, Landau Designs, who has been working with us on all of the community engagement, the earlier videos that we had, the map that drew so many comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2237.686s">So</a>  with the board's permission, I think we'd love to show it.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2240.668s">Let's</a>  do it.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2243.329s">And</a>  a guest voice.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2245.21s">A</a>  familiar guest voice, yes.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2251.658s">And</a>  then I'll turn it to you after the video to finish up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2254.986s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2255.588s">I</a>  think Annie is just getting the audio set up so audio can share as well.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2259.397s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2266.529s">So</a>  while Annie's doing that, I'll just say that the next steps is this, just because the document is finished, doesn't mean that the work is done from the CD board's perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2278.112s">Obviously</a>  you have the right to, or the obligation to review, and if you're happy with it, to adopt the plan, but it still needs support from everyone who's been involved with the process so far to do the implementation work. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2291.376s">So</a>  there is plenty of time <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2293.477s">for</a>  community comment and participation and engagement.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2315.564s">Can</a>  you hear the sound? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2317.624s">I</a>  believe I'm sharing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2319.065s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2319.425s">Good</a>  job.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2322.344s">Medford's</a>  comprehensive plan is here, and it will act as a roadmap to guide policies and investments over the next 10 to 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2331.946s">It</a>  will help the city plan for future development, adapt to climate change, make it easier to move around, support historic and cultural places, align public services with resident needs, and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2344.429s">It</a>  sets a clear framework with greater predictability and consistency for residents, businesses, city staff, and developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2352.257s">The</a>  plan is structured around five overarching themes that we heard from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2355.98s">Each</a>  chapter of the plan identifies goals, objectives, and actions to support aspirations for the city's future that are easy to measure so that the city can track the plan's progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2366.27s">Here</a>  are a few examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2368.091s">Identify</a>  partners who can help to implement plan recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2372.135s">Provide</a>  communication training to residents and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2375.878s">Adopt</a>  policies for new development to help with climate mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2380.495s">Plant</a>  new trees in priority areas with lower income levels or heat islands. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2385.638s">Make</a>  it easier to walk and bike in Medford by filling gaps in existing networks. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2390.721s">Add</a>  solar arrays or other sustainability features to commercial center parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2395.664s">Rezone</a>  emerging corridors, such as Mystic Avenue and Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2400.967s">Encourage</a>  companies that provide well-paying jobs to residents to locate in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2406.972s">Work</a>  with partners to maintain and grow a range of housing types, focusing on housing affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2413.315s">Build</a>  and strengthen community connections through neighborhood block parties and citywide celebrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2418.997s">For</a>  more examples, take a look at the full plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2422.398s">The</a>  comprehensive plan is a guiding document. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2424.719s">It</a>  will inform future zoning changes and capital projects, but it doesn't directly change any city ordinances or assign funding today. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2432.633s">Future</a>  processes will develop budgets, design capital projects, or revise the city zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2438.976s">Ultimately,</a>  the plan serves as a guide to reach a vision for Medford that by 2050, Medford's many welcoming communities thrive among vibrant places that enhance the daily lives of all who work, play, learn, and grow in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2451.682s">Together,</a>  we share a future that is protected from extreme heat and flooding, connects people to where they need to go, and promotes open, engaged communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2460.426s">The</a>  plan is the result of extensive engagement from you, the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2464.387s">Over</a>  the past year and a half, you've been sharing your ideas with us, your concerns, the places that are special to you, and your vision for the future of your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2472.09s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2473.59s">Your</a>  role doesn't end here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2475.231s">Engagement</a>  will be ongoing as the plan is implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2478.532s">Visit</a>  www.medfordcompplan.org to read the full plan and to stay informed about upcoming opportunities to shape your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2487.767s">have</a>  questions or comments, email compplan at medford-ma.gov.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2512.981s">So</a>  hopefully we've got a couple edits to make to that, as Annie said, just to make it align with all the revisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2519.026s">And</a>  then we hope you'll help us share it around and kind of excessively spread the news about the plan.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2527.676s">That's</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2528.356s">Thank</a>  you very much for the presentation tonight and obviously all of the work you've done it's amazingly impressive to think of the amount of effort that both, or all of the folks involved have put into this the team of consultants advising the city, all the city staff, and maybe most impressive the number of residents who are active participants in this process over a very long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2553.843s">And</a>  so to me, I think that's worthy of congratulations for everyone who's involved in a very impressive feat. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2562.027s">I</a>  thought maybe it would be most appropriate for us to invite any of the members of the steering committee, not that they have to speak tonight, but if there's anyone who's motivated to talk about their experience or their feelings, this would be a great opportunity to hear from each and every one of you who'd like to weigh in tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2585.895s">Amanda,</a>  can you, I'm not sure I'm seeing everyone's hand.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2588.796s">Yeah,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2590.117s">So</a>  I'm happy to have folks, if they, especially from the steering committee, if they want to speak, raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2598.08s">I</a>  see Councilor Rick Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2600.441s">So</a>  I'm going to ask you to unmute.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2606.224s">First</a>  of all, thank you, everybody, for all the work we've done over the months of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2611.006s">So,</a>  you know, it was a lot of time put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2616.563s">and</a>  a lot of work went in. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2618.244s">I</a>  just have a couple of things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2622.485s">There's</a>  no talk about implementation of the plan yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2626.246s">So</a>  I'd like to see how we're gonna implement the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2628.867s">And</a>  then I think at some point, I've said this from day one, we've gotten a lot of community input, but I think it's time now that we start bringing the stakeholders in the community that own the property and everything <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2644.625s">uh,</a>  into the conversation, uh, because again, we know we, everyone can have all the great ideas they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2650.247s">If</a>  the stakeholders don't buy into our project, then we've done all this work for naught. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2655.269s">So</a>  I think, I would hope, I would hope that, um, we could, uh, invite, invite stakeholders in and, and figure out how to implement the plan that we spent so much time on doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2665.892s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2668.453s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2668.793s">Thank</a>  you for that input. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2669.774s">And,</a>  um, it is a good reminder as much effort <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2674.537s">went</a>  into getting us to this point, I feel like there's a lot more ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2680.038s">And</a>  this is only the beginning of the work that's ahead of the boards and residents and city government so thank you for that input do we have others who would like to provide us.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2695.041s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2696.281s">Tom</a>  Lincoln from the steering committee.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2698.761s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2699.101s">Mr.</a>  Lincoln, how are you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2705.282s">No</a>  video.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2718.333s">She</a>  means from the Zoom bombers. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2719.874s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2720.314s">Not</a>  from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2720.955s">Not</a>  from anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2722.817s">We</a>  should have made that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2724.858s">We</a>  had to eject a couple of Zoom bombers.</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2727.44s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2727.981s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2728.361s">But</a>  it's still not on here.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2736.467s">So</a>  what am I going to do?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2737.328s">You</a>  can talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2738.609s">We</a>  don't.</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2739.129s">Oh,</a>  I can talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2739.79s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2740.39s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2741.891s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2742.952s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2743.492s">Forgive</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2744.133s">Tom</a>  Lincoln. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2744.653s">I</a>  usually looking at my ugly mug here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2747.636s">I</a>  think this is terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2749.317s">A</a>  lot of work went has gone into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2751.379s">I</a>  think the key, of course, is, as everybody said, is the implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2756.102s">And</a>  I understand there'll be, you know, a number of steps taken along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2762.387s">I</a>  just had a couple of <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2764.061s">fairly</a>  specific comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2765.382s">I'm</a>  not sure that's exactly the right time to do it, but I did do the trouble of making a little bit of a list here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2770.426s">Alicia's</a>  used to my list. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2773.568s">I</a>  think for the good of all, so to speak, and the good of the plan, I think it'd be really critical to get a couple of things done in a short period. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2785.457s">There</a>  are 181 items in the implementation section, which is really staggering. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2790.908s">And</a>  they're certainly not all on the same level. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2793.208s">But</a>  I think that, and I suggested this to Amanda in an email yesterday or today, you know, maybe picking up, I'm just making up a number here, picking a small number here and doing it because there are a number of things here that really aren't gonna cost any money that would really show some forward progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2810.971s">Sorry,</a>  it's my phone, it only goes off when I'm talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2816.812s">I</a>  also wanted to emphasize that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2821.16s">I'm</a>  going to throw this phone out the window here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2826.482s">Thousands</a>  of spam phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2830.403s">I</a>  think another point that I've made before, and I'm not sure it's reflected here, is I think the city and the planners obviously need to be aware of broader trends. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2841.047s">For</a>  example, there's a lot of talk here about retail and increasing retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2846.735s">I'm</a>  no expert on it, but I'm not sure that bricks and mortar retail is a sector that's going to be prospering in the next 10 years in the American economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2856.141s">I</a>  just was talking to somebody today, was commenting on the number of vacant buildings in our little square here in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2864.367s">So</a>  that's a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2868.05s">The</a>  trees, the tree canopy, the idea of a no net loss tree ordinance, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2876.448s">came</a>  out very strongly in terms of public engagement and public interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2881.25s">And</a>  I think it would be really good to move ahead on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2884.291s">I</a>  think we're kind of falling behind, frankly, on the tree front in Medford, both in terms of the canopy and street trees, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2896.676s">The</a>  last thing I would mention, I think that's critical here as a design review board, this failed politically at least once in my lifetime, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2905.498s">in</a>  the last 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2907.959s">But</a>  I think that there's a lot of sentiment in Medford that development is not well controlled and certainly not aesthetically controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2916.081s">We</a>  talk endlessly in Medford about our historic neighborhoods, et cetera, but we're losing an awful lot of historic fabric. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2924.944s">I'm</a>  not saying it's all worth saving, but once it's gone, it's gone forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2935.346s">The</a>  last thing that there is mentioned on page 41 about an implementation committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2941.511s">I'm</a>  not sure what this is, but I think if you want, as I assume you do, if you want to ensure long-term engagement of residents, that this may be a vehicle you might want to put into effect soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2956.702s">But</a>  as one person on the steering committee and somebody who has way too many opinions, as everybody knows, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2963.189s">I'm</a>  delighted that this has made this much progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2967.451s">I'm</a>  very hopeful that it will move forward to benefit both the people of Medford, to benefit our economy, benefit the environment, and make us a stronger and even more wonderful place. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2981.158s">Thanks</a>  very much.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2983.551s">Thank</a>  you, Tom thanks for weighing in and thank you as always for your engagement with the city and how much you care about that for understand that recognize it so Amanda, I see Councilor Bears with a hand up maybe among others but yes, I'm asking to unmute now.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3005.441s">Great,</a>  thank you so much, Amanda and I'll be short and sweet because I think what I was going to say has been said but <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3011.165s">Number</a>  one, just thankful to everyone who's participated in the process and the staff and all of the consultants who've helped us come to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3018.851s">I</a>  think we can all agree that having a comprehensive plan is long overdue and bringing together all of the work of so many folks, you know, not just over the past year and a half, but also the past, you know, decade or two where we've had plans that didn't go anywhere, but have now maybe had some new life breathed into them by <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3038.763s">I</a>  think, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3039.003s">Pulling</a>  them all together in one place, I think is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3041.345s">Um</a>  but I totally agree that now as as we're looking forward, this plan is designed to help us look forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3048.169s">And</a>  the real question to me is the pace of change, you know, and the pace of action and I think you know, being honest about the level of resources and funding that's going to be necessary to take advantage of the great opportunities that this plan presents. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3061.258s">Um</a>  it's going to be really</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3070.339s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3072.18s">As</a>  the bears, Amanda Do we have other participants, other members of the public who would like to weigh in I was going to go to the board I let us go last if that's okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3084.043s">Oh</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3085.003s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3086.343s">Amanda</a>  Thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3086.884s">I</a>  was just going to thank everyone for the comments so far, Tom and Councilor para bellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3092.258s">and</a>  Councilor Bears, who have all given, we know have read the plan really closely and given it lots of careful thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3098.423s">So</a>  I just wanted to thank them and for the focus on implementation, which has really, I think, been the focus of the team for the last six months with the guidance of this group and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3111.353s">And</a>  I hope, too, with some of Tom's good ideas around low-hanging fruit and kind of implementing some things early, Alicia's team has done a great job looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3121.763s">what's</a>  happening now and kind of what's possible to make happen now and kind of lining up the plan with ongoing initiatives and initiatives that are starting. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3130.209s">So</a>  hopefully there'll be able to be some, some of that demonstrated early action, which is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3136.453s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3138.095s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3138.475s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3138.815s">I</a>  see my neighbor, Rick Orlando with his hand up.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3149.989s">Hello,</a>  neighbor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3152.911s">I'd</a>  like to thank everybody, both those involved from the city and the consultant work and the citizens of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3162.296s">I</a>  would just like to, we hear discussions or questions on implementation frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3169.34s">Implementation</a>  will touch pretty much all of the elements of the plan, the core areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3175.624s">I</a>  think though, in many cases, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3178.025s">the</a>  public, particularly the public that may not have been as active or involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3182.727s">When</a>  they hear that word, they're thinking about development in terms of economic development, downtown development, amenities, buildings, shovels in the ground, that type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3195.994s">That's</a>  done in an intelligent way for the respective areas that development will go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3201.437s">So</a>  I think I just want to <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3204.347s">distinguish</a>  what I think a lot of people are actually inquiring about when they ask about implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3211.33s">And</a>  the last thing I would just echo what Tom said about as we move towards that development, having design guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3217.993s">So</a>  we ended up coming up with something that is attractive and acceptable and well-received by the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3225.256s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3227.958s">Thank</a>  you very much, Rick, for your input and your involvement as always. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3234.35s">Amanda,</a>  can I go to the board now or do we have some other members of the steering committee or public who'd like to weigh in.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3241.293s">Looks</a>  like nobody else has raised their hand or chatted me so yeah, feel free.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3246.735s">Vice</a>  Chair potato. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3248.256s">How</a>  are you this evening.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3250.417s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3250.857s">I'm</a>  pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3251.737s">I</a>  am I actually did raise my hand as a steering committee member I wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3256.216s">I'm</a>  sorry, I don't know if I did it properly here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3258.758s">I</a>  wanted to just make a quick comment before I got into the board discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3263.663s">And</a>  again, just echoing everyone and thanking everyone that took part in this and just first and foremost, congratulations to the city of Medford for getting the ball moving to create and implement this comprehensive plan, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3276.193s">It</a>  expresses the community's values, goals, preferences that align with regulatory requirements as in what we can legally and feasibly be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3284.04s">And,</a>  um, it's represents a healthy, a stealthy collaboration of various community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3290.045s">And</a>  I'm just honored for the opportunity to take part in this inception, including the strategies that we will decide on and figure out to move it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3297.65s">Um,</a>  so I just wanted to just put that out there from the steering committee as a resident, and then I'll circle back as a board member.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3308.738s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3309.719s">Thank</a>  you, Jackie.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3310.9s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3315.955s">All</a>  right, Amanda, should we give it right back to Jackie then she could kick off our board discussion of the comp plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3323.923s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3324.664s">Jackie</a>  if you don't mind taking the honors. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3327.026s">Now</a>  we're in a different hat.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3329.108s">Now</a>  we're in a different hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3331.943s">a</a>  couple of concerns have not so much concerns, but real life action and how we're going to move the action plans forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3339.21s">One</a>  of the questions I had was there was a lot of moving pieces in the implementation section of it, and it's just a matter of having more in-depth conversations with the community, with the city staff, and how we're going to <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3352.662s">get</a>  this out to the community and continued engagement of making sure that it's implemented in a way that actually was captured in the spirit in which it was captured. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3363.073s">So,</a>  and that includes the very real and uncomfortable conversations with elected officials on funding and just making it a huge priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3374.095s">And</a>  so it's really not a question that I have it's just more of a statement that I want to put out there and, and, and I, I have no doubt that this plan could be done, but we really need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3387.161s">We</a>  really did the same energy that was used to make the plan needs to continue and its implementation.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3396.666s">Thank</a>  you, Jackie. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3399.327s">Other</a>  board members with feelings on the plan before us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3411.42s">I</a>  guess just following up on Jackie's thought is that really the first thing that needs to happen is, what is the identifying the first step is it an implementation committee is for various boards and city departments to each identify what their individual first step is in implementation, I'm not sure what, what the answer is to that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3437.636s">If</a>  I may, Mr. Chair, I'd love to throw in a couple of thoughts on the implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3441.74s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3442.54s">Thank</a>  you heard for a few people. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3444.942s">So,</a>  the implementation committee, I think, Tom Lincoln mentioned it is certainly part of this, as is incidentally design review board. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3454.29s">I'd</a>  say that's probably one of the first administrative steps to take in terms of organization, is to figure out how that committee should be set up, who should be on it, get them moving so that they can start to get familiar with the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3472.237s">One</a>  of the other comments was, you know, the physical changes that could come out of this, and that's certainly true. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3478.979s">There</a>  are plenty of <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3481.38s">actions</a>  in here that would result in some sort of physical change, whether it's planting trees, taking care of open space, looking at development, looking at short-term improvement programs to a particular area versus long-term development. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3497.27s">So</a>  thinking about what that low-hanging fruit is is important, but I also want to call out there are things in here that aren't necessarily physical changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3506.135s">And</a>  so that's something that people should be aware of too, that some of the recommendations are about that communication, that bringing people together as Jackie mentioned, that idea that there needs to be a continuing process and back and forth between the city, the residents, the property owners, the business owners, all of the people who are involved with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3527.074s">So</a>  I wanted to call that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3528.975s">And</a>  then finally, Jackie also mentioned financing and I didn't forget to say that in the implementation section there is a list of financial resources programs that can help the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3540.959s">Do</a>  additional planning work with the state to do some infrastructure improvements so there's a whole list of appropriate funding sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3551.943s">Many</a>  of them are grants that are competitive grants but the advantage of having a comprehensive plan <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3558.385s">is</a>  it makes you more competitive when you go after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3561.007s">It</a>  allows the city to put a strong face forward saying we've done our planning, this is how we've engaged the community, this is what the priorities have been, this grant would help us get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3571.592s">So</a>  that's a really important component of implementation to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3575.955s">But</a>  I think from the city's point of view, the entire city, getting that implementation committee up and running <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3582.698s">from</a>  your point of view, the CD board, I think looking at the zoning changes, the links to economic development there, and then understanding the grant cycles and programs and how those would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3594.306s">And</a>  I'll stop now, because I see Alicia has her hand up as well.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3600.69s">Please,</a>  Alicia, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3605.092s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3606.633s">Yes,</a>  this is stuff that we've been thinking about a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3610.215s">Um,</a>  and we've been taking some sort of quiet steps in the background, as some of you are aware, we had, we've had a planner position that's gone on killed for quite a while, that was recently changed to a senior planner position. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3626.055s">and</a>  Danielle was promoted into that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3629.438s">And</a>  part of what she'll do is take on staffing of this board, but part of what was written into that job description was just to work with implementation of the comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3639.808s">And</a>  so some of these steps are things that Danielle will be starting to work with, as I will be as well, and everybody in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3646.855s">But</a>  part of what that makes this possible <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3649.617s">is</a>  that Amanda will then continue to work on a lot of the parks projects that she's been doing and bring more attention to those. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3656.783s">And</a>  then Danielle was actually filling two roles, and we've posted both of those as full-time positions funded through the CPA and CDBG. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3665.83s">So</a>  we're back filling Danielle's work if we can find some good candidates with two people, a housing planner and a CPA manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3675.334s">And</a>  that should really free up her ability to spend some time on some of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3680.016s">Additionally,</a>  I have to apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3681.856s">I</a>  cannot remember in which forums I've mentioned this. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3685.517s">We</a>  have one additional position that we haven't posted yet, but we received a grant from the state for a climate zoning planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3693.762s">And</a>  when we gave them not a description, but a scope of what that person would do, we basically listed all the climate and zoning items that are in the plan, the comprehensive plan and the climate plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3711.316s">And</a>  we said, they're gonna work with the city council and legal and find best practices and help to bring these things forward and help move a bunch of this climate policy forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3722.997s">much</a>  of which is in the comprehensive plan as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3726.399s">So</a>  that's another position that we do expect it'll take us a little bit of time to fill, but that we will also be bringing those resources as well to the table, because a lot of this does take human capital and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3740.125s">And</a>  some of these things are things in the implementation plan <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3745.402s">Each</a>  item, each action is given a project champion, which is a department or department head in the city, who is not necessarily going to personally do it, but would be responsible for moving that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3759.156s">And</a>  in that way we've distributed the work, because this is not one person, it's not one board, it's not even one office. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3765.642s">There</a>  are things in there listed for the city engineer for the traffic department for the DPW for the mayor's office the comms department. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3773.424s">There</a>  is for the health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3775.465s">There's</a>  a lot there under us. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3777.305s">And</a>  a lot of this is actually plans like just for developers for them to understand what is the city looking forward for. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3785.387s">We</a>  were pleased to have one of our big property owners, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3788.528s">Um,</a>  uh, from pre auto lane on the, um, advisory board for this as well as well as one at least one small business owner off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3800.547s">So</a>  and we have reached out and talked with various property owners in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3805.312s">But</a>  part of this is a roadmap for them and developers to understand what is it that the city would like to see moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3812.719s">And</a>  some of it does set the stage for us to know where do we do need to do a little bit more work. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3817.623s">And</a>  where do we need to dig deeper. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3819.806s">So</a>  we do recognize that but we're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3823.575s">We're</a>  ready and if you can help share our job descriptions out and help us find more qualified candidates to share this load with us, that would actually be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3834.222s">So</a>  we thank you all this evening.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3836.184s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3837.985s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3838.785s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3843.616s">I</a>  guess one that I feel like is most relevant to us as a board is the set of zoning considerations that are presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3851.86s">And</a>  we don't always have time to think about those and we only meet kind of these public forums and we do have provisions that we could meet as a subcommittee or we could set up subcommittees, maybe that's something that we need to think about, so that we can roll up our sleeves a little bit and take a look at some of the zoning recommendations and see how they might apply in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3874.83s">So</a>  that's just a thought that's occurring to me now so we're talking through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3879.534s">Some</a>  of the zoning in the past has come from city councils and the zoning has come from, you know, Alicia's office because there have been certain developments or issues that have been raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3889.441s">But</a>  I haven't seen that come from the board itself, maybe this is an opportunity for us to be a little more proactive in an area that is central to our core missions. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3904.01s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3905.091s">Any</a>  other comments we do have the opportunity tonight to vote to adopt the proposed comprehensive plan that's part of our role if we as a board are ready to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3918.929s">If</a>  there's not more discussion we could certainly move to that next step of the motion.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3923.475s">chair</a>  Bloomberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3924.195s">I</a>  just have one more comment I wanted to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3926.576s">I</a>  would be remiss if I didn't say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3928.617s">We</a>  thank everyone, including the city staff and all the residents and everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3932.178s">I</a>  want to just give a special thanks agency for in your partners for all that you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3937.6s">I</a>  was also part of the selection process for that and you didn't disappoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3943.482s">I</a>  just wanted, I just, I had to say that.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3948.695s">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3951.796s">I</a>  just also want to just be explicitly clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3955.818s">There</a>  are two things that are being edited the acknowledgements page, we're still finalizing we just want to make sure that everybody's listed the way they prefer to be listed on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3965.942s">So</a>  we're finalizing the acknowledgements page. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3968.563s">and</a>  we asked the mayor's office if they would write an introduction letter from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3976.266s">And</a>  I did tell them that we did not need that for this evening, because they're working, the mayor's giving a big state of the city next week, and I didn't want to try and compete with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3986.31s">I'd</a>  rather it be them take the time to really give us a good letter.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3992.813s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=3994.575s">My</a>  hope is that that wouldn't hold up your need to vote if you were so inclined to vote on it, though.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=4003.3s">That</a>  sounds fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=4005.541s">Anyone</a>  want to make a motion for approval of the comprehensive plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=4013.245s">Adoption,</a>  I think is the right word.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=4014.826s">Adoption,</a>  so moved, unless you would like me to repeat that.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=4017.367s">I'll</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=4020.169s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=4023.22s">Call</a>  for a roll call vote then sure I have everyone vice chair, Jackie for title.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=4028.602s">Yes.</a> </p>
