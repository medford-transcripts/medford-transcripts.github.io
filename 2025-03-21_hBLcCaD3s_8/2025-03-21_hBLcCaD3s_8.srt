00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:27,480
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're under suspension on the motion of Council tonight to take paper number 15816 to the Honorable President and members of Medford City Council, dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the sum of $250,000 be transferred from sale of real estate to be used for improvements to the five business districts with kiosks as recommended earlier this year.

58
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,942
[SPEAKER_15]: A representative of each business district

59
00:06:30,383 --> 00:06:33,464
[SPEAKER_15]: will recommend to the new mayor some proposed uses.

60
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:44,988
[SPEAKER_15]: I also respectfully request that the sum of $147,687 be returned to the sale of real estate account from snow and ice removal.

61
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:48,610
[SPEAKER_15]: We now anticipate state reimbursement for this purpose.

62
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy New Year, it's been a blast.

63
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:57,233
[SPEAKER_15]: I remain your friend, the Honorable Michael J. McGlynn, mayor, with us this evening.

64
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:07,052
[SPEAKER_15]: is Louise Miller, uh, director of budgeting and finance for the city of Medford, who will explain to us this paper.

65
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:08,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening and welcome.

66
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:09,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

67
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:25,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is a request by the mayor, um, as a result of a commitment that was made to the Medford business groups in the five different business districts for, um, going forward capital improvements to the business districts.

68
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:32,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the first installment of $250,000 is being funded through the sale of real estate account.

69
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:37,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And in years going forward to the extent that funds are available, it will be funded.

70
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:45,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we anticipate with additional revenue, which will be going into the general fund, um, but from parking revenue.

71
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,411
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I may point out that this was at the, uh, request of the city council.

72
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:53,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

73
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:53,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

74
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,301
[SPEAKER_15]: On Madam Vice President.

75
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

76
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:00,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

77
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:03,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Miller, do we have an expected total budget?

78
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:05,004
[SPEAKER_04]: You said the coming year.

79
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this going to be $250,000 a year?

80
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:14,308
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my understanding, is that if the funds are available, that it would be on a $250,000 a year basis.

81
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:17,709
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be part of the operating budget.

82
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,172
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I understood correctly, the new mayor will then

83
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:27,756
[SPEAKER_15]: establish an advisory committee on the disposition of those funds?

84
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:28,897
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

85
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:32,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us some examples maybe of what will be done with the money?

86
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:35,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be used for capital improvements.

87
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:43,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, improvements to the sidewalks, perhaps improvements to lighting, lane markings, you know, anything of that nature.

88
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Trees even?

89
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,372
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to come upon the recommendation of the committee from made up of business men and women.

90
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:55,372
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct.

91
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:55,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

92
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:56,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Spend the money.

93
00:08:56,213 --> 00:09:02,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

94
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,156
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of council caviar for approval.

95
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:04,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I have a second?

96
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:07,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor.

97
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:13,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, Camuso, all those in favor, if I may, if I may, if we could call is requested, uh, required.

98
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize.

99
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam vice president.

100
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:31,380
[SPEAKER_04]: just because it's almost a random $250,000 figure, if we could get an update, um, maybe at year's end every year of what the money's been spent on and how much has been used out of that two 50 versus how much is remaining just so we can have an idea of how to fund it each year.

101
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I just feel like kind of don't know where the two 50 came from.

102
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:44,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So want to make sure that we budgeted correctly each year and are spending it, um, accordingly and the way it should be spent obviously.

103
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:56,901
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the, uh, motion for approval, uh, by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by councilor Camuso as amended by vice president Lungo-Koehn, uh, Councilor Penta.

104
00:09:57,462 --> 00:10:06,368
[SPEAKER_23]: Why couldn't that money be incorporated as part of the office of community development who was desperately in need of folks to have a professional consultant come in as we talked about before?

105
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:16,001
[SPEAKER_23]: just taking $250,000 and spending it randomly at five squares doesn't make as much sense as having a paid professional and here's where the money could come from.

106
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:20,825
[SPEAKER_23]: It would even have to come out of the city's budget and you would have a working operating capital to work with.

107
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:27,049
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, the city is in desperate need of getting good professional people and I think this would be a better way to spend the money.

108
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,091
[SPEAKER_23]: If I would use the money to be spent, that's what I would go because

109
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:35,187
[SPEAKER_23]: You need a professional person who's going to be able to tell you what's wrong, why these squares are not multiplying.

110
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:41,655
[SPEAKER_23]: Just to correct the sidewalk or plant a tree or do a window or put a facade, that doesn't still help the business district.

111
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:48,643
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think what you really need is a hardcore look and a reality check as to why these businesses aren't multiplying or doing as good as they should.

112
00:10:49,275 --> 00:11:03,246
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would like to amend this to go one step further that that money be considered for the purposes of having a paid professional consultant be incorporated into the office of community development for the purposes of business development for the entire five squares in the city of method.

113
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:15,316
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's an amendment by Councilor Penta that a consideration be given to using this money towards the hiring of a business development specialist in the office of community development.

114
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:17,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if I may.

115
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:17,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

116
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:28,260
[SPEAKER_02]: because the money is from the sale of this particular year, the money is from sale of real estate, the money must be used, this initial $250,000 for capital improvement.

117
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Sale of real estate funds cannot be used for a salary.

118
00:11:33,663 --> 00:11:36,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just for this particular year.

119
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:45,830
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, when this first came up, Mr. President, when they were talking about the $250,000 and there wasn't a definition on how this money was going to be spent, there was nothing that required the fact

120
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:47,698
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, you couldn't use it for salaries.

121
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:50,360
[SPEAKER_23]: Now you're putting a requirement on it that wasn't there in the beginning.

122
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:56,465
[SPEAKER_23]: And that right there in and of itself is just, you know, it's, it's stifling the whole idea of moving forward.

123
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:01,970
[SPEAKER_23]: Why can't this money just be put on hold until next year and then incorporate into next year's budget?

124
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:12,599
[SPEAKER_23]: If it's an, if it's an, if you're telling me if it's into the real estate account, why can't it just go into the real estate account and become effective January 1st when the city council, the then city council can make its recommendation.

125
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,991
[SPEAKER_02]: The sale of real estate account can only be used for capital improvements.

126
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:17,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all that I was saying.

127
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:25,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So no matter when those funds are expended, there are currently $470,000, $407,000 in that fund.

128
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:27,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Those funds can only be used for capital.

129
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:29,816
[SPEAKER_23]: But why is it going into the real estate account?

130
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:30,936
[SPEAKER_23]: Why can't it go to free cash?

131
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:36,418
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the way the paper was written by the mayor and is being proposed to you.

132
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,900
[SPEAKER_23]: This is being, where does it say that Louise?

133
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:42,222
[SPEAKER_02]: That what?

134
00:12:42,502 --> 00:12:44,583
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a 250 has to go into the real estate account.

135
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:45,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, right.

136
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:51,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I respectfully request and recommend that the sum of $250,000 be transferred from sale of real estate.

137
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:55,109
[SPEAKER_23]: But that doesn't mean that the council can make a subsequent request to send it to free cash.

138
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,190
[SPEAKER_23]: I would move amend the motion that it'd be sent to free cash.

139
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:02,353
[SPEAKER_23]: That way the, the incoming council can have a better intelligent way of learning how to spend the money.

140
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,357
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have to do as a beep paper because it's contradictory to the main motion.

141
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:10,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

142
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:15,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

143
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,155
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

144
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:22,358
[SPEAKER_18]: Louise, how is, uh, the representative of each business district going to be selected?

145
00:13:23,618 --> 00:13:25,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually do not know that.

146
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:33,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I assume, or I shouldn't assume, but I believe it's going to be the mayor selecting a representative from each of the business districts.

147
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:34,904
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do not know that for sure.

148
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:36,505
[SPEAKER_02]: The new mayor will have to determine that.

149
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,286
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

150
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, with all due respect, I think at this point, I would ask that we lay it on the table.

151
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:54,466
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a lot of unanswered questions on this particular proposal, and I think it warrants more discussion.

152
00:13:55,167 --> 00:14:07,532
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, we may look at having $250,000, a quarter of a million dollars, spent to improve communication between the Chamber of Commerce and the City of Method.

153
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:14,859
[SPEAKER_18]: We may choose to spend the $250,000 to promote small business to come back into our community.

154
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:21,260
[SPEAKER_18]: There may be a number of initiatives rather than saying every business district will get $50,000 and go off and do what they want.

155
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:35,423
[SPEAKER_18]: And maybe it would be worthwhile to, you know, have us as a community look at the larger picture rather than break us into five separate business segments and say, what can we use with a quarter of a million dollars?

156
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,063
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's not just for the first year.

157
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:39,426
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the second, it's the third, and the fourth.

158
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:44,282
[SPEAKER_18]: And by year four, you're talking a million dollars, and this is not chump change.

159
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,411
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, I, I think, uh, we're better off.

160
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:58,397
[SPEAKER_18]: We have an economic development subcommittee that we refer this to the economic development subcommittee, find out who these five representatives are, uh, or maybe there's more than that.

161
00:14:58,937 --> 00:14:59,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, meet with them.

162
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:10,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Let us hear what their needs are because this clearly states to us, it says, uh, the business district will recommend to the new mayor, some proposed uses that doesn't say the mayor is going to implement them.

163
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,284
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't say the mayor is going to act upon them.

164
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:16,078
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't say anything other than they're just going to recommend uses.

165
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:21,100
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, you know, I'd like to see a little more than, uh, what we have in front of us tonight.

166
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,582
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would ask that this be sent to the subcommittee on economic, uh, uh, development.

167
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:27,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

168
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:31,844
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's also, uh, contradictory to the motion that's before us.

169
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:33,985
[SPEAKER_15]: So may we do that as a seat paper?

170
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:40,033
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want, we could do a motion to table.

171
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,736
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't matter to me, but... Are you motioning to table?

172
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:44,577
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do a motion to table.

173
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,660
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Marks to table, all those in favor?

174
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:48,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

175
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:49,222
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

176
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:50,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

177
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:51,844
[SPEAKER_15]: One in opposition.

178
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:53,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

179
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion is tabled.

180
00:15:59,512 --> 00:15:59,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

181
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:00,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Undebatable.

182
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:15,126
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're into suspension, this is a wonderful evening of celebration tonight.

183
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:21,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Two members of the city council will be retiring, leaving the council, and we wish them well.

184
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:29,812
[SPEAKER_15]: They each have many members of their families and friends and longtime supporters with them here tonight to help us in that celebration.

185
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:45,905
[SPEAKER_15]: But as is custom, we'll give, at this time, invite each of the Councilors the opportunity to make a final address on this occasion and to speak to their colleagues and to the people of Medford.

186
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:48,547
[SPEAKER_15]: And then after such presentations,

187
00:16:49,405 --> 00:17:00,554
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, of, uh, speeches on behalf, uh, from both, uh, members will, uh, adjourn, uh, to enjoy some refreshments and presentations of, uh, gifts from the city council.

188
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:08,380
[SPEAKER_15]: So at this time we're going to do you want to do them afterwards or do you want to do them all together?

189
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,123
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

190
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:28,895
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-809 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that Medford City Councilor Robert Penta be recognized for his four decades of public service and dedication to the city of Medford.

191
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:29,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

192
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:46,660
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President, and it's my honor and pleasure to speak on behalf of a colleague I've served with for the past 16 years, someone that I've grown to respect and admire, and someone I got to know outside of

193
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:55,662
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, this reeling and, um, consider, uh, not only a friend, uh, but a close friend.

194
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,922
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is a councilor Bob Penta.

195
00:17:58,883 --> 00:18:09,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, Bob is the longest serving city councilor in this city's history and also the longest serving consecutive city councilor with 18 terms or 36 years.

196
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:15,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, that alone is an accomplishment in this day and age, you know, far too often,

197
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:27,938
[SPEAKER_18]: You hear about people serving public office and within a year or two, you know, something comes up or, you know, their name is besmirched and, you know, things happen.

198
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:34,003
[SPEAKER_18]: And here we have a gentleman that served with distinction for 36 years, the residents of this community.

199
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:43,171
[SPEAKER_18]: And I really find it amazing that someone that's been so vocal in the community and willing to talk on every issue,

200
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:53,310
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, there are times that we'd have tough votes that, you know, we'd discuss ahead of time and say, well, what do you think about this and what do you think about that?

201
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:01,093
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we'd have a crowd of people come up, a crowd of residents, and there may be 150 residents in the audience.

202
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:07,055
[SPEAKER_18]: And surely, Mr. President, you'd see one by one the councilors

203
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:09,788
[SPEAKER_18]: say, well, 150 people here.

204
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:16,113
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to go this way, but now I may go that way, you know, counting the number of votes out there.

205
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:21,658
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can unequivocally state, Mr. President, that that never happened with Bob Penter.

206
00:19:38,606 --> 00:20:01,642
[SPEAKER_18]: There were times when this audience was filled with people, and you can count on Bob standing up, speaking his mind, never swaying on the number of people here, the number of emails, because he was a man of conviction, a man that had principles, a man that felt that he was doing the best on behalf of the community, whether there was five people here or 500 people.

207
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:04,859
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's a trait that you have to admire.

208
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,520
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something that I admire because it's not an easy task.

209
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,782
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the easy thing to look out in the audience and say, there's 100 people here.

210
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,482
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm with them.

211
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:15,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Because as an elected official, you want to be everyone's friend.

212
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:21,466
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's the harder thing, Mr. President, to stand up and stand by your convictions, no matter what the odds are.

213
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:23,246
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is Bob Penta.

214
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:28,228
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, when you look at the years, 36 years, you know, a lot has changed in 36 years.

215
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Jimmy Carter was President when Bob Penta got elected in 1980.

216
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,703
[SPEAKER_18]: A postage stamp was 15 cents when Bob Penta was elected in 1980.

217
00:20:40,664 --> 00:20:44,487
[SPEAKER_18]: And Billy Joel's song on the charts was, It's Still Rock and Roll to Me.

218
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:47,229
[SPEAKER_18]: In 1980.

219
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:50,291
[SPEAKER_18]: So as you can see, a lot has changed over the time.

220
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:56,796
[SPEAKER_18]: And the one thing that has remained constant is Councilor Penta's commitment to this community and the residents of this community.

221
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:59,679
[SPEAKER_18]: That has never wavered in 36 years.

222
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,781
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Bob fought for transparency.

223
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:15,675
[SPEAKER_18]: He fought for fiscal responsibility, a common sense approach to city government, and never, as I mentioned, never changed his vote no matter what the odds were or what the issue was.

224
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:21,477
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob was always true to himself and always represented the people in that manner, Mr. President.

225
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:24,899
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob served for many years on a lot of different boards.

226
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:31,241
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd be here all night if we went through every one of Councilor Penta's accomplishments, but just to name a few,

227
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:35,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob was a member of the Community Advisory Board for the New England Memorial Hospital.

228
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:39,036
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob served on the Board of Directors for the West Medford Community Center.

229
00:21:39,376 --> 00:21:40,356
[SPEAKER_18]: It still does currently.

230
00:21:41,037 --> 00:21:43,957
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob serves on the Board of the Brooks Estates.

231
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:46,758
[SPEAKER_18]: He's one of the Board of Directors for the Brooks Estates Land Trust.

232
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:54,440
[SPEAKER_18]: He is a member of the Mass Municipal Association Board of Director and past member of the Public Employee Policy Environmental Committees.

233
00:21:56,081 --> 00:22:01,122
[SPEAKER_18]: Over the years, there's been a number of issues in the community, and I can tell you firsthand,

234
00:22:01,846 --> 00:22:11,558
[SPEAKER_18]: When the parking program came up, and there were a lot of people pro and con on the parking issue, it was one person that went to every one of the five business districts.

235
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:20,184
[SPEAKER_18]: One person that went into the business, no matter what size you were, no matter what your business was, and asked, how is this impact your business?

236
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:21,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this going to be good or bad?

237
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:23,066
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was Bob Penta.

238
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:25,467
[SPEAKER_18]: No one else went around to every business district.

239
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:29,389
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm going to speak for every one of the councils, because I didn't hear anyone else going around.

240
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:31,751
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob Penta went to every business district.

241
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:36,433
[SPEAKER_18]: He didn't have to do that after 34 years on the city council, being the senior member.

242
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:41,696
[SPEAKER_18]: He did it because it was the right thing to do, and he wanted to be in touch with the small businesses in this

243
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:45,940
[SPEAKER_18]: community to see how this parking program would impact business.

244
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,663
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, that took a lot of time and effort and things that don't go noticed.

245
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,044
[SPEAKER_18]: That wasn't on the front page of the transcript.

246
00:22:54,905 --> 00:23:00,688
[SPEAKER_18]: That wasn't in every post that you read and on social media.

247
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:08,091
[SPEAKER_18]: But that was something Bob did to be in tune 36 years or 34 years after getting elected.

248
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:11,293
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that speaks volumes for his character, Mr. President.

249
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:21,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, Mr. President, Bob Pinto was one of the first to offer a line item in our budget.

250
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:24,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Never happened before in this city's history for the arts.

251
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:38,774
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob realized the importance of having a strong art community in this city, and Bob witnessed firsthand what the arts can do with their own minimal money, let alone having money put aside in the city budget.

252
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:43,237
[SPEAKER_18]: There are thousands of people that get impacted in our community from the arts.

253
00:23:43,803 --> 00:23:48,326
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was Bob Penta's resolution to speak up for the arts in this community.

254
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:53,369
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know many of the artists will always be beholden to Bob because of that.

255
00:23:53,909 --> 00:24:03,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob was the first elected official when we had the embattled Medford Housing Authority with their executive director come under a lot of controversy a few years ago.

256
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:08,558
[SPEAKER_18]: And many people didn't want to talk about it because, you know, it's just an issue we didn't want to touch.

257
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,400
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob Penta was the first elected official

258
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:13,814
[SPEAKER_18]: to stand up and say, something's wrong.

259
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:16,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Something's wrong with this housing authority.

260
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:17,355
[SPEAKER_18]: More is going to come out.

261
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:22,477
[SPEAKER_18]: And eventually more did come out, but that Bob had his ear to the grind constantly.

262
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:26,418
[SPEAKER_18]: He had his finger on the pulse of this city and he wasn't afraid to speak up.

263
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:34,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, you know, Bob was the first, uh, elected official to stand up, uh, with the potential merger with partners and Lawrence Memorial hospital.

264
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:36,122
[SPEAKER_18]: He was the first to put it on the agenda.

265
00:24:36,782 --> 00:24:40,285
[SPEAKER_18]: He put it on the agenda 25 times, but he was the first to put it on the agenda.

266
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:42,106
[SPEAKER_18]: And he kept it out there.

267
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:45,108
[SPEAKER_18]: He kept the issue going so people knew what was going on.

268
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:48,291
[SPEAKER_18]: People that worked for the hospital knew what was happening.

269
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:59,600
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, I give him a lot of kudos for being the first on these very important issues, not only to bring them up, but to make people in the community aware of what's going on in our city.

270
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,381
[SPEAKER_18]: The clean up and fix up week.

271
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:05,164
[SPEAKER_18]: It still hasn't happened, and I hope under the new administration,

272
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:09,166
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an issue that Bob Penter has brought up for several years now.

273
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:14,147
[SPEAKER_18]: And think about it, with the new trash program, you have to be very selective what you put out on the curb now.

274
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:24,870
[SPEAKER_18]: And Bob devised a program that you can put out once a year, whatever you want, and the trucks will come by and pick up your sofa, your bureau, whatever it is out there.

275
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:31,412
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just think that's an ingenious way of getting people maybe that want to clean out a cellar or an attic or

276
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:42,077
[SPEAKER_18]: have the kid coming back from college, and I want to make some room to allow residents to toss out more stuff on the sidewalk without calling.

277
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:45,699
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob Penta called for charter review 10 years ago.

278
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:47,860
[SPEAKER_18]: There was no discussion 10 years ago.

279
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Now there's a lot of discussion about charter review because our charter hasn't been reviewed in 28 years.

280
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,584
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's a lot of discussion now, and I think many elected officials are on board now.

281
00:25:57,904 --> 00:26:01,226
[SPEAKER_18]: But it was 10 years ago that Bob was calling for charter review.

282
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:06,065
[SPEAKER_18]: and to take a look at the city charter, which is the master plan on how this city operates.

283
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:09,267
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was Bob's vision 10 years ago.

284
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:12,509
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, public access.

285
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:15,350
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been without public access for several years now.

286
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:19,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob Penter has been the champion to bring back public access in this community.

287
00:26:20,193 --> 00:26:22,515
[SPEAKER_18]: Not for Bob Penter, not for this council.

288
00:26:22,535 --> 00:26:23,695
[SPEAKER_18]: We're on Tuesday nights.

289
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:29,579
[SPEAKER_18]: For the people in this community, local programming that we used to have in this community, which is very important,

290
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:37,818
[SPEAKER_18]: to the success of this community and to the well-being of our sports programs and arts and culture in this city.

291
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:44,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob Penter has realized that for years and has been an advocate and a champion for public access in this community.

292
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:57,292
[SPEAKER_18]: The Courtyard Nursing Home, when neighbors got up in arms because they leveled all the mature trees in the back of the Courtyard Nursing Home, Bob Penter stood aside all the neighbors and said, what are you doing here?

293
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:08,775
[SPEAKER_18]: And he forced the hand of the nursing home to plant mature trees to act as a buffer, like it was originally, between the neighborhood and the back of the courtyard nursing home.

294
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:14,278
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was Bob Penta that stood up on behalf of the residents of this community.

295
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:22,595
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, I'm proud to say these comments about my friend, Bob Penta.

296
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:24,517
[SPEAKER_18]: He will be sorely missed.

297
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:29,921
[SPEAKER_18]: I know I'm not the only one that's going to miss him, but he will be sorely missed.

298
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:36,066
[SPEAKER_18]: And my wife will be happy because I'll be getting home an hour earlier now on Tuesday nights.

299
00:27:37,387 --> 00:27:40,290
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll be home in a reasonable time.

300
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,933
[SPEAKER_18]: But honestly, I hope to see

301
00:27:44,848 --> 00:27:46,088
[SPEAKER_18]: you around, Councilor Penta.

302
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:47,829
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope to see you stay active.

303
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:52,870
[SPEAKER_18]: You have such a knowledge that we as a community need to tap and stay involved.

304
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:56,271
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've always envied your record keeping.

305
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,972
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you would pull out resolutions from 1983.

306
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:03,934
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't find the resolution from last week.

307
00:28:05,234 --> 00:28:06,754
[SPEAKER_18]: And you would have a catalog.

308
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:10,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Susan, your house must be like the CIA.

309
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:12,076
[SPEAKER_18]: You must have a file on each

310
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:14,027
[SPEAKER_18]: It's amazing.

311
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:25,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Over the years, the information that you're able to obtain and access through your cataloging and due diligence, I think, is just another part on how you treated the job.

312
00:28:25,474 --> 00:28:28,656
[SPEAKER_18]: This wasn't just a side job that Bob Penta did on the side.

313
00:28:28,996 --> 00:28:33,819
[SPEAKER_18]: This was Bob Penta's full-time job, and he treated it like a full-time job.

314
00:28:37,696 --> 00:29:02,034
[SPEAKER_18]: know there's a number of residents here that would like to present Councilor Penta, in addition to what we as a council are presenting, Mr. President, there are a number of residents that would like to present Councilor Penta with the gift for his 36 years of dedicated service as a public servant to the residents and to the city of Medford.

315
00:29:02,354 --> 00:29:07,498
[SPEAKER_18]: So at this time, I would ask that the residents come up with the gift that they have, Mr. President,

316
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:09,179
[SPEAKER_18]: and present it to Councilor Penta.

317
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:30,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street.

318
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:35,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks and through the chair, there were a few people, several people,

319
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:39,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to say a few words before we make the presentation.

320
00:29:39,534 --> 00:29:44,136
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured it would be better, uh, to do that first, if that's okay and agreeable with you.

321
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:53,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, don't want to make this, you know, um, too long, but, uh, I'd like to give them the opportunity to speak first and then I'll come commence with the gifts.

322
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

323
00:29:59,283 --> 00:29:59,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

324
00:29:59,843 --> 00:30:00,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

325
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:01,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Address for the record.

326
00:30:01,484 --> 00:30:04,625
[SPEAKER_19]: I form a student president of the council for Dello Russo.

327
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:05,844
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Griffin.

328
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:07,084
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Jay Griffin.

329
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:09,486
[SPEAKER_19]: I live at 8 Arbor Glen Lane in Methuen.

330
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:16,232
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to congratulate Councilor Camuso, another former student, on his service to the city.

331
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:25,079
[SPEAKER_19]: But in particular, I want to address my remarks to the citizens of Medford and to one of my closest friends, Councilor Penta.

332
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,704
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to take a few minutes of your time to reflect on my thoughts about Boab.

333
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:36,883
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob Penta speaks his mind, as Councilor Mark said.

334
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,225
[SPEAKER_19]: He doesn't sugarcoat anything.

335
00:30:40,265 --> 00:30:43,127
[SPEAKER_19]: His speech doesn't pander to any group.

336
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:45,608
[SPEAKER_19]: He says what he feels.

337
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:52,993
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Penta has been an outspoken champion of preserving Medford's proud history.

338
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:57,816
[SPEAKER_19]: Without his support, there would be no Brooks Estate.

339
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:01,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Penta served with me on the executive board

340
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:04,568
[SPEAKER_19]: of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust.

341
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:10,571
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob raised money and promoted the estate every chance that he had.

342
00:31:12,052 --> 00:31:22,837
[SPEAKER_19]: The carriage house would not be in such a terrible state of disrepair today if the city had supported the reuse plan that he had pushed before.

343
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:29,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob Penta also served on the executive board of the Medford Historical Society with me.

344
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:37,867
[SPEAKER_19]: He was always the first to volunteer when we had special events, exhibits, and tours.

345
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:53,419
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Penta made sure that the city funded the restoration of the Historical Societies Museum on Governors Avenue and the preservation of the Craddock or Peter Tufts House at 350 Riverside Avenue.

346
00:31:54,607 --> 00:32:02,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Many years ago, I came before the Medford City Council to address problems that were taking place in Royal House Park.

347
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:07,851
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually brought a brick from the wall and slammed it down here.

348
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,912
[SPEAKER_19]: We had kids in the park drinking.

349
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:12,413
[SPEAKER_19]: I found hypodermic needles.

350
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:14,393
[SPEAKER_19]: There was no lighting.

351
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:15,654
[SPEAKER_19]: The wall was too high.

352
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:16,594
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody could hide.

353
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:31,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob worked with Bill Slagle, and between the Royal House Association and the City of Medford, we spent $40,000 to put the new wall around Royal House Park.

354
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,916
[SPEAKER_19]: At present, there is no lighting.

355
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:38,157
[SPEAKER_19]: I just drove by just to be sure.

356
00:32:38,877 --> 00:32:39,938
[SPEAKER_19]: There were two lights there.

357
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:48,022
[SPEAKER_19]: He had three lights put in, two that illuminated the park and one that would shine on the house.

358
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:52,465
[SPEAKER_19]: As you go home tonight, Fred, look, it is pitch black.

359
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:54,786
[SPEAKER_19]: You're waiting for trouble to happen.

360
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:59,930
[SPEAKER_19]: The fence between the park and the house has been destroyed.

361
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,712
[SPEAKER_19]: There's big holes in it because the beech tree came down.

362
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:06,014
[SPEAKER_19]: So now this is in this city council's hands.

363
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:08,836
[SPEAKER_19]: I can see

364
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:23,886
[SPEAKER_19]: In the future, if you don't put some kind of lighting in there, you're going to lose one of the premier national historic sites in the state of Massachusetts and in the United States of America.

365
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:26,988
[SPEAKER_19]: It's classified as one of the top 20 in our state.

366
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:35,993
[SPEAKER_19]: I cannot believe that we can't put in green LED lighting and illuminate that whole area.

367
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:39,055
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a plus for the city of Medford.

368
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,832
[SPEAKER_19]: The city of Medford has three historic homes open to the public.

369
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:48,195
[SPEAKER_19]: The Craddock House, built in the 1600s.

370
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:51,677
[SPEAKER_19]: The Royal House and Slave Quarters, built in the 1700s.

371
00:33:51,777 --> 00:33:56,760
[SPEAKER_19]: The Shepherd Brooks Manor, built in the 1800s.

372
00:33:58,321 --> 00:34:06,347
[SPEAKER_19]: Any other city would support the efforts to preserve and highlight 300 years of outstanding architecture.

373
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:19,858
[SPEAKER_19]: These houses, if preserved, would draw tourists who would eat in Medford restaurants, shop in Medford stores, and this is something that Bob has championed his whole time on the council.

374
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:26,439
[SPEAKER_19]: He's always been a leader, not just giving speeches when the chamber's full like it is tonight.

375
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:37,162
[SPEAKER_19]: He has spent countless hours on many executive boards, at many meetings, trying to preserve Medford's long and rich heritage.

376
00:34:38,824 --> 00:34:45,570
[SPEAKER_19]: At this time, I'd like to ask God to bless Bob and Susan as they begin the next chapter of their lives.

377
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:51,775
[SPEAKER_19]: And I dropped the gauntlet down to the current city council administration to correct these inequities.

378
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:52,675
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

379
00:34:53,596 --> 00:34:54,377
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

380
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:04,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

381
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:05,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

382
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:08,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Ray Scaffo, ninth sunset Avenue in Medford.

383
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:15,119
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to take a couple of seconds to thank Paul Camuso for the time that he served on the council and I wish you well Paul.

384
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, good evening tonight.

385
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:22,863
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to, I would like to talk to you about my friend Bob Penta.

386
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:29,667
[SPEAKER_20]: This, this is Bob's last city council meeting after over 30 years of service to the citizens of Medford.

387
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:37,052
[SPEAKER_20]: The people of Medford could not have had a more honest, dedicated and passionate council.

388
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:44,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Bob always believed his first obligation as an elected Councilor was to the people of the city of Medford.

389
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:53,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Bob's passion for Medford is evident to anyone who knows him or whom he worked with him.

390
00:35:54,596 --> 00:36:00,978
[SPEAKER_20]: Some people have mistaken his passion as a liability, calling him argumentative or outright mean.

391
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:05,560
[SPEAKER_20]: However, this liability is his greatest asset.

392
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,880
[SPEAKER_20]: Bob always

393
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:12,854
[SPEAKER_20]: directed his passion towards making sure the citizens of Medford were being treated fairly.

394
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:20,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Bob's passion was often demonstrated in his willingness to ask why.

395
00:36:21,235 --> 00:36:24,916
[SPEAKER_20]: Why are our property taxes rising without a substantiated budget?

396
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:30,637
[SPEAKER_20]: Why are our water bills rising when there is more than $7 million in the city's water account?

397
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:36,598
[SPEAKER_20]: Why have citizens of Medford been charged $3.25 per month and now up to $5

398
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:41,661
[SPEAKER_20]: for local access TV that has not existed for over two years.

399
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:51,425
[SPEAKER_20]: Why are these costs going up when there's another $325,000 available in the city coffers with all this surplus?

400
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:56,187
[SPEAKER_20]: Why is our infrastructure failing and falling into this repair?

401
00:36:57,367 --> 00:37:05,751
[SPEAKER_20]: Why does the city need a charter review so that you, the city council can have better checks and balances.

402
00:37:07,717 --> 00:37:17,903
[SPEAKER_20]: There are over 6,500 voters in Medford who, like Bob, want to know why they are passionate about this city and sad to see him leave the council.

403
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:27,909
[SPEAKER_20]: They know, like I do, that Bob always fighting for them in the betterment of the city of Medford and hope that he will not go away.

404
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:35,433
[SPEAKER_20]: Bob's passion has inspired a group of citizens, including me, to fight for the good of our city.

405
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:42,864
[SPEAKER_20]: When the call comes to fight, all 6,500 and more will be there to fight again.

406
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:56,419
[SPEAKER_20]: On behalf of all his supporters, I want to express my thanks to my friend and his greatest strength, his wife Susan, for their dedication and service to all the people of Mexico.

407
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome, please state your name and address for the record.

408
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street.

409
00:38:18,054 --> 00:38:19,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Penta, Bob.

410
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:26,640
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank you for your devotion in representing all of the residents of Medford.

411
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:36,807
[SPEAKER_17]: You are our advocate on the city council and you fought with passion to achieve the best outcomes for all of the residents of Medford.

412
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:38,588
[SPEAKER_17]: With grit,

413
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:49,237
[SPEAKER_17]: and determination, you communicated the frustration of so many of us as our voices and concerns fell on deaf ears or were ignored time and time again.

414
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:59,720
[SPEAKER_17]: I personally want to thank you for standing with me, my family, and my friend and neighbor, God rest her soul, on a particular issue.

415
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:07,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Because of you, my neighbor felt vindicated and realized that someone actually listened to her point of view.

416
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:10,938
[SPEAKER_17]: understood it, and pushed back the bullies.

417
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:15,622
[SPEAKER_17]: You endured unwarranted backlash for your efforts.

418
00:39:17,183 --> 00:39:22,428
[SPEAKER_17]: But what you did will never be forgotten by me, and I will be forever grateful to you.

419
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:37,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Harry Truman, a Democrat, and you're a Republican, in case anyone missed it the last time, said, fame is a vapor, popularity

420
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:39,105
[SPEAKER_17]: is an accident.

421
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:40,646
[SPEAKER_17]: Riches take wing.

422
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:44,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Those who cheer today may curse tomorrow.

423
00:39:45,428 --> 00:39:48,169
[SPEAKER_17]: And only one thing endures, character.

424
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Your character endures, as does your love for this city.

425
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:55,152
[SPEAKER_17]: God bless you and Susan.

426
00:39:55,713 --> 00:39:56,253
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

427
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,514
[SPEAKER_17]: It's so long, not goodbye.

428
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:17,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, City Council, Council President Del Russo, for being allowed to speak here this evening.

429
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:20,818
[SPEAKER_09]: My sentiments also to Councilor Camuso.

430
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,039
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a few nice battles, but we always walked away smiling.

431
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a few words I'd like to say.

432
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,341
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to do this in a different approach.

433
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:36,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two quotes here I'd like to read.

434
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:41,702
[SPEAKER_09]: First one, be more concerned with your character

435
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:49,909
[SPEAKER_09]: than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.

436
00:40:50,509 --> 00:41:03,051
[SPEAKER_09]: That's from John Wooden, who was one of the most winningest coaches in college basketball, who won 10 championships in a 12-year reign with an unprecedented seven in a row, seven consecutive wins.

437
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:10,053
[SPEAKER_09]: The second quote, I believe there's an inner power that makes winners or losers.

438
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:14,070
[SPEAKER_09]: And the winners are the ones who really listen to the truth of their hearts.

439
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:20,754
[SPEAKER_09]: That's from Sylvester Stallone, otherwise known as Yo Rocky, okay?

440
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:22,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, why these two?

441
00:41:23,956 --> 00:41:31,060
[SPEAKER_09]: One is a fictional character portrayed by an actor, and the other was an actual human portrayed by a human, okay?

442
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,601
[SPEAKER_09]: But what did they have?

443
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:35,903
[SPEAKER_09]: They not only taught the talk, they walked the walk.

444
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:38,606
[SPEAKER_09]: They did so with compassion.

445
00:41:39,386 --> 00:41:41,506
[SPEAKER_09]: They did so with integrity.

446
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:46,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were determined to have things go the right way.

447
00:41:46,448 --> 00:41:48,209
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was always for the other person.

448
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:49,929
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't for themselves solely.

449
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what Bobby Penter is.

450
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,991
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew Bobby Penter back in the days of driving canteen trucks.

451
00:41:57,632 --> 00:42:00,993
[SPEAKER_09]: He gave most of the food away to the needy kids in Roxbury and Dorchester.

452
00:42:01,013 --> 00:42:01,973
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people don't know that.

453
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,113
[SPEAKER_09]: He was always being yelled at for not being able to pay his bill because he was giving the food away to the hungry people.

454
00:42:07,774 --> 00:42:13,738
[SPEAKER_09]: But he's always been, no matter what, no matter what kind of adversity there was, he stood up.

455
00:42:13,918 --> 00:42:17,381
[SPEAKER_09]: He stood up for what he believed in and what he felt the people wanted him to believe in.

456
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:21,044
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that, there's a lot of baggage that comes with that.

457
00:42:21,845 --> 00:42:29,450
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people don't understand, but he has conviction, he has integrity, and he's been a really good friend to me.

458
00:42:30,111 --> 00:42:31,512
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope he feels the same way.

459
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:33,288
[SPEAKER_09]: about me to him.

460
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:36,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, that's all I have to say in that regard.

461
00:42:36,912 --> 00:42:45,300
[SPEAKER_09]: What I would like to do right now is I'd like to give Mrs. Penta, Susan, the backbone of Mr. Bobby Penta.

462
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to present her with something.

463
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:47,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you?

464
00:42:47,342 --> 00:42:47,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Come here.

465
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:37,304
[SPEAKER_09]: She earned those roses, let me tell you.

466
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:47,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we know you worked very hard during the campaign this past year.

467
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:57,168
[SPEAKER_09]: And your supporters and your friends felt that the two of you deserve something to show our appreciation for your efforts.

468
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:04,810
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first thing I have is a gift certificate for a lovely meal for the two of you.

469
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:09,864
[SPEAKER_09]: to a place called Il Posto in Somerville.

470
00:44:10,685 --> 00:44:13,447
[SPEAKER_09]: So the two of you can go and enjoy a nice meal.

471
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:22,714
[SPEAKER_09]: To start your new year off, a bottle of Dom Perignon.

472
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:34,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And we hope that is just the beginning of a new life for you and Susan.

473
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:39,812
[SPEAKER_09]: And for Councilor Penta, we have a special gift for you.

474
00:44:40,713 --> 00:44:53,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be okay if Councilor Penta could come over to the podium, please?

475
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:04,245
[SPEAKER_09]: What we have here is a 1904 edition of the City of Medford on parchment paper that's framed

476
00:45:04,813 --> 00:45:10,395
[SPEAKER_09]: The inscription says, Robert M. Penta, thank you from the citizens of Medford.

477
00:45:55,691 --> 00:45:56,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everybody.

478
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:05,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Susan Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

479
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:15,421
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I want to thank everyone on the council for all your support of Bob.

480
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:18,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a crazy year.

481
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:25,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking forward to some time off just to relax a little bit and find ourselves again.

482
00:46:25,544 --> 00:46:34,791
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've said it before and I'll say it one more time, Bob Penta, I love you.

483
00:46:35,832 --> 00:46:41,636
[SPEAKER_01]: You are an amazing man and I'm proud of what we did and how we did it.

484
00:46:42,737 --> 00:46:49,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm saying it publicly now because you are an amazing person and I believe that you

485
00:46:52,275 --> 00:46:55,198
[SPEAKER_01]: love this city more than anything else.

486
00:46:55,258 --> 00:46:56,039
[SPEAKER_01]: You really do.

487
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,667
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell people all the time, it reminds me of the song, you don't know what you got till it's gone.

488
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:07,092
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that people will notice when you're gone.

489
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't go too far.

490
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:10,035
OK?

491
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:11,516
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.

492
00:47:29,924 --> 00:47:32,204
[SPEAKER_15]: I know some of the councilors want to speak.

493
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:33,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

494
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:35,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

495
00:47:35,245 --> 00:47:43,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing forward all of Councilor Penta's accolades and the things he's done over his 36 years.

496
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:50,548
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've only had a short period of time to work with Councilor Penta, four years, and I've learned a lot from him.

497
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:57,530
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in my last four years, I've got to work with two great leaders here and behind the rail, and I've learned for both of them.

498
00:47:59,448 --> 00:48:13,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I first worked with Bob Pinter maybe about 20 years ago when the mayor asked the Chamber of Commerce to start changing the current liquor laws.

499
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:16,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bob Pinter was one of the first people we worked with.

500
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:18,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the first time I got to work with him.

501
00:48:18,951 --> 00:48:23,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was very helpful and supportive during those years.

502
00:48:23,172 --> 00:48:26,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, the laws have changed.

503
00:48:27,213 --> 00:48:29,073
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of restaurants, and we were very successful.

504
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:33,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's in good part due to Bob Penta and his hard work.

505
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:37,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I'm very proud to serve with him in my last four years here.

506
00:48:38,422 --> 00:48:44,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, there's not a man that has convictions that would never move.

507
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:48,951
[SPEAKER_03]: If Bob Penta was on your side, he'd stay with you till the end.

508
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:55,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I want to thank him for his 36 years of service and I'm glad to be your friend.

509
00:49:05,123 --> 00:49:06,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

510
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:12,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to keep everybody from their cake, but — and everybody did such a great job talking about Councilor Penter.

511
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:15,030
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to say a few words.

512
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:19,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you, Bob, for your many years of dedicated service.

513
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,595
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been servants since before I was born.

514
00:49:21,615 --> 00:49:27,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you for —

515
00:49:36,953 --> 00:49:40,756
[SPEAKER_04]: With that being said, I guess I've learned from the best.

516
00:49:41,457 --> 00:49:44,079
[SPEAKER_04]: You've taught me many, many lessons.

517
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:49,403
[SPEAKER_04]: You've taught me to stand up for what I believe in, because you always stand up for what you believe in.

518
00:49:50,664 --> 00:49:54,568
[SPEAKER_04]: You've taught me to ask questions and do my homework.

519
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:59,291
[SPEAKER_04]: God knows, as it was said before, your library at home is quite large.

520
00:50:02,758 --> 00:50:05,339
[SPEAKER_04]: You have kept the administration on their toes.

521
00:50:05,479 --> 00:50:11,600
[SPEAKER_04]: You've asked questions that all of us, you know, want to ask.

522
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:19,522
[SPEAKER_04]: You ask questions that the taxpayers need us to ask, and you've taught me to do that, and I so greatly appreciate that.

523
00:50:20,322 --> 00:50:21,923
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been a true role model.

524
00:50:23,883 --> 00:50:31,745
[SPEAKER_04]: You've put politics and family first, which is something that I obviously family first, but you put the city of Medford before

525
00:50:32,787 --> 00:50:38,411
[SPEAKER_04]: anything else, which is extremely important in the position that you have held for so long.

526
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:43,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that one day I can be half of the Councilor that you are.

527
00:50:44,915 --> 00:50:53,600
[SPEAKER_04]: When election night came out and it was past 8 o'clock, somebody brought a bottle of champagne to my house and I said, I can't drink it.

528
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:59,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I had this emotion of seriously just feeling like

529
00:51:00,504 --> 00:51:02,525
[SPEAKER_04]: the council will almost be empty without you.

530
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:16,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally realized that you weren't gonna be here come January 1st and that's a big set of shoes to fill and we will do our best, I'm sure, but it will never be the same.

531
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:26,276
[SPEAKER_04]: You've taught me so much and I really appreciate all you've done for the city and I hope you stick around and I'm sure you'll keep your voice heard and be fighting for the people even during your retirement.

532
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:30,078
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do hope you enjoy your trips to Florida and have some

533
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,201
[SPEAKER_04]: fun with your grandchildren and your lovely wife.

534
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:49,529
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be missed, and just thank you for all your years of service.

535
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:51,049
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

536
00:51:54,535 --> 00:51:54,875
[SPEAKER_15]: What can I say?

537
00:51:54,895 --> 00:52:05,480
[SPEAKER_15]: You also have a motion here, be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Robert M. Penter on being the longest serving City Council member in Medford history.

538
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,280
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

539
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:12,943
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I don't even know where to begin, you know, uh, 36 years.

540
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:20,446
[SPEAKER_21]: I was two years older than Councilor Lungo, you know, and, uh, absolutely.

541
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:21,967
[SPEAKER_21]: And, um,

542
00:52:23,745 --> 00:52:24,986
[SPEAKER_21]: For the first time, I'm speechless.

543
00:52:25,026 --> 00:52:29,848
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, Bob, you're really a fellow that's kept me young over the years.

544
00:52:29,908 --> 00:52:33,811
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes you'd think that we were two kids getting ready to fight at Playstead Park.

545
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:38,954
[SPEAKER_21]: But in reality, we were both just fighting for what we really believed in.

546
00:52:39,454 --> 00:52:41,055
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's something that I admire about you.

547
00:52:43,816 --> 00:52:45,917
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going out this evening, retiring as well.

548
00:52:46,698 --> 00:52:49,700
[SPEAKER_21]: And the council's not going to be the same without you.

549
00:52:51,673 --> 00:53:01,518
[SPEAKER_21]: I respect your loyalty, your tenacious ability to fight for what you believe in, and you've certainly been passionate over your tenure on the council.

550
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:15,546
[SPEAKER_21]: One thing that I really admired about you, and I was going through a similar situation at the time with my dad, was when you cared for your lovely wife, Linda, and I saw a side of you that most people didn't see.

551
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:21,550
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, I'm just talking about my dad, I get a little emotional.

552
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,071
[SPEAKER_21]: But you really are a good-hearted guy, you know?

553
00:53:26,151 --> 00:53:35,034
[SPEAKER_21]: At the end of the day, and the good part about it was, I'd see you at Bocelli's or something, after a meeting, you'd still tell me how much I stink, but we could laugh about it, you know?

554
00:53:38,695 --> 00:53:48,138
[SPEAKER_21]: But, like I said, I'm going out tonight, we're both going out as winners, we both won by fighting for the people of Medford,

555
00:53:50,759 --> 00:54:06,351
[SPEAKER_21]: didn't want to make it sound, I'm in good company of leaving this room tonight with another councillor that I know left his best battle on the field and you fought for what you believed in and for that you should be very proud.

556
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:17,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

557
00:54:18,074 --> 00:54:20,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very, very much.

558
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:22,236
[SPEAKER_11]: But more importantly, Councilor Penta, thank you.

559
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:29,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I think everybody behind the reels has been involved in government for a good portion of their professional career.

560
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,879
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've all had interactions with Bob Penta.

561
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:42,803
[SPEAKER_11]: And one thing I can say about you, Councilor, is I'm certainly very disappointed that I don't have an opportunity to work alongside you for more of a tenure than I have.

562
00:54:42,983 --> 00:54:46,604
[SPEAKER_11]: I think everybody behind this reel has had an opportunity to work with you a little bit more than I have.

563
00:54:47,211 --> 00:54:53,564
[SPEAKER_11]: And one thing that I've really been able to take away from working with you, Councilor, is that it's about the issues.

564
00:54:54,266 --> 00:54:55,689
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not about personalities.

565
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:56,290
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not about

566
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:10,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Winning or losing it's about the issues and it's about doing what's right for the people in Medford and you and I could maybe not get along on one issue and When that issue is over and the votes taken two seconds later something else is on the table It needs to be addressed and what's over is over.

567
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:11,574
[SPEAKER_11]: What's done is done.

568
00:55:11,914 --> 00:55:17,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's work on the next thing Councilor So I certainly appreciate the way that you can leave it behind the rail, but it's not about personalities.

569
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:19,761
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about it's about people It's about the city of Medford.

570
00:55:19,781 --> 00:55:21,483
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about moving Medford forward Councilor

571
00:55:22,548 --> 00:55:26,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Another thing I'd like to congratulate you on is what a hell of a campaign you were in.

572
00:55:37,092 --> 00:55:39,093
[SPEAKER_11]: What a hell of a campaign.

573
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:41,234
[SPEAKER_11]: You weren't outworked, Councilor.

574
00:55:41,354 --> 00:55:41,974
[SPEAKER_11]: You weren't outworked.

575
00:55:42,374 --> 00:55:43,474
[SPEAKER_11]: You did a great job out there.

576
00:55:43,494 --> 00:55:44,255
[SPEAKER_11]: You pounded the pavement.

577
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:45,515
[SPEAKER_11]: You're out there working hard every day.

578
00:55:46,085 --> 00:55:48,788
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think that anybody can ask for anything else.

579
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:50,670
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much for all your service.

580
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for what you've done to make the city of Medford a great place, Councilor.

581
00:55:54,335 --> 00:55:59,861
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that this is a retirement party, but I'm pretty sure that you're not going to be gone for a long time.

582
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:01,823
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much, Bob.

583
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:03,185
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a pleasure working alongside you.

584
00:56:21,292 --> 00:56:24,693
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I could, from the chair, thank you, Councilor Penta.

585
00:56:25,213 --> 00:56:31,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank you for the encouragement you gave me when I first ran, and all the support you gave me in that process.

586
00:56:32,915 --> 00:56:44,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Though I was born once you started serving, you did serve for my father, and I learned a lot from that era.

587
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:46,999
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been good to serve with you.

588
00:56:48,399 --> 00:56:50,240
[SPEAKER_15]: You've done very well for the people of Medford.

589
00:56:51,197 --> 00:56:56,320
[SPEAKER_15]: You've fought for a lot of people who didn't have a voice, and you made their voice heard.

590
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:00,622
[SPEAKER_15]: You've come to the end of your term.

591
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:20,312
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a wonderful opportunity to recreate your life, to enjoy it anew with Susan, to spend time in Florida, where all the retired politicians from Medford go, and sit around and look for things to do, drive their wives crazy,

592
00:57:22,468 --> 00:57:27,731
[SPEAKER_15]: and talk amongst themselves about how all of us left here don't know what they're doing.

593
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:34,394
[SPEAKER_15]: So we wish you well, and we hope you have a wonderful time.

594
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:35,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Bob.

595
00:57:44,266 --> 00:57:47,008
[SPEAKER_15]: So that on the motion of Councilor Marks be approved, all those in favor?

596
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:48,249
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

597
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:52,452
[SPEAKER_15]: And Councilor Camusos, yes.

598
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:56,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camusos, 15-817 also be approved.

599
00:57:56,676 --> 00:57:57,336
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

600
00:57:57,756 --> 00:57:58,377
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

601
00:57:58,897 --> 00:58:10,886
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're under suspension, be resolved, offered by Councilor Knight, that the Medford City Council congratulate Paul A. Camusos on his 15 years of service as an elected official in the City of Medford.

602
00:58:10,926 --> 00:58:11,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

603
00:58:12,162 --> 00:58:13,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

604
00:58:14,265 --> 00:58:25,836
[SPEAKER_11]: And my relationship with Councilor Camuso is a little bit different than mine with Councilor Penta, because I think that this Super Bowl Sunday, Paul, will be 30 years that we've known each other.

605
00:58:26,577 --> 00:58:28,899
[SPEAKER_11]: And our families have been friends for a long time.

606
00:58:28,919 --> 00:58:31,682
[SPEAKER_11]: His uncle Fred and my father taught together in Somerville for a number of years.

607
00:58:32,726 --> 00:58:43,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul and I have been very familiar with one another through Medford Youth Sports, Medford High School, his inaugural campaign, and I could go on and on about Paul's accomplishments.

608
00:58:43,855 --> 00:58:46,417
[SPEAKER_11]: We could go on and on about what a great guy Paul is.

609
00:58:47,937 --> 00:58:54,602
[SPEAKER_11]: how dedicated he is to the community, to his family, to his brothers, to his mother, to his late father and his grandmother.

610
00:58:55,683 --> 00:59:07,351
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that when you look at the election results over Paul's tenure and term, we'll see that he topped the ticket seven out of eight times, Mr. President, and I think that that speaks for itself.

611
00:59:08,492 --> 00:59:09,273
[SPEAKER_11]: The people of Medford

612
00:59:16,629 --> 00:59:19,332
[SPEAKER_11]: The people of Medford knew that Paul Camuso was doing his job.

613
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:21,354
[SPEAKER_11]: The people of Medford knew that Paul Camuso was working.

614
00:59:21,374 --> 00:59:27,061
[SPEAKER_11]: The people of Medford knew that Paul Camuso was an effective city council and an effective member of the school committee.

615
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:34,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just at awe, Paul, to sit here and see you step down and retire and go on to greener pastures.

616
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:41,444
[SPEAKER_11]: at this point in my young political career, because it wasn't too long ago that you were cheating off my papers in English class in high school.

617
00:59:42,004 --> 00:59:52,991
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd really just like to take a moment to thank you for your friendship, but more so thank you for your service, because when your political career ends,

618
00:59:53,744 --> 00:59:55,225
[SPEAKER_11]: You go back to being a normal citizen.

619
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:58,206
[SPEAKER_11]: And, well, as normal of a citizen as you can be.

620
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:03,648
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to the laughs that we've had and the laughs that we're going to have.

621
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:07,009
[SPEAKER_11]: I look forward to spending time with you and with your beautiful family.

622
01:00:07,449 --> 01:00:10,630
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just can't thank you enough for all that you've done for the community and for me personally.

623
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:18,653
[SPEAKER_11]: So, thank you very much for all.

624
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:31,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had the pleasure of knowing Paul Camuso many years, because my son is the same age and playing youth sports together and all those things.

625
01:00:31,905 --> 01:00:33,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew his mother and father very well.

626
01:00:33,405 --> 01:00:38,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't too long ago that I was driving Paul Camuso to school every day with my son.

627
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:40,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We carpooled every day.

628
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:47,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And who knew 20 years ago that I'd be sitting beside him here behind the rail helping the citizens of Medford.

629
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:53,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to thank him for his years of service and to the citizens of Method.

630
01:00:54,661 --> 01:01:10,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mother and father would be very proud to see the kind of person that you've grown up to be.

631
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:11,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

632
01:01:11,689 --> 01:01:18,493
[SPEAKER_18]: I too would like to congratulate Councilor Camuso on his retirement, although I don't believe he's retiring.

633
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:21,033
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good for now.

634
01:01:21,413 --> 01:01:29,398
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, when Paul first got elected, I remember during one of the debates, Paul had a catchy line, and the line went like this.

635
01:01:29,998 --> 01:01:36,322
[SPEAKER_18]: If you need your sidewalk done, if you need a tree trimmed, if you need the snow plowed in front of the house, you call Paul Camuso.

636
01:01:37,462 --> 01:01:38,663
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what, it dawned on me.

637
01:01:39,223 --> 01:01:43,746
[SPEAKER_18]: When I used to get constituent calls, I used to say, you know what, call Paul Camuso.

638
01:01:45,929 --> 01:01:52,555
[SPEAKER_18]: And let me tell you, sure enough, people would send me an email, call me back, say, hey, thank you for getting that done.

639
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:53,776
[SPEAKER_18]: I got my sidewalk done.

640
01:01:54,517 --> 01:01:59,121
[SPEAKER_18]: So Paul, you were more than a help, let me tell you, that you can understand.

641
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:01,603
[SPEAKER_18]: But as Councilor Camuso mentioned,

642
01:02:02,621 --> 01:02:07,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Paul championed a lot of things on this city council, a lot of issues that he felt near and dear.

643
01:02:08,304 --> 01:02:12,986
[SPEAKER_18]: He was always someone that did the homework and was present.

644
01:02:13,486 --> 01:02:21,089
[SPEAKER_18]: Paul, you know, you don't top the ticket, as Councilor Knight mentioned, without being out there, without talking to people, without having your finger on the pulse.

645
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:23,450
[SPEAKER_18]: And Paul was a constituent guy.

646
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,471
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what got him elected.

647
01:02:25,811 --> 01:02:28,513
[SPEAKER_18]: He thought all politics was local, like Tip O'Neill.

648
01:02:29,373 --> 01:02:29,974
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's true.

649
01:02:30,394 --> 01:02:31,034
[SPEAKER_18]: It is local.

650
01:02:31,394 --> 01:02:32,395
[SPEAKER_18]: And you have to be out there.

651
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,596
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to be in the forefront.

652
01:02:33,996 --> 01:02:35,377
[SPEAKER_18]: And you have to get back to people.

653
01:02:35,457 --> 01:02:41,120
[SPEAKER_18]: So the one thing that I can say about Councilor Camuso is that he returned the phone calls.

654
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,662
[SPEAKER_18]: He went to your house when you had a broken sidewalk.

655
01:02:44,522 --> 01:02:47,644
[SPEAKER_18]: And he was there when needed.

656
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:49,925
[SPEAKER_18]: And I respect that in him.

657
01:02:50,005 --> 01:02:52,407
[SPEAKER_18]: And I look forward to seeing him active in the community.

658
01:02:53,755 --> 01:02:57,358
[SPEAKER_18]: active with his family, his young son, and his lovely wife.

659
01:02:57,458 --> 01:03:02,323
[SPEAKER_18]: And I see your father-in-law here who never comes out, Frank Femino.

660
01:03:02,343 --> 01:03:04,385
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't seen Frank in... Hey, Frank!

661
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:11,171
[SPEAKER_18]: You must have promised him dinner tonight, because I haven't seen Frank out in a long time.

662
01:03:11,211 --> 01:03:17,717
[SPEAKER_18]: But no, with all candid, really, I wish you well in your retirement, and I hope to see you active in the community.

663
01:03:25,103 --> 01:03:26,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

664
01:03:26,684 --> 01:03:33,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to congratulate you, Paul, and thank you for your many years of service to the citizens of the city.

665
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:34,448
[SPEAKER_04]: You've done a great job.

666
01:03:34,468 --> 01:03:39,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one thing I admire is the responsiveness you had to the constituents.

667
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:45,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they'd call and like 30 seconds later, you'd be calling people back and something we can't even keep up with sometimes.

668
01:03:46,133 --> 01:03:47,874
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've done great work.

669
01:03:48,854 --> 01:03:51,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy your retirement with your family and your son.

670
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:52,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wish you the best.

671
01:04:01,056 --> 01:04:03,380
[SPEAKER_23]: I could tell you many stories about Paul Camuso.

672
01:04:05,343 --> 01:04:09,550
[SPEAKER_23]: I first met Paul when he drove up to my house many, many years ago before he decided to run for school committee.

673
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:11,052
[SPEAKER_23]: And from that point on,

674
01:04:12,113 --> 01:04:13,134
[SPEAKER_23]: It became a relationship.

675
01:04:13,855 --> 01:04:16,958
[SPEAKER_23]: He should really be working for the city in charge of constituent service.

676
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:20,422
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I think he really likes going out there and taking care of people's concerns.

677
01:04:20,842 --> 01:04:22,644
[SPEAKER_23]: Because he's like myself, he's a lover of government.

678
01:04:22,664 --> 01:04:24,446
[SPEAKER_23]: I like government in a different way than he likes it.

679
01:04:25,006 --> 01:04:31,032
[SPEAKER_23]: But the interesting part about Paul Camuso, he has made my life extremely interesting for the last 16 years in this council.

680
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:36,820
[SPEAKER_23]: Because if it wasn't for him, a lot of these issues really would never be magnified to the point that they are.

681
01:04:37,281 --> 01:04:40,703
[SPEAKER_23]: Whether you were a supporter or a proponent for the mayor or not or vice versa.

682
01:04:41,264 --> 01:04:43,986
[SPEAKER_23]: He made it very interesting because sometimes that's what you really need.

683
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:45,046
[SPEAKER_23]: You need this discourse.

684
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:46,287
[SPEAKER_23]: You need this difference of opinion.

685
01:04:46,628 --> 01:04:49,990
[SPEAKER_23]: And when you have a difference of opinion, that's when you learn sometimes what the issue is about.

686
01:04:50,532 --> 01:04:53,533
[SPEAKER_23]: And when the issue is being presented sometimes, you just lose concept of it.

687
01:04:54,173 --> 01:04:57,654
[SPEAKER_23]: But Paul and I, I believe we've had many, many differences.

688
01:04:57,694 --> 01:05:01,814
[SPEAKER_23]: But as he has said, at the end of the night, he'll come over and shake your hand, or I'll go over and talk to him, shake his hand.

689
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:02,995
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just an issue.

690
01:05:03,015 --> 01:05:03,835
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's all that it is.

691
01:05:03,915 --> 01:05:05,455
[SPEAKER_23]: And you move on from the subject matter.

692
01:05:06,215 --> 01:05:12,577
[SPEAKER_23]: And what's really interesting here, there's three people here that were, you people were that young when they first started?

693
01:05:12,937 --> 01:05:13,817
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't believe it.

694
01:05:14,947 --> 01:05:19,691
[SPEAKER_23]: But I'm not that old, so that's the point, okay?

695
01:05:19,771 --> 01:05:21,313
[SPEAKER_23]: So I want to wish you good luck.

696
01:05:21,373 --> 01:05:22,994
[SPEAKER_23]: Like him, I don't think he's going away.

697
01:05:23,014 --> 01:05:26,137
[SPEAKER_23]: He'll be around, and he's just taking a pause in life, and that's okay.

698
01:05:26,377 --> 01:05:30,180
[SPEAKER_23]: And sometimes you need to do that to refine yourself and get yourself back in action.

699
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:31,602
[SPEAKER_23]: So I congratulate you.

700
01:05:31,742 --> 01:05:32,282
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy your life.

701
01:05:32,302 --> 01:05:34,925
[SPEAKER_23]: Enjoy your wife and your family, because that's what it's really about.

702
01:05:34,945 --> 01:05:37,887
[SPEAKER_23]: The first thing in life is your family, and that's what you take care of.

703
01:05:38,308 --> 01:05:38,588
[SPEAKER_23]: Good luck.

704
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:54,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul, our relationship started off very rocky, and it got better over the years, very much better.

705
01:05:56,024 --> 01:05:58,186
[SPEAKER_15]: What everybody said behind this rail is true.

706
01:05:58,546 --> 01:06:05,730
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, you're probably one of the few people that have topped the ticket as consistently and as often as you have.

707
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:10,872
[SPEAKER_15]: That says a lot about your commitment to this community and the people who live here.

708
01:06:11,653 --> 01:06:16,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Constituent services, no one gets it done like you.

709
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:28,816
[SPEAKER_15]: So when someone calls and leaves a message on your phone and says, I need that pothole filled, you can call them up and say, look out your front window 10 minutes later and they'll see the steam rising on the street.

710
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:30,917
[SPEAKER_15]: You get it done.

711
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:41,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you understand, uh, the great complexities of how legislation locally and on the state level works.

712
01:06:41,903 --> 01:06:44,905
[SPEAKER_13]: You understand the complexities of, uh, the workings of,

713
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:54,513
[SPEAKER_15]: civic government, and the management of a city in a way that's above average of most people.

714
01:06:55,214 --> 01:07:10,240
[SPEAKER_15]: And those are all to your credit, and those are all things that have served you well as a Councilor, but will serve you well in whichever way you choose to serve the public again in the future.

715
01:07:12,082 --> 01:07:20,785
[SPEAKER_15]: It was difficult sitting next to you down there, because as Mr. Griffin will remember, when I was a student, I have a touch of the ADD.

716
01:07:21,726 --> 01:07:22,986
[SPEAKER_15]: And you have more of a touch.

717
01:07:23,947 --> 01:07:36,071
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the two of us would be ricocheting off the benches there while we should have been maybe paying attention to what was being debated on this floor.

718
01:07:37,662 --> 01:07:39,123
[SPEAKER_15]: You are a young man.

719
01:07:39,543 --> 01:07:43,085
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a long way to go as far as whatever it is you're going to do.

720
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:49,769
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope that you'll continue to serve your community in one way or another.

721
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:50,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Good luck.

722
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:53,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy your free time on Tuesday nights.

723
01:07:53,511 --> 01:07:54,212
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wish you well.

724
01:08:01,593 --> 01:08:11,460
[SPEAKER_15]: I think what we're going to do is just allow both you and Councilor Penta to address, and so we'll have Councilor Penta come up first where he's the senior member by service.

725
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:51,222
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I had a big speech prepared, but the first thing I'm going to say, I'm not retiring, and I'm not going to Florida.

726
01:08:51,462 --> 01:09:01,585
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm staying right here in the city of Medford, all right?

727
01:09:01,646 --> 01:09:09,488
[SPEAKER_23]: First of all, and more importantly, you know, I was getting a little emotional sitting over there, and I was at a point maybe getting a little teary-eyed.

728
01:09:09,508 --> 01:09:10,148
[SPEAKER_23]: But you know something?

729
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:11,629
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not going to do that tonight.

730
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:14,910
[SPEAKER_23]: Tonight, this is a congratulatory night for me.

731
01:09:15,867 --> 01:09:30,754
[SPEAKER_23]: I am so thankful that I have had an opportunity for serving in government for 36 years that was never once questioned as it relates to who or what I was about and why I was doing what I did.

732
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:32,935
[SPEAKER_23]: I did it for one particular reason.

733
01:09:33,115 --> 01:09:37,317
[SPEAKER_23]: I was elected by the people of this community to represent them to the best of my ability.

734
01:09:37,868 --> 01:09:40,691
[SPEAKER_23]: not for any personal, financial, or family gain.

735
01:09:41,251 --> 01:09:45,415
[SPEAKER_23]: I did this for one reason, because you, the people, are the most important people in this community.

736
01:09:45,635 --> 01:09:55,183
[SPEAKER_23]: That's why you elect folks like us, to be here and to do your business and to represent your finances, your education, and your wherewithal to the best of my ability.

737
01:09:55,764 --> 01:09:59,807
[SPEAKER_23]: When I first ran for office in 1974, I ran for state representative and I got elected.

738
01:10:00,688 --> 01:10:01,729
[SPEAKER_23]: There was a lady that I met.

739
01:10:02,955 --> 01:10:05,897
[SPEAKER_23]: And she happened to turn out to be the first woman mayor of the city of Medford.

740
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,578
[SPEAKER_23]: Her name was Marilyn Catino Perica.

741
01:10:08,298 --> 01:10:17,825
[SPEAKER_23]: And she gave me... She gave me a guidepost that I used in this very past election.

742
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:23,948
[SPEAKER_23]: It basically was, true leadership is found in the plan that one has to offer for respectful consideration.

743
01:10:24,909 --> 01:10:29,252
[SPEAKER_23]: As we all know, I did not run for re-election to the Medford City Council this past year.

744
01:10:29,832 --> 01:10:31,073
[SPEAKER_23]: I ran for the office of mayor.

745
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:39,987
[SPEAKER_23]: At the outset, I want to thank Anthony D'Antonio, because four years ago, he broke the ice, saying in this community, someone can run against the mayor.

746
01:10:40,547 --> 01:10:43,009
[SPEAKER_23]: No one is invincible, no one owns the job.

747
01:10:43,369 --> 01:10:47,032
[SPEAKER_23]: Unfortunately, he didn't make it, but he tried, and he got 36% of the vote.

748
01:10:47,273 --> 01:10:50,936
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a huge number to get, coming out of the box for the very first time.

749
01:10:51,836 --> 01:10:56,160
[SPEAKER_23]: I decided to run for this job this past time, only for one reason.

750
01:10:56,790 --> 01:11:06,538
[SPEAKER_23]: to present a plan, a plan that would give you a vision, a plan that would give you an opportunity, and a plan that would tell you how your taxes and how your buildings and how your educational system would work.

751
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:10,341
[SPEAKER_23]: I have to thank my wife, Susan.

752
01:11:11,402 --> 01:11:17,246
[SPEAKER_23]: She was the campaign manager to my campaign, and you know, I don't know why, she never was involved in politics before.

753
01:11:18,167 --> 01:11:23,251
[SPEAKER_23]: I needed and wanted someone who could talk to me and relate to the, as the person on the street,

754
01:11:23,681 --> 01:11:28,162
[SPEAKER_23]: and you can't say this, and this is what you should be doing, and how do we make this connection work?

755
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:42,527
[SPEAKER_23]: She stabilized me during this campaign, because everyone knows, at the drop of a dime, I could lose it, and I have, and I have, and I'll admit it, and I have, and I have probably at council meetings in the past through the years, and that's only because of my passion for the job.

756
01:11:43,127 --> 01:11:46,828
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not because of any hate for or against any one person or any one issue.

757
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:55,584
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, the one thing this community really has to figure out, and with all due respect to the incoming administration, this election was not a landslide victory.

758
01:11:56,064 --> 01:12:03,069
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's a lot of work to be done here to make this city go in the right direction and to bring people together.

759
01:12:03,269 --> 01:12:07,873
[SPEAKER_23]: And to bring people together, there has to be an understanding that folks need to be involved.

760
01:12:07,933 --> 01:12:08,833
[SPEAKER_23]: And how do you get involved?

761
01:12:08,853 --> 01:12:09,774
[SPEAKER_23]: You need to speak up.

762
01:12:09,794 --> 01:12:13,016
[SPEAKER_23]: You come to that podium on a Tuesday night or whatever it might be.

763
01:12:13,877 --> 01:12:14,878
[SPEAKER_23]: I will assure you of this.

764
01:12:16,297 --> 01:12:43,117
[SPEAKER_23]: I may be sitting there now up until January 4th, but I'll be behind that rail after January 4th, because if I think there's something... Because if I believe that there is something of major importance to our community, no voice should be stifled, past, present, or the future.

765
01:12:43,619 --> 01:12:44,760
[SPEAKER_23]: Because that's what it's all about.

766
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,703
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm 71 years old, and I'm proud of it.

767
01:12:46,983 --> 01:12:47,964
[SPEAKER_23]: But I'm not old.

768
01:12:48,024 --> 01:12:51,208
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not going to sit in a rocking chair, and I'm not going away.

769
01:12:58,137 --> 01:12:59,719
[SPEAKER_23]: Two particular points I want to bring up.

770
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:02,021
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think it definitely needs to be cleared up.

771
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:06,799
[SPEAKER_23]: because it was misdirected during this past campaign for mayor.

772
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,643
[SPEAKER_23]: I was never against new schools.

773
01:13:09,903 --> 01:13:14,148
[SPEAKER_23]: What I was against was the opportunity for the people of Medford to have voted for new schools.

774
01:13:14,468 --> 01:13:15,249
[SPEAKER_23]: That's number one.

775
01:13:15,689 --> 01:13:17,892
[SPEAKER_23]: Number two, you were taking away your community schools.

776
01:13:18,192 --> 01:13:22,674
[SPEAKER_23]: So when we went to 14 schools down to four, that was a huge change in this community.

777
01:13:22,974 --> 01:13:25,836
[SPEAKER_23]: And a lot of people did not have their input into that.

778
01:13:26,256 --> 01:13:34,080
[SPEAKER_23]: And as a result of that, and the reason why we built new schools at that point in time, some 15 years ago, was the schools were becoming run down.

779
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:38,602
[SPEAKER_23]: They were becoming misused or not used correctly, and they needed a lot of repairs.

780
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:42,083
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, here we are now, some 15 years later.

781
01:13:42,483 --> 01:13:53,526
[SPEAKER_23]: Rick Caviale, on his first year on the term, that's four years ago, that would have made it 11 years ago, produced a paper that said the new schools are $1,102,000 in repairs.

782
01:13:53,826 --> 01:13:55,187
[SPEAKER_23]: We're right back to where we were.

783
01:13:55,487 --> 01:13:56,767
[SPEAKER_23]: That's why we built the new schools.

784
01:13:57,267 --> 01:14:03,609
[SPEAKER_23]: There is the need to making sure that the new council, the new school committee stays on top of their buildings, because look right up there.

785
01:14:03,929 --> 01:14:05,330
[SPEAKER_23]: That's almost three years old.

786
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:08,212
[SPEAKER_23]: Three years old, and the city has yet to fix that.

787
01:14:08,972 --> 01:14:13,876
[SPEAKER_23]: And the superintendent of schools was sitting right over there when that ceiling fell, and it still hasn't been fixed.

788
01:14:14,736 --> 01:14:16,217
[SPEAKER_23]: People, you've got to be involved.

789
01:14:16,237 --> 01:14:17,338
[SPEAKER_23]: You need to stay involved.

790
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:21,701
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, I'm over this feeling right now of being sad.

791
01:14:21,741 --> 01:14:22,362
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sad.

792
01:14:23,483 --> 01:14:32,569
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm glad because I have created a new family for myself, a family of people not only who believe, but they need and they want the change to take place in this community.

793
01:14:32,669 --> 01:14:33,410
[SPEAKER_23]: They don't want it.

794
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:48,195
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, this past election presented an awful lot of opportunities for everyone.

795
01:14:48,455 --> 01:14:50,696
[SPEAKER_23]: Opportunities for people to write for or write against.

796
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:54,418
[SPEAKER_23]: Whether you liked me or didn't like me, whether you liked my opponent, whether you liked my Councilors or not.

797
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:57,520
[SPEAKER_23]: You have two brand new Councilors, you have two brand new school committee people.

798
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:05,084
[SPEAKER_23]: That in and of itself should open up big doors for the people in this community who want to see how and where their election process is going.

799
01:15:05,925 --> 01:15:07,526
[SPEAKER_23]: And do they vote for the right people?

800
01:15:08,514 --> 01:15:13,497
[SPEAKER_23]: The only way you're gonna find out if you vote for the right people, don't wait for two years and wait for the campaign literature to come out.

801
01:15:14,237 --> 01:15:20,741
[SPEAKER_23]: Watch, as I will, each and every week and each and every month, what's taking place on the school committee, what's taking place at the city council.

802
01:15:20,961 --> 01:15:24,383
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you don't like it, speak up, I'll call your council, I'll call your school committee person.

803
01:15:25,023 --> 01:15:29,446
[SPEAKER_23]: You just can't be a lump in the log and say, I'm against it, I don't like it, you need to speak up.

804
01:15:30,367 --> 01:15:32,268
[SPEAKER_23]: And people did speak up in this last election.

805
01:15:32,668 --> 01:15:35,910
[SPEAKER_23]: Unfortunately, it was a beautiful day, only 38% of the people came out to vote.

806
01:15:36,772 --> 01:15:39,754
[SPEAKER_23]: Hopefully, I think on both sides, everybody would have thought more people would have come out.

807
01:15:39,955 --> 01:15:40,435
[SPEAKER_23]: But they didn't.

808
01:15:40,975 --> 01:15:42,496
[SPEAKER_23]: But the 38 percent, they spoke.

809
01:15:43,137 --> 01:15:45,579
[SPEAKER_23]: It was close, and I think we'll all acknowledge the fact it was close.

810
01:15:46,059 --> 01:15:47,600
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's no mandate one way or the other.

811
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,342
[SPEAKER_23]: But there is one mandate, and that's this.

812
01:15:49,702 --> 01:15:55,086
[SPEAKER_23]: I think the people of this community expect the elected politicians to do their job on behalf of the people of this community.

813
01:15:55,346 --> 01:15:57,028
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what I did for 36 years.

814
01:15:57,448 --> 01:15:59,990
[SPEAKER_23]: I did my job, and I'm proud of the fact that I did do it.

815
01:16:13,173 --> 01:16:17,236
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, there's always people during the campaign that you want to acknowledge.

816
01:16:17,296 --> 01:16:18,197
[SPEAKER_23]: And there's so many.

817
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:19,518
[SPEAKER_23]: I could look at this entire audience.

818
01:16:20,138 --> 01:16:23,501
[SPEAKER_23]: But to me, he's my unsung hero in each and every one of my campaigns.

819
01:16:23,601 --> 01:16:25,723
[SPEAKER_23]: Whenever I ask him to do anything, he just does it.

820
01:16:25,743 --> 01:16:26,784
[SPEAKER_23]: And there's no questions asked.

821
01:16:27,064 --> 01:16:28,125
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's my brother, Anthony.

822
01:16:28,165 --> 01:16:31,367
[SPEAKER_23]: And I have to publicly acknowledge him, because that's what he is.

823
01:16:39,293 --> 01:16:40,935
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just caught her eye in the back of the room.

824
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:43,422
[SPEAKER_23]: And I want to publicly acknowledge you, Nancy.

825
01:16:43,922 --> 01:16:46,403
[SPEAKER_23]: You came here on behalf of the Perica family.

826
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:52,406
[SPEAKER_23]: She and her family stood out at the polls for me on Election Day because they believed in me, and I thank you very much.

827
01:16:52,466 --> 01:16:53,246
[SPEAKER_23]: Nancy Perica.

828
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:05,932
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, we could go on and on with stories here.

829
01:17:06,152 --> 01:17:07,893
[SPEAKER_23]: And the second thing, I told you about the schools.

830
01:17:08,473 --> 01:17:10,874
[SPEAKER_23]: And the second thing are the kiosks here in the square.

831
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:13,144
[SPEAKER_23]: As you all know, I'm just dead set against them.

832
01:17:13,164 --> 01:17:14,244
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think they're working right.

833
01:17:14,344 --> 01:17:27,390
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think they, I don't think that, you know, you know, there's, there's a resolution on the council agenda here tonight and it reflects upon the fact that during this past campaign, my opponent put out a questionnaire as it relates to senior citizens.

834
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:28,831
[SPEAKER_23]: Should they be allowed to park for nothing?

835
01:17:29,191 --> 01:17:34,413
[SPEAKER_23]: Not only do I support that, if we're going to tweak it, then let it be tweaked and give some benefit back to this community.

836
01:17:34,694 --> 01:17:37,675
[SPEAKER_23]: And I would hope that this city council holds the president administration

837
01:17:38,462 --> 01:17:42,745
[SPEAKER_23]: feet to the fire by telling the Republic parking people that seniors do not have to park here.

838
01:17:42,905 --> 01:17:47,228
[SPEAKER_23]: It's bad enough that you get taxed for everything else, and 45 percent of this community is made up of seniors.

839
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:56,593
[SPEAKER_23]: Give them a break, folks, because you get the water, you get the meals tax, you get the hotel tax, and you get your real estate tax, and anything else you want to talk about just keeps going up in this community.

840
01:17:57,034 --> 01:18:00,276
[SPEAKER_23]: And while everything keeps going up in this community, salaries have not gotten up.

841
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:03,418
[SPEAKER_23]: Everyone that works in this building works for you.

842
01:18:03,718 --> 01:18:07,120
[SPEAKER_23]: Your taxpaying dollars pay for everyone's job in this particular building.

843
01:18:07,693 --> 01:18:10,075
[SPEAKER_23]: To get your biggest bank for the buck, let them work for you.

844
01:18:10,455 --> 01:18:11,736
[SPEAKER_23]: And that would be an easy way to do it.

845
01:18:11,796 --> 01:18:15,618
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember, this republic company is here for 10 years, and you've got no control over it.

846
01:18:15,878 --> 01:18:21,322
[SPEAKER_23]: But the one thing you have control over is the people who signed off on that contract, and they have a right to go there and negotiate.

847
01:18:22,123 --> 01:18:29,768
[SPEAKER_23]: And when my opposition turn around and put that out there, and that's one thing I would be supportive of, that senior citizens of this city park for nothing in the city of Medford.

848
01:18:30,168 --> 01:18:31,329
[SPEAKER_23]: They don't deserve to pay.

849
01:18:38,652 --> 01:18:40,774
[SPEAKER_23]: When I mention my wife Susan, you have to understand something.

850
01:18:42,315 --> 01:18:46,778
[SPEAKER_23]: As much as a novice she is, she's been an educator for 23 years as a retired school teacher.

851
01:18:47,619 --> 01:18:50,401
[SPEAKER_23]: So she knows what English, the language is all about.

852
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:53,124
[SPEAKER_23]: Sometimes when I talk too fast, I say the wrong words.

853
01:18:53,204 --> 01:18:54,745
[SPEAKER_23]: It just doesn't come out right.

854
01:18:55,205 --> 01:18:56,286
[SPEAKER_23]: And she says, you can't do that.

855
01:18:56,306 --> 01:18:57,047
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't say that.

856
01:18:57,787 --> 01:18:58,568
[SPEAKER_23]: But I am blessed.

857
01:18:59,929 --> 01:19:02,271
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, Paul sort of like hit it on the head.

858
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:07,375
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been blessed with two women in my life and two families in my life.

859
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:10,519
[SPEAKER_23]: I am a very lucky man.

860
01:19:10,539 --> 01:19:12,040
[SPEAKER_23]: I am very thankful.

861
01:19:13,902 --> 01:19:14,862
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't lose an election.

862
01:19:14,882 --> 01:19:15,583
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what I won?

863
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:20,827
[SPEAKER_23]: I won the people of the city of Medford who believed in Bob Penta because I believe in you folks.

864
01:19:21,468 --> 01:19:23,990
[SPEAKER_23]: And with that being said, I want to conclude by saying the following.

865
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:26,532
[SPEAKER_23]: My friend, Jimmy DeVito, you'll understand this.

866
01:19:27,673 --> 01:19:36,900
[SPEAKER_23]: In 1942, it was General Douglas MacArthur who had to leave the Philippine Islands because at the Battle of Bataan, they got beaten up pretty bad.

867
01:19:37,721 --> 01:19:43,422
[SPEAKER_23]: And he was supposed to be taking a submarine to leave the islands, because eventually he had to get to Australia.

868
01:19:44,222 --> 01:19:45,783
[SPEAKER_23]: But he decided not to take that.

869
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:51,124
[SPEAKER_23]: He decided to take a PT boat and go up in the middle of the night to beat the Japanese at that point in time.

870
01:19:51,184 --> 01:19:54,125
[SPEAKER_23]: And unfortunately, they ran into inclement weather on the whole nine yards.

871
01:19:55,005 --> 01:19:58,266
[SPEAKER_23]: So as a result of that, he was one of the two days in the water.

872
01:19:58,306 --> 01:19:59,586
[SPEAKER_23]: He was in open water.

873
01:20:00,364 --> 01:20:09,547
[SPEAKER_23]: But he was very lucky, because there was no Japanese boat that saw him traversing that water, getting to where he had to go to, in Mindanao.

874
01:20:11,328 --> 01:20:14,869
[SPEAKER_23]: Two days later, when he finally landed there, he made a very famous speech.

875
01:20:16,009 --> 01:20:18,590
[SPEAKER_23]: And when he made that speech, it was in Melbourne, Australia.

876
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:20,130
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is what he said.

877
01:20:20,891 --> 01:20:22,271
[SPEAKER_23]: This is his declaratory lines.

878
01:20:22,311 --> 01:20:24,712
[SPEAKER_23]: He says, I came through, and I shall return.

879
01:20:27,806 --> 01:20:30,769
[SPEAKER_23]: I took those lines and he says, how can I make that work for me tonight?

880
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:33,631
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is what I said.

881
01:20:34,772 --> 01:20:40,977
[SPEAKER_23]: With that said, and with a Penta on the city ballots for the past 38 years, stay tuned.

882
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:47,342
[SPEAKER_23]: And while there may be a Penta in a pause mode, there will be a Penta to be continued in our days ahead.

883
01:21:04,138 --> 01:21:09,702
[SPEAKER_23]: I thank you, my family, my friends, and even those folks who don't like me or didn't vote for me, because you know why?

884
01:21:10,082 --> 01:21:11,963
[SPEAKER_23]: You expressed your opinion, and I'm okay with that.

885
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:21,650
[SPEAKER_23]: And for all those who've supported me in my positions through the years, and may our loving and forgiving God bless all of us, and may God bless us all as he sees fit.

886
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:22,470
[SPEAKER_23]: Bon attab.

887
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:22,971
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

888
01:21:40,016 --> 01:21:48,582
[SPEAKER_23]: I would be absolutely remiss if I didn't say this, because the highest thing on my scale of friendship is loyalty, and I forgot to say it.

889
01:21:49,163 --> 01:21:57,229
[SPEAKER_23]: There's one person, and I will embarrass him, he's right over there, that guy right there, Michael Marks, from the day that I announced.

890
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:09,178
[SPEAKER_23]: From the day that I announced, no questions asked, he stepped up, came forward,

891
01:22:10,287 --> 01:22:21,334
[SPEAKER_23]: over and beyond my friends, my new extended family of friends, but for an elected official to put his neck on the line, no questions asked, no wanting for anything, that to me is what it's all about.

892
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:24,637
[SPEAKER_23]: These are my friends, you are my friends, and God bless you all.

893
01:22:24,717 --> 01:22:25,057
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

894
01:23:01,124 --> 01:23:01,385
Thank you.

895
01:23:39,624 --> 01:23:42,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor, you wanted to say?

896
01:23:43,586 --> 01:23:44,126
[SPEAKER_22]: You know something?

897
01:23:45,826 --> 01:23:46,387
[SPEAKER_22]: His tie.

898
01:23:46,427 --> 01:23:47,287
[SPEAKER_22]: Listen to his tie.

899
01:23:47,907 --> 01:23:48,087
[SPEAKER_22]: Huh?

900
01:23:48,227 --> 01:23:48,928
[SPEAKER_22]: Listen to your tie.

901
01:23:49,008 --> 01:23:49,448
[SPEAKER_22]: My tie.

902
01:23:49,468 --> 01:23:51,829
[SPEAKER_22]: There.

903
01:23:52,509 --> 01:23:52,849
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

904
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:56,070
[SPEAKER_23]: I would be absolutely remiss.

905
01:23:57,211 --> 01:23:57,951
[SPEAKER_23]: My daughter, Kim.

906
01:23:58,611 --> 01:23:59,872
[SPEAKER_23]: My son-in-law, Patrick.

907
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,653
[SPEAKER_23]: Aaron, my extended daughter.

908
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:07,815
[SPEAKER_23]: Aaron.

909
01:24:10,691 --> 01:24:18,674
[SPEAKER_14]: And Ryan.

910
01:24:24,357 --> 01:24:25,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

911
01:24:25,257 --> 01:24:28,518
[SPEAKER_21]: That was a very nice send-off, nice speech.

912
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:32,420
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I grew up in this city.

913
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:38,702
[SPEAKER_21]: As you all know, basically the only two mayors that I remember are Mayor Parikh and Mayor McGlynn.

914
01:24:41,623 --> 01:24:42,043
[SPEAKER_21]: Excuse me.

915
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:44,685
[SPEAKER_21]: Still a little emotional, you know.

916
01:24:47,767 --> 01:24:57,615
[SPEAKER_21]: During my last 16 years as a member of the city council, you know, I had some of the best times of my life, but also some of the toughest times of my life.

917
01:24:58,355 --> 01:25:09,404
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, a few people upstairs right now looking down that I know are proud of me are my dad, that many of you knew, Al, and my grandmother.

918
01:25:10,263 --> 01:25:16,347
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I remember the, uh, the parties, the election night parties at my grandmother's house.

919
01:25:16,467 --> 01:25:38,480
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh, we had some fun, you know, but, uh, you know, also in 2006, I married my best friend, Janine, you know, Janine, thank you for being there for me because as, um, as Susan knows, and the rest of the spouses of the, uh, Councilors, this is a full-time job, you know, and, uh, I, I, I had the, um,

920
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,779
[SPEAKER_21]: I had the, the word I'm looking for.

921
01:25:45,528 --> 01:25:46,568
[SPEAKER_21]: I had the vision.

922
01:25:47,269 --> 01:25:54,611
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw that I was spending too much time actually doing this job and not enough time where it actually was important on occasion.

923
01:25:55,131 --> 01:25:56,012
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's at home.

924
01:25:56,832 --> 01:26:01,954
[SPEAKER_21]: Because this job does take a toll upon you and more your loved ones than you.

925
01:26:02,914 --> 01:26:06,475
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd be here fighting with my friend, and I'd be getting calls at my house.

926
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:08,036
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got good supporters.

927
01:26:08,056 --> 01:26:09,316
[SPEAKER_21]: They'd call and yell at my poor wife.

928
01:26:11,377 --> 01:26:15,260
[SPEAKER_21]: But you know the stuff that goes along with this job.

929
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:18,181
[SPEAKER_21]: And for that, I'm forever grateful, honey.

930
01:26:18,301 --> 01:26:21,483
[SPEAKER_21]: You've been there through some of my biggest struggles in life.

931
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,044
[SPEAKER_21]: And you're the best.

932
01:26:23,105 --> 01:26:23,465
[SPEAKER_21]: I love you.

933
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:35,552
[SPEAKER_21]: Moving ahead a little bit, a couple of years.

934
01:26:35,913 --> 01:26:37,874
[SPEAKER_21]: Next best, well, they're equal.

935
01:26:38,918 --> 01:26:42,020
[SPEAKER_21]: Best thing in my life is that little guy sitting in row number two.

936
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,081
[SPEAKER_21]: Little Jimmy, stand up.

937
01:26:44,122 --> 01:26:44,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Stand up, buddy.

938
01:26:52,547 --> 01:26:54,129
[SPEAKER_21]: As Bob said, this is what it's all about.

939
01:26:54,169 --> 01:26:54,889
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the family.

940
01:26:54,929 --> 01:27:05,296
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm really looking forward to just getting grounded again and getting back into some sort of sense of normalcy of not being out on, it's not just Tuesday nights.

941
01:27:06,687 --> 01:27:10,630
[SPEAKER_21]: It's many a nights and you know the constituent service part, we have people in this room.

942
01:27:11,431 --> 01:27:15,214
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm only as good as the people that have supported me and got me to where I needed to be at first.

943
01:27:15,274 --> 01:27:22,379
[SPEAKER_21]: And a few people that I want to acknowledge from my family is my brother John and my brother Mike.

944
01:27:29,998 --> 01:27:31,178
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I was very lucky.

945
01:27:31,218 --> 01:27:37,641
[SPEAKER_21]: I got great in-laws and, and, uh, they do more babysitting for me to get out and to do the constituent stuff.

946
01:27:38,341 --> 01:27:44,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, and, and, uh, you know, you're going to get a little more free time on your hands now too, Jeannie and Frank, cause I'll be home a little bit more.

947
01:27:44,864 --> 01:27:51,767
[SPEAKER_21]: So, uh, so thank you for all that you've, uh, done for me and my family, um, over the years and also my brother-in-law Frank.

948
01:27:52,427 --> 01:27:58,650
[SPEAKER_21]: But, um, you know, my original committee, they're mostly here tonight when I decided to run for office in 1999.

949
01:28:00,593 --> 01:28:04,874
[SPEAKER_21]: I gathered the people that were just closest to me and near and dear.

950
01:28:05,314 --> 01:28:08,655
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's my aunt, my campaign manager, Carol Regan, who's right there.

951
01:28:09,616 --> 01:28:14,877
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, auntie.

952
01:28:15,137 --> 01:28:24,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Another person who's well known in this community from Medford Youth Hockey and just a real great person is Len Galeona, who's right here.

953
01:28:28,747 --> 01:28:34,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, someone that is on the DPW, I don't know if he's still here, but Mike Nesta, another original.

954
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:36,506
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the original guys.

955
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:42,084
[SPEAKER_21]: And also my pal, Jason, you know, right from the very beginning.

956
01:28:42,924 --> 01:28:51,768
[SPEAKER_21]: My buddy, Jason Traviglione, he was there right from the beginning with several of my other cousins, Tommy, Terry, Tony, Johnny, Joey, and Artie.

957
01:28:51,988 --> 01:28:52,928
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we hit the streets.

958
01:28:52,948 --> 01:28:53,929
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'll tell you a funny story.

959
01:28:54,349 --> 01:28:55,529
[SPEAKER_21]: You talk about walking the streets.

960
01:28:56,209 --> 01:28:56,930
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll never forget it.

961
01:28:57,090 --> 01:28:58,970
[SPEAKER_21]: It was one of your neighbors on Summit Road.

962
01:28:59,351 --> 01:29:00,791
[SPEAKER_21]: We're passing out the first literature.

963
01:29:01,511 --> 01:29:02,272
[SPEAKER_21]: Guy calls me over.

964
01:29:02,312 --> 01:29:02,832
[SPEAKER_21]: I like the thing.

965
01:29:02,872 --> 01:29:03,332
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks good.

966
01:29:03,652 --> 01:29:04,913
[SPEAKER_21]: But you spelt commitment wrong.

967
01:29:05,553 --> 01:29:05,773
[SPEAKER_21]: I go.

968
01:29:06,436 --> 01:29:07,277
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got to be kidding me.

969
01:29:07,557 --> 01:29:12,380
[SPEAKER_21]: So instead of passing out literature, we're running back up the hill trying to take the literature back.

970
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:17,043
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course, like any good politician, you tell a little fib.

971
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:19,244
[SPEAKER_21]: I blame the printer, but it was really my fault.

972
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:25,817
[SPEAKER_21]: A few City Hall department heads that have really been there for me over the years.

973
01:29:25,878 --> 01:29:34,924
[SPEAKER_21]: That's Roy Belson from the schools, Mark Rumley, who's in the room in the back there, as well as the past president of the Medford City Council, Bob Mayorko.

974
01:29:35,484 --> 01:29:42,890
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, the people that were just very helpful over the years in giving me guidance, and I want to thank them for that.

975
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,692
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, 16 years is a long time.

976
01:29:46,552 --> 01:29:50,315
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I went back and just was plugging in the years on the computer, because I knew I had to speak tonight.

977
01:29:51,113 --> 01:29:53,275
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems, uh, it was in 2000.

978
01:29:53,495 --> 01:29:59,620
[SPEAKER_21]: That's when, uh, the big race between Al Gore and George Bush, when we didn't know who the president was.

979
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,322
[SPEAKER_21]: That seems like many, many, many years ago.

980
01:30:02,963 --> 01:30:09,848
[SPEAKER_21]: A few years later or the next year we had September 11th, you know, and, um, there was also the good things.

981
01:30:10,969 --> 01:30:18,856
[SPEAKER_21]: As I was an elected official, I was able to stand here and get my picture taken with the world series trophy, a Patriots trophy, and also a Bruins trophy.

982
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:20,037
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, that's, uh,

983
01:30:21,485 --> 01:30:23,747
[SPEAKER_21]: That just tells you how long 16 years is.

984
01:30:23,807 --> 01:30:25,169
[SPEAKER_21]: And 16 years is a long time.

985
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:26,109
[SPEAKER_21]: I couldn't do it, 38.

986
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:29,472
[SPEAKER_21]: No, sirree.

987
01:30:30,413 --> 01:30:32,855
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, as far as the councillors, I mentioned Bob Mayorko.

988
01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:42,984
[SPEAKER_21]: Other two councillors that I served with when I first got on, it was Councilor Bill Carr, who Bill was just another good guy, and Councilor Macarena, who I served with for a short period of time.

989
01:30:43,024 --> 01:30:45,667
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to thank them, because I know how

990
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:50,231
[SPEAKER_21]: how this is sometimes on your family life and everything else.

991
01:30:50,271 --> 01:30:55,712
[SPEAKER_21]: So it doesn't go unnoticed, the sacrifice that all the councilors here have made over the years.

992
01:30:57,512 --> 01:31:03,613
[SPEAKER_21]: Michael Marks, you know, when we first started out, Michael Marks and myself, we were close.

993
01:31:03,813 --> 01:31:09,735
[SPEAKER_21]: We were in that first little block of four who made Stephanie Muccini-Burke the president of the Medford City Council.

994
01:31:10,315 --> 01:31:12,295
[SPEAKER_21]: And we drifted apart over the years.

995
01:31:12,695 --> 01:31:13,876
[SPEAKER_21]: But Michael, you're a stalwart.

996
01:31:14,116 --> 01:31:14,756
[SPEAKER_21]: You're a good kid.

997
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,342
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got a good career ahead of you, and it's been a pleasure to serve with you.

998
01:31:20,422 --> 01:31:23,604
[SPEAKER_21]: And he said he's going to be on that side, so you ain't getting home early.

999
01:31:27,826 --> 01:31:28,987
[SPEAKER_21]: Ricky, what else can I say?

1000
01:31:29,047 --> 01:31:32,669
[SPEAKER_21]: As you said, you used to drive us to Austin Prep with Ricky.

1001
01:31:32,709 --> 01:31:40,274
[SPEAKER_21]: We'd be driving up to Austin Prep in the morning, and like screwballs, we'd put our hand out the window when it was 30 degrees so we could keep the hand outside the window longer.

1002
01:31:40,294 --> 01:31:42,315
[SPEAKER_21]: Just stupid, stupid.

1003
01:31:43,536 --> 01:31:45,157
[SPEAKER_21]: But you'd be yelling at us.

1004
01:31:46,009 --> 01:31:48,110
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm freezing in here, you know.

1005
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:50,311
[SPEAKER_21]: But you're just a great, great guy.

1006
01:31:50,572 --> 01:31:55,374
[SPEAKER_21]: And your wife, Carol, who certainly is also a big champion behind you.

1007
01:31:57,487 --> 01:32:03,452
[SPEAKER_21]: Fred Dello Russo, when I first ran, I didn't know if I was running for the Medford City Council or running against Fred Dello Russo, you know?

1008
01:32:03,952 --> 01:32:09,056
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody in this city made it a Camuso-Dello Russo race when Freddy first ran for office.

1009
01:32:09,096 --> 01:32:10,657
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure some of you remember that.

1010
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:16,121
[SPEAKER_21]: And so as Fred stated, it was a rocky start, but you know something, Fred?

1011
01:32:17,022 --> 01:32:19,804
[SPEAKER_21]: Me and you became best pals here, you know?

1012
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:27,528
[SPEAKER_21]: This guy right here, he's there for people in their time of need, but he's also been there for me, uh, as a fellow city councilor.

1013
01:32:27,988 --> 01:32:33,791
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh, and on occasion when I get ramped up, he'd tell me, Hey, calm down.

1014
01:32:33,851 --> 01:32:34,872
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'd listen to him sometimes.

1015
01:32:35,442 --> 01:32:37,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Other times there was no stopping the kid.

1016
01:32:38,243 --> 01:32:41,064
[SPEAKER_21]: But Fred, you know, I really value our friendship.

1017
01:32:41,524 --> 01:32:43,505
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know we're going to be lifelong friends.

1018
01:32:43,565 --> 01:32:47,327
[SPEAKER_21]: And your dad also was there for me when I first ran for school committee.

1019
01:32:47,347 --> 01:32:48,947
[SPEAKER_21]: And just you come from an outstanding family.

1020
01:32:49,487 --> 01:32:51,608
[SPEAKER_21]: And thank you for being my friend.

1021
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:58,511
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam, thank God for that English test.

1022
01:32:59,834 --> 01:33:03,015
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, Adam, uh, Adam and I have been friends for many, many years.

1023
01:33:03,475 --> 01:33:05,816
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, Adam was there for me early on in my campaigns.

1024
01:33:06,377 --> 01:33:08,697
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh, I just wish I had more time to serve with you.

1025
01:33:09,118 --> 01:33:21,542
[SPEAKER_21]: But, um, as I stated a little earlier, I just, uh, I'm looking forward to a little time off and, um, and having a nine to five, uh, day rather than, um, I will stay up, watch about half the city council meetings, I think.

1026
01:33:22,143 --> 01:33:25,384
[SPEAKER_21]: But, uh, but, uh, Adam, you're, you're just a great person.

1027
01:33:26,196 --> 01:33:31,820
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn, you know, went to Medford High School with Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1028
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:35,822
[SPEAKER_21]: And just, you're just a good kid.

1029
01:33:35,863 --> 01:33:37,444
[SPEAKER_21]: You also fight, I call them kids.

1030
01:33:37,544 --> 01:33:39,465
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm only a year older than that.

1031
01:33:39,845 --> 01:33:41,006
[SPEAKER_21]: You're just a great person, you know.

1032
01:33:41,506 --> 01:33:47,070
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've watched you over the years become a good councilor, but also a mom of three children.

1033
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,202
[SPEAKER_21]: I find it tough with one child being a councillor.

1034
01:33:52,843 --> 01:34:01,530
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, you really are just, you're a stalwart, and you get out, and you really work hard, and I want to thank you for your friendship over the years.

1035
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:15,822
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Bob, I've already said it, you're a good guy, and I'm going to miss our fights, because to be honest with you, I'm going to be honest with you, and if he wasn't there and I wasn't there, the meetings would be boring.

1036
01:34:17,043 --> 01:34:17,424
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair to say?

1037
01:34:25,275 --> 01:34:28,321
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, a few other people that I'd just like to.

1038
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:31,811
[SPEAKER_21]: to congratulate and thank is right over here.

1039
01:34:32,351 --> 01:34:36,653
[SPEAKER_21]: These two young fellas over here, George Scarpelli and John Falco.

1040
01:34:36,933 --> 01:34:41,215
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that Bob and I leave this evening, and we're leaving it in good hands.

1041
01:34:41,495 --> 01:34:43,296
[SPEAKER_21]: These are two guys that are coming from the school committee.

1042
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:47,598
[SPEAKER_21]: They understand the complexity of issues, and it's not always a quick, easy fix.

1043
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:56,662
[SPEAKER_21]: As Councilor Dello Russo stated a little earlier, the legislative process sometimes moves a little bit slower than people would like, but at the end of the day,

1044
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,891
[SPEAKER_21]: This city's in good hands with the people coming on.

1045
01:35:03,631 --> 01:35:10,013
[SPEAKER_21]: Being that person that just drives the DPW crazy over the years, I saved the best for last.

1046
01:35:10,373 --> 01:35:15,854
[SPEAKER_21]: The DPW, people don't realize the work that they do on a daily basis.

1047
01:35:15,874 --> 01:35:25,916
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not only dealing with the stuff when they get in in the morning that they have the long list of stuff, but they're dealing with seven city councillors calling them, they're dealing with residents calling them, they're dealing with the mayor's office calling them, they're dealing with just

1048
01:35:26,818 --> 01:35:30,483
[SPEAKER_21]: They stop to get a cup of coffee and people are yelling and screaming, and this and that.

1049
01:35:31,044 --> 01:35:40,557
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, people don't realize that the snow plowing, they think that after the DPW plows the snow away from their driveway, that they just come by to get a chuckle and put it back there.

1050
01:35:40,757 --> 01:35:41,097
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not.

1051
01:35:41,198 --> 01:35:43,220
[SPEAKER_21]: It's to keep the streets clear for emergency vehicles.

1052
01:35:43,881 --> 01:35:47,423
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a job that you do very, very good.

1053
01:35:47,943 --> 01:35:54,706
[SPEAKER_21]: And Steve Tanagli is in the back of the room, and he works as well with Mike Nestor and Paul Gere, who's our current commissioner.

1054
01:35:55,206 --> 01:36:01,689
[SPEAKER_21]: And thank you guys for meeting my individual needs, because I have always taken this job.

1055
01:36:01,769 --> 01:36:03,550
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, the big issues are going to be debated here.

1056
01:36:04,210 --> 01:36:12,594
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the one by one is how you build friendships, relationships, and how you build bonds that you'll have forever.

1057
01:36:13,274 --> 01:36:17,536
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor mocks Carol Bailey who was one of my closest friends over the years.

1058
01:36:17,696 --> 01:36:26,219
[SPEAKER_21]: I met her her son is in college now He's ready to graduate and I met her when Michael mocks called me because she had one of those funky streets in West Medford Hercroft Park.

1059
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:28,880
[SPEAKER_21]: It was the year Michael left the school committee

1060
01:36:29,512 --> 01:36:31,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Half of the street went to the Gleason School.

1061
01:36:31,613 --> 01:36:34,616
[SPEAKER_21]: If you live right next door, you went to the other school.

1062
01:36:35,116 --> 01:36:42,521
[SPEAKER_21]: And through Councilor Marks, I was able to build a bond by helping out Carol and her son remain at the Gleason School or get into the Gleason School.

1063
01:36:43,001 --> 01:36:49,066
[SPEAKER_21]: And one by one, that's how you build a good group, a good following behind you.

1064
01:36:49,546 --> 01:36:55,750
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just can't say enough about the DPW because they're great.

1065
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,632
[SPEAKER_21]: If we can get a hand for those guys because they really are.

1066
01:37:06,344 --> 01:37:09,265
[SPEAKER_21]: The last two people I just want to acknowledge.

1067
01:37:11,846 --> 01:37:12,446
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got the wife.

1068
01:37:14,647 --> 01:37:16,768
[SPEAKER_21]: You'll laugh, I've got to make sure, because I'll never hear the end of it.

1069
01:37:19,629 --> 01:37:21,670
[SPEAKER_21]: The last two people I'd like to acknowledge.

1070
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:28,313
[SPEAKER_21]: There's one other person that's retiring at the end of this year with Councilor Bob and myself, and that's Mayor Mike McGlynn.

1071
01:37:29,213 --> 01:37:33,475
[SPEAKER_21]: People seem to think that I've just got this rosy, great relationship with him.

1072
01:37:33,615 --> 01:37:36,116
[SPEAKER_21]: People don't realize how much we battle behind the closed doors.

1073
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:41,132
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, and even Councilor Pente, I think you'd say the same about Mike.

1074
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:46,556
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, you can battle and battle, but he always tried to do what's right for this community.

1075
01:37:47,376 --> 01:37:48,416
[SPEAKER_21]: He's been a great mayor.

1076
01:37:48,776 --> 01:37:49,097
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

1077
01:37:49,297 --> 01:37:54,098
[SPEAKER_21]: If he wasn't doing something right, he wouldn't be the mayor overwhelmingly for 28 consecutive years.

1078
01:37:54,638 --> 01:38:08,581
[SPEAKER_21]: So when you keep that into perspective, the man is retiring, the man's going to spend more time with his family, but I personally want to thank him for his years of service and the invaluable things he taught me over the years.

1079
01:38:09,061 --> 01:38:12,222
[SPEAKER_21]: So Mike McGlynn, good luck in your retirement as well if you're out there watching.

1080
01:38:12,662 --> 01:38:15,064
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, it's sort of like some of those old TV shows.

1081
01:38:15,104 --> 01:38:16,786
[SPEAKER_21]: No one watches, but everyone knows what's going on.

1082
01:38:17,126 --> 01:38:19,808
[SPEAKER_21]: He still says he never watches it, but I think he's full of it.

1083
01:38:19,828 --> 01:38:25,613
[SPEAKER_21]: I think he watches the council meetings, and he just says that, oh, I heard of this or that, but I think he's watching.

1084
01:38:25,633 --> 01:38:28,275
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you are watching, Mr. Mayor, you've done a hell of a job.

1085
01:38:28,315 --> 01:38:29,997
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been a good ride, and best of luck to you.

1086
01:38:38,041 --> 01:39:01,043
[SPEAKER_21]: The next individual and in the last individual that I just want to recognize this evening, you know There was a race for mayor in this community the first time in 28 years and that's a long time 28 years it was former mayor Parika And then it was mayor Mike McGlynn for 28 years and in the new mayor-elect, you know as I stated

1087
01:39:02,584 --> 01:39:06,585
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor-elect Burke has been a former member of this Medford City Council.

1088
01:39:07,185 --> 01:39:18,247
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know, I hope that I'm saying this, but you know, people say, well, when she went to the mayor's office, she didn't do this or wasn't responsive.

1089
01:39:18,287 --> 01:39:19,007
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know what?

1090
01:39:19,187 --> 01:39:21,728
[SPEAKER_21]: People got to understand, she worked for another individual.

1091
01:39:22,468 --> 01:39:26,309
[SPEAKER_21]: She worked for another individual that called all the shots in that office, you know?

1092
01:39:26,965 --> 01:39:29,768
[SPEAKER_21]: So I really think that this city is in good hands.

1093
01:39:30,248 --> 01:39:32,510
[SPEAKER_21]: As Councilor Penta said, there wasn't a mandate.

1094
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:35,052
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a very close election, but the people have spoken.

1095
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:40,957
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think this is the time that we all have to get behind the new administration and work to make Medford a better place.

1096
01:39:41,258 --> 01:39:41,818
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you know what?

1097
01:39:42,078 --> 01:39:47,403
[SPEAKER_21]: She's in a position now where she can make things happen and not being the director of budget and personnel.

1098
01:39:47,883 --> 01:39:50,826
[SPEAKER_21]: And, um, and for that, and last but not least, you know,

1099
01:39:51,222 --> 01:39:55,045
[SPEAKER_21]: During this campaign, I was able to spend a lot of time with her and her family.

1100
01:39:55,526 --> 01:39:59,349
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just got to see a side of them that I necessarily didn't over the years.

1101
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:11,519
[SPEAKER_21]: And other than my dad, my dad always loved her as a Councilor because she was sharp and she didn't speak all the time on every issue, but she knew the vote she was taking and was very smart.

1102
01:40:11,579 --> 01:40:13,261
[SPEAKER_21]: So I relied upon my dad's

1103
01:40:18,158 --> 01:40:23,343
[SPEAKER_21]: thoughts over the years, and Stephanie Burke, you're gonna be a hell of a mayor.

1104
01:40:23,604 --> 01:40:26,306
[SPEAKER_21]: I know you got big shoes to fill, but you know what?

1105
01:40:26,487 --> 01:40:34,234
[SPEAKER_21]: You surround yourself with good people, be open-minded, and just always doing the right thing, and this community's going to prosper.

1106
01:40:34,735 --> 01:40:37,277
[SPEAKER_21]: And for anyone out there that may think differently,

1107
01:40:38,078 --> 01:40:38,699
[SPEAKER_21]: Give her a shot.

1108
01:40:38,959 --> 01:40:41,602
[SPEAKER_21]: There's always two years from now, you can take a look or whatever.

1109
01:40:41,983 --> 01:40:47,770
[SPEAKER_21]: But I have the utmost faith in knowing her brains, her intelligence, and her compassion.

1110
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:50,112
[SPEAKER_21]: Because in this job as mayor, you know something?

1111
01:40:51,204 --> 01:40:52,205
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is very interesting.

1112
01:40:52,245 --> 01:40:59,692
[SPEAKER_21]: I admire the both candidates for mayor, because early on in the race, there were some things that made me ponder and say, I'm glad I didn't run for mayor.

1113
01:41:00,093 --> 01:41:06,339
[SPEAKER_21]: And that was when you had to make major personnel decisions based upon actions of people that may have did something within the community.

1114
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:12,144
[SPEAKER_21]: The mayor's office is a job that you're actually the CEO of a community.

1115
01:41:12,843 --> 01:41:20,188
[SPEAKER_21]: You're saying people may not have a job tomorrow based upon some of their actions or based upon circumstances.

1116
01:41:20,888 --> 01:41:27,072
[SPEAKER_21]: And so you need to be, you need to have a lot of different characteristics for that job.

1117
01:41:27,112 --> 01:41:31,815
[SPEAKER_21]: But Stephanie, I look forward to, and the mayor-elect is here this evening.

1118
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:33,417
[SPEAKER_21]: If you could please just take a bow.

1119
01:41:43,789 --> 01:41:48,972
[SPEAKER_21]: But I just want to thank everyone for being here.

1120
01:41:49,392 --> 01:41:53,574
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know she texted me 30 times before, because I had to go get flowers.

1121
01:41:53,634 --> 01:41:55,595
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'd like my son and my wife to come up here.

1122
01:41:56,135 --> 01:42:01,478
[SPEAKER_21]: And I got little flowers for you, Whole Foods, but Dorico McGlynn was closed.

1123
01:42:45,471 --> 01:42:46,352
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1124
01:42:46,412 --> 01:42:47,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, go ahead, ask the question.

1125
01:42:47,893 --> 01:42:48,553
[SPEAKER_21]: What did you just ask?

1126
01:42:48,594 --> 01:42:50,215
[SPEAKER_21]: I want you to know what I got him.

1127
01:42:51,095 --> 01:42:51,936
[SPEAKER_08]: What's in mine?

1128
01:42:51,956 --> 01:42:53,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Two more days.

1129
01:42:54,038 --> 01:42:54,798
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, two more days.

1130
01:42:54,838 --> 01:42:55,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Santa's coming.

1131
01:42:55,899 --> 01:42:58,581
[SPEAKER_21]: But on an all serious note, you know what?

1132
01:42:58,621 --> 01:42:59,682
[SPEAKER_21]: This has been a hell of a ride.

1133
01:43:00,262 --> 01:43:02,864
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just want to thank everyone for coming here this evening.

1134
01:43:04,413 --> 01:43:07,216
[SPEAKER_21]: for me just because this is what it's all about.

1135
01:43:07,256 --> 01:43:12,041
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, you look around this room and there's 150 years worth of family and everything else, right James?

1136
01:43:14,523 --> 01:43:21,230
[SPEAKER_21]: So God bless everyone and Merry Christmas and good luck to the new city council, the new school committee and the new mayor.

1137
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:24,974
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's move this city in the right direction and I'll be on the sidelines watching.

1138
01:43:49,126 --> 01:43:51,068
[SPEAKER_15]: on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

1139
01:43:51,568 --> 01:43:52,649
[SPEAKER_15]: One more thing too.

1140
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:54,611
[SPEAKER_21]: One last thing.

1141
01:43:56,112 --> 01:44:07,301
[SPEAKER_21]: After I got here and I put the people that helped me get here, it's the citizens of Medford, it's the citizens of Medford that I owe a big thank you to because without them, none of this would have been possible.

1142
01:44:07,361 --> 01:44:09,283
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you Medford and good night.

1143
01:44:14,692 --> 01:44:24,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Meeting is now in recess so we can do our presentations and enjoy two delicious cakes from Arthur's Pastry in South Medford.

1144
01:44:24,498 --> 01:44:24,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1145
02:10:02,868 --> 02:10:04,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Meeting will come back to order.

1146
02:10:17,772 --> 02:10:19,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Meeting will return to order.

1147
02:10:19,912 --> 02:10:21,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Silence in the gallery.

1148
02:10:21,033 --> 02:10:30,575
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-818 offered by Councilor Camuso be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Michael J. McGlynn on his retirement.

1149
02:10:31,036 --> 02:10:33,077
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Musil, all those in favor?

1150
02:10:33,097 --> 02:10:33,617
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1151
02:10:33,917 --> 02:10:34,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1152
02:10:34,577 --> 02:10:36,998
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-810 offered by Councilor Penta.

1153
02:10:37,398 --> 02:10:44,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Metro City Council go on record as supporting a city's senior citizen exemption from having to pay to park in our city.

1154
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:46,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Penta, where are you?

1155
02:10:46,221 --> 02:10:46,641
[SPEAKER_15]: There you are.

1156
02:10:46,661 --> 02:10:47,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of addressed that too, yeah.

1157
02:10:48,522 --> 02:10:48,822
[SPEAKER_15]: You on?

1158
02:10:49,222 --> 02:10:52,803
[SPEAKER_23]: As I said earlier this evening in some of my remarks, one of the things that

1159
02:10:53,714 --> 02:10:58,517
[SPEAKER_23]: seems to have been a concern during this past campaign was the parking in the square.

1160
02:10:59,078 --> 02:11:14,787
[SPEAKER_23]: But the incoming administration over and beyond the August questionnaire that was sent out and then the commitment that was made during this past campaign and one of the debates indicated that the administration would move for a senior citizen discount with Republic.

1161
02:11:15,267 --> 02:11:19,750
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would request that the council go on record to show the support for that as it relates to

1162
02:11:20,814 --> 02:11:26,396
[SPEAKER_23]: that for which had come up as a campaign issue and a commitment made by the incoming administration.

1163
02:11:26,676 --> 02:11:30,477
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion approved by Councilor Penta, Councilor Vice-President Mago-Kern.

1164
02:11:31,497 --> 02:11:31,837
[SPEAKER_15]: All set?

1165
02:11:32,097 --> 02:11:32,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I concur.

1166
02:11:33,337 --> 02:11:36,398
[SPEAKER_15]: As seconded by Vice-President Mago-Kern, all those in favor?

1167
02:11:36,418 --> 02:11:37,738
[SPEAKER_23]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

1168
02:11:37,778 --> 02:11:40,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1169
02:11:40,659 --> 02:11:43,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, Councilor Knight, if you would.

1170
02:11:44,273 --> 02:11:48,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Earlier this evening, we tabled a paper, a money paper, relative to the use of kiosks.

1171
02:11:48,734 --> 02:11:51,035
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're going to investigate that a little bit further in subcommittee.

1172
02:11:52,175 --> 02:12:04,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Audit and Budget Finance Subcommittee is going to take a look at whether or not the appropriation from the sale of real estate in the amount of $250,000 be transferred to be used for approvals to the five business districts, Mr. President.

1173
02:12:05,361 --> 02:12:16,191
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I certainly support an exemption for senior citizens having to pay and park in our city, but I think maybe we can take a look at this in a universal approach as opposed to as one item here, one item there, one item here, one item there.

1174
02:12:16,812 --> 02:12:17,733
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I defer to the body.

1175
02:12:18,694 --> 02:12:18,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Very good.

1176
02:12:20,278 --> 02:12:23,180
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, I would stick to the resolution.

1177
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:24,620
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a separate itemized issue.

1178
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:29,603
[SPEAKER_23]: It has makes no difference as it relates to what is going to be going forward with Louise Miller or anything else.

1179
02:12:29,643 --> 02:12:32,484
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a, it's an item that was used as a campaign issue.

1180
02:12:32,504 --> 02:12:33,965
[SPEAKER_23]: It was an item that was voted upon.

1181
02:12:34,025 --> 02:12:39,187
[SPEAKER_23]: It was an item that was campaigned on and it was an item committed upon by the incoming administration.

1182
02:12:39,727 --> 02:12:45,550
[SPEAKER_23]: So being isolated as it is and following forward with that, Mr. President, I think it would be a good way.

1183
02:12:45,870 --> 02:12:51,094
[SPEAKER_23]: and some good strength to have the incoming administration realize that the City Council supports that resolution.

1184
02:12:51,654 --> 02:12:53,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion of approval is on before us.

1185
02:12:54,536 --> 02:12:55,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1186
02:12:56,098 --> 02:12:56,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Camuso?

1187
02:12:57,158 --> 02:12:57,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1188
02:12:57,759 --> 02:12:58,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Cavill?

1189
02:12:58,399 --> 02:12:58,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1190
02:12:59,180 --> 02:12:59,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Monk?

1191
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:00,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1192
02:13:00,681 --> 02:13:01,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice-President Humlker?

1193
02:13:01,682 --> 02:13:01,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1194
02:13:02,282 --> 02:13:02,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks?

1195
02:13:03,003 --> 02:13:03,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1196
02:13:03,683 --> 02:13:04,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Packer?

1197
02:13:04,263 --> 02:13:04,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1198
02:13:05,124 --> 02:13:06,085
[SPEAKER_10]: President de la Ruche?

1199
02:13:06,165 --> 02:13:06,345
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1200
02:13:06,585 --> 02:13:08,887
[SPEAKER_15]: The vote is six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1201
02:13:09,367 --> 02:13:10,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1202
02:13:12,039 --> 02:13:27,097
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-811 offered by Councilor Penta be it resolved that many businesses and individuals who continuously and generously support and donate to all charities and people in need within our city be publicly acknowledged with a big thank you for their unselfish contributions.

1203
02:13:27,598 --> 02:13:30,902
[SPEAKER_15]: They truly helped to make without any public recognition.

1204
02:13:31,305 --> 02:13:36,391
[SPEAKER_15]: the Christmas season and at all times of the year, a better day for those in need.

1205
02:13:36,692 --> 02:13:38,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

1206
02:13:38,214 --> 02:13:48,186
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, unfortunately at this time of the year, individuals, some individuals get recognized for whatever their contributions might be, but there is a whole host of community folks, businesses,

1207
02:13:48,673 --> 02:13:54,358
[SPEAKER_23]: and individuals who contribute all during the year for the purposes of helping those who are in need.

1208
02:13:54,378 --> 02:14:01,444
[SPEAKER_23]: For example, you have one of the banks in the square, without mentioning them, has an annual thing for Toys for Tots.

1209
02:14:01,484 --> 02:14:06,028
[SPEAKER_23]: You have the Medford Fire Department, who has an ongoing Christmas season situation.

1210
02:14:06,408 --> 02:14:11,933
[SPEAKER_23]: But you have individual people who are philanthropic unto their own right, and they don't want any recognition at all, they just do it.

1211
02:14:12,453 --> 02:14:17,155
[SPEAKER_23]: So, it doesn't make any difference whether you're a private business, a union, an individual, whatever it might be.

1212
02:14:17,816 --> 02:14:31,802
[SPEAKER_23]: These people, to some degree, if they're watching, should know that their contributions are recognized and appreciated, and as a result of that, it's our little way of saying thank you to them for being supportive for people in need when not asked to do so.

1213
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:33,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Councilor.

1214
02:14:34,122 --> 02:14:36,385
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion approved by Councilor Penter, all those in favor?

1215
02:14:36,905 --> 02:14:37,506
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1216
02:14:37,546 --> 02:14:39,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1217
02:14:39,348 --> 02:14:44,555
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-812 offered by Councilor Penter, be it resolved that the recent Comcast cable bill be discussed.

1218
02:14:44,915 --> 02:14:45,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Did we just discuss this?

1219
02:14:46,978 --> 02:14:52,064
[SPEAKER_23]: No, it happened to come up in conversation, but the fact of the matter is in this recent monthly December bill,

1220
02:14:52,575 --> 02:14:55,456
[SPEAKER_23]: from Comcast, it'll show that it's going from $3.25 to $5.

1221
02:14:55,696 --> 02:14:58,496
[SPEAKER_23]: Now that's an increase of $1.75 a month.

1222
02:14:58,996 --> 02:15:09,598
[SPEAKER_23]: The city is presently sitting on over $450,000 of PEG access money, cable access monies, and as a result of that, still having no public access television here in the city of Medford.

1223
02:15:10,178 --> 02:15:13,319
[SPEAKER_23]: And the city's use of those monies to pay for salaries up at the high school.

1224
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:17,660
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's incumbent upon the incoming city council to make a demand

1225
02:15:18,097 --> 02:15:24,179
[SPEAKER_23]: from the incoming administration, whether, in fact, they are going to have cable, public access, TV3, whatever it might be.

1226
02:15:24,659 --> 02:15:42,944
[SPEAKER_23]: And there might be a twist to that, because I think if we have all been watching what's on the news lately, there's a movement afoot between Channel 7 to possibly take over, that for which Comcast has right now, which is Nessun, and I forget the other one, and WHCH.

1227
02:15:44,181 --> 02:16:09,175
[SPEAKER_23]: And with that being said, there is a possibility, if in fact this merger were to go through, and I think it would be the second highest, a multi-billion dollar merger, what could possibly happen as a movement, because if NBC does buy out the franchise, Anson, that they're looking to buy out, they could possibly retrieve the cable location of TV3 that we presently have.

1228
02:16:09,872 --> 02:16:10,973
[SPEAKER_23]: and put it in a different spot.

1229
02:16:11,253 --> 02:16:12,093
[SPEAKER_23]: That's okay, too.

1230
02:16:12,633 --> 02:16:25,920
[SPEAKER_23]: But in the contract, on page five, it says the following, PEG's access channels, any licensee-owned channels made available by the licensee in the situation as Comcast and provided for use for the presentations of PEG access programming.

1231
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:36,706
[SPEAKER_23]: So if, in fact, if you read the contract and if you follow what's going on in the news, that if, in fact, this were to take place, there's a possibility of one or two things that ANSEN, WHCH,

1232
02:16:38,803 --> 02:16:44,027
[SPEAKER_23]: could probably be bought out by NBC, and so wouldn't be Channel 6.

1233
02:16:45,688 --> 02:16:58,336
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a side issue as it relates to the main subject matter, which is public access television, but I really think you two guys coming on as new councilors, you really have to understand that if we're going to allow public access here in the city of Medford, it needs to be worked on.

1234
02:16:58,416 --> 02:17:05,981
[SPEAKER_23]: And now, having a $1.75 increase per month on a cable access bill that people would be paying each and every month, that's approximately $60 a year,

1235
02:17:07,517 --> 02:17:16,385
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a lot of money to people, you know, you take that it's another $60 and the Community Preservation Act It's another minimum of $165 as a rate increase.

1236
02:17:16,626 --> 02:17:29,818
[SPEAKER_23]: It's another 7% that's going to be taking place on your water and sewer tax bills coming out So it is going to have an effect and I I would suggest mr. President this Medford City Council go into some kind of remedial

1237
02:17:30,725 --> 02:17:42,814
[SPEAKER_23]: a discussion as it relates to, you know, what's going on, not only with the rate increase, but, you know, how and why the city can collect this money, charge up to $5, and still not allow cable access television to go forward.

1238
02:17:43,014 --> 02:17:54,523
[SPEAKER_23]: You may want to bring the city solicitor on board on this one here to find out if, in fact, with the great increase, can they still allow, can they still continue to allow not having public access, whether it be on Channel 3 or any other channel.

1239
02:17:55,669 --> 02:17:59,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you on the motion for approval, but I can put down a roll call vote so that we're there.

1240
02:17:59,252 --> 02:18:16,464
[SPEAKER_15]: It's forwarded to the city solicitor, let him review it for the new city council and be further amended that the matter be sent to the city solicitor regarding the increase in the rate of, uh, uh, uh, yeah, they can do that.

1241
02:18:16,604 --> 02:18:23,029
[SPEAKER_15]: The line item in the cable bills allocated towards, uh, uh, community access.

1242
02:18:24,298 --> 02:18:33,944
[SPEAKER_15]: there was a rate increase and what recourse the city has to end that and or what obligation we have to provide the service that people are paying for.

1243
02:18:34,970 --> 02:18:45,755
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a value also there, too, Mr. President, of I think it's $454 or $455 million is if WHTH goes off the year, which is sort of like a sweet pot of the deal to make this thing more attractive.

1244
02:18:46,356 --> 02:18:49,897
[SPEAKER_23]: But I think the city needs to get itself involved, especially because of public access.

1245
02:18:50,318 --> 02:19:02,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I wouldn't dare to recommend, but if you'd indulge me to suggest that this also be further amended to make this a priority of attention for the next administration.

1246
02:19:04,087 --> 02:19:06,828
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a amendment by Councilor Penta.

1247
02:19:07,248 --> 02:19:10,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk, at your discretion.

1248
02:19:11,329 --> 02:19:12,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1249
02:19:13,470 --> 02:19:14,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1250
02:19:14,610 --> 02:19:32,136
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh, it's a resolution that I offered back, I think two or three times now before the council back over the last, uh, 10 years is that, uh, there was a special home rule petition filed by this council that allowed, uh, us, uh, the city to take 5%

1251
02:19:33,648 --> 02:19:35,910
[SPEAKER_18]: of the cable money go up to five percent.

1252
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:40,753
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was a special vote of this council.

1253
02:19:41,294 --> 02:19:57,926
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've offered resolutions in the past for us to do away with that home rule petition because clearly we're not getting any response from the administration regarding this peg money and the lack of having public access in the community while we still accept funds from the ratepayers.

1254
02:19:58,747 --> 02:20:01,849
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know in my opinion if the administration who's the

1255
02:20:02,399 --> 02:20:12,847
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, authority on signing the contract is unwilling, uh, to discuss this issue that maybe we as the legislative body should, uh, file legislation to do away with the act.

1256
02:20:13,548 --> 02:20:15,529
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, I have the act of my desk somewhere.

1257
02:20:15,549 --> 02:20:26,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, I believe it was the act of 1980 or 83, uh, that created, uh, this, uh, uh, special vote of the council to allow it to take up to 5%.

1258
02:20:26,738 --> 02:20:27,599
[SPEAKER_18]: It went to 5%.

1259
02:20:27,679 --> 02:20:28,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

1260
02:20:31,005 --> 02:20:35,048
[SPEAKER_18]: which is a lion's share of the money for cable access, Mr. President.

1261
02:20:35,068 --> 02:20:40,531
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'm not adverse to going that angle if we're unable.

1262
02:20:40,872 --> 02:20:43,133
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe with the new administration, there'll be more cooperation.

1263
02:20:43,193 --> 02:20:45,875
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we've got to be resolved one way or another.

1264
02:20:46,095 --> 02:20:46,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1265
02:20:46,295 --> 02:20:48,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's unjust what we're doing to the people.

1266
02:20:48,096 --> 02:20:52,019
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's two years worth of unjust, and I'm not sure how much longer we want to wait.

1267
02:20:53,219 --> 02:20:53,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1268
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:54,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1269
02:20:56,482 --> 02:20:58,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Citizen, please state your name and address for the record.

1270
02:20:59,103 --> 02:21:00,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1271
02:21:00,306 --> 02:21:04,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street in Medford.

1272
02:21:05,199 --> 02:21:05,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Just really brief.

1273
02:21:08,968 --> 02:21:12,311
[SPEAKER_06]: We need the community access station for so many different things.

1274
02:21:12,371 --> 02:21:21,257
[SPEAKER_06]: It could help, you know, advertisements for the, for the five business districts for the arts and stuff going on, uh, Medford sports, things like that.

1275
02:21:21,838 --> 02:21:29,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, also politically speaking, we got a huge election year next year with state Senate and, uh, state house rep races.

1276
02:21:29,764 --> 02:21:32,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the presidential primary is on March 1st.

1277
02:21:32,946 --> 02:21:34,227
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a number of state committee,

1278
02:21:34,707 --> 02:21:38,831
[SPEAKER_06]: keep members up for election running from here from Medford, Medford candidates.

1279
02:21:39,732 --> 02:21:41,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make that statement.

1280
02:21:41,114 --> 02:21:47,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all the other things, too, that community access provides on, you know, how-to shows and things like that.

1281
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:49,602
[SPEAKER_06]: We really need to have it in the city.

1282
02:21:49,962 --> 02:21:55,648
[SPEAKER_06]: But my question to this body, Mr. President, through the chair is, as Councilor Penta mentioned,

1283
02:21:56,652 --> 02:21:58,534
[SPEAKER_06]: $450,000, that's almost a half a million dollars.

1284
02:21:58,894 --> 02:22:00,555
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens to this money?

1285
02:22:00,776 --> 02:22:01,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know?

1286
02:22:01,376 --> 02:22:02,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it put in a bank account?

1287
02:22:02,797 --> 02:22:04,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it getting interest?

1288
02:22:04,839 --> 02:22:08,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Is some of it paid out for some things?

1289
02:22:08,441 --> 02:22:12,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just unsure as to what happens to almost a half a million dollars.

1290
02:22:13,225 --> 02:22:14,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1291
02:22:14,326 --> 02:22:14,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir.

1292
02:22:17,789 --> 02:22:18,829
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a rhetorical question.

1293
02:22:19,250 --> 02:22:20,931
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval by Council Penta.

1294
02:22:20,971 --> 02:22:21,852
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a real question.

1295
02:22:21,932 --> 02:22:23,493
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't rhetorical.

1296
02:22:26,334 --> 02:22:31,478
[SPEAKER_23]: The first answer is that the $450,000 that's sitting there is that's for the PEG access money.

1297
02:22:31,498 --> 02:22:35,281
[SPEAKER_23]: So if, in fact, we had a public access studio, that money would go there.

1298
02:22:35,601 --> 02:22:37,943
[SPEAKER_23]: That only represents 2 percent.

1299
02:22:37,983 --> 02:22:39,184
[SPEAKER_23]: That's 3 percent.

1300
02:22:39,224 --> 02:22:49,111
[SPEAKER_23]: The other 2 percent goes into the general fund, and that money is being paid for employees up at the high school, which is a real question mark because there are some questions as to whether that's even legal or not.

1301
02:22:49,751 --> 02:22:53,894
[SPEAKER_23]: So 1 percent goes to the fire, 1 percent to the police, and 1 percent goes to public access.

1302
02:22:53,914 --> 02:22:54,575
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the PEG money.

1303
02:22:55,065 --> 02:22:56,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, counsel.

1304
02:22:56,267 --> 02:22:56,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1305
02:22:57,390 --> 02:22:58,292
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Citizen.

1306
02:22:58,853 --> 02:22:59,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1307
02:22:59,314 --> 02:23:00,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record, sir.

1308
02:23:01,117 --> 02:23:01,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1309
02:23:01,698 --> 02:23:04,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Council President Joseph Villalon, 59 Garfield Avenue.

1310
02:23:04,414 --> 02:23:09,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to look at my Verizon bill, because I wasn't aware of this raise in the Comcast bill.

1311
02:23:09,638 --> 02:23:11,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will look at the Verizon as well.

1312
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:16,362
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I have a separate issue coming up I'd like to table, Council President.

1313
02:23:17,243 --> 02:23:20,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It's separate from what Mr. Pinto was, Councilor Penta was talking about.

1314
02:23:20,906 --> 02:23:23,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to table it and bring it up for the first meeting of the year.

1315
02:23:24,568 --> 02:23:29,652
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about Comcast and these channels.

1316
02:23:29,852 --> 02:23:31,173
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I may do that.

1317
02:23:31,569 --> 02:23:34,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to table the petition I have coming up.

1318
02:23:34,711 --> 02:23:35,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1319
02:23:40,634 --> 02:23:44,156
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll take that as a request to withdraw the petition.

1320
02:23:45,877 --> 02:23:52,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Petition 15-814 at request of petitioner at the rail is withdrawn.

1321
02:23:53,822 --> 02:23:58,044
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Penta, roll call vote has been requested.

1322
02:23:58,084 --> 02:24:00,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

1323
02:24:04,489 --> 02:24:05,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Camuso?

1324
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:05,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1325
02:24:06,311 --> 02:24:07,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello?

1326
02:24:07,151 --> 02:24:07,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

1328
02:24:08,532 --> 02:24:08,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1329
02:24:09,533 --> 02:24:10,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

1330
02:24:10,454 --> 02:24:10,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1331
02:24:11,015 --> 02:24:11,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Martins?

1332
02:24:11,815 --> 02:24:12,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1333
02:24:12,356 --> 02:24:12,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Penta?

1334
02:24:13,036 --> 02:24:13,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1335
02:24:14,137 --> 02:24:14,778
[SPEAKER_10]: President De La Rosa?

1336
02:24:14,938 --> 02:24:15,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1337
02:24:15,338 --> 02:24:18,321
[SPEAKER_15]: With a vote of seven in affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

1338
02:24:18,341 --> 02:24:31,472
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-813 offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that the superintendent of schools report back as to what budget areas in what dollar amount has the school department saved money so far this year

1339
02:24:32,177 --> 02:24:35,898
[SPEAKER_15]: as he was referred to a most recent news story article.

1340
02:24:36,298 --> 02:24:36,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Penta.

1341
02:24:39,978 --> 02:24:40,319
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1342
02:24:40,579 --> 02:24:41,139
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm getting there.

1343
02:24:41,159 --> 02:24:41,759
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1344
02:24:41,779 --> 02:24:51,061
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. President, most recently in a newspaper story published by the local press on December 17th, superintendent Belson was quoted as saying that the district has saved money in multiple areas.

1345
02:24:51,501 --> 02:24:58,882
[SPEAKER_23]: So far this year, he said, it is also possible that the position will be filled by an employee who already works for this city.

1346
02:24:59,350 --> 02:25:05,796
[SPEAKER_23]: The position he's making reference to is the new public relations potential position that the school department is now being considering.

1347
02:25:06,336 --> 02:25:11,501
[SPEAKER_23]: But I'm more concerned about his first line basically saying the district has saved money in multiple areas so far this year.

1348
02:25:11,861 --> 02:25:20,369
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it would be important for the school committee as well as the city council to get a review back as to just what are those multiple areas.

1349
02:25:20,889 --> 02:25:25,193
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, I would just like to conclude by saying the following, whether it be this or anything else.

1350
02:25:25,688 --> 02:25:29,450
[SPEAKER_23]: We have asked for numerous occasions, and the council in the past has voted for it.

1351
02:25:29,490 --> 02:25:30,451
[SPEAKER_23]: It's never taken place.

1352
02:25:30,951 --> 02:25:33,073
[SPEAKER_23]: So maybe this new school administration will take place.

1353
02:25:33,553 --> 02:25:39,557
[SPEAKER_23]: But at a minimum, the city council and the school committee should meet at least twice a year for the purposes of reviewing their financial wherewithals.

1354
02:25:39,577 --> 02:25:54,847
[SPEAKER_23]: Because this is kind of like a little bit disturbing, that if, in fact, we have money in multiple areas, when you have teachers there that are begging in time for school supplies, we're looking for special ed teachers, we're looking for teacher assistants in some of the schools,

1355
02:25:55,627 --> 02:26:03,760
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're having all kinds of areas here, and whether you're for or against hiring a person at $85,000 a year to be a public relations person.

1356
02:26:04,529 --> 02:26:11,573
[SPEAKER_23]: I think the first thing that needs to be considered is the teacher in the classroom, the needs of the teacher in the classroom, and the students that they have to take care of.

1357
02:26:12,134 --> 02:26:25,742
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think Mr. Belson owes it to the entire community of Medford, the PTOs, the PTAs, and everything else involved, that if you have multiple areas for which the school committee should be apprised of, and if they were doing their homework, they would know where these areas and how much money there is.

1358
02:26:26,742 --> 02:26:29,204
[SPEAKER_23]: That would demand a report back to the city council.

1359
02:26:29,593 --> 02:26:35,174
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would move, Mr. President, on a roll call vote to the superintendent report back into what areas that money's coming from.

1360
02:26:35,714 --> 02:26:43,456
[SPEAKER_23]: And if it's not going to affect those areas that the money's coming out of, then what's the purpose of taking the money out?

1361
02:26:43,756 --> 02:26:46,557
[SPEAKER_23]: Why aren't you using that money to fill the positions in that area?

1362
02:26:47,277 --> 02:26:47,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1363
02:26:48,657 --> 02:26:50,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes the Vice President.

1364
02:26:50,778 --> 02:26:51,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1365
02:26:51,958 --> 02:26:53,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1366
02:26:53,658 --> 02:26:54,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1367
02:26:54,239 --> 02:26:56,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see where the savings was.

1368
02:26:56,873 --> 02:27:04,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if I could amend Councilor Penta just to ask some information with regards to the mayor's discretionary funding.

1369
02:27:04,458 --> 02:27:10,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a fund, it's labeled mayor's discretionary funding of school projects.

1370
02:27:10,702 --> 02:27:26,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I know $95,000 was taken out of that fund two weeks ago and just looking to see what the remaining balance is with regards to that discretionary fund and possibly what else has been taken out of that fund in the last two years.

1371
02:27:28,413 --> 02:27:30,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to see what the remaining balance is.

1372
02:27:31,595 --> 02:27:37,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know a number of things were voted on with regards to improvements in the schools.

1373
02:27:38,198 --> 02:27:58,149
[SPEAKER_04]: But within the last couple of weeks, since the council did speak out with regards to the new PR job that was implemented, I've received numerous calls and emails with regards to just lack of ink and printers, the state of the books at the high school, no raises for kindergarten aides,

1374
02:27:59,114 --> 02:28:14,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Teachers getting barely no money for school supplies, lack of art supplies, security, lack of security, custodial services, toilet paper at the high school, aids in the classroom, teachers not getting reimbursed for flood damage.

1375
02:28:14,917 --> 02:28:22,279
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just emails and people just want to stop and talk about the new position do keep coming in.

1376
02:28:22,399 --> 02:28:27,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to know what this discretionary funds for, how much is remaining in it, and

1377
02:28:29,959 --> 02:28:32,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Any information we can get on it would be very helpful.

1378
02:28:33,001 --> 02:28:33,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1379
02:28:34,582 --> 02:28:35,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1380
02:28:36,403 --> 02:28:43,488
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the President's motion of Councilor Camuso, Penta, as amended by Vice President Lagarde, Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

1381
02:28:44,069 --> 02:28:44,849
[SPEAKER_21]: Just one question.

1382
02:28:45,570 --> 02:28:46,390
[SPEAKER_21]: We say there was a flood.

1383
02:28:47,031 --> 02:28:50,053
[SPEAKER_21]: If so, what teachers were not reimbursed and where was this flood?

1384
02:28:51,554 --> 02:28:54,636
[SPEAKER_21]: In a flood at the Roberts and a flood at the McGlynn over the last two years.

1385
02:28:54,836 --> 02:28:55,256
[SPEAKER_21]: In specific.

1386
02:28:55,276 --> 02:28:58,899
[SPEAKER_21]: Do the teachers have not been reimbursed for their own personal money putting out there?

1387
02:28:59,219 --> 02:28:59,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1388
02:29:00,878 --> 02:29:02,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we should want to look into this.

1389
02:29:03,319 --> 02:29:08,162
[SPEAKER_21]: Can the council at least give us the names after so we can get the superintendent to look at this as soon as possible?

1390
02:29:08,542 --> 02:29:08,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1391
02:29:10,083 --> 02:29:14,245
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't want to say it on the floor, though, because obviously you don't want to throw the teachers out there.

1392
02:29:15,226 --> 02:29:16,526
[SPEAKER_21]: How many teachers in total on this?

1393
02:29:17,327 --> 02:29:19,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I know three that had damage.

1394
02:29:20,528 --> 02:29:21,709
[SPEAKER_21]: And when was this flood recently?

1395
02:29:23,630 --> 02:29:27,532
[SPEAKER_04]: One was six months ago, and one was a year, 14 months ago.

1396
02:29:29,392 --> 02:29:32,214
[SPEAKER_21]: The better question, too, is, I think, how is the building flooding?

1397
02:29:33,394 --> 02:29:33,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Pipes.

1398
02:29:33,874 --> 02:29:34,855
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the pipes are breaking.

1399
02:29:35,375 --> 02:29:42,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, if we could get the teachers' names and find out where the reimbursement is and for what type of things they're looking to get reimbursed on.

1400
02:29:42,999 --> 02:29:49,922
[SPEAKER_21]: Because obviously, if they're coming out of pocket for this stuff as a result of a maintenance issue, that's a problem.

1401
02:29:52,803 --> 02:29:53,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

1402
02:29:54,244 --> 02:29:55,585
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended by Councilor Camuso,

1403
02:29:57,368 --> 02:29:59,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

1404
02:29:59,849 --> 02:30:01,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1405
02:30:01,831 --> 02:30:02,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1406
02:30:02,911 --> 02:30:04,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, Jean Martin 10 coming street.

1407
02:30:05,052 --> 02:30:16,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, in the name of transparency, every single dollar that is extra that the superintendent of schools finds is should be open to scrutiny to our visibility.

1408
02:30:16,299 --> 02:30:18,460
[SPEAKER_12]: We should know that that money is there as a public.

1409
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:19,641
[SPEAKER_12]: That's our money.

1410
02:30:20,481 --> 02:30:21,282
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not his money.

1411
02:30:21,662 --> 02:30:22,623
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not the mayor's money.

1412
02:30:22,743 --> 02:30:23,303
[SPEAKER_12]: That's our money.

1413
02:30:23,778 --> 02:30:24,859
[SPEAKER_12]: So we should know about that.

1414
02:30:25,279 --> 02:30:30,624
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are two points, two different areas that you recognize.

1415
02:30:30,644 --> 02:30:32,986
[SPEAKER_12]: And the first being transparency.

1416
02:30:33,607 --> 02:30:37,250
[SPEAKER_12]: And what are they going to do with that money that they've saved?

1417
02:30:37,791 --> 02:30:39,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they going to put it into maintenance?

1418
02:30:39,132 --> 02:30:40,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they going to put it into ink supplies?

1419
02:30:41,334 --> 02:30:43,776
[SPEAKER_12]: What are they going to do with the extra money that they've saved?

1420
02:30:44,797 --> 02:30:49,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Secondly, the more important piece,

1421
02:30:50,571 --> 02:31:02,193
[SPEAKER_12]: is this is not $85,000 once, this is $85,000 a year for a salesman, a salesperson, to sell the concept of the schools.

1422
02:31:03,174 --> 02:31:04,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.

1423
02:31:05,094 --> 02:31:05,834
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a salesman.

1424
02:31:06,354 --> 02:31:10,055
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a high class word for, PR is a high class person.

1425
02:31:10,695 --> 02:31:17,177
[SPEAKER_12]: That could be a teacher in a classroom, that could be a cop, that could be a DPW worker.

1426
02:31:17,697 --> 02:31:18,017
[SPEAKER_12]: That's $85,000 a year.

1427
02:31:20,775 --> 02:31:22,675
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a whole person on the ground.

1428
02:31:22,735 --> 02:31:28,497
[SPEAKER_12]: We have, no offense, but we have too many supervisors and we don't have enough, you know, privates.

1429
02:31:28,777 --> 02:31:29,457
[SPEAKER_12]: We need workers.

1430
02:31:30,617 --> 02:31:34,638
[SPEAKER_12]: And $85,000, it's not once, it's every single year.

1431
02:31:35,258 --> 02:31:41,700
[SPEAKER_12]: And personally, I think that it's a little bit of finagle the bagel behind closed doors too.

1432
02:31:42,207 --> 02:31:44,008
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't want to bring out the dirty laundry.

1433
02:31:44,028 --> 02:31:44,549
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no need.

1434
02:31:46,450 --> 02:31:54,235
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to say that that's one full salary for a cop, a firefighter, a DPW worker, or a teacher.

1435
02:31:55,136 --> 02:32:00,759
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to put that towards a regular teacher, classroom teacher, then take the $85,000 and put it towards a teacher.

1436
02:32:01,820 --> 02:32:05,342
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no reason why we need somebody to sell the concept of schools.

1437
02:32:05,743 --> 02:32:07,724
[SPEAKER_12]: And also bringing up Mr. Caraviello's

1438
02:32:08,163 --> 02:32:09,204
[SPEAKER_12]: pet peeve with the maintenance.

1439
02:32:09,804 --> 02:32:15,108
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason why they were flooded is because we're not putting that $85,000 a year towards fixing those pipes.

1440
02:32:15,588 --> 02:32:18,650
[SPEAKER_12]: We need a maintenance schedule for all the buildings.

1441
02:32:19,351 --> 02:32:21,573
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's much bigger than $85,000 a year.

1442
02:32:21,773 --> 02:32:26,856
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will give you that, but it is a full scale salary for an employee for the city.

1443
02:32:27,156 --> 02:32:27,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1444
02:32:31,039 --> 02:32:35,302
[SPEAKER_15]: A motion for approval by Councilor Penta as amended motion to set.

1445
02:32:35,542 --> 02:32:36,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you want to speak ma'am?

1446
02:32:37,658 --> 02:32:39,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1447
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:41,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Messenger, would you assist with the microphone?

1448
02:32:55,693 --> 02:32:58,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeanette, but I can't give you my address over the television.

1449
02:32:58,234 --> 02:33:01,736
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not safe for me, so I can tell the gentleman afterwards.

1450
02:33:04,738 --> 02:33:13,783
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many people here at the table have been educators, but I have and am an educator in special education.

1451
02:33:14,704 --> 02:33:22,428
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that while I appreciate the desire to look at the

1452
02:33:24,666 --> 02:33:31,248
[SPEAKER_00]: news article that was, you know, currently published about a position being created for somebody in the public school system.

1453
02:33:32,428 --> 02:33:51,034
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time that I've heard the schools being brought up at this meeting, and I think that what's more important than this one position, which clearly, if Medford public schools are not being adequately taken care of, they need a public relations person.

1454
02:33:52,512 --> 02:33:59,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly they need somebody who can answer the phone calls because there's been a flood and a bunch of people haven't been, their classrooms haven't been taken care of.

1455
02:34:00,538 --> 02:34:02,519
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see why they would want that position.

1456
02:34:03,700 --> 02:34:05,642
[SPEAKER_00]: That salary would not go to one teacher.

1457
02:34:06,342 --> 02:34:10,105
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is a salary, it would go to two because teachers aren't paid that much.

1458
02:34:11,106 --> 02:34:19,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as reimbursement for materials during a flood, teachers are never reimbursed, are very rarely reimbursed.

1459
02:34:20,416 --> 02:34:22,958
[SPEAKER_00]: for the money they spend on classroom materials.

1460
02:34:24,199 --> 02:34:35,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love, and this came up a little bit during the mayoral debates, but not much, I would love to see city council more involved in the new year, in the new administration, with the school board.

1461
02:34:37,170 --> 02:34:43,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Budgets for the school really don't go before city council, they go before the school board.

1462
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:46,558
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that works, that's why we elect a school board.

1463
02:34:47,739 --> 02:34:49,120
[SPEAKER_00]: And this position itself,

1464
02:34:50,727 --> 02:34:54,348
[SPEAKER_00]: should have gone before the school board, not city council.

1465
02:34:54,408 --> 02:34:59,369
[SPEAKER_00]: That's generally how the handling of schools in a public district work.

1466
02:35:00,310 --> 02:35:13,413
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's appreciable to bring up a hot-button news topic about a salary for somebody, I would like to see city councilmen and women talk about more

1467
02:35:14,883 --> 02:35:19,005
[SPEAKER_00]: How to support the districts and how to support the school committee.

1468
02:35:19,565 --> 02:35:22,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that clearly is the bigger issue here.

1469
02:35:22,586 --> 02:35:23,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1470
02:35:30,429 --> 02:35:30,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1471
02:35:32,630 --> 02:35:37,111
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion for, you requested to sever the amendments.

1472
02:35:37,771 --> 02:35:41,693
[SPEAKER_15]: So the severed amendments are requests by Councilor Camuso.

1473
02:35:45,145 --> 02:35:49,287
[SPEAKER_15]: why the teachers, and the circumstances of the flooding.

1474
02:35:50,208 --> 02:35:53,489
[SPEAKER_15]: And yours was, Madam Vice President, if you could remind me.

1475
02:35:54,450 --> 02:35:55,410
[SPEAKER_10]: The balance of the discretionary fund.

1476
02:35:55,811 --> 02:35:57,311
[SPEAKER_15]: The balance of the discretionary fund.

1477
02:35:58,132 --> 02:36:07,117
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're gonna sever those, so we take, so the two separate, you're moving to have the two amendments voted on separately from the main motion?

1478
02:36:08,477 --> 02:36:13,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so on, a roll call is requested on the separate amendments,

1479
02:36:13,833 --> 02:36:16,015
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll take Councilor Camuso's amendment first.

1480
02:36:17,256 --> 02:36:18,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1481
02:36:18,396 --> 02:36:21,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, just if I can clarify.

1482
02:36:21,839 --> 02:36:22,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of clarification.

1483
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:31,166
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm not mistaken, I think Councilor Longo mentioned the account, the discretionary account, and also you wanted to see for the past two years.

1484
02:36:31,606 --> 02:36:32,207
[SPEAKER_18]: What's been spent.

1485
02:36:32,387 --> 02:36:33,047
[SPEAKER_18]: What's been spent.

1486
02:36:33,087 --> 02:36:34,308
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's two parts to that.

1487
02:36:34,608 --> 02:36:34,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1488
02:36:36,009 --> 02:36:38,631
[SPEAKER_23]: And then my amendment too.

1489
02:36:38,651 --> 02:36:38,771
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

1490
02:36:39,252 --> 02:36:41,173
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're separating all three.

1491
02:36:42,174 --> 02:36:43,235
[SPEAKER_15]: So the first one.

1492
02:36:44,404 --> 02:36:44,584

02:36:45,384 --> 02:36:48,925

[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1509
02:37:05,828 --> 02:37:08,928
[SPEAKER_15]: The vote of six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1510
02:37:09,368 --> 02:37:10,229
[SPEAKER_15]: The amendment passes.

1511
02:37:11,389 --> 02:37:12,669
[SPEAKER_15]: First amendment offered by,

1512
02:37:13,193 --> 02:37:14,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Lago-Kern.

1513
02:37:16,196 --> 02:37:16,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk.

1514
02:37:18,018 --> 02:37:20,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Before the roll is called, Councilor Camuso.

1515
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:23,263
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd just like to explain my next vote before it's called.

1516
02:37:23,563 --> 02:37:29,869
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to support the amendment on the discretionary funding, but on the main motion, I believe that's a school committee issue.

1517
02:37:30,130 --> 02:37:37,537
[SPEAKER_21]: The money was appropriated as an aggregate amount for the Medford school committee to spend under their wise, um, um,

1518
02:37:38,643 --> 02:37:42,485
[SPEAKER_21]: vote or not so wise vote, whatever it was, but it was a budget that was passed in June.

1519
02:37:42,966 --> 02:37:47,629
[SPEAKER_21]: So, uh, I'm going to leave this as a school committee may issue similar to what the young lady stated.

1520
02:37:48,309 --> 02:38:01,918
[SPEAKER_21]: So I will be voting no on that, but the discretionary funding I'm going to vote yes on because that's a funding that we have not seen at any point where the mayor it's mitigation or from his golf tournament or it's from some other funding source.

1521
02:38:03,999 --> 02:38:05,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1522

[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Naik?

1527
02:38:16,237 --> 02:38:16,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1528
02:38:17,278 --> 02:38:18,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice-President Walker?

1529
02:38:18,138 --> 02:38:18,218

02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:21,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1534
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:22,561

02:38:26,543 --> 02:38:27,383
[SPEAKER_15]: The amendment passes.

1538
02:38:27,423 --> 02:38:29,524
[SPEAKER_15]: And finally, to the main motion of Councilor Penta, 15.813.

1539
02:38:29,925 --> 02:38:32,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

02:38:40,869 --> 02:38:41,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

02:38:41,530 --> 02:38:41,690
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1550
02:38:42,670 --> 02:38:43,611

[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1558
02:38:49,375 --> 02:38:51,296
[SPEAKER_15]: With a vote of six in the affirmative, one negative.

1559
02:38:51,316 --> 02:38:53,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Five, five, five.

1560
02:38:53,738 --> 02:38:55,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I apologize.

1561
02:38:55,719 --> 02:38:57,020
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a map challenge.

1562
02:38:57,580 --> 02:38:59,482

02:39:28,186 --> 02:39:32,368
[SPEAKER_15]: 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford Mass, for vetting of the Muccini-Burke transition team.

1568
02:39:33,809 --> 02:39:39,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilors, Mr. Petitioner, I find this as a matter not pertinent to the Medford City Council.

1569
02:39:40,113 --> 02:39:44,615
[SPEAKER_15]: The transition team is not a government-appointed body.

1570
02:39:45,035 --> 02:39:51,059
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a matter for consideration of the Medford City Council, so I find this matter out of order.

1571
02:39:56,370 --> 02:39:57,951
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to declare this out of order.

1572
02:40:00,173 --> 02:40:01,294
[SPEAKER_15]: I rule it out of order.

1573
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:11,081
[SPEAKER_15]: I've made a ruling.

1574
02:40:11,141 --> 02:40:11,841
[SPEAKER_15]: It's out of order.

1575
02:40:13,523 --> 02:40:14,704
[SPEAKER_15]: It's out of order, sir.

1576
02:40:14,784 --> 02:40:15,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1577
02:40:18,306 --> 02:40:18,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, sir.

1578
02:40:22,129 --> 02:40:23,670
[SPEAKER_15]: The chair has been challenged.

1579
02:40:23,910 --> 02:40:26,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1580

[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, these two officers were the first to respond this fire on main street and, um, doing what comes naturally to them and their heroic efforts.

[SPEAKER_03]: They would, they went into the building, rescued those two children and helped the mother and the dog get off of safety.

1592
02:42:25,611 --> 02:42:27,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I don't know what to say.

1593
02:42:27,993 --> 02:42:28,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh,

1594
02:42:29,191 --> 02:42:31,294
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, about these two fine people.

1595
02:42:31,654 --> 02:42:36,860
[SPEAKER_03]: They do what they do best, and thank you to them for their fine service.

1596
02:42:38,422 --> 02:42:46,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And, Mr. President, if we could have them come down after the first of the year, maybe a commendation with the family that they rescued would be appreciated.

1597
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1598
02:43:07,851 --> 02:43:10,073
[SPEAKER_23]: And the folks were very appreciative of the fact.

1599
02:43:10,133 --> 02:43:13,035
[SPEAKER_23]: And as a result of that, I think we're all appreciative of the fact.

1600
02:43:13,115 --> 02:43:21,781
[SPEAKER_23]: And it would be nice to have the chief of police down here to also make public commendation recommendations as it relates to their activity.

1601
02:43:22,161 --> 02:43:23,922
[SPEAKER_23]: So on that, I move, Mr. President.

1602
02:43:24,062 --> 02:43:26,084
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like to be invited when they come down for that one, okay?

1603
02:43:27,064 --> 02:43:30,907
[SPEAKER_15]: To great police officers, great representatives of the Metro Police Department.

1604
02:43:31,633 --> 02:43:37,255

1608
02:44:02,763 --> 02:44:03,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1609
02:44:03,583 --> 02:44:09,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I want to thank Mr. Kamara for his nine years of diligent work as the water commissioner chairman.

1610
02:44:09,848 --> 02:44:16,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was a thankless job, and he worked hours upon hours upon that with the rest of his committee members.

1611
02:44:16,892 --> 02:44:28,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I wish him well in his retirement, and hopefully, maybe the new administration may be able to bring him back out of retirement to come back on the commission.

1612
02:44:31,578 --> 02:44:37,822
[SPEAKER_15]: I was hoping he'd come here tonight and sing with the chorale that was here, but unfortunately he couldn't make it.

1613
02:44:37,842 --> 02:44:42,205
[SPEAKER_15]: So on motion of approval by Councilor Caraviello, all those, did you want to speak?

1614
02:44:42,745 --> 02:44:43,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor, I apologize.

1615
02:44:43,726 --> 02:44:46,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1616
02:44:46,968 --> 02:44:55,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to take a brief moment to thank Mr. Kamara for his service to the city of Medford, not only as a member of the Water Commission, but also as a school teacher.

1617
02:44:55,634 --> 02:44:59,036
[SPEAKER_11]: I think many of us behind the rail that graduated from Medford High had the opportunity to

1618
02:44:59,523 --> 02:45:09,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I learned a lot from Mr. Camara, and when I became a member of this council, Mr. President, I certainly learned a lot from Mr. Camara relative to how a water and sewer operations work.

1619
02:45:09,766 --> 02:45:17,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would like to congratulate Councilor Caraviello for putting this resolution on and commend Mr. Camara for his service to the city of Medford.

1620
02:45:18,849 --> 02:45:19,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1621
02:45:19,850 --> 02:45:21,710
[SPEAKER_15]: And thank you, Councilor Knight.

1622
02:45:22,010 --> 02:45:23,611
[SPEAKER_15]: And Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1623
02:45:24,191 --> 02:45:25,191
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1624
02:45:25,231 --> 02:45:26,852
[SPEAKER_18]: And I do want to thank Councilor Caraviello.

1625
02:45:27,917 --> 02:45:34,121
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Kamara served with distinction for a number of years on a very tough commission in this community.

1626
02:45:34,982 --> 02:45:45,468
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, people don't know this, but when Dominick first came on the Water and Sewer Commission, the water system was in terrible disarray.

1627
02:45:45,888 --> 02:45:49,290
[SPEAKER_18]: It was in budget deficit, millions of dollars in budget deficit for years.

1628
02:45:50,351 --> 02:45:56,535
[SPEAKER_18]: The city underwent its largest remetering program when we changed all the water meters throughout the whole city.

1629
02:45:56,962 --> 02:46:01,184
[SPEAKER_18]: which was a giant project that Dominic was the chairman of.

1630
02:46:01,705 --> 02:46:10,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, the tiered system that took place recently and the second water meter outside was under his tutelage as chairman.

1631
02:46:11,370 --> 02:46:12,971
[SPEAKER_18]: And the abatements.

1632
02:46:13,911 --> 02:46:26,498
[SPEAKER_18]: I can remember the days going back five, six, seven, eight years ago where there was a laundry list of people that were looking for abatements because their water and sewer bill wasn't accurate because of outdated and old meters and so forth.

1633
02:46:27,220 --> 02:46:33,443
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was under the leadership of Mr. Kamara that the Water and Sewer Department really turned about.

1634
02:46:34,023 --> 02:46:43,086
[SPEAKER_18]: And now we're experiencing multimillion dollars in surpluses and very few abatements because of a system that's functioning properly.

1635
02:46:43,586 --> 02:46:50,109
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to thank him for his nine years of service, Mr. President, on a very difficult committee.

1636
02:46:50,709 --> 02:46:52,490
[SPEAKER_18]: And I look forward to seeing him around the community.

1637
02:46:53,133 --> 02:46:53,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1638
02:46:53,633 --> 02:47:00,578
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion for approval by uh, councilor calf yellow, all those in Oh, councilor Camuso, did you want to speak?

1639
02:47:00,918 --> 02:47:01,098
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1640
02:47:01,118 --> 02:47:01,819
[SPEAKER_21]: I apologize.

1641
02:47:02,019 --> 02:47:06,322
[SPEAKER_21]: This will probably be my last speech at the city council, but who knows?

1642
02:47:07,843 --> 02:47:08,183
[SPEAKER_21]: Who knows?

1643
02:47:08,203 --> 02:47:09,904
[SPEAKER_21]: We get a few minutes left.

1644
02:47:10,585 --> 02:47:12,806
[SPEAKER_21]: Certainly this is a good one to end on as a method.

1645
02:47:12,846 --> 02:47:19,571
[SPEAKER_21]: City council, Dom Camara is just a gentleman and um, served the citizens of Medford as a school teacher.

1646
02:47:20,035 --> 02:47:21,836
[SPEAKER_21]: with dignity over the years.

1647
02:47:22,477 --> 02:47:26,799
[SPEAKER_21]: And rather than retire, he took on another role post-retirement.

1648
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:32,203
[SPEAKER_21]: So I want to wish him well and thank him for his years of service as a commissioner.

1649
02:47:32,323 --> 02:47:37,807
[SPEAKER_21]: As Councilor Mark stated, it's a job that you go into the meeting and you get yelled at and this and that.

1650
02:47:37,907 --> 02:47:41,289
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a thankless job, but a lot of work went into it.

1651
02:47:42,670 --> 02:47:43,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1652
02:47:43,850 --> 02:47:45,732
[SPEAKER_15]: So a motion to approve by Councilor Caraviello.

1653
02:47:45,772 --> 02:47:46,512
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

02:47:47,153 --> 02:47:47,833
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1655
02:47:48,153 --> 02:47:48,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

[SPEAKER_15]: Finally, offered by Councilor Camuso, 15-820, be it resolved that the Medford City Council sends its sincere condolences to the family of Phyllis Makowski, who passed away recently.

1657
02:48:01,139 --> 02:48:05,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Makowski is the mother of Medford Police Department Detective Paul Makowski.

1658
02:48:09,265 --> 02:48:12,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Please join me and stand for a moment of silence for Mrs. Makowski.

1659

[SPEAKER_15]: the tabled records of the meeting of December 8th, 2015, the Feast of the Magical Conception, will pass to Councilor Marks.

1660
02:48:35,139 --> 02:48:39,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Sprooks, did you have the opportunity to inspect those records?

1661
02:48:39,182 --> 02:48:43,185
[SPEAKER_18]: I had ample opportunity to review the records and found it to be in order to move approval.

1662
02:48:43,586 --> 02:48:44,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1663
02:48:44,266 --> 02:48:50,031
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor Marks to approve those records, all those in favor?

1664
02:48:50,711 --> 02:48:51,452
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1665
02:48:51,792 --> 02:48:52,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1666
02:48:52,593 --> 02:48:57,577
[SPEAKER_15]: The records of the meeting of December 15th, 2015 will pass to Councilor Knight.

1667
02:48:58,213 --> 02:48:59,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor, how do you find those records?

1668
02:48:59,975 --> 02:49:03,700
[SPEAKER_11]: I had an opportunity to review the records and I find them in order.

1669
02:49:04,101 --> 02:49:04,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Move for approval.

1670
02:49:05,182 --> 02:49:11,169
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of approval for those records of the meeting of September 15th by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1671
02:49:12,031 --> 02:49:12,912
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1672
02:49:14,033 --> 02:49:14,714
[SPEAKER_15]: I have it.

1673
02:49:15,395 --> 02:49:17,977
[SPEAKER_15]: The ayes have it, the records are approved.

1674
02:49:18,357 --> 02:49:23,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Before we adjourn, there's a citizen at the podium who wishes to bid us Christmas greetings.

1675
02:49:24,022 --> 02:49:24,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1676
02:49:24,402 --> 02:49:25,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1677
02:49:25,843 --> 02:49:27,604
[SPEAKER_05]: You must be psychic, Councilor Dello Russo.

1678
02:49:28,725 --> 02:49:31,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1679
02:49:32,248 --> 02:49:33,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry I'm late.

1680
02:49:33,929 --> 02:49:37,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to go to awake my brother-in-law.

1681
02:49:37,692 --> 02:49:41,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to say goodbye to some of these Councilors and mayors

1682
02:49:41,874 --> 02:49:47,876
[SPEAKER_05]: And I apologize again, but I see Mr. Camuso's, Councilor Camuso.

1683
02:49:48,516 --> 02:49:56,679
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not here, but I jokingly used to call him Mayor Curley, and I think he's done a great job.

1684
02:49:57,159 --> 02:49:58,580
[SPEAKER_05]: He's done quite well for himself.

1685
02:49:58,720 --> 02:50:03,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I may say, I believe he's a definite overachiever.

1686
02:50:03,362 --> 02:50:08,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I congratulate him and wish him well in his future endeavors, as I wish everyone well.

1687
02:50:08,924 --> 02:50:09,844
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a wonderful life.

1688
02:50:11,382 --> 02:50:22,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I'd be remiss not to mention a fond farewell to the outgoing mayor, Michael, for he did do a lot of good things for our city of Medford on the Mystic River.

1689
02:50:25,826 --> 02:50:31,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And third, Councilor Penta of 30-something plus years.

1690
02:50:32,548 --> 02:50:32,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Six?

1691
02:50:33,908 --> 02:50:34,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1692
02:50:38,669 --> 02:50:40,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I never ever heard any politician

1693
02:50:41,875 --> 02:50:44,537
[SPEAKER_05]: seem to care for the people as you.

1694
02:50:46,359 --> 02:50:50,642
[SPEAKER_05]: And we thank you for your many amendments.

1695
02:50:55,286 --> 02:50:56,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

1696
02:50:57,928 --> 02:51:06,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And we thank you, Councilor Panther, for your many amendments that alleviated some of our tax increases.

1697
02:51:08,117 --> 02:51:18,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And although I never received any yes votes in my quest to lower our real estate taxes, we always knew where you stood on all issues.

1698
02:51:21,968 --> 02:51:33,357
[SPEAKER_05]: On many occasions here at the public forum, it's been stated that we Councilors have no power under this plan A government.

1699
02:51:34,088 --> 02:51:49,196
[SPEAKER_05]: With that being said, maybe it's high time for you, Mr. Robert M. Penta, to join us, we the people, on this side of the rail and hopefully achieve your greatest accomplishments for the people and make Method great again.

1700
02:51:49,216 --> 02:51:53,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1701
02:51:53,059 --> 02:51:55,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll strike that.

1702
02:51:59,772 --> 02:52:09,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's all work together with the new mayor and 57,000 population in Medford and make it a great year and to all a good night.

1703
02:52:10,905 --> 02:52:11,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Merry Christmas.

1704
02:52:12,086 --> 02:52:12,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Merry Christmas.

1705
02:52:13,207 --> 02:52:13,548

02:52:13,588 --> 02:52:14,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Merry Christmas.
