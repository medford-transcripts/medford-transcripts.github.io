    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=428.733s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=429.994s">Um,</a>  this is a request by the mayor, um, as a result of a commitment that was made to the Medford business groups in the five different business districts for, um, going forward capital improvements to the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=445.742s">Um,</a>  the first installment of $250,000 is being funded through the sale of real estate account. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=452.925s">And</a>  in years going forward to the extent that funds are available, it will be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=457.666s">Um,</a>  we anticipate with additional revenue, which will be going into the general fund, um, but from parking revenue.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=467.07s">And</a>  if I may point out that this was at the, uh, request of the city council.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=472.692s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=473.212s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=476.56s">On</a>  Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=478.541s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=480.182s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=480.382s">Miller,</a>  do we have an expected total budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=484.123s">You</a>  said the coming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=485.064s">Is</a>  this going to be $250,000 a year?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=487.625s">That</a>  is my understanding, is that if the funds are available, that it would be on a $250,000 a year basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=496.149s">It</a>  will be part of the operating budget.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=500.03s">And</a>  if I understood correctly, the new mayor will then <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=504.413s">establish</a>  an advisory committee on the disposition of those funds?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=508.137s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=509.878s">Can</a>  you give us some examples maybe of what will be done with the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=513.442s">It</a>  has to be used for capital improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=515.804s">So,</a>  you know, improvements to the sidewalks, perhaps improvements to lighting, lane markings, you know, anything of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=527.094s">Trees</a>  even?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=529.75s">So</a>  it's going to come upon the recommendation of the committee from made up of business men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=534.652s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=535.432s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=535.692s">Spend</a>  the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=536.213s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=542.275s">On</a>  the motion of council caviar for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=544.176s">Do</a>  I have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=546.196s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=547.337s">Uh,</a>  Camuso, all those in favor, if I may, if I may, if we could call is requested, uh, required. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=553.359s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=554.02s">Madam</a>  vice president.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=555.39s">just</a>  because it's almost a random $250,000 figure, if we could get an update, um, maybe at year's end every year of what the money's been spent on and how much has been used out of that two 50 versus how much is remaining just so we can have an idea of how to fund it each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=571.4s">Um,</a>  I just feel like kind of don't know where the two 50 came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=576.504s">So</a>  want to make sure that we budgeted correctly each year and are spending it, um, accordingly and the way it should be spent obviously.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=586.574s">So</a>  on the, uh, motion for approval, uh, by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by councilor Camuso as amended by vice president Lungo-Koehn, uh, Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=597.462s">Why</a>  couldn't that money be incorporated as part of the office of community development who was desperately in need of folks to have a professional consultant come in as we talked about before? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=607.155s">just</a>  taking $250,000 and spending it randomly at five squares doesn't make as much sense as having a paid professional and here's where the money could come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=616.041s">It</a>  would even have to come out of the city's budget and you would have a working operating capital to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=620.985s">I</a>  mean, the city is in desperate need of getting good professional people and I think this would be a better way to spend the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=627.669s">If</a>  I would use the money to be spent, that's what I would go because <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=630.622s">You</a>  need a professional person who's going to be able to tell you what's wrong, why these squares are not multiplying. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=635.828s">Just</a>  to correct the sidewalk or plant a tree or do a window or put a facade, that doesn't still help the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=641.695s">And</a>  I think what you really need is a hardcore look and a reality check as to why these businesses aren't multiplying or doing as good as they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=649.275s">So</a>  I would like to amend this to go one step further that that money be considered for the purposes of having a paid professional consultant be incorporated into the office of community development for the purposes of business development for the entire five squares in the city of method.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=663.907s">So</a>  that's an amendment by Councilor Penta that a consideration be given to using this money towards the hiring of a business development specialist in the office of community development.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=676.056s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=677.638s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=678.294s">because</a>  the money is from the sale of this particular year, the money is from sale of real estate, the money must be used, this initial $250,000 for capital improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=688.84s">Sale</a>  of real estate funds cannot be used for a salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=693.663s">And</a>  that's just for this particular year.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=697.125s">Well,</a>  when this first came up, Mr. President, when they were talking about the $250,000 and there wasn't a definition on how this money was going to be spent, there was nothing that required the fact <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=706.337s">you</a>  know, you couldn't use it for salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=707.778s">Now</a>  you're putting a requirement on it that wasn't there in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=711.101s">And</a>  that right there in and of itself is just, you know, it's, it's stifling the whole idea of moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=717.847s">Why</a>  can't this money just be put on hold until next year and then incorporate into next year's budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=722.571s">If</a>  it's an, if it's an, if you're telling me if it's into the real estate account, why can't it just go into the real estate account and become effective January 1st when the city council, the then city council can make its recommendation.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=733.05s">The</a>  sale of real estate account can only be used for capital improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=736.071s">So</a>  that's all that I was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=738.452s">So</a>  no matter when those funds are expended, there are currently $470,000, $407,000 in that fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=745.915s">Those</a>  funds can only be used for capital.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=747.975s">But</a>  why is it going into the real estate account? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=749.836s">Why</a>  can't it go to free cash?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=752.797s">That</a>  is the way the paper was written by the mayor and is being proposed to you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=757.879s">This</a>  is being, where does it say that Louise?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=761.822s">That</a>  what?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=762.502s">That's</a>  a 250 has to go into the real estate account.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=765.044s">It</a>  says, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=766.264s">I</a>  respectfully request and recommend that the sum of $250,000 be transferred from sale of real estate.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=771.627s">But</a>  that doesn't mean that the council can make a subsequent request to send it to free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=776.029s">I</a>  would move amend the motion that it'd be sent to free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=778.231s">That</a>  way the, the incoming council can have a better intelligent way of learning how to spend the money.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=787.375s">We'll</a>  have to do as a beep paper because it's contradictory to the main motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=790.417s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=793.313s">Uh,</a>  chair recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=796.335s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=797.615s">Louise,</a>  how is, uh, the representative of each business district going to be selected?</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=803.618s">I</a>  actually do not know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=805.659s">Um,</a>  I assume, or I shouldn't assume, but I believe it's going to be the mayor selecting a representative from each of the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=813.283s">But</a>  I do not know that for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=814.924s">The</a>  new mayor will have to determine that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=816.525s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=819.74s">Mr.</a>  President, with all due respect, I think at this point, I would ask that we lay it on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=826.343s">There</a>  are a lot of unanswered questions on this particular proposal, and I think it warrants more discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=835.167s">And,</a>  you know, we may look at having $250,000, a quarter of a million dollars, spent to improve communication between the Chamber of Commerce and the City of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=847.938s">We</a>  may choose to spend the $250,000 to promote small business to come back into our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=855.239s">There</a>  may be a number of initiatives rather than saying every business district will get $50,000 and go off and do what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=861.96s">And</a>  maybe it would be worthwhile to, you know, have us as a community look at the larger picture rather than break us into five separate business segments and say, what can we use with a quarter of a million dollars? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=875.743s">And</a>  it's not just for the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=877.439s">It's</a>  the second, it's the third, and the fourth. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=879.947s">And</a>  by year four, you're talking a million dollars, and this is not chump change. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=884.99s">And,</a>  uh, I, I think, uh, we're better off. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=887.992s">We</a>  have an economic development subcommittee that we refer this to the economic development subcommittee, find out who these five representatives are, uh, or maybe there's more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=898.937s">Uh,</a>  meet with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=899.998s">Let</a>  us hear what their needs are because this clearly states to us, it says, uh, the business district will recommend to the new mayor, some proposed uses that doesn't say the mayor is going to implement them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=910.283s">It</a>  doesn't say the mayor is going to act upon them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=912.637s">It</a>  doesn't say anything other than they're just going to recommend uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=916.859s">And,</a>  um, you know, I'd like to see a little more than, uh, what we have in front of us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=921.12s">So</a>  I would ask that this be sent to the subcommittee on economic, uh, uh, development.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=927.302s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=927.623s">So</a>  that's also, uh, contradictory to the motion that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=932.304s">So</a>  may we do that as a seat paper?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=938.191s">If</a>  you want, we could do a motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=940.473s">It</a>  doesn't matter to me, but... Are you motioning to table? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=942.956s">We'll</a>  do a motion to table.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=945.178s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Marks to table, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=948.201s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=948.561s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=949.242s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=951.044s">One</a>  in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=952.305s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=958.03s">Motion</a>  is tabled.</p>

    <p>[X_nYXZZ4ChY_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=959.512s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=960.032s">Undebatable.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=969.604s">While</a>  we're into suspension, this is a wonderful evening of celebration tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=975.886s">Two</a>  members of the city council will be retiring, leaving the council, and we wish them well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=982.029s">They</a>  each have many members of their families and friends and longtime supporters with them here tonight to help us in that celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=990.357s">But</a>  as is custom, we'll give, at this time, invite each of the Councilors the opportunity to make a final address on this occasion and to speak to their colleagues and to the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1006.386s">And</a>  then after such presentations, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1009.405s">uh,</a>  of, uh, speeches on behalf, uh, from both, uh, members will, uh, adjourn, uh, to enjoy some refreshments and presentations of, uh, gifts from the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1021.035s">So</a>  at this time we're going to do you want to do them afterwards or do you want to do them all together?</p>

    <p>[Ray Scarfo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1028.4s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1038.152s">15-809</a>  offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that Medford City Councilor Robert Penta be recognized for his four decades of public service and dedication to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1048.935s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1050.996s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and it's my honor and pleasure to speak on behalf of a colleague I've served with for the past 16 years, someone that I've grown to respect and admire, and someone I got to know outside of <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1067.759s">uh,</a>  this reeling and, um, consider, uh, not only a friend, uh, but a close friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1076.242s">And</a>  that is a councilor Bob Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1078.883s">Um,</a>  Bob is the longest serving city councilor in this city's history and also the longest serving consecutive city councilor with 18 terms or 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1089.986s">Mr.</a>  President, that alone is an accomplishment in this day and age, you know, far too often, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1096.228s">You</a>  hear about people serving public office and within a year or two, you know, something comes up or, you know, their name is besmirched and, you know, things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1108.459s">And</a>  here we have a gentleman that served with distinction for 36 years, the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1114.684s">And</a>  I really find it amazing that someone that's been so vocal in the community and willing to talk on every issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1123.707s">You</a>  know, there are times that we'd have tough votes that, you know, we'd discuss ahead of time and say, well, what do you think about this and what do you think about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1133.91s">And</a>  then we'd have a crowd of people come up, a crowd of residents, and there may be 150 residents in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1141.833s">And</a>  surely, Mr. President, you'd see one by one the councilors <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1147.926s">say,</a>  well, 150 people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1149.808s">I</a>  was going to go this way, but now I may go that way, you know, counting the number of votes out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1156.554s">And</a>  I can unequivocally state, Mr. President, that that never happened with Bob Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1178.606s">There</a>  were times when this audience was filled with people, and you can count on Bob standing up, speaking his mind, never swaying on the number of people here, the number of emails, because he was a man of conviction, a man that had principles, a man that felt that he was doing the best on behalf of the community, whether there was five people here or 500 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1202.818s">And</a>  that's a trait that you have to admire. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1205.579s">It's</a>  something that I admire because it's not an easy task. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1209.061s">You</a>  know, the easy thing to look out in the audience and say, there's 100 people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1212.002s">I'm</a>  with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1212.762s">Because</a>  as an elected official, you want to be everyone's friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1215.883s">But</a>  it's the harder thing, Mr. President, to stand up and stand by your convictions, no matter what the odds are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1221.946s">And</a>  that is Bob Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1223.506s">You</a>  know, when you look at the years, 36 years, you know, a lot has changed in 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1228.728s">Jimmy</a>  Carter was President when Bob Penta got elected in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1234.919s">A</a>  postage stamp was 15 cents when Bob Penta was elected in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1240.664s">And</a>  Billy Joel's song on the charts was, It's Still Rock and Roll to Me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1246.888s">In</a>  1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1247.949s">So</a>  as you can see, a lot has changed over the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1250.331s">And</a>  the one thing that has remained constant is Councilor Penta's commitment to this community and the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1257.157s">That</a>  has never wavered in 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1260.219s">You</a>  know, Bob fought for transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1263.111s">He</a>  fought for fiscal responsibility, a common sense approach to city government, and never, as I mentioned, never changed his vote no matter what the odds were or what the issue was. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1276.016s">Bob</a>  was always true to himself and always represented the people in that manner, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1282.158s">Bob</a>  served for many years on a lot of different boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1285.799s">We'd</a>  be here all night if we went through every one of Councilor Penta's accomplishments, but just to name a few, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1291.954s">Bob</a>  was a member of the Community Advisory Board for the New England Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1296.195s">Bob</a>  served on the Board of Directors for the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1299.376s">It</a>  still does currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1301.037s">Bob</a>  serves on the Board of the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1303.997s">He's</a>  one of the Board of Directors for the Brooks Estates Land Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1307.258s">He</a>  is a member of the Mass Municipal Association Board of Director and past member of the Public Employee Policy Environmental Committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1316.081s">Over</a>  the years, there's been a number of issues in the community, and I can tell you firsthand, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1321.846s">When</a>  the parking program came up, and there were a lot of people pro and con on the parking issue, it was one person that went to every one of the five business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1332.3s">One</a>  person that went into the business, no matter what size you were, no matter what your business was, and asked, how is this impact your business? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1340.224s">Is</a>  this going to be good or bad? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1341.945s">And</a>  that was Bob Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1343.586s">No</a>  one else went around to every business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1345.967s">And</a>  I'm going to speak for every one of the councils, because I didn't hear anyone else going around. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1349.669s">Bob</a>  Penta went to every business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1352.071s">He</a>  didn't have to do that after 34 years on the city council, being the senior member. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1356.733s">He</a>  did it because it was the right thing to do, and he wanted to be in touch with the small businesses in this <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1361.998s">community</a>  to see how this parking program would impact business. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1366.58s">And,</a>  you know, that took a lot of time and effort and things that don't go noticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1371.703s">That</a>  wasn't on the front page of the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1374.905s">That</a>  wasn't in every post that you read and on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1381.168s">But</a>  that was something Bob did to be in tune 36 years or 34 years after getting elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1388.391s">I</a>  think that speaks volumes for his character, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1394.256s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, Bob Pinto was one of the first to offer a line item in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1401.481s">Never</a>  happened before in this city's history for the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1404.523s">Bob</a>  realized the importance of having a strong art community in this city, and Bob witnessed firsthand what the arts can do with their own minimal money, let alone having money put aside in the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1419.074s">There</a>  are thousands of people that get impacted in our community from the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1423.803s">And</a>  that was Bob Penta's resolution to speak up for the arts in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1429.387s">And</a>  I know many of the artists will always be beholden to Bob because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1433.909s">Bob</a>  was the first elected official when we had the embattled Medford Housing Authority with their executive director come under a lot of controversy a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1443.735s">And</a>  many people didn't want to talk about it because, you know, it's just an issue we didn't want to touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1449.059s">Bob</a>  Penta was the first elected official <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1451.793s">to</a>  stand up and say, something's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1454.434s">Something's</a>  wrong with this housing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1456.615s">More</a>  is going to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1457.675s">And</a>  eventually more did come out, but that Bob had his ear to the grind constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1462.817s">He</a>  had his finger on the pulse of this city and he wasn't afraid to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1467.059s">Um,</a>  you know, Bob was the first, uh, elected official to stand up, uh, with the potential merger with partners and Lawrence Memorial hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1474.621s">He</a>  was the first to put it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1476.782s">He</a>  put it on the agenda 25 times, but he was the first to put it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1481.005s">And</a>  he kept it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1482.166s">He</a>  kept the issue going so people knew what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1485.369s">People</a>  that worked for the hospital knew what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1488.691s">So,</a>  you know, I give him a lot of kudos for being the first on these very important issues, not only to bring them up, but to make people in the community aware of what's going on in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1500.2s">The</a>  clean up and fix up week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1502.242s">It</a>  still hasn't happened, and I hope under the new administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1505.965s">This</a>  is an issue that Bob Penter has brought up for several years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1509.606s">And</a>  think about it, with the new trash program, you have to be very selective what you put out on the curb now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1514.647s">And</a>  Bob devised a program that you can put out once a year, whatever you want, and the trucks will come by and pick up your sofa, your bureau, whatever it is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1525.55s">And</a>  I just think that's an ingenious way of getting people maybe that want to clean out a cellar or an attic or <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1531.792s">have</a>  the kid coming back from college, and I want to make some room to allow residents to toss out more stuff on the sidewalk without calling. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1542.877s">Bob</a>  Penta called for charter review 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1546.399s">There</a>  was no discussion 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1548.16s">Now</a>  there's a lot of discussion about charter review because our charter hasn't been reviewed in 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1553.802s">And</a>  there's a lot of discussion now, and I think many elected officials are on board now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1557.904s">But</a>  it was 10 years ago that Bob was calling for charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1561.562s">and</a>  to take a look at the city charter, which is the master plan on how this city operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1566.745s">And</a>  that was Bob's vision 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1570.668s">Also,</a>  public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1572.649s">We've</a>  been without public access for several years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1575.851s">Bob</a>  Penter has been the champion to bring back public access in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1580.193s">Not</a>  for Bob Penter, not for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1582.535s">We're</a>  on Tuesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1584.136s">For</a>  the people in this community, local programming that we used to have in this community, which is very important, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1590.332s">to</a>  the success of this community and to the well-being of our sports programs and arts and culture in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1598.358s">Bob</a>  Penter has realized that for years and has been an advocate and a champion for public access in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1605.743s">The</a>  Courtyard Nursing Home, when neighbors got up in arms because they leveled all the mature trees in the back of the Courtyard Nursing Home, Bob Penter stood aside all the neighbors and said, what are you doing here? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1618.13s">And</a>  he forced the hand of the nursing home to plant mature trees to act as a buffer, like it was originally, between the neighborhood and the back of the courtyard nursing home. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1629.115s">And</a>  that was Bob Penta that stood up on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1634.789s">So,</a>  you know, I'm proud to say these comments about my friend, Bob Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1643.416s">He</a>  will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1645.258s">I</a>  know I'm not the only one that's going to miss him, but he will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1650.782s">And</a>  my wife will be happy because I'll be getting home an hour earlier now on Tuesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1657.387s">So</a>  I'll be home in a reasonable time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1660.35s">But</a>  honestly, I hope to see <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1664.848s">you</a>  around, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1666.429s">I</a>  hope to see you stay active. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1668.209s">You</a>  have such a knowledge that we as a community need to tap and stay involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1673.611s">And</a>  I've always envied your record keeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1676.892s">I</a>  mean, you would pull out resolutions from 1983. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1679.452s">I</a>  can't find the resolution from last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1685.234s">And</a>  you would have a catalog. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1687.175s">Susan,</a>  your house must be like the CIA. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1690.576s">You</a>  must have a file on each <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1693.406s">It's</a>  amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1694.087s">Over</a>  the years, the information that you're able to obtain and access through your cataloging and due diligence, I think, is just another part on how you treated the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1705.474s">This</a>  wasn't just a side job that Bob Penta did on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1708.996s">This</a>  was Bob Penta's full-time job, and he treated it like a full-time job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1717.696s">know</a>  there's a number of residents here that would like to present Councilor Penta, in addition to what we as a council are presenting, Mr. President, there are a number of residents that would like to present Councilor Penta with the gift for his 36 years of dedicated service as a public servant to the residents and to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1742.354s">So</a>  at this time, I would ask that the residents come up with the gift that they have, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1747.818s">and</a>  present it to Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1768.873s">Thank</a>  you, Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1771.495s">Councilor</a>  Marks and through the chair, there were a few people, several people, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1776.333s">I</a>  would like to say a few words before we make the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1779.534s">I</a>  figured it would be better, uh, to do that first, if that's okay and agreeable with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1785.017s">Uh,</a>  don't want to make this, you know, um, too long, but, uh, I'd like to give them the opportunity to speak first and then I'll come commence with the gifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1793.78s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1799.283s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1799.843s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[WGXTX-2t8pY_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1800.543s">Address</a>  for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1801.484s">I</a>  form a student president of the council for Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1805.223s">Mr.</a>  Griffin. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1805.884s">My</a>  name is Jay Griffin. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1807.245s">I</a>  live at 8 Arbor Glen Lane in Methuen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1810.427s">I</a>  want to congratulate Councilor Camuso, another former student, on his service to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1817.212s">But</a>  in particular, I want to address my remarks to the citizens of Medford and to one of my closest friends, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1826.66s">I</a>  just want to take a few minutes of your time to reflect on my thoughts about Boab. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1833.061s">Bob</a>  Penta speaks his mind, as Councilor Mark said. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1837.544s">He</a>  doesn't sugarcoat anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1840.265s">His</a>  speech doesn't pander to any group. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1843.907s">He</a>  says what he feels. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1846.949s">Councilor</a>  Penta has been an outspoken champion of preserving Medford's proud history. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1854.354s">Without</a>  his support, there would be no Brooks Estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1858.876s">Councilor</a>  Penta served with me on the executive board <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1862.507s">of</a>  the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1865.468s">Bob</a>  raised money and promoted the estate every chance that he had. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1872.052s">The</a>  carriage house would not be in such a terrible state of disrepair today if the city had supported the reuse plan that he had pushed before. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1884.397s">Bob</a>  Penta also served on the executive board of the Medford Historical Society with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1890.962s">He</a>  was always the first to volunteer when we had special events, exhibits, and tours. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1899.128s">Councilor</a>  Penta made sure that the city funded the restoration of the Historical Societies Museum on Governors Avenue and the preservation of the Craddock or Peter Tufts House at 350 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1914.607s">Many</a>  years ago, I came before the Medford City Council to address problems that were taking place in Royal House Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1922.65s">I</a>  actually brought a brick from the wall and slammed it down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1928.291s">We</a>  had kids in the park drinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1930.932s">I</a>  found hypodermic needles. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1933.393s">There</a>  was no lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1934.513s">The</a>  wall was too high. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1935.774s">Everybody</a>  could hide. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1938.108s">Bob</a>  worked with Bill Slagle, and between the Royal House Association and the City of Medford, we spent $40,000 to put the new wall around Royal House Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1952.875s">At</a>  present, there is no lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1956.356s">I</a>  just drove by just to be sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1958.877s">There</a>  were two lights there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1961.317s">He</a>  had three lights put in, two that illuminated the park and one that would shine on the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1968.802s">As</a>  you go home tonight, Fred, look, it is pitch black. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1972.945s">You're</a>  waiting for trouble to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1975.407s">The</a>  fence between the park and the house has been destroyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1979.95s">There's</a>  big holes in it because the beech tree came down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1983.412s">So</a>  now this is in this city council's hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1988.275s">I</a>  can see <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=1990.919s">In</a>  the future, if you don't put some kind of lighting in there, you're going to lose one of the premier national historic sites in the state of Massachusetts and in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2004.267s">It's</a>  classified as one of the top 20 in our state. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2008.809s">I</a>  cannot believe that we can't put in green LED lighting and illuminate that whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2017.134s">It's</a>  a plus for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2021.49s">The</a>  city of Medford has three historic homes open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2025.913s">The</a>  Craddock House, built in the 1600s. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2029.215s">The</a>  Royal House and Slave Quarters, built in the 1700s. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2031.777s">The</a>  Shepherd Brooks Manor, built in the 1800s. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2038.321s">Any</a>  other city would support the efforts to preserve and highlight 300 years of outstanding architecture. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2047.495s">These</a>  houses, if preserved, would draw tourists who would eat in Medford restaurants, shop in Medford stores, and this is something that Bob has championed his whole time on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2060.898s">He's</a>  always been a leader, not just giving speeches when the chamber's full like it is tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2068.42s">He</a>  has spent countless hours on many executive boards, at many meetings, trying to preserve Medford's long and rich heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2078.824s">At</a>  this time, I'd like to ask God to bless Bob and Susan as they begin the next chapter of their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2086.15s">And</a>  I dropped the gauntlet down to the current city council administration to correct these inequities. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2092.275s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2093.596s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2412.417s">Thank</a>  you, City Council, Council President Del Russo, for being allowed to speak here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2418.338s">My</a>  sentiments also to Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2422.599s">We</a>  had a few nice battles, but we always walked away smiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2428.8s">I</a>  have a few words I'd like to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2430.38s">I'm</a>  trying to do this in a different approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2433.401s">I</a>  have two quotes here I'd like to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2438.301s">First</a>  one, be more concerned with your character <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2442.147s">than</a>  your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2450.509s">That's</a>  from John Wooden, who was one of the most winningest coaches in college basketball, who won 10 championships in a 12-year reign with an unprecedented seven in a row, seven consecutive wins. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2464.052s">The</a>  second quote, I believe there's an inner power that makes winners or losers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2470.868s">And</a>  the winners are the ones who really listen to the truth of their hearts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2475.771s">That's</a>  from Sylvester Stallone, otherwise known as Yo Rocky, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2481.074s">Now,</a>  why these two? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2483.956s">One</a>  is a fictional character portrayed by an actor, and the other was an actual human portrayed by a human, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2491.62s">But</a>  what did they have? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2493.261s">They</a>  not only taught the talk, they walked the walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2496.825s">They</a>  did so with compassion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2499.386s">They</a>  did so with integrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2502.327s">And</a>  they were determined to have things go the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2506.448s">But</a>  it was always for the other person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2508.269s">It</a>  wasn't for themselves solely. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2510.509s">And</a>  that's what Bobby Penter is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2512.93s">I</a>  knew Bobby Penter back in the days of driving canteen trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2517.632s">He</a>  gave most of the food away to the needy kids in Roxbury and Dorchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2521.013s">A</a>  lot of people don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2522.81s">He</a>  was always being yelled at for not being able to pay his bill because he was giving the food away to the hungry people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2527.774s">But</a>  he's always been, no matter what, no matter what kind of adversity there was, he stood up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2533.918s">He</a>  stood up for what he believed in and what he felt the people wanted him to believe in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2537.781s">And</a>  with that, there's a lot of baggage that comes with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2541.845s">And</a>  a lot of people don't understand, but he has conviction, he has integrity, and he's been a really good friend to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2550.111s">And</a>  I hope he feels the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2552.327s">about</a>  me to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2553.929s">Now,</a>  that's all I have to say in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2556.912s">What</a>  I would like to do right now is I'd like to give Mrs. Penta, Susan, the backbone of Mr. Bobby Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2565.32s">I'd</a>  like to present her with something. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2566.601s">Where</a>  are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2567.342s">Come</a>  here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2615.584s">She</a>  earned those roses, let me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2622.605s">Now,</a>  we know you worked very hard during the campaign this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2628.587s">And</a>  your supporters and your friends felt that the two of you deserve something to show our appreciation for your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2637.989s">So</a>  the first thing I have is a gift certificate for a lovely meal for the two of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2646.541s">to</a>  a place called Il Posto in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2650.685s">So</a>  the two of you can go and enjoy a nice meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2655.368s">To</a>  start your new year off, a bottle of Dom Perignon. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2670.441s">And</a>  we hope that is just the beginning of a new life for you and Susan. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2675.47s">And</a>  for Councilor Penta, we have a special gift for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2680.713s">Would</a>  it be okay if Councilor Penta could come over to the podium, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2694.76s">What</a>  we have here is a 1904 edition of the City of Medford on parchment paper that's framed <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=2704.813s">The</a>  inscription says, Robert M.

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3114.535s">What</a>  can I say? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3114.895s">You</a>  also have a motion here, be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Robert M. Penter on being the longest serving City Council member in Medford history.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3125.96s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3127.06s">Um,</a>  I don't even know where to begin, you know, uh, 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3133.763s">I</a>  was two years older than Councilor Lungo, you know, and, uh, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3141.427s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3143.745s">For</a>  the first time, I'm speechless. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3145.026s">You</a>  know, Bob, you're really a fellow that's kept me young over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3149.908s">Sometimes</a>  you'd think that we were two kids getting ready to fight at Playstead Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3154.491s">But</a>  in reality, we were both just fighting for what we really believed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3159.454s">And</a>  that's something that I admire about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3163.816s">I'm</a>  going out this evening, retiring as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3166.698s">And</a>  the council's not going to be the same without you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3171.673s">I</a>  respect your loyalty, your tenacious ability to fight for what you believe in, and you've certainly been passionate over your tenure on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3182.719s">One</a>  thing that I really admired about you, and I was going through a similar situation at the time with my dad, was when you cared for your lovely wife, Linda, and I saw a side of you that most people didn't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3199.109s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm just talking about my dad, I get a little emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3203.81s">But</a>  you really are a good-hearted guy, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3206.151s">At</a>  the end of the day, and the good part about it was, I'd see you at Bocelli's or something, after a meeting, you'd still tell me how much I stink, but we could laugh about it, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3218.695s">But,</a>  like I said, I'm going out tonight, we're both going out as winners, we both won by fighting for the people of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3230.759s">didn't</a>  want to make it sound, I'm in good company of leaving this room tonight with another councillor that I know left his best battle on the field and you fought for what you believed in and for that you should be very proud.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3258.074s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very, very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3260.255s">But</a>  more importantly, Councilor Penta, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3262.256s">I</a>  think everybody behind the reels has been involved in government for a good portion of their professional career. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3269.778s">And</a>  we've all had interactions with Bob Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3272.439s">And</a>  one thing I can say about you, Councilor, is I'm certainly very disappointed that I don't have an opportunity to work alongside you for more of a tenure than I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3282.983s">I</a>  think everybody behind this reel has had an opportunity to work with you a little bit more than I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3287.211s">And</a>  one thing that I've really been able to take away from working with you, Councilor, is that it's about the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3294.266s">It's</a>  not about personalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3295.769s">It's</a>  not about <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3297.04s">Winning</a>  or losing it's about the issues and it's about doing what's right for the people in Medford and you and I could maybe not get along on one issue and When that issue is over and the votes taken two seconds later something else is on the table It needs to be addressed and what's over is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3310.853s">What's</a>  done is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3311.914s">Let's</a>  work on the next thing Councilor So I certainly appreciate the way that you can leave it behind the rail, but it's not about personalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3317.659s">It's</a>  about it's about people It's about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3319.781s">It's</a>  about moving Medford forward Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3322.548s">Another</a>  thing I'd like to congratulate you on is what a hell of a campaign you were in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3337.092s">What</a>  a hell of a campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3340.173s">You</a>  weren't outworked, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3341.354s">You</a>  weren't outworked. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3342.374s">You</a>  did a great job out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3343.494s">You</a>  pounded the pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3344.275s">You're</a>  out there working hard every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3346.085s">And</a>  I don't think that anybody can ask for anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3348.808s">So</a>  thank you very much for all your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3350.71s">Thank</a>  you very much for what you've done to make the city of Medford a great place, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3354.335s">And</a>  I know that this is a retirement party, but I'm pretty sure that you're not going to be gone for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3360.301s">So</a>  thank you very much, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3361.863s">It's</a>  been a pleasure working alongside you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3381.292s">And</a>  if I could, from the chair, thank you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3385.213s">I</a>  want to thank you for the encouragement you gave me when I first ran, and all the support you gave me in that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3392.915s">Though</a>  I was born once you started serving, you did serve for my father, and I learned a lot from that era. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3405.699s">It's</a>  been good to serve with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3408.399s">You've</a>  done very well for the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3411.197s">You've</a>  fought for a lot of people who didn't have a voice, and you made their voice heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3419.181s">You've</a>  come to the end of your term. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3421.782s">You</a>  have a wonderful opportunity to recreate your life, to enjoy it anew with Susan, to spend time in Florida, where all the retired politicians from Medford go, and sit around and look for things to do, drive their wives crazy, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3442.468s">and</a>  talk amongst themselves about how all of us left here don't know what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3450.492s">So</a>  we wish you well, and we hope you have a wonderful time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3455.035s">Thank</a>  you, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3464.266s">So</a>  that on the motion of Councilor Marks be approved, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3467.549s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3469.17s">And</a>  Councilor Camusos, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3473.053s">Councilor</a>  Camusos, 15-817 also be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3476.676s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3477.756s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3478.897s">While</a>  we're under suspension, be resolved, offered by Councilor Knight, that the Medford City Council congratulate Paul A.

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3492.162s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3494.265s">And</a>  my relationship with Councilor Camuso is a little bit different than mine with Councilor Penta, because I think that this Super Bowl Sunday, Paul, will be 30 years that we've known each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3506.577s">And</a>  our families have been friends for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3508.919s">His</a>  uncle Fred and my father taught together in Somerville for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3512.726s">Paul</a>  and I have been very familiar with one another through Medford Youth Sports, Medford High School, his inaugural campaign, and I could go on and on about Paul's accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3523.855s">We</a>  could go on and on about what a great guy Paul is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3527.937s">how</a>  dedicated he is to the community, to his family, to his brothers, to his mother, to his late father and his grandmother. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3535.683s">But</a>  I think that when you look at the election results over Paul's tenure and term, we'll see that he topped the ticket seven out of eight times, Mr. President, and I think that that speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3548.492s">The</a>  people of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3556.629s">The</a>  people of Medford knew that Paul Camuso was doing his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3559.352s">The</a>  people of Medford knew that Paul Camuso was working. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3561.374s">The</a>  people of Medford knew that Paul Camuso was an effective city council and an effective member of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3567.081s">I'm</a>  just at awe, Paul, to sit here and see you step down and retire and go on to greener pastures. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3575.4s">at</a>  this point in my young political career, because it wasn't too long ago that you were cheating off my papers in English class in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3582.004s">So</a>  I'd really just like to take a moment to thank you for your friendship, but more so thank you for your service, because when your political career ends, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3593.744s">You</a>  go back to being a normal citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3595.825s">And,</a>  well, as normal of a citizen as you can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3598.846s">And</a>  I look forward to the laughs that we've had and the laughs that we're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3604.268s">I</a>  look forward to spending time with you and with your beautiful family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3607.449s">And</a>  I just can't thank you enough for all that you've done for the community and for me personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3610.65s">So,</a>  thank you very much for all.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3622.54s">I've</a>  had the pleasure of knowing Paul Camuso many years, because my son is the same age and playing youth sports together and all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3631.905s">I</a>  knew his mother and father very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3633.405s">It</a>  wasn't too long ago that I was driving Paul Camuso to school every day with my son. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3638.548s">We</a>  carpooled every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3641.63s">And</a>  who knew 20 years ago that I'd be sitting beside him here behind the rail helping the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3648.938s">I</a>  just want to thank him for his years of service and to the citizens of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3654.661s">Your</a>  mother and father would be very proud to see the kind of person that you've grown up to be.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3670.789s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3671.689s">I</a>  too would like to congratulate Councilor Camuso on his retirement, although I don't believe he's retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3680.053s">That's</a>  good for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3681.413s">You</a>  know, when Paul first got elected, I remember during one of the debates, Paul had a catchy line, and the line went like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3689.998s">If</a>  you need your sidewalk done, if you need a tree trimmed, if you need the snow plowed in front of the house, you call Paul Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3697.462s">And</a>  you know what, it dawned on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3699.223s">When</a>  I used to get constituent calls, I used to say, you know what, call Paul Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3705.929s">And</a>  let me tell you, sure enough, people would send me an email, call me back, say, hey, thank you for getting that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3712.575s">I</a>  got my sidewalk done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3714.517s">So</a>  Paul, you were more than a help, let me tell you, that you can understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3719.181s">But</a>  as Councilor Camuso mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3722.621s">Paul</a>  championed a lot of things on this city council, a lot of issues that he felt near and dear. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3728.304s">He</a>  was always someone that did the homework and was present. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3733.486s">Paul,</a>  you know, you don't top the ticket, as Councilor Knight mentioned, without being out there, without talking to people, without having your finger on the pulse. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3741.809s">And</a>  Paul was a constituent guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3744.11s">And</a>  that's what got him elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3745.811s">He</a>  thought all politics was local, like Tip O'Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3749.373s">And</a>  it's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3750.394s">It</a>  is local. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3751.394s">And</a>  you have to be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3752.415s">You</a>  have to be in the forefront. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3753.996s">And</a>  you have to get back to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3755.457s">So</a>  the one thing that I can say about Councilor Camuso is that he returned the phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3761.46s">He</a>  went to your house when you had a broken sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3764.522s">And</a>  he was there when needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3768.364s">And</a>  I respect that in him. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3770.005s">And</a>  I look forward to seeing him active in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3773.755s">active</a>  with his family, his young son, and his lovely wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3777.458s">And</a>  I see your father-in-law here who never comes out, Frank Femino. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3782.343s">I</a>  haven't seen Frank in... Hey, Frank! <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3787.087s">You</a>  must have promised him dinner tonight, because I haven't seen Frank out in a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3791.211s">But</a>  no, with all candid, really, I wish you well in your retirement, and I hope to see you active in the community.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3805.103s">Thank</a>  you, President DeLaRusso. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3806.684s">I</a>  also want to congratulate you, Paul, and thank you for your many years of service to the citizens of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3813.407s">You've</a>  done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3814.468s">I</a>  think one thing I admire is the responsiveness you had to the constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3819.85s">I</a>  think they'd call and like 30 seconds later, you'd be calling people back and something we can't even keep up with sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3826.133s">So</a>  you've done great work. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3828.854s">Enjoy</a>  your retirement with your family and your son. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3831.495s">And</a>  I wish you the best.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3841.056s">I</a>  could tell you many stories about Paul Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3845.343s">I</a>  first met Paul when he drove up to my house many, many years ago before he decided to run for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3850.09s">And</a>  from that point on, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3852.113s">It</a>  became a relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3853.855s">He</a>  should really be working for the city in charge of constituent service. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3856.978s">Because</a>  I think he really likes going out there and taking care of people's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3860.842s">Because</a>  he's like myself, he's a lover of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3862.664s">I</a>  like government in a different way than he likes it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3865.006s">But</a>  the interesting part about Paul Camuso, he has made my life extremely interesting for the last 16 years in this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3872.077s">Because</a>  if it wasn't for him, a lot of these issues really would never be magnified to the point that they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3877.281s">Whether</a>  you were a supporter or a proponent for the mayor or not or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3881.264s">He</a>  made it very interesting because sometimes that's what you really need. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3884.006s">You</a>  need this discourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3885.066s">You</a>  need this difference of opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3886.628s">And</a>  when you have a difference of opinion, that's when you learn sometimes what the issue is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3890.532s">And</a>  when the issue is being presented sometimes, you just lose concept of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3894.173s">But</a>  Paul and I, I believe we've had many, many differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3897.694s">But</a>  as he has said, at the end of the night, he'll come over and shake your hand, or I'll go over and talk to him, shake his hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3902.335s">It's</a>  just an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3903.015s">And</a>  that's all that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3903.915s">And</a>  you move on from the subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3906.215s">And</a>  what's really interesting here, there's three people here that were, you people were that young when they first started? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3912.937s">I</a>  don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3914.947s">But</a>  I'm not that old, so that's the point, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3919.771s">So</a>  I want to wish you good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3921.373s">Like</a>  him, I don't think he's going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3923.014s">He'll</a>  be around, and he's just taking a pause in life, and that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3926.377s">And</a>  sometimes you need to do that to refine yourself and get yourself back in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3930.661s">So</a>  I congratulate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3931.742s">Enjoy</a>  your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3932.302s">Enjoy</a>  your wife and your family, because that's what it's really about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3934.945s">The</a>  first thing in life is your family, and that's what you take care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3938.308s">Good</a>  luck.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3947.64s">Paul,</a>  our relationship started off very rocky, and it got better over the years, very much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3956.024s">What</a>  everybody said behind this rail is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3958.546s">First</a>  of all, you're probably one of the few people that have topped the ticket as consistently and as often as you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3966.43s">That</a>  says a lot about your commitment to this community and the people who live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3971.653s">Constituent</a>  services, no one gets it done like you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3976.789s">So</a>  when someone calls and leaves a message on your phone and says, I need that pothole filled, you can call them up and say, look out your front window 10 minutes later and they'll see the steam rising on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3990.277s">You</a>  get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=3991.697s">Um,</a>  you understand, uh, the great complexities of how legislation locally and on the state level works.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4001.903s">You</a>  understand the complexities of, uh, the workings of,</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4006.61s">civic</a>  government, and the management of a city in a way that's above average of most people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4015.214s">And</a>  those are all to your credit, and those are all things that have served you well as a Councilor, but will serve you well in whichever way you choose to serve the public again in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4032.082s">It</a>  was difficult sitting next to you down there, because as Mr. Griffin will remember, when I was a student, I have a touch of the ADD. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4041.726s">And</a>  you have more of a touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4043.947s">And</a>  so the two of us would be ricocheting off the benches there while we should have been maybe paying attention to what was being debated on this floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4057.662s">You</a>  are a young man. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4059.543s">You</a>  have a long way to go as far as whatever it is you're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4063.806s">And</a>  I hope that you'll continue to serve your community in one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4069.949s">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4070.95s">Enjoy</a>  your free time on Tuesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4073.511s">And</a>  I wish you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4081.593s">I</a>  think what we're going to do is just allow both you and Councilor Penta to address, and so we'll have Councilor Penta come up first where he's the senior member by service.</p>

She gave me a guidepost that I used in this very past election. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4217.985s">It</a>  basically was, true leadership is found in the plan that one has to offer for respectful consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4224.909s">As</a>  we all know, I did not run for re-election to the Medford City Council this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4229.832s">I</a>  ran for the office of mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4232.0s">At</a>  the outset, I want to thank Anthony D'Antonio, because four years ago, he broke the ice, saying in this community, someone can run against the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4240.547s">No</a>  one is invincible, no one owns the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4243.369s">Unfortunately,</a>  he didn't make it, but he tried, and he got 36% of the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4247.273s">That's</a>  a huge number to get, coming out of the box for the very first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4251.836s">I</a>  decided to run for this job this past time, only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4256.79s">to</a>  present a plan, a plan that would give you a vision, a plan that would give you an opportunity, and a plan that would tell you how your taxes and how your buildings and how your educational system would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4267.859s">I</a>  have to thank my wife, Susan. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4271.402s">She</a>  was the campaign manager to my campaign, and you know, I don't know why, she never was involved in politics before. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4278.167s">I</a>  needed and wanted someone who could talk to me and relate to the, as the person on the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4283.681s">and</a>  you can't say this, and this is what you should be doing, and how do we make this connection work? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4288.963s">She</a>  stabilized me during this campaign, because everyone knows, at the drop of a dime, I could lose it, and I have, and I have, and I'll admit it, and I have, and I have probably at council meetings in the past through the years, and that's only because of my passion for the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4303.127s">That's</a>  not because of any hate for or against any one person or any one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4307.698s">You</a>  know, the one thing this community really has to figure out, and with all due respect to the incoming administration, this election was not a landslide victory. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4316.064s">So</a>  there's a lot of work to be done here to make this city go in the right direction and to bring people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4323.269s">And</a>  to bring people together, there has to be an understanding that folks need to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4327.933s">And</a>  how do you get involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4328.853s">You</a>  need to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4329.794s">You</a>  come to that podium on a Tuesday night or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4333.877s">I</a>  will assure you of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4336.297s">I</a>  may be sitting there now up until January 4th, but I'll be behind that rail after January 4th, because if I think there's something... Because if I believe that there is something of major importance to our community, no voice should be stifled, past, present, or the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4363.619s">Because</a>  that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4364.861s">I'm</a>  71 years old, and I'm proud of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4366.983s">But</a>  I'm not old. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4368.024s">I'm</a>  not going to sit in a rocking chair, and I'm not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4378.137s">Two</a>  particular points I want to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4380.179s">And</a>  I think it definitely needs to be cleared up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4382.795s">because</a>  it was misdirected during this past campaign for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4387.6s">I</a>  was never against new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4389.903s">What</a>  I was against was the opportunity for the people of Medford to have voted for new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4394.468s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4395.689s">Number</a>  two, you were taking away your community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4398.192s">So</a>  when we went to 14 schools down to four, that was a huge change in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4402.974s">And</a>  a lot of people did not have their input into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4406.256s">And</a>  as a result of that, and the reason why we built new schools at that point in time, some 15 years ago, was the schools were becoming run down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4414.12s">They</a>  were becoming misused or not used correctly, and they needed a lot of repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4419.282s">Well,</a>  here we are now, some 15 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4422.483s">Rick</a>  Caviale, on his first year on the term, that's four years ago, that would have made it 11 years ago, produced a paper that said the new schools are $1,102,000 in repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4433.826s">We're</a>  right back to where we were. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4435.487s">That's</a>  why we built the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4437.267s">There</a>  is the need to making sure that the new council, the new school committee stays on top of their buildings, because look right up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4443.929s">That's</a>  almost three years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4446.17s">Three</a>  years old, and the city has yet to fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4448.972s">And</a>  the superintendent of schools was sitting right over there when that ceiling fell, and it still hasn't been fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4454.736s">People,</a>  you've got to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4456.237s">You</a>  need to stay involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4458.559s">You</a>  know, I'm over this feeling right now of being sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4461.741s">I'm</a>  not sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4463.483s">I'm</a>  glad because I have created a new family for myself, a family of people not only who believe, but they need and they want the change to take place in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4472.669s">They</a>  don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4484.613s">You</a>  know, this past election presented an awful lot of opportunities for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4488.455s">Opportunities</a>  for people to write for or write against. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4490.736s">Whether</a>  you liked me or didn't like me, whether you liked my opponent, whether you liked my Councilors or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4495.039s">You</a>  have two brand new Councilors, you have two brand new school committee people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4497.56s">That</a>  in and of itself should open up big doors for the people in this community who want to see how and where their election process is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4505.925s">And</a>  do they vote for the right people? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4508.514s">The</a>  only way you're gonna find out if you vote for the right people, don't wait for two years and wait for the campaign literature to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4514.237s">Watch,</a>  as I will, each and every week and each and every month, what's taking place on the school committee, what's taking place at the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4520.961s">And</a>  if you don't like it, speak up, I'll call your council, I'll call your school committee person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4525.023s">You</a>  just can't be a lump in the log and say, I'm against it, I don't like it, you need to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4530.367s">And</a>  people did speak up in this last election. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4532.668s">Unfortunately,</a>  it was a beautiful day, only 38% of the people came out to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4536.772s">Hopefully,</a>  I think on both sides, everybody would have thought more people would have come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4539.955s">But</a>  they didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4540.975s">But</a>  the 38 percent, they spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4543.137s">It</a>  was close, and I think we'll all acknowledge the fact it was close. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4546.059s">So</a>  there's no mandate one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4547.64s">But</a>  there is one mandate, and that's this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4549.702s">I</a>  think the people of this community expect the elected politicians to do their job on behalf of the people of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4555.346s">And</a>  that's what I did for 36 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4557.448s">I</a>  did my job, and I'm proud of the fact that I did do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4573.173s">You</a>  know, there's always people during the campaign that you want to acknowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4577.296s">And</a>  there's so many. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4578.217s">I</a>  could look at this entire audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4580.138s">But</a>  to me, he's my unsung hero in each and every one of my campaigns. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4583.601s">Whenever</a>  I ask him to do anything, he just does it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4585.743s">And</a>  there's no questions asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4587.064s">And</a>  that's my brother, Anthony. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4588.165s">And</a>  I have to publicly acknowledge him, because that's what he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4599.293s">And</a>  I just caught her eye in the back of the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4601.681s">And</a>  I want to publicly acknowledge you, Nancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4603.922s">You</a>  came here on behalf of the Perica family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4606.903s">She</a>  and her family stood out at the polls for me on Election Day because they believed in me, and I thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4612.466s">Nancy</a>  Perica. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4623.551s">You</a>  know, we could go on and on with stories here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4626.152s">And</a>  the second thing, I told you about the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4628.473s">And</a>  the second thing are the kiosks here in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4631.423s">As</a>  you all know, I'm just dead set against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4633.164s">I</a>  don't think they're working right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4634.344s">I</a>  don't think they, I don't think that, you know, you know, there's, there's a resolution on the council agenda here tonight and it reflects upon the fact that during this past campaign, my opponent put out a questionnaire as it relates to senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4647.41s">Should</a>  they be allowed to park for nothing? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4649.191s">Not</a>  only do I support that, if we're going to tweak it, then let it be tweaked and give some benefit back to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4654.694s">And</a>  I would hope that this city council holds the president administration <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4658.462s">feet</a>  to the fire by telling the Republic parking people that seniors do not have to park here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4662.905s">It's</a>  bad enough that you get taxed for everything else, and 45 percent of this community is made up of seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4667.628s">Give</a>  them a break, folks, because you get the water, you get the meals tax, you get the hotel tax, and you get your real estate tax, and anything else you want to talk about just keeps going up in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4677.034s">And</a>  while everything keeps going up in this community, salaries have not gotten up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4681.176s">Everyone</a>  that works in this building works for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4683.718s">Your</a>  taxpaying dollars pay for everyone's job in this particular building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4687.693s">To</a>  get your biggest bank for the buck, let them work for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4690.455s">And</a>  that would be an easy way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4691.796s">Remember,</a>  this republic company is here for 10 years, and you've got no control over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4695.878s">But</a>  the one thing you have control over is the people who signed off on that contract, and they have a right to go there and negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4702.123s">And</a>  when my opposition turn around and put that out there, and that's one thing I would be supportive of, that senior citizens of this city park for nothing in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4710.168s">They</a>  don't deserve to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4718.652s">When</a>  I mention my wife Susan, you have to understand something. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4722.315s">As</a>  much as a novice she is, she's been an educator for 23 years as a retired school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4727.619s">So</a>  she knows what English, the language is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4730.441s">Sometimes</a>  when I talk too fast, I say the wrong words. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4733.204s">It</a>  just doesn't come out right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4735.205s">And</a>  she says, you can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4736.306s">You</a>  can't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4737.787s">But</a>  I am blessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4739.929s">You</a>  know, Paul sort of like hit it on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4742.571s">I've</a>  been blessed with two women in my life and two families in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4749.478s">I</a>  am a very lucky man. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4750.539s">I</a>  am very thankful. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4753.902s">I</a>  didn't lose an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4754.882s">You</a>  know what I won? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4756.223s">I</a>  won the people of the city of Medford who believed in Bob Penta because I believe in you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4761.468s">And</a>  with that being said, I want to conclude by saying the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4764.79s">My</a>  friend, Jimmy DeVito, you'll understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4767.673s">In</a>  1942, it was General Douglas MacArthur who had to leave the Philippine Islands because at the Battle of Bataan, they got beaten up pretty bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4777.721s">And</a>  he was supposed to be taking a submarine to leave the islands, because eventually he had to get to Australia. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4784.222s">But</a>  he decided not to take that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4785.823s">He</a>  decided to take a PT boat and go up in the middle of the night to beat the Japanese at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4791.184s">And</a>  unfortunately, they ran into inclement weather on the whole nine yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4795.005s">So</a>  as a result of that, he was one of the two days in the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4798.306s">He</a>  was in open water. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4800.364s">But</a>  he was very lucky, because there was no Japanese boat that saw him traversing that water, getting to where he had to go to, in Mindanao. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4811.328s">Two</a>  days later, when he finally landed there, he made a very famous speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4816.009s">And</a>  when he made that speech, it was in Melbourne, Australia. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4819.25s">And</a>  this is what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4820.891s">This</a>  is his declaratory lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4822.311s">He</a>  says, I came through, and I shall return. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4827.806s">I</a>  took those lines and he says, how can I make that work for me tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4832.49s">So</a>  this is what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4834.772s">With</a>  that said, and with a Penta on the city ballots for the past 38 years, stay tuned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4841.417s">And</a>  while there may be a Penta in a pause mode, there will be a Penta to be continued in our days ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4864.138s">I</a>  thank you, my family, my friends, and even those folks who don't like me or didn't vote for me, because you know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4870.082s">You</a>  expressed your opinion, and I'm okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4872.784s">And</a>  for all those who've supported me in my positions through the years, and may our loving and forgiving God bless all of us, and may God bless us all as he sees fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4881.95s">Bon</a>  attab. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4882.671s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4900.016s">I</a>  would be absolutely remiss if I didn't say this, because the highest thing on my scale of friendship is loyalty, and I forgot to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4909.163s">There's</a>  one person, and I will embarrass him, he's right over there, that guy right there, Michael Marks, from the day that I announced. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4924.954s">From</a>  the day that I announced, no questions asked, he stepped up, came forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4930.287s">over</a>  and beyond my friends, my new extended family of friends, but for an elected official to put his neck on the line, no questions asked, no wanting for anything, that to me is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4941.875s">These</a>  are my friends, you are my friends, and God bless you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=4944.717s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5019.624s">Councilor,</a>  you wanted to say?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5023.586s">You</a>  know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5025.826s">His</a>  tie. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5026.427s">Listen</a>  to his tie. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5027.907s">Huh?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5028.227s">Listen</a>  to your tie. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5029.008s">My</a>  tie. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5029.468s">There.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5032.509s">That's</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5034.93s">I</a>  would be absolutely remiss. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5037.211s">My</a>  daughter, Kim. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5038.611s">My</a>  son-in-law, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5041.152s">Aaron,</a>  my extended daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5047.575s">Aaron.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5064.357s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5065.257s">That</a>  was a very nice send-off, nice speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5070.679s">You</a>  know, I grew up in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5073.26s">As</a>  you all know, basically the only two mayors that I remember are Mayor Parikh and Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5081.623s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5083.584s">Still</a>  a little emotional, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5087.767s">During</a>  my last 16 years as a member of the city council, you know, I had some of the best times of my life, but also some of the toughest times of my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5098.355s">You</a>  know, a few people upstairs right now looking down that I know are proud of me are my dad, that many of you knew, Al, and my grandmother. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5110.263s">You</a>  know, I remember the, uh, the parties, the election night parties at my grandmother's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5116.467s">And,</a>  uh, we had some fun, you know, but, uh, you know, also in 2006, I married my best friend, Janine, you know, Janine, thank you for being there for me because as, um, as Susan knows, and the rest of the spouses of the, uh, Councilors, this is a full-time job, you know, and, uh, I, I, I had the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5140.32s">I</a>  had the, the word I'm looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5145.528s">I</a>  had the vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5147.269s">I</a>  saw that I was spending too much time actually doing this job and not enough time where it actually was important on occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5155.131s">And</a>  that's at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5156.832s">Because</a>  this job does take a toll upon you and more your loved ones than you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5162.914s">I'd</a>  be here fighting with my friend, and I'd be getting calls at my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5167.096s">You've</a>  got good supporters. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5168.056s">They'd</a>  call and yell at my poor wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5171.377s">But</a>  you know the stuff that goes along with this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5175.32s">And</a>  for that, I'm forever grateful, honey. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5178.301s">You've</a>  been there through some of my biggest struggles in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5182.464s">And</a>  you're the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5183.105s">I</a>  love you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5192.751s">Moving</a>  ahead a little bit, a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5195.913s">Next</a>  best, well, they're equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5198.918s">Best</a>  thing in my life is that little guy sitting in row number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5202.26s">Little</a>  Jimmy, stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5204.122s">Stand</a>  up, buddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5212.547s">As</a>  Bob said, this is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5214.169s">It's</a>  the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5214.929s">And</a>  I'm really looking forward to just getting grounded again and getting back into some sort of sense of normalcy of not being out on, it's not just Tuesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5226.687s">It's</a>  many a nights and you know the constituent service part, we have people in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5231.431s">I'm</a>  only as good as the people that have supported me and got me to where I needed to be at first. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5235.274s">And</a>  a few people that I want to acknowledge from my family is my brother John and my brother Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5249.998s">You</a>  know, I was very lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5251.218s">I</a>  got great in-laws and, and, uh, they do more babysitting for me to get out and to do the constituent stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5258.341s">Um,</a>  and, and, uh, you know, you're going to get a little more free time on your hands now too, Jeannie and Frank, cause I'll be home a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5264.864s">So,</a>  uh, so thank you for all that you've, uh, done for me and my family, um, over the years and also my brother-in-law Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5272.427s">But,</a>  um, you know, my original committee, they're mostly here tonight when I decided to run for office in 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5280.593s">I</a>  gathered the people that were just closest to me and near and dear. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5285.314s">And</a>  that's my aunt, my campaign manager, Carol Regan, who's right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5289.616s">Thank</a>  you, auntie. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5295.137s">Another</a>  person who's well known in this community from Medford Youth Hockey and just a real great person is Len Galeona, who's right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5308.747s">Also,</a>  someone that is on the DPW, I don't know if he's still here, but Mike Nesta, another original. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5315.644s">One</a>  of the original guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5319.023s">And</a>  also my pal, Jason, you know, right from the very beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5322.924s">My</a>  buddy, Jason Traviglione, he was there right from the beginning with several of my other cousins, Tommy, Terry, Tony, Johnny, Joey, and Artie. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5331.988s">You</a>  know, we hit the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5332.948s">And</a>  I'll tell you a funny story. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5334.349s">You</a>  talk about walking the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5336.209s">I'll</a>  never forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5337.09s">It</a>  was one of your neighbors on Summit Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5339.351s">We're</a>  passing out the first literature. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5341.511s">Guy</a>  calls me over. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5342.312s">I</a>  like the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5342.872s">It</a>  looks good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5343.652s">But</a>  you spelt commitment wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5345.553s">I</a>  go. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5346.436s">You've</a>  got to be kidding me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5347.557s">So</a>  instead of passing out literature, we're running back up the hill trying to take the literature back. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5352.7s">And</a>  of course, like any good politician, you tell a little fib. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5357.083s">I</a>  blame the printer, but it was really my fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5362.315s">A</a>  few City Hall department heads that have really been there for me over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5365.878s">That's</a>  Roy Belson from the schools, Mark Rumley, who's in the room in the back there, as well as the past president of the Medford City Council, Bob Mayorko. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5375.484s">You</a>  know, the people that were just very helpful over the years in giving me guidance, and I want to thank them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5383.77s">You</a>  know, 16 years is a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5386.552s">You</a>  know, I went back and just was plugging in the years on the computer, because I knew I had to speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5391.113s">It</a>  seems, uh, it was in 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5393.495s">That's</a>  when, uh, the big race between Al Gore and George Bush, when we didn't know who the president was. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5400.261s">That</a>  seems like many, many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5402.963s">A</a>  few years later or the next year we had September 11th, you know, and, um, there was also the good things. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5410.969s">As</a>  I was an elected official, I was able to stand here and get my picture taken with the world series trophy, a Patriots trophy, and also a Bruins trophy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5419.336s">You</a>  know, that's, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5421.485s">That</a>  just tells you how long 16 years is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5423.807s">And</a>  16 years is a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5425.289s">I</a>  couldn't do it, 38. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5426.99s">No,</a>  sirree. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5430.413s">You</a>  know, as far as the councillors, I mentioned Bob Mayorko. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5432.895s">Other</a>  two councillors that I served with when I first got on, it was Councilor Bill Carr, who Bill was just another good guy, and Councilor Macarena, who I served with for a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5443.024s">I</a>  just want to thank them, because I know how <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5447.37s">how</a>  this is sometimes on your family life and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5450.271s">So</a>  it doesn't go unnoticed, the sacrifice that all the councilors here have made over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5457.512s">Michael</a>  Marks, you know, when we first started out, Michael Marks and myself, we were close. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5463.813s">We</a>  were in that first little block of four who made Stephanie Muccini-Burke the president of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5470.315s">And</a>  we drifted apart over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5472.695s">But</a>  Michael, you're a stalwart. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5474.116s">You're</a>  a good kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5477.12s">You've</a>  got a good career ahead of you, and it's been a pleasure to serve with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5480.422s">And</a>  he said he's going to be on that side, so you ain't getting home early. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5487.826s">Ricky,</a>  what else can I say? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5489.047s">As</a>  you said, you used to drive us to Austin Prep with Ricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5492.709s">We'd</a>  be driving up to Austin Prep in the morning, and like screwballs, we'd put our hand out the window when it was 30 degrees so we could keep the hand outside the window longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5500.294s">Just</a>  stupid, stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5503.536s">But</a>  you'd be yelling at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5506.009s">I'm</a>  freezing in here, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5508.65s">But</a>  you're just a great, great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5510.572s">And</a>  your wife, Carol, who certainly is also a big champion behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5517.487s">Fred</a>  Dello Russo, when I first ran, I didn't know if I was running for the Medford City Council or running against Fred Dello Russo, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5523.952s">Everybody</a>  in this city made it a Camuso-Dello Russo race when Freddy first ran for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5529.096s">I'm</a>  sure some of you remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5531.198s">And</a>  so as Fred stated, it was a rocky start, but you know something, Fred? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5537.022s">Me</a>  and you became best pals here, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5541.244s">This</a>  guy right here, he's there for people in their time of need, but he's also been there for me, uh, as a fellow city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5547.988s">And,</a>  uh, and on occasion when I get ramped up, he'd tell me, Hey, calm down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5553.851s">And</a>  I'd listen to him sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5555.442s">Other</a>  times there was no stopping the kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5558.243s">But</a>  Fred, you know, I really value our friendship. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5561.524s">And</a>  I know we're going to be lifelong friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5563.565s">And</a>  your dad also was there for me when I first ran for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5567.347s">And</a>  just you come from an outstanding family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5569.487s">And</a>  thank you for being my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5574.93s">Adam,</a>  thank God for that English test. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5579.834s">You</a>  know, Adam, uh, Adam and I have been friends for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5583.475s">You</a>  know, Adam was there for me early on in my campaigns. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5586.377s">And,</a>  uh, I just wish I had more time to serve with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5589.118s">But,</a>  um, as I stated a little earlier, I just, uh, I'm looking forward to a little time off and, um, and having a nine to five, uh, day rather than, um, I will stay up, watch about half the city council meetings, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5602.143s">But,</a>  uh, but, uh, Adam, you're, you're just a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5606.196s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn, you know, went to Medford High School with Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5612.58s">And</a>  just, you're just a good kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5615.863s">You</a>  also fight, I call them kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5617.544s">I'm</a>  only a year older than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5619.845s">You're</a>  just a great person, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5621.506s">And</a>  I've watched you over the years become a good councilor, but also a mom of three children. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5629.8s">I</a>  find it tough with one child being a councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5632.843s">You</a>  know, you really are just, you're a stalwart, and you get out, and you really work hard, and I want to thank you for your friendship over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5642.971s">Councilor</a>  Bob, I've already said it, you're a good guy, and I'm going to miss our fights, because to be honest with you, I'm going to be honest with you, and if he wasn't there and I wasn't there, the meetings would be boring. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5657.043s">Fair</a>  to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5665.275s">You</a>  know, a few other people that I'd just like to. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5669.23s">to</a>  congratulate and thank is right over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5672.351s">These</a>  two young fellas over here, George Scarpelli and John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5676.933s">I</a>  know that Bob and I leave this evening, and we're leaving it in good hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5681.495s">These</a>  are two guys that are coming from the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5683.636s">They</a>  understand the complexity of issues, and it's not always a quick, easy fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5687.958s">As</a>  Councilor Dello Russo stated a little earlier, the legislative process sometimes moves a little bit slower than people would like, but at the end of the day, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5699.25s">This</a>  city's in good hands with the people coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5703.631s">Being</a>  that person that just drives the DPW crazy over the years, I saved the best for last. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5710.373s">The</a>  DPW, people don't realize the work that they do on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5715.874s">They're</a>  not only dealing with the stuff when they get in in the morning that they have the long list of stuff, but they're dealing with seven city councillors calling them, they're dealing with residents calling them, they're dealing with the mayor's office calling them, they're dealing with just <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5726.818s">They</a>  stop to get a cup of coffee and people are yelling and screaming, and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5731.044s">You</a>  know, people don't realize that the snow plowing, they think that after the DPW plows the snow away from their driveway, that they just come by to get a chuckle and put it back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5740.757s">It's</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5741.198s">It's</a>  to keep the streets clear for emergency vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5743.881s">It's</a>  a job that you do very, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5747.943s">And</a>  Steve Tanagli is in the back of the room, and he works as well with Mike Nestor and Paul Gere, who's our current commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5755.206s">And</a>  thank you guys for meeting my individual needs, because I have always taken this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5761.769s">You</a>  know, the big issues are going to be debated here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5764.21s">It's</a>  the one by one is how you build friendships, relationships, and how you build bonds that you'll have forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5773.274s">Councilor</a>  mocks Carol Bailey who was one of my closest friends over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5777.696s">I</a>  met her her son is in college now He's ready to graduate and I met her when Michael mocks called me because she had one of those funky streets in West Medford Hercroft Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5786.239s">It</a>  was the year Michael left the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5789.512s">Half</a>  of the street went to the Gleason School. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5791.613s">If</a>  you live right next door, you went to the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5795.116s">And</a>  through Councilor Marks, I was able to build a bond by helping out Carol and her son remain at the Gleason School or get into the Gleason School. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5803.001s">And</a>  one by one, that's how you build a good group, a good following behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5809.546s">And</a>  I just can't say enough about the DPW because they're great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5815.79s">If</a>  we can get a hand for those guys because they really are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5826.344s">The</a>  last two people I just want to acknowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5831.846s">I've</a>  got the wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5834.647s">You'll</a>  laugh, I've got to make sure, because I'll never hear the end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5839.629s">The</a>  last two people I'd like to acknowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5841.69s">There's</a>  one other person that's retiring at the end of this year with Councilor Bob and myself, and that's Mayor Mike McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5849.213s">People</a>  seem to think that I've just got this rosy, great relationship with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5853.615s">People</a>  don't realize how much we battle behind the closed doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5856.617s">And,</a>  you know, and even Councilor Pente, I think you'd say the same about Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5862.375s">You</a>  know, you can battle and battle, but he always tried to do what's right for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5867.376s">He's</a>  been a great mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5868.776s">You</a>  know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5869.297s">If</a>  he wasn't doing something right, he wouldn't be the mayor overwhelmingly for 28 consecutive years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5874.638s">So</a>  when you keep that into perspective, the man is retiring, the man's going to spend more time with his family, but I personally want to thank him for his years of service and the invaluable things he taught me over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5889.061s">So</a>  Mike McGlynn, good luck in your retirement as well if you're out there watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5892.662s">You</a>  know, it's sort of like some of those old TV shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5895.104s">No</a>  one watches, but everyone knows what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5897.126s">He</a>  still says he never watches it, but I think he's full of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5899.828s">I</a>  think he watches the council meetings, and he just says that, oh, I heard of this or that, but I think he's watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5905.633s">And</a>  if you are watching, Mr. Mayor, you've done a hell of a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5908.315s">It's</a>  been a good ride, and best of luck to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5918.041s">The</a>  next individual and in the last individual that I just want to recognize this evening, you know There was a race for mayor in this community the first time in 28 years and that's a long time 28 years it was former mayor Parika And then it was mayor Mike McGlynn for 28 years and in the new mayor-elect, you know as I stated <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5942.584s">Mayor-elect</a>  Burke has been a former member of this Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5947.185s">And</a>  you know, I hope that I'm saying this, but you know, people say, well, when she went to the mayor's office, she didn't do this or wasn't responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5958.287s">And</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5959.187s">People</a>  got to understand, she worked for another individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5962.468s">She</a>  worked for another individual that called all the shots in that office, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5966.965s">So</a>  I really think that this city is in good hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5970.248s">As</a>  Councilor Penta said, there wasn't a mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5972.71s">It</a>  was a very close election, but the people have spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5975.553s">And</a>  I think this is the time that we all have to get behind the new administration and work to make Medford a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5981.258s">Because</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5982.078s">She's</a>  in a position now where she can make things happen and not being the director of budget and personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5987.883s">And,</a>  um, and for that, and last but not least, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5991.222s">During</a>  this campaign, I was able to spend a lot of time with her and her family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5995.526s">And</a>  I just got to see a side of them that I necessarily didn't over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=5999.869s">And</a>  other than my dad, my dad always loved her as a Councilor because she was sharp and she didn't speak all the time on every issue, but she knew the vote she was taking and was very smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6011.579s">So</a>  I relied upon my dad's <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6018.158s">thoughts</a>  over the years, and Stephanie Burke, you're gonna be a hell of a mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6023.604s">I</a>  know you got big shoes to fill, but you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6026.487s">You</a>  surround yourself with good people, be open-minded, and just always doing the right thing, and this community's going to prosper. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6034.735s">And</a>  for anyone out there that may think differently, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6038.078s">Give</a>  her a shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6038.959s">There's</a>  always two years from now, you can take a look or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6041.983s">But</a>  I have the utmost faith in knowing her brains, her intelligence, and her compassion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6048.05s">Because</a>  in this job as mayor, you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6051.204s">And</a>  this is very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6052.245s">I</a>  admire the both candidates for mayor, because early on in the race, there were some things that made me ponder and say, I'm glad I didn't run for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6060.093s">And</a>  that was when you had to make major personnel decisions based upon actions of people that may have did something within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6067.34s">The</a>  mayor's office is a job that you're actually the CEO of a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6072.843s">You're</a>  saying people may not have a job tomorrow based upon some of their actions or based upon circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6080.888s">And</a>  so you need to be, you need to have a lot of different characteristics for that job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6087.112s">But</a>  Stephanie, I look forward to, and the mayor-elect is here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6091.836s">If</a>  you could please just take a bow. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6103.789s">But</a>  I just want to thank everyone for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6109.392s">And</a>  I know she texted me 30 times before, because I had to go get flowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6113.634s">But</a>  I'd like my son and my wife to come up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6116.135s">And</a>  I got little flowers for you, Whole Foods, but Dorico McGlynn was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6165.471s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6166.412s">Hey,</a>  go ahead, ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6167.893s">What</a>  did you just ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6168.594s">I</a>  want you to know what I got him.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6171.095s">What's</a>  in mine? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6171.956s">Two</a>  more days.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6174.038s">Yeah,</a>  two more days. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6174.838s">Santa's</a>  coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6175.899s">But</a>  on an all serious note, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6178.621s">This</a>  has been a hell of a ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6180.262s">And</a>  I just want to thank everyone for coming here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6184.413s">for</a>  me just because this is what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6187.256s">You</a>  know, you look around this room and there's 150 years worth of family and everything else, right James? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6194.523s">So</a>  God bless everyone and Merry Christmas and good luck to the new city council, the new school committee and the new mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6201.51s">Let's</a>  move this city in the right direction and I'll be on the sidelines watching.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6229.126s">on</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6231.568s">One</a>  more thing too.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6233.93s">One</a>  last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6236.112s">After</a>  I got here and I put the people that helped me get here, it's the citizens of Medford, it's the citizens of Medford that I owe a big thank you to because without them, none of this would have been possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6247.361s">So</a>  thank you Medford and good night.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6254.692s">Meeting</a>  is now in recess so we can do our presentations and enjoy two delicious cakes from Arthur's Pastry in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=6264.498s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7802.868s">Meeting</a>  will come back to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7817.772s">Meeting</a>  will return to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7819.912s">Silence</a>  in the gallery. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7821.033s">15-818</a>  offered by Councilor Camuso be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Michael J. McGlynn on his retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7831.036s">On</a>  the motion of approval by Councilor Musil, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7833.097s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7833.917s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7834.577s">15-810</a>  offered by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7837.398s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Metro City Council go on record as supporting a city's senior citizen exemption from having to pay to park in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7844.3s">Councilor</a>  Penta, where are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7846.221s">There</a>  you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7846.661s">Kind</a>  of addressed that too, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7848.522s">You</a>  on?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7849.222s">As</a>  I said earlier this evening in some of my remarks, one of the things that <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7853.714s">seems</a>  to have been a concern during this past campaign was the parking in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7859.078s">But</a>  the incoming administration over and beyond the August questionnaire that was sent out and then the commitment that was made during this past campaign and one of the debates indicated that the administration would move for a senior citizen discount with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7875.267s">So</a>  I would request that the council go on record to show the support for that as it relates to <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7880.814s">that</a>  for which had come up as a campaign issue and a commitment made by the incoming administration.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7886.676s">On</a>  the motion approved by Councilor Penta, Councilor Vice-President Mago-Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7891.497s">All</a>  set? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7892.097s">Yes,</a>  I concur. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7893.337s">As</a>  seconded by Vice-President Mago-Kern, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7896.418s">Roll</a>  call vote, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7897.778s">Roll</a>  call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7900.659s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, Councilor Knight, if you would.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7904.273s">Earlier</a>  this evening, we tabled a paper, a money paper, relative to the use of kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7908.734s">And</a>  we're going to investigate that a little bit further in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7912.175s">Audit</a>  and Budget Finance Subcommittee is going to take a look at whether or not the appropriation from the sale of real estate in the amount of $250,000 be transferred to be used for approvals to the five business districts, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7925.361s">You</a>  know, I certainly support an exemption for senior citizens having to pay and park in our city, but I think maybe we can take a look at this in a universal approach as opposed to as one item here, one item there, one item here, one item there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7936.812s">However,</a>  I defer to the body.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7938.694s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7940.278s">Mr.</a>  President, I would stick to the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7943.24s">It's</a>  a separate itemized issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7944.64s">It</a>  has makes no difference as it relates to what is going to be going forward with Louise Miller or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7949.643s">It's</a>  a, it's an item that was used as a campaign issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7952.504s">It</a>  was an item that was voted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7954.025s">It</a>  was an item that was campaigned on and it was an item committed upon by the incoming administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7959.727s">So</a>  being isolated as it is and following forward with that, Mr. President, I think it would be a good way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7965.87s">and</a>  some good strength to have the incoming administration realize that the City Council supports that resolution.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7971.654s">Motion</a>  of approval is on before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7974.536s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7976.098s">Councilor</a>  Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7977.158s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7977.759s">Councilor</a>  Cavill? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7978.399s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7979.18s">Councilor</a>  Monk? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7979.9s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7980.681s">Vice-President</a>  Humlker? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7981.682s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7982.282s">Councilor</a>  Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7983.003s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7983.683s">Councilor</a>  Packer? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7984.263s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7985.124s">President</a>  de la Ruche?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7986.165s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7986.585s">The</a>  vote is six in the affirmative, one in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7989.367s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=7992.039s">15-811</a>  offered by Councilor Penta be it resolved that many businesses and individuals who continuously and generously support and donate to all charities and people in need within our city be publicly acknowledged with a big thank you for their unselfish contributions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8007.598s">They</a>  truly helped to make without any public recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8011.305s">the</a>  Christmas season and at all times of the year, a better day for those in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8016.692s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8018.214s">Mr.</a>  President, unfortunately at this time of the year, individuals, some individuals get recognized for whatever their contributions might be, but there is a whole host of community folks, businesses, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8028.673s">and</a>  individuals who contribute all during the year for the purposes of helping those who are in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8034.378s">For</a>  example, you have one of the banks in the square, without mentioning them, has an annual thing for Toys for Tots. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8041.484s">You</a>  have the Medford Fire Department, who has an ongoing Christmas season situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8046.408s">But</a>  you have individual people who are philanthropic unto their own right, and they don't want any recognition at all, they just do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8052.453s">So,</a>  it doesn't make any difference whether you're a private business, a union, an individual, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8057.816s">These</a>  people, to some degree, if they're watching, should know that their contributions are recognized and appreciated, and as a result of that, it's our little way of saying thank you to them for being supportive for people in need when not asked to do so.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8072.68s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8074.122s">On</a>  the motion approved by Councilor Penter, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8076.905s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8077.546s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8079.348s">15-812</a>  offered by Councilor Penter, be it resolved that the recent Comcast cable bill be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8084.915s">Did</a>  we just discuss this?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8086.978s">No,</a>  it happened to come up in conversation, but the fact of the matter is in this recent monthly December bill, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8092.575s">from</a>  Comcast, it'll show that it's going from $3.25 to $5. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8095.696s">Now</a>  that's an increase of $1.75 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8098.996s">The</a>  city is presently sitting on over $450,000 of PEG access money, cable access monies, and as a result of that, still having no public access television here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8110.178s">And</a>  the city's use of those monies to pay for salaries up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8113.939s">I</a>  think it's incumbent upon the incoming city council to make a demand <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8118.097s">from</a>  the incoming administration, whether, in fact, they are going to have cable, public access, TV3, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8124.659s">And</a>  there might be a twist to that, because I think if we have all been watching what's on the news lately, there's a movement afoot between Channel 7 to possibly take over, that for which Comcast has right now, which is Nessun, and I forget the other one, and WHCH. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8144.181s">And</a>  with that being said, there is a possibility, if in fact this merger were to go through, and I think it would be the second highest, a multi-billion dollar merger, what could possibly happen as a movement, because if NBC does buy out the franchise, Anson, that they're looking to buy out, they could possibly retrieve the cable location of TV3 that we presently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8169.872s">and</a>  put it in a different spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8171.253s">That's</a>  okay, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8172.633s">But</a>  in the contract, on page five, it says the following, PEG's access channels, any licensee-owned channels made available by the licensee in the situation as Comcast and provided for use for the presentations of PEG access programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8186.52s">So</a>  if, in fact, if you read the contract and if you follow what's going on in the news, that if, in fact, this were to take place, there's a possibility of one or two things that ANSEN, WHCH, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8198.803s">could</a>  probably be bought out by NBC, and so wouldn't be Channel 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8205.688s">It's</a>  a side issue as it relates to the main subject matter, which is public access television, but I really think you two guys coming on as new councilors, you really have to understand that if we're going to allow public access here in the city of Medford, it needs to be worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8218.416s">And</a>  now, having a $1.75 increase per month on a cable access bill that people would be paying each and every month, that's approximately $60 a year, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8227.517s">That's</a>  a lot of money to people, you know, you take that it's another $60 and the Community Preservation Act It's another minimum of $165 as a rate increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8236.626s">It's</a>  another 7% that's going to be taking place on your water and sewer tax bills coming out So it is going to have an effect and I I would suggest mr. President this Medford City Council go into some kind of remedial <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8250.725s">a</a>  discussion as it relates to, you know, what's going on, not only with the rate increase, but, you know, how and why the city can collect this money, charge up to $5, and still not allow cable access television to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8263.014s">You</a>  may want to bring the city solicitor on board on this one here to find out if, in fact, with the great increase, can they still allow, can they still continue to allow not having public access, whether it be on Channel 3 or any other channel.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8275.669s">Thank</a>  you on the motion for approval, but I can put down a roll call vote so that we're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8279.252s">It's</a>  forwarded to the city solicitor, let him review it for the new city council and be further amended that the matter be sent to the city solicitor regarding the increase in the rate of, uh, uh, uh, yeah, they can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8296.604s">The</a>  line item in the cable bills allocated towards, uh, uh, community access. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8304.298s">there</a>  was a rate increase and what recourse the city has to end that and or what obligation we have to provide the service that people are paying for.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8314.97s">There's</a>  a value also there, too, Mr. President, of I think it's $454 or $455 million is if WHTH goes off the year, which is sort of like a sweet pot of the deal to make this thing more attractive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8326.356s">But</a>  I think the city needs to get itself involved, especially because of public access.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8330.318s">I</a>  wouldn't dare to recommend, but if you'd indulge me to suggest that this also be further amended to make this a priority of attention for the next administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8344.087s">So</a>  that's a amendment by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8347.248s">Roll</a>  call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk, at your discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8351.329s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8353.47s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8354.61s">And,</a>  uh, it's a resolution that I offered back, I think two or three times now before the council back over the last, uh, 10 years is that, uh, there was a special home rule petition filed by this council that allowed, uh, us, uh, the city to take 5% <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8373.648s">of</a>  the cable money go up to five percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8376.77s">And</a>  that was a special vote of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8381.294s">And</a>  I've offered resolutions in the past for us to do away with that home rule petition because clearly we're not getting any response from the administration regarding this peg money and the lack of having public access in the community while we still accept funds from the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8398.747s">And</a>  you know in my opinion if the administration who's the <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8402.399s">uh,</a>  authority on signing the contract is unwilling, uh, to discuss this issue that maybe we as the legislative body should, uh, file legislation to do away with the act. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8413.548s">Uh,</a>  I have the act of my desk somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8415.549s">Uh,</a>  I believe it was the act of 1980 or 83, uh, that created, uh, this, uh, uh, special vote of the council to allow it to take up to 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8426.738s">It</a>  went to 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8427.679s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8431.005s">which</a>  is a lion's share of the money for cable access, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8435.068s">So,</a>  I'm not adverse to going that angle if we're unable. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8440.872s">Maybe</a>  with the new administration, there'll be more cooperation.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8443.193s">So,</a>  we've got to be resolved one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8446.095s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8446.295s">Because</a>  it's unjust what we're doing to the people.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8448.096s">Well,</a>  it's two years worth of unjust, and I'm not sure how much longer we want to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8453.219s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8454.18s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8456.482s">Mr.</a>  Citizen, please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8459.103s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8460.306s">I'm</a>  Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8465.199s">Just</a>  really brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8468.968s">We</a>  need the community access station for so many different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8472.371s">It</a>  could help, you know, advertisements for the, for the five business districts for the arts and stuff going on, uh, Medford sports, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8481.838s">Uh,</a>  also politically speaking, we got a huge election year next year with state Senate and, uh, state house rep races. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8489.764s">Uh,</a>  the presidential primary is on March 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8492.946s">You</a>  got a number of state committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8494.707s">keep</a>  members up for election running from here from Medford, Medford candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8499.732s">I</a>  just want to make that statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8501.114s">I</a>  mean, all the other things, too, that community access provides on, you know, how-to shows and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8507.92s">We</a>  really need to have it in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8509.962s">But</a>  my question to this body, Mr. President, through the chair is, as Councilor Penta mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8516.652s">$450,000,</a>  that's almost a half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8518.894s">What</a>  happens to this money? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8520.776s">Do</a>  you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8521.376s">Is</a>  it put in a bank account? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8522.797s">Is</a>  it getting interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8524.839s">Is</a>  some of it paid out for some things? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8528.441s">I'm</a>  just unsure as to what happens to almost a half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8533.225s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8534.326s">Thank</a>  you, sir.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8537.789s">It</a>  was a rhetorical question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8539.25s">On</a>  the motion of approval by Council Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8540.971s">It</a>  was a real question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8541.932s">It</a>  wasn't rhetorical.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8546.334s">The</a>  first answer is that the $450,000 that's sitting there is that's for the PEG access money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8551.498s">So</a>  if, in fact, we had a public access studio, that money would go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8555.601s">That</a>  only represents 2 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8557.983s">That's</a>  3 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8559.224s">The</a>  other 2 percent goes into the general fund, and that money is being paid for employees up at the high school, which is a real question mark because there are some questions as to whether that's even legal or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8569.751s">So</a>  1 percent goes to the fire, 1 percent to the police, and 1 percent goes to public access. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8573.914s">That's</a>  the PEG money.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8575.065s">Thank</a>  you, counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8576.267s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8577.39s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8578.853s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8579.314s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record, sir.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8620.634s">I'll</a>  take that as a request to withdraw the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8625.877s">Petition</a>  15-814 at request of petitioner at the rail is withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8633.822s">On</a>  the motion of approval by Councilor Penta, roll call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8638.084s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you would please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8681.779s">Mr.</a>  President, most recently in a newspaper story published by the local press on December 17th, superintendent Belson was quoted as saying that the district has saved money in multiple areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8691.501s">So</a>  far this year, he said, it is also possible that the position will be filled by an employee who already works for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8699.35s">The</a>  position he's making reference to is the new public relations potential position that the school department is now being considering. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8706.336s">But</a>  I'm more concerned about his first line basically saying the district has saved money in multiple areas so far this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8711.861s">I</a>  think it would be important for the school committee as well as the city council to get a review back as to just what are those multiple areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8720.889s">Also,</a>  I would just like to conclude by saying the following, whether it be this or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8725.688s">We</a>  have asked for numerous occasions, and the council in the past has voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8729.49s">It's</a>  never taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8730.951s">So</a>  maybe this new school administration will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8733.553s">But</a>  at a minimum, the city council and the school committee should meet at least twice a year for the purposes of reviewing their financial wherewithals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8739.577s">Because</a>  this is kind of like a little bit disturbing, that if, in fact, we have money in multiple areas, when you have teachers there that are begging in time for school supplies, we're looking for special ed teachers, we're looking for teacher assistants in some of the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8755.627s">And</a>  we're having all kinds of areas here, and whether you're for or against hiring a person at $85,000 a year to be a public relations person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8764.529s">I</a>  think the first thing that needs to be considered is the teacher in the classroom, the needs of the teacher in the classroom, and the students that they have to take care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8772.134s">So</a>  I think Mr. Belson owes it to the entire community of Medford, the PTOs, the PTAs, and everything else involved, that if you have multiple areas for which the school committee should be apprised of, and if they were doing their homework, they would know where these areas and how much money there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8786.742s">That</a>  would demand a report back to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8789.593s">So</a>  I would move, Mr. President, on a roll call vote to the superintendent report back into what areas that money's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8795.714s">And</a>  if it's not going to affect those areas that the money's coming out of, then what's the purpose of taking the money out? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8803.756s">Why</a>  aren't you using that money to fill the positions in that area?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8807.277s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8808.657s">Chair</a>  recognizes the Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8810.778s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8811.958s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8813.658s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8814.239s">I'd</a>  like to see where the savings was. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8816.873s">Also,</a>  if I could amend Councilor Penta just to ask some information with regards to the mayor's discretionary funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8824.458s">I</a>  think it's a fund, it's labeled mayor's discretionary funding of school projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8830.702s">I</a>  know $95,000 was taken out of that fund two weeks ago and just looking to see what the remaining balance is with regards to that discretionary fund and possibly what else has been taken out of that fund in the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8848.413s">So</a>  I just want to see what the remaining balance is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8851.595s">Because</a>  I know a number of things were voted on with regards to improvements in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8858.198s">But</a>  within the last couple of weeks, since the council did speak out with regards to the new PR job that was implemented, I've received numerous calls and emails with regards to just lack of ink and printers, the state of the books at the high school, no raises for kindergarten aides, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8879.114s">Teachers</a>  getting barely no money for school supplies, lack of art supplies, security, lack of security, custodial services, toilet paper at the high school, aids in the classroom, teachers not getting reimbursed for flood damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8894.917s">There's</a>  just emails and people just want to stop and talk about the new position do keep coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8902.399s">So</a>  I would like to know what this discretionary funds for, how much is remaining in it, and <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8909.959s">Any</a>  information we can get on it would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8913.001s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8914.582s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8916.403s">So</a>  on the President's motion of Councilor Camuso, Penta, as amended by Vice President Lagarde, Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8924.069s">Just</a>  one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8925.57s">We</a>  say there was a flood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8927.031s">If</a>  so, what teachers were not reimbursed and where was this flood? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8931.554s">In</a>  a flood at the Roberts and a flood at the McGlynn over the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8934.836s">In</a>  specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8935.276s">Do</a>  the teachers have not been reimbursed for their own personal money putting out there?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8939.219s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8940.878s">Well,</a>  we should want to look into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8943.319s">Can</a>  the council at least give us the names after so we can get the superintendent to look at this as soon as possible?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8948.542s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8950.083s">You</a>  don't want to say it on the floor, though, because obviously you don't want to throw the teachers out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8955.226s">How</a>  many teachers in total on this?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8957.327s">I</a>  know three that had damage.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8960.528s">And</a>  when was this flood recently?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8963.63s">One</a>  was six months ago, and one was a year, 14 months ago.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8969.392s">The</a>  better question, too, is, I think, how is the building flooding? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8973.394s">Pipes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8973.874s">I</a>  think the pipes are breaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8975.375s">Yeah,</a>  if we could get the teachers' names and find out where the reimbursement is and for what type of things they're looking to get reimbursed on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8982.999s">Because</a>  obviously, if they're coming out of pocket for this stuff as a result of a maintenance issue, that's a problem.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8992.803s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8994.244s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Camuso, <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8997.368s">Chair</a>  recognizes the citizen at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=8999.849s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9151.039s">A</a>  motion for approval by Councilor Penta as amended motion to set. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9155.542s">Did</a>  you want to speak ma'am? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9157.658s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9159.66s">Mr.</a>  Messenger, would you assist with the microphone?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9924.191s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9925.231s">And</a>  I do want to thank Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9927.917s">Mr.</a>  Kamara served with distinction for a number of years on a very tough commission in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9934.982s">And,</a>  you know, people don't know this, but when Dominick first came on the Water and Sewer Commission, the water system was in terrible disarray. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9945.888s">It</a>  was in budget deficit, millions of dollars in budget deficit for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9950.351s">The</a>  city underwent its largest remetering program when we changed all the water meters throughout the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9956.962s">which</a>  was a giant project that Dominic was the chairman of. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9961.705s">Also,</a>  the tiered system that took place recently and the second water meter outside was under his tutelage as chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9971.37s">And</a>  the abatements. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9973.911s">I</a>  can remember the days going back five, six, seven, eight years ago where there was a laundry list of people that were looking for abatements because their water and sewer bill wasn't accurate because of outdated and old meters and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9987.22s">And</a>  it was under the leadership of Mr. Kamara that the Water and Sewer Department really turned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=9994.023s">And</a>  now we're experiencing multimillion dollars in surpluses and very few abatements because of a system that's functioning properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10003.586s">And</a>  I want to thank him for his nine years of service, Mr. President, on a very difficult committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10010.709s">And</a>  I look forward to seeing him around the community.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10013.133s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10013.633s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by uh, councilor calf yellow, all those in Oh, councilor Camuso, did you want to speak?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10020.918s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10021.118s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10022.019s">This</a>  will probably be my last speech at the city council, but who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10027.843s">Who</a>  knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10028.203s">We</a>  get a few minutes left. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10030.585s">Certainly</a>  this is a good one to end on as a method. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10032.846s">City</a>  council, Dom Camara is just a gentleman and um, served the citizens of Medford as a school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10040.035s">with</a>  dignity over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10042.477s">And</a>  rather than retire, he took on another role post-retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10047.6s">So</a>  I want to wish him well and thank him for his years of service as a commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10052.323s">As</a>  Councilor Mark stated, it's a job that you go into the meeting and you get yelled at and this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10057.907s">It's</a>  a thankless job, but a lot of work went into it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10062.67s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10063.85s">So</a>  a motion to approve by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10065.772s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10067.153s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10068.153s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10070.19s">Finally,</a>  offered by Councilor Camuso, 15-820, be it resolved that the Medford City Council sends its sincere condolences to the family of Phyllis Makowski, who passed away recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10081.139s">Mrs.</a>  Makowski is the mother of Medford Police Department Detective Paul Makowski. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10089.265s">Please</a>  join me and stand for a moment of silence for Mrs. Makowski. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10108.013s">the</a>  tabled records of the meeting of December 8th, 2015, the Feast of the Magical Conception, will pass to Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10115.139s">Mr.</a>  Sprooks, did you have the opportunity to inspect those records?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10119.182s">I</a>  had ample opportunity to review the records and found it to be in order to move approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10123.586s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10124.266s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Marks to approve those records, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10130.711s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10131.792s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10132.593s">The</a>  records of the meeting of December 15th, 2015 will pass to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10138.213s">Councilor,</a>  how do you find those records?</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10164.022s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10164.402s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10165.843s">You</a>  must be psychic, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10168.725s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushman Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10172.248s">I'm</a>  sorry I'm late. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10173.929s">I</a>  had to go to awake my brother-in-law. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10177.692s">So</a>  I wanted to say goodbye to some of these Councilors and mayors <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10181.874s">And</a>  I apologize again, but I see Mr. Camuso's, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10188.516s">He's</a>  not here, but I jokingly used to call him Mayor Curley, and I think he's done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10197.159s">He's</a>  done quite well for himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10198.72s">And</a>  if I may say, I believe he's a definite overachiever. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10203.362s">I</a>  congratulate him and wish him well in his future endeavors, as I wish everyone well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10208.924s">It's</a>  a wonderful life. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10211.382s">Also,</a>  I'd be remiss not to mention a fond farewell to the outgoing mayor, Michael, for he did do a lot of good things for our city of Medford on the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10225.826s">And</a>  third, Councilor Penta of 30-something plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10232.548s">Six?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10233.908s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10238.669s">I</a>  never ever heard any politician <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10241.875s">seem</a>  to care for the people as you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10246.359s">And</a>  we thank you for your many amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10255.286s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10257.928s">And</a>  we thank you, Councilor Panther, for your many amendments that alleviated some of our tax increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10268.117s">And</a>  although I never received any yes votes in my quest to lower our real estate taxes, we always knew where you stood on all issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10281.968s">On</a>  many occasions here at the public forum, it's been stated that we Councilors have no power under this plan A government. <a href="https://youtu.be/hBLcCaD3s_8&t=10294.088s">With</a>  that being said, maybe it's high time for you, Mr. Robert M.
