18
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,827

21
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:54,893
[SPEAKER_03]: When we first heard about the tragedy, we were shocked and felt like it was our obligation, as Crystal's fellow Mustangs and softball members, to do something for her legacy.

22
00:01:55,233 --> 00:02:00,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So we decided to dedicate our softball season to carry on her spirit, not only in our hearts, but also in our community.

23
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,040
Mustangs on three.

27
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:36,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Crystal Campbell's legacy will live on through the annual softball tournament, the Medford Strong t-shirts, and the scholarship fund throughout Medford.

28
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:00,244
do

29
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:33,111
you

30
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,180
so

31
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:43,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

32
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:44,669
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your role in C3 Day?

33
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:54,675
[SPEAKER_00]: So C3 Day, that was like my first big project at Medford High School, and I kind of created the idea for what the seniors were going to do when they were off campus.

34
00:04:54,855 --> 00:05:02,260
[SPEAKER_00]: So I created the idea, created the title, and then really researched all the different opportunities that seniors were going to have.

35
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:10,965
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I think my biggest role was really encouraging them to go big and make this a really meaningful day for them that's going to have an impact on what they do in the future.

36
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you and the guidance Councilors have any future plans for the students?

37
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Future plans for the students?

38
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:35,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think, I've been super impressed with the guidance department being new here and I think the goal is to really help students to understand what do they want their future goals to be, what do they want in the long term for themselves and their families, and then really backward planning with them so if you have this goal in the long term,

39
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:36,975
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have to be doing five years from now?

40
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:39,455
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have to be doing three years from now, one year?

41
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:41,336
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have to be doing a week from now?

42
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:45,158
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have to be doing tomorrow to help you reach your long-term goals?

43
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:45,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

44
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,959
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think your strongest asset is at Medford High School?

45
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:52,124
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty high energy.

46
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:59,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I like really working with a variety of students and I think just being creative with what we can do here.

47
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd actually say my biggest strength is I've been incredibly impressed with the population of faculty and students at Medford High School.

48
00:08:13,195 --> 00:08:18,485
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's something strange in your neighborhood Who you gonna call?

49
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:19,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghostbusters!

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,415
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's something weird and it don't look good

51
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:52,475

[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Halloween, Medford High!

53
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:26,680
[SPEAKER_06]: For some of you seniors, we have a special poem because you have another holiday this weekend.

54
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,381
[SPEAKER_06]: A Halloween haiku written by Cullen Burke.

55
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:32,402
[SPEAKER_06]: The scariest day, it is called deadline day.

56
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:33,663
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Halloween.

57
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,264
