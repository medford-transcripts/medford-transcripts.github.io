00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:05,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening and welcome everyone to tonight's meeting of the Medford Community Development Board.

[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the chair of the board and I'll call the meeting to order.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

5
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:20,228
[SPEAKER_15]: This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

[SPEAKER_15]: A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting, tonight all votes from the Board will be made by roll call.

10
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:14,591

[SPEAKER_15]: Vice Chair Peter Calves?

00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,119
[SPEAKER_15]: And myself, Chair Emily Hedeman is present.

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Danielle, can you please introduce any staff on the call?

32
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:27,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, myself, Daniel, I've been senior planner at the office planning, development, sustainability.

33
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:30,968
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have our director, Alicia hunt.

34
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:36,450
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have our economic development director, along with 1 of our.

35
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:48,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Student interns will be taking minutes tonight, Josh Needleman, and I believe that is everyone that we have with the city tonight.

36
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:54,388
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also have our outside legal counsel, Robin Stein, with us tonight.

37
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

38
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:57,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that, Danielle.

39
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:01,899
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a couple of matters before the board.

40
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,402
[SPEAKER_15]: The first item that we have is 401 Boston Ave.

41
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:09,285
[SPEAKER_15]: This is site plan review for a Dover amendment.

42
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:15,489
[SPEAKER_15]: The public hearing was closed at the January 15th, 2025 meeting.

43
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,592
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we're continuing this evening is the board deliberation.

44
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:30,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Board member Adam Behrens was not present for the January 15th meeting, but he has signed the Mullen roll affidavit, and we do have that on file.

45
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:47,067
[SPEAKER_15]: And just as a reminder, I stated this earlier, but alternate member Ben LaValle is voting as a full member, as we don't have seven full members present, and he has been in attendance for each of the meetings of this case.

46
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:54,493
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, we are opening it up for board deliberation.

47
00:03:54,513 --> 00:04:02,256
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to remind the board that there's a couple questions before us.

48
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:08,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Does this use qualify as protected educational use under the Dover Amendment?

49
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,840
[SPEAKER_15]: And what are reasonable regulations that should be imposed on the use?

50
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,982
[SPEAKER_15]: We did hear a lot of public feedback.

51
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:31,269
[SPEAKER_15]: with resistance to this project, but I just want to remind the board that based on our jurisdiction as the Community Development Board, those are the two questions in front of us today.

52
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:44,216
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, is there any concern or doubt that 401 Boston

53
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:53,496
[SPEAKER_15]: have does not qualify under the Dover Amendment?

54
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:58,697
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have doubts.

55
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:06,879
[SPEAKER_12]: It is clear to me that it qualifies kind of separate from my feelings about the design of the project.

56
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,260
[SPEAKER_12]: It is clear that it is a Dover Amendment use and that has been confirmed by legal counsel to my satisfaction.

57
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:19,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, not only the design, but also the community engagement process has left a lot to be desired.

58
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:28,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And while we do not have public comment at this period, the public is making their feelings very well known, and I do appreciate that.

59
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:41,915
[SPEAKER_15]: And while we may not be able to act fully per your hopes, we still need to do what's right by our board.

60
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:53,915
[SPEAKER_15]: So assuming that... Annie, you're unmuted.

61
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:58,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you have any thoughts on the Dover Amendment aspect of 401 Boston?

62
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:01,739
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

63
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:07,881
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think the Dover Amendment is clear.

64
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Adam, any questions from your rewatch of the hearing?

65
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,631
[SPEAKER_01]: No questions for the public.

66
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:29,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I attended all the previous meetings and then the affidavit, I watched the entire deliberation from the last meeting.

67
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:37,841
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my views are, maybe Annie said it well in the last meeting, there's a spirit of the law and then there's the actual law.

68
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,343
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that where I feel

69
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:50,533
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable is that this just doesn't really feel in the spirit of what the Dover amendment is trying to achieve.

70
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:55,296
[SPEAKER_01]: But that said, I think it's obvious that just does fall under that regulation.

71
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:58,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we're definitely being put in a very uncomfortable position.

72
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

73
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

74
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:20,045
[SPEAKER_12]: So I kind of, I will say that if this were not a Dover amendment case, we would be going back to a whole lot of site plan review, um, without a doubt.

75
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:22,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the kind of, we would, we would not be.

76
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:25,307
[SPEAKER_15]: I could not agree with you more Ari.

77
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:35,752
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, while I, I respect the, the reason for the Dover amendment, um, I think there needs to be a lot more.

78
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:41,571
[SPEAKER_15]: critical thought put into how it is applied.

79
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:45,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Within this community.

80
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:48,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Within any community, I think.

81
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:53,247
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're talking about this specific community, and I think that.

82
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:53,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

83
00:07:56,965 --> 00:08:01,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and maybe I think what Annie is also maybe to read between the lines, too.

84
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:14,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what also I'm uncomfortable by is that perhaps as an ongoing member of this community, there is additional properties that adjoin this community.

85
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:20,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's additional matters that we know that the university will likely bring before the board.

86
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:24,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we would appreciate

87
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:31,796
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a partnership in NSA, just in how that plays out.

88
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:39,464
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll actually even go beyond that, which is to kind of speak directly to Tufts.

89
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:47,253
[SPEAKER_12]: There is the letter of the law, as you are interpreting it, and as I believe our lawyers are interpreting it, too.

90
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,962
[SPEAKER_12]: and also you are members of a community.

91
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:52,764
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love this community.

92
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,785
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love many things about Tufts.

93
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,187
[SPEAKER_12]: I was a part of that community for many years too.

94
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:09,615
[SPEAKER_12]: And being a good partner may not pay immediate dividends in dollars and cents, but it absolutely pays dividends in the short, medium and long-term.

95
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:12,817
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are a community and

96
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:20,586
[SPEAKER_12]: I urge you to take the community's concerns much more seriously than I have seen you do in this particular process.

97
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,749
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we're named the Community Development Board.

98
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Very well said, Ari.

99
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:30,372
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to sit with that for a little bit.

100
00:09:49,858 --> 00:10:09,828
[SPEAKER_15]: So even considering our displeasure with the process, with the project, even recognizing the need for more student housing, my general feeling is that the board will approve it.

101
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:15,075
[SPEAKER_15]: or is leaning towards approving the Dover Amendment use.

102
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:26,041
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I wanna talk about now is if we do approve that Dover Amendment use, what are some reasonable regulations that can be imposed?

103
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:36,467
[SPEAKER_15]: And the two aspects that Tufts has put before us where they want relief,

104
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:46,310
[SPEAKER_15]: from the strict adherence to the zoning ordinance is the location of the parking on campus and the building setbacks.

105
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:56,555
[SPEAKER_15]: I think probably the parking may be the easiest one to agree to.

106
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:58,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Tufts is a campus.

107
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:04,400
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't make sense for them to have parking associated with each building, with each function.

108
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:15,791
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm generally in agreement with a different location for parking.

109
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:27,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Curious if any other board members have any thoughts on that or any reasons why on-site parking should be required.

110
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:46,897
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no objections to the parking as is, something that I think has been percolating and that I don't know how we can incorporate.

111
00:11:48,278 --> 00:12:01,608
[SPEAKER_12]: But some form of enforcement mechanism of the many promises that have been made to make sure that they are carried out to both the letter and the spirit of trying to repair some of the harm that

112
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:04,349
[SPEAKER_12]: It is clear this project will do.

113
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:14,094
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know if this is the moment to discuss that or not, but I kind of as we bringing that up, that is something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about.

114
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:17,535
[SPEAKER_15]: So we do have the draft conditions.

115
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,098
[SPEAKER_15]: That we reviewed at the last meeting.

116
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:25,539
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can review them again and we can add to them.

117
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:27,580
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have our legal counsel here.

118
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:30,762
[SPEAKER_15]: She can guide us, make sure that.

119
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:41,749
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, we're imposing reasonable conditions, but, you know, we can certainly reopen that discussion.

120
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,651
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what board deliberations are for.

121
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:52,454
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can combine it with Tufts' request for the front yard setback relief.

122
00:12:57,957 --> 00:12:59,498
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I can pull up the conditions now.

123
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:11,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and something that I want to incorporate to is some of these longer term commitments, the trees, the kind of parking enforcement, the shuttle.

124
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:15,318
[SPEAKER_12]: the payment of the community funds.

125
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:19,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Once this building is built, we're not going to tear it down.

126
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,579
[SPEAKER_12]: That's wildly outside our scope.

127
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:36,603
[SPEAKER_12]: But what are some enforcement mechanisms we can have that we can put in from the beginning to make sure that the small things that have been able to be won, at least those are insured.

128
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:42,017
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd love to just get some clarification from city staff in terms of that process.

129
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:54,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Just speaking in general, whether it's the Tufts project or not, when the community development board does put conditions on a project, how are those generally enforced?

130
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:01,005
[SPEAKER_15]: And Robin, if you have an answer.

131
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:02,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sure.

132
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't sure if you're directing that to me or to Alicia or Danielle.

133
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:16,227
[SPEAKER_11]: But generally speaking, when a board acting on site plan or special permit or variances is usually a zoning decision with conditions, they would be enforced through the building commissioners, the zoning enforcement officer.

134
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:22,510
[SPEAKER_11]: So if a condition was being violated, usually the first step is either a conversation or a letter.

135
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,392
[SPEAKER_11]: And then eventually, if it's not being complied with, it's something that we might pursue in court.

136
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:28,173
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit different for subdivisions.

137
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:29,753
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why I was just clarifying.

138
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:31,074
[SPEAKER_11]: But something like this that is

139
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:34,735
[SPEAKER_11]: a site plan, the enforcement goes through the building commissioner's office.

140
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:40,437
[SPEAKER_15]: So before they could get their like certificate of occupancy, they would have to fulfill these?

141
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:50,801
[SPEAKER_11]: So anything in the decision that has a specific timing to it has to be on that timing, whether it's before occupancy, before building permit, but then all the other conditions just survive forever.

142
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:54,962
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there's, um, well, if there's other, um,

143
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:10,129
[SPEAKER_11]: If there are other conditions that survive ongoing, like ongoing obligation to have the shuttle or whatever conditions survive past occupancy, those continue to be conditions of the approval.

144
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:17,875
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they were violated, then it would go through the building commissioner's office.

145
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:23,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Danielle, do you have anything to add?

146
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, through the chair.

147
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:37,412
[SPEAKER_09]: As Attorney Stein mentioned, some of the conditions have certain benchmarks when they need to be complete.

148
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:46,814
[SPEAKER_09]: So we like to tie those to the building permit, certificate of occupancy, things like that.

149
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:50,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And so at those different checkpoints, before those are done,

150
00:15:53,038 --> 00:16:09,364
[SPEAKER_09]: the, you know, the building commissioner makes through and will, you know, goes through and checks, will check with the relevant staff who is kind of overseeing that, whether it's the engineering department or our office or the director of traffic, transportation or fire, police, what have you.

151
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:19,368
[SPEAKER_09]: He checks and confirms that we're, that they're all set and that they have met that condition in order to receive whatever it is that they're seeking.

152
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:20,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

153
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:32,214
[SPEAKER_15]: So curious, Ari, if that kind of general process satisfies your question in terms of enforcement.

154
00:16:35,156 --> 00:16:39,758
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I'm kind of trying to remember and my computer is being slow.

155
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:48,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a timeline of how, like, is there a guarantee that the shuttle will run so long as the building is standing or the building is a dorm?

156
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there an end date there for something like the community fund?

157
00:16:53,873 --> 00:17:07,302
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that it was intentionally not put in the city's control so that there was the possibility to individually compensate owners, but kind of what are, what is the public,

158
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:23,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Notification and transparency around what payments are going out on what timeline and how will both we and the many members of the very interest in public know that that's happening as promised.

159
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:31,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I like what you're saying in terms of, I mean, I don't know if it applies for all of these, but how do we make them smart conditions?

160
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:37,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I think you just need to look at the conditions.

161
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:43,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you reviewed them at the last meeting, but you certainly can look at them again now and just make sure that they read the way that you want them to read.

162
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

163
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:52,655
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the only caution I'll give is because the public hearing is closed, an opportunity to kind of discuss those with Tufts has passed.

164
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:55,565
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that you did during the public hearing.

165
00:17:56,566 --> 00:18:04,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Just you want to keep that in mind if you're really dramatically changing anything, but the condition should have the timings associated with them.

166
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:05,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

167
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:11,780
[SPEAKER_11]: But everything survives forever as a condition, so long as the permits being used.

168
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Danielle?

169
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:19,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to mention that

170
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:26,059
[SPEAKER_09]: regarding the community fund, and I'm trying to open up my conditions document too.

171
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:33,663
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that the university conceived of and offered.

172
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:41,847
[SPEAKER_09]: So the city does not want to be closely involved with that.

173
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:41,907
[SPEAKER_09]: So

174
00:18:46,679 --> 00:19:13,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I pretty much we put this in the condition document to like memorialize, that summary of commitments that Tufts made, but this isn't really something that we will be monitoring per se, but I defer to director Hunt and our legal counsel because I, this was between Tufts and the neighborhood and

175
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:16,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to memorialize it.

176
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:28,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if there's summary of what they're offering, if there's anything legally binding that they can do aside from this decision.

177
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:37,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so this is the condition that we're speaking to here.

178
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,222
[SPEAKER_15]: And I am sharing screen, so I might not be able to see people's hands being raised.

179
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:48,785
[SPEAKER_15]: So board members, if you'd like to discuss, just unmute yourself and we'll talk through it.

180
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:56,269
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is me proposing an idea, and I see kind of lots of decision points coming out of it.

181
00:19:56,349 --> 00:20:01,092
[SPEAKER_12]: So kind of fully acknowledging that as I say it,

182
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:14,536
[SPEAKER_12]: do we want to include a reporting mandate here of the Tufts will publish to the public an annual report of the amount spent?

183
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:17,958
[SPEAKER_12]: We can see privacy concerns about the names.

184
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:21,839
[SPEAKER_12]: On the other hand, I think there's a lot of value to transparency.

185
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:24,905
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would put it in here.

186
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:30,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and maybe there's some guidelines or some minimum data points for reporting.

187
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:45,062
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe it says, I don't know, like, type of aid.

188
00:20:45,082 --> 00:20:51,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I know some of the specific comments were around

189
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,622
[SPEAKER_15]: like solar panels and energy generation.

190
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,744
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe there's broad categories.

191
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:14,698
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to be so prescriptive that, you know, we ruminate on this forever, but I like what you're saying in terms of reporting and maybe, yeah.

192
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:20,723
[SPEAKER_10]: What about just reporting on progress of all of the conditions?

193
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:29,058
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, just confirming that the applicant follows through on everything, right?

194
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:50,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, so I don't know what the right wording would be, but something along the lines of, you know, Tufts reports on, yeah, funding disbursement in the case of this community fund, but it'd be good to get like a readout and a confirmation that everything that was agreed to or conditioned

195
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:54,100
[SPEAKER_10]: is actually implemented, right?

196
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, I'd love to have that for all of our projects, to be honest, but especially this one.

197
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:03,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I will say that I think there is value in it being

198
00:22:05,243 --> 00:22:21,154
[SPEAKER_12]: not overly prescriptive, but providing a sufficient minimum detailed guardrail, thus that the leader of the agreement does not allow something like one sentence report in an annual report that says we did the thing.

199
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:28,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think it's also in the, I agree with Ari, and I think it's also in the applicant's interest, right?

200
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:32,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, some of this is sort of best effort type wording, right?

201
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:33,302
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

202
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:44,339
[SPEAKER_10]: if in fact they're unable to meet one of the conditions, but they put forward best effort, it's actually in the applicant's interest to make the public aware of that, right?

203
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:49,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we could say something like, because I know those conditions you're talking about, Ben.

204
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:56,924
[SPEAKER_15]: We could say, what was it?

205
00:22:56,944 --> 00:23:01,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was a tree one was best available.

206
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:02,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Commercially reasonable efforts.

207
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:25,142
[SPEAKER_10]: um I think the public rightfully will you know go back and and check these conditions and if they're you know, if that doesn't happen, I think it's in tufts interest to At least be clear as to what commercially reasonable efforts were made And uh, and just explain it So, I don't I don't know.

208
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:34,006
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know What the best enforcement mechanism is but something along the lines of like, I mean we're talking about 25 conditions some sort of report out

209
00:23:35,302 --> 00:23:39,205
[SPEAKER_10]: on a regular basis once a year or however often we think is appropriate.

210
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:45,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Couldn't hurt.

211
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:50,853
[SPEAKER_15]: What about if not able to fill, they can propose an alternate?

212
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:55,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that too nebulous?

213
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:55,596
[SPEAKER_15]: What do we think?

214
00:23:56,857 --> 00:24:00,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that this is MBTA property, National Grid property.

215
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,761
[SPEAKER_15]: If they can't plant trees there, then

216
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:07,048
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, those sites are kind of.

217
00:24:07,068 --> 00:24:09,129
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a few, there's a few such things, right?

218
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:11,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the blue bike station, right.

219
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:17,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it, you know, probably not entirely in Tufts control to get that installed, right?

220
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:27,099
[SPEAKER_10]: There's, they're going to have to collaborate with other entities in order to make some of these happen.

221
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

222
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,081
[SPEAKER_15]: So this one's a definite.

223
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:41,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I guess there's part of me that's also thinking about ones that will impact people, things like the dedicated ride share.

224
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:47,836
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about enforcement and how they agreed to use TUPD to assist with enforcement.

225
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:57,421
[SPEAKER_12]: But kind of that, things like the shades, they committed that shades will be built in if they stop working, if the students tear them out.

226
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:03,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Students are creative when they don't like their living spaces.

227
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:25,353
[SPEAKER_12]: And while I would love to operate under good faith assumption, I think that much of this process has shown that the neighborhood needs to use its legal rights as much as Tufts has.

228
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:30,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then I think like,

229
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,917
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of from both directions.

230
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:41,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's pretty fair to say I think there's probably a lack of trust with Tufts.

231
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:56,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly feel like it's in Tufts' best interest to have some sort of mechanism to have this synthesized in a way that people don't have to fish around for it, that the decision making was made clear.

232
00:25:56,982 --> 00:26:00,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I do think that the base assumption will be, well,

233
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:06,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Tufts was cutting corners and, you know, they just, they promised up and they never intended to do it.

234
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:18,881
[SPEAKER_15]: What about, I'm thinking of ways that we can kind of combine all these, these, these commitment

235
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:23,205
[SPEAKER_15]: tracking questions that we're having.

236
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:37,888
[SPEAKER_15]: And one thought that just came to mind was maybe there's an annual or biannual listening session where they report on fund disbursement.

237
00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:46,770
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even know if this is possible, but they do an annual audit of blind and shade conditions with student turnover.

238
00:26:51,095 --> 00:27:04,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Emily, that's what I was thinking was actually like an additional condition that basically says we're going to do some sort of readout of the conditions on a regular basis or the status update or something.

239
00:27:04,043 --> 00:27:07,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, that didn't mean to interrupt.

240
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:09,287
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you're good.

241
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:12,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the best way to do that, whether it's a public.

242
00:27:13,594 --> 00:27:20,198
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, public meeting where they just do a status update or whether there's, you know, I don't know the best format.

243
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:21,238
[SPEAKER_10]: So go ahead, Ari.

244
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:22,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

245
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,160
[SPEAKER_12]: I was kind of jumping off of that.

246
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I, I see the value to having a public hearing.

247
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:35,846
[SPEAKER_12]: And also I recognize that, that, that kind of many people have childcare challenges, et cetera, to getting to things.

248
00:27:36,606 --> 00:27:37,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and,

249
00:27:38,677 --> 00:27:41,319
[SPEAKER_12]: They are not obligated to do anything with that feedback.

250
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:59,291
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm kind of, I think part of what I'm imagining, and I don't think this is sufficient, but I think part of it is a written report with like percent and like include something like percent fulfillment of each of these and.

251
00:28:00,628 --> 00:28:21,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Mitigation steps for where it's below an acceptable threshold and I know I'm getting into math and legal terms So pardon me for kind of thinking out loud And I do think having something written submitted to the town and if we can put in something of like if it is

252
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,851
[SPEAKER_12]: not acceptable and that we're just going to put a parenthesis there of that's a separate issue.

253
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:33,592
[SPEAKER_12]: What can the city do to fix that situation?

254
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:45,494
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe it's that and a meeting.

255
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:50,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, I don't think we can have a public

256
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:53,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing because I don't think there'll be anything really to.

257
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:58,088
[SPEAKER_15]: To hear because to your point, we can't.

258
00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:02,231
[SPEAKER_15]: But once these conditions are conditioned.

259
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:07,755
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we part of the reason why.

260
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:18,568
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to put works in quotation marks, but part of the reason why a community development board or planning board or zoning board works is because we have a consistent process.

261
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:24,651
[SPEAKER_15]: And we, you know, we, we hear every matter.

262
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:31,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Along the same guidelines, and we give the applicant.

263
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Something that they can move forward with on their project, so we can't.

264
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:46,153
[SPEAKER_15]: like six months from now, for better or for worse, we can't go back and be like, oh, actually, we wanted X, Y, Z. That's not right.

265
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:54,816
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, we could spend a lot of time talking about what is and isn't right in this topic, but based on the restrictions we have today.

266
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:05,000
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I was starting to do is try to highlight or I guess de-emphasize

267
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:16,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, conditions that are kind of black and dry black and dry black and white cut and dry.

268
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:23,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all it's been already been a long work day, but I'm, I'm happy to be here for this important topic.

269
00:30:25,676 --> 00:30:30,999
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, like, we have a 27, 24 7 contact for construction related questions, but.

270
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:35,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a way we can mimic that for, like, community.

271
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:38,369
[SPEAKER_15]: questions or concerns.

272
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:54,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia.

273
00:30:54,678 --> 00:31:00,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to understand if by that you meant

274
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:20,656
[SPEAKER_03]: during the construction or forever, because I'll just, I don't know if members of the board are aware that the Rico is supposed to be the community contact that whenever there's been a resident concern, I've always been told to tell the resident to contact Rocco office, and it's not 24 by seven.

275
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:28,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have a middle of the night concern, you maybe should be calling the police, not Roscoe.

276
00:31:29,162 --> 00:31:31,323
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just did want to state that that exists.

277
00:31:31,943 --> 00:31:35,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody doesn't know that, I'm sharing that.

278
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:36,907
[SPEAKER_14]: That's helpful.

279
00:31:44,191 --> 00:31:48,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, maybe just to talk it out a little bit.

280
00:31:51,542 --> 00:32:04,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I struggle to see what would sort of come up from a community concern perspective or, you know, there's certain, there's certain points where, um, the community input is valuable because like the ship hasn't sailed.

281
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:05,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

282
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:05,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

283
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:09,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think what's a little bit frustrating as well.

284
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:10,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

285
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:14,160
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, after this, it kind of feels like, okay, the ship sailed and,

286
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:22,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with a lot of these, like, there's a value in the update itself, just for the transparency perspective.

287
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:30,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think, you know, from a community board perspective, well, you know, I think that informs future discussions and all of that.

288
00:32:30,354 --> 00:32:40,178
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's hard for me to see what we really Yeah, like, what would the outcome be for that?

289
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:41,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

290
00:32:42,220 --> 00:33:01,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, it's valuable to and so, yeah, just a response to like, yeah, it's probably not 24 seven, but it's probably some, you know, some type of cadence over the length of the project to be the voice, the concerns and for us to just transparently know, I mean, yeah.

291
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:02,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

292
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:16,274
[SPEAKER_11]: So some Emily, yeah, can I can I just make a suggestion that may be helpful, you know, keeping in mind that this is a Dover use and that you can't openly burden necessarily the condition.

293
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:18,497
[SPEAKER_11]: So things that tops would agree to are great.

294
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:24,102
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know at this point, but you know, I think in my opinion, it'd be reasonably defensible

295
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:29,325
[SPEAKER_11]: to the extent that there are particular conditions that are not going to be easily verifiable, right?

296
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:43,992
[SPEAKER_11]: A construction conditions, the building inspector is easily going to verify, you know, if a tree got planted, but some of the things that, you know, you might, you know, maybe not easily be able to tell if they've been complied with, I think it would be reasonable to have a condition if you guys want to consider this.

297
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:54,260
[SPEAKER_11]: That just says that, you know, once a year, TUS will provide a writing to the board just updating on the status of compliance with say condition 16, 18, 20, whatever they are.

298
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,362
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the board can receive that.

299
00:33:56,822 --> 00:34:00,385
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the board wants to discuss it in a public meeting, they can put it on for discussion.

300
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,768
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the board satisfied that there's compliance, that's great.

301
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:09,112
[SPEAKER_11]: And if not, they can refer to the building commissioner to investigate any kind of, you know, enforcement of the condition.

302
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:09,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

303
00:34:13,604 --> 00:34:23,448
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't think I would put the burden on of everything, because certain building construction conditions, they probably don't need to independently verify that's going to happen in the natural course.

304
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:31,372
[SPEAKER_11]: But if there's a couple that you're concerned with just knowing are accomplished, I think it would be fair to take an approach like that if that's something the board wants to consider.

305
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:33,592
[SPEAKER_15]: How does the rest of that?

306
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:34,973
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that that makes sense.

307
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:41,796
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that aligns with the spirit of the question or the original topic of discussion.

308
00:34:43,135 --> 00:34:45,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Danielle.

309
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.

310
00:34:48,218 --> 00:35:04,306
[SPEAKER_09]: So the intention here is reporting on progress towards these conditions that have an end date to be complied with.

311
00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:06,863
[SPEAKER_09]: The board has all the ones that we don't.

312
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:14,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of these won't even be, you know, come due until they've received their certificate of occupancy and their lodging licenses.

313
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:16,467
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're kind of years off.

314
00:35:17,147 --> 00:35:17,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and that's fine.

315
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:18,587
[SPEAKER_15]: They can come back.

316
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:24,169
[SPEAKER_15]: The Community Development Board should hopefully still be in action, even if the fate has changed.

317
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,570
[SPEAKER_09]: For the perpetual conditions.

318
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:30,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I don't know how

319
00:35:31,947 --> 00:35:40,849
[SPEAKER_09]: that would work because that's not something that we put on other projects to report annually that they.

320
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:55,971
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we could put a specific time period during the construction or maybe until like 12 months after certificate of occupancy.

321
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:59,692
[SPEAKER_15]: So at that point, I'm assuming that the building's been fully leased up.

322
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:08,151
[SPEAKER_15]: The students have moved in, Ubers have picked up, DoorDash has been dropped off.

323
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that the public is the best at

324
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:22,306
[SPEAKER_09]: being the eyes and ears of whether a developer is complying with perpetual conditions.

325
00:36:22,787 --> 00:36:41,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but the developer has already put so much of a burden on the public anyways, just through- No, but I'm just saying that- The last thing I want to do is- Yes, but they don't need to report on- Why don't we talk through the ones that we would potentially want them to report on, and then we can see, does it make sense?

326
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:51,511
[SPEAKER_12]: I, for example, do think it's not something the public should have to do, is to go around and canvas every household to find out, did you receive money?

327
00:36:51,571 --> 00:37:00,852
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it is very reasonable to ask Tufts to, on a regular basis, disclose how much they have paid and to whom.

328
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:11,594
[SPEAKER_15]: So just to help us get organized, I'm going to propose that we highlight conditions that we think should have some sort of reporting aspect to it.

329
00:37:13,578 --> 00:37:14,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Sound like a good approach?

330
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:14,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

331
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:24,789
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are starting off with some kind of like engineering, construction, design related ones.

332
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:26,230
[SPEAKER_15]: These are fairly standard.

333
00:37:28,072 --> 00:37:31,536
[SPEAKER_15]: But board, please speak up if you think any of these should be highlighted.

334
00:37:31,556 --> 00:37:37,982
[SPEAKER_10]: No, those seem.

335
00:37:38,817 --> 00:37:44,463
[SPEAKER_10]: pretty standard and have other entities that have to be involved already anyway, right?

336
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:46,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Building and stuff like that.

337
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:49,529
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I would say the same for the engineering division conditions.

338
00:37:51,291 --> 00:38:00,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, these two, we have infiltration inflow mitigation, um, more water sewer.

339
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:10,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we have the blue bike and the shuttle.

340
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:13,001
[SPEAKER_15]: And just to be clear, I don't want to discuss these now.

341
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,307
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to flag them so we can kind of see the whole collection.

342
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:23,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Does anybody disagree that these are ones that we could have reporting around?

343
00:38:26,248 --> 00:38:26,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I think those are good.

344
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:27,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

345
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:43,397
[SPEAKER_12]: I could also imagine for 14A as part of a report, like the number of calls that were made to TUPD or Medford about that area.

346
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:48,239
[SPEAKER_12]: And if everything's working great, they put in, you know, there were eight calls in a year.

347
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:49,560
[SPEAKER_12]: That's perfectly reasonable.

348
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:52,486
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that they should be recording anyway.

349
00:38:52,526 --> 00:39:00,968
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all very easy to find, but I think that is something that, if the answer is hundreds, the public will then do what the public does.

350
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and I trust that they will.

351
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:06,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's keep going and see if there's others we want to highlight.

352
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:07,929
[SPEAKER_15]: These are health department.

353
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we get into some of the light spillage mitigation.

354
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:18,272
[SPEAKER_15]: We've already talked about a couple of these.

355
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:25,407
[SPEAKER_15]: I highlighted these, but any disagreements here?

356
00:39:25,427 --> 00:39:37,657
[SPEAKER_15]: And this 20, I think, would be similar to what you said for the drop-off count of complaints.

357
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:39,919
[SPEAKER_15]: We have trees.

358
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:48,065
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I would like to add to adding new trees is the caretaking of those trees.

359
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,667
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't water them,

360
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:55,697
[SPEAKER_05]: then the trees will not flourish and we'll just have to go.

361
00:39:55,717 --> 00:40:07,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not cool with the idea that if the trees die per contract, they come back a year later and replant them because we've lost a year of growth.

362
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:14,467
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would rather if they plant trees, they take care of them, water them.

363
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:18,189
[SPEAKER_15]: We can refine that.

364
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:30,216
[SPEAKER_12]: That also includes pruning, fertilizing, disease control, et cetera.

365
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:31,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

366
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:32,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think we can keep that loose.

367
00:40:32,418 --> 00:40:32,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

368
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:37,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Maintain the trees in healthy condition.

369
00:40:38,142 --> 00:40:38,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

370
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:44,547
[SPEAKER_15]: So the other one is Condition 25, the Neighborhood Improvement Fund.

371
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,709
[SPEAKER_15]: We've already talked about that a good amount.

372
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:52,633
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not highlight the City of Medford Affordable Housing Trust Fund, just because it's a one-time donation.

373
00:40:55,549 --> 00:41:04,639
[SPEAKER_15]: They either will or they won't, but they have to per these conditions.

374
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:11,606
[SPEAKER_15]: And then 26 and 27 are draft ones that we may or may not put forth.

375
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:12,808
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

376
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,982
[SPEAKER_15]: So what metrics could we put in here?

377
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:34,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we want to specify the duration of reoccurring annual fees?

378
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:41,536
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is fine because it implies, you know, they pay for it as long as the station's there.

379
00:41:47,542 --> 00:42:11,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we want to include something like if they choose to decommission, they need to communicate to the city and something like, I don't know if in 15 years we're all operating on flying hoverboards, we're not going to be, but like, if it makes sense to put in a flying hoverboard station, fine.

380
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:14,084
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of in the spirit, but I do think that

381
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,748
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to include stuff about hoverboards in here, but I get what you're saying.

382
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:51,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Please do not.

383
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:56,665
[SPEAKER_12]: That was me being totally tired at the end of the day.

384
00:42:56,685 --> 00:42:58,446
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I know, I know.

385
00:42:58,466 --> 00:43:04,350
[SPEAKER_15]: I do appreciate the tone that we have here.

386
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:08,152
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a very impactful thing.

387
00:43:13,495 --> 00:43:15,336
[SPEAKER_15]: So status changes of the doc.

388
00:43:17,112 --> 00:43:38,753
[SPEAKER_15]: station shall be coordinated with the director of traffic and transportation including decommissioning vendor changes including but not limited to any other thoughts here okay

389
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,894
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll read through the rest of them once we get through.

390
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:48,056
[SPEAKER_15]: So Ben, I know that you have mentioned the shuttle service a couple of times.

391
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:50,137
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if you had any initial thoughts there.

392
00:43:50,157 --> 00:43:57,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they suggested that it would operate similarly to one that they run for Davis Square.

393
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:05,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what kind of report out we should

394
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:08,425
[SPEAKER_10]: or even could require.

395
00:44:08,485 --> 00:44:15,570
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also nuance that came up in the last meeting where, you know, it's not a, it's not a year round service.

396
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:17,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I don't know.

397
00:44:17,652 --> 00:44:19,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

398
00:44:19,674 --> 00:44:19,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

399
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:24,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if this one, I think, I think it's a, I think it's a nice condition.

400
00:44:24,297 --> 00:44:27,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's community benefit to the condition.

401
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:34,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I just don't know what the right way to make sure it happens is.

402
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:38,160
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, reporting could be around usage.

403
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:47,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and that may let us know, like, is this, uh, something that makes sense to continue?

404
00:44:47,782 --> 00:44:48,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah.

405
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:48,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

406
00:44:49,222 --> 00:44:50,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

407
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:51,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

408
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, maybe similar to, uh, yeah.

409
00:44:55,323 --> 00:44:58,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, something like, you know,

410
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,961
[SPEAKER_10]: first whatever couple years or year or whatever frequency makes sense.

411
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:13,564
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to put an undue burden on the applicant either but you know they did say that this was something they were comfortable with.

412
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:20,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question about the the actual bus or vehicle.

413
00:45:20,946 --> 00:45:22,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it an EV?

414
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,248
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so sorry Annie I don't want to get into that.

415
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:28,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I think

416
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,451
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just curious.

417
00:45:33,011 --> 00:45:33,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

418
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:40,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Rocco said that it was going to be essentially the same service that they provide to Davis Square.

419
00:45:40,374 --> 00:45:47,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know enough about that service and what types of vehicles it is, but it's probably something we could find out.

420
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so how does that look?

421
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:58,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Reporting on usage, the first 24 months to the CEDB on a biannual

422
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,566
[SPEAKER_15]: twice per year basis.

423
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,808
[SPEAKER_10]: That seems reasonable to me for that condition.

424
00:46:12,828 --> 00:46:14,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to hear other opinions too.

425
00:46:17,648 --> 00:46:19,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, looking at the next one.

426
00:46:19,629 --> 00:46:24,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

427
00:46:59,121 --> 00:46:59,701
[SPEAKER_15]: How does that look?

428
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:03,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Applicant will provide a report on the number of calls.

429
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:12,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I might stick with this first 24 months on a biannual twice per year basis.

430
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:30,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

431
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other thoughts on those?

432
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:38,043
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a little concerned about limiting it to only 24 months.

433
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:38,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

434
00:47:40,712 --> 00:47:46,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, this is a building that's going to be a massive investment for a very long time.

435
00:47:46,795 --> 00:47:51,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm, I think annual after a certain period would be perfectly reasonable.

436
00:47:51,357 --> 00:47:55,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but I am thinking on like the 10 plus year scale on this.

437
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:04,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I, this will continue to impact the community and I do want to make sure that, um, the accountability and transparency continues.

438
00:48:04,504 --> 00:48:06,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, that's.

439
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:11,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you saying that for just for condition 14 or also 13?

440
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:13,920
[SPEAKER_15]: 13 as well.

441
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:14,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

442
00:48:16,422 --> 00:48:17,382
[SPEAKER_15]: What about this language?

443
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:21,746
[SPEAKER_15]: After 24 months, the community development board will reevaluate the frequency of this reporting.

444
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:25,168
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't Robin.

445
00:48:25,228 --> 00:48:26,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we even say something like that?

446
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:28,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is that too nebulous?

447
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:30,933
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I guess I just.

448
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:35,980
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I caution and again, I don't know what TUS will be agreeable or not.

449
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:43,163
[SPEAKER_11]: But that if you're going to put reporting burdens on them, you know, they may push back and say that is a burden on our protected use.

450
00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:49,886
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I do caution as you're putting these on, to give some thought to one, is this information you can obtain otherwise.

451
00:48:49,906 --> 00:48:55,409
[SPEAKER_11]: So for example, I mean, the police, you could ask the police department, you know, TUS doesn't necessarily need to get that information.

452
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:55,489
[SPEAKER_11]: But

453
00:48:57,751 --> 00:49:02,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Also for 14, what is the use of the board having that information?

454
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:03,747
[SPEAKER_11]: The condition is what it is.

455
00:49:04,328 --> 00:49:05,491
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't change it later.

456
00:49:06,294 --> 00:49:08,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, that's the same for all of these.

457
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:10,917
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to address board concerns around.

458
00:49:10,957 --> 00:49:19,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, I'm just pointing it out because obviously, you know, in my role, I want to make sure the board understands that, you know, they could get some pushback or, you know, an appeal of condition.

459
00:49:19,382 --> 00:49:24,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm encouraging you to put them on in a way that, you know, I think is doesn't create an undue burden.

460
00:49:24,665 --> 00:49:32,149
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I just think that it makes sense to balance the utility of the condition with what you could do with that information.

461
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:33,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

462
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:40,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I am less worried about having like data twice a year for the first two years.

463
00:49:40,764 --> 00:49:56,358
[SPEAKER_12]: I think some form of usage has value to the committee in terms of evaluating how, when we're looking at future conditions with Tufts and with other bodies, like how our

464
00:49:57,189 --> 00:50:00,672
[SPEAKER_12]: things that we agree to actually being utilized and what impact does it have on the community?

465
00:50:00,692 --> 00:50:02,753
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that is a genuine function.

466
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:13,601
[SPEAKER_12]: I think in terms of undue burden, having an annual report where all of this is consolidated, these are fairly easy conditions, I think.

467
00:50:14,062 --> 00:50:19,326
[SPEAKER_12]: And if needed, I could rank which ones are kind of most important to me.

468
00:50:21,327 --> 00:50:25,170
[SPEAKER_12]: And kind of the transparency around the Neighborhood Improvement Fund is up there.

469
00:50:27,672 --> 00:50:37,917
[SPEAKER_12]: I think reporting on the utilization of community resources, there is a genuine community interest in that.

470
00:50:39,878 --> 00:50:42,759
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm open to hearing otherwise, but that's where I'm coming from.

471
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:50,023
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that in mind, let's move on to the light spillage mitigation and screening conditions.

472
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,845
[SPEAKER_15]: I honestly don't see any reporting that could be associated with condition 20.

473
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:07,026
[SPEAKER_15]: But I do get that this condition is rather nebulous.

474
00:51:17,068 --> 00:51:23,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking at 21, I mean, this could start to approach.

475
00:51:24,089 --> 00:51:26,710
[SPEAKER_12]: That one I could see being onerous.

476
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Operable kind of does imply they need to work.

477
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:43,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know who's going to check that, but I urge the community to assist in making sure that this gets utilized.

478
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:55,816
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very rare for a student to fill out a conditions of unit report and submit it back to their landowner in reasonable time.

479
00:51:58,905 --> 00:52:02,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see, and then we had some feedback about the trees added.

480
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:24,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think adding and maintained may hit what we're trying to say for maintain for the life of the building.

481
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:39,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

482
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:58,080
[SPEAKER_15]: So, in terms of this community fund,

483
00:53:00,505 --> 00:53:10,951
[SPEAKER_15]: I think if we put in this timing requirement around reporting, there could be the assumption that the board will ask specific questions.

484
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:16,634
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's in Tufts' best interest to come armed with information.

485
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Armed is probably the wrong word.

486
00:53:20,476 --> 00:53:26,800
[SPEAKER_15]: To come prepared with information, and then it can be on the board to dive deeper.

487
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,462
[SPEAKER_15]: in terms of information associated with this.

488
00:53:33,364 --> 00:53:42,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Emily, and again, I don't want to overstep, but the last sentence of this says that the city is going to have no involvement with the establishment or administration of the fund.

489
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:45,252
[SPEAKER_15]: But we can still hear what's happening with the fund.

490
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,914
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're not going to influence it.

491
00:53:47,994 --> 00:53:50,956
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to determine how funds are expended.

492
00:53:50,996 --> 00:53:55,079
[SPEAKER_15]: We just want to hear how this fund is going.

493
00:53:58,609 --> 00:54:09,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Madam Chair, I just make sure that Robin so the concern here from the city is our legal involvement with money that might be going directly to individuals.

494
00:54:10,494 --> 00:54:16,038
[SPEAKER_03]: and we needed to protect the city, which is why we include the statement that the city will have no involvement.

495
00:54:16,058 --> 00:54:25,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanna make sure that anything the board adds on reporting doesn't open the city up for some liability around that just because of the nature of such a thing.

496
00:54:25,725 --> 00:54:28,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, to me reporting is different than administration.

497
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:38,133
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree and I'm also open to wording it in thus a way that the reporting is public or like,

498
00:54:39,186 --> 00:54:39,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

499
00:54:39,766 --> 00:54:51,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Delivered to the city and X so that even if the city, even if we don't aren't able to do anything with it, the public will have clear access to that information.

500
00:54:52,371 --> 00:54:53,711
[SPEAKER_12]: That feels important.

501
00:54:54,051 --> 00:55:03,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, if if the report is submitted to the Community Development Board due to open meeting law, that information is then therefore publicly available.

502
00:55:04,815 --> 00:55:07,196
[SPEAKER_15]: You do have to do a little bit of searching, but

503
00:55:08,783 --> 00:55:10,644
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, it will be available.

504
00:55:10,924 --> 00:55:11,344
[SPEAKER_15]: Danielle.

505
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:13,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

506
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:17,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the most important thing is the transparency aspect.

507
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:22,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that it needs to be reported to us because we're not requiring the fund.

508
00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:24,028
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not involved with the fund.

509
00:55:24,508 --> 00:55:31,190
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to get mixed up with violations of the anti-aid amendment, which is... Who could they report to?

510
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:38,352
[SPEAKER_09]: What if they just posted on, have a webpage associated with this that they regularly update?

511
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:40,408
[SPEAKER_09]: that would be available to everyone.

512
00:55:40,868 --> 00:55:46,651
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're not reporting, they're not submitting reports to the city because we're not involved with this.

513
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:50,452
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want the reports.

514
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,373
[SPEAKER_09]: We just, we want to stay out of it.

515
00:55:52,393 --> 00:55:53,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

516
00:55:54,674 --> 00:56:00,797
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we're curious, we'll just go on their webpage and see what, what, um,

517
00:56:01,365 --> 00:56:02,466
[SPEAKER_09]: where the funds have gone.

518
00:56:03,066 --> 00:56:07,868
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe it could have a little ticker and they could have a pie chart of however they want.

519
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:16,632
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're just writing checks for 10K to every butter who's shaded, then that's what it says on the webpage.

520
00:56:16,652 --> 00:56:21,175
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think we need to be receiving reports.

521
00:56:21,235 --> 00:56:25,857
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if the public wants it, they have to file Freedom of Information Act requests.

522
00:56:26,837 --> 00:56:27,838
[SPEAKER_09]: It comes the whole thing.

523
00:56:27,898 --> 00:56:29,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think we can get,

524
00:56:30,535 --> 00:56:32,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it is it is territory.

525
00:56:32,997 --> 00:56:34,078
[SPEAKER_15]: And I and I hear that.

526
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:42,624
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the applicant will maintain a publicly accessible resource that details fund usage, disbursement?

527
00:56:43,885 --> 00:56:44,785
[SPEAKER_15]: I can delete, et cetera.

528
00:56:46,867 --> 00:56:49,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe updated at least once a year.

529
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:59,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Updated at least once a year until all funds are dispersed, then they don't have to do anything after that.

530
00:57:00,788 --> 00:57:00,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

531
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:03,009
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

532
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:09,534
[SPEAKER_15]: So do we see any reason for the contact line for community-related questions?

533
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:12,856
[SPEAKER_15]: That feels duplicative of Tufts' existing efforts.

534
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:13,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.

535
00:57:14,337 --> 00:57:14,577
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

536
00:57:15,177 --> 00:57:22,642
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have embedded reporting conditions within everything.

537
00:57:22,762 --> 00:57:26,084
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think we can get rid of this one.

538
00:57:26,424 --> 00:57:30,267
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's look back through as a collection of what we've added.

539
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:32,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so we didn't touch those.

540
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:37,320
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this one's fine.

541
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:40,982
[SPEAKER_15]: The blue bikes, status changes shall be coordinated.

542
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:49,325
[SPEAKER_15]: And that should not impose undue burden.

543
00:57:49,345 --> 00:57:51,586
[SPEAKER_15]: And now we get into reporting.

544
00:57:53,566 --> 00:57:54,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Applicant reported reporting.

545
00:58:04,207 --> 00:58:05,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I see it, I see it both ways.

546
00:58:06,589 --> 00:58:08,691
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, what are we going to actually do with this information.

547
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:16,597
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with your sentiment Ari on, you know, it'll help us with the effectiveness of these sort of conditions in the long term.

548
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:43,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, does anybody see any issues with these?

549
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:46,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Two reports a year?

550
00:58:46,581 --> 00:58:55,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess it's two here, two here.

551
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:07,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and then effectively an Excel chart.

552
00:59:11,272 --> 00:59:18,136
[SPEAKER_15]: is undue burden on the applicant, then we've got other problems.

553
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:23,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Any thoughts from the board?

554
00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:24,039
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

555
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:40,149
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to stop sharing.

556
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all for putting up with my typing on screen.

557
00:59:44,952 --> 00:59:45,592
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

558
00:59:49,596 --> 00:59:54,800
[SPEAKER_15]: So just to plug us back into the two questions or the questions that are at hand.

559
00:59:56,242 --> 00:59:59,705
[SPEAKER_15]: One is Dover amendment use.

560
01:00:01,145 --> 01:00:05,167
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know the board is aligned or appears to be aligned.

561
01:00:06,528 --> 01:00:09,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we just talked through the reasonable regulations.

562
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:20,816
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't sound like anybody really had any issue with the parking being not located on site.

563
01:00:22,978 --> 01:00:29,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the other relief that the applicant is asking for is the front yard setbacks.

564
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:31,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia.

565
01:00:32,531 --> 01:00:35,212
[SPEAKER_03]: There were two others, Madam Chair.

566
01:00:35,292 --> 01:00:37,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure that those don't get lost.

567
01:00:38,974 --> 01:00:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I realized that those weren't in the document, but it was around having a primary building in the rear yard and then having multiple buildings on a single lot.

568
01:00:54,181 --> 01:00:56,142
[SPEAKER_15]: So those have not been in any of the documents.

569
01:00:57,919 --> 01:00:59,400
[SPEAKER_03]: They were in their application.

570
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:13,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually, honestly, I asked, I think Robin had a suggestion for us that we should just approve the application as submitted and that that, because these are not waivers the way not one normally does a waiver.

571
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:25,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you just approve the application as submitted, then it encompasses the project as it was presented to you without having to worry about any of the individual

572
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:28,534
[SPEAKER_03]: things.

573
01:01:43,644 --> 01:01:52,650
[SPEAKER_03]: The one about having a primary building in the backyard was essentially, it was discussed once at the very beginning.

574
01:01:52,670 --> 01:02:00,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was pointed out that it didn't make any sense for this project or any Tufts project because they're on a campus.

575
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:05,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it just came through very quickly as, oh, right, of course not.

576
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this is multiple, and this is the backyard of another building.

577
01:02:11,976 --> 01:02:16,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And our zoning was changed around the multiple buildings on a lot.

578
01:02:17,178 --> 01:02:20,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So in some zones, it's allowed by special permit by the CD board.

579
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,201
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so sorry.

580
01:02:22,221 --> 01:02:25,382
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to have to declare a quick recess.

581
01:02:27,823 --> 01:02:31,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's reconvene back in five minutes.

582
01:02:34,987 --> 01:02:35,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

583
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:39,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, everyone.

584
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:40,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for your patience.

585
01:02:40,993 --> 01:02:44,154
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to get started in a couple of minutes.

586
01:02:44,174 --> 01:02:46,756
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to wait for board members to come back on screen.

587
01:02:58,661 --> 01:03:00,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Sabrina, can you just throw your screen on when you get back?

588
01:03:01,423 --> 01:03:01,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

589
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:02,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

590
01:03:02,803 --> 01:03:04,664
[SPEAKER_15]: We got Annie, Ben, Adam.

591
01:03:05,124 --> 01:03:05,404
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

592
01:03:05,524 --> 01:03:05,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

593
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:05,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

594
01:03:06,845 --> 01:03:06,885
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

595
01:03:11,802 --> 01:03:30,886
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wanted to get a little bit more detail about those two other items that were just mentioned, more than one building on a single lot, and then related to the back building.

596
01:03:32,546 --> 01:03:36,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Danielle, can you give us a little bit more background on those?

597
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:44,424
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure that we as a board are going in fully understanding.

598
01:03:44,444 --> 01:04:07,898
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would compare this to the same issues with you have a campus and there are multiple buildings on a campus and there are kind of some quirky things in our ordinance that have always been there, things that were changed and there were unintended consequences and then

599
01:04:08,576 --> 01:04:13,520
[SPEAKER_09]: amendments to kind of fix those unintended consequences that didn't quite quite fix them.

600
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're hoping maybe in the next round of phase would fix them.

601
01:04:16,622 --> 01:04:25,809
[SPEAKER_09]: But basically, it's in most of the zoning districts, not more than two structures is allowed on a lot.

602
01:04:29,192 --> 01:04:34,656
[SPEAKER_09]: That was in response to some historic preservation concerns.

603
01:04:38,446 --> 01:04:41,247
[SPEAKER_09]: with tear downs and building multiple buildings.

604
01:04:41,327 --> 01:04:50,771
[SPEAKER_09]: So at one point there was an amendment that was passed at some point, not allowing that.

605
01:04:52,752 --> 01:05:02,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we tried to fix it so that you could build more than two structures on a lot by right in most zoning districts.

606
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:12,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia, I may need you to call up that language because I don't have the most amended.

607
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:16,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this is in the apartment one zone, which I'm pretty sure.

608
01:05:16,697 --> 01:05:21,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't we just pause with that description and see if board members have any questions?

609
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,601
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes sense to me.

610
01:05:24,522 --> 01:05:26,483
[SPEAKER_15]: This was a regulation that was passed.

611
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:40,594
[SPEAKER_15]: has a good idea, and then the actual implementation of it is a challenge, which is why it is before us today, those two specific ones.

612
01:05:49,797 --> 01:05:50,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

613
01:05:51,918 --> 01:05:54,599
[SPEAKER_15]: The board has no questions on those two.

614
01:05:54,619 --> 01:05:54,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Then,

615
01:06:00,532 --> 01:06:03,873
[SPEAKER_12]: I am thinking through this out loud.

616
01:06:04,654 --> 01:06:09,856
[SPEAKER_12]: I will share that I did not understand that these were also things that we needed to approve.

617
01:06:09,896 --> 01:06:17,739
[SPEAKER_12]: My understanding was that the only options we had were Dover amendment, the parking and the setback.

618
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:22,501
[SPEAKER_12]: This seems to be in line with some of the concerns.

619
01:06:22,581 --> 01:06:24,982
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems to not be a boilerplate issue.

620
01:06:25,592 --> 01:06:30,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I think it sounds like having a large building is, in fact, the intent.

621
01:06:30,816 --> 01:06:34,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Or like, not having a large building is, in fact, the intent of that ordinance.

622
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I misunderstanding?

623
01:06:36,161 --> 01:06:38,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia, I would love to hear more detail.

624
01:06:38,663 --> 01:06:41,245
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually completely misunderstanding.

625
01:06:42,346 --> 01:06:42,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely.

626
01:06:45,308 --> 01:06:47,108
[SPEAKER_03]: have Robin explain it.

627
01:06:47,288 --> 01:07:00,652
[SPEAKER_03]: The one about multiple buildings is that it used to say in our zoning that in any district, two principal structures shall not be permitted on the same lot other than in the Muzz district.

628
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:07,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And we said, that's crazy, because that makes all kinds of things illegal.

629
01:07:07,843 --> 01:07:11,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you would want multiple buildings on a single lot in many cases.

630
01:07:12,104 --> 01:07:20,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we went to change the language, the language that we included accidentally left the word not in.

631
01:07:20,887 --> 01:07:26,431
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, so the new language said are not permitted when the change was supposed to be are permitted.

632
01:07:27,492 --> 01:07:34,536
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd really like to, so that wasn't in fact at all, it had nothing to do with preventing Tufts or anybody from doing these things.

633
01:07:36,378 --> 01:07:36,518
[SPEAKER_03]: The

634
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:48,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the project has been presented to the board in a lot of detail, and that I hope you understand the project.

635
01:07:49,513 --> 01:07:51,255
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a 40B project.

636
01:07:51,315 --> 01:07:54,759
[SPEAKER_03]: A 40B project, one has to approve every single waiver.

637
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,962
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a project where one approves the waivers.

638
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:02,106
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a project where one approves the project as it is.

639
01:08:02,887 --> 01:08:14,558
[SPEAKER_03]: If the board were to put any conditions on it, the only conditions that would be allowable are ones that are where they're going outside of our zoning.

640
01:08:16,368 --> 01:08:24,334
[SPEAKER_03]: To say that they can't put multiple buildings on a lot is actually completely would be silly because they're a campus.

641
01:08:24,674 --> 01:08:25,855
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it works.

642
01:08:27,156 --> 01:08:39,685
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one was around not having a building in the backyard of another building, which honestly, I didn't even realize was in our zoning until they called it out in their application.

643
01:08:41,487 --> 01:08:42,727
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never come up before.

644
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:47,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was sort of where we were kind of going with this.

645
01:08:48,911 --> 01:09:01,778
[SPEAKER_03]: My concern was that if you approve it with two specific exceptions to zoning, you're approving not necessarily what they presented and you're unintentionally putting conditions on it.

646
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:30,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So the recommendation from the legal counsel, who I think can speak for herself, but she was limited availability after eight o'clock, was to make a motion to approve the application as revised through the January 15th, subject to the conditions discussed, and then make specific findings why it's Dover and why the site plan prevents reasonable application of the zoning ordinance to this project.

647
01:09:33,079 --> 01:09:35,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that clear?

648
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:43,223
[SPEAKER_12]: That is much clearer.

649
01:09:48,306 --> 01:09:53,868
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, there are four items of relief.

650
01:09:55,409 --> 01:10:00,931
[SPEAKER_15]: But the two that would actually have an impact are parking and setback.

651
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:06,453
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the other items of relief is due to literally a typo.

652
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:23,085
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the other is this weird back building thing, which may also have been included in error.

653
01:10:23,105 --> 01:10:26,048
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm less concerned with those two.

654
01:10:27,809 --> 01:10:28,870
[SPEAKER_15]: We've talked about parking.

655
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:31,512
[SPEAKER_15]: We have not touched on setback.

656
01:10:35,427 --> 01:10:39,028
[SPEAKER_15]: So if it's all right with the board, I'd like to just kind of socialize setback.

657
01:10:39,269 --> 01:10:52,695
[SPEAKER_15]: And we did see presentation from the applicant reviewing the difference between what is required for setback and what they're proposing for setback.

658
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:58,918
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if board members have any thoughts on those.

659
01:11:05,737 --> 01:11:08,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the impact is minor.

660
01:11:08,978 --> 01:11:19,622
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, what the public really wants is a shorter building and a better community engagement process, and these setbacks are not it.

661
01:11:42,044 --> 01:11:53,249
[SPEAKER_15]: So does anybody have any reluctance to the relief for the front yard setbacks?

662
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:02,493
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

663
01:12:03,353 --> 01:12:03,633
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

664
01:12:06,074 --> 01:12:07,055
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I'd be looking for.

665
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:14,692
[SPEAKER_15]: is a motion to approve the application as submitted with conditions.

666
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:28,084
[SPEAKER_15]: If a member of the board is not comfortable making that motion, I'm happy to make it myself.

667
01:12:35,536 --> 01:12:41,518
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so I will make a motion to approve the application as submitted with conditions.

668
01:12:41,538 --> 01:12:42,858
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking for a second.

669
01:12:46,559 --> 01:12:47,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I will second that.

670
01:12:48,179 --> 01:12:48,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

671
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:55,561
[SPEAKER_15]: We are going to do a roll call vote.

672
01:12:55,581 --> 01:12:57,322
[SPEAKER_15]: I am going to vote first.

673
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:01,903
[SPEAKER_15]: I, Chair Emily Henneman, am an aye.

674
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:06,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Sabrina Alpino.

675
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:13,059
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Sabrina, you cut out.

676
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,220
OK.

677
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:17,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Adam Behrens.

678
01:13:19,203 --> 01:13:19,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

679
01:13:21,604 --> 01:13:22,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Annie Strang.

680
01:13:25,046 --> 01:13:25,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

681
01:13:27,307 --> 01:13:27,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Ben LaValle.

682
01:13:28,608 --> 01:13:30,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

683
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:34,951
[SPEAKER_15]: And Ari Goffman Fishman.

684
01:13:41,773 --> 01:13:44,854
[SPEAKER_12]: There are enough eyes that it already passed, so I'll abstain.

685
01:13:44,874 --> 01:13:53,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

686
01:13:53,817 --> 01:14:00,560
[SPEAKER_15]: So with great reluctance, the motion passes.

687
01:14:03,281 --> 01:14:09,143
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope to never see a project like this in front of us ever again with this sort of horrible,

688
01:14:10,349 --> 01:14:11,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Community engagement.

689
01:14:15,113 --> 01:14:16,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Horrible community engagement.

690
01:14:16,714 --> 01:14:19,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Totally agree.

691
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:20,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Be a better neighbor.

692
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,101
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that, we're going to move on to our next matter.

693
01:14:41,011 --> 01:14:44,914
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to thank members of the public for showing up consistently.

694
01:14:50,599 --> 01:14:57,264
[SPEAKER_15]: So the next item that we have is the bridal path definitive subdivision.

695
01:14:58,245 --> 01:14:59,446
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a continued hearing.

696
01:14:59,466 --> 01:15:03,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have a member of the applicant team here?

697
01:15:03,169 --> 01:15:06,071
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Attorney Desmond has been

698
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:11,110
[SPEAKER_15]: representing the applicant.

699
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:13,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Chair, I do see that she is here.

700
01:15:13,873 --> 01:15:14,694
[SPEAKER_15]: I see her as well.

701
01:15:14,714 --> 01:15:16,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Just asked her to unmute.

702
01:15:18,799 --> 01:15:19,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I in?

703
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:19,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

704
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:22,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we can Attorney Desmond.

705
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:24,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm using one of those new

706
01:15:25,733 --> 01:15:31,076
[SPEAKER_04]: angled connectors that allows us all to speak and I just wanted to make sure it worked.

707
01:15:31,576 --> 01:15:32,117
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you.

708
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:34,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

709
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:40,321
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Attorney Desmond, do you have any updated plans or documents to present?

710
01:15:40,822 --> 01:15:41,242
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.

711
01:15:42,183 --> 01:15:46,885
[SPEAKER_04]: We received two memos from the engineering department, January 17, 2025 and January 27.

712
01:15:50,377 --> 01:15:57,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did update our plans to comply with those requests.

713
01:15:57,184 --> 01:16:04,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I can share my screen, I will bring up that plan.

714
01:16:07,035 --> 01:16:08,096
[SPEAKER_04]: So can everybody see that?

715
01:16:08,775 --> 01:16:09,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

716
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:21,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so so basically there were four buckets of items that the city engineer required us to look at the first being areas to be clear of vertical obstructions.

717
01:16:22,505 --> 01:16:26,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So that could accommodate fire apparatus along the cul-de-sac.

718
01:16:27,388 --> 01:16:34,894
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll note that these are the three areas they're marked on the plans that need to be clear of obstructions.

719
01:16:35,954 --> 01:16:36,575
[SPEAKER_04]: We have

720
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:43,042
[SPEAKER_04]: removed two trees from that area in accordance with the request to keep vertical obstructions out of that area.

721
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:50,487
[SPEAKER_04]: We agreed to provide language in the HOA to ensure that going forward no vertical obstructions are located within the area.

722
01:16:50,907 --> 01:16:53,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did confirm with the city engineer that the

723
01:16:53,649 --> 01:17:02,431
[SPEAKER_04]: utilities being brought in on Bridal Path will be underground, so there shouldn't be any issue with regard to construction in that area.

724
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:14,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've also noted that we'll make sure that all of the utility companies are aware that vertical obstructions cannot be located in those areas due to fire access.

725
01:17:15,154 --> 01:17:20,597
[SPEAKER_04]: The second bucket essentially of requests dealt with curbing and sidewalks.

726
01:17:20,737 --> 01:17:28,081
[SPEAKER_04]: The engineer had requested that we modify the plan and extend the sidewalk and granite curbing southward along Franklin Avenue.

727
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:31,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has been done on the plan.

728
01:17:31,803 --> 01:17:34,324
[SPEAKER_04]: The third area of concern was driveways.

729
01:17:34,904 --> 01:17:40,447
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a need to confirm that the driveway apron materials will be cement concrete.

730
01:17:40,827 --> 01:17:42,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you see on the plan,

731
01:17:42,792 --> 01:17:54,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Each of those driveways is detailed as containing bit concrete and there is also on the legend, a legend so that can be easily seen on the plan.

732
01:17:55,749 --> 01:18:01,072
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to that, we had to adjust the width of the driveway apron for lot 7.

733
01:18:01,872 --> 01:18:06,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Inadvertently, it was greater than the allowed width of 20 feet.

734
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:10,756
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last set of concerns dealt with signage.

735
01:18:11,977 --> 01:18:24,223
[SPEAKER_04]: The city engineer wanted us to incorporate the legend and the markers which were in the traffic report, and that has been done, as you'll see over here, and then relocate and adjust

736
01:18:24,884 --> 01:18:30,826
[SPEAKER_04]: signage for Winthrop Street property so as not to interfere with the ADA access to the sidewalk.

737
01:18:30,846 --> 01:18:33,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did adjust the location of the sign.

738
01:18:34,207 --> 01:18:39,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that addressed all of the engineer's concerns that in the two memos that he had provided to us.

739
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:52,653
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to that, we also did provide staff with a proposed certificate of approval and also a covenant, a draft covenant to review.

740
01:18:57,822 --> 01:18:58,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that.

741
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:01,324
[SPEAKER_15]: I see Danielle has her hand raised.

742
01:19:01,944 --> 01:19:02,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Danielle?

743
01:19:02,564 --> 01:19:02,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

744
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:03,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

745
01:19:05,606 --> 01:19:12,969
[SPEAKER_09]: So the draft certificate of approval that Attorney Desmond had prepared was provided in your packets.

746
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:15,210
[SPEAKER_09]: However, we are

747
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:22,431
[SPEAKER_09]: proposing a few changes to that, that the applicant has agreed to.

748
01:19:23,271 --> 01:19:28,313
[SPEAKER_09]: One of those is with the second condition about blasting.

749
01:19:30,954 --> 01:19:46,560
[SPEAKER_09]: So they wanted to be able to blast, even though they didn't think they needed to blast, but given the history with the adjacent subdivision, we want to have a no blasting condition, but with,

750
01:19:48,963 --> 01:20:06,519
[SPEAKER_09]: leaving the option for the developer to come back to the CD board if there is some extenuating circumstance where they absolutely must blast rather than perform chipping.

751
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:14,346
[SPEAKER_09]: They would have to make an argument, but we wanted to keep that open, but that the default would not be to just, you know,

752
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:28,152
[SPEAKER_09]: start blasting things, because that's probably easier, but could be more damaging to neighboring foundations and also PTSD and all that stuff.

753
01:20:28,612 --> 01:20:29,633
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not fun to be next to.

754
01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:32,315
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was another condition.

755
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:45,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so for the covenant, that won't be signed until after the appeal period tolls.

756
01:20:46,307 --> 01:20:47,487
[SPEAKER_09]: when you would endorse the plan.

757
01:20:47,507 --> 01:20:56,189
[SPEAKER_09]: So tonight you would only be voting to approve the application for the definitive site plan, not endorsing or signing anything until the appeal period tolls.

758
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:07,992
[SPEAKER_09]: So we were, I was advised by legal who I was talking to, I had hoped that Robin would still be on, but that took a little bit longer to help with.

759
01:21:08,883 --> 01:21:26,856
[SPEAKER_09]: making sure everything was included in this, but she was comfortable that subdivision control law requires a surety or some kind of legal instrument or bond that would ensure that the road and the utilities are completed.

760
01:21:26,876 --> 01:21:31,179
[SPEAKER_09]: And that could be determined after.

761
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:36,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And that it's pretty much

762
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:40,781
[SPEAKER_09]: the applicant's choice how they want to provide that.

763
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:53,314
[SPEAKER_09]: So with the no blasting condition, except if they come back and get permissions, those are the only changes to the application.

764
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,493
[SPEAKER_09]: certificate of approval that I had.

765
01:21:57,013 --> 01:22:00,157
[SPEAKER_09]: And Kathy, do you recall anything else that we had discussed?

766
01:22:00,618 --> 01:22:02,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Things are starting to get a little jumbled.

767
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:07,146
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a lot of last minute information I was trying to synthesize today.

768
01:22:07,607 --> 01:22:09,590
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I missed anything, please let me know.

769
01:22:10,471 --> 01:22:24,441
[SPEAKER_04]: We did discuss a construction management plan acceptable satisfactory to the building commissioner and in that regard, Danielle, if we leave it satisfactory to the building commissioner, rather than all of the details, I think.

770
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:33,000
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the plan and the covenant provides that the roadway gets built first and utilities get installed prior to release of the lots.

771
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:36,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what his concern was within sequencing.

772
01:22:36,602 --> 01:22:48,030
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we leave it to his satisfaction or satisfactory, then if it is still a concern in terms of sequencing of what lots get built, then he can he can indicate it's not satisfactory.

773
01:22:48,711 --> 01:22:48,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

774
01:22:49,071 --> 01:22:50,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for reminding me.

775
01:22:51,233 --> 01:22:53,915
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is condition number

776
01:22:55,729 --> 01:22:56,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is that?

777
01:22:59,871 --> 01:23:01,511
[SPEAKER_09]: But the construction management plan.

778
01:23:04,933 --> 01:23:08,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that I don't know that we had that in the draft.

779
01:23:11,115 --> 01:23:12,756
[SPEAKER_04]: The draft certificate of approval.

780
01:23:14,677 --> 01:23:20,999
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know that we have no objection to that being added and changing the language to the blasting on the blasting.

781
01:23:25,165 --> 01:23:30,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe it was included in the original.

782
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:43,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also noticed, and I had sent you an email during the meeting, that number 27 of the conditions actually addresses the issue with performance guarantee.

783
01:23:43,217 --> 01:23:46,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that covers it.

784
01:23:46,559 --> 01:23:48,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It basically mirrors the statute.

785
01:23:49,041 --> 01:23:49,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

786
01:23:49,421 --> 01:23:49,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

787
01:23:50,162 --> 01:23:50,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

788
01:23:55,608 --> 01:24:00,912
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, through the chair, apologies, chair, that we're hashing this out.

789
01:24:03,113 --> 01:24:19,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so the modification to condition two about the blasting, and then another condition requiring the submission of a construction management plan prior to issuance of a, what should be building permit or,

790
01:24:23,867 --> 01:24:29,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Danielle, I don't believe that's for construction of the roadway and the construction in total.

791
01:24:30,208 --> 01:24:37,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the commissioner's concern dealt with the easement and access to the easement that would be within all of the construction.

792
01:24:37,609 --> 01:24:44,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So no permits will issue until a satisfactory construction management plan has been filed with the building commissioner.

793
01:24:48,531 --> 01:24:50,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And my apologies, Madam Chair.

794
01:24:50,572 --> 01:24:52,072
[SPEAKER_09]: So the document

795
01:24:54,643 --> 01:25:01,710
[SPEAKER_09]: is called the draft certificate of approval.

796
01:25:02,911 --> 01:25:03,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

797
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:11,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

798
01:25:13,862 --> 01:25:14,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Got it.

799
01:25:17,165 --> 01:25:17,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

800
01:25:18,006 --> 01:25:18,827
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like familiar now.

801
01:25:42,052 --> 01:25:46,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so I'm going to open it up to the board for questions and comments.

802
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:56,924
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we will open the public comment period.

803
01:25:56,944 --> 01:26:01,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that the public comment period was closed.

804
01:26:05,892 --> 01:26:07,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think we did.

805
01:26:09,572 --> 01:26:12,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't recall if we closed it or if we just closed it.

806
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:15,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think he closed the public hearing.

807
01:26:15,056 --> 01:26:17,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was just the period for that day.

808
01:26:17,597 --> 01:26:37,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had asked the question at that point because we were at the point where it was only whether or not the engineer had provided and you had comments that were standing and we asked at that point whether the public comment period for the project had closed and I believe

809
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:51,434
[SPEAKER_04]: that the board indicated that in fact it had, because we were at deliberation and we couldn't address the comments because it was an internal memo from engineering to staff and to the board.

810
01:26:53,095 --> 01:26:53,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, no, we have not.

811
01:26:54,596 --> 01:26:59,598
[SPEAKER_15]: We did receive a couple public comments the first time you all came in front of us.

812
01:27:00,278 --> 01:27:04,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't believe we've received many additional more.

813
01:27:06,887 --> 01:27:08,128
[SPEAKER_15]: the meeting on the 15th.

814
01:27:08,809 --> 01:27:13,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have draft meeting minutes that you could check?

815
01:27:16,214 --> 01:27:17,075
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going through.

816
01:27:19,196 --> 01:27:20,937
[SPEAKER_09]: That was January 15th.

817
01:27:21,418 --> 01:27:23,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have them for January 15th.

818
01:27:29,964 --> 01:27:31,245
[SPEAKER_09]: There might be an AI summary.

819
01:27:31,285 --> 01:27:32,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there was an AI summary.

820
01:27:56,175 --> 01:28:00,836
[SPEAKER_09]: And we could see if there is anybody here that wanted to speak on this matter.

821
01:28:00,856 --> 01:28:01,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And if not.

822
01:28:08,077 --> 01:28:11,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I just want to respect the process for the applicant as well.

823
01:28:13,098 --> 01:28:16,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, sorry, Kathy, I accidentally muted you.

824
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:17,099
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't need to do that.

825
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:20,760
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

826
01:28:26,898 --> 01:28:29,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Danielle, are you able to reference the AI notes?

827
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking for the email.

828
01:28:31,881 --> 01:28:32,521
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, thank you.

829
01:28:35,003 --> 01:28:42,367
[SPEAKER_15]: In the meantime, do any members of the board have any questions or comments for the applicant related to the updates?

830
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:50,872
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that the no blasting is a very thoughtful change, especially considering the impacts to that neighborhood for adjacent projects.

831
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:55,375
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the other updates I've seen, so thank you.

832
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:48,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, it's not specific enough.

833
01:29:48,932 --> 01:29:54,135
[SPEAKER_09]: It just says that we continued the public hearing, but that might've been a semantics thing.

834
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:55,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

835
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:07,524
[SPEAKER_09]: So the board voted to continue the hearing to February 5th to allow time for the applicant city staff to address the engineer's comments.

836
01:30:08,283 --> 01:30:21,686
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm leaning towards reopening the public comment, just because if there were changes made by the engineer, we would want some opportunity to comment on those.

837
01:30:21,766 --> 01:30:32,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that the applicant has been very reasonable with public comment, and I don't think that there has been a lot of

838
01:30:35,964 --> 01:30:43,330
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the changes that we could have implemented through conditions have been addressed in some way.

839
01:30:44,651 --> 01:30:53,899
[SPEAKER_15]: But I do want to make sure that we are procedurally not leaving anything open.

840
01:30:59,804 --> 01:31:02,586
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know it's a risk, so I appreciate

841
01:31:06,217 --> 01:31:07,542
[SPEAKER_15]: you all taking this risk with me.

842
01:31:14,499 --> 01:31:22,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so seeing no questions or comments from the board, I'm going to now open the public comment period.

843
01:31:23,684 --> 01:31:28,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand function or message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.

844
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:33,389
[SPEAKER_15]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

845
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:37,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

846
01:31:37,111 --> 01:31:39,433
[SPEAKER_15]: I will remind you as well.

847
01:31:40,473 --> 01:31:49,017
[SPEAKER_15]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members, as it's not part of the public record.

848
01:31:49,397 --> 01:31:54,639
[SPEAKER_15]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, you can message staff for assistance.

849
01:31:55,179 --> 01:31:56,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, that's Danielle and Alicia.

850
01:31:57,860 --> 01:32:02,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Each participant will have two minutes to speak, and you will have an opportunity to speak once.

851
01:32:03,022 --> 01:32:06,624
[SPEAKER_15]: If you do have additional comments beyond the time or in addition to your

852
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:17,589
[SPEAKER_15]: first and only comment, then you can email those to ocdmedford-ma.gov.

853
01:32:17,609 --> 01:32:25,655
[SPEAKER_15]: So if anybody has public comments related to the Bridal Path Definitive Subdivision, please raise your hand.

854
01:32:25,675 --> 01:32:32,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia, are you seeing any hands, any comments?

855
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:36,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you received any new emails that have come through?

856
01:32:39,391 --> 01:32:42,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam chair, so it's out loud and people can hear.

857
01:32:42,573 --> 01:32:45,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I also don't see any hands raised.

858
01:32:45,515 --> 01:32:50,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't received any chat messages and there are no new emails in our mailbox.

859
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:54,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

860
01:32:57,662 --> 01:33:05,927
[SPEAKER_15]: So seeing no public comments, I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting as well as for this matter.

861
01:33:08,652 --> 01:33:10,854
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm going to reopen it to the board for deliberation.

862
01:33:10,874 --> 01:33:18,121
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we didn't have any questions or comments, but are there any conditions we want to go over?

863
01:33:18,141 --> 01:33:27,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of playing clerk and chair in this meeting, but I can bring up the conditions.

864
01:33:27,449 --> 01:33:28,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Where did I just have them?

865
01:33:29,852 --> 01:33:31,073
[SPEAKER_15]: If we want to pop through those.

866
01:33:48,332 --> 01:33:55,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to confirm, Danielle and Alicia, these feature the conditions that we were just speaking about.

867
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:56,477
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw the blasting.

868
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:59,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Where is it?

869
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:01,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Which one is it?

870
01:34:01,321 --> 01:34:04,783
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's about the same one.

871
01:34:14,349 --> 01:34:15,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so you'll see here.

872
01:34:17,288 --> 01:34:19,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, item two, no blasting.

873
01:34:20,469 --> 01:34:22,790
[SPEAKER_15]: If they do, they have to return to the community development board.

874
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:25,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, construction management plan.

875
01:34:25,871 --> 01:34:29,032
[SPEAKER_09]: You might want to, you can refresh.

876
01:34:29,072 --> 01:34:43,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'd have to redo the number in, but I, for the construction management, Helen, I put the applicant shall submit a construction management plan for approval from the building commissioner prior to commencement of any construction activities.

877
01:34:44,136 --> 01:34:44,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

878
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:49,183
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be wordsmith a little bit if put it in better legalese.

879
01:34:50,164 --> 01:34:50,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

880
01:34:50,805 --> 01:34:54,128
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not able to edit on the web, so I've been downloading them.

881
01:34:57,071 --> 01:34:59,273
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think I just didn't have the latest download.

882
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:00,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me try that again.

883
01:35:00,374 --> 01:35:09,863
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll share a new window.

884
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:17,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks to everyone's patience with that.

885
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:22,004
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, so we got the construction management plan.

886
01:35:22,024 --> 01:35:32,490
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to ignore the numbers for now.

887
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:38,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Right away, lighting, sidewalk.

888
01:35:39,174 --> 01:35:42,116
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

889
01:35:44,163 --> 01:35:47,846
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't see if any members of the board have their hands raised or are unmuted.

890
01:35:49,748 --> 01:35:57,614
[SPEAKER_15]: But please unmute yourself and speak if you have any questions or comments for these conditions for bridal path.

891
01:35:59,456 --> 01:36:00,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any, Emily.

892
01:36:01,858 --> 01:36:02,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Annie.

893
01:36:07,422 --> 01:36:13,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of these are extremely technical and are from city staff.

894
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:38,406
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

895
01:36:38,426 --> 01:36:44,608
[SPEAKER_15]: So questions for the poll, or I'm sorry, questions for the board.

896
01:36:44,628 --> 01:36:46,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we feel like we're ready to vote?

897
01:36:47,888 --> 01:36:54,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any information that we're looking for to help educate us, inform our decision?

898
01:36:56,518 --> 01:36:58,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a proposal should be made to vote.

899
01:36:59,580 --> 01:36:59,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

900
01:37:01,321 --> 01:37:06,805
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd be looking for a motion to approve the application for a definitive subdivision subject to conditions.

901
01:37:08,146 --> 01:37:09,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I make that motion.

902
01:37:09,867 --> 01:37:10,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Manny.

903
01:37:10,828 --> 01:37:11,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking for a second.

904
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:15,271
[SPEAKER_15]: I can second.

905
01:37:16,091 --> 01:37:16,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Sabrina can have it.

906
01:37:17,712 --> 01:37:18,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Sabrina.

907
01:37:22,736 --> 01:37:24,637
[SPEAKER_15]: We are going to do a roll call vote.

908
01:37:30,223 --> 01:37:31,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Ari Gottman-Fishman.

909
01:37:33,105 --> 01:37:33,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

910
01:37:34,385 --> 01:37:35,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Sabrina Alpino.

911
01:37:35,286 --> 01:37:36,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

912
01:37:37,527 --> 01:37:38,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Adam Behrens.

913
01:37:39,068 --> 01:37:39,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

914
01:37:40,008 --> 01:37:40,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Annie Strang.

915
01:37:41,289 --> 01:37:41,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

916
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:43,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Ben LaValle.

917
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:44,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

918
01:37:45,131 --> 01:37:47,772
[SPEAKER_15]: And myself, Emily Hedeman, is an aye.

919
01:37:50,934 --> 01:37:51,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Attorney Desmond.

920
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:52,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to the applicant.

921
01:37:52,795 --> 01:37:57,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, and I appreciate the board's efforts in this matter and consideration, as well as staff.

922
01:37:58,680 --> 01:37:59,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

923
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:02,941
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate your patience around the public comment confusion.

924
01:38:03,501 --> 01:38:06,802
[SPEAKER_15]: But we took the conservative approach, which is hopefully the right one.

925
01:38:07,742 --> 01:38:08,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

926
01:38:09,042 --> 01:38:09,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

927
01:38:10,523 --> 01:38:11,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a nice evening.

928
01:38:15,504 --> 01:38:27,107
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, so the next item on our agenda is we're not discussing it tonight, but we did want to mention the Salem Street Corridor.

929
01:38:28,967 --> 01:38:40,332
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a Q&A meeting, question and answer meeting, next Monday the 10th at the Roberts Elementary School regarding the Salem Street Corridor proposed zoning amendment.

930
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:44,774
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're not going to be discussing this amendment.

931
01:38:44,814 --> 01:38:47,696
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not accepting public comment this evening.

932
01:38:48,276 --> 01:38:52,738
[SPEAKER_15]: We may at future meetings, but we just want to be really clear that

933
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:55,955
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to be discussing it.

934
01:38:55,995 --> 01:39:07,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there'll be some some really good info presented in that session next Monday and look forward to hearing more, but we're not going to be doing public comment tonight.

935
01:39:07,908 --> 01:39:09,610
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to be discussing Salem Street.

936
01:39:12,592 --> 01:39:25,083
[SPEAKER_15]: What I do need is a motion from a member of the board to continue the public hearing for the Salem Street Quarter Zoning Amendment to the March 5th CDB meeting.

937
01:39:28,926 --> 01:39:29,447
[SPEAKER_15]: So moved.

938
01:39:30,608 --> 01:39:31,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Ari.

939
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:32,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking for a second.

940
01:39:35,812 --> 01:39:36,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second that motion.

941
01:39:37,674 --> 01:39:38,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Annie.

942
01:39:38,255 --> 01:39:39,576
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

943
01:39:40,881 --> 01:39:41,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Ari Goffman-Fishman.

944
01:39:42,562 --> 01:39:42,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

945
01:39:43,883 --> 01:39:44,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Sabrina Alpino.

946
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:45,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

947
01:39:46,565 --> 01:39:47,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Adam Behrens.

948
01:39:50,909 --> 01:39:51,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

949
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:53,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Annie Strang.

950
01:39:53,831 --> 01:39:56,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Madam Chair, Adam is not eligible to vote on this.

951
01:39:57,714 --> 01:40:01,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, because you didn't watch it yet, right?

952
01:40:01,617 --> 01:40:03,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not watch that part of the tape.

953
01:40:03,419 --> 01:40:03,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

954
01:40:04,179 --> 01:40:08,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I only watched the two hours instead of the five.

955
01:40:10,018 --> 01:40:11,339
[SPEAKER_15]: That's this weekend's viewing, right?

956
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:13,220
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I appreciate the reminder.

957
01:40:14,701 --> 01:40:17,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we need to restart the roll call vote or can we keep going?

958
01:40:19,544 --> 01:40:20,444
[SPEAKER_05]: We were up to me.

959
01:40:20,865 --> 01:40:21,485
[SPEAKER_15]: We're up to you.

960
01:40:21,745 --> 01:40:22,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

961
01:40:22,225 --> 01:40:22,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

962
01:40:22,866 --> 01:40:22,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

963
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:24,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Annie Strang?

964
01:40:24,847 --> 01:40:25,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

965
01:40:26,468 --> 01:40:27,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Annie.

966
01:40:27,128 --> 01:40:27,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Ben LaValle?

967
01:40:27,809 --> 01:40:29,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

968
01:40:30,010 --> 01:40:32,171
[SPEAKER_15]: And myself, Emily Hedeman, is an aye.

969
01:40:33,342 --> 01:40:36,564
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, that item is continued to March 5th.

970
01:40:37,004 --> 01:40:41,707
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the meantime, there will be a meeting on February 10th at the Roberts Elementary School.

971
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:49,972
[SPEAKER_15]: The next item that we will be discussing is the green score.

972
01:40:49,992 --> 01:40:56,796
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to check with staff, see if they have any introductory comments.

973
01:40:57,257 --> 01:41:00,479
[SPEAKER_15]: I see we have Paola and Emily here again from Innocent Associates.

974
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:01,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, ladies.

975
01:41:03,798 --> 01:41:07,423
[SPEAKER_15]: But staff, do you have any introductory comments before we pass it off to Emily and team?

976
01:41:07,443 --> 01:41:13,751
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, seeing none.

977
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:24,218
[SPEAKER_15]: And just to clarify, we're going to be accepting public comments related to the green score.

978
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:30,584
[SPEAKER_15]: If you do have public comments about Salem Street, I would encourage you to email those to the board.

979
01:41:31,344 --> 01:41:35,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Also bring your questions to the session next Monday, and we will

980
01:41:37,596 --> 01:41:41,178
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, have more opportunity on the March 5th meeting.

981
01:41:41,719 --> 01:41:45,861
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll try to keep comments focused on the green score.

982
01:41:46,401 --> 01:41:51,985
[SPEAKER_15]: But Emily and Paola, if you have anything to share, we'd love to walk through the green score with you.

983
01:41:53,466 --> 01:41:53,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

984
01:41:53,886 --> 01:41:54,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.

985
01:41:54,887 --> 01:42:00,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Emily Ennis from Ennis Associates, and I'm with Paola Ramos-Martinez, also from Ennis Associates.

986
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:03,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn this presentation over to Paola.

987
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:10,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Chair, if I may.

988
01:42:13,304 --> 01:42:18,589
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that it's late, so I want to make sure that we have a little bit of time.

989
01:42:21,132 --> 01:42:26,256
[SPEAKER_08]: How much time do you think that I can take to present this topic?

990
01:42:27,557 --> 01:42:29,079
[SPEAKER_15]: What is your max and min?

991
01:42:31,127 --> 01:42:33,508
[SPEAKER_08]: So it depends on what you tell me.

992
01:42:33,608 --> 01:42:39,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I can shorten it or take a bit more time.

993
01:42:40,593 --> 01:42:42,854
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm going to try is to make it as simple as possible.

994
01:42:43,554 --> 01:42:54,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Some things are kind of technical, but if you have questions and want to go more deep into something very specific, I can obviously talk about that later.

995
01:42:56,422 --> 01:42:58,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Ideally, how much time would you have?

996
01:42:59,443 --> 01:43:01,724
[SPEAKER_08]: At least for the presentation, 15-20 minutes.

997
01:43:02,005 --> 01:43:02,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that okay?

998
01:43:03,025 --> 01:43:03,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think that's fine.

999
01:43:06,087 --> 01:43:10,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, then I'm going to start with the presentation.

1000
01:43:10,389 --> 01:43:11,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I will share my screen.

1001
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:15,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, quick poll for the board.

1002
01:43:15,072 --> 01:43:17,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Does anybody need a life break?

1003
01:43:19,314 --> 01:43:19,454
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

1004
01:43:19,654 --> 01:43:20,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, good.

1005
01:43:21,055 --> 01:43:21,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go.

1006
01:43:42,235 --> 01:43:51,658
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to take a little bit of time on the introduction and the timeline that we have done with this topic specific.

1007
01:43:52,778 --> 01:43:59,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Then to explain your current zoning and the existing conditions that we have in Medford, and that is from some analysis that we have done.

1008
01:44:01,186 --> 01:44:07,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And then to talk a little bit about pervious or permeable surface, what it is and how it is important.

1009
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:08,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the green score.

1010
01:44:09,032 --> 01:44:12,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we are here about the green score.

1011
01:44:13,375 --> 01:44:16,937
[SPEAKER_08]: But I need to build it up a little bit so that we can understand it.

1012
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:20,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try to do my best.

1013
01:44:21,812 --> 01:44:33,218
[SPEAKER_08]: So in this timeline, we have worked in July 24th, we presented in the City Council workshop where we had a lot of analysis and citywide in Medford.

1014
01:44:34,579 --> 01:44:39,442
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of them were about impermeable surface, permeable surface.

1015
01:44:39,822 --> 01:44:43,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to take just a second to define that permeable surface.

1016
01:44:44,848 --> 01:44:51,951
[SPEAKER_08]: is a surface that permits water to infiltrate to lower parts of, to lower layers of the soil.

1017
01:44:51,971 --> 01:45:01,214
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's important for rainwater management and flooding control and heat management as well.

1018
01:45:02,374 --> 01:45:10,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to give that definition so that we are, okay, they're telling me that I'm breaking up again.

1019
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:10,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sorry.

1020
01:45:12,317 --> 01:45:13,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1021
01:45:14,314 --> 01:45:18,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me turn off my video.

1022
01:45:19,157 --> 01:45:21,478
[SPEAKER_15]: And you may want to just share the window.

1023
01:45:23,979 --> 01:45:25,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm going to do that.

1024
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:26,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1025
01:45:27,361 --> 01:45:28,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it's better now.

1026
01:45:28,462 --> 01:45:34,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually don't have any problem with this, so I don't know why.

1027
01:45:34,545 --> 01:45:37,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I remember we had problems last time.

1028
01:45:37,767 --> 01:45:38,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry for that.

1029
01:45:42,944 --> 01:45:51,987
[SPEAKER_08]: What I wanted to say is that permeable surface is those surface that let water infiltrate to lower layers of the soil.

1030
01:45:52,007 --> 01:45:56,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is going to be important for flood management and heat control.

1031
01:45:57,669 --> 01:46:04,731
[SPEAKER_08]: So in this workshop, we make some analysis about the impermeable surface that are in Medford.

1032
01:46:05,351 --> 01:46:11,493
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had some issues about finding in your zoning something that will control

1033
01:46:12,389 --> 01:46:12,809
[SPEAKER_08]: that issue.

1034
01:46:12,829 --> 01:46:14,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And currently, you don't have that.

1035
01:46:15,231 --> 01:46:18,692
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's when Green Score came into place.

1036
01:46:19,253 --> 01:46:32,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So we presented some analysis in other areas of the United States, but also Massachusetts, so other cities that use Green Score as Cambridge, Somerville, Washington, DC, and others.

1037
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:35,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And from that, we presented in September 11.

1038
01:46:37,162 --> 01:46:37,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we did

1039
01:46:39,354 --> 01:46:50,380
[SPEAKER_08]: We personalized obviously the green score for Medford and we presented the draft to the City Council on October 9th and it was approved and referred to the City Board and that is why we are here today.

1040
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:56,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we here?

1041
01:46:57,062 --> 01:47:00,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is something that we are going to repeat a lot.

1042
01:47:00,303 --> 01:47:04,045
[SPEAKER_08]: We come here to our work right now.

1043
01:47:05,226 --> 01:47:06,667
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not only about this topic.

1044
01:47:06,707 --> 01:47:09,969
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at citywide Medford strategies.

1045
01:47:10,929 --> 01:47:12,450
[SPEAKER_08]: We are implementing all the

1046
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:30,809
[SPEAKER_08]: visions and strategies that were identified in the comprehensive plan that was published in 2023 and that took into consideration also other plans that have been done in METFOR as the house production plan and the climate action and adaptation plan.

1047
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:41,460
[SPEAKER_08]: So here I display some of these strategies that were in the comprehensive plan and that we are identifying and bringing in your zoning.

1048
01:47:41,801 --> 01:47:47,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are updating it to reflect what was identified in the comprehensive plan.

1049
01:47:48,815 --> 01:48:09,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to name very quickly, so that what we are talking about is this performance and standards for heat mitigation, stormwater infiltration and soil health, improve the tree canopy ratio, reduce heat island temperatures, reduce stormwater runoff citywide, expand ecological function, et cetera.

1050
01:48:09,532 --> 01:48:15,677
[SPEAKER_08]: So Green Score, what it's going to do is help us strengthen other strategies

1051
01:48:16,377 --> 01:48:19,283
[SPEAKER_08]: and will also address these issues directly.

1052
01:48:22,755 --> 01:48:32,058
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the requirements that you have right now in your current zoning about heat mitigation, stormwater infiltration, and soil health?

1053
01:48:32,298 --> 01:48:33,498
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't really have them.

1054
01:48:33,558 --> 01:48:39,120
[SPEAKER_08]: You do have open space and you have two types, landscape and usable.

1055
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:50,183
[SPEAKER_08]: These are some requirements that you have, but in your open space landscape, you also include walks and terraces, meaning without specifying that these need to be permeable.

1056
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:57,653
[SPEAKER_08]: and so in reality you do not have any requirement for a minimum of permeable or pervious surface.

1057
01:49:01,182 --> 01:49:09,810
[SPEAKER_08]: In this analysis that we did, I just wanted to show the FEMA and this is the flood hazard layers that are applied in Medford.

1058
01:49:10,451 --> 01:49:21,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And you don't have the high flood risk, but you do have the lower one in the areas of Mystic Avenue and Wellington, all this orange that

1059
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:31,215
[SPEAKER_08]: When we look at the impermeable surface analysis, we see that also these are the higher areas with impervious surface from 80 to 100%.

1060
01:49:33,076 --> 01:49:38,559
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we take into account also climate change and the new projections, this wouldn't help.

1061
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:47,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is why we will need to have something to address these issues so it doesn't get worse.

1062
01:49:49,296 --> 01:49:50,998
[SPEAKER_08]: So what are the options that we would have?

1063
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:59,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Option one, minimum pervious surface, as we were talking about, surface that allow water infiltrate, and then a minimum open space landscape.

1064
01:49:59,348 --> 01:50:00,450
[SPEAKER_08]: That is one option.

1065
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:03,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And option two would be the green score.

1066
01:50:04,274 --> 01:50:08,119
[SPEAKER_08]: We are recommending to use both, but depending on which case.

1067
01:50:09,289 --> 01:50:30,834
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if we look, I'm just going to go over, if we look into these two cases, when we have a requirement where the lot coverage, so the built area with impermeable surface, is very low, is very minimum, like 30, 40 and 50 percent, we do have a lot of a place on the ground floor.

1068
01:50:31,354 --> 01:50:44,056
[SPEAKER_08]: to really have a minimum permeable surface so it's very easy to reach that and so only with that minimum permeable and with a minimum landscape so we do also increase the green that would be more than enough.

1069
01:50:44,836 --> 01:50:58,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Now there are limitations when we are in case B where we do have a lot coverage that is quite high and we need to balance between having more housing stock or having more environmental

1070
01:51:01,431 --> 01:51:01,931
[SPEAKER_08]: standards.

1071
01:51:02,572 --> 01:51:10,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And so in case A we can use as we said, but in case B that's where we find Green Score to be very helpful.

1072
01:51:12,113 --> 01:51:21,819
[SPEAKER_08]: And how that does happen, I'm going to just pass that, is that the green score, what it does is going to provide a menu of different landscape elements.

1073
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:24,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't have to do them all.

1074
01:51:24,521 --> 01:51:26,603
[SPEAKER_08]: They can choose any of this.

1075
01:51:27,523 --> 01:51:31,526
[SPEAKER_08]: And depending on the development,

1076
01:51:32,386 --> 01:51:34,808
[SPEAKER_08]: that they have and the requirements that they need.

1077
01:51:35,428 --> 01:51:43,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we provide that flexibility or is intended to provide that flexibility, having all these different categories from where you can choose from.

1078
01:51:43,772 --> 01:51:48,695
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not about having a ground in ground level permeable surface.

1079
01:51:48,715 --> 01:51:55,559
[SPEAKER_08]: So letting half of the property to be permeable, but that you can really have all this

1080
01:51:56,039 --> 01:52:06,823
[SPEAKER_08]: things like bioretention or green roofs or ground covers in trees, so you get credits for all of these different elements.

1081
01:52:08,723 --> 01:52:20,908
[SPEAKER_08]: The very important thing here is that every of these landscape elements, depending on their performance, they have a different value, a different what we call the multiplier.

1082
01:52:21,888 --> 01:52:36,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if we have, for example, 01 is for plants that are ground covers like grasses, it doesn't do a lot for the ecosystem and ecologically it doesn't have a high standard.

1083
01:52:37,414 --> 01:52:47,064
[SPEAKER_08]: But large trees, they help a lot more creating shade, absorbing a lot more water, carbon, etc.

1084
01:52:47,124 --> 01:52:53,310
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we have a more complex ecosystem, that's where we get a higher value.

1085
01:52:54,752 --> 01:52:58,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing that is very interesting is that we can layer a lot of them.

1086
01:52:59,114 --> 01:53:09,018
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the same area, we can have the soil that is more than 24 inches, then ground covers, and then any shrub or trees.

1087
01:53:09,099 --> 01:53:16,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And you get elements and credits for all of these things, for the soil, for the ground cover, and for every shrub and trees.

1088
01:53:18,373 --> 01:53:28,818
[SPEAKER_08]: In how you calculate it, I'm just going to continue and just say that we did a worksheet to make it as easy as possible.

1089
01:53:29,878 --> 01:53:43,144
[SPEAKER_08]: So what you have to do is just place your lot size and then all the elements, only the ones that you have, place the area or the number of trees or shrubs and you will get calculated a green score.

1090
01:53:44,324 --> 01:53:53,208
[SPEAKER_08]: The green score is different depending on each district and it also goes from 0 to 100 and usually is around 20-25 the minimum requirement.

1091
01:54:00,386 --> 01:54:12,694
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we have is in case one that we talked about with only pervious surface, we would need the surface and it doesn't really do a lot for the environment because it's, I mean, sorry, it does.

1092
01:54:12,894 --> 01:54:22,600
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a permeable surface, so it helps, but it's not as helpful as having also trees and other layering that landscape.

1093
01:54:24,228 --> 01:54:31,156
[SPEAKER_08]: The applicability, it would be only for new principal buildings and there are two things that we need to take into account.

1094
01:54:31,476 --> 01:54:38,543
[SPEAKER_08]: If it is located in a FEMA area, as we see before, this orange area, then it has to go through Green Score.

1095
01:54:39,584 --> 01:54:45,950
[SPEAKER_08]: if it goes through, is a project that has to go through site plan review, it has to go through green score.

1096
01:54:46,370 --> 01:55:00,062
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not in any of these two, then it doesn't have to go through green score and what we recommend is just to have in this minimal permeable surface and the minimum open space landscape.

1097
01:55:01,142 --> 01:55:13,285
[SPEAKER_08]: So just I wanted to show a little bit of examples of what a 25 green score would look like with different of these elements and when we start layering them up.

1098
01:55:13,805 --> 01:55:17,106
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if we only use permeable paving, how much do I need?

1099
01:55:17,586 --> 01:55:21,247
[SPEAKER_08]: If I already have soil and ground cover, we reduce that surface.

1100
01:55:21,807 --> 01:55:28,650
[SPEAKER_08]: If we have trees and the soil and the ground cover and the permeable, we reduce also that surface.

1101
01:55:29,190 --> 01:55:34,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we can also do it with only having a green roof, if the other areas are needed.

1102
01:55:35,873 --> 01:55:50,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And then here is just to show the difference between just adding the permeable paving and giving more points as the ecological value of the landscape improves.

1103
01:55:51,419 --> 01:55:54,401
[SPEAKER_08]: So from 8 to 25 and you see the difference.

1104
01:55:56,943 --> 01:55:58,564
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the green score.

1105
01:55:59,865 --> 01:56:04,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to show as well the draft.

1106
01:56:04,829 --> 01:56:06,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go very quickly.

1107
01:56:07,051 --> 01:56:12,355
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the purpose, the overview, the applicability that we explained.

1108
01:56:13,535 --> 01:56:19,178
[SPEAKER_08]: all the zone districts, so it's different to each of these districts because we are reviewing the districts as well.

1109
01:56:19,198 --> 01:56:26,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time that we add a new one, we will amend the green score.

1110
01:56:27,881 --> 01:56:31,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to point out this part.

1111
01:56:32,663 --> 01:56:38,525
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked to someone from Cambridge, which was part of the green score in Cambridge,

1112
01:56:38,965 --> 01:56:48,773
[SPEAKER_08]: and told us that sometimes it's more difficult with affordable housing, so that's why we did this to reduce the minimum required.

1113
01:56:50,074 --> 01:57:01,344
[SPEAKER_08]: We will have a recommendation on this to clarify this a little bit more, but I just wanted to mention so that when I mention it later you will understand where I come from.

1114
01:57:02,245 --> 01:57:03,966
[SPEAKER_08]: We explained the calculations,

1115
01:57:06,582 --> 01:57:11,983
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some general standards for the trees, the soil maintenance and all these kind of things.

1116
01:57:12,403 --> 01:57:17,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the standards for landscape element is standards for each one of these landscape elements.

1117
01:57:19,245 --> 01:57:22,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we have some modifications for the site plan review.

1118
01:57:23,626 --> 01:57:35,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Some amendments so that they also will need to add to the site plan review the green score requirement with all the paperwork.

1119
01:57:35,814 --> 01:57:38,016
[SPEAKER_08]: and then other modifications.

1120
01:57:38,716 --> 01:57:46,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to pause it here so that you can ask any questions for now.

1121
01:57:46,642 --> 01:57:47,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a good moment.

1122
01:57:53,247 --> 01:57:53,567
[SPEAKER_15]: 16 minutes.

1123
01:57:55,769 --> 01:57:56,670
[SPEAKER_15]: That was very helpful.

1124
01:57:57,410 --> 01:58:01,213
[SPEAKER_15]: My initial question was, are there any communities doing this?

1125
01:58:01,273 --> 01:58:02,214
[SPEAKER_15]: And you mentioned Cambridge.

1126
01:58:04,684 --> 01:58:12,280
[SPEAKER_15]: has been the reception to this in Cambridge, like how is it working for them, and realizing that Medford is not Cambridge.

1127
01:58:13,477 --> 01:58:14,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.

1128
01:58:14,857 --> 01:58:18,718
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it has been a good reception overall.

1129
01:58:19,739 --> 01:58:24,960
[SPEAKER_08]: They find it a bit more difficult for residential, for single family, etc.

1130
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:32,402
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why we also decided not to really include them and only go to projects that are in the site plan review.

1131
01:58:33,442 --> 01:58:39,384
[SPEAKER_08]: One, because we don't think that it's actually very needed because the lot area usually is very

1132
01:58:40,622 --> 01:58:45,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot is built, so only we want those requirements to make it as easier.

1133
01:58:46,305 --> 01:58:52,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the rest, the affordable issue that was flagged from Cambridge, but that was it.

1134
01:58:52,448 --> 01:58:54,229
[SPEAKER_08]: The reception has been quite good.

1135
01:58:57,631 --> 01:58:57,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1136
01:58:59,832 --> 01:59:01,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Does the board have any other questions?

1137
01:59:10,518 --> 01:59:11,218
[SPEAKER_15]: I like this idea.

1138
01:59:11,238 --> 01:59:16,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's helpful, giving the flexibility.

1139
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:22,082
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that we've looked at menus in other topics.

1140
01:59:22,562 --> 01:59:27,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the ranking, the weighting of these menu items.

1141
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:29,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Adam?

1142
01:59:35,178 --> 01:59:41,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one thing just out of my own personal curiosity with kind of green upzoning places.

1143
01:59:41,401 --> 01:59:55,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in Cambridge, they experimented with curb cuts in areas that were prone to flooding so that water runoff could then go into kind of planted areas.

1144
01:59:57,426 --> 02:00:01,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was a cool idea when I kind of heard about it and I read about it.

1145
02:00:02,870 --> 02:00:25,645
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if there's any like public comments on what can be included and not included in the green zoning, but it'd be cool if something like that could be included or if there was learnings from Cambridge that would be, you know, sort of like easy things that could also help people get their score up that the city would also kind of participate with.

1146
02:00:27,428 --> 02:00:30,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So I haven't seen that in the Cambridge green score.

1147
02:00:31,572 --> 02:00:34,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you mean like the water to go through the surface?

1148
02:00:37,397 --> 02:00:43,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think that maybe that is more in public space more than in the private areas.

1149
02:00:43,766 --> 02:00:48,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe it was in the Cambridgeport area.

1150
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:58,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was maybe like a pilot that the city had done around curb cuts with the city-owned piece of that land where they plant the trees.

1151
02:00:58,957 --> 02:01:06,683
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead of just planting the tree with the sidewalk cut out, they made sort of like a little bit larger grass area within a curb cut.

1152
02:01:07,563 --> 02:01:09,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And those areas were prone to flooding.

1153
02:01:10,452 --> 02:01:12,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not necessarily a recommendation.

1154
02:01:12,873 --> 02:01:14,294
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily an ask.

1155
02:01:14,334 --> 02:01:20,736
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just thought that was a cool way that I know some other areas are trying to address the issue.

1156
02:01:20,756 --> 02:01:23,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's definitely an innovative approach.

1157
02:01:24,238 --> 02:01:30,621
[SPEAKER_15]: But just to clarify, the green score is for private development, right?

1158
02:01:30,901 --> 02:01:31,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1159
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:32,181
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1160
02:01:33,282 --> 02:01:33,602
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1161
02:01:35,142 --> 02:01:36,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia, I see your hand.

1162
02:01:37,226 --> 02:01:48,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam chair I just sort of wanted to clarify, I think if I am trying to understand what you're saying you mean like there's a green area, and there's a cut out of the curb so the water from the street flows into that green area.

1163
02:01:49,812 --> 02:01:51,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

1164
02:01:51,893 --> 02:01:54,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of some standard green infrastructure.

1165
02:01:54,554 --> 02:01:59,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you were to do a bioswale or something, that's one way that you would water it.

1166
02:01:59,536 --> 02:02:03,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also sometimes use that for tree plantings.

1167
02:02:03,678 --> 02:02:12,222
[SPEAKER_03]: So in theory, you wouldn't actually suggest something to that level of detail in the green score.

1168
02:02:12,402 --> 02:02:17,084
[SPEAKER_03]: You would say, you should have a bioswale that is properly designed by an engineer.

1169
02:02:18,084 --> 02:02:31,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may be so like say a big parking lot that like Herb Chambers might include something like what you're describing as part of their bioswale or their tree pit as a green way of doing it.

1170
02:02:33,356 --> 02:02:37,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you're aware, that's sort of like a smaller scale than this.

1171
02:02:37,439 --> 02:02:38,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.

1172
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:39,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1173
02:02:40,921 --> 02:02:41,442
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it though.

1174
02:02:42,483 --> 02:02:42,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Ari?

1175
02:02:43,865 --> 02:02:57,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I didn't see in the draft, is there any commentary on a ban on designated invasive plants in new plantings and or a strong preference for natives?

1176
02:02:57,328 --> 02:03:03,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Because both of those do have substantial impacts on flood water management.

1177
02:03:04,569 --> 02:03:08,350
[SPEAKER_12]: And we certainly don't need to repeat, for example, the calorie pairs.

1178
02:03:10,842 --> 02:03:17,684
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, in the standards, in the general standards, we don't let invasive species to be planted.

1179
02:03:18,325 --> 02:03:26,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also address the, we give bonus if the plants are native or adaptive species, non-invasive.

1180
02:03:28,428 --> 02:03:28,868
[SPEAKER_15]: That works.

1181
02:03:29,048 --> 02:03:29,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1182
02:03:30,489 --> 02:03:30,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Good question.

1183
02:03:36,370 --> 02:03:38,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other questions from the board?

1184
02:03:38,751 --> 02:03:41,972
[SPEAKER_15]: If not, I'm going to open the public comment period.

1185
02:03:43,832 --> 02:03:45,913
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm starting to see some hands, which is great.

1186
02:03:48,514 --> 02:03:54,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand function or message Danielle in the chat if you're having technical difficulties.

1187
02:03:55,076 --> 02:03:58,937
[SPEAKER_15]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

1188
02:03:59,638 --> 02:04:03,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

1189
02:04:03,859 --> 02:04:12,627
[SPEAKER_15]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members, as that's not part of the public record.

1190
02:04:13,047 --> 02:04:18,292
[SPEAKER_15]: However, if you are having audio or other technical difficulties, message staff for assistance.

1191
02:04:18,552 --> 02:04:19,913
[SPEAKER_15]: That's Alicia and Danielle.

1192
02:04:20,714 --> 02:04:22,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Each participant has two minutes to speak.

1193
02:04:25,138 --> 02:04:28,701
[SPEAKER_15]: And as a reminder, these comments should be focused on the green score.

1194
02:04:31,763 --> 02:04:39,898
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, I'm going to open up public comment and I see Zachary's hand raised.

1195
02:04:41,281 --> 02:04:44,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Zachary, please state your name and address for the record.

1196
02:04:45,269 --> 02:04:47,571
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Zachary Chertok at 5 Allmont Street.

1197
02:04:49,312 --> 02:04:52,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Emily, and the presentation was good.

1198
02:04:53,075 --> 02:04:55,437
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally like green score approaches.

1199
02:04:56,778 --> 02:05:03,283
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question I have is, are there green score thresholds that are going to be in place for approval for building designs?

1200
02:05:04,084 --> 02:05:06,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize if that was spoken to and I missed it.

1201
02:05:07,867 --> 02:05:09,028
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start with that one.

1202
02:05:09,878 --> 02:05:11,961
[SPEAKER_15]: So just keep asking your questions and we're going to address them at the end.

1203
02:05:12,001 --> 02:05:17,048
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question, and if this does bleed into the zoning, no problem, call it out, table it.

1204
02:05:19,671 --> 02:05:28,537
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the green score going to overlay into elements like the IZ setback schedules from before?

1205
02:05:28,617 --> 02:05:29,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to discuss the schedules.

1206
02:05:30,098 --> 02:05:36,362
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want a little insight into how they're going to cross over and consider those and factor in together.

1207
02:05:37,663 --> 02:05:41,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And will we be presented on that overlay at some point?

1208
02:05:46,329 --> 02:05:47,309
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm done.

1209
02:05:47,369 --> 02:05:48,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two questions.

1210
02:05:49,676 --> 02:05:51,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you, those are great questions.

1211
02:05:53,018 --> 02:05:57,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other members of the public with comments or questions?

1212
02:05:57,640 --> 02:06:02,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia or Danielle, are there any emails that have come through?

1213
02:06:02,923 --> 02:06:06,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Any hands with any technical difficulties?

1214
02:06:06,785 --> 02:06:09,927
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1215
02:06:10,247 --> 02:06:14,870
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no emails and I have not gotten any messages about anybody having trouble.

1216
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:21,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll say that I would refer the questions to our consultants rather than to me first.

1217
02:06:21,858 --> 02:06:22,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, for sure.

1218
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:28,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Emily and Paola, would you like to address Mr. Chertoff's questions?

1219
02:06:29,473 --> 02:06:34,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'd be happy to address them from the sort of the higher level zoning perspective.

1220
02:06:35,096 --> 02:06:39,419
[SPEAKER_02]: So the green score is applicable to development projects.

1221
02:06:39,499 --> 02:06:50,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody comes in with a new development project, it meets the criteria for the green score, it's site plan review, then the entire project is subject to that.

1222
02:06:50,866 --> 02:06:52,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the diagrams that Paola showed,

1223
02:06:53,407 --> 02:07:12,663
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see some of those strategies are applicable to the site at the ground plane, and others of those strategies are applicable to the building itself, such as, for example, the green or the blue roofs, which would be either the highest level of the roof, or if it's something that has a sort of terrace structure, it could be on multiple levels.

1224
02:07:13,864 --> 02:07:20,090
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the inclusionary zoning, I think it's what you are, sorry, incentive zoning rather,

1225
02:07:20,870 --> 02:07:24,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's what you were referring to for the overlay.

1226
02:07:24,653 --> 02:07:32,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the incentive zoning is being applied as we move through looking at the zoning for the entire city.

1227
02:07:32,839 --> 02:07:37,922
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking at whether or not it is appropriate for different areas.

1228
02:07:37,942 --> 02:07:39,063
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been applied.

1229
02:07:39,503 --> 02:07:41,725
[SPEAKER_02]: already to mystic Avenue.

1230
02:07:42,705 --> 02:07:57,915
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking at it for Salem Street, although I know we are not talking about that particular one but just to let people know that we're looking at it on a district by district, and the incentive zoning allows for an extra story or two depending on the district.

1231
02:07:59,056 --> 02:08:04,198
[SPEAKER_02]: of height if the development project can meet certain public benefits.

1232
02:08:04,679 --> 02:08:15,305
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those public benefits is that buildings are certifiable as LEED Platinum or other such green building scores.

1233
02:08:15,345 --> 02:08:17,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are many programs out there.

1234
02:08:17,066 --> 02:08:18,486
[SPEAKER_02]: There is Passive House.

1235
02:08:18,546 --> 02:08:20,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I think LEED is usually the most well-known.

1236
02:08:21,388 --> 02:08:23,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Passive House is gaining traction in Massachusetts.

1237
02:08:23,989 --> 02:08:24,970
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also Sites.

1238
02:08:25,550 --> 02:08:30,054
[SPEAKER_02]: which refers to, wait for it, the site plans, the landscape.

1239
02:08:30,814 --> 02:08:45,225
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea is that one of the potential public benefits, and again, this is a menu structure, could be a more energy efficient, more sustainable building itself, as well as a green score.

1240
02:08:45,285 --> 02:08:49,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see the two of those potentially working in tandem.

1241
02:08:49,648 --> 02:08:54,272
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an either or, the green score would be applicable for anything under site plan review.

1242
02:08:54,772 --> 02:08:59,516
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not the incentive zoning is taken advantage of.

1243
02:09:01,898 --> 02:09:06,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to clarify that, could they combine multiple forms of incentive zoning?

1244
02:09:09,073 --> 02:09:10,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent question.

1245
02:09:10,273 --> 02:09:14,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So the incentive zoning, it would depend on the district, the height limit.

1246
02:09:14,936 --> 02:09:29,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So, although there is a menu of choices for the incentive zoning, for example, if you are in a district that allows for 2 additional stories, you could only stack enough incentives up to get you to those 2 stories.

1247
02:09:30,503 --> 02:09:43,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the idea was to have a choice of options, um, because we know that over time, um, the finances change, the specific areas, uh, of, uh, what people are trying to accomplish change.

1248
02:09:44,408 --> 02:09:51,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we wanted to give maximum, um, flexibility to the city and to the developer to come to an agreement on something.

1249
02:09:51,691 --> 02:09:55,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why there's a menu, but there is a limitation based on the district.

1250
02:09:55,692 --> 02:09:57,613
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot just keep stacking them and going.

1251
02:09:57,633 --> 02:09:58,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1252
02:10:02,795 --> 02:10:04,176
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, we are still in.

1253
02:10:04,216 --> 02:10:10,281
[SPEAKER_12]: There was also a question about a particular threshold from the speaker.

1254
02:10:10,782 --> 02:10:11,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you speak to that?

1255
02:10:12,303 --> 02:10:12,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

1256
02:10:13,044 --> 02:10:13,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1257
02:10:13,724 --> 02:10:14,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't write.

1258
02:10:15,145 --> 02:10:18,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I was grabbing a pen and paper as he spoke, so I didn't write that one down.

1259
02:10:18,428 --> 02:10:19,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you remind me, please?

1260
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:24,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Zachary, I'm going to unmute you if you can remind us what that specific.

1261
02:10:27,015 --> 02:10:28,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1262
02:10:28,597 --> 02:10:31,139
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you need me to state my name and address again for the record?

1263
02:10:31,903 --> 02:10:33,925
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but I do appreciate your willingness to.

1264
02:10:35,486 --> 02:10:54,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as to whether or not, and this may be more for Alicia and Danielle, but if the city is going to establish a minimum scoring attainment through either model, whether it's through the score itself or through the land use model, if there will be minimum publishable standards that design has to achieve for approval.

1265
02:10:56,223 --> 02:10:56,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 25.

1266
02:10:58,964 --> 02:11:02,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sorry, through you, Madam Chair, 25 points.

1267
02:11:02,307 --> 02:11:04,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Paula, you can correct me if I got that wrong.

1268
02:11:05,430 --> 02:11:10,955
[SPEAKER_02]: But if affordable housing is part of the project, it would be 20 points.

1269
02:11:11,656 --> 02:11:15,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is what we're considering and still talking with city staff about now.

1270
02:11:15,059 --> 02:11:18,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll defer to you, Paula, for anything else.

1271
02:11:19,103 --> 02:11:23,547
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to flash the slide back up, that may be helpful just to remind us.

1272
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:26,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a good suggestion.

1273
02:11:26,823 --> 02:11:30,547
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if it was the slide or if it was the draft.

1274
02:11:33,739 --> 02:11:34,760
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be under draft.

1275
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:36,761
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it depends on the district.

1276
02:11:37,561 --> 02:11:39,042
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something I said.

1277
02:11:40,583 --> 02:11:48,068
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be from 20 to 25 commercial and it's less of the green score.

1278
02:11:48,088 --> 02:11:55,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, we will address per district how much we think should be the minimum.

1279
02:11:55,833 --> 02:11:57,814
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have here something that I didn't explain.

1280
02:11:57,854 --> 02:11:59,495
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a minimum and an ideal.

1281
02:12:00,052 --> 02:12:06,374
[SPEAKER_08]: this ideal of 30 is for that incentive zoning that we were talking about.

1282
02:12:06,414 --> 02:12:13,756
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a minimum that everyone that has to apply to the green score has to achieve and that can be 20 or 25.

1283
02:12:14,296 --> 02:12:17,357
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's affordable housing, then it can be reduced.

1284
02:12:18,357 --> 02:12:22,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we have a 20, we would like to have a recommendation and that changes just a tiny bit.

1285
02:12:23,278 --> 02:12:26,039
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, 20-25 and then the ideal would be 30.

1286
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:26,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1287
02:12:36,703 --> 02:12:38,746
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're still in public comment period.

1288
02:12:38,766 --> 02:12:43,071
[SPEAKER_15]: I do not see any hands raised.

1289
02:12:49,699 --> 02:12:52,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you to Zachary for your very thoughtful question.

1290
02:13:02,252 --> 02:13:08,234
[SPEAKER_15]: So seeing no additional public comments, I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting.

1291
02:13:14,996 --> 02:13:24,939
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know there was some discussion because when we initially did the public hearing, Salem Street and the green score were noticed together.

1292
02:13:29,860 --> 02:13:43,185
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there is a scenario where we can, if the board was ready, we could vote specifically on the green score and not on Salem Street.

1293
02:13:46,967 --> 02:13:47,687
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

1294
02:13:49,033 --> 02:13:52,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we can also require revisions.

1295
02:13:52,194 --> 02:13:55,075
[SPEAKER_15]: So just to clarify, that is another option.

1296
02:13:55,555 --> 02:13:56,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Danielle, I see your hand.

1297
02:13:57,495 --> 02:14:05,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to add that the Green Score Zoning Amendment and the Salem Street Court Amendment also have different paper numbers.

1298
02:14:06,518 --> 02:14:12,059
[SPEAKER_09]: At City Council, do we have the Green Score paper number handy?

1299
02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:16,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that is a way to differentiate between the two.

1300
02:14:16,041 --> 02:14:17,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I had that.

1301
02:14:20,261 --> 02:14:20,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be there.

1302
02:14:48,749 --> 02:14:49,211
[SPEAKER_13]: This is 122, not 115.

1303
02:15:33,338 --> 02:15:35,258
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I can find a paper number here.

1304
02:15:35,278 --> 02:15:41,439
[SPEAKER_15]: I just have the public hearing notice.

1305
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:43,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking for it.

1306
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:48,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually when we do the public hearing notice, it hasn't had a paper number created yet.

1307
02:15:49,961 --> 02:15:52,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I always wish that it was there so I could put it in the notice.

1308
02:15:54,642 --> 02:16:00,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go through the council agendas and see what it was, unless Alicia, I see your hand is raised.

1309
02:16:00,223 --> 02:16:01,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know it or did you find it yet?

1310
02:16:03,995 --> 02:16:12,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for it, but I actually just wanted to raise one make sure one other thing was clear before you kind of moved into any sort of.

1311
02:16:13,821 --> 02:16:15,422
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations and stuff.

1312
02:16:16,523 --> 02:16:22,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to be make sure it's very clear because we really have it in our head in this board that we're approving things.

1313
02:16:23,667 --> 02:16:27,189
[SPEAKER_03]: This is recommendations from the board of the city council.

1314
02:16:27,329 --> 02:16:28,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you're right.

1315
02:16:28,230 --> 02:16:31,692
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be in the form of some like list of recommendations.

1316
02:16:31,812 --> 02:16:37,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And just so you're everybody's clear one, the city council can choose to take them or not take them.

1317
02:16:37,935 --> 02:16:47,757
[SPEAKER_03]: and they have the opportunity to add additional, to change, like the last Mystic Ab, one of the counselors made a motion from the floor for a minor change.

1318
02:16:48,177 --> 02:16:51,478
[SPEAKER_03]: That is also something that could happen after you've passed it on.

1319
02:16:51,958 --> 02:16:55,839
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was dramatic, then it would have to be re-noticed and re-heard.

1320
02:16:57,079 --> 02:16:58,400
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really helpful clarification.

1321
02:16:58,620 --> 02:16:59,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Alicia.

1322
02:17:00,015 --> 02:17:10,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess actually I'll say that if this board did anything that was super dramatic, and like, oh, we're going to also do affordable housing as part of this, right?

1323
02:17:10,245 --> 02:17:10,626
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be.

1324
02:17:10,646 --> 02:17:11,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tempt me.

1325
02:17:12,167 --> 02:17:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have to actually be re-noticed.

1326
02:17:14,209 --> 02:17:17,853
[SPEAKER_03]: That would actually have to start the process over because it was too dramatic.

1327
02:17:17,913 --> 02:17:20,375
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a modification.

1328
02:17:21,156 --> 02:17:21,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1329
02:17:21,957 --> 02:17:22,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1330
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:25,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

1331
02:17:26,260 --> 02:17:39,488
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I have possibly a question for you, madam chair, or a question for director hunt, which is, we do have some recommendations for additional definitions that clarify the difference between green roof and blue roof.

1332
02:17:40,328 --> 02:17:47,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you need to ask to present them tonight so you can see them and include them in your recommendations or director hunt.

1333
02:17:47,450 --> 02:17:54,873
[SPEAKER_02]: If a city councilor could bring them forward to the meeting I know we had talked about this I'm not sure, given the week that we've all had.

1334
02:17:55,493 --> 02:18:07,157
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've had a chance to review them collectively and the staff on your side so, but I just wanted to bring it up while we had the opportunity we could certainly also ask if a city councilors willing to make that motion on the floor.

1335
02:18:08,017 --> 02:18:25,827
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did want to let the CD board know that there are three additional definitions, just again, to clarify the difference between a green roof, a blue roof, the combination of the two, and also the solar reflective index, also known as SRI, which basically means having a lighter color.

1336
02:18:26,467 --> 02:18:30,889
[SPEAKER_02]: on a flat roof to reflect the sun off that flat roof.

1337
02:18:31,349 --> 02:18:48,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not apply to pitch roof such as for single family or none of this because it doesn't require site plan review would apply to the lower levels of residential such as single unit, two unit, three unit.

1338
02:19:01,819 --> 02:19:08,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really just a notification that that could, oh, I see your hand up, Alicia, but it's a notification that that could happen in city council as well.

1339
02:19:08,584 --> 02:19:09,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Alicia.

1340
02:19:10,005 --> 02:19:28,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam chair, I think that it makes sense for Emily to share that information with the board because the intention of it is to clarify the information that's actually already in front of you, but to clarify it in a way that is documented so that future people reading the zoning have the same understanding.

1341
02:19:29,143 --> 02:19:43,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and this information was shared with the board in our packet, but I think if you do have, if you can walk through it for the board, I think that would be helpful, as well as any members of the public that are still tuning in.

1342
02:19:46,810 --> 02:19:48,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Ella, do you want to bring up the definitions?

1343
02:19:50,691 --> 02:19:50,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1344
02:19:51,251 --> 02:19:52,812
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably have them handier than I do.

1345
02:20:05,043 --> 02:20:08,245
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going by point by point.

1346
02:20:08,986 --> 02:20:16,711
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted to clarify the, as I said, these projects with affordable housing that may reduce the minimum required green score to 20.

1347
02:20:16,991 --> 02:20:24,556
[SPEAKER_08]: And the new paragraph would read as projects that provide more affordable units than the minimum required,

1348
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:32,139
[SPEAKER_08]: or provide affordable units with the affordability are subject to reduce the required green score by five points.

1349
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:42,224
[SPEAKER_08]: So, depending on the district, they could reduce five points if they provide more affordability and more than what is required.

1350
02:20:42,605 --> 02:20:49,328
[SPEAKER_08]: That, I think, was not clear in the first sentence.

1351
02:20:49,994 --> 02:20:50,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I like that.

1352
02:20:50,594 --> 02:20:54,517
[SPEAKER_15]: And then for some districts, the minimum required score is 20.

1353
02:20:54,757 --> 02:20:56,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

1354
02:20:56,618 --> 02:20:57,999
[SPEAKER_15]: So that makes sense.

1355
02:20:58,039 --> 02:20:59,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1356
02:21:00,161 --> 02:21:05,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the second, as Emily mentioned, we wanted to give a little bit more flexibility with the roofs.

1357
02:21:05,724 --> 02:21:09,547
[SPEAKER_08]: So, in the beginning, we had only green roofs, intensive and extensive.

1358
02:21:10,233 --> 02:21:12,454
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we added the blue roofs.

1359
02:21:13,354 --> 02:21:20,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we want to add as well the high SRI, as Emily said, the Solar Reflective Index.

1360
02:21:22,038 --> 02:21:30,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So we wanted to amend the table to include the high SRI and instead of green roofs, the category will be named roofs.

1361
02:21:31,342 --> 02:21:38,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And to have at least a minimum of 0.2, sorry, the value of the C4 element.

1362
02:21:39,406 --> 02:21:39,526
[SPEAKER_08]: is 0.2.

1363
02:21:43,750 --> 02:22:02,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Then with this as well we will clarify the definitions and so in the section 7 standards for landscape elements we would define what a green roof is, what a blue roof is and also to add certain standards

1364
02:22:03,564 --> 02:22:04,285
[SPEAKER_08]: to the blue roofs.

1365
02:22:04,305 --> 02:22:12,710
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to make sure that the people understand that blue roofs are high maintenance and so that you need to really take care of it.

1366
02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:19,413
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is an additional, so they have to study if it's economically feasible.

1367
02:22:19,754 --> 02:22:21,455
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to make sure that they really work.

1368
02:22:22,955 --> 02:22:39,731
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have the combination of green and blue and what we really want to say also then defining is that they have to follow all the green and riffs conditions and standards and that to calculate them you can sum both with the same area.

1369
02:22:40,071 --> 02:22:42,353
[SPEAKER_08]: You can sum the blue and the green since it is

1370
02:22:44,315 --> 02:23:02,979
[SPEAKER_08]: a high cost maintenance and also it is very good for the environment because it will storage water as well as improve the insulation of the building and many other ecosystem ecological performance.

1371
02:23:03,719 --> 02:23:10,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we define the high solar radiation index and when that would be reflective index.

1372
02:23:11,361 --> 02:23:30,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's solar reflective index, so that, yeah, the definition and some of the standards that need to be followed, so we at least have an SRI of 82 for roofs that are more than the slope to 12.

1373
02:23:32,012 --> 02:23:37,034
[SPEAKER_08]: So if it's too 12 horse deeper, then it shall not be subject to this SRI requirement.

1374
02:23:38,195 --> 02:23:39,636
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not eligible for credit.

1375
02:23:41,565 --> 02:23:42,966
[SPEAKER_15]: And 212 is rise over run?

1376
02:23:42,986 --> 02:23:45,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry?

1377
02:23:45,068 --> 02:23:46,950
[SPEAKER_15]: 212 is rise over run?

1378
02:23:46,970 --> 02:23:47,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1379
02:23:48,431 --> 02:23:48,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1380
02:23:50,833 --> 02:23:51,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember something from school.

1381
02:23:54,337 --> 02:23:54,577
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1382
02:23:54,777 --> 02:23:59,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So this would be the recommendations that we were discussing.

1383
02:23:59,561 --> 02:24:06,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be happy to go through any more in depth if you want.

1384
02:24:06,628 --> 02:24:08,009
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1385
02:24:10,287 --> 02:24:13,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions from the board on these recommendations?

1386
02:24:13,128 --> 02:24:14,108
[SPEAKER_15]: They all make sense to me.

1387
02:24:14,128 --> 02:24:14,988
[SPEAKER_15]: They seem logical.

1388
02:24:15,008 --> 02:24:39,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any other information related to this that needs to be presented?

1389
02:24:48,535 --> 02:24:50,137
[SPEAKER_02]: We have completed our presentation.

1390
02:24:50,157 --> 02:24:52,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to all the board members for your patience.

1391
02:24:59,204 --> 02:25:16,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, are there any further revisions we want to make to the recommendations?

1392
02:25:18,132 --> 02:25:19,953
[SPEAKER_15]: that will be shared with the city council.

1393
02:25:24,897 --> 02:25:26,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing comes to mind for me.

1394
02:25:26,178 --> 02:25:27,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it looks pretty good.

1395
02:25:27,899 --> 02:25:41,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think this is a really exciting way to look at increasing pervious services and open space in Medford that doesn't limit new development.

1396
02:25:53,726 --> 02:25:55,807
[SPEAKER_15]: So as a board, how are we feeling?

1397
02:25:56,227 --> 02:26:01,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we ready to make a recommendation on the green score?

1398
02:26:01,588 --> 02:26:02,928
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm seeing thumbs.

1399
02:26:06,309 --> 02:26:06,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1400
02:26:07,349 --> 02:26:07,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Danielle?

1401
02:26:07,749 --> 02:26:11,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I located the paper number.

1402
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:18,172
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 24-499, but I wanted to check and see what the Salem Street corridor

1403
02:26:19,518 --> 02:26:24,502
[SPEAKER_09]: paper number was just to confirm they were different and now I'm still hunting it down.

1404
02:26:24,842 --> 02:26:29,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia, do you remember when it was reported out and to be referred?

1405
02:26:29,866 --> 02:26:34,029
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to be different because they were reported out.

1406
02:26:34,069 --> 02:26:36,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can't find the date.

1407
02:26:36,191 --> 02:26:40,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it, sorry, it was December 11th.

1408
02:26:42,316 --> 02:26:44,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, that's the council permitting meeting, sorry.

1409
02:26:47,082 --> 02:26:52,106
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it was in the permitting meeting on the 11th, it must have been the meeting of the 17th.

1410
02:26:52,286 --> 02:26:53,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me go in there.

1411
02:26:53,287 --> 02:27:01,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, here it is.

1412
02:27:01,953 --> 02:27:05,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I am now, so it was the 17th.

1413
02:27:16,783 --> 02:27:22,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can, sorry, it's hard to read their agendas these days.

1414
02:27:24,027 --> 02:27:34,112
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess 24, there was a hearing that night for Mystic Avenue and that was 24-490.

1415
02:27:34,252 --> 02:27:34,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, is it November 13th?

1416
02:27:44,885 --> 02:27:51,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, agenda item 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with Innis Associates team.

1417
02:27:53,214 --> 02:27:58,940
[SPEAKER_15]: They went over the proposed green score zoning ordinance and then a short intro to Salem Street.

1418
02:28:11,882 --> 02:28:22,985
[SPEAKER_03]: 24-515 offered by Vice President Collins, proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance, Salem Street Corridor District for referral to the Community Development Board.

1419
02:28:24,765 --> 02:28:27,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So 24-515, that's the Salem Street number.

1420
02:28:27,866 --> 02:28:29,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1421
02:28:30,027 --> 02:28:31,967
[SPEAKER_09]: And 24-499 is Green's score.

1422
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:40,783
[SPEAKER_09]: So that separates them because they work two different papers.

1423
02:28:41,243 --> 02:28:41,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1424
02:28:41,944 --> 02:28:48,368
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just combined for discussion purposes and ready at the same time.

1425
02:28:49,688 --> 02:28:58,434
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I'm hearing from the board is that we're ready to vote on the green score, which is paper number 24-499.

1426
02:29:02,859 --> 02:29:10,801
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I'd be looking for is a motion to recommend approval of the draft zoning.

1427
02:29:10,821 --> 02:29:11,881
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm sorry.

1428
02:29:13,841 --> 02:29:14,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Strike that.

1429
02:29:14,421 --> 02:29:23,143
[SPEAKER_15]: I am looking for a motion to recommend approval of the green score as revised.

1430
02:29:24,724 --> 02:29:31,265
[SPEAKER_15]: So that includes the recommendations from Emily and Paola, the draft that we've seen today.

1431
02:29:34,533 --> 02:29:40,556
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you're not ready to vote tonight, then, you know, that's, that's okay.

1432
02:29:42,017 --> 02:29:42,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ari.

1433
02:29:42,557 --> 02:29:43,878
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be looking for a second.

1434
02:29:44,478 --> 02:29:45,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second that motion.

1435
02:29:46,420 --> 02:29:47,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Annie.

1436
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:49,821
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

1437
02:29:51,482 --> 02:29:58,846
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, this is just for the green score recommendation, um, item two four dash four nine nine.

1438
02:30:00,667 --> 02:30:01,548
[SPEAKER_15]: So roll call vote.

1439
02:30:04,273 --> 02:30:05,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Ari Goffman-Fishman?

1440
02:30:06,393 --> 02:30:06,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1441
02:30:07,874 --> 02:30:08,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1442
02:30:08,554 --> 02:30:09,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Sabrina Alpino?

1443
02:30:10,394 --> 02:30:10,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1444
02:30:12,275 --> 02:30:12,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Adam Behrens?

1445
02:30:13,995 --> 02:30:14,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1446
02:30:15,895 --> 02:30:16,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Annie Strang?

1447
02:30:17,296 --> 02:30:17,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1448
02:30:19,196 --> 02:30:19,876
[SPEAKER_15]: Ben LaValle?

1449
02:30:21,517 --> 02:30:21,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1450
02:30:23,197 --> 02:30:25,257
[SPEAKER_15]: And myself, Emily Hudiman, is an aye.

1451
02:30:27,358 --> 02:30:33,239
[SPEAKER_15]: So we pass the recommendation on to City Council for the green score.

1452
02:30:35,213 --> 02:30:36,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Very exciting work.

1453
02:30:36,253 --> 02:30:36,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Emily.

1454
02:30:36,893 --> 02:30:37,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Paula.

1455
02:30:37,553 --> 02:30:46,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate the work you've done along with the city staff to do this important work to help make Medford a more sustainable and climate ready city.

1456
02:30:49,916 --> 02:30:53,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much to the members of the board for passing this back to city council.

1457
02:30:53,797 --> 02:30:59,078
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to seeing you for the next round of zoning edits and potential changes.

1458
02:31:00,178 --> 02:31:00,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Likewise.

1459
02:31:03,141 --> 02:31:05,363
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're coming towards the end of our agenda.

1460
02:31:06,944 --> 02:31:13,828
[SPEAKER_15]: We have three sets of minutes that need to be approved.

1461
02:31:16,771 --> 02:31:25,817
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.

1462
02:31:29,459 --> 02:31:31,381
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have meeting minutes from

1463
02:31:33,562 --> 02:31:36,083
[SPEAKER_15]: November 20th, 2024, December 18th, 2024, and then January 22nd, 2025.

1464
02:31:36,163 --> 02:31:40,425
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the Salem Street public hearing part one.

1465
02:31:40,445 --> 02:31:45,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Does anybody have any feedback, revisions for those minutes?

1466
02:32:01,143 --> 02:32:07,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a point from earlier, if I missed the January one, do I abstain from that approval?

1467
02:32:08,925 --> 02:32:13,987
[SPEAKER_15]: So historically, that's what I have done, but I don't think you have to abstain.

1468
02:32:14,707 --> 02:32:26,090
[SPEAKER_12]: My understanding is that the vote is on the acceptance of the minutes that you are voting that they have been presented to you and we are putting them into the record.

1469
02:32:26,110 --> 02:32:28,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

1470
02:32:30,262 --> 02:32:31,623
[SPEAKER_12]: City staff, correct me if I'm wrong.

1471
02:32:32,584 --> 02:32:34,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's the direction that we got.

1472
02:32:34,105 --> 02:32:36,247
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was like, what's the point then?

1473
02:32:38,128 --> 02:32:40,590
[SPEAKER_09]: We really want the details, you watch the video.

1474
02:32:41,191 --> 02:32:44,373
[SPEAKER_09]: But yes, that is correct.

1475
02:32:44,393 --> 02:32:47,115
[SPEAKER_09]: You're voting to accept the minutes.

1476
02:32:48,848 --> 02:32:57,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can, one of the jobs of the clerk is also to kind of like give it the okay, and then the others can rely on it on that as well.

1477
02:32:57,750 --> 02:33:02,831
[SPEAKER_09]: So once we elect a clerk, someone can take that on that role.

1478
02:33:08,112 --> 02:33:14,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I make a motion to accept all three together barring any additional comments?

1479
02:33:17,394 --> 02:33:17,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1480
02:33:19,275 --> 02:33:20,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I have a second?

1481
02:33:25,258 --> 02:33:26,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second that motion.

1482
02:33:27,078 --> 02:33:27,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Annie.

1483
02:33:27,859 --> 02:33:31,721
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, we're going to do a roll call vote.

1484
02:33:39,264 --> 02:33:40,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Ari Goffman-Fishman?

1485
02:33:41,425 --> 02:33:41,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1486
02:33:43,066 --> 02:33:43,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Sabrina Alpino?

1487
02:33:45,186 --> 02:33:45,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1488
02:33:46,807 --> 02:33:47,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Adam Behrens?

1489
02:33:48,428 --> 02:33:48,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1490
02:33:50,098 --> 02:33:50,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Annie Strang.

1491
02:33:51,579 --> 02:33:51,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1492
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:53,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Ben Lavallee.

1493
02:33:53,541 --> 02:33:55,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1494
02:33:56,463 --> 02:34:02,527
[SPEAKER_15]: And myself, Emily Hedeman, is also an aye for the acceptance of the three sets of minutes for the aforementioned dates.

1495
02:34:05,209 --> 02:34:07,591
[SPEAKER_15]: The next item on the agenda is zoning updates.

1496
02:34:13,495 --> 02:34:15,697
[SPEAKER_15]: City staff, do you have any brief zoning updates?

1497
02:34:17,153 --> 02:34:17,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Five minutes or less.

1498
02:34:17,993 --> 02:34:22,175
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing sort of beyond Paula gave you the timeline.

1499
02:34:22,295 --> 02:34:26,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to repeat that there's going to be this meeting on Monday.

1500
02:34:26,336 --> 02:34:29,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try and send that to you all.

1501
02:34:29,598 --> 02:34:31,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And you are welcome to push that out to other people.

1502
02:34:33,279 --> 02:34:34,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be really helpful.

1503
02:34:35,180 --> 02:34:39,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know if that meeting, will notes be taken?

1504
02:34:39,741 --> 02:34:43,643
[SPEAKER_15]: I unfortunately have a conflict that evening, but I'm very interested.

1505
02:34:44,335 --> 02:34:49,726
[SPEAKER_03]: The plan is to have somebody record sort of all the Q&A.

1506
02:34:49,746 --> 02:34:49,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1507
02:34:51,544 --> 02:34:54,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess the other piece, there'll be a few different things we'll present.

1508
02:34:54,766 --> 02:34:57,107
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be boards that people can put things on.

1509
02:34:57,147 --> 02:35:00,548
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't want to talk, there'll be an opportunity for people to ask questions in a group.

1510
02:35:01,569 --> 02:35:13,014
[SPEAKER_03]: But also Councilor Kit Collins is working on reworking the zoning web page in a more graphically understanding, able to digest way.

1511
02:35:13,114 --> 02:35:19,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's putting together some digestible bits that we can put out as well that we'll share as well as soon as they're ready.

1512
02:35:20,738 --> 02:35:20,898
Great.

1513
02:35:23,893 --> 02:35:29,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to add that it's in person at the Roberts Elementary School and it starts at 6.30.

1514
02:35:29,676 --> 02:35:30,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1515
02:35:33,097 --> 02:35:33,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

1516
02:35:35,478 --> 02:35:41,421
[SPEAKER_15]: So if there's no other business in front of the board, we are looking for a motion to adjourn.

1517
02:35:46,883 --> 02:35:50,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I make a motion to adjourn the meeting for this evening.

1518
02:35:51,866 --> 02:35:52,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1519
02:35:53,192 --> 02:35:53,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1520
02:35:56,034 --> 02:35:57,815
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to do a roll call vote.

1521
02:35:58,495 --> 02:36:02,097
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do see a member of the public with their hand raised.

1522
02:36:02,857 --> 02:36:07,100
[SPEAKER_15]: We do not have any active public comment periods happening right now.

1523
02:36:07,240 --> 02:36:17,025
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd encourage you to email Medford or reach out to Alicia or Danielle with any comments or feedback.

1524
02:36:18,646 --> 02:36:20,547
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to do a roll call vote for adjournment.

1525
02:36:29,077 --> 02:36:30,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Ari Goffman-Fishman.

[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_15]: And myself, Emily Hedeman, is an aye for adjournment.

02:36:48,132 --> 02:36:49,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much, members of the board.

1537
02:36:49,314 --> 02:36:50,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, city staff.

1538
02:36:51,117 --> 02:36:52,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, public, for joining us.

1539
02:36:54,002 --> 02:36:57,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Our next meeting is, I believe, the 19th.
