00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:35,047
years now and this year in particular we've just had a lot of help so a few thank yous before I turn it over to this amazing band. First to the West Medford Community Center, historic space

3
00:00:35,350 --> 00:01:00,123
We were showing some of the performers around inside earlier, and there's a lot there. There's a lot of history, a lot of amazing artists who have come from this place. So in between sets, I really hope you'll go inside, take advantage of the Danish Pastry House, who has set up headquarters there. I've been eating a lot of it, and everything just keeps getting better. It's amazing. So also to the Arts Alive Foundation, Medford Foundation.

4
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:16,863
They've really helped us financial support Morningside Music Studio, the Medford Arts Council, Triangle Manor. We've got some beautiful t-shirts up there with two of our volunteers who are also involved in eating Danish pastry house.

5
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:42,985
Berkeley's Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice, which is where this band is from. I heard them playing a little earlier. It sounded incredible. Terry will tell you more about the history later, but it's a beautiful way of bringing that program full circle with where Terry Lynn Carrington, who's a legendary drummer from around here, really got her start, which was here. Her parents are still involved in this community.

6
00:01:43,205 --> 00:02:10,998
Thank you also to our Patreon members, who are folks just like you, put in a couple dollars a month. It helps us pay for things like jam sessions, for the actual festival itself. Over the years it's really added up in a meaningful way, so if you're looking to get involved, there are numerous QR codes that you can scan to find out more about that. To the people working the cameras, Medford Community Media, you three have gone above and beyond.

7
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:40,158
I was thinking at least one camera would be great, but now we have three. So it's great to get high quality video. This is also being live streamed for those who couldn't be here in person. Lastly, to the Winchester Community Music School, to EXP Realty, and to Staples for our wonderful programs here. And thank you, of course, to our volunteers and staff, to Shayla, my partner, who's done basically everything.

8
00:02:40,732 --> 00:03:10,280
To Reese and Eva up there, the tables. And to Bruce, who's been also stepping in and doing just about everything. And now I'll turn it over to Terry Carter, who manages many different things here at the Community Center. Also the former Poet Laureate of Medford, has written a lot of stuff. I know some of you saw him yesterday as part of our project, the Ally Project, but really couldn't do this without him. And he's gonna tell you

9
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:43,051
Love that, that's cool. So let me just take you through where we've been so far. So on Friday night, we started out with a student night, and it's very interesting because most of the students were of the older, more mature variety, and they're from Morningside Music School, and they put together two different bands, and they were fantastic, phenomenal,

10
00:03:43,490 --> 00:04:12,683
quite delightful, and then Anita Wood came, Anita came from Medford, not originally from Medford, but grew up a good portion of her childhood here, and she brought her band, it was called A.J. and the Groove, and they were similarly wonderful, so that was night one, and then yesterday afternoon, we started out with Brazilian Flavor, with Recita de Samba, featuring Anna Borges and Bill Ward, and they were smoking hot, so.

11
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:38,097
And then, as Jonathan said, the Ally Project, featuring myself and Jonathan, great Toro, and great drummer, Gordon Engelthal, we finished up. So today, we're into a new groove, and it's Berklee's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, under the leadership of Terry Lynn Carrington.

12
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:59,528
We have, from the Institute, we have Jan Portage on bass. And he's got the big sexy today, all right? So that's the biggest bass you're going to see this weekend. And we have Yujin Han on piano. My man in yellow here, Fall Ray on sax.

13
00:05:12,185 --> 00:05:34,645
She's a drummer, she's a composer, she's an educator from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and she's known for her powerful artistry and ability to blend diverse musical traditions. You'll see all this. She holds degrees from Dominican Republic Music Conservatory and Berklee College of Music, where she studied with well-known artists including Neil Smith,

14
00:05:34,645 --> 00:06:04,244
the aforementioned Terry Lynn Carrington, Francisco Mela, and others. She's a compelling live performer. You're gonna see all this. And she is leading up a band that really, really smokes. So I'm gonna get out the way and let them do what they do. Welcome to day three of the Medford Jazz Festival at the West Historic West Medford Community Center. Ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:11,669
Devon Equesta and the Berkley Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice. Let them do their thing.

Hey, guys. Thank you for having us. It's a pleasure for us to be here. This is an amazing place. It's my first time here, and maybe all of us, right? First time? Yeah. So thank you so much for the invitation. Like Terry said before, my name is Ivana Cuesta, and I'm part of the Gas and Gender Justice Institute, led by Theronine Carrington.

27
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:22,765
And the music that we want to read today, it's music composed by women, but also non-binary people. So we want to try to do is...

28
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:44,467
just bring something that sometimes is not well recognized, I would say, in the music industry. So that's why, yeah, we just choose really nice tunes. But also from some, actually from some of our professors. So the first tune that we play, it's called Chaos. It's one of my

29
00:14:44,888 --> 00:15:02,017
My tunes that I wrote, I think two years ago, and it's in my album, Alert to the Earth. So you maybe had the sense it was a little bit chaotic and really loud and really noisy, but that was how I actually felt.

30
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:19,702
the pandemic ends. So I think everyone probably wrote music as a song or something after the pandemic because it was really something that affected all of us. So the next tune that we're going to be playing is Kowtow by Caroline Davis. I hope you enjoy.

Thank you, thank you. Okay, so I just want to introduce really quick the band. Like Terry actually said before, so we have Eugene on piano. We have Jan, right? Yeah, it's a German name, I can't. But yeah, Jan on bass.

37
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:08,470

Great. So the tune that we just played right now, it's called Amelia, and it's by Melissa Galdana. So I probably choose a lot of tunes that are written by saxophone players. But all of them are amazing. I don't know. I just love it. So the next tune that we're going to play is a tune that I composed. It's called On Going Cycles.

51
00:36:56,967 --> 00:37:22,195
And I would say maybe when I was thinking, when I was composing this, I was just thinking like how everything come back to the same place or everything come back again to like harmony basically. So all of us are going to start in different points in music, but there is going to be one section where everyone is in unity.

52
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:48,031
This track is part of, like I said, also of my album, and it's related with the earth. And like how, you know, the seasons and all of that, and we come back again to the beginning. And sometimes we think like, oh, we're never going to have summer again after eight months of winter. That's how I feel, and I already have nine years living here. You know?

53
00:37:48,554 --> 00:38:12,179
everything come back in the right time, not sometimes when we want it, but when we need it. So this is ongoing cycle.

Ivana told me to say something. So this is it. Thanks. Thank you all for being here. My name is Paul. Thank you. This next song is mine. So I thought I would introduce it. There's a quick story to tell with it. So there's this piano player who teaches at Berkeley and lives in Boston. His name is Kevin Harris. Does anybody know Kevin?

66
00:46:57,768 --> 00:47:23,722
Kevin's amazing, he's been an amazing friend and mentor to me. And I had him over at my house a couple weeks ago, and we were playing, and out of the blue, no conversation started to this, he just goes, I love turtles. And then leaves it at that, and then we didn't even talk about it afterwards. But I remember that moment so clearly. Meanwhile, I had this tune that I've been writing,

67
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:30,961
uh, that renamed, like, Titleist. So after that interaction, I named this tune Kevin's Turtle.

I want to say thanks to the organizer, thanks to Jonathan, Abby, Terry, and everyone, actually, for having us. It's a pleasure, and I hope we can come back.

Yesterday we had Jonathan and myself, the Allied Project, and we have Mexican De Samba. So you've heard a lot of different kinds of music. And then today, obviously, we had some real flavorful jazz with Ivana Cuesta and the Berklee Jazz and Gender Justice Institute.

94

We're going to take it to a whole nother door now. All right, so listen. Every once in a while, if you're nice to your friends, they'll be nice to you. So I just want to say, these folks, we kind of go way back. And I'm going to start with Donna McElroy, our vocalist. I don't know if any of you have heard of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.

95
01:07:25,525 --> 01:07:44,122
I'm at least one alum in the audience, and I'm an alum myself. And Fisk University in the 1870s sent a group called the Jubilee Singers, basically who all the crowned heads of state in Europe, and they raised enough money to come back and actually fund the school.

96
01:07:44,122 --> 01:08:12,286
And that group of jubilee singers still exists today, and they are world-renowned and well, well-traveled. And Donna McElroy was one of those jubilee singers back in the days at this university. She has since elevated herself a number of times, Grammy-nominated, traveled throughout the United States and the globe, singing just about everything with just about everybody.

97
01:08:12,286 --> 01:08:34,848
She's the chair emeritus of the voice department at Berklee College of Music. So give a big hand to Donna McElroy. Okay, I'm still at Berklee. Making people behave, on the drums, Sean Skeet.

98
01:08:40,687 --> 01:08:59,435
I should have mentioned that. And then, my man, we've been friends forever. Our time together goes back to him as music minister at Jubilee Christian Church, but it was the Covenant at the time, not the Jubilee Club. But this is the inestimable George Russell Jr.

99
01:09:05,881 --> 01:09:16,343
all right and then back on the big sexy head you can see it the hourglass shape

100
01:09:23,212 --> 01:09:40,036
have their day. They are musicians at play and they are about to slay. I'm a poet, y'all know it. Let's do it. George Russell, Donna McElroy, Sean Ferrius, and Sean Skeet, live in the human color.
