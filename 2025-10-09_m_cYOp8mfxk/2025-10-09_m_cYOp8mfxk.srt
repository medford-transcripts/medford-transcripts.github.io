1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:01,195
do do

2
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:30,298
[SPEAKER_00]: years now and this year in particular we've just had a lot of help so a few thank yous before I turn it over to this amazing band.

3
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,827
[SPEAKER_00]: First to the West Medford Community Center, historic space

4
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,112
[SPEAKER_00]: We were showing some of the performers around inside earlier, and there's a lot there.

5
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:43,294
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of history, a lot of amazing artists who have come from this place.

6
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:50,478
[SPEAKER_00]: So in between sets, I really hope you'll go inside, take advantage of the Danish Pastry House, who has set up headquarters there.

7
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:53,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been eating a lot of it, and everything just keeps getting better.

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,441
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.

9
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:59,002
[SPEAKER_00]: So also to the Arts Alive Foundation, Medford Foundation.

10
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:07,698
[SPEAKER_00]: They've really helped us financial support Morningside Music Studio, the Medford Arts Council, Triangle Manor.

11
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:14,582
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some beautiful t-shirts up there with two of our volunteers who are also involved in eating Danish pastry house.

12
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:22,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Berkeley's Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice, which is where this band is from.

13
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,651
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard them playing a little earlier.

14
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,012
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded incredible.

15
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:38,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Terry will tell you more about the history later, but it's a beautiful way of bringing that program full circle with where Terry Lynn Carrington, who's a legendary drummer from around here, really got her start, which was here.

16
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:42,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Her parents are still involved in this community.

17
00:01:43,785 --> 00:01:49,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you also to our Patreon members, who are folks just like you, put in a couple dollars a month.

18
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:54,750
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps us pay for things like jam sessions, for the actual festival itself.

19
00:01:56,251 --> 00:02:05,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years it's really added up in a meaningful way, so if you're looking to get involved, there are numerous QR codes that you can scan to find out more about that.

20
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:10,638
[SPEAKER_00]: To the people working the cameras, Medford Community Media, you three have gone above and beyond.

21
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:16,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking at least one camera would be great, but now we have three.

22
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:20,552
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to get high quality video.

23
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:23,853
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also being live streamed for those who couldn't be here in person.

24
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:33,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, to the Winchester Community Music School, to EXP Realty, and to Staples for our wonderful programs here.

25
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:39,898
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, of course, to our volunteers and staff, to Shayla, my partner, who's done basically everything.

26
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,993
[SPEAKER_00]: To Reese and Eva up there, the tables.

27
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:50,295
[SPEAKER_00]: And to Bruce, who's been also stepping in and doing just about everything.

28
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:57,176
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'll turn it over to Terry Carter, who manages many different things here at the Community Center.

29
00:02:57,497 --> 00:03:01,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the former Poet Laureate of Medford, has written a lot of stuff.

30
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:07,759
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of you saw him yesterday as part of our project, the Ally Project, but really couldn't do this without him.

31
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's gonna tell you

32
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Love that, that's cool.

33
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:21,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me just take you through where we've been so far.

34
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:42,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So on Friday night, we started out with a student night, and it's very interesting because most of the students were of the older, more mature variety, and they're from Morningside Music School, and they put together two different bands, and they were fantastic, phenomenal,

35
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:55,495
[SPEAKER_06]: quite delightful, and then Anita Wood came, Anita came from Medford, not originally from Medford, but grew up a good portion of her childhood here, and she brought her band, it was called A.J.

36
00:03:55,555 --> 00:04:12,503
[SPEAKER_06]: and the Groove, and they were similarly wonderful, so that was night one, and then yesterday afternoon, we started out with Brazilian Flavor, with Recita de Samba, featuring Anna Borges and Bill Ward, and they were smoking hot, so.

37
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:23,446
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, as Jonathan said, the Ally Project, featuring myself and Jonathan, great Toro, and great drummer, Gordon Engelthal, we finished up.

38
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:36,496
[SPEAKER_06]: So today, we're into a new groove, and it's Berklee's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, under the leadership of Terry Lynn Carrington.

39
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:43,158
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, from the Institute, we have Jan Portage on bass.

40
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:48,121
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's got the big sexy today, all right?

41
00:04:48,441 --> 00:04:51,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the biggest bass you're going to see this weekend.

42
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:53,945
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have Yujin Han on piano.

43
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:59,268
[SPEAKER_06]: My man in yellow here, Fall Ray on sax.

44
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:23,915
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a drummer, she's a composer, she's an educator from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and she's known for her powerful artistry and ability to blend diverse musical traditions.

45
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:24,696
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see all this.

46
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:34,385
[SPEAKER_06]: She holds degrees from Dominican Republic Music Conservatory and Berklee College of Music, where she studied with well-known artists including Neil Smith,

47
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:39,988
[SPEAKER_06]: the aforementioned Terry Lynn Carrington, Francisco Mela, and others.

48
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,750
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a compelling live performer.

49
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,750
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna see all this.

50
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:48,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And she is leading up a band that really, really smokes.

51
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:51,776
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna get out the way and let them do what they do.

52
00:05:52,136 --> 00:06:01,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to day three of the Medford Jazz Festival at the West Historic West Medford Community Center.

53
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:04,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies and gentlemen,

54
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Devon Equesta and the Berkley Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice.

55
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:11,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them do their thing.

56
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:42,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guys.

57
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:44,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having us.

58
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:46,977
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure for us to be here.

59
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:48,818
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an amazing place.

60
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:51,520
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first time here, and maybe all of us, right?

61
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,720
[SPEAKER_01]: First time?

62
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:52,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

63
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for the invitation.

64
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:09,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Terry said before, my name is Ivana Cuesta, and I'm part of the Gas and Gender Justice Institute, led by Theronine Carrington.

65
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:19,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And the music that we want to read today, it's music composed by women, but also non-binary people.

66
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:21,563
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to try to do is...

67
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:28,212
[SPEAKER_01]: just bring something that sometimes is not well recognized, I would say, in the music industry.

68
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:32,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why, yeah, we just choose really nice tunes.

69
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:38,642
[SPEAKER_01]: But also from some, actually from some of our professors.

70
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:42,445
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first tune that we play, it's called Chaos.

71
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:43,406
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my

72
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:51,752
[SPEAKER_01]: My tunes that I wrote, I think two years ago, and it's in my album, Alert to the Earth.

73
00:14:52,272 --> 00:15:00,836
[SPEAKER_01]: So you maybe had the sense it was a little bit chaotic and really loud and really noisy, but that was how I actually felt.

74
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:03,838
[SPEAKER_01]: the pandemic ends.

75
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:11,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think everyone probably wrote music as a song or something after the pandemic because it was really something that affected all of us.

76
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,042
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next tune that we're going to be playing is Kowtow by Caroline Davis.

77
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:19,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoy.

78
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:52,846
you

79
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:24,976
do

80
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:04,339
Mm.

81
00:24:34,394 --> 00:24:35,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you.

82
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:38,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I just want to introduce really quick the band.

83
00:24:40,016 --> 00:24:43,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Terry actually said before, so we have Eugene on piano.

84
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:45,438
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Jan, right?

85
00:24:45,478 --> 00:24:48,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a German name, I can't.

86
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:50,939
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Jan on bass.

87
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:08,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next tune that we're gonna be playing is called Yoda by Linda Oh.

88
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:27,657
do

89
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:29,354
What?

90
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:47,056
Mm hmm.

91
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,663
[SPEAKER_12]: have fun!

92
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

93
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:35,925
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tune that we just played right now, it's called Amelia, and it's by Melissa Galdana.

94
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:43,550
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably choose a lot of tunes that are written by saxophone players.

95
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,170
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of them are amazing.

96
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:45,571
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

97
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:46,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love it.

98
00:36:47,312 --> 00:36:51,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next tune that we're going to play is a tune that I composed.

99
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:54,576
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called On Going Cycles.

100
00:36:57,267 --> 00:37:12,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say maybe when I was thinking, when I was composing this, I was just thinking like how everything come back to the same place or everything come back again to like harmony basically.

101
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:20,955
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of us are going to start in different points in music, but there is going to be one section where everyone is in unity.

102
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:31,465
[SPEAKER_01]: This track is part of, like I said, also of my album, and it's related with the earth.

103
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:35,667
[SPEAKER_01]: And like how, you know, the seasons and all of that, and we come back again to the beginning.

104
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:41,629
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we think like, oh, we're never going to have summer again after eight months of winter.

105
00:37:42,189 --> 00:37:45,070
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I feel, and I already have nine years living here.

106
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:45,850
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?

107
00:37:48,654 --> 00:37:54,115
[SPEAKER_01]: everything come back in the right time, not sometimes when we want it, but when we need it.

108
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:56,676
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is ongoing cycle.

109
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:21,922
do do

110
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:19,778
[SPEAKER_12]: do

111
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:28,701
so

112
00:46:29,303 --> 00:46:30,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Ivana told me to say something.

113
00:46:31,604 --> 00:46:32,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is it.

114
00:46:34,046 --> 00:46:36,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

115
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:37,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for being here.

116
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:38,489
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Paul.

117
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:40,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

118
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:43,371
[SPEAKER_04]: This next song is mine.

119
00:46:43,812 --> 00:46:45,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought I would introduce it.

120
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:47,634
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a quick story to tell with it.

121
00:46:49,295 --> 00:46:52,777
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's this piano player who teaches at Berkeley and lives in Boston.

122
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:53,978
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Kevin Harris.

123
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:55,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody know Kevin?

124
00:46:57,788 --> 00:47:00,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin's amazing, he's been an amazing friend and mentor to me.

125
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:14,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had him over at my house a couple weeks ago, and we were playing, and out of the blue, no conversation started to this, he just goes, I love turtles.

126
00:47:15,758 --> 00:47:18,639
[SPEAKER_04]: And then leaves it at that, and then we didn't even talk about it afterwards.

127
00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:20,720
[SPEAKER_04]: But I remember that moment so clearly.

128
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:23,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, I had this tune that I've been writing,

129
00:47:24,655 --> 00:47:26,417
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, that renamed, like, Titleist.

130
00:47:26,857 --> 00:47:29,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So after that interaction, I named this tune Kevin's Turtle.

131
00:48:33,126 --> 00:48:33,186
do

132
00:55:57,696 --> 00:56:01,878
okay so we're gonna do one more

133
00:56:20,917 --> 00:56:21,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?

134
00:56:21,598 --> 00:56:22,178
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, perfect.

135
00:56:23,899 --> 00:56:32,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so the last one that we're going to do is called Smoking Gun, and it's by a saxophone player, Diane Stevens.

136
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:37,049
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say thank you so much, everyone.

137
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:46,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say thanks to the organizer, thanks to Jonathan, Abby, Terry, and everyone, actually, for having us.

138
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:49,758
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure, and I hope we can come back.

139
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:52,340
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.

140
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:57,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.

141
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:32,317
[SPEAKER_12]: do

142
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,787
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why you have engineers, because that's regular people.

143
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,508
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know where the heck we are on stage.

144
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:41,165
[SPEAKER_06]: In any case, ladies and gentlemen, Berklee's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, featuring Ivana Cuesta, on bass.

145
01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:49,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Kordish, on the keyboard, Eugene Hahn.

146
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:55,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the saxophone, big and little, Paul Ray.

147
01:02:59,837 --> 01:03:02,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a pleasure to hear y'all play.

148
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:03,880
[SPEAKER_06]: You're wonderful.

149
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:10,024
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta send a thank you note to Terry Lynn for releasing y'all to come over and hang out with us for an afternoon.

150
01:03:11,005 --> 01:03:17,930
[SPEAKER_06]: And we wish you continuing success in your studies and your teaching and all of the different things that you're doing right now.

151
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:22,533
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an amazing ensemble and we've been blessed by your performance today.

152
01:03:22,553 --> 01:03:24,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very, very much.

153
01:03:25,882 --> 01:03:26,703
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, all right.

154
01:03:26,743 --> 01:03:29,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to take a little pause for the cause.

155
01:03:29,526 --> 01:03:32,829
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to make the changeover between performers.

156
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:37,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be back as soon as we can and get this party started again.

157
01:03:37,373 --> 01:03:39,475
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been a wonderful audience.

158
01:03:39,495 --> 01:03:40,416
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate you.

159
01:03:40,656 --> 01:03:42,217
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to go anywhere.

160
01:03:42,558 --> 01:03:43,779
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go inside.

161
01:03:43,899 --> 01:03:46,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Danish Pastry House has got deliciousness.

162
01:03:47,262 --> 01:03:48,683
[SPEAKER_06]: spread across two tables.

163
01:03:49,323 --> 01:03:51,804
[SPEAKER_06]: There's liquid inside to keep yourself hydrated.

164
01:03:52,964 --> 01:04:01,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you pay attention to all the different donation stations that are around for the community center and for the jazz festival itself.

165
01:04:02,128 --> 01:04:08,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I have, if you weren't here yesterday you might not know about this, but I have my poetry books upstairs on the table.

166
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:11,831
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have t-shirts if you'd like to take a look.

167
01:04:11,871 --> 01:04:16,353
[SPEAKER_06]: They're $25 a pop, but the color is beautiful and the design is just as good.

168
01:04:17,474 --> 01:04:19,615
[SPEAKER_06]: So make yourselves comfortable.

169
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:22,656
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to have you back, so enjoy yourselves.

170
01:04:37,028 --> 01:04:39,990
Hello everyone.

171
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:43,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Come from far and wide, young and old.

172
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:11,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Real big applause for my man.

173
01:05:55,343 --> 01:06:07,270
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on the Jamaican side where she has to have all the jobs.

174
01:06:09,391 --> 01:06:12,473
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we're at day three.

175
01:06:13,173 --> 01:06:18,076
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you who haven't been here, we have had a little bit of everything.

176
01:06:18,496 --> 01:06:19,757
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had the morning side.

177
01:06:27,069 --> 01:06:30,090
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the Morningside Jazz All-Star, Thursday night.

178
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:32,010
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got the Needlewood, A.J.

179
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,850
[SPEAKER_06]: in the Room, Thursday night.

180
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:42,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Yesterday we had Jonathan and myself, the Allied Project, and we have Mexican De Samba.

181
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:45,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've heard a lot of different kinds of music.

182
01:06:45,673 --> 01:06:54,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And then today, obviously, we had some real flavorful jazz with Ivana Cuesta and the Berklee Jazz and Gender Justice Institute.

183
01:06:56,395 --> 01:06:58,997
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take it to a whole nother door now.

184
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:00,459
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so listen.

185
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Every once in a while, if you're nice to your friends, they'll be nice to you.

186
01:07:07,365 --> 01:07:12,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to say, these folks, we kind of go way back.

187
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:16,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to start with Donna McElroy, our vocalist.

188
01:07:18,355 --> 01:07:22,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if any of you have heard of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.

189
01:07:25,545 --> 01:07:28,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm at least one alum in the audience, and I'm an alum myself.

190
01:07:28,928 --> 01:07:43,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And Fisk University in the 1870s sent a group called the Jubilee Singers, basically who all the crowned heads of state in Europe, and they raised enough money to come back and actually fund the school.

191
01:07:44,482 --> 01:07:51,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And that group of jubilee singers still exists today, and they are world-renowned and well, well-traveled.

192
01:07:51,789 --> 01:07:58,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And Donna McElroy was one of those jubilee singers back in the days at this university.

193
01:07:58,054 --> 01:08:12,046
[SPEAKER_06]: She has since elevated herself a number of times, Grammy-nominated, traveled throughout the United States and the globe, singing just about everything with just about everybody.

194
01:08:12,867 --> 01:08:18,993
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the chair emeritus of the voice department at Berklee College of Music.

195
01:08:19,613 --> 01:08:25,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So give a big hand to Donna McElroy.

196
01:08:25,639 --> 01:08:28,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm still at Berklee.

197
01:08:30,123 --> 01:08:34,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Making people behave, on the drums, Sean Skeet.

198
01:08:40,687 --> 01:08:42,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have mentioned that.

199
01:08:42,128 --> 01:08:44,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, my man, we've been friends forever.

200
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:53,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Our time together goes back to him as music minister at Jubilee Christian Church, but it was the Covenant at the time, not the Jubilee Club.

201
01:08:53,572 --> 01:08:58,615
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is the inestimable George Russell Jr.

202
01:09:06,061 --> 01:09:14,158
[SPEAKER_06]: all right and then back on the big sexy head you can see it the hourglass shape

203
01:09:23,352 --> 01:09:24,253
[SPEAKER_06]: have their day.

204
01:09:25,455 --> 01:09:29,401
[SPEAKER_06]: They are musicians at play and they are about to slay.

205
01:09:29,821 --> 01:09:31,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a poet, y'all know it.

206
01:09:31,504 --> 01:09:32,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it.

207
01:09:33,847 --> 01:09:40,036
[SPEAKER_06]: George Russell, Donna McElroy, Sean Ferrius, and Sean Skeet, live in the human color.

208
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:54,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad that happened before we got started.

209
01:10:01,225 --> 01:10:05,548
[SPEAKER_02]: You cute, you cute, you cute, and you know it too.

[SPEAKER_11]: And suddenly, something in your eyes I see Soon begins bewitching me It's that old devil moon That just stole from the skies that old

216
01:14:51,204 --> 01:14:55,845
[SPEAKER_11]: You and your plans make this romance so hard to handle.

[SPEAKER_11]: No weeping or a wailing, or fainting in need.

389
02:01:00,377 --> 02:01:28,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't need a moon or the glow Your trumpets were the strings That'd be too soon to know anyway Who answers when that bell rings Yet I do when I look into your eyes My lonely days were through And all the fireworks and riots in the world Couldn't make it any more true That no bell

390
02:01:30,198 --> 02:01:34,461
[SPEAKER_11]: A whistle's the warning of my pending fall.

403
02:04:45,290 --> 02:05:11,361
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be too soon to know anyway Who answers when that bell rings Yet I knew when I looked into your eyes My lonely days were through And all the fireworks and rockets in the world Couldn't make it any more true That no bells Could warn me of my dimly followed clue

404
02:05:13,156 --> 02:05:41,608
[SPEAKER_11]: That this would be the sweetest dream of all No heartfelt invitation R.S.P.P'd in grand style No abstract provocation No more TV vacation I'm gonna live my days in just your smile If I could have another one

405
02:05:46,005 --> 02:05:47,526
[SPEAKER_10]: What's to say?

406
02:05:48,526 --> 02:06:00,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Marry me, baby Love is forever What's for dinner?

407
02:06:01,012 --> 02:06:06,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we ready?

408
02:06:08,356 --> 02:06:13,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing can take away the joy of your smile

[SPEAKER_03]: He said I like the dab.

412
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:45,732
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he didn't like it a little lot, he liked it a lot lot.

413
02:06:45,992 --> 02:06:47,372
[SPEAKER_03]: A real, real, real big lot.

414
02:06:54,048 --> 02:06:54,969
[SPEAKER_10]: God bless you.

415
02:06:55,409 --> 02:06:58,513
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll get your number at the end of the show.

419
02:07:17,310 --> 02:07:19,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there's any tissues.

420
02:07:20,133 --> 02:07:21,014

[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a tissue over here for you.

424
02:07:30,483 --> 02:07:33,766
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called Why Can't We Live Together.

425
02:07:33,826 --> 02:07:40,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote it back in the days of the assault on Rodney King.

426
02:07:40,731 --> 02:07:45,415
[SPEAKER_11]: They did the interview with him, and he asked him, why can't we just get along?

427
02:07:46,656 --> 02:07:50,539
[SPEAKER_11]: And right after that, this song came on my heart.

428
