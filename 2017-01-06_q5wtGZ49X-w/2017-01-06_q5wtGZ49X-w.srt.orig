31
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:50,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

32
00:01:50,306 --> 00:02:03,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I want to thank Barbara and the building committee and the friends of the library for the hard work that they've done over the last six months to get the project to this point.

33
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:03,634
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean,

34
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:21,327
[SPEAKER_15]: This money has been available to communities for the last four years, and under Barbara's leadership, we finally have the library committee coming to Medford, and the grant is at a point where it should be now.

35
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:27,310
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the mayor, with her staff, has done almost a year's worth of work in five months.

36
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:32,614
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to congratulate the mayor, and her staff, and Barbara and her staff, and the friends of the library.

37
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,729
[SPEAKER_15]: forgetting, forgetting us to this point.

38
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:46,871
[SPEAKER_15]: And hopefully, uh, there's, there's a large grant out there that will be available and hopefully we'll be able to get it and bring the library up to the, to, uh, the standard that it should be for the people of this community.

39
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:47,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

40
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:48,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

41
00:02:48,392 --> 00:02:51,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Counselor, madam librarian.

42
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:54,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I have our architect with us.

43
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Shall I have her come up as well?

44
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:56,893
[SPEAKER_06]: If she would like.

45
00:02:57,353 --> 00:03:01,374
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have the solicitor here, uh, Mark Rumley, who's here to share.

46
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:04,437
[SPEAKER_06]: some information that might be pertinent to our discussions.

47
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:06,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead with your presentation, Barbara.

48
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:13,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:13,802
[SPEAKER_14]: What am I doing?

50
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:15,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, welcome.

51
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:17,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Please say your name and address for the record.

52
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:20,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Barbara Kerr, 35 Baker Place, Newton, Massachusetts.

53
00:03:22,627 --> 00:03:22,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

54
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:23,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

55
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:26,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us about this project.

56
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this is a grant program that the Board of Library Commission

57
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,370
[SPEAKER_14]: commissioners runs.

58
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,732
[SPEAKER_14]: It comes up every decade or so.

59
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:38,574
[SPEAKER_14]: It pays for about 42% of a construction project.

60
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:41,096
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been working on it since April.

61
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:44,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually it's a two-year project, but we jumped in the middle.

62
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,139
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've been working on it since April.

63
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:53,263
[SPEAKER_14]: The grant goes in at the end of January, and we hear whether we got a grant and where we are on the list.

64
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:55,244
[SPEAKER_14]: If we did get a grant, we'll hear at the end of July.

65
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:57,905
[SPEAKER_14]: We got together.

66
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,246
[SPEAKER_14]: We had to put together

67
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:03,499
[SPEAKER_14]: two possible schematics, one for a renovation and one for a new building.

68
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,700
[SPEAKER_14]: We looked at them.

69
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,240
[SPEAKER_14]: We went through several variations.

70
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:09,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Angela did a lot of back and forth with them.

71
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:13,384
[SPEAKER_14]: And the building committee decided unanimously that we wanted a new building.

72
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:22,249
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a differential in cost of $600,000 to a million dollars, which is still a big chunk of money, but comparatively speaking, it isn't.

73
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:23,190
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was

74
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:39,660
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of discussion about the fact that because our building is so old and it was built before the current building codes were written, that there were likely to be unanticipated expenses during the renovation that might bring the cost up to where the new building would be.

75
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,661
[SPEAKER_14]: the latest new building floor plans with you.

76
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:50,342
[SPEAKER_14]: The new building, taking down the current building, putting up a new one, allows us to maximize the space.

77
00:04:50,982 --> 00:05:03,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Because even though it is a whole block, it's a very constrained space, and we have accessibility issues, if you know, if you've ever tried to come in the back door, because it comes in, and you have to go upstairs or downstairs to get anywhere.

78
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:10,407
[SPEAKER_14]: So being able to take down a building allows us to adjust the, thank you, adjust the grade, the grade, right, yes.

79
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:15,190
[SPEAKER_14]: so that when you come in the back door, you come in on a floor, you're not at stairs.

80
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:26,098
[SPEAKER_14]: And in addition to that, because it's a new building, it can sort of be slanted out on the corners, which added about 4,000 square feet to the design, which let us put everything that we wanted to put into it.

81
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:30,561
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we had done a renovation, we couldn't have fit everything that we fit in a new building.

82
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,023
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's where we stand.

83
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:38,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And it takes into account a lot of the issues regarding ledge there, water runoff and all of that.

84
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:44,325
[SPEAKER_09]: So my name is Angela Hyatt.

85
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:45,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm an architect in Boston.

86
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:46,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

87
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,249
[SPEAKER_09]: My address is 87 Walnut Street in Brookline.

88
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm an architect that specializes in libraries.

89
00:05:55,011 --> 00:06:00,715
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were hired by the building committee almost exactly two and a half months ago.

90
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:08,680
[SPEAKER_09]: So even though they've been working on the project for a few months, we've come in kind of to the tail end and been

91
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:16,075
[SPEAKER_09]: working nonstop here to catch up and get all the requirements in place for the grant.

92
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:34,287
[SPEAKER_09]: As part of the grant actually anticipates that some, the grant requirements anticipate that some projects will encounter subsurface conditions that might make a project more expensive than another.

93
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:37,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And so part of the grant requirements is to do a geotechnical

94
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:41,897
[SPEAKER_09]: a full geotechnical survey and analysis, and so we've done that.

95
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:44,999
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually was just completed a couple weeks ago.

96
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:55,127
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that there is ledge there, and so for that reason, we are not anticipating going down an extra story like we typically might here in New England.

97
00:06:56,228 --> 00:07:05,495
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, the proposed building footprint is similar to what exists now, but because the second floor is built out,

98
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:10,152
[SPEAKER_09]: gets us the extra square footage needed to meet the library program goals.

99
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:23,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And what inspired some of the more contemporary lines and swoops, it's almost a retro-contemporary, one could even wonder should this be

100
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:26,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Brady architects, if you look at some of the sketches.

101
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:26,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be.

102
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:35,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yes, what exists now is pretty much exactly a Mike Brady architecture.

103
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:38,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just say, we are very early in the design process.

104
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,852
[SPEAKER_09]: We are still in schematic design.

105
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:44,614
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's part of the requirements for the grant is to submit a schematic design.

106
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:49,617
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just started this design phase a couple of weeks ago.

107
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:55,304
[SPEAKER_09]: So everything at this point is, especially the building exterior, is very malleable.

108
00:07:55,804 --> 00:08:02,392
[SPEAKER_09]: What the library commissioners are primarily looking at is the interior floor plan and the arrangement of

109
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:07,379
[SPEAKER_09]: stacks and furniture and spaces to make sure that the functional arrangement is correct.

110
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:22,735
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're just dipping our toes into the exterior and we thought it would be appropriate to do a building that was mostly brick because of the history of brick manufacturing in Medford.

111
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:25,898
[SPEAKER_09]: And since we're not replacing historic building, we didn't feel

112
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:29,590
[SPEAKER_09]: confined to recreate something that didn't exist.

113
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

114
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:41,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And the use of, just a brief look at it, the use of light in open space and natural lighting in there is a wonderful addition to that building.

115
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:42,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

116
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:58,140
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the most important library planning principles is to design space that is flexible and open and doesn't have a lot of unnecessary interior walls because we can't really anticipate what is going to be 10 or 20 years out.

117
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,923
[SPEAKER_09]: So keeping it open and flexible is important.

118
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:04,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

119
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:06,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

120
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:08,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

121
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:10,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being here tonight.

122
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:23,460
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did have the opportunity to go to the last library meeting and you had a great presentation with regard to the look and the feel of the inside of a library, hopefully in the future.

123
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:35,482
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was wondering if you could elaborate more on that as to the difference between what we currently have and what hopefully we will currently have in the future.

124
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:38,803
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could just tell us a little bit about the look and the feel inside the library.

125
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:45,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what we're going to do, it's going to be, right now we're full and we have about three electrical outlets.

126
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:48,554
[SPEAKER_14]: So if nothing else happens, we'll have a lot more electrical outlets.

127
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:53,037
[SPEAKER_14]: The bottom floor is going to be similar in terms of what's there.

128
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:55,319
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to come in pretty much the same place.

129
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:59,923
[SPEAKER_14]: The right hand side is going to be all the adult collections reference.

130
00:10:00,823 --> 00:10:02,925
[SPEAKER_14]: The local history area is going to have its own room.

131
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:06,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, the nice thing that we've been able to add is if you have this page open,

132
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,346
[SPEAKER_14]: is down here, those are small study rooms.

133
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:15,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the problem with an open plan building, which we've known for 56 years, that noise can be an issue.

134
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,113
[SPEAKER_14]: So instead of putting in walled rooms, we put in these small study spaces.

135
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:22,935
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a piece that wouldn't have fit in a renovation.

136
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,356
[SPEAKER_14]: We could only have had about half the number of those.

137
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:32,060
[SPEAKER_14]: The other half of the bottom floor is gonna be staff area, which will be based on efficiency rather than the plugs.

138
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,561
[SPEAKER_14]: So that'll be a nice change.

139
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:35,963
[SPEAKER_14]: The very nice piece is the second floor.

140
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:43,171
[SPEAKER_14]: The right-hand side, if you're standing with High Street behind you, is a very expanded youth services area.

141
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:46,253
[SPEAKER_14]: So young adults will be on the High Street side.

142
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:47,514
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be a much bigger space.

143
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,695
[SPEAKER_14]: And then children's will be on the other side.

144
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:56,738
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're going to have their own performance space, much bigger, because they're both pretty cramped areas at this point.

145
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:59,760
[SPEAKER_14]: So expanded seating, expanded shelving, nice lighting.

146
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:06,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Samantha wants the columns to look like trees, so we're gonna pursue that at a later point.

147
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:14,447
[SPEAKER_14]: The young adult section is gonna be walled off from children, so they have their own space, but they're going to share a circulation desk and staff, which is very nice.

148
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:16,648
[SPEAKER_14]: The other side is the great piece.

149
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:23,329
[SPEAKER_14]: That's public access space, because as we know, what we're missing right now is public meeting space.

150
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:24,750
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the Magoon Room and that's it.

151
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,811
[SPEAKER_14]: So in this design there, I believe are 15 spaces that can be used for

152
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:32,053
[SPEAKER_14]: public, various public functions.

153
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:33,554
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a whole bunch of small meeting rooms.

154
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:41,462
[SPEAKER_14]: In this public space, there's a new Magoon room, a maker space, a large conference room, a digital media lab.

155
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:46,488
[SPEAKER_14]: There will be a cafe area, and there'll be an art gallery space in the cafe area.

156
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:49,790
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's going to be an open, what's the word?

157
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,413
[SPEAKER_14]: There's going to be an atrium.

158
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:54,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

159
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:56,775
[SPEAKER_14]: So there will be light coming down to below.

160
00:11:56,815 --> 00:12:00,117
[SPEAKER_14]: So it gives us much more room than we have.

161
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:10,365
[SPEAKER_14]: And as Angela said, the open plan design, our building has its issues, but the open plan served us very well for 50 years because we were able to adapt to what came up.

162
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:13,967
[SPEAKER_14]: And libraries are more or less in transition now.

163
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:19,704
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if all it is is books in 40 years, we have the space to put all the books back in.

164
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:23,766
[SPEAKER_14]: But if it's not, we have space to put other things in as well.

165
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:34,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I really like the idea of the group space as far as, which I think is, you know, I think so much work done now at school, you know, there's a lot of group study and, you know, there's a lot of group work.

166
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:38,773
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this is a great idea to incorporate this into the plan.

167
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,922
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing I also like, too, is, I mean, I like the whole design.

168
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:43,822
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really nice.

169
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:45,343
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like it's really well thought out.

170
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:46,984
[SPEAKER_11]: So great job on that.

171
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:51,466
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as the multi-purpose room goes, how many people does that seat?

172
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:55,208
[SPEAKER_11]: And is that suited for giving presentations, all kinds of stuff like that?

173
00:12:55,688 --> 00:13:01,651
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a flat floor, not a raised floor, so that it can be used for a variety of events.

174
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:04,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now, the furniture arrangement is kind of shown

175
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:14,882
[SPEAKER_09]: lecture mode or maybe screening a movie or film, but it's meant to have a variety of different flexible seating options.

176
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:25,991
[SPEAKER_09]: If you count the number of chairs, I think there are a little over a hundred shown in that room, but the building code would allow us to almost double that number.

177
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:34,296
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're encouraged by the library commissioners to show what is a reasonable seating arrangement.

178
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:40,739
[SPEAKER_09]: But if the event called for it, there could be more people in that room.

179
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:42,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

180
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,262
[SPEAKER_14]: The children's performance space, which is on the other side, that's also a fairly large room.

181
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:56,087
[SPEAKER_14]: So that could, at this point, anytime there's a children's performer, they're in the Lagoon Room, but they could actually have their own performances in their own room, which they'd like.

182
00:13:57,142 --> 00:14:12,371
[SPEAKER_09]: And the whole area that's shaded brown on the plans is this kind of after hours zone, this public access zone, which is designed to allow the library to close the rest of the library and leave that open for after hours programming.

183
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:22,277
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not going to be an additional draw on staff to kind of be in all corners of the library when there is a major event going on.

184
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:33,193
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as the, looking at the plan here, as far as the parking goes, I believe, so are those garages coming down?

185
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:40,617
[SPEAKER_14]: It couldn't do that much with it, but it is an addition of 12 spaces, I think.

186
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:40,997
[SPEAKER_11]: 12 spaces?

187
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:41,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

188
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:44,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I had dreamt that it would be more than that, but it can't be.

189
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sorry, back to inside the library, as far as computers,

190
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:53,518
[SPEAKER_11]: technology goes.

191
00:14:53,618 --> 00:15:06,708
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, are we talking... I'm not sure how many computers right now are at the library currently, but I am assuming this will allow us to... Right now, the public computer space in reference has seven computers, and this is 23 plus.

192
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,891
[SPEAKER_14]: And children and young adult will also have their own.

193
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:18,317
[SPEAKER_14]: And the young adult, our teen space, is hooked into this digital media lab, which is gonna have all sorts of computer stations and green screens and things that you can play with.

194
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:20,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

195
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:21,827
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the plan.

196
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I love the idea of a new library.

197
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:32,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, I grew up going to the library when I was a kid and back when I was a kid, they had the satellite libraries and we're going to the library in my neighborhood, but it's great to come down here to the square.

198
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:36,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so I love, you know, the location, the designs really nice.

199
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:41,942
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, you know, I think, uh, this is a huge, a huge investment, but I think it's well worth it.

200
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:46,966
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, you know, I, I think that, you know, if we're going to do it, we have to make sure we do it right.

201
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,548
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, you know, and it needs to be ready for,

202
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,053
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, future generations of Method residents.

203
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:53,875
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, I'm really happy about this.

204
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:58,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I supported a hundred percent and I look forward to hopefully we get, hopefully we get that grant.

205
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,159
[SPEAKER_11]: We can move forward on this.

206
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for all your hard work.

207
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

208
00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:07,205
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing I wanted to make sure everybody understood the vote tonight is not a commitment of any kind.

209
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:11,788
[SPEAKER_14]: This is simply a vote giving us permission to apply for the grant.

210
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:15,171
[SPEAKER_14]: So it doesn't mean we're going to build a library down the road, although I'm sure we will.

211
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:16,312
[SPEAKER_14]: But just so that,

212
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:21,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody thinks we've snuck in a grant, you know, it's not in a building at some point.

213
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:21,465
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't.

214
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:23,907
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

215
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:24,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

216
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:26,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor chair recognizes council Scott Pelly.

217
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:29,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much again, Barbara and the committee.

218
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:43,644
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, I know that, uh, one of the biggest pieces that I, I applaud both, uh, council Kaviello for spearheading this and moving this forward is the, the F the funding mechanism and reaching out to the grant funding.

219
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:44,805
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's so important.

220
00:16:44,825 --> 00:16:45,225
[SPEAKER_16]: I think when,

221
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:55,457
[SPEAKER_16]: we're talking about the big projects we are looking at here in the community and looking what we're trying to do here with the library is a model of success.

222
00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:57,658
[SPEAKER_16]: And I, and I applaud everybody involved.

223
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, it's so exciting.

224
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:00,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, so again,

225
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:02,958
[SPEAKER_16]: the plans look so exciting.

226
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,139
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's so, it's so new.

227
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:07,540
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's, it's, it's refreshing to see.

228
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:21,148
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that one of the only questions I have is as we move forward and looking at typical mistakes we sometimes make in this community is a building and designing of the roof.

229
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,431
[SPEAKER_16]: That's always seems to be the first issue that comes about when you talk about

230
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:29,965
[SPEAKER_16]: construction later on and having the flat roofs in New England.

231
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:43,534
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, but the way it looks like it's, it looks like it's sloped and we're, we're thinking ahead and making sure that we don't have, um, the same issues we have in today's, um, library.

232
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,457
[SPEAKER_16]: So, and I could assume that's correct.

233
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:47,737
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

234
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:52,161
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking at a series of, of kind of gently curving sloped roofs.

235
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, and we have a lot of experience, uh,

236
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:57,780
[SPEAKER_09]: building and designing in New England.

237
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,961
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know exactly what you're talking about.

238
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:25,412
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the last, I know you touched upon it, but having this indoor area being so, um, uh, open and, and, and, and, and new, um, I, I like to even look at, you know, and then a fellow council have already talked about it, so I don't want to be redundant, but the outside plants, I know we said that we'd haven't touched upon that yet, but as I, as we look at some of the designs, are we putting, um,

239
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:33,113
[SPEAKER_16]: interactive areas outside and, and so we can really bring the library outside and that's going to be part of the plan as we move forward.

240
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:40,377
[SPEAKER_16]: I know the front page, you know, we can see more trees and areas, but can you expand on that a little bit?

241
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:49,803
[SPEAKER_14]: So the hillside Avenue side now that is grass is going to stay because at the top of that hill is a beach tree that's from the mid 19th century.

242
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:51,885
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're not building out on that side.

243
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:52,085
[SPEAKER_14]: So

244
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:59,053
[SPEAKER_14]: we are expecting to landscape and create some kind of park area that is unfortunately not covered by the library grant.

245
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:00,054
[SPEAKER_16]: That's okay.

246
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:17,766
[SPEAKER_16]: But with the tree staying and I know that was important, but again, I applaud everybody's effort with this moving forward and I'm in total, uh, support 1000% and, uh, very excited by the way that being creative with the funding and, um, and there's the design especially.

247
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:18,627
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you very much.

248
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

249
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:22,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Vice President Luebel-Kern.

250
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President de la Ruzo.

251
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Barbara and your team for working on this.

252
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:36,100
[SPEAKER_13]: A few questions with regards to the 42 percent.

253
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you kind of explain what we're looking at for pricing down the line?

254
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:44,125
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the cost estimate?

255
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:47,147
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that seems like it's just going to be for construction.

256
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,008
[SPEAKER_13]: So what does that not include?

257
00:19:49,637 --> 00:20:05,303
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I know you said you'll hear if we do get the grant by around the end of July, what's the timeframe with regards to when we have to commit to come up with the full amount and when will we have to start construction?

258
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:08,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me answer the second part first, if that's okay.

259
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:08,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect.

260
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:12,366
[SPEAKER_14]: What they do is they create a waiting list.

261
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,247
[SPEAKER_14]: There'll be one group that,

262
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:16,858
[SPEAKER_14]: The money is available for the first year.

263
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:21,620
[SPEAKER_14]: The way it works is they have been promised $120 million for this grant round.

264
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,941
[SPEAKER_14]: 100 and what?

265
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:24,601
[SPEAKER_14]: 120 million.

266
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:24,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

267
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:31,004
[SPEAKER_14]: But the state releases it, and they don't know how much is going to be released every year.

268
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,685
[SPEAKER_14]: It all depends on how the state budgeting process works out.

269
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:39,548
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first group, their money will be available next July.

270
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:43,730
[SPEAKER_14]: And their projects will probably be paid for over the course of two or three years.

271
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:46,811
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they go to the next group on the list and down and down.

272
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:48,914
[SPEAKER_14]: We are not falling down.

273
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,698
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are probably not going to be in the first group.

274
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:56,566
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the sort of the high priority group that are really in sort of desperate circumstances.

275
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:57,227
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one that's

276
00:20:57,751 --> 00:21:00,052
[SPEAKER_14]: being demolished to put a road in.

277
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:03,914
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think they're first, but we could be in the first group.

278
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:11,998
[SPEAKER_14]: If we were in the first group, the council would have to vote on accepting the money within six months and construction has to start within 18 months.

279
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:16,039
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we were in the first group, we could be starting work as early as 2018.

280
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think we are.

281
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,603
[SPEAKER_14]: The indicators I've gotten from the library commissioners people is that we would be a little further down the list.

282
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:29,033
[SPEAKER_14]: And they pay for some parts of it and others they don't.

283
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:33,794
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you each have this document, the sort of grayed out pieces.

284
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,894
[SPEAKER_14]: You have one, right?

285
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:35,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

286
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:35,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

287
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,175
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of hard to read there.

288
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:46,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I put in the far right hand column, um, anything that is not eligible for the grant reimbursement is, is noted.

289
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:52,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's roughly in the end, um, things that aren't eligible are site work.

290
00:21:53,438 --> 00:22:01,426
[SPEAKER_09]: parking, furniture, computers, site acquisition costs, which you don't have to worry about.

291
00:22:03,668 --> 00:22:06,390
[SPEAKER_09]: In the end, it works out to roughly 50% of the total project cost.

292
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:14,264
[SPEAKER_14]: And we recently did the calculation they have and it's actually going to be 11 million at this point.

293
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:16,245
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not our final project cost.

294
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:18,426
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is the draft.

295
00:22:18,446 --> 00:22:20,007
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's going to be 11 million.

296
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:21,827
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll probably be a little bit more than that.

297
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:25,089
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is also 11 million as far as what?

298
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,090
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we will get from the state commission.

299
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:31,371
[SPEAKER_14]: And there will be is a little bit additional money.

300
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:35,093
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's about 300,000 for a green incentive grant that we are going to pursue.

301
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:37,454
[SPEAKER_13]: And I see here on the,

302
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:39,733
[SPEAKER_13]: break down that you just gave us.

303
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:49,459
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a reimbursement grant, so we would have to go out to bond or take from free cash for the full amount, and then can you explain how the reimbursement works?

304
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it after completion of the entire project or as we're spending?

305
00:22:55,022 --> 00:23:04,648
[SPEAKER_09]: It's bracketed, so there is, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, there's a first installment made to pay for design fees.

306
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:17,693
[SPEAKER_09]: there is a kind of, I think, a midpoint through construction or early construction, and then I think they hold the final bit for when it's complete.

307
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:29,264
[SPEAKER_09]: So they recognize that there are some upfront costs before you even get in the ground associated with design and permitting and everything else.

308
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:34,880
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a third a third a third or something like that.

309
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:41,327
[SPEAKER_14]: This document has more details about the budgeting which I don't entirely understand.

310
00:23:41,347 --> 00:23:46,233
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you said Director Kerr when you said.

311
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,901
[SPEAKER_13]: the first group will there be?

312
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:50,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there usually a number?

313
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Do they pick three or four projects, or is it five or six?

314
00:23:53,644 --> 00:24:00,988
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean... It depends on... There are so many variables in this because there are 34 libraries applying of very varying sizes.

315
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:06,252
[SPEAKER_14]: We are actually on the big size, big... You know what I mean.

316
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:16,478
[SPEAKER_14]: So it will all depend on how much money is released to them the first year and how much the different projects are going to cost.

317
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:30,468
[SPEAKER_09]: In past grant rounds, I think there have been kind of that seven to nine or something around there, just kind of as a placeholder to understand how many are released initially.

318
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:33,169
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the last grant round, they gave 17 grants.

319
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:40,733
[SPEAKER_14]: And in this grant, there are two Boston branches, a Cambridge branch, and the Newton Library, who are the big guys.

320
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:41,674
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's us.

321
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:43,675
[SPEAKER_14]: And then everybody else is smaller than we are.

322
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:46,076
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're kind of standalone.

323
00:24:47,504 --> 00:24:50,246
[SPEAKER_13]: So in the last round, they gave 17 out of how many that applied?

324
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:50,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably about 35.

325
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:59,754
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have all those grants from the last round, probably, that reapplied for a second time?

326
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:00,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them.

327
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:01,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Some did.

328
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:04,217
[SPEAKER_14]: It has been 10 years, so a lot of people did it on their own.

329
00:25:04,598 --> 00:25:04,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, gotcha.

330
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,119
[SPEAKER_14]: And our chances seem to be very good.

331
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,981
[SPEAKER_14]: We've gotten very, very positive feedback from Weber.

332
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:26,832
[SPEAKER_09]: As an architect, just anecdotally, going to a lot of these walkthroughs of other communities that are interested in doing this whole process that we're doing for you, I came away from some of these walkthroughs of their present facilities thinking,

333
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are they applying for a grant?

334
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:40,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I think having a building that's of your vintage that really hasn't been expanded or changed in over 50 years, I think it's going to work in your favor.

335
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:46,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't think our building has even been maintained.

336
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,480
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a little, they put in new ceilings.

337
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Minimally maintained.

338
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:51,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Minimally, yeah.

339
00:25:52,141 --> 00:25:57,063
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've never had any construction grant funding before we've ever done a renovation.

340
00:25:57,864 --> 00:26:00,325
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're a city, which is kind of a plus.

341
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:07,608
[SPEAKER_14]: They consider us an urban environment, which a lot of the others are little towns or affluent suburbs.

342
00:26:07,688 --> 00:26:09,109
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have an edge, I think.

343
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:11,930
[SPEAKER_13]: And can you remind us of the age of the building?

344
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,391
[SPEAKER_13]: It was originally built in?

345
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:13,931
[SPEAKER_13]: 56, in 1959 it was built.

346
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:18,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Designed in 56, yeah.

347
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:23,021
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all the questions I have for now.

348
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:30,363
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is something that this council begged for, and that Councilor Carviello helped move forward months and months ago.

349
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:42,247
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, just seeing the roof look like it's going to collapse with the tiles all missing, especially in the children's area, was a big concern of mine, and it's something that needs bathrooms are concerns of other councilors.

350
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:46,260
[SPEAKER_13]: each piece of the library needs to be updated and maintained.

351
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,002
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think adding the second floor is also something that we wanted to pursue.

352
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:52,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, this is a lot of money.

353
00:26:52,643 --> 00:27:10,292
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, I asked that obviously some of the questions we had in our prior meeting, I think last week with regards to the police station and where we're going to get, you were going to take that money from too, is it's important to kind of know where we're going to be, how we're going to be able to do a number of these projects that need to be done.

354
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:12,033
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully the mayor will be able to,

355
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,809
[SPEAKER_13]: talk to us more and really start planning.

356
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,692
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the first step, and I think it's important to apply for the grant so that we have that option.

357
00:27:20,893 --> 00:27:42,246
[SPEAKER_14]: And one thing I'd like to mention is I've been talking to Bloomberg Philanthropy since we started this process, and they're not willing to give me a dollar amount to put in the application, but Mayor Bloomberg is writing a support letter for the grant, so I'm optimistic about a good relationship with them going forward, because his mother was a big library user, and they told me he's excited about the project.

358
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:45,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thank you for all your hard work and we appreciate it.

359
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:46,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

360
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam vice president chair recognizes counselor night.

361
00:27:50,021 --> 00:27:51,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

362
00:27:51,362 --> 00:27:51,802
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ms.

363
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:52,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Kerr, thank you for being here this evening.

364
00:27:53,863 --> 00:27:59,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this project looks like it's going to expand the library to about 44,000 gross square feet.

365
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:01,947
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we at right now?

366
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:05,549
[SPEAKER_02]: 29 29 so it almost gives us almost double hopeful.

367
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:06,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite, but close.

368
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:10,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do you think that based on the current staffing levels, you have enough,

369
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:16,100
[SPEAKER_02]: personnel to operate the facility once it, if we're lucky enough to receive the grant.

370
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have enough staff and personnel?

371
00:28:17,602 --> 00:28:19,344
[SPEAKER_14]: We will need to add some extra people.

372
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:23,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, because it's on one level, it can be staffed with a fairly

373
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:25,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Just two or three people.

374
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:30,221
[SPEAKER_14]: But if there is a second level, you shouldn't have fewer than three people up there at one time.

375
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:35,326
[SPEAKER_14]: So I calculated roughly that it would be 175 hours of staffing that we would need to have.

376
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:37,248
[SPEAKER_14]: But that could be a mixture of full-time and part-time.

377
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:38,028
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it would be.

378
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:39,870
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be crippling, I hope.

379
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:40,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Or robots.

380
00:28:41,131 --> 00:28:42,152
[SPEAKER_14]: But we haven't got enough.

381
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:44,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I think that if you need the staff, you do the staff.

382
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:45,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not a problem.

383
00:28:45,675 --> 00:28:57,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at this, Mr. President, this is something that the council's requested on multiple occasions to have the administration pursue the Board of Library Commissioners grant funding to expand or construct a new library.

384
00:28:58,281 --> 00:29:06,224
[SPEAKER_02]: If we also look at this, Mr. President, this council and councils in the past have restored funding to allow us to be at a level where we can apply for the grant.

385
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:14,748
[SPEAKER_02]: We've dealt with many maintenance and capital issues related to the library, the roof leaking, some gutters being blocked, and we've invested money there.

386
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:19,911
[SPEAKER_02]: and studies and so on and so forth as to how we're going to move forward and address the present day concerns with the library.

387
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:20,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

388
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:24,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that this is a great approach and a great step forward.

389
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:28,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I congratulate miss Kerr on her hard work in such a short time.

390
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:36,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Being the library director, we've been able to bring this to fruition and um, I really think it's, it's a great measure and it's something that I'm going to be supporting this, uh, this evening, Mr. President.

391
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:38,559
[SPEAKER_02]: So as such move for approval.

392
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, thank you.

393
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Knight on the motion for approval by council night chair recognizes council marks.

394
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:46,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

395
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:49,764
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, I couldn't be more happy.

396
00:29:50,165 --> 00:30:04,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, two years ago, uh, this council had a big borrow and steal to get $10,000 allocated in the budget to fix what I refer to as two prison bathrooms in the library.

397
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:10,621
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, they were painted and some, uh, fixtures were replaced.

398
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:12,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and now we're talking about, uh,

399
00:30:14,117 --> 00:30:24,124
[SPEAKER_10]: possibly a $27 million brand new library, complete with community gathering spaces, which I believe is going to be a home run.

400
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:31,370
[SPEAKER_10]: This library will not only be a library, it'll be a central gathering place for all of the city.

401
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,972
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have big expectations for this building now.

402
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:38,395
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, right.

403
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:39,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad to hear.

404
00:30:39,556 --> 00:30:40,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's been talk about, uh,

405
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:48,194
[SPEAKER_10]: putting in a small cafe where you can get a scone and a cup of coffee, and I think that's a great asset.

406
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:54,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had people in the community come up to me and say, you know, in this day and age, do we really need a new library?

407
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:07,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I tell people is that this is not the library that we all remember, where you go pull out old microfilm and sit down and maybe rent a video or so forth or a book.

408
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:11,629
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be a state-of-the-art community gathering space.

409
00:31:12,387 --> 00:31:24,194
[SPEAKER_10]: um, and equip with the latest in technology and someplace that, uh, you want to say, Hey, I'm going to go down to the square to go to the library and, uh, it'll become a destination place.

410
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:28,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am so ecstatic to see, uh, the plans, uh, moving forward.

411
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:39,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I know the, uh, friends of the library been working, uh, with this building, uh, for a number of years and the new library building committee has done yeoman's work.

412
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:43,954
[SPEAKER_10]: and gathering the information needed and such a short period of time.

413
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:55,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the question I do have is that, uh, I don't want to be a Debbie downer, but if the grant does not come through for some reason, do we have a plan B in place?

414
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:58,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, because, um, I want to see something happen.

415
00:31:58,964 --> 00:31:59,704
[SPEAKER_10]: This is great.

416
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see this happen.

417
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:07,709
[SPEAKER_10]: But if this, for whatever reason doesn't come to fruition, I think we need to have a plan B and start moving on that plan B.

418
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:10,333
[SPEAKER_10]: immediately, so has there been any discussion?

419
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Not between, well, in my head, yes.

420
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:21,359
[SPEAKER_14]: I figured the first thing we would do would be to speak to Bloomberg Philanthropies and see if they would be willing to proceed, even if we didn't get a grant.

421
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:22,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

422
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:25,502
[SPEAKER_14]: We can try a capital campaign.

423
00:32:25,582 --> 00:32:36,948
[SPEAKER_14]: I suspect what we will end up doing is raising some money to do an interim renovation so that we can use the second floor, and then when the grant round comes around in the next 10 years, then we would apply again.

424
00:32:38,198 --> 00:32:38,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

425
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, now you mentioned, I think council Longo current asked about the construction timeframe.

426
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:50,065
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the total construction from, uh, putting a shovel into the ground until we actually do a ribbon cutting?

427
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:55,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we're estimating, um, uh, let's see.

428
00:32:56,088 --> 00:32:59,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the exact number of months.

429
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say around 16 months.

430
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:05,723
[SPEAKER_09]: 16 now that that is a plus or minus.

431
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:10,423
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would be part of a negotiation with a, with a contractor.

432
00:33:10,463 --> 00:33:21,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and as we get a little bit more detailed in the design, we would be able to pin that down a little bit more and put that into the project bidding documents that this is our construction schedule.

433
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:30,927
[SPEAKER_10]: So as part of the plans, what is going to be done to temporarily relocate the library for possibly almost a two year span?

434
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,260
[SPEAKER_14]: What you usually do is you take a proportion of your collection with you.

435
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,861
[SPEAKER_14]: It would depend on what available space is available at the time that we need to move out.

436
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:45,881
[SPEAKER_14]: I've known people who've been in a school auditorium for a couple of years.

437
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:50,302
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd have to find a storefront or an empty building and relocate for that time.

438
00:33:50,342 --> 00:33:53,123
[SPEAKER_10]: So has there been any consideration of potential sites?

439
00:33:54,403 --> 00:34:01,344
[SPEAKER_14]: I have some ideas, but it's all going to depend on when we know when we're moving out and what's available at that time.

440
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:07,009
[SPEAKER_14]: I personally think Springstep would be a great place to land for a couple of years, but it may not be available at the time.

441
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:15,054
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's something we're going to have to look at when we're a little closer to knowing when we are actually going to have to move out.

442
00:34:16,035 --> 00:34:16,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

443
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:21,519
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Magoon Room has a number of historical artifacts.

444
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:30,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any discussion on using some of the Amelia Hart artifacts that are in there to enhance the library and enhance some of

445
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:32,264
[SPEAKER_10]: the educational tools that we might have.

446
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:39,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything we have has been written into the mate, the basic building program and they're not designed there.

447
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,871
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't designed spaces with them, but we do.

448
00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:44,294
[SPEAKER_14]: We're very aware of them when we're going to move them with us.

449
00:34:44,594 --> 00:34:57,785
[SPEAKER_14]: And the, in the children's department, there are these carved, uh, sculptural bookshelves and things that were part of the Bloomberg donation when, um, mayor Bloomberg's mother died and those are going to be worked into the children's,

450
00:34:58,385 --> 00:35:01,307
[SPEAKER_14]: scheme in the new building, but we will bring the guy.

451
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:02,408
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll bring everybody with us.

452
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:03,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely.

453
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:09,614
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, we have a, there is a local history room, a dedicated local history room on the first floor in these plans.

454
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:15,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, we'll, we'll be able to locate the, the air heart, um, cabinet and display and all that.

455
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:16,879
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

456
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:27,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost in the same theme that you have now, when you walk into the library, you have the display cases where you have stuff similar to that, where, uh, we may be able to turn a section of the library into,

457
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:31,453
[SPEAKER_10]: come and display your old political buttons like you had in there at one point.

458
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:38,176
[SPEAKER_14]: We will find spaces and then there'll be an art gallery on the second floor so we can hang larger things there.

459
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:39,657
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, that's great.

460
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:40,237
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

461
00:35:40,818 --> 00:35:52,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so just, just the, uh, the last point I have, um, regarding, uh, is, uh, there any stipulation regarding the city's,

462
00:35:53,499 --> 00:36:03,030
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, budgetary requirements, uh, in regards to, as you know, I don't have to tell you, Barbara, that, uh, over the last several years, the city has underfunded, uh, the library.

463
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:13,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and, uh, is there any requirements when we apply for the grant that we have to maintain that funding at a level so that that is written into the grant document itself?

464
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:14,643
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe.

465
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:17,668
[SPEAKER_14]: You all have this, it says it in there somewhere.

466
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:25,970
[SPEAKER_14]: You have during the construction period state aid, the compliance levels have to be maintained.

467
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:33,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And the fact that we are now at our levels and have been maintained for several years is a very good, we wouldn't be able to apply if they weren't.

468
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:36,894
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is somewhere in here it is written in that they have to be.

469
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,141
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's not in this one, it's in this library.

470
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:42,802
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe you.

471
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:43,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

472
00:36:43,582 --> 00:36:43,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

473
00:36:43,942 --> 00:36:44,342
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

474
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:47,064
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, and I liked the suggestion.

475
00:36:47,084 --> 00:36:51,926
[SPEAKER_10]: I realized there's no funding within the grant for the exterior landscaping.

476
00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:52,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

477
00:36:52,827 --> 00:37:03,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, uh, that council Scott Pelly brought up about having interactive, um, uh, similar to what we're doing out here at the, uh, on Salem street.

478
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:04,833
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

479
00:37:04,853 --> 00:37:08,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Riverside F as you probably know, we're doing the bus shelter over,

480
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:12,125
[SPEAKER_10]: and that particular area to turn it into an outdoor gathering space.

481
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:19,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to have a number of interactive exhibits for young and middle-aged children.

482
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:22,313
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd love to see something around the library.

483
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:25,235
[SPEAKER_10]: They do a great project in South Boston.

484
00:37:25,255 --> 00:37:26,596
[SPEAKER_10]: My kids just went recently.

485
00:37:27,076 --> 00:37:29,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have these lit up, I can never remember the name of it.

486
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,099
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone knows, if you could help me out.

487
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,901
[SPEAKER_10]: They have these great lit up things that you can sit in.

488
00:37:35,442 --> 00:37:36,543
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a big attraction.

489
00:37:36,983 --> 00:37:38,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the Lawn on D?

490
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:44,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Lawn on D. Lawn on D. And let me tell you, it's a great attraction.

491
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:56,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure what the cost is, but kids go from all over, all over to go there and be pictured with these outdoor seating, illuminated structures.

492
00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:06,557
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's really just, you know, an excellent take and something that would serve as an attraction, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned.

493
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:14,252
[SPEAKER_10]: and maybe something outside where we received a grant for the Riverside Ave, $250,000 for this project.

494
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:18,954
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be something that we can look at for the exterior of the library.

495
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:22,536
[SPEAKER_10]: But Barbara, I want to thank you in your short term as the director.

496
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:24,257
[SPEAKER_10]: We seem to be on the move.

497
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:26,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Very much so.

498
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Faster than I intended to go.

499
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it takes leadership.

500
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:35,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to thank you for your leadership and the board of the library and also the building

501
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:43,158
[SPEAKER_10]: committee as well as Councilor Caviello, I think it was about a year and a half ago, you mentioned about doing the library over and looking for grants.

502
00:38:43,798 --> 00:38:49,419
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think everyone looked at you like you had three heads and now we're looking at him as he has one giant head.

503
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,840
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean that in a good way.

504
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,900
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean that in a good way.

505
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of brains in it.

506
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,641
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I want to thank Councilor Caviello for his leadership on that too.

507
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:01,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

508
00:39:02,462 --> 00:39:03,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

509
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

510
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:05,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

511
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we are.

512
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:11,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

513
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you just comment really quick, if you don't mind, on the green incentive?

514
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:29,848
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember, I think you had mentioned it at the meeting that night, but just so everyone knows, if you could just talk a little bit about it, because I believe it does, there's an incentive to go in green, and I believe there's more grant funding that we can acquire if we do go green.

515
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:31,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want Alicia?

516
00:39:31,844 --> 00:39:34,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we borrow Alicia?

517
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:45,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just answer generally, and you can supplement if you need to.

518
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:57,522
[SPEAKER_09]: There are not only moral reasons to design a green building, like helping the environment, but there's also financial reasons, too.

519
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:07,185
[SPEAKER_09]: lower energy costs, there's also health reasons, better environment for people that live or work and spend time in the library.

520
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:15,871
[SPEAKER_09]: And for that reason, we normally design buildings that meet, that would be able to get LEED certified.

521
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:20,154
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just kind of in the bones of making good architecture.

522
00:40:21,675 --> 00:40:23,637
[SPEAKER_09]: The Mass Board of Library Commissioners,

523
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:33,167
[SPEAKER_09]: incentivizes actually getting certified as a lead project by giving some additional grant money.

524
00:40:34,627 --> 00:40:38,548
[SPEAKER_09]: We usually assume around 2% of the eligible project costs.

525
00:40:39,868 --> 00:40:49,150
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's doing things that we would probably normally suggest are done anyway, like using low VOC materials.

526
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:55,485
[SPEAKER_09]: super efficient energy equipment, HVAC equipment, et cetera.

527
00:40:56,305 --> 00:41:00,688
[SPEAKER_09]: But by actually pursuing the grant, you get reimbursed for all those good decisions.

528
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:05,351
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I'm correct, are we aiming for silver, the silver level?

529
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:18,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think we have done a preliminary lead checklist where you kind of go through all the criteria and you kind of guesstimate, you know, these are in the bag, these are question marks, these are kind of probably not achievable.

530
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:22,980
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks like silver is definitely achievable.

531
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,681
[SPEAKER_09]: We kind of land squarely in the mid range of silver.

532
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:32,264
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, that would be, um, that would be a, a good target in an additional 2.5%.

533
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,125
[SPEAKER_11]: So it just, that helps.

534
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:34,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

535
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:35,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

536
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:35,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

537
00:41:36,346 --> 00:41:36,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

538
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:39,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

539
00:41:39,448 --> 00:41:43,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Falco on the motion for approval by council and I'd second by council.

540
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Carve yellow chair recognizes counselor night.

541
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:47,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yes, Mr. President.

542
00:41:47,752 --> 00:41:48,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, um,

543
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if they have a green incentive.

544
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:57,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other incentives that are available for us to pursue to receive increased grant reimbursement or increased priority in receiving the grant?

545
00:41:58,327 --> 00:41:59,868
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing built into this.

546
00:41:59,888 --> 00:42:06,833
[SPEAKER_14]: There is the, you know, the EQV, the need parameter that is assigned to different communities.

547
00:42:07,473 --> 00:42:13,878
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a 7.91 percentage and that is actually added to our grant amount.

548
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:20,943
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have an additional 7% worth of money, but the green, the incentive is the only other thing that they've got built in.

549
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:21,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

550
00:42:21,183 --> 00:42:21,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

551
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:22,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate the work.

552
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:22,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job guys.

553
00:42:22,964 --> 00:42:23,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

554
00:42:23,344 --> 00:42:27,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a citizen that would like to speak and we want to hear from, uh,

555
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:38,183
[SPEAKER_06]: the venerable city solicitor regarding a slight paragraph change of language in the grant application request.

556
00:42:38,563 --> 00:42:40,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes the city solicitor.

557
00:42:41,745 --> 00:42:42,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Mr. President.

558
00:42:42,845 --> 00:42:44,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Rumley, city solicitor.

559
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:46,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

560
00:42:47,027 --> 00:42:49,668
[SPEAKER_01]: My input into all this has been very mechanical.

561
00:42:49,688 --> 00:42:55,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working with Barbara to help certain aspects of the grant and the documentation that's necessary.

562
00:42:55,938 --> 00:43:00,901
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also commend Barbara and her committee for the work that they've done into this design.

563
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:08,926
[SPEAKER_01]: But along the lines of the mechanical work I have to do, and I mean that in a legal sense, in the resolution that you have right now, there's a paragraph one.

564
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:20,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Barbara and I spoke through Barbara to the library commissioners today and yesterday, and there's a small change in paragraph one that's necessary.

565
00:43:21,513 --> 00:43:25,035
[SPEAKER_01]: The paragraph should be changed to, and I have this written out for the clerk,

566
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:47,350
[SPEAKER_01]: The paragraph should be changed to read, apply, accept, and expend state grant funds subject to appropriation by the city of Medford in connection with a state construction grant offered by the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, then semicolon and the word and.

567
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:49,191
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have this to be distributed.

568
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:53,272
[SPEAKER_01]: The resolution should be amended to include this paragraph number one.

569
00:43:54,913 --> 00:43:55,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I'll read it again.

570
00:43:56,373 --> 00:44:15,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Apply, accept, and expend state grant funds, comma, subject to appropriation by the city of Medford, comma, in connection with a state construction grant offered by the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners, semi-colon, and, and then you go into number two.

571
00:44:16,397 --> 00:44:18,837
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have it typed out for you, so you don't have to write it out.

572
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:21,758
[SPEAKER_01]: If the messenger would distribute those,

573
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:33,031
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the language, this is the language that has been approved by the state library committee commissioners, which would make this grant, uh, well, it would get it into the starting gate.

574
00:44:33,312 --> 00:44:34,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what we're doing tonight.

575
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:40,277
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting it into the starting gate and then they'll open the gates and every horse will take off and we'll see what happens.

576
00:44:42,699 --> 00:44:43,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam vice president.

577
00:44:44,321 --> 00:44:44,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

578
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:45,802
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm solicitor Emily.

579
00:44:45,842 --> 00:44:50,966
[SPEAKER_13]: So will this come back to the council for any additional vote or are we, are you,

580
00:44:51,752 --> 00:44:53,253
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that is that language.

581
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:57,695
[SPEAKER_01]: A good part of its standard, what they've asked for.

582
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:04,739
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would come back because the grant would only be part of the dollars necessary to go through this construction.

583
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,461
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would always be subject to additional appropriation by this council.

584
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:10,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it would be a significant amount of money.

585
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:13,243
[SPEAKER_01]: That would always be the case.

586
00:45:13,263 --> 00:45:15,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the grant would not cover 100% of the construction cost.

587
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:20,763
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have to come before the council because you'd need a hundred percent and then, cause then you'd be reimbursed.

588
00:45:20,863 --> 00:45:21,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

589
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:31,787
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully when we get involved in the, in this grant process, if it's successful, as Barbara has, has described, it may be in the first level, might be in the second, uh, God willing.

590
00:45:32,207 --> 00:45:39,170
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it is, then we would have to make an appropriation in order to supplement the funds so that recon, uh, new construction could begin.

591
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

592
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:40,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

593
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:41,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

594
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:42,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

595
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:45,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, madam vice president, uh, chair recognizes citizen,

596
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:47,050
[SPEAKER_06]: at the podium.

597
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:51,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso, Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Medford Mass.

598
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:55,435
[SPEAKER_00]: I also commend all the people involved that want to better the city.

599
00:45:56,776 --> 00:46:04,680
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, I've said it numerous times, if you need something, the city needs it, but they should do it.

600
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:12,684
[SPEAKER_00]: My only concern is these buildings are not that old, such as the police station, the library.

601
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:16,246
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, they're younger than I am.

602
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:22,533
[SPEAKER_00]: and it doesn't seem right that they're in such disrepair that they have to be replaced.

603
00:46:25,055 --> 00:46:34,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Saying that, we have over probably 10,000 houses in this city that are made of wood frame, and they seem to be in fine standing order.

604
00:46:35,463 --> 00:46:43,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Chevrolet Auditorium, I believe, was built in 1939, according to Dee, and I think Method High School on Forest Street, the old one, I believe, was built in the 1800s.

605
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:59,573
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to me we have a problem with maintenance and I just don't want to see us spend millions and down the road our children are going to be saddled in another 50 years with billion dollar buildings.

606
00:47:01,114 --> 00:47:02,215
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my only concern.

607
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:03,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

608
00:47:03,355 --> 00:47:03,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

609
00:47:03,776 --> 00:47:06,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Citizen chair recognizes councilor night.

610
00:47:07,478 --> 00:47:13,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President motion to adopt the amendment as proposed by city solicitor motion.

611
00:47:15,932 --> 00:47:16,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

612
00:47:17,413 --> 00:47:30,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Just if we could, cause Mr. Cassidy brings up a great point and maybe if Barbara can answer it as part of the grant proposal, does the city have to clearly define what its maintenance will be of the building?

613
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,386
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a question about stewardship.

614
00:47:33,407 --> 00:47:38,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, they wanted a statement saying how you were planning to maintain.

615
00:47:38,271 --> 00:47:43,015
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wrote that it would be included in the annual budget maintenance of the building.

616
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,121
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so that is part of the grant proposal.

617
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:46,942
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of the questions.

618
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:48,243
[SPEAKER_10]: It is one of the questions.

619
00:47:48,283 --> 00:48:00,191
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and I agree with Mr Castaneda that there's been a lack of oversight for many years, but we have to move on forward now and that shouldn't prevent us from creating these great new structures for our residents.

620
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,432
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, thank you.

621
00:48:03,293 --> 00:48:03,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

622
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:05,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Barbara.

623
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very, very much for your leadership in this matter.

641
00:49:36,326 --> 00:49:37,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's the chair of that paper?

642
00:49:38,363 --> 00:49:39,523
[SPEAKER_06]: That is me.

643
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:42,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor, can you tell us a little bit about it to refresh our memories?

644
00:49:42,864 --> 00:49:43,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

645
00:49:43,365 --> 00:49:45,145
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems a little restrictive to my eye.

646
00:49:45,685 --> 00:49:53,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, the Medford historical district commission came before the Medford city council's subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.

647
00:49:53,988 --> 00:50:01,910
[SPEAKER_02]: They have constructed a proposal to amend the current language of the Medford city ordinances that deal with demolition delay.

648
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:08,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the subcommittee met in the presentation was put on by the historical district commission and his chairman, Ryan Haywood,

649
00:50:08,652 --> 00:50:14,715
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, members of the commission were in attendance, including, uh, miss Morris, I believe, who just walked out the door here, who was here for the library.

650
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:18,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, ultimately, Mr. President, this was a number of changes were being made.

651
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:26,581
[SPEAKER_02]: The subcommittee voted to send the proposal to the city solicitor, the office of community development and the building commissioners for recommendations and input.

652
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:31,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, prior to reporting the paper out of, uh, prior to reporting the paper to the committee of the whole.

653
00:50:31,383 --> 00:50:38,186
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were asking that the council adopt this committee report so that we could ask the questions, get that answer back and then provide you with more information at a later date.

654
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:41,113
[SPEAKER_06]: That is very helpful, Councillor, as an explanation.

655
00:50:41,294 --> 00:50:43,636
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

656
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:44,016

[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it.

00:50:49,561 --> 00:50:50,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, a motion to suspend the rules.

661
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:54,286
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be sent out to the appropriate people for input.

662
00:50:54,726 --> 00:50:58,630
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councillor Knight for suspension of the rules, all those in favor?

663

[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed, motion granted.

664
00:51:00,855 --> 00:51:02,715
[SPEAKER_06]: For what reason are we in the suspension?

665
00:51:02,775 --> 00:51:11,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, Mr. President, the community preservation act ordinance to develop the community preservation committee has reached its eligibility for third reading.

666
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:20,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd ask that paper one six, seven, six, six be taken off the table for its third reading this evening on the motion that we take 16 dash seven 66 off the table.

667
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,241
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor.

[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed before us for a third reading chair weights motion.

669
00:51:34,723 --> 00:51:41,586
[SPEAKER_06]: We have before us 16-766 Community Preservation Act Ordinance for a third reading.

670
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:44,748
[SPEAKER_06]: The Chair is awaiting a motion to act on this.

671
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:45,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Move approval, Mr. President.

672
00:51:45,508 --> 00:51:46,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't sound like it's too controversial.

673
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:49,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

674

[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

677
00:51:53,512 --> 00:51:55,974
[SPEAKER_06]: The Council President stands corrected.

678
00:51:56,374 --> 00:51:58,495
[SPEAKER_06]: That was seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

679
00:51:59,037 --> 00:52:04,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, indicate Councilor Scott Pelley gets credit for the seconding of the motion.

[SPEAKER_04]: President Del Rosso?

694
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:19,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

695
00:52:19,901 --> 00:52:22,082
[SPEAKER_06]: With the vote of seven, the affirmative, none of the negative.

696
00:52:22,962 --> 00:52:24,622
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion is ordained.

697
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:28,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor, while we're under suspension, I think the vice-president was,

698
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,881
[SPEAKER_06]: getting my attention first, madam.

699
00:52:31,822 --> 00:52:32,122
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll yield.

700
00:52:32,142 --> 00:52:37,426
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to do the condolences, but, uh, council max, we have a resident here that would like to speak.

701
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:41,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President with the resident here, uh, the unnamed resident come up to speak to us.

702
00:52:44,012 --> 00:52:45,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Tidings of joy.

703
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:45,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

704
00:52:45,873 --> 00:52:47,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

705
00:52:47,715 --> 00:52:51,738
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Robert Penta zero summit road, Medford mass, former member of this body.

706
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:57,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I was sitting on this side of the rail tonight, I'd be making the same proposal that I want to say to it this evening.

707
00:52:57,836 --> 00:53:03,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been following this story now for a few days, and it's been evident over the last three days in the Boston Herald.

708
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,721
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a story regarding a young man.

709
00:53:05,761 --> 00:53:07,101
[SPEAKER_08]: His name is DJ Simons.

710
00:53:08,202 --> 00:53:10,844
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a Boston police officer, 28 years old.

711
00:53:11,684 --> 00:53:12,745
[SPEAKER_08]: He is the unsung hero.

712
00:53:12,825 --> 00:53:16,087
[SPEAKER_08]: He is the forgotten man in the Boston Marathon story.

713
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:26,673
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I would like to propose and ask you as Medford City Councilors to do on behalf of our city, knowing that we have that great monument out there for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden,

714
00:53:27,313 --> 00:53:33,355
[SPEAKER_08]: that represents our city, who recognizes in times of tragedy, we do stand to the occasion.

715
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:38,277
[SPEAKER_08]: We put our political principles aside, and we do unify amongst ourselves.

716
00:53:39,097 --> 00:53:47,500
[SPEAKER_08]: This gentleman, 28 years old, was hit by a bomb, pipe bomb, four days after the incident that took place at the Boston Marathon.

717
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,741
[SPEAKER_08]: He was one of the first officers on the scene.

718
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:52,402
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result of that, he received a head injury.

719
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:54,722
[SPEAKER_08]: And he died subsequently one year later.

720
00:53:55,543 --> 00:53:56,603
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result of that,

721
00:53:57,553 --> 00:54:04,836
[SPEAKER_08]: His mother, Roxanne Simons, and father, who lived down in the Cape, were never notified of this story called Patriots Day.

722
00:54:05,916 --> 00:54:11,238
[SPEAKER_08]: They called up the producers, Peter Berg, Mark Wahlberg, and they have yet to receive a response.

723
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:17,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Fellow Boston police officers are aware of what took place.

724
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:20,542
[SPEAKER_08]: A state representative up on Beacon Hill named Tim Whelan

725
00:54:22,032 --> 00:54:33,754
[SPEAKER_08]: made an application to the, um, the board of the directors and the film director, uh, for, uh, Patriot's day and asked them if they would consider doing a post script somehow of putting it in there.

726
00:54:34,455 --> 00:54:35,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Never got a response back.

727
00:54:36,675 --> 00:54:48,477
[SPEAKER_08]: The part that was hurting and disturbing according to Mrs. Simons is the fact that when they can't at the end of the movie, the postscripts of the movie had the four pitches and the four names of the folks that we have in our peace garden.

728
00:54:48,998 --> 00:54:51,338
[SPEAKER_08]: But Mr. Simon's name was, was not there.

729
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,262
[SPEAKER_08]: This gentleman is 28 years old.

730
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:54,463
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a college graduate.

731
00:54:55,143 --> 00:54:59,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And subsequently, on graduating college, he went to the Boston Police School to become a Boston police officer.

732
00:55:00,424 --> 00:55:02,164
[SPEAKER_08]: He was originally stationed in Brighton, Mass.

733
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:06,765
[SPEAKER_08]: But he was more of wanting to be not a Boston police officer who hands out tickets.

734
00:55:07,145 --> 00:55:10,406
[SPEAKER_08]: He wanted to get into the inner city youth, and that's where he did.

735
00:55:10,546 --> 00:55:14,107
[SPEAKER_08]: He went into the inner city youth where the problems were, and he loved it.

736
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:19,088
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a good police officer, loved by many policemen, and loved by his community.

737
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:29,441
[SPEAKER_08]: He unfortunately has not even received any kind of recognition throughout this whole program called Patriot's Day, which is a great movie if you want to look at it like that.

738
00:55:29,561 --> 00:55:33,384
[SPEAKER_08]: And as they do say, sometimes there are some errors and there's some slips to get through.

739
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:45,553
[SPEAKER_08]: But they were notified well in advance, and they're still notified as of now, that maybe to have him recognized as being an unsung hero who died, unfortunately, one year after the tragedy.

740
00:55:45,573 --> 00:55:47,755
[SPEAKER_08]: He was one of the first people, one of the first people

741
00:55:48,175 --> 00:55:51,497
[SPEAKER_08]: of Boston police responders to Watertown Mass on the night of that incident.

742
00:55:53,017 --> 00:56:04,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, all my council colleagues, you folks do many resolutions for many people, whether they are for sports, whether they are for someone who might have passed away, whatever it might be.

743
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:14,648
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the family of this police officer, I think it would be outstanding that this Medford City Council recognizes the fact that this gentleman, DJ Simons,

744
00:56:15,402 --> 00:56:20,263
[SPEAKER_08]: who didn't get recognized, is recognized by the city of Medford, its city government.

745
00:56:21,123 --> 00:56:22,504
[SPEAKER_08]: For the gentleman did give his life.

746
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:24,924
[SPEAKER_08]: He did respond and he was there.

747
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:30,245
[SPEAKER_08]: And for his parents not to have any recognition to that at all, it's just not right.

748
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:31,926
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think it's fair.

749
00:56:32,706 --> 00:56:45,209
[SPEAKER_08]: So I ask of you, seven of you collectively, for one of you to offer the resolution, or if jointly, to send a note of condolences and of appreciation and of thanks to the Simons family, thanking them for their sons.

750
00:56:45,776 --> 00:56:48,658
[SPEAKER_08]: efforts as a result of the Boston Marathon.

751
00:56:49,018 --> 00:57:07,492
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe there is something, somehow, some way, a plaque of postscript can find its way to that Peace Garden as well here in the city of Medford to let the entire world, to let the entire people know and to let the Simons family know that the city of Medford will not forget and they're most appreciative of what their son did.

752
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:11,735
[SPEAKER_08]: So I offer, I ask one of you to come forward and do that.

753
00:57:11,815 --> 00:57:15,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston, as of today's paper,

754
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:27,049
[SPEAKER_08]: has he himself has taken it upon himself to seek out through the producers and the directors of that show who have refused, I shouldn't say refused, who have yet to respond back to him to have him included.

755
00:57:27,709 --> 00:57:29,850
[SPEAKER_08]: What the reason is, nobody knows.

756
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:44,738
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a known fact, it is a known fact that that gentleman died in the line of duty protecting the citizens, doing his job as a police officer in behalf of the citizens of this commonwealth and the citizens of Boston and for the people who participated in that Boston Marathon.

757
00:57:49,888 --> 00:57:51,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we should offer it as a council.

758
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:53,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Mr. President.

759
00:57:53,371 --> 00:58:10,944
[SPEAKER_06]: A motion from Councilman Marks that a letter of condolence be sent to the aforementioned police officer's family in recognition of his dedicated service and sacrifice and his being a victim of hatred state law.

760
00:58:11,985 --> 00:58:21,080
[SPEAKER_06]: and that the city of Medford shall make an effort to recognize him in the memorial that exists on the city grounds.

761
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:24,446
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion, seconded by the Vice President of the Mayor and all those in favor.

762
00:58:24,486 --> 00:58:25,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote.

763
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,037
[SPEAKER_06]: expansion.

764
00:58:56,057 --> 00:59:02,299
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a couple, uh, we're going to take a couple, uh, page gentlemen.

765
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:06,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to thank, uh, council Penta for bringing this to our attention.

766
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I did see something in the news recently, uh, regarding Mr, uh, Simons.

767
00:59:12,741 --> 00:59:21,103
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, I think the, um, uh, movie producers did put out a statement saying at the end,

768
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:32,278
[SPEAKER_10]: They thanked all who were involved and who had some type of involvement or hardship with the Marathon bombing.

769
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,280
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was the way they presented it as covering everyone.

770
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,761
[SPEAKER_10]: So, but I want to thank Councilor Penta, Mr. President, for bringing this up.

771
00:59:40,781 --> 00:59:41,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

772
00:59:41,381 --> 00:59:43,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

773
00:59:43,182 --> 00:59:44,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Papers under suspension.

774
00:59:44,402 --> 00:59:47,863
[SPEAKER_06]: 16-814 offered by Councilor Caviello.

775
00:59:48,383 --> 00:59:50,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council

776
00:59:50,675 --> 00:59:54,476
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, send condolences to the family of Joseph Bettinelli on his recent passing.

777
00:59:54,516 --> 01:00:04,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Bettinelli was a teacher in Medford schools, science teacher at the Lincoln junior high school and served our country in World War II in the United States Navy.

778
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:07,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Bettinelli's presence will be missed by all.

779
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:19,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, offered by Councilor Caviello, 16-813 offered, uh, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its, uh, sincere condolences to the family of Jean Barry Sutherland on a recent passing.

780
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:25,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Jean was an educator to the children of Medford for many years, and always had a smile and hello for everyone.

781
01:00:26,134 --> 01:00:28,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Her presence in our community will be sorely missed.

782
01:00:30,515 --> 01:00:30,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Please join us.

783
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:31,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you want to speak?

784
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:32,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Mr. President.

785
01:00:33,015 --> 01:00:33,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Quick thing.

786
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:37,236
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I had Mr. Bettinelli in the Lincoln Junior High School as a teacher.

787
01:00:38,197 --> 01:00:39,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Good guy, nice, good guy.

788
01:00:39,997 --> 01:00:46,479
[SPEAKER_15]: I know he's moved out, but he was a World War II veteran in the Navy, and he did serve our country there, too.

789
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:53,164
[SPEAKER_15]: And as far as Jean Barry Sutherland goes, I've been friendly with the Barry family for many, many years.

790
01:00:53,264 --> 01:00:57,267
[SPEAKER_15]: And Jean was one of those special people.

791
01:00:57,868 --> 01:01:01,891
[SPEAKER_15]: You'd always see her and her sister walking all over the city of Medford, always with a smile.

792
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:06,834
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, she's one of those people that always brought joy to everyone.

793
01:01:06,874 --> 01:01:09,176
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, she'll be sorely missed in our community.

794
01:01:09,815 --> 01:01:10,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

795
01:01:10,635 --> 01:01:11,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Max?

796
01:01:12,176 --> 01:01:16,338
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mr. President, too, I'd be remiss if I didn't say something about Jean Barry Sutherland.

797
01:01:17,618 --> 01:01:24,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I have known Jean for a number of years, and she was truly a dedicated professional in our Meffitt Public Schools.

798
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:28,823
[SPEAKER_10]: She was well-liked by everyone, as Councilor Caviello mentioned.

799
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:39,308
[SPEAKER_10]: She always had a smile on her face, even when she was going through very trying times over the last many years, she was there to give a positive note and positive advice.

800
01:01:40,004 --> 01:01:42,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, she will solely be missed in this community.

801
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:44,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, please join us in a moment of silence.

802
01:01:59,478 --> 01:02:06,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by council Caviello, be it resolved that the Medford city council commend and congratulate the jingle bell, uh, committee,

803
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:11,952
[SPEAKER_06]: for another successful Jingle Bell Festival all the way.

804
01:02:12,412 --> 01:02:13,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

805
01:02:13,352 --> 01:02:22,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, again, I think every year when people come in and see the trees here, I don't think a lot of people know what the actual meaning of them are.

806
01:02:23,435 --> 01:02:29,717
[SPEAKER_15]: And over the last 17 years, the Jingle Bell Committee has raised over $350,000 for the Buddy Caholden Center.

807
01:02:30,478 --> 01:02:32,298
[SPEAKER_15]: And the Buddy Caholden Center is a center that

808
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:38,133
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a daycare center for people with Alzheimer's and dementia.

809
01:02:38,853 --> 01:02:46,975
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a horrible disease for someone to have in their family, unless you have it, unless you know somebody, you have something to be involved with.

810
01:02:49,195 --> 01:02:51,156
[SPEAKER_15]: People just don't know how devastating it is.

811
01:02:51,516 --> 01:02:56,637
[SPEAKER_15]: And this year, the Jingle Bell Committee raised over $20,000 again this year.

812
01:02:57,258 --> 01:03:03,079
[SPEAKER_15]: And every year they say that their commitment to the Buddy Cahalan Center has been great.

813
01:03:03,603 --> 01:03:06,025
[SPEAKER_15]: And they bought vans, they did the kitchen over.

814
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:09,007
[SPEAKER_15]: So the money isn't just used for that, but been used for many things.

815
01:03:09,047 --> 01:03:17,373
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanna thank the committee, those women, they do yeoman's work for that small weekend of time.

816
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,635
[SPEAKER_15]: And the trees, they look great again.

817
01:03:19,655 --> 01:03:21,076
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanna thank them again for their work.

818
01:03:21,796 --> 01:03:22,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

819
01:03:22,617 --> 01:03:23,958
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion, all those in favor?

820
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:25,119
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

821
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:27,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carries, offered by Councilor Caviello.

822
01:03:27,481 --> 01:03:30,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the DPW,

823
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:34,533
[SPEAKER_06]: make the necessary repairs to the potholders on Swan Street.

824
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:35,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor.

825
01:03:35,273 --> 01:03:35,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

826
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:46,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I don't know if many people know, but Swan Street is a major carrier of oil trucks that go get filled up down at Dunman Fuel.

827
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:50,706
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's some pretty serious holes there that should be repaired.

828
01:03:50,746 --> 01:03:58,372
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's only a matter of time before a truck breaks an axle and punctures their tank.

829
01:03:59,032 --> 01:04:01,133
[SPEAKER_15]: and we have a serious spill in our community.

830
01:04:01,553 --> 01:04:08,056
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would ask that the DPW go down and do what they can to fix that street.

831
01:04:08,517 --> 01:04:19,202
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought that was gonna be fixed as part of when the DPW building was built at Swan Street and James Street, but I see that they're not fixed.

832
01:04:19,242 --> 01:04:28,026
[SPEAKER_15]: But Swan Street is in disrepair, and I said that there's an awful lot of oil trucks that go down that street because they fill up with Dunavant fuel,

833
01:04:28,714 --> 01:04:33,058
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, I would, I would hate to see a spill, uh, with contamination in our community.

834
01:04:33,098 --> 01:04:37,061
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion for approval by council Caviello, the citizen wishes to speak at the podium.

835
01:04:37,401 --> 01:04:39,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

836
01:04:39,463 --> 01:04:40,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Robert Pence is zero summit road.

837
01:04:40,724 --> 01:04:41,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Method mast.

838
01:04:41,445 --> 01:04:43,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, just to jump onto what council Caviello has alluded to.

839
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:50,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you at a gentleman up here about six months ago complaining about he drove down the street, not only did he break his spring, but it was a full tank of gas.

840
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:52,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, oil, God forbid that that oil didn't go.

841
01:04:53,275 --> 01:04:54,716
[SPEAKER_08]: The city has now been put on notice.

842
01:04:54,736 --> 01:04:55,677
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the second time.

843
01:04:56,266 --> 01:04:57,546
[SPEAKER_08]: You're doing streets all over there.

844
01:04:57,566 --> 01:05:00,587
[SPEAKER_08]: You just got through doing Governor's Avenue from top to bottom on one side.

845
01:05:00,627 --> 01:05:02,148
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been doing other streets in the city.

846
01:05:02,688 --> 01:05:06,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Here is a commercial street that is just begging for an accident to happen.

847
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:09,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, it's probably going to cause the city a major lawsuit.

848
01:05:10,371 --> 01:05:15,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So as Councilor Caviello has alluded to, I think it's something that needs to take place immediately before an accident does happen.

849
01:05:15,872 --> 01:05:18,473
[SPEAKER_08]: And if that does happen, then you'd have OSHA and everybody else down here.

850
01:05:18,553 --> 01:05:20,994
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, once informed, shame on you.

851
01:05:21,054 --> 01:05:23,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Twice informed, look out because that's a lawsuit waiting to happen.

852
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:26,449
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think you'd really wanna have something like that right now.

853
01:05:26,949 --> 01:05:28,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

854
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:29,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Merry Christmas on the motion for approval.

855
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:30,970
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

856
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:32,030
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

857
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:32,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carries.

858
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:37,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we wanna clean everything off the agendas here, citizen?

859
01:05:37,412 --> 01:05:39,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

860
01:05:40,113 --> 01:05:41,433
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you wish to address us on?

861
01:05:42,853 --> 01:05:43,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Season's greetings.

862
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:44,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

863
01:05:44,894 --> 01:05:51,716
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I'd be remiss after receiving some information finally from the assessor's office not to

864
01:05:52,526 --> 01:06:03,131
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned this calculation that I did on my own time, hopefully would benefit the middle class real estate taxpayer in the future.

865
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:05,712
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make it very brief.

866
01:06:06,752 --> 01:06:20,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I received all the information pertaining to last week's real estate tax rate meeting, and I did a fair sample calculation to compare what the average real estate tax bill for the year would be.

867
01:06:21,183 --> 01:06:33,072
[SPEAKER_00]: if we had adopted the 20% owner occupied real estate tax exemption based on the average home value here in 02155, which is 485,000 times $10 and 50 something cents would be 5,122.

868
01:06:33,112 --> 01:06:39,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the 20% exemption, the 485, you would take away 20% of the value, which is 97,000.

869
01:06:50,563 --> 01:07:01,008
[SPEAKER_00]: You have therefore a sum of 388,000 times, much higher rate from 1050 to 1240s, but it's 4,800 and change.

870
01:07:01,869 --> 01:07:12,034
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line is the average home of a home that lives in it would save $307 a year if the 20% exemption was adopted.

871
01:07:12,994 --> 01:07:17,536
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, the average single family will be building extra $280 increase next year.

872
01:07:20,635 --> 01:07:31,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore also 11,000 out of the 12,000 owner occupied homeowners who actually live in their house will miss out on this huge real estate savings.

873
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:43,695
[SPEAKER_00]: If we only had adopted the Commonwealth of Massachusetts general law chapter 59 section five C which offers us middle class real estate tax relief.

874
01:07:47,078 --> 01:07:47,418
[SPEAKER_00]: This 300 to

875
01:07:48,883 --> 01:07:56,004
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly $600 real estate tax savings for the average homeowner would have been a nice Christmas gift for the first time ever.

876
01:07:57,905 --> 01:08:02,645
[SPEAKER_00]: As I say in baseball, wait until next year unless somebody wants to discuss the matter right now.

877
01:08:03,926 --> 01:08:04,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for saying no.

878
01:08:06,446 --> 01:08:18,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, if I may ad lib this, problem number two we have, in my opinion, you may remember the lovely Russian lady brought this issue to this honorable body.

879
01:08:18,873 --> 01:08:22,235
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, but I never understood it until now.

880
01:08:22,795 --> 01:08:26,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I get it proposition two and a half.

881
01:08:26,237 --> 01:08:27,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to Barbara Anderson.

882
01:08:27,818 --> 01:08:35,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest her soul limits the tax levy, which is about a hundred million dollars last year to two and a half percent increase.

883
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:37,423
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about two and a half million dollars.

884
01:08:38,124 --> 01:08:43,507
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the new growth that we generated was 1.8 million.

885
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:47,789
[SPEAKER_00]: The city always goes up to the max within a hair.

886
01:08:48,807 --> 01:08:52,689
[SPEAKER_00]: which is $2.5 million, the new growth is $1.8 million.

887
01:08:52,969 --> 01:09:02,975
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are new buildings that just come out of nowhere to generate the extra $1.8 million of new real estate tax that never existed prior.

888
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:03,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.

889
01:09:05,196 --> 01:09:06,837
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Russian lady made a good point.

890
01:09:07,497 --> 01:09:16,122
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, take away a $2.5 million increase from Prop 2.5, and the new growth was $1.8 million, the increase should have been $700,000, period,

891
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,628
[SPEAKER_00]: versus 4.2 million.

892
01:09:21,168 --> 01:09:23,548
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like seven times.

893
01:09:24,389 --> 01:09:31,171
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could have saved maybe, instead of a $300 average increase, maybe it would have been like 50 bucks.

894
01:09:32,731 --> 01:09:37,453
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not a math scientist, but the math seems to tell the facts.

895
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:42,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure who was responsible for this injustice.

896
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:45,735
[SPEAKER_00]: By not first deducting the new growth,

897
01:09:47,723 --> 01:09:49,103
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Prop 2.5 increase.

898
01:09:52,085 --> 01:09:54,665
[SPEAKER_00]: As she used to say, it's like an annuity that keeps on giving.

899
01:09:56,046 --> 01:10:04,749
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 2.5% is based on the following year on a higher number, and we don't get any tax relief.

900
01:10:05,149 --> 01:10:16,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, we get hurt because we have to pay more police cars, more fire trucks, more schooling, more teachers,

901
01:10:20,123 --> 01:10:20,804
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand.

902
01:10:20,824 --> 01:10:25,647
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

903
01:10:27,028 --> 01:10:35,495
[SPEAKER_00]: In closing, if I may say, wishing some of you a merry Christmas and a happy Hanukkah and to all a good night.

904
01:10:41,099 --> 01:10:43,040
[SPEAKER_06]: One at Dolly chair recognizes council night.

905
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we're under suspension?

906
01:10:44,461 --> 01:10:49,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Mr. President, motion to take any paper that's been on the table for six months or more and receive in place on file.

907
01:10:49,552 --> 01:10:51,173
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion, all those in favor?

908
01:10:51,774 --> 01:10:51,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

909
01:10:53,335 --> 01:10:57,879
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

910
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:05,185
[SPEAKER_06]: 15-605, hearing National Grid and Verizon Canal Street table, August 16th, 2015.

911
01:11:06,046 --> 01:11:08,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to receive and place on file by Councilor Knight.

912
01:11:10,049 --> 01:11:10,990
[SPEAKER_06]: August 15th.

913
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:11,791
[SPEAKER_06]: 2015, my apologies.

914
01:11:13,832 --> 01:11:14,513
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

915
01:11:14,533 --> 01:11:14,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

916
01:11:14,893 --> 01:11:15,434
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

917
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:26,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Transfer $250,000 from sales real estate for five kiosks improvements in council, December 22nd, 2015 tabled.

918
01:11:26,959 --> 01:11:28,621
[SPEAKER_06]: That was under the old administration.

919
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:29,982
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no clarity on it.

920
01:11:30,702 --> 01:11:37,647
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, uh, it, uh, there's been no action for it on a year.

921
01:11:39,229 --> 01:11:39,709
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know.

922
01:11:42,651 --> 01:11:44,553
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be repurposed a year.

923
01:11:46,278 --> 01:11:46,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been there for a year.

924
01:11:47,058 --> 01:11:49,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a paper that was put forward by the previous administration.

925
01:11:49,559 --> 01:11:50,920
[SPEAKER_02]: It was tabled by a previous council.

926
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,921
[SPEAKER_02]: If the administration has an interest in pursuing it, they should refile the paper.

927
01:11:53,941 --> 01:11:56,382
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I look at it, it shouldn't cloud up our agenda.

928
01:11:58,103 --> 01:11:59,883
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll refile if they're going to repost it.

929
01:12:01,204 --> 01:12:01,564
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

930
01:12:01,964 --> 01:12:06,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I said that is to benefit the business owners in each of our business districts.

931
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:08,827
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we should get an answer before we

932
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:12,981
[SPEAKER_10]: take something off our agenda, Mr. President.

933
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:15,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's been on there a year.

934
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:17,625
[SPEAKER_10]: It's certainly not bothering me, Mr. President.

935
01:12:17,645 --> 01:12:24,690
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it deserves, on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce and every business in this community, to get an answer on it, Mr. President.

936
01:12:26,492 --> 01:12:30,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to send to the mayor's office to- I have a question, Mr. President.

937
01:12:30,915 --> 01:12:34,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if the paper's been sitting on the table for a year, then nothing was ever reported out of the council.

938
01:12:36,012 --> 01:12:41,653
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we waiting on an answer for if we never were able to ask the question because the paper was tabled and never moved from here?

939
01:12:42,013 --> 01:12:45,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So is the question that you're asking is to ask the administration whether?

940
01:12:45,074 --> 01:12:50,735
[SPEAKER_10]: There was several questions asked, Mr. President.

941
01:12:50,755 --> 01:12:55,296
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why the paper was put on the table.

942
01:12:55,316 --> 01:12:57,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember like it was yesterday that we asked

943
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:13,822
[SPEAKER_10]: that if there was $250,000 reserved for the business districts that we find out who would be responsible for giving out the money to each business district.

944
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:18,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it going to go to the West Meffitt business community or was it going to go to the chamber and so forth?

945
01:13:18,744 --> 01:13:25,808
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had a number of questions and maybe we have to just revisit to find out what the status is rather than just doing away with the paper.

946
01:13:26,008 --> 01:13:28,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Well then why don't we have a motion so we can get an answer?

947
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:32,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Constance Scott Pelly, if I can, not to be, um,

948
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,661
[SPEAKER_16]: just, just, I know nothing about this.

949
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:38,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a way that we can refile to get more information?

950
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:39,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that make a motion.

951
01:13:39,922 --> 01:13:41,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I make the motion that we refiles?

952
01:13:41,723 --> 01:13:42,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe that would be better.

953
01:13:42,663 --> 01:13:46,444
[SPEAKER_16]: So to request the administrator to update us on this matter, right?

954
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:50,025
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can understand if I don't, is that a suitable motion?

955
01:13:50,505 --> 01:13:51,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a suitable motion?

956
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:55,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone on that motion seconded by councilor Falco.

957
01:13:55,287 --> 01:13:57,628
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor.

958
01:13:58,208 --> 01:13:59,548
[SPEAKER_06]: 16 dash zero zero nine.

959
01:13:59,628 --> 01:14:00,449
[SPEAKER_06]: No confidence.

960
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:01,549
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a no confidence.

961
01:14:01,956 --> 01:14:04,617
[SPEAKER_06]: by a city put to me, a citizen put towards me.

962
01:14:04,657 --> 01:14:06,598
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tabled indefinitely pursuant to council rule.

963
01:14:06,638 --> 01:14:07,479
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't come up anyway.

964
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:08,759
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't come up anyway.

965
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:12,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Receive in place on file or does it stay on the table forever?

966
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:14,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Receive in place on file.

967
01:14:14,322 --> 01:14:15,182
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

968
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

969
01:14:16,663 --> 01:14:21,645
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee policies for future bomb threat 16-069 February 9th.

970
01:14:22,186 --> 01:14:24,827
[SPEAKER_06]: We got all that information in several subsequent meetings.

971
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:26,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to receive and place on file.

972
01:14:26,934 --> 01:14:29,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Have we ever received the full policy, Mr. President?

973
01:14:29,154 --> 01:14:30,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that was what we asked for.

974
01:14:30,515 --> 01:14:32,856
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we did in the budget.

975
01:14:34,116 --> 01:14:39,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we ask that we receive a copy of the full policy, Mr. President?

976
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:40,899
[SPEAKER_06]: On motion, Councillor Marx.

977
01:14:41,139 --> 01:14:42,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Mr. President?

978
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor.

979
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:50,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in response to the February bomb threats, the superintendent of schools was presented with accommodation from

980
01:14:50,522 --> 01:14:56,223
[SPEAKER_02]: the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents on how it was handled and the policy that was put in place after the fact, if I'm not mistaken.

981
01:14:56,543 --> 01:14:59,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there was also a press release or an article that was put out about that.

982
01:15:00,384 --> 01:15:03,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so if we can get a copy of the policy, that's all I'm asking.

983
01:15:03,805 --> 01:15:11,086
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, 16-063, that a copy of the policy be sent to the council.

984
01:15:11,526 --> 01:15:12,286
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

985
01:15:12,306 --> 01:15:12,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

986
01:15:12,666 --> 01:15:13,366
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

987
01:15:13,386 --> 01:15:14,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion granted.

988
01:15:14,387 --> 01:15:15,087
[SPEAKER_06]: 16-472, accounting use

989
01:15:17,123 --> 01:15:21,826
[SPEAKER_06]: of school facilities for free or donation in council May 10, 2016.

990
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:23,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we up to six months?

991
01:15:24,428 --> 01:15:30,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been there for six months and there has been a policy that's been adopted by the policymaking body that affects the school use facilities, the school committee.

992
01:15:31,633 --> 01:15:34,155
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion that this be received and placed on file.

993
01:15:34,395 --> 01:15:35,216
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

994
01:15:35,476 --> 01:15:35,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

995
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:36,437
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

996
01:15:36,597 --> 01:15:38,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carries.

997
01:15:38,878 --> 01:15:41,260
[SPEAKER_06]: 16-629, residents addresses pedestrian safety.

998
01:15:41,657 --> 01:15:47,778
[SPEAKER_06]: We've discussed this ad nauseum on several locations throughout the city over the past 90 months.

999
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:49,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to receive and place on file.

1000
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:51,019
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1001
01:15:51,219 --> 01:15:51,919
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1002
01:15:52,659 --> 01:15:54,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion granted.

1003
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:54,280
[SPEAKER_06]: 16-636.

1004
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Special permit for Kino.

1005
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:59,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Monitor NK convenience.

1006
01:16:00,821 --> 01:16:02,241
[SPEAKER_06]: That was October.

1007
01:16:03,802 --> 01:16:04,842
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs action in 90 days.

1008
01:16:07,924 --> 01:16:10,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It was here September 20th, Mr. President.

1009
01:16:10,044 --> 01:16:11,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Today would be the 90th day.

1010
01:16:13,145 --> 01:16:16,886
[SPEAKER_02]: They get it by right after 90 days.

1011
01:16:16,986 --> 01:16:18,706
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to come back to us.

1012
01:16:18,786 --> 01:16:19,866
[SPEAKER_02]: They get it constructively.

1013
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:22,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the council's actually not taking action.

1014
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:24,928
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sitting on it and we're letting them get the license.

1015
01:16:26,088 --> 01:16:32,309
[SPEAKER_02]: The question, because the matter was tabled, we wanted the question answered, but the question never got reported out of the, out of the council because the matter was tabled.

1016
01:16:33,605 --> 01:16:35,766
[SPEAKER_02]: So, because the matter was tabled, the question was never reported out.

1017
01:16:35,806 --> 01:16:37,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the question was never reported out, we never got the answer.

1018
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:40,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we never got the answer, today is the 90th day.

1019
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:46,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some concerns as to sitting on our hands and saying, let a constructive acceptance go through them, Mr. President.

1020
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:52,429
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'll certainly do what my council colleagues feel is appropriate.

1021
01:16:52,449 --> 01:16:53,329
[SPEAKER_10]: So, what was the question?

1022
01:16:53,869 --> 01:16:54,349
[SPEAKER_02]: The question was.

1023
01:16:54,369 --> 01:16:55,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what the question was.

1024
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the slides.

1025
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:02,304
[SPEAKER_02]: what are the city council, what's the city's rights in terms of whether or not they grant or don't create the keynote license?

1026
01:17:02,324 --> 01:17:04,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what happens if we say no, what comes next?

1027
01:17:05,046 --> 01:17:07,168
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was the question that we couldn't get out to the administration.

1028
01:17:07,188 --> 01:17:08,850
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the question that got tabled.

1029
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:16,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe a council one go table the matter because there was some opposition in the crowd and she wanted to see if there was some feedback that we could get.

1030
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:18,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we all agreed to say, okay, let's get some feedback.

1031
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,963
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried to get the feedback, but because the paper never went out,

1032
01:17:22,842 --> 01:17:26,283
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion that we get the question, the question never got sent to the city solicitor.

1033
01:17:26,303 --> 01:17:31,725
[SPEAKER_02]: So because the question never got sent, we never got an answer, but off the table now, September 20th, October 20th.

1034
01:17:31,925 --> 01:17:33,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So 90 days from the date that they were here.

1035
01:17:33,926 --> 01:17:35,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a constructive acceptance.

1036
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,447
[SPEAKER_02]: If in fact, so what's the motion on the table?

1037
01:17:42,568 --> 01:17:45,349
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll make the motion that we revisit it anyway, even if it's with this.

1038
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:49,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that the way that we should, Mr. President, if I can recommend, um,

1039
01:17:53,245 --> 01:17:56,186
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly my concern because it's also included in the zoning act.

1040
01:17:56,206 --> 01:17:57,346
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do something with it.

1041
01:17:59,986 --> 01:18:03,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't think we're gonna meet in two January.

1042
01:18:05,487 --> 01:18:10,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I'm a little confused.

1043
01:18:10,588 --> 01:18:18,609
[SPEAKER_10]: The, the fact that a paper is before us as a, as a resolution and we may have a question on the paper itself, right?

1044
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:21,630
[SPEAKER_10]: From what I'm hearing from some of my colleagues, it appears that,

1045
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:25,379
[SPEAKER_10]: we have to approve the paper in order to get questions answered.

1046
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:28,600
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think that's necessarily true.

1047
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:33,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I think we can request as a council to get answers.

1048
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:51,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, we had a counselor nights resolution a few weeks ago about setting up a reserve account in the city and we didn't support that as a council, but we did support sending it to the mayor to see if the mayor, um, uh, thought it was appropriate, uh, for, uh, the setting of,

1049
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:52,130
[SPEAKER_10]: a reserve account.

1050
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:58,614
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not quite sure the fact that we don't approve something necessarily means that we can't get something answered.

1051
01:18:58,894 --> 01:19:09,879
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it is, then we have to change our council rules because that, that doesn't make any sense to me that we have to approve something before we can get some answers or in order to get access that has been here.

1052
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:10,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,

1053
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:15,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that the question was asked before the matter was tabled, Mr. President.

1054
01:19:15,895 --> 01:19:17,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So the matter was tabled, the debate was ended.

1055
01:19:17,678 --> 01:19:19,080
[SPEAKER_02]: We voted on the tabling of the issue.

1056
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:23,145
[SPEAKER_02]: The question never got reported out because the question was asked after the matter was tabled, if I remember correctly.

1057
01:19:23,577 --> 01:19:26,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, it's a matter that needs housekeeping for whatever reason.

1058
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:26,740
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the table.

1059
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:27,841
[SPEAKER_02]: The 90th day is coming up.

1060
01:19:27,921 --> 01:19:35,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to make our mind up as to whether or not we want to allow a constructive table, return it to the table.

1061
01:19:35,527 --> 01:19:43,594
[SPEAKER_02]: If it stays on the table, they're going to get a constructive approval of the license, but it might also open the city up to some legal ramifications because it's also included as part of a zoning act.

1062
01:19:43,614 --> 01:19:45,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to give them a decision one way or the other.

1063
01:19:46,236 --> 01:19:48,298
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the petitioner reached out to the city clerk.

1064
01:19:48,318 --> 01:19:49,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you heard from the petitioner?

1065
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,379
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the petitioner.

1066
01:19:52,695 --> 01:19:52,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1067
01:19:52,895 --> 01:19:59,982
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they reach out since they're the one that stated the law, they, they, they knew right off the bat what you guys were doing.

1068
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:03,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're waiting for the timeframe to end.

1069
01:20:05,707 --> 01:20:14,155
[SPEAKER_02]: But nothing that doesn't preclude them from still pursuing relief through the zoning act and maybe holding us accountable in that regard, whether or not we're subject to litigation.

1070
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:26,647
[SPEAKER_02]: by accepting a constructive approval of a matter that's also outlined in a zoning act, which says that we need to give a special permit to make a decision on it, might leave us open to some legal situation, Mr. President, some legal liability.

1071
01:20:30,788 --> 01:20:35,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that the way to handle this would be, Mr. President, we can, I mean, I know that

1072
01:20:36,084 --> 01:20:43,226
[SPEAKER_02]: majority of the council was opposed to issuing the license, but if we don't do issue the light, if we don't issue the license, then we might be open to opening us up.

1073
01:20:43,246 --> 01:20:45,947
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't take any vote.

1074
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:48,047
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you know majority of the council was opposed to it?

1075
01:20:48,447 --> 01:21:00,571
[SPEAKER_06]: And based upon the discussion that night, that's a big conclusion to move to take the matter off the table and move for approval on the motion for council tonight to take the table off and motion for approval.

1076
01:21:00,591 --> 01:21:01,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1077
01:21:08,729 --> 01:21:14,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, special permit use, kino monitor, NK convenience, 562 high school.

1078
01:21:14,571 --> 01:21:16,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The first motion is to take the matter off the table.

1079
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:19,012
[SPEAKER_02]: If the council doesn't want to take the matter off the table, then that's fine.

1080
01:21:19,412 --> 01:21:20,993
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion is to take it off the table.

1081
01:21:21,033 --> 01:21:21,793
[SPEAKER_06]: My apologies.

1082
01:21:22,453 --> 01:21:23,774
[SPEAKER_06]: The council has clarified me.

1083
01:21:24,654 --> 01:21:26,215
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion is to take it off the table.

1084
01:21:27,915 --> 01:21:30,456
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion to take it off the table, all those in favor?

1085
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:30,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1086
01:21:31,556 --> 01:21:32,237
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1087
01:21:32,257 --> 01:21:33,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1088
01:21:33,037 --> 01:21:36,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair in doubt, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to take this paper off the table.

01:22:10,746 --> 01:22:18,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so clerk Finn, if we don't take a vote on it, it's going to get approved in two days.

1112
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:22,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Their license will be approved in two days.

1113
01:22:22,094 --> 01:22:23,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, do you?

1114
01:22:24,276 --> 01:22:27,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the legal opinion, but that has been the practice.

1115
01:22:27,599 --> 01:22:27,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1116
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:28,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1117
01:22:28,379 --> 01:22:28,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1118
01:22:28,739 --> 01:22:38,347
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have 90 days from the, from the hearing, uh, to make a decision or else it's going to get approved.

1119
01:22:40,842 --> 01:22:41,542
[SPEAKER_02]: point of information.

1120
01:22:41,622 --> 01:22:45,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a two, it's a double edged sword him as the president.

1121
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:50,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the council has to act within 90 days of receiving the application and that's okay.

1122
01:22:50,824 --> 01:22:54,084
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't, they constructed, they, that's a constructive approval and they get the license.

1123
01:22:54,484 --> 01:22:59,985
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's also a question is because it's included in the zoning act and it says that we need to make an action within those 90 days.

1124
01:23:00,045 --> 01:23:03,966
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't, is there a liability on the city for not acting?

1125
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:04,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1126
01:23:07,927 --> 01:23:09,787
[SPEAKER_06]: We have motion for approval on the floor chair.

1127
01:23:09,847 --> 01:23:10,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a second.

1128
01:23:13,356 --> 01:23:14,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1129
01:23:16,577 --> 01:23:17,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caviello?

1130
01:23:17,338 --> 01:23:17,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1131
01:23:18,178 --> 01:23:18,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

1132
01:23:18,858 --> 01:23:19,018
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1133
01:23:20,139 --> 01:23:20,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Nights?

1134
01:23:20,839 --> 01:23:21,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1135
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:23,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Low and Current?

1136
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:23,500
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1137
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:24,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Moxley?

1138
01:23:25,061 --> 01:23:25,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1139
01:23:25,861 --> 01:23:26,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1140
01:23:27,082 --> 01:23:27,302
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1141
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:29,623
[SPEAKER_06]: President Del Russo?

1142
01:23:30,163 --> 01:23:30,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1143
01:23:30,803 --> 01:23:33,544
[SPEAKER_06]: The vote is 4 in the affirmative, 3 in the negative.

1144
01:23:34,185 --> 01:23:34,645
[SPEAKER_06]: It passes.

1145
01:23:36,097 --> 01:23:38,359
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it fails.

1146
01:23:38,439 --> 01:23:39,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs a five.

1147
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:45,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And I need to have stated reasons for the denial.

1148
01:23:46,045 --> 01:23:46,406
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1149
01:23:46,926 --> 01:23:55,333
[SPEAKER_06]: So the motion fails and the clerk requires stated reasons for why those people did not vote in favor.

1150
01:23:55,813 --> 01:23:57,334
[SPEAKER_06]: We will start on the roll call.

1151
01:23:57,374 --> 01:24:00,257
[SPEAKER_06]: The first negative vote was Councilor Falcone.

1152
01:24:01,572 --> 01:24:03,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Your reasons for not voting in the affirmative.

1153
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:06,914
[SPEAKER_13]: I can give you something in writing if you want, but I don't have...

1154
01:24:26,102 --> 01:24:27,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Request for a brief recess.

1155
01:24:27,664 --> 01:24:30,989
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been made by Council of Knight.

1156
01:24:31,389 --> 01:24:35,335
[SPEAKER_06]: The Council remains in recess until being recalled.

1157
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:27,442
[SPEAKER_06]: The matter before us is item number 16-636, six, special permit use, keno monitor, NK, convenience, 562 High Street.

1158
01:30:27,482 --> 01:30:40,665
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a vote taken to not, a non-successful vote to grant the special permit, and we're awaiting discussion on the reasons.

1159
01:30:41,105 --> 01:30:42,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes the Vice President.

1160
01:30:43,586 --> 01:30:47,128
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'll yield to- Yield to Councillor Falco.

1161
01:30:47,529 --> 01:30:49,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councillor Falco.

1162
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:50,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1163
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:54,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to move for reconsideration so we can move this to zoning subcommittee.

1164
01:30:54,253 --> 01:30:56,134
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion for reconsideration.

1165
01:30:56,774 --> 01:30:57,815
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1166
01:30:57,835 --> 01:30:58,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1167
01:30:59,116 --> 01:31:00,096
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1168
01:31:01,477 --> 01:31:02,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in opposition.

1169
01:31:02,478 --> 01:31:03,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair is in doubt.

1170
01:31:03,418 --> 01:31:06,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, call the roll for reconsideration.

1171
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,742
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a reconsideration vote first.

1172
01:31:08,762 --> 01:31:09,882
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to get the reconsideration vote first.

1173
01:31:10,203 --> 01:31:10,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1174
01:31:11,403 --> 01:31:12,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for reconsideration.

1175
01:31:12,943 --> 01:31:14,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1176
01:31:20,105 --> 01:31:20,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caviello?

1177
01:31:20,845 --> 01:31:21,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1178
01:31:22,805 --> 01:31:23,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

1179
01:31:23,585 --> 01:31:23,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1180
01:31:24,425 --> 01:31:25,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

1181
01:31:25,045 --> 01:31:25,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1182
01:31:25,766 --> 01:31:26,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Long-Term?

1183
01:31:26,686 --> 01:31:27,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1184
01:31:27,906 --> 01:31:28,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Frosch?

1185
01:31:28,646 --> 01:31:29,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1186
01:31:29,386 --> 01:31:30,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scott-Gilliam?

1187
01:31:30,386 --> 01:31:30,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1188
01:31:31,247 --> 01:31:32,047
[SPEAKER_04]: President Del Rosso?

1189
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:32,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1190
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:34,667
[SPEAKER_06]: The vote is seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

1191
01:31:35,007 --> 01:31:37,388
[SPEAKER_06]: The matter is in force for reconsideration.

1192
01:31:38,268 --> 01:31:39,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair awaits a motion.

1193
01:31:41,945 --> 01:31:43,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair awaits a motion.

1194
01:31:43,026 --> 01:31:46,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

1195
01:31:47,047 --> 01:31:49,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval on the floor.

1196
01:31:50,889 --> 01:31:53,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'd like to move this to subcommittee.

1197
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:54,271
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion.

1198
01:31:55,071 --> 01:31:56,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Falco.

1199
01:31:57,552 --> 01:32:03,595
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should move it to subcommittee because I know myself, this is the first time that I'm voting on a license like this.

1200
01:32:04,135 --> 01:32:06,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never had a vote on a license like this before.

1201
01:32:06,457 --> 01:32:08,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it needs more research.

1202
01:32:08,417 --> 01:32:11,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this may be, I won't speak for all of us, but I think there's a few of us that,

1203
01:32:11,983 --> 01:32:13,604
[SPEAKER_11]: have a few questions that need to be addressed.

1204
01:32:14,384 --> 01:32:18,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, uh, by the city solicitor and they haven't been addressed because it was tabled.

1205
01:32:19,647 --> 01:32:21,328
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we should move this to subcommittee.

1206
01:32:21,348 --> 01:32:22,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So those questions can be addressed.

1207
01:32:23,189 --> 01:32:26,351
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we take future votes, we're all on the same page.

1208
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:29,333
[SPEAKER_11]: We said, feel like right now, maybe there's some of us that aren't.

1209
01:32:29,393 --> 01:32:32,455
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two contradictory motions before us.

1210
01:32:32,475 --> 01:32:33,855
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion approved by council.

1211
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:35,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't be held council.

1212
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:35,917
[SPEAKER_06]: You wish to be recognized?

1213
01:32:35,937 --> 01:32:36,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I do.

1214
01:32:36,457 --> 01:32:36,857
[SPEAKER_15]: It's present.

1215
01:32:36,877 --> 01:32:40,119
[SPEAKER_15]: So if, if I'm understanding this right, if we don't vote for this in the next,

1216
01:32:41,221 --> 01:32:43,021
[SPEAKER_15]: In two days, he automatically gets his license.

1217
01:32:43,041 --> 01:32:45,402
[SPEAKER_15]: So he gets his license automatically, is that correct?

1218
01:32:46,342 --> 01:32:47,202
[SPEAKER_15]: He's going to get his license.

1219
01:32:47,222 --> 01:32:52,423
[SPEAKER_15]: So if it goes to subcommittee, the mayor's going to get his license anyways.

1220
01:32:53,344 --> 01:32:53,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct?

1221
01:32:53,984 --> 01:32:54,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1222
01:32:54,344 --> 01:32:57,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a B paper, chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1223
01:32:57,684 --> 01:33:02,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the question wasn't whether or not the gentleman was going to get his license constructively after 90 days.

1224
01:33:02,185 --> 01:33:08,727
[SPEAKER_02]: The question was whether or not by the council being inactive on the matter, we're opening the city up to a liability in the courts of law.

1225
01:33:09,187 --> 01:33:09,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1226
01:33:10,812 --> 01:33:12,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, councillor.

1227
01:33:14,175 --> 01:33:17,737
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we have two contradictory motions before us.

1228
01:33:18,198 --> 01:33:21,540
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take councillor Falco's motion as a B paper.

1229
01:33:22,761 --> 01:33:37,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on the B paper that the matter be sent to subcommittee for further examination as in the year some councillors have been on the council, they've not met such a conundrum.

1230
01:33:37,673 --> 01:33:38,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1231
01:33:51,387 --> 01:33:52,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caviello?

1232
01:33:52,307 --> 01:33:52,487
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1233
01:33:53,388 --> 01:33:54,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Favreau?

1234
01:33:54,088 --> 01:33:54,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1235
01:33:54,949 --> 01:33:55,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Mayne?

1236
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:55,709
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1237
01:33:56,929 --> 01:33:57,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice-President O'Kerr?

1238
01:33:57,890 --> 01:33:58,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1239
01:33:59,190 --> 01:33:59,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Matz?

1240
01:33:59,971 --> 01:34:00,251
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1241
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:02,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scott Kelly?

1242
01:34:02,152 --> 01:34:02,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1243
01:34:03,192 --> 01:34:03,973
[SPEAKER_04]: President De La Ruza?

1244
01:34:04,353 --> 01:34:04,573
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1245
01:34:04,953 --> 01:34:08,935
[SPEAKER_06]: The vote of four in the negative, three in the positive, the motion fails.

1246
01:34:09,715 --> 01:34:12,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Now to the motion of Councilor Caviello for approval.

1247
01:34:14,437 --> 01:34:15,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1248
01:34:23,973 --> 01:34:24,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1249
01:34:25,094 --> 01:34:32,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information on that, Councilor Knight, where individuals that are voting in opposition have to state the reasons they are for.

1250
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:37,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they required to do that while they take the vote, after they take the vote, before they take the vote, during when they take the vote?

1251
01:34:37,242 --> 01:34:40,884
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the procedure in terms of how that's to be done?

1252
01:34:41,725 --> 01:34:52,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor, they should, and it has been past practice, and I would recommend as president that the councilors

1253
01:34:52,688 --> 01:35:02,394
[SPEAKER_06]: state their reason for opposition as they take their vote or subsequent immediately to it before the clerk calls the roll on the next member of the council.

1254
01:35:02,414 --> 01:35:03,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that satisfactory to everyone?

1255
01:35:04,535 --> 01:35:06,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1256
01:35:08,057 --> 01:35:08,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caviello?

1257
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:09,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1258
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:10,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falcone?

1259
01:35:10,999 --> 01:35:11,199
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1260
01:35:12,019 --> 01:35:13,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your reason, Councilor.

1261
01:35:14,901 --> 01:35:18,683
[SPEAKER_11]: So my reasons are, and I've talked to many residents about this,

1262
01:35:19,248 --> 01:35:29,455
