1

[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Medford Community Development Board.

00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:42,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

27
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I should have verbally said that I acknowledge when I saw you.

28
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:47,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

29
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:59,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, representing the cities, myself, Danielle Evans, senior planner in the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, along with Alicia Hunt, who is the director of PDS.

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, so we will go to the first item on our agenda, which is a public hearing for 200 Mystic Ave, special permit to establish a motor vehicle watch.

31
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:14,150
[SPEAKER_03]: This was open and continued without discussion at the last meeting.

32
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:21,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I will ask the applicant to present, and I believe Attorney Adam Dash is presenting.

33
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:25,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Attorney Dash, you may take the floor.

34
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:53,112
[SPEAKER_10]: good evening i'm sure thank you members of the board staff uh... weekend also with me tonight i i'm attorney adam dash forty eight grove street in somerville representing uh... the applicant owner new york capital investment group l l c which owns and operates the prestige car wash brand with us are near dory and ronan drury from uh... where the applicant owner from the company as well as helene shubha from shubha engineering group he receives the project engineer

35
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:55,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have the ability to share my screen?

36
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:58,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not, if someone could give me that permission.

37
00:02:58,255 --> 00:02:59,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have some slides.

38
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:13,666
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an application for a used special permit to establish a motor vehicle car wash in an enclosed structure at 200 Mystic Avenue, which is in the C2 zoning district and was last used as a motor freight terminal.

39
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:16,368
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, great.

40
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:16,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

41
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:22,692
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, you should be able to see my screen now.

42
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:24,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

43
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:25,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

44
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:31,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So, just to orient you, this slide shows you the C2 is the red that you're showing, that we're showing here.

45
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:47,275
[SPEAKER_10]: The property is located between Billings Avenue and Boeing Avenue, which is here, and is sandwiched between Mystic Avenue and 93, so front's on Mystic and back's on to the 93 area, so you're talking about basically right there.

46
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:55,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Here you can see the exterior of the existing building, which is going to be demolished as part of the proposal.

47
00:03:55,898 --> 00:04:00,700
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can see, the site is also pretty much entirely paved.

48
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,462
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not an attractive site at the present.

49
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:07,844
[SPEAKER_10]: The applicant purchased the property to build a new car wash.

50
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:16,348
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see here some additional images of the existing building, the one that has the M&S Express sign on it, which is the motor vehicle terminal.

51
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:19,690
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see the curb cut in the driveway to the right of the existing building.

52
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,111
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we've got here, let me enlarge this a bit.

53
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,291
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to show you the context that we're dealing with.

54
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:37,254
[SPEAKER_10]: So this, to provide some context, you can see in the middle here, this is the 200 Mystic Avenue property on the street view photo.

55
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:41,235
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can see the string of single-story commercial buildings along Mystic Avenue.

56
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:44,676
[SPEAKER_10]: All of these have Route 93 in the rear.

57
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:47,896
[SPEAKER_10]: To the right of us is of the building.

58
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,077
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see this is an existing roofing company.

59
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:57,040
[SPEAKER_10]: To the left over here, you can see this is an existing auto body shop, and again 93 is behind these.

60
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:03,963
[SPEAKER_10]: These slides are going to show the street in both directions around 200 Mystic.

61
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:10,066
[SPEAKER_10]: 200 Mystic is the building here, this is the roofing company here, behind here is the

62
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:14,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Autobody shops, you can sort of get a series of the context here.

63
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:21,434
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can see the streets almost exclusively made up of single-story commercial buildings, many of which are for various automotive uses.

64
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:26,738
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can also see how wide Mystic Ave here, which I believe the survey says is 99 feet wide.

65
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:29,099
[SPEAKER_10]: This is looking in the other direction.

66
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, here now on the left is 200 Mystic Ave.

67
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:33,503
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the autobody shop.

68
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:35,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Down here is the roofing company.

69
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:42,186
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see here the snap-on tools parked here and all this other automotive activity going on in this area and all the single-story buildings.

70
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:48,608
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is again showing the property.

71
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:54,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let me get this back to the correct size.

72
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:03,656
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so this is the plan showing the existing condition of the property, which is outlined here in the dark.

73
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:10,843
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a 25,220 square foot lot, which is pretty large.

74
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:15,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, 93 to the right, Mystic Avenue here to the left.

75
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:25,603
[SPEAKER_10]: And this shows also the, the erosion and sediment control.

76
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:27,404
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the erosion sediment control plan.

77
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:29,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Mr. Shubham is here too.

78
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:32,345
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to get into details, I won't go into it right at the moment.

79
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:43,349
[SPEAKER_10]: This shows again, so this is showing the proposed site plan with a 3900 square foot building here in the smaller rectangle in the middle.

80
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:48,472
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got 900 square feet of landscaping on the site where there currently is none.

81
00:06:48,492 --> 00:07:08,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Due to the configuration of the lot here, the building is turned on the side like this so that it reduces its visibility along Mystic Avenue of the use and it also prevents stacking of cars on the street because you can see they can come in and circle around and through.

82
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:17,491
[SPEAKER_10]: So, cars can easily move around the site without queuing on Domestic Avenue with the building in this configuration.

83
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:27,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Big cars will enter and exit the site to the right side of the building, as the motor vehicle, motor freight use did.

84
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:34,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And I showed you the, look, this is basically the same location as the current entrance for the existing building.

85
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:36,514
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is...

86
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:44,280
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so this is the landscaping plan, which is showing all native plantings.

87
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:53,705
[SPEAKER_10]: There are three trees proposed, one here, one here, one here, so two along the street, and then one right here before all the parking spaces.

88
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:59,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I should note that no landscaping is required here.

89
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:01,270
[SPEAKER_10]: However, this is what we're proposing.

90
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,052
[SPEAKER_10]: There are 14 parking spaces that are required.

91
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:08,414
[SPEAKER_10]: 15 are provided on site here along the building.

92
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:12,997
[SPEAKER_10]: One loading space is required and one loading space is being provided.

93
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:25,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so these are the grading drainage and utility plans with a lot more detail.

94
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:30,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if the board has questions, we do have the engineer here to discuss them.

95
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:34,199
[SPEAKER_10]: And more of the same.

96
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,263
[SPEAKER_10]: And these are more some more details of the grading and the drainage.

97
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:47,431
[SPEAKER_10]: So, these are elevations and renderings we're going to show you of the proposed building, which is attractive and will be an improvement to the area.

98
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,254
[SPEAKER_10]: The proposed car wash use.

99
00:08:52,875 --> 00:09:18,222
[SPEAKER_10]: this is the rendering should be approved as because a special permit should be granted a special permit for the use because it meets the requirements for one first off the project serves social economic or community needs because the existing industrial unattractive and non-conforming building will be replaced with a new good-looking dimensionally compliant building that will conform landscaping will be provided where there's currently none and will be all native plantings

100
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:22,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford residents will be given preferential hiring in these jobs.

101
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:25,529
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be a total of nine employees proposed for the site.

102
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,276
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is important for the city to have job opportunities for all skill levels and education levels.

103
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:36,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Two, the project addresses traffic flow, safety, parking and loading.

104
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:39,228
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be the required number of loading spaces.

105
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:42,090
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be one more parking space than required.

106
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:55,580
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be an increase, and Mr. Shubaugh can discuss this, and there is a report that he filed with our application where he states there's an increase of 14 trips per hour over the prior motor freight use.

107
00:09:56,181 --> 00:10:00,724
[SPEAKER_10]: And these trips are by car, they're not by the trucks that the motor freight used to have.

108
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:07,491
[SPEAKER_10]: So we believe that the impact of the vehicles, even though there might be more vehicles, is actually going to be less because there are cars.

109
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:10,354
[SPEAKER_10]: We also note that a car wash is not a destination.

110
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:14,478
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a gas station that it captures cars already passing by.

111
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:16,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So we don't believe this is a traffic generator.

112
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:24,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Applicant also, if you're familiar with Prestige Car Wash maybe, they sell memberships to its customers as an option.

113
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:30,605
[SPEAKER_10]: So customers on this side of town, instead of going to the other Prestige Car Wash, would instead go to this one.

114
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:37,608
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not necessarily a net increase in traffic, it's more of a redistribution, at least that's the thought.

115
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:46,591
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the perfect location for car wash being sandwiched between Mystic Avenue and 93, we believe.

116
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:50,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Third, there are adequate utilities and public services in the area.

117
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:55,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Per Mr. Shubha's report, there will be no impact on the utility infrastructure.

118
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:59,499
[SPEAKER_10]: It will use the existing electric gas sewer system serving the premises.

119
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:06,043
[SPEAKER_10]: I would note that due to the system, 80% of the water on the site that's used for car washing is recycled.

120
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:10,406
[SPEAKER_10]: So the existing connections are adequate for this use.

121
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:17,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Fourth, the project is compatible with size, scale, design of other structures in the neighborhood.

122
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:25,435
[SPEAKER_10]: As shown, the project replaces the ugly non-conforming industrial building with no landscaping with a new conforming building with landscaping.

123
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:31,579
[SPEAKER_10]: The neighborhood is made up of single-story commercial buildings, many of which are auto-related and is adjacent to 93.

124
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:40,054
[SPEAKER_10]: While the city may be looking to change this zoning for Mystic Avenue, this stretch of Mystic Avenue is industrial and abuts the highway.

125
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:51,062
[SPEAKER_10]: These uses, honestly, are not going anywhere, and the proposed car wash structure is compliant, and the use is good for the long transition the city is discussing, which we fully support.

126
00:11:51,922 --> 00:12:04,226
[SPEAKER_10]: However, at the time, as of today, the zoning has not changed, and this application must be judged under the current law, and the project meets the current requirements for the proposed conforming structure and conforming use.

127
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:19,052
[SPEAKER_10]: I would note this happened in Somerville when I was involved with that in 2019 when they changed their zoning, and up until the very night that the City Council changed the zoning, the boards were approving projects under the prior zoning that the new zoning would have banned.

128
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:22,954
[SPEAKER_10]: So, because the law is the law, until it's no longer the law.

129
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,998
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a vast improvement, what we're showing here on the existing situation.

130
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:35,804
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are actually limited uses, which would realistically be sandwiched between Mystic Avenue and 93 in this location.

131
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:39,087
[SPEAKER_10]: The car washing will be fully contained within the building.

132
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:41,257
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll meet the noise requirements.

133
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:44,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I would note being again sandwiched between mystic and ninety three.

134
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:56,394
[SPEAKER_10]: This is never going to be an exactly quiet site, but the applicant is proposing to screen the vacuum motors with offense and rigid foam installation and the tunnel of the property at the property.

135
00:12:57,015 --> 00:13:01,739
[SPEAKER_10]: will at the property line will comply with the noise regulations.

136
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:07,363
[SPEAKER_10]: The staff report does reference applicants other locations being too noisy.

137
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:22,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I would note that at that location the vacuum motors are not screened and I don't know exactly how close at that other location the exit to the interior of the washing is but here it's 44 feet away from Mystic Avenue which is pretty far.

138
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,036
[SPEAKER_10]: So we believe that the

139
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:35,674
[SPEAKER_10]: that the noise will be compliant and certainly if there are ever any issues, that would be addressed because we have to be compliant and the client understands that.

140
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:37,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Fifth, impact on the natural environment.

141
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:43,019
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll convert the property to a conforming use and conforming structure.

142
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:51,427
[SPEAKER_10]: will reduce stormwater runoff with landscaping and collecting the roof runoff into an on-site infiltration system for groundwater discharge.

143
00:13:52,708 --> 00:14:01,134
[SPEAKER_10]: The car wash will have a closed drainage system in compliance with Medford Stormwater Management Ordinance and the MATS DEP guidelines.

144
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:06,697
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I said before, through that system, 80% of the water used is recycled and reused for car washing.

145
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:11,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Prestige will use environmentally friendly biodegradable cleaning products.

146
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:18,026
[SPEAKER_10]: and a water reclamation system, which treats, cleans, and reuses the water, as I said, to reduce water usage.

147
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:24,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Exterior mechanical equipment will be enclosed with the fence and the installation, as I described.

148
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:39,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Lastly, the project complies with the city's comprehensive plan by creating good-paying jobs, having preferential hiring of Medford residents, providing jobs for different skill and education levels, revitalizing a decrepit site,

149
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:59,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Adding landscaping where there is none and using native plantings, adding a nice looking building, reducing traffic, improving stormwater runoff, allowing Medford residents to spend their money locally, beautifying the Mystic Avenue corridor in this location, which is made up of industrial and commercial buildings, backing onto 93.

150
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:06,812
[SPEAKER_10]: The applicant's narrative cited 11 sections of the Medford Comprehensive Plan which this project meets.

151
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:18,043
[SPEAKER_10]: I will not read them all now in the interest of time, but the structure, which needs no relief, and the use, which needs a special permit but the use is allowed, do comply with the Comprehensive Plan.

152
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,926
[SPEAKER_10]: The impact of the project is positive.

153
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:22,148
[SPEAKER_10]: It meets

154
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:36,614
[SPEAKER_10]: It meets the law as it stands today, and will fit in well with any future development on this portion of Mystic Avenue, which is a tough site for residential and a lot of other uses, and which will be commercial and industrial for a long time, even if the zoning does change.

155
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:44,478
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be, again, sandwiched between Mystic and 93 with all the noise that that brings, which does not disturb this use, obviously.

156
00:15:45,298 --> 00:15:50,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Representatives from Prestige and the project engineer are here if the board has any specific questions about any of this.

157
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:55,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to point out the staff report raises points about mass DOT approval and such.

158
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,304
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not needed for the special permit approval now.

159
00:15:59,205 --> 00:15:59,965
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll come later.

160
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:06,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, despite what the staff report does say, the, however, applicant did provide a utility plan.

161
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:12,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I showed that a moment ago, and that was provided back on October 9th in response to questions.

162
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:15,716
[SPEAKER_10]: So we believe that the application does have everything there.

163
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:26,360
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do know that the landscaping plan you hadn't seen until just now, we didn't have it until now, because once we saw the staff report was requesting a landscape plan, we went and prioritized getting that.

164
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that staff report did ask how many trees, and the answer is

165
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:30,722
[SPEAKER_10]: free.

166
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:42,871
[SPEAKER_10]: So, in sum, the applicant asks that the special permit for motor vehicle car wash within an enclosed structure use be granted because all the elements of the special permit have been met.

167
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:53,738
[SPEAKER_10]: This project brings the current non-conforming situation into conformity with the Medford zoning ordinance and the Medford comprehensive plan as they are today, which is all that matters.

168
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:54,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

169
00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:58,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Attorney Dash.

170
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:10,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I open it up to the board, one of the things I want to go back to Attorney Dash's statement is that, yes, the law is the law, but I also want to remind the board and the public that this use is not by right.

171
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want the board to keep that in mind as we move forward.

172
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:18,496
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the onus is on us to make sure that the adverse effects

173
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:33,465
[SPEAKER_03]: will not outweigh any benefits for that area, and it must meet all criteria as defined by the city's ordinances, and that includes performance standards.

174
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:44,452
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, before I open it up to the board, I would ask that the city staff please, if you can summarize your findings for the board and for the public.

175
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:47,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

176
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:53,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney Dash did a good job of going through my points.

177
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:58,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't agree that it meets the special permit standards.

178
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:09,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the differences are that we now have an adopted comprehensive plan, and that is criterion number six, that the proposal is compatibility with the purposes of the city's comprehensive plan.

179
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:18,490
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have draft zoning, and yes, we're not going by our draft zoning, but even if we didn't have it,

180
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:23,213
[SPEAKER_06]: ready yet which we'll be going to in a couple weeks.

181
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Comprehensive plan really outlines the goals for this quarter.

182
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:30,879
[SPEAKER_06]: We're moving away from automotive uses.

183
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:37,183
[SPEAKER_06]: We already changed all of the automotive uses or the majority of them to be special permits.

184
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,664
[SPEAKER_06]: We did that over a year ago.

185
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:43,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I should note this use has always been a special permit.

186
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:54,232
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has always been recognized as a use that should not be by right in this district, that there could be potential locations where it would be appropriate.

187
00:18:54,992 --> 00:19:04,697
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, there is a revived car wash that the zoning board approved that is towards the rear and fronts right on

188
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:11,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Mystic Valley Parkway, so that is actually going, is a little bit further down Mystic Ave.

189
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:20,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can go through these points, so I don't believe, let's see, I'm working with one screen here.

190
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:42,756
[SPEAKER_06]: So to go through the special permit criteria, one, the social and economic community needs which are served by the proposal with this other car wash in the vicinity and Prestige operating another one on Middlesex Ave as well as in many other car washes in our abutting communities.

191
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:49,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that this is a need at this location.

192
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:51,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I think that would be,

193
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:54,272
[SPEAKER_06]: a difficult...

194
00:19:57,608 --> 00:20:01,170
[SPEAKER_06]: criterion to justify being met.

195
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:08,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Traffic flow and safety, this use by its nature generates many vehicular trips.

196
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:23,500
[SPEAKER_06]: As Attorney Dash said, this isn't a destination, but it's actually the number of trips of cars coming to and from quite rapidly and in quick succession.

197
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:26,022
[SPEAKER_06]: That is an issue with keeping

198
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,023
[SPEAKER_06]: the quarter safe for bikes and pedestrians.

199
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:49,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I should mention someone did actually get hit by a car the other location in front so it can be very dangerous some of these properties like or some of these uses such as car washes and gas stations where cars are coming in and out quickly trying to just you know go on their way.

200
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:50,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a use that

201
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:59,702
[SPEAKER_06]: really is important to have the correct sites for them within the zoning districts that they're allowed by right or by special permit.

202
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:12,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Regarding the adequacy of utilities and other public services, I did get some updated information upon request.

203
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:13,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the issues,

204
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:35,169
[SPEAKER_06]: would be reviewed by the engineer upon a building permit or stormwater permit, but there's still some issues of whether there's, you know, the water access, if they're lead pipes, if they could, they'd have to be video camera to make sure that they can support the use, but those would all come later at the building permit stage.

205
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,435
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, the question of whether that is met is kind of up in the air, I'm not sure.

206
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:52,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Regarding whether the compatibility with the size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood, admittedly, it's not the most attractive corridor.

207
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:55,142
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a hodgepodge.

208
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:59,806
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's really nothing that would be compatible.

209
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:04,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say this building isn't compatible either then.

210
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:11,356
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a hodgepodge, but it's not in line with

211
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:28,513
[SPEAKER_06]: the direction that we're trying to go with the comprehensive plan, as I previously mentioned in number six, which is pedestrian-oriented buildings, denser, activated ground floors, residences.

212
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:30,815
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're looking for.

213
00:22:32,236 --> 00:22:33,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Impacts on the natural environment.

214
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:35,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's a fully paved site.

215
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:43,294
[SPEAKER_06]: it's, anything would be an improvement, that's true.

216
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:48,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm glad to see that there would be some trees included on this plan.

217
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:59,158
[SPEAKER_06]: And regarding the performance standards, the aesthetics of the building, it is oriented with the tunnel facing the street.

218
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:06,580
[SPEAKER_06]: The original plan sets that I had actually, I mean, the drawings must have been made for another

219
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:18,875
[SPEAKER_06]: another city or another town because it was oriented with the vacuums in the parking facing Mystic Ave, which isn't actually physically possible because it's a narrow, deep lot.

220
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:33,360
[SPEAKER_06]: So with the tunnel facing Mystic Ave, with the noise and even the signage wouldn't even be directed towards the street.

221
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:36,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say that it doesn't meet that performance standard.

222
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:43,981
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition, the noise, the vacuums, they're deafening.

223
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:45,862
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so loud.

224
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:48,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I measured the sounds of them.

225
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:50,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're all going because they're free.

226
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,006
[SPEAKER_06]: They're included.

227
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:52,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody runs the vacuums.

228
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:55,710
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very loud.

229
00:23:57,295 --> 00:24:07,960
[SPEAKER_06]: So our recommendation is that this special permit, which is discretionary, and no one is entitled to a special permit, we're recommending that this be denied.

230
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:14,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all I have.

231
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:18,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Danielle.

232
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:26,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to open it up before I make my own

233
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,248
[SPEAKER_03]: comments I'm going to open it up for board questions or comments.

234
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:50,417
[SPEAKER_14]: I think at the moment although I would like to uh sorry go ahead okay gotcha I would like to point out uh

235
00:24:51,885 --> 00:25:02,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Counter to Attorney Dash's statement that a car wash is not a destination, I must admit I've never kind of just been going about my daily chores and been like, I'm going to stop and get my car washed.

236
00:25:03,748 --> 00:25:04,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that's just me, but.

237
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Vice Chair Hagedorn?

238
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:18,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're on mute.

239
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:26,370
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're four years into the pandemic and I still don't know how to do virtual meetings, so appreciate that.

240
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,391
[SPEAKER_05]: That heads up there, Chair McPherson.

241
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:35,715
[SPEAKER_05]: While I do sometimes pursue a car wash as a destination, I love getting my car washed.

242
00:25:35,955 --> 00:25:42,119
[SPEAKER_05]: It is relaxing and a very serene and joyful experience for me that I treat myself to.

243
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:48,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have to agree with some of the points that were made by city staff.

244
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:50,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've started to do some really dynamic work

245
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:52,088
[SPEAKER_05]: on Mystic Ave.

246
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:58,371
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some real people and activity-centric uses that have started to populate the corridor.

247
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:15,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just think we need to continue moving in that direction rather than maintain the former status quo of highly industrial automotive uses, which do still have a place in every community.

248
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,242
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the proximity to other car washes, whether they're Prestige or

249
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:32,118
[SPEAKER_05]: other providers, I think that, you know, this location may not be the highest and best use for this location, may not be a car wash at this time.

250
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

251
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:40,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam Behrens?

252
00:26:42,723 --> 00:26:44,824
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more of a question, it might be for the city.

253
00:26:47,401 --> 00:27:13,925
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the proposal is rejected, I just want to better understand whether we're letting the perfect be the enemy of the good and what the timeline would be for a site if we did reject a proposal for that to then continue to be the existing condition for the foreseeable future.

254
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:19,637
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer could very well be.

255
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:21,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to tell.

256
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:27,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, Madam Chair, this is Sal DiStefano, Economic Development Director for the City of Medford.

257
00:27:28,427 --> 00:27:30,989
[SPEAKER_01]: May I address that question?

258
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.

259
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you very much.

260
00:27:39,578 --> 00:27:43,360
[SPEAKER_01]: As it's been mentioned, you know, we're reimagining Mystic Ave.

261
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:47,262
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole city is going through zoning changes.

262
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:49,404
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of positive things happening.

263
00:27:51,365 --> 00:28:06,073
[SPEAKER_01]: My office has been busy fielding calls from developers looking to do mixed-use residential along Mystic Ave and the surrounding area and probably

264
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:19,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that interest is bought by another major business that opened on Mystic Ave that's bringing a lot of people to the area and Great American Beer Hall.

265
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:33,940
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so I guess looking at the current condition and say, okay, well, we're gonna put this car wash here and it's better than what's there now is,

266
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:36,254
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty short-sighted.

267
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:42,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I feel like, you know, Medford shouldn't accept crumbs.

268
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:55,518
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing a lot of interest in the request for proposal that the city issued for the city-owned lots in Medford Square around City Hall.

269
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I have to say, you know, nine jobs

270
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:06,601
[SPEAKER_01]: that probably are not considered living wage jobs.

271
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:10,722
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not conducive to economic development.

272
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:19,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with companies regularly that are looking for staff that probably pay more.

273
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:27,630
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a ladder of where you could go to middle or senior management.

274
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:37,315
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, you know, and, and, you know, with all disclosure, I'm a member of, of prestige.

275
00:29:37,515 --> 00:29:38,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a subscription.

276
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:42,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like going to their car wash at Bedford.

277
00:29:42,718 --> 00:29:48,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's nothing against the gentlemen that are proposing or, um, their attorney.

278
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:55,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just, you know, when we met with them, we said, you know, there are other things you can do here that, um,

279
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:01,501
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, are not a car wash that that the new zoning will allow.

280
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:07,504
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, with all due respect, we disagree on some of the opinions.

281
00:30:07,825 --> 00:30:16,189
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we do, you know, we do want positive things for the community.

282
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:18,070
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all for me.

283
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

284
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just wanted to myself touch on a couple of things that were said earlier.

285
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:27,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them is the fact that it's not by right.

286
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:34,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, it may be better than what's there now, but Sal's piece of final has highlighted perfectly.

287
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:39,615
[SPEAKER_03]: It's method doesn't shouldn't just accept something just because what's there could be better.

288
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the highest, the best or the highest use.

289
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:48,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself have done a lot of work on the comprehensive plan and adopting the comprehensive plan as part of the

290
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:59,527
[SPEAKER_03]: community development board, I just think that Medford deserves, not that a car wash is not right, it's just not, to me, not right for that area.

291
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:06,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't want to be the one to dictate that for the proponent going forward.

292
00:31:06,294 --> 00:31:10,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know that there was so much work that has gone into making that Mystic Ave corridor

293
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:16,100
[SPEAKER_03]: or just getting a little bit more with mixed development and residential uses and so forth.

294
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to continue to go that way.

295
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,781
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my stance.

296
00:31:20,821 --> 00:31:21,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Cowles.

297
00:31:24,142 --> 00:31:24,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Madam Chair.

298
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:27,943
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to touch upon a couple of things that have been said.

299
00:31:28,023 --> 00:31:37,026
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, as Chair McPherson has said, and as Danielle Evans from the city has said,

300
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:40,285
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not a by right use.

301
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:41,706
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a special permit use.

302
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:54,869
[SPEAKER_14]: And a special permit, I mean, this is not a zoning regulation kind of thing where, well, if it checks all the technical boxes, we have to say yes.

303
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:58,010
[SPEAKER_14]: It just has to go here because it checks all those technical boxes.

304
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:03,552
[SPEAKER_14]: The special permit is a process put in place so that this board can review something

305
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,022
[SPEAKER_14]: to determine that it is in conformance with what the city wants to see in that site.

306
00:32:11,122 --> 00:32:13,523
[SPEAKER_14]: And as people have said, with the highest and best use.

307
00:32:14,283 --> 00:32:20,705
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other thing I'd like to touch on is the concept of it being good enough for now.

308
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:30,228
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's something we had a similar proposal from Auto Glass Now over on Harvard Street, where they were

309
00:32:31,013 --> 00:32:40,020
[SPEAKER_14]: going into an existing building, and that was a project that was approved along that kind of line.

310
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:49,787
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was a different situation where they were renovating an existing building, and there was not going to be any change to the site.

311
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:59,995
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was acknowledged at that time that it was unlikely that if, I mean, two or three or five years down the line, if they had come to this board with the same proposal in the same place,

312
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:28,465
[SPEAKER_14]: uh it would likely have not been approved but acknowledging that they were not going to make any changes to the site they were just going to occupy an existing building we did approve that but i don't think in my opinion that this meets quite the same standards thank you vice chairman um i'll pass it to ben because he hasn't said anything yet and then i can i can go after

313
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:43,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just, I agree with everything that's been said, but just to sort of play devil's advocate here a little bit, the proposal is a significant improvement over the current situation.

314
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:54,102
[SPEAKER_09]: And while I am bought in to the long-term zoning overhaul, I believe we're gonna get into that a little bit later.

315
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:57,723
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do agree with the points about

316
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:01,954
[SPEAKER_09]: nine likely low-paying jobs and all the points that have been made.

317
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:10,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I also have, as somebody who commutes from Medford Square to Kendall Square almost daily, I have concerns about the traffic impacts.

318
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:23,410
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that Mr. Dash said that they would be accounted for but Prestige is a very popular car wash and so I would be concerned about traffic backing up onto Mystic Ave and what remediation would be done should that

319
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,062
[SPEAKER_09]: eventually begin to happen as I predict that it would.

320
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:45,153
[SPEAKER_09]: All that being said, a lot of what has been raised sort of against this proposal is based on plans that have been done and hypothetical things that can happen in the future.

321
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:51,336
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm curious to know if there's actually been an analysis done on the alternatives

322
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,872
[SPEAKER_09]: and specifically the economic impact of the alternatives.

323
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:07,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it was Sal from the city, so forgive me if I got that wrong.

324
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:16,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there alternatives that are on the table and viable that create more jobs or better paying jobs?

325
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:20,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to understand the impact on the city's revenues, potentially.

326
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:32,861
[SPEAKER_09]: impacts to tax collection from this proposal versus what's there today versus what some of the alternatives are.

327
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:41,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I just feel like a lot of the arguments against this are anchored in things that are yet to actually be considered.

328
00:35:42,305 --> 00:35:43,846
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to put that out there.

329
00:35:44,457 --> 00:35:46,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I appreciate that.

330
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:53,619
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things I want to keep in mind is that a lot of that information was collected as part of the comprehensive plan that the board has adopted.

331
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:03,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't so much an economic feasibility study and what could be for tax increment or for raising tax there.

332
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:09,422
[SPEAKER_03]: But the comprehensive plan did capture a lot of that, the study that you're looking for, Ben.

333
00:36:13,014 --> 00:36:13,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

334
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:17,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm new to this committee and I'll give it another look.

335
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:17,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

336
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:18,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

337
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:20,702
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're good.

338
00:36:20,942 --> 00:36:21,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it.

339
00:36:23,565 --> 00:36:25,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll toss it over to Ari.

340
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:27,989
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't spoken yet, so before you guys get too much in me.

341
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:32,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Emily.

342
00:36:33,155 --> 00:36:35,597
[SPEAKER_12]: I think unsurprisingly,

343
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,582
[SPEAKER_12]: Sharing many of the opinions of the board.

344
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:46,267
[SPEAKER_12]: I think our responsibility when we're thinking of timeframes is not what is better.

345
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:56,855
[SPEAKER_12]: In 6 to 12 months, I think it is very clear that our responsibility is to be looking at in the like 5 to 10 year range as well.

346
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:11,432
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that even if it is better than being dilapidated this year with the comprehensive plan and revitalization that we heard from the director that there is active interest.

347
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:15,756
[SPEAKER_12]: And from what we've seen on this board, there is that growing interest.

348
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:23,062
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would be very short-sighted of us to allow a kind of very permanent use.

349
00:37:23,102 --> 00:37:23,503
[SPEAKER_12]: This is,

350
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:30,452
[SPEAKER_12]: major building and kind of major infrastructure that would be a huge opportunity cost.

351
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:36,673
[SPEAKER_12]: We want something pedestrian friendly and human friendly in that space.

352
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:48,696
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not just me speaking personally, that's something that the city has adopted through a substantial process and something that can play more of a multifaceted role to benefit

353
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:51,193
[SPEAKER_12]: more people in the community.

354
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:55,116
[SPEAKER_12]: So at this point, that's I'm leaning against it.

355
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:56,576
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are my reasons why.

356
00:37:56,737 --> 00:38:00,319
[SPEAKER_12]: And I appreciate hearing everyone's opinions and perspectives.

357
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,881
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do not take turning down an application lightly.

358
00:38:03,901 --> 00:38:13,527
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly agree with members of the board who have spoken about the importance of economic development and businesses in our community.

359
00:38:13,974 --> 00:38:21,156
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree, I'm thrilled that we keep getting all these businesses wanting to create jobs and excitement.

360
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:25,717
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that these are not many jobs and not the type of excitement we want.

361
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:35,359
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready, Vice Chairman?

362
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:37,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Annie's hand, sorry.

363
00:38:40,797 --> 00:38:42,938
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a public hearing, so I want to get to that.

364
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:46,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I was giving you a chance to jump in.

365
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:47,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll jump in.

366
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:51,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think Peter brought up a great point about the previous applicant.

367
00:38:53,144 --> 00:39:02,529
[SPEAKER_05]: That use was also, you know, that was also a rental of the space.

368
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Attorney Dash, is the applicant also the landowner in this situation?

369
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:11,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they purchased the lot to do a car wash.

370
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:11,977
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all they do.

371
00:39:12,677 --> 00:39:13,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

372
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:14,618
[SPEAKER_05]: They do it very well.

373
00:39:15,578 --> 00:39:28,424
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the other situation, there was a lease sign, and the owner themselves indicated that they were excited about future development opportunities outside of an auto glass repair shop.

374
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:30,305
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that was another differentiator there.

375
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:34,907
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more of a comment or a challenge for the applicant.

376
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:46,289
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, maybe there's a way that a car wash model could be integrated into a really dynamic, you know, urban mixed use facility.

377
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:50,031
[SPEAKER_05]: This could be a really fun opportunity for you all to get very creative.

378
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:57,674
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if car washes are something you do well, then, you know, maybe it's something that you can do well and different here in Medford.

379
00:39:58,034 --> 00:40:02,556
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd encourage you to think about the feedback we're giving and maybe that fits into

380
00:40:03,355 --> 00:40:10,538
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a future model for car washes that could be deployed, you know, broader than just, you know, our fair city of Medford.

381
00:40:11,258 --> 00:40:12,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my two comments.

382
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:13,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Chair.

383
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Annie?

384
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:23,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.

385
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:28,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Very quickly, I just want to reflect on my

386
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:43,894
[SPEAKER_11]: view of McGrath Highway in Cambridge, which 20 years ago was completely carved out as a commercial environment.

387
00:40:44,733 --> 00:41:10,195
[SPEAKER_11]: And through city planning, that entire corridor had evolved into mixed-use apartments with stores underneath and little parks and just improved quality of life for people who live on the side streets that lead into the main corridor.

388
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:31,229
[SPEAKER_11]: I really think it's very important to consider that Mystic Avenue would be a wonderful place to have apartments and small shops and have it as a neighborhood like we have other neighborhoods in Medford.

389
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:33,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

390
00:41:38,698 --> 00:41:39,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

391
00:41:39,478 --> 00:41:57,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna open it up for public comment, but my final comment on this, and then I'll open it up for final comment, is that I have not been convinced that there are, that the actual benefits have outweighed the adverse effects, especially when it comes to transportation and infrastructure for accommodating the car wash in that area.

392
00:41:58,544 --> 00:42:03,566
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am leading towards not approving it for those reasons alone.

393
00:42:03,586 --> 00:42:06,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I will open it up to the public.

394
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I will now open up the public comment period.

395
00:42:11,261 --> 00:42:16,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Daniel in the comments.

396
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:20,584
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also send an email to OCD at myfriend-ma.org.

397
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:24,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

398
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:31,548
[SPEAKER_03]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments, as it is not part of the public record.

399
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:37,890
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat or let myself.

400
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,350
[SPEAKER_03]: and staff.

401
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:45,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

402
00:42:51,353 --> 00:42:55,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, I do not see any hands raised.

403
00:42:58,854 --> 00:43:01,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Participating in Zoom, I can check.

404
00:43:02,964 --> 00:43:05,246
[SPEAKER_06]: that email or inbox.

405
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:08,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't receive any emails prior to the meeting.

406
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:19,158
[SPEAKER_06]: We did get a few calls, you know, asking if this was going to be heard, but no one submitted written comments.

407
00:43:19,238 --> 00:43:22,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia, if you get to the inbox before I do.

408
00:43:22,921 --> 00:43:24,683
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing in the email today.

409
00:43:29,362 --> 00:43:32,964
[SPEAKER_13]: They're only newsletters in the email box from today.

410
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:40,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I will close the public comment period for this meeting.

411
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:53,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, just reiterating that I have not seen proof that the infrastructure can accommodate commercial use such as a car wash, especially with engineering.

412
00:43:55,193 --> 00:44:05,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that you said that it's a possibility, and I know that the proponent has submitted utility plans and so forth, but the stormwater is a huge issue, as well as the transportation circulation there.

413
00:44:05,397 --> 00:44:08,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And although it's currently a fright,

414
00:44:09,419 --> 00:44:16,683
[SPEAKER_03]: uh attorney dash said that it's not a destination site, but as someone has already mentioned, uh, you usually do Writing your calendar.

415
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:19,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get a car wash today or something like that.

416
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:21,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually people will um plan out.

417
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:25,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's how I do it I plan out a day when i'm going to go to a car wash.

418
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:28,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So it usually winds up being a destination at some point.

419
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:35,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Um So when you're saying that i'm going to open it up to the board to do to deliberate at this time

420
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:40,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, at some point, could our team respond to some of this?

421
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:41,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course.

422
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:43,485
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if this is the appropriate moment.

423
00:44:43,505 --> 00:44:44,426
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you may.

424
00:44:45,106 --> 00:44:45,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

425
00:44:45,947 --> 00:44:50,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to let Mr. Shubha address the infrastructure piece.

426
00:44:51,113 --> 00:44:52,975
[SPEAKER_10]: He's more qualified than I am as the engineer.

427
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:55,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I would note, I said people don't make a special trip.

428
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:15,053
[SPEAKER_10]: they they don't drive by your right and go i need a car wash well i guess some people do but it's more or less they're driving by anyway uh... and that's when they're going to get a car wash it's not like they're going to drive from will burn income down to this particular car wash it doesn't generate traffic it's traffic that's already there

429
00:45:15,954 --> 00:45:23,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I know the applicants in a bit of a hard place here because they already bought the property to do a car wash Understanding extends a special permit.

430
00:45:23,536 --> 00:45:33,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that However, I would note that a special permit to be denied would need to be denied using the current special permit criteria Not the proposed uses or better uses.

431
00:45:33,238 --> 00:45:39,240
[SPEAKER_10]: It's this use And these criteria I know danielle and danielle has explained her position on it.

432
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,721
[SPEAKER_10]: We've explained our position on it We respect each other disagree, but respect each other.

433
00:45:43,961 --> 00:45:44,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it.

434
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:45,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Um

435
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:50,004
[SPEAKER_10]: The tunnel facing the street is 44 feet back.

436
00:45:50,265 --> 00:45:53,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that's a massive encroachment on the pedestrian way.

437
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:59,012
[SPEAKER_10]: The building is set way, way back with the trees and the landscaping up against the street there.

438
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:06,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is actually a nicer pedestrian experience, granted on this very small stretch with this whole wasteland of industrial around it.

439
00:46:07,218 --> 00:46:13,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Hal, can you explain, I guess, the utility part that the chair talked about, the infrastructure and accommodating it and traffic impacts and such?

440
00:46:15,171 --> 00:46:24,658
[SPEAKER_10]: You're muted, Hal.

441
00:46:24,758 --> 00:46:25,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, Madam Chair.

442
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:27,721
[SPEAKER_00]: For the record, my name is Hal Chuba.

443
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:35,326
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a consulting engineer in Dartmouth and I am the applicant's engineer.

444
00:46:37,738 --> 00:46:41,001
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you I've been working with the applicants for over 15 years.

445
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:55,193
[SPEAKER_00]: We've designed over 30 car washes through the Boston metropolitan areas, and lots that are smaller than this, where we had more challenges in the city of Boston or the city of

446
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:03,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Malden or in Quincy and traffic is not going to be an issue.

447
00:47:04,397 --> 00:47:11,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Car washes are not traffic destinations and when I mean traffic destination, people are not driving from nearby cities to go wash their cars.

448
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,281
[SPEAKER_00]: They're washing their cars because either they live

449
00:47:15,981 --> 00:47:20,762
[SPEAKER_00]: next to the facility or they work next to the facility and they go by it every day.

450
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:37,486
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not me who's saying this, we have an ITE, according to the ITE trip generation from the traffic engineers, the publications, it tells you that a gas station, car wash,

451
00:47:37,906 --> 00:47:41,707
[SPEAKER_00]: convenience store, coffee shops are not traffic destinations.

452
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:56,652
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you know, and I we looked at this and we to be more conservative, actually, we took data from the applicants, other car washes, and we doubled we get I gave you more conservative numbers.

453
00:47:56,772 --> 00:48:04,034
[SPEAKER_00]: And I demonstrated that there's going to be no impact to the to the street capacity or the level of service on the site.

454
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,235
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the

455
00:48:07,035 --> 00:48:13,724
[SPEAKER_00]: The location of the sighting, you can see from the shape of the lot.

456
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:25,018
[SPEAKER_00]: The lot has a small frontage on Mystic, but although it's deep and the way we sighted the car wash, we can accommodate

457
00:48:26,164 --> 00:48:33,286
[SPEAKER_00]: easily over 22 cars before you get to the street, so by no means there'll be any impacts to the street.

458
00:48:33,886 --> 00:48:37,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you know, I'm just going through the technical or the engineering.

459
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:44,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it's not in line of your vision, what you like to see in the area, but as far as the

460
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:51,380
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure or the utilities.

461
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,884
[SPEAKER_00]: The current location is a commercial site.

462
00:48:55,104 --> 00:48:58,548
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the water connection, it has the sewer connection.

463
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:05,535
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that the water service is a lead pipe

464
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,657
[SPEAKER_00]: By all means, we go through this with every city.

465
00:49:08,697 --> 00:49:11,058
[SPEAKER_00]: We change it to copper, whatever they use now.

466
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,379
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to upgrade the site.

467
00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:19,261
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to bring everything up to code, up to whether it's stormwater or utilities.

468
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:20,762
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have the capacity.

469
00:49:20,882 --> 00:49:25,164
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't require a lot of water usage because we do

470
00:49:26,084 --> 00:49:32,405
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a recycling system on site that recycle 80% of the water that we use in the car wash.

471
00:49:32,885 --> 00:49:33,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the sewer.

472
00:49:34,446 --> 00:49:36,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever we use, we recycle.

473
00:49:36,986 --> 00:49:46,368
[SPEAKER_00]: A little over goes to the sewer system, so it's not going to be a tax on your treatment plants or any impact.

474
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,029
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the stormwater,

475
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:56,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised, really, to see that the staff report said there's nothing about stormwater.

476
00:49:56,691 --> 00:50:01,073
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought stormwater was the biggest improvement we offered to this site.

477
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:06,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, there are no stormwater collection system on site.

478
00:50:06,934 --> 00:50:13,256
[SPEAKER_00]: All the water sheet flows to a catch basin and then it's direct discharge to the municipal system with no treatment.

479
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:14,337
[SPEAKER_00]: With this

480
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:39,495
[SPEAKER_00]: With our design, we propose to collect all the water from the site by a closed drainage system to treat it and then send it to an infiltration system to hold the first one inch of runoff on site in compliance with Massachusetts DEP standards and Medford stormwater management.

481
00:50:40,275 --> 00:50:41,556
[SPEAKER_00]: We had provided a full

482
00:50:43,724 --> 00:50:50,652
[SPEAKER_00]: grading and drainage plan with details on the system that we propose to use with details.

483
00:50:50,812 --> 00:51:03,406
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if it made it to the city engineer's office or not, but I see in the report that there was a mentioning of no utilities or stormwater on site.

484
00:51:04,547 --> 00:51:13,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we think because of the nature of the setting currently, and again, I understand what's your vision for the future.

485
00:51:13,598 --> 00:51:24,010
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility is going to be sandwiched or surrounded by similar uses, and it's an improvement to what's there now.

486
00:51:25,508 --> 00:51:31,489
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that we meet all the criteria for a special permit based on the current zoning.

487
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:34,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to the future, what could be there.

488
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:46,132
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm not sure if the site is a perfect fit or suitable for residential being so close to 93, but again, that's not for me to make the call.

489
00:51:46,652 --> 00:51:50,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those are my comments.

490
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,053
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can answer any questions, I'll be glad to.

491
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:53,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

492
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:56,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Hal.

493
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,401
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what else to say.

494
00:51:59,421 --> 00:52:02,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I gather the tenor of the board.

495
00:52:02,722 --> 00:52:03,403
[SPEAKER_10]: We understand.

496
00:52:03,423 --> 00:52:05,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it.

497
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:10,886
[SPEAKER_10]: However, as I said, this isn't a bad situation.

498
00:52:10,926 --> 00:52:11,787
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a bad use.

499
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,648
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not an ugly thing that we're doing.

500
00:52:13,688 --> 00:52:14,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a very tough site.

501
00:52:15,088 --> 00:52:18,970
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, sandwiched between 93 and Mystic Avenue.

502
00:52:19,651 --> 00:52:21,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe someday someone's going to redevelop this whole site.

503
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:22,932
[SPEAKER_10]: But you saw the photographs.

504
00:52:23,012 --> 00:52:23,753
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot.

505
00:52:24,972 --> 00:52:26,314
[SPEAKER_10]: it's going to be a long time.

506
00:52:26,494 --> 00:52:32,181
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a use that people, if residential ever does come in, it's something that could serve the residential uses.

507
00:52:32,381 --> 00:52:38,248
[SPEAKER_10]: We've pulled a building back, we've greened up the street front to make it more of a pleasant environment.

508
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,391
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to be this little island in the middle of all this.

509
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:44,873
[SPEAKER_10]: commercial wasteland around it for probably a very long time despite the zoning.

510
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:49,914
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's great that Sal says that there's people, you know, sniffing around.

511
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:50,554
[SPEAKER_10]: That's wonderful.

512
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:54,255
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's a lot down in that area.

513
00:52:54,435 --> 00:53:00,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Mystic Avenue is long and there are parts of Mystic Avenue that I understand that this is not that part of Mystic Avenue.

514
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,138
[SPEAKER_10]: This is probably the grittiest, most industrial piece of it.

515
00:53:05,413 --> 00:53:06,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we all hear you.

516
00:53:06,214 --> 00:53:08,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what else to say.

517
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:11,522
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Danielle and Alisha have their hands up, so I'll stop talking.

518
00:53:12,483 --> 00:53:13,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Attorney Dash.

519
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:14,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Hahn?

520
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

521
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:23,533
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Alicia Hunt, director of planning, development and sustainability for the city.

522
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,538
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought that it was just helpful for me to share a few brief thoughts.

523
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:32,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's in line with what I'm already hearing.

524
00:53:33,763 --> 00:53:40,770
[SPEAKER_13]: But when I look at the social, economic and community needs that are served by this proposal, nine jobs are not a lot.

525
00:53:42,983 --> 00:53:46,484
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't seen anything to show that there are high paying jobs.

526
00:53:46,564 --> 00:53:50,865
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, it's unlikely that they would be living wage jobs.

527
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:56,427
[SPEAKER_13]: And the social bringing to this, the traffic flow and safety.

528
00:53:56,667 --> 00:54:03,889
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that we haven't really addressed is the fact that we do get a lot of bicycles on this corridor and we think we'll be getting more bicycles.

529
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,791
[SPEAKER_13]: We would like to make this a walkable, bikeable neighborhood.

530
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:11,872
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's one thing to say that these vehicles are driving by anyhow,

531
00:54:12,353 --> 00:54:26,143
[SPEAKER_13]: But to have the pulling in and out of this lot 200 vehicles a day or more, I think we saw some numbers that were higher than that, is a very high number to be making these turns.

532
00:54:26,824 --> 00:54:29,646
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'm concerned about pedestrian and bicycle safety.

533
00:54:30,787 --> 00:54:32,028
[SPEAKER_13]: And then just simply the

534
00:54:46,698 --> 00:54:48,399
[SPEAKER_13]: with the city's comprehensive plan.

535
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:54,022
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will note that we have had that this parcel sold very quickly.

536
00:54:55,023 --> 00:54:59,965
[SPEAKER_13]: We were trying to get a hold of the owner as soon as we realized it was for sale and it had already been sold.

537
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:08,670
[SPEAKER_13]: And we do believe that it would not be hard for this property owner to wait probably I'm going to say six weeks

538
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:15,876
[SPEAKER_13]: and sell it at a much higher value because the zoning will allow a much greater, greater, and I can't promise, right?

539
00:55:15,936 --> 00:55:24,763
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't predict, but the new zoning has actually been referred from the city council already to the CD board for a public hearing.

540
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:33,109
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do think that that will increase the value of this lot, and this may be an easy moneymaker for this property owner.

541
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:37,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I can't promise that, but it seems likely to me.

542
00:55:38,374 --> 00:55:38,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

543
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:45,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel Evans.

544
00:55:47,195 --> 00:55:47,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

545
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:56,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the Mystic Avenue corridor district zoning will be before you on the 20th, actually.

546
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:05,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Once that passes, the development potential for this site will be drastically increased.

547
00:56:06,678 --> 00:56:10,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So they could just flip this property and come out ahead.

548
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that that needs to be a concern.

549
00:56:14,303 --> 00:56:30,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to reiterate that it's the exiting and entering of the site, the curb cuts repeatedly in quick succession, because that's how car washes are.

550
00:56:30,252 --> 00:56:34,835
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the concern, not necessarily trips

551
00:56:35,847 --> 00:56:37,889
[SPEAKER_06]: or more cars going down the street.

552
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:40,391
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the coming in and out that's the concern.

553
00:56:41,772 --> 00:56:43,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And last minute, oh, there's a car wash.

554
00:56:44,174 --> 00:56:45,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn in real quick.

555
00:56:45,555 --> 00:56:47,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's when you hit somebody.

556
00:56:47,736 --> 00:56:52,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I said before, it has happened recently at Middlesex Ave.

557
00:56:53,821 --> 00:56:54,422
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a video.

558
00:56:54,762 --> 00:56:57,724
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite horrifying.

559
00:56:59,045 --> 00:56:59,466
[SPEAKER_06]: And also,

560
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:08,313
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea that we shouldn't develop anything because of proximity to 93 is an incredibly pessimistic view.

561
00:57:09,374 --> 00:57:18,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the fault of our city that the federal government decided to clear out neighborhoods cut right through the fells and put in a highway?

562
00:57:18,921 --> 00:57:27,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now because we have a highway that brings millions of commuters through, that now not only do we have that,

563
00:57:28,591 --> 00:57:29,631
[SPEAKER_06]: incredible burden.

564
00:57:30,212 --> 00:57:32,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we can't build near it and shouldn't even try or bother.

565
00:57:32,912 --> 00:57:39,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually pretty offensive that we shouldn't do anything because 93 is right there.

566
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:41,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see it go away someday.

567
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:47,117
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just don't think that that's an argument that would ever sway me.

568
00:57:53,567 --> 00:57:54,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

569
00:57:54,727 --> 00:58:09,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to reiterate that it wasn't, although yes, I definitely would rather see a higher and better use there with all the work that has gone in with the planning staff and the community development board to adopt a comprehensive plan.

570
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:19,655
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing that I've noticed, that I've noted was that I was more concerned with transportation and the inadequate utilities I stand for for the stormwater.

571
00:58:20,486 --> 00:58:27,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have not rectified that and shaken that out, even if you have to take that away, it goes back to the safety of transportation for myself.

572
00:58:28,691 --> 00:58:44,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And Daniel, as I restated, I didn't wanna use that, but there is a car wash on Middlesex Avenue, and I'm not saying it had anything to do with that, but just the way that the cars were in and out of there, I can't imagine that also happening on Mystic Ave with the same flow.

573
00:58:44,902 --> 00:58:46,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where I'm coming from.

574
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:52,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that being said, I will open it up again for board deliberation.

575
00:58:54,057 --> 00:59:02,446
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's any other questions or I'll even ask for a motion to approve or deny the special permit application at this point.

576
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:26,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if I asked my client quickly, normally I would lean over if I were in the room, but that's obviously not been an option for a few years, whether or not they wanted to talk about this further with a continuance or whether they wanted to pursue board vote on a near Ronan.

577
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:31,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to do this sort of in an open meeting, but I kind of have no choice unless you want to email me on this.

578
00:59:34,059 --> 00:59:35,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to say something.

579
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Ronan, can you hear me?

580
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:39,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

581
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:45,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, my name is Ronen Droric and I'm one of the owners of Prestige Cowash.

582
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:50,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So just to go to a few items that, you know, the boys were talking about.

583
00:59:51,053 --> 00:59:56,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So they said nine job is not enough or it's not a lot, but if you build apartment building, there will be zero job.

584
00:59:57,414 --> 00:59:58,134
[SPEAKER_07]: That's number one.

585
00:59:59,034 --> 01:00:03,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two is the average cowash operator that worked for us make about $75,000.

586
01:00:03,055 --> 01:00:04,436
[SPEAKER_07]: A manager could make well over $100,000.

587
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:05,876
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's well paying jobs.

588
01:00:11,085 --> 01:00:18,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the noise is absolutely no issue because the way we design it, we take everything into consideration.

589
01:00:18,669 --> 01:00:21,250
[SPEAKER_07]: The cars will exit towards 93.

590
01:00:22,351 --> 01:00:23,971
[SPEAKER_07]: So all the blowers will be towards 93.

591
01:00:24,572 --> 01:00:27,773
[SPEAKER_07]: So obviously 93 will be much louder than the blowers.

592
01:00:28,274 --> 01:00:32,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So you will only see the cars entering when you're on mystic Avenue.

593
01:00:32,115 --> 01:00:36,017
[SPEAKER_07]: So that really kind of pretty much answer that question.

594
01:00:37,558 --> 01:00:39,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, and, uh,

595
01:00:42,343 --> 01:00:49,945
[SPEAKER_07]: What the other thing is that it could take over 10 years to, I mean, we did a lot of development over the years for the last 30 years.

596
01:00:50,145 --> 01:00:53,186
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be over 10 years before anything get developed in that area.

597
01:00:53,766 --> 01:00:59,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I did talk to a few people on the, on mystic Avenue and none of them are interested to sell.

598
01:00:59,148 --> 01:01:03,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you give him 10 million, you can go to the body shop next door and offer him $10 million.

599
01:01:03,349 --> 01:01:05,850
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not going to sell his business and he just doesn't want to sell.

600
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:10,751
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go to the, uh, the one on the right of us, which is the, uh,

601
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,002
[SPEAKER_07]: the shingle place, you know, the roofing place, they're not selling the place.

602
01:01:16,042 --> 01:01:20,624
[SPEAKER_07]: So here is three buildings between us that not going to sell and you can keep going on and on and on.

603
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:29,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could change the zoning, but if the people that own it run a business out of it and they have no place to go, they will not participate.

604
01:01:29,309 --> 01:01:31,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you give them $10 million, it will just not do it.

605
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:38,013
[SPEAKER_07]: So as of right now, the current zoning is allowed us to do what we applied to do.

606
01:01:38,772 --> 01:01:41,454
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been in this business for over 20 years.

607
01:01:41,474 --> 01:01:43,475
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been developing over 30 years.

608
01:01:43,556 --> 01:01:50,420
[SPEAKER_07]: We've built apartments, we've built townhouses, we've built houses, we've developed a gas station, car washes, commercial, residential.

609
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:52,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are very familiar with the development.

610
01:01:52,882 --> 01:01:55,304
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very familiar with the value of property.

611
01:01:55,845 --> 01:02:00,330
[SPEAKER_07]: But what happened here right now between everything that you say, it's actually not true.

612
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:06,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I did sue in the past other towns for not letting us open locations.

613
01:02:06,836 --> 01:02:09,099
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can tell you that we always win.

614
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason that we win is because a special permit was meant to be given.

615
01:02:14,504 --> 01:02:17,708
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at the definition, and you can go and ask any lawyer or judge,

616
01:02:18,898 --> 01:02:20,439
[SPEAKER_07]: It's meant to be given with conditions.

617
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:23,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So we meet all the zoning criteria.

618
01:02:23,802 --> 01:02:25,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually meet all the setbacks.

619
01:02:25,443 --> 01:02:26,543
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need any variance.

620
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:32,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, the only jurisdiction that you have on us is just to give us conditions that you're not happy with.

621
01:02:33,448 --> 01:02:35,089
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's hours of operation.

622
01:02:35,608 --> 01:02:46,076
[SPEAKER_07]: or any traffic if you see any, but you really cannot, I mean, you can deny it, but no judge would actually side with you, just so you know.

623
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:50,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, you can deny the meeting tonight and not vote for it.

624
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Legally, we are allowed to do it.

625
01:02:52,961 --> 01:02:55,902
[SPEAKER_07]: A special permit was meant to be given with conditions.

626
01:02:56,282 --> 01:02:58,442
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not meant to be denied.

627
01:02:58,763 --> 01:03:06,265
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was meant to be denied, you would just not be allowed to do it on the zoning chart.

628
01:03:06,405 --> 01:03:07,565
[SPEAKER_07]: It would just be not allowed.

629
01:03:07,965 --> 01:03:09,306
[SPEAKER_07]: It's allowed by special permit.

630
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:11,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And we meet every criteria on that.

631
01:03:14,212 --> 01:03:15,153
[SPEAKER_07]: on the zoning book.

632
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:26,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And we made everything, if it's noise, if it's traffic, if it's the height, if it's the setback, if it's the traffic circulation, if it's the noise, anything that, you know, you can throw at us.

633
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:31,260
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually put a lot of thought, a lot of money and a lot of engineering into it.

634
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:37,903
[SPEAKER_07]: And we design it in a way that this will not interrupt with any of the traffic on Mystic Avenue.

635
01:03:38,283 --> 01:03:39,544
[SPEAKER_07]: The noise will be facing

636
01:03:41,263 --> 01:03:42,544
[SPEAKER_07]: excuse me, route 93.

637
01:03:43,044 --> 01:03:46,706
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, the building on the left, the building on the right are going nowhere.

638
01:03:46,886 --> 01:03:48,808
[SPEAKER_07]: There's three or four more buildings that I talked to.

639
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:51,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody's interested to do anything there.

640
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:53,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not that it's going to stay the way it is.

641
01:03:53,711 --> 01:04:01,095
[SPEAKER_07]: But this could take 10, 15, 20 years before, as I always said, at one point, which happened to us, owners die.

642
01:04:01,475 --> 01:04:03,497
[SPEAKER_07]: If the guy is 70 or 80 years old, he's dying.

643
01:04:03,537 --> 01:04:05,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Then his kids basically will sell the property.

644
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:08,050
[SPEAKER_07]: But we don't have the time to wait for that.

645
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:11,310
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the business we run in, and that's what we want to do with the property.

646
01:04:12,911 --> 01:04:19,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Ronan, without getting into all of that, I mean, would you like the board to vote tonight, or do you want to ask the continuance to discuss?

647
01:04:19,473 --> 01:04:19,713
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

648
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:20,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I want them to vote.

649
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:21,133
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

650
01:04:21,533 --> 01:04:21,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

651
01:04:22,073 --> 01:04:22,734
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my question.

652
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:35,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that said, to reiterate, a special permit is not by right.

653
01:04:37,931 --> 01:04:40,573
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can be meant to be it's meant to be given with condition.

654
01:04:40,713 --> 01:04:41,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Just that's all I'm saying.

655
01:04:41,854 --> 01:04:42,575
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not by right.

656
01:04:42,595 --> 01:04:43,436
[SPEAKER_07]: You're absolutely right.

657
01:04:43,876 --> 01:04:45,698
[SPEAKER_07]: It's meant to be given with conditions.

658
01:04:46,418 --> 01:04:51,222
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the meeting and allow you guys by chair.

659
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:52,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

660
01:04:58,008 --> 01:05:02,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking for a motion to approve or deny the special permit application.

661
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:09,906
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to hear from Danielle, who had her hand raised before the motion.

662
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:14,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, may I?

663
01:05:15,409 --> 01:05:15,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

664
01:05:17,149 --> 01:05:22,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to counter the assertion that special permits are meant to be given, but with conditions.

665
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:27,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's confusing that with site plan review, which are by right uses.

666
01:05:27,995 --> 01:05:31,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you condition away any detrimental impacts.

667
01:05:31,516 --> 01:05:33,217
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the case with a special permit.

668
01:05:36,027 --> 01:05:38,449
[SPEAKER_06]: They are completely discretionary.

669
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:51,138
[SPEAKER_06]: They are for uses that could be allowed in a zoning district under various circumstances if it meets the criteria.

670
01:05:51,879 --> 01:06:04,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Fronting on Mystic Ave in a specific location we find is not appropriate and does not meet the criteria for issuing a special permit if it was off of

671
01:06:06,225 --> 01:06:13,189
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was a different parcel, it possibly could be appropriate.

672
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:21,514
[SPEAKER_06]: But this particular lot, we don't find it to meet the criterion.

673
01:06:21,554 --> 01:06:26,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And a special permit is not meant to be granted in just this condition.

674
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,337
[SPEAKER_06]: That is actually false.

675
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:31,899
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not on your zoning board.

676
01:06:31,919 --> 01:06:33,180
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't say on your zoning board.

677
01:06:44,496 --> 01:06:46,638
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, I cannot hear Mr. Jory.

678
01:06:46,658 --> 01:06:48,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Did someone mute him or did he mute himself?

679
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody must.

680
01:06:53,302 --> 01:06:54,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody's keep muting me.

681
01:07:00,126 --> 01:07:07,028
[SPEAKER_12]: While it was not me muting him, I will note that speakers are supposed to be recognized by Madam Chair before speaking.

682
01:07:07,548 --> 01:07:13,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Mr. Jory, you can definitely go ahead and speak, but there's no one on our end muting you.

683
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:19,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep pressing unmute, but it's not muting me right now.

684
01:07:19,332 --> 01:07:20,392
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can, can you hear me?

685
01:07:20,813 --> 01:07:21,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we can hear you.

686
01:07:23,153 --> 01:07:23,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

687
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:28,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can tell you that, you know, again, we did go to court

688
01:07:29,324 --> 01:07:33,908
[SPEAKER_07]: over the years, it's not, it's not the first time, you know.

689
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:44,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can tell you that every time we went to court over anything like that, we always win, because it's allowed by special permit.

690
01:07:44,838 --> 01:07:48,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And the special permit was meant to be given with condition scrub it up.

691
01:07:49,623 --> 01:07:51,985
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that just got approved off of Mr. cab.

692
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:53,789
[SPEAKER_07]: was grandfathered in.

693
01:07:54,169 --> 01:07:55,250
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not in the right zone.

694
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:58,192
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he, our place is in the right zone.

695
01:07:58,272 --> 01:08:03,775
[SPEAKER_07]: So that location is, if anything, he's in the wrong place and should not be there.

696
01:08:04,136 --> 01:08:09,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Our location is allowed by special permit and should be allowed to go forward.

697
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:14,082
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just pretty much not allowing us to go forward because you have different vision.

698
01:08:14,462 --> 01:08:20,086
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're not, you're denying my permit because you have a vision, not because there is anything else.

699
01:08:20,246 --> 01:08:21,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just because of your vision.

700
01:08:23,815 --> 01:08:29,098
[SPEAKER_07]: And if nothing is going to change on that road for the next 20 years, where is the vision?

701
01:08:29,158 --> 01:08:30,118
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just your vision.

702
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:33,060
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot control Mystic Ave.

703
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:38,923
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't tomorrow say, okay, I'm going to go and I can close all those businesses and we're going to build apartments.

704
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:43,705
[SPEAKER_07]: If nobody's going to sell and nobody's going to develop it, it's going to stay the same thing for the next 20 years.

705
01:08:44,465 --> 01:08:47,427
[SPEAKER_07]: So your vision really is just a vision.

706
01:08:47,447 --> 01:08:49,668
[SPEAKER_07]: It cannot be

707
01:08:50,867 --> 01:09:06,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Developed unless somebody starts selling and somebody start building Or changing the status quo and saying that I will actually I cannot give the motion, but I will ask for who is ready to deny uh Can we go with that?

708
01:09:06,551 --> 01:09:11,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it isn't is anyone going to deny or Are there any hands for that?

709
01:09:14,073 --> 01:09:14,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes

710
01:09:16,951 --> 01:09:20,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I am going to do a roll call for denying the special motion.

711
01:09:21,253 --> 01:09:24,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do a roll call for denying them.

712
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:28,596
[SPEAKER_13]: If someone can actually call on Emily to make a motion.

713
01:09:28,876 --> 01:09:29,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

714
01:09:30,696 --> 01:09:30,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

715
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:44,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on all the theoreticals we've been talking about tonight between zoning lawsuits death, as well as the decorum, I'm going to call for a denial of this special permit.

[SPEAKER_03]: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm aye.

760
01:11:48,582 --> 01:11:53,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And number three, I want to ask the planning staff to provide a status update for the zoning updates.

761
01:11:58,209 --> 01:12:16,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Chair, so in addition to what we've already commented on, so Planner Evans is in the process of getting the zoning for Mystic Ave formally scheduled and advertised to be for the public hearing open on November 20th.

762
01:12:17,964 --> 01:12:24,468
[SPEAKER_13]: If you need one second, I just want to click on my notes to give you.

763
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:37,676
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've been working with the council and the council president and vice president and the planning consultants to do a plan for the rest of the year.

764
01:12:38,737 --> 01:12:42,179
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're still working out the nitty gritty of the plan.

765
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:52,444
[SPEAKER_13]: but it is our intention that the public hearings for Mr. Gav will occur on November 20th and then December 3rd at city council.

766
01:12:52,744 --> 01:13:02,889
[SPEAKER_13]: If this board hears it in one meeting, if this board chooses to take two meetings, they would open on December 3rd and then continue waiting for your comments on December 17th.

767
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:05,830
[SPEAKER_13]: We're doing it that way just so that they don't

768
01:13:08,745 --> 01:13:13,106
[SPEAKER_13]: have scheduled it for December 17th, and they could have heard it earlier.

769
01:13:13,206 --> 01:13:16,386
[SPEAKER_13]: And now they've pushed it to the last meeting of the new year of the year.

770
01:13:16,406 --> 01:13:20,147
[SPEAKER_13]: So that gives them the opportunity to potentially hear both times.

771
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:27,568
[SPEAKER_13]: We are also working through the nitty gritty of a green score that we'd like to include in zoning.

772
01:13:28,189 --> 01:13:32,069
[SPEAKER_13]: We're working through some of the details of that before it comes forward.

773
01:13:32,429 --> 01:13:35,750
[SPEAKER_13]: But we do think that that will come forward either in

774
01:13:36,677 --> 01:13:40,078
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll either get referred out in December or in January.

775
01:13:40,818 --> 01:13:46,200
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can work it through over the next week or two, it may even get referred out in November.

776
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,541
[SPEAKER_13]: We start to be short on actual meeting times.

777
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:54,643
[SPEAKER_13]: We are also gonna see some draft zoning for Salem Street.

778
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:58,424
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna look at some drafts in some meetings

779
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:16,736
[SPEAKER_13]: November, but we're planning to actually make it clear to the public that December 3rd will be a city council subcommittee meeting before the regular council meeting to hear to see Salem Street and to show it to the public, ask them to submit public comment.

780
01:14:17,076 --> 01:14:18,958
[SPEAKER_13]: That meeting will be limited to one hour.

781
01:14:19,058 --> 01:14:25,263
[SPEAKER_13]: So if public have comment, then we're gonna ask them to either send it in writing or hold it to this December 11th, wait,

782
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:30,156
[SPEAKER_13]: to the city council for the December 17th meeting.

783
01:14:30,176 --> 01:14:30,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh December 11th.

784
01:14:30,937 --> 01:14:34,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Planning subcommittee meeting where we'll take public comment on Salem Street.

785
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:40,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Our goal would be to get comments before that, if at all possible, they're hoping to actually report out Salem Street.

786
01:14:41,582 --> 01:14:49,306
[SPEAKER_13]: From the committee to the City Council for the December 17th meeting, so it may actually get reported out December 17th.

787
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:49,987
[SPEAKER_13]: So this board

788
01:14:55,213 --> 01:15:00,636
[SPEAKER_13]: The board is then, we're just working through an email, a schedule for the spring.

789
01:15:00,656 --> 01:15:05,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Our intention is to have a section of the city for each month.

790
01:15:07,179 --> 01:15:11,021
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, let me give you a quick preview of that.

791
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:15,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, bear with me for one second.

792
01:15:16,503 --> 01:15:18,344
[SPEAKER_13]: I should have had it up, I apologize.

793
01:15:18,524 --> 01:15:23,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, because I switched into our other email box.

794
01:15:24,871 --> 01:15:32,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so very, very tentatively, what we're looking to do is in January, look at housing.

795
01:15:33,134 --> 01:15:36,695
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been putting some new housing definitions into the zoning.

796
01:15:36,715 --> 01:15:42,136
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll see some additional definitions coming with, um, the Mystic, Mystic Ave corridor.

797
01:15:42,156 --> 01:15:52,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but in January to actually look at the SF one and two in general residential districts thinking about, um, one, two and three family housing and ADUs.

798
01:15:54,255 --> 01:16:00,915
[SPEAKER_13]: and specifically to look at North Medford in February, to look at South Medford and Hillside.

799
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:05,419
[SPEAKER_13]: and to start thinking about Medford Square.

800
01:16:05,919 --> 01:16:09,600
[SPEAKER_13]: The intention is to do Medford Square zoning in March.

801
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:16,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is all when the city council subcommittee or city council committee will be looking at them.

802
01:16:16,921 --> 01:16:26,924
[SPEAKER_13]: So if things get reported out for zoning changes, they'd probably come a couple of weeks later, but this is when we'll be really chewing on them in public meeting.

803
01:16:28,704 --> 01:16:32,265
[SPEAKER_13]: The intention of Medford Square being in March is

804
01:16:33,162 --> 01:16:35,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, let me go through the rest of it and then I'll circle back to that.

805
01:16:35,803 --> 01:16:38,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Then April, looking at West Medford.

806
01:16:39,404 --> 01:16:45,925
[SPEAKER_13]: In May, talking about Wellington Glenwood and any additional cleanups and fixes.

807
01:16:46,525 --> 01:17:01,089
[SPEAKER_13]: So some of what will need to happen is that we're gonna do some things, make some changes in a district that in the long run we think should be zoning wide, but we don't wanna break the existing zoning in the meantime.

808
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:03,551
[SPEAKER_13]: So things will go into separate districts.

809
01:17:04,111 --> 01:17:19,085
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when we get to the end, we'll actually do just some cleanup where we pull some things out and say now that we've rezoned everything, this is a city wide thing, not just for those zones, because you don't want to break the existing zoning in the meantime.

810
01:17:20,077 --> 01:17:27,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, some other things that we want to fit into this is looking at the city's tree ordinance and how that fits in with zoning.

811
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:29,742
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have an adopted tree ordinance.

812
01:17:29,802 --> 01:17:32,504
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one that the council's been working on for many years.

813
01:17:33,564 --> 01:17:41,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and another one is looking at, um, TDMs and transportation demand management and transportation.

814
01:17:42,109 --> 01:17:48,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, some of that timing is because, so the parcels in Medford Square are out for RFP.

815
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:55,575
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that we have said with that is that the developers should not look at current zoning.

816
01:17:55,715 --> 01:18:01,102
[SPEAKER_13]: That current zoning is broken and that it is our intention that either

817
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:11,348
[SPEAKER_13]: the zoning will get changed to reflect what we want to see there, or it may make sense to do a planned development district for those specific buildings.

818
01:18:11,889 --> 01:18:13,951
[SPEAKER_13]: It may be that it's a combination of both.

819
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:17,555
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we'd like to do is see what the developers are proposing.

820
01:18:17,575 --> 01:18:20,138
[SPEAKER_13]: The RFP is due December 20th.

821
01:18:21,259 --> 01:18:26,140
[SPEAKER_13]: reflect on that and say, this is what people think they can actually do here in the square.

822
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:29,001
[SPEAKER_13]: How do we think about that for zoning?

823
01:18:29,662 --> 01:18:36,684
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the timing of Medford Square zoning being in March is because in January, we will review the proposals.

824
01:18:37,484 --> 01:18:40,065
[SPEAKER_13]: We will interview developers as needed.

825
01:18:40,665 --> 01:18:44,466
[SPEAKER_13]: In February, we'll probably be working through the initial contracting.

826
01:18:45,128 --> 01:18:52,470
[SPEAKER_13]: and that gives us some time for February for our consultants to look at these proposals and say, what do we want to learn from these proposals?

827
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:55,670
[SPEAKER_13]: What's realistic for Medford Square zoning?

828
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:59,831
[SPEAKER_13]: And then propose, put forward the Medford Square zoning in March.

829
01:19:02,212 --> 01:19:10,894
[SPEAKER_13]: In a perfect kind of world, this board and city council would adopt zoning that would allow those projects to go forward as of right.

830
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:14,575
[SPEAKER_13]: That may not actually make the most sense because it may be

831
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:18,912
[SPEAKER_13]: that what we wanna allow on those parcels, we don't wanna allow in the entire square.

832
01:19:19,312 --> 01:19:25,556
[SPEAKER_13]: So it may be that we also need to either do a sub-district or we may need to do a plan development district for these parcels.

833
01:19:26,696 --> 01:19:32,279
[SPEAKER_13]: But we honestly feel that we need to see what the proposals are first before we make any decisions.

834
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:37,502
[SPEAKER_13]: So we said, let's just put that down and come back to that when we have proposals on the table.

835
01:19:39,098 --> 01:19:44,320
[SPEAKER_13]: We've pushed West Medford closer to the end because we are also starting right now.

836
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:51,142
[SPEAKER_13]: We got an earmark from the state a while ago that we've just managed to contract for.

837
01:19:52,142 --> 01:20:06,166
[SPEAKER_13]: We have hired the Donahue Institute, which is a quasi-state group out of UMass to do a SWOT, strengths, weaknesses,

838
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:16,824
[SPEAKER_13]: opportunities SWOT analysis of the city with economic development, but very specifically focusing on West Medford and West Medford Square.

839
01:20:17,124 --> 01:20:21,785
[SPEAKER_13]: The earmark was supposed to be for West Medford Square economic development analysis.

840
01:20:22,845 --> 01:20:26,866
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is just, we just had the kickoff meeting for that last week.

841
01:20:27,326 --> 01:20:34,647
[SPEAKER_13]: So we wanna give that some time for that group to start doing some work in order to inform

842
01:20:35,217 --> 01:20:37,479
[SPEAKER_13]: the zoning that gets proposed for West Medford.

843
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:44,124
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's sort of why that one is that the West Medford coming at the end is very logical.

844
01:20:44,184 --> 01:20:53,090
[SPEAKER_13]: If you know that we have a study that is kicking off right now on that area and Medford Square in March because of the timing of the RFP.

845
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,773
[SPEAKER_13]: And honestly, there's a lot of interest in looking at the housing.

846
01:20:58,044 --> 01:21:07,292
[SPEAKER_13]: The new ADU law goes into effect in February, but we are still waiting for guidance and regulations from the state on it.

847
01:21:08,373 --> 01:21:12,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand that some of the language is conflicting and confusing.

848
01:21:13,517 --> 01:21:20,362
[SPEAKER_13]: At first pass, it doesn't seem that way, and then you realize that there are ways to read what was actually in the law that

849
01:21:21,357 --> 01:21:23,938
[SPEAKER_13]: don't necessarily make sense the way it's written.

850
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:31,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, you could interpret it to say that you could put an ADU on a commercial business, commercial building, which doesn't quite make logical sense.

851
01:21:31,961 --> 01:21:39,524
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're waiting for some clarifications to come out on that before we go too, too far on our own side with it.

852
01:21:39,664 --> 01:21:42,045
[SPEAKER_13]: But we're not going to wait past January on that.

853
01:21:42,923 --> 01:21:44,664
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where things stand.

854
01:21:44,904 --> 01:21:46,725
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like that was a big dump.

855
01:21:47,305 --> 01:21:57,691
[SPEAKER_13]: As we finalize this calendar, it is the goal of the city to put out some press with the whole timeline mapping out all of the months.

856
01:21:58,951 --> 01:22:04,274
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we're just doing a little back and forth in email to make sure we're all on the same page.

857
01:22:05,255 --> 01:22:09,317
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it is our goal soon in the next,

858
01:22:10,571 --> 01:22:11,932
[SPEAKER_13]: This is one of the things we're working out.

859
01:22:13,493 --> 01:22:18,597
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the members of the group thought we were putting out the press release in December, and I thought we were putting it out next week.

860
01:22:18,617 --> 01:22:27,202
[SPEAKER_13]: So we just need to figure out some of this timing, but we want to publicize that you all are having a public hearing on Mr. Gav.

861
01:22:27,302 --> 01:22:33,947
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want that to be a secret, and that we're doing the meetings on these other meetings so people can participate.

862
01:22:35,157 --> 01:22:41,608
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll just circle all the way back to say, I actually met with, I had a coffee with the Chamber of Commerce last week.

863
01:22:42,406 --> 01:22:45,027
[SPEAKER_13]: and talked extensively about Mystic Ave zoning.

864
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:52,789
[SPEAKER_13]: And there were several Mystic Ave businesses at that meeting who we had like some good conversations about it.

865
01:22:53,189 --> 01:23:02,751
[SPEAKER_13]: And I encouraged them to watch the meeting that we had that night about it and to pay attention and to provide us any comments and feedback.

866
01:23:03,171 --> 01:23:08,813
[SPEAKER_13]: And I offered all of them that if they didn't wanna speak publicly on it, they're always welcome to email me directly.

867
01:23:09,778 --> 01:23:17,281
[SPEAKER_13]: And they should state if they prefer their business name isn't associated with it, but that we do talk to developers all the time.

868
01:23:19,262 --> 01:23:22,263
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm hoping that some of them will give us feedback.

869
01:23:22,383 --> 01:23:26,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we don't hear from them, we talk to them about it.

870
01:23:27,505 --> 01:23:28,245
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're trying to.

871
01:23:30,366 --> 01:23:30,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions?

872
01:23:32,425 --> 01:23:38,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a quick question and just something going back to what Ben had mentioned earlier.

873
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:50,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any ways where a newer board member can just get caught up to some of the things that the city has been visioning without having to tackle the comprehensive plan?

874
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:52,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously, you want to start there, right?

875
01:23:52,971 --> 01:23:57,133
[SPEAKER_03]: But just to be able to know what the visions from the city are, is there any...

876
01:23:58,331 --> 01:24:03,694
[SPEAKER_03]: in how the city plans and thinks and things like that when it comes to the Mystic Ave corridor?

877
01:24:04,334 --> 01:24:06,975
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do have copies of the comprehensive plan.

878
01:24:07,015 --> 01:24:18,941
[SPEAKER_13]: And if it's easier to actually flip through a book and look at some maps and the pictures and stuff, we don't give them out to the public because they literally cost us $50 a piece to print.

879
01:24:19,462 --> 01:24:21,943
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm happy to give them to members of the board.

880
01:24:22,783 --> 01:24:25,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think that you need to know what it says.

881
01:24:25,445 --> 01:24:30,708
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you work better from like flipping through it, I will tell you, I have a copy on my desk.

882
01:24:31,568 --> 01:24:36,811
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't remember what it's oh, sorry, this is my tabbed up one here is the climate plan.

883
01:24:37,471 --> 01:24:39,772
[SPEAKER_13]: I also have copies of the climate plan.

884
01:24:40,813 --> 01:24:44,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, same, same thing that I can provide if that's helpful.

885
01:24:47,883 --> 01:24:52,807
[SPEAKER_13]: We did put together a webpage on zoning, but it doesn't have a ton, ton.

886
01:24:52,967 --> 01:24:56,589
[SPEAKER_13]: It does have, it has how zoning is made in Medford video.

887
01:24:56,790 --> 01:25:01,533
[SPEAKER_13]: If anybody's curious, if you haven't seen it, it's adorable.

888
01:25:02,374 --> 01:25:05,736
[SPEAKER_13]: And the voice is one of the staff in our office.

889
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:08,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, let me drop the URL.

890
01:25:08,798 --> 01:25:15,083
[SPEAKER_13]: So for anybody, it's the city's webpage, medfordma.org.

891
01:25:16,846 --> 01:25:18,767
[SPEAKER_13]: or slash zoning.

892
01:25:19,867 --> 01:25:29,090
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you go there, and the first thing on there is this video about how zoning is made in Medford that was made as part of the comprehensive plan process.

893
01:25:33,052 --> 01:25:34,572
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to talk with people.

894
01:25:34,732 --> 01:25:40,134
[SPEAKER_13]: I do a lot of hand-waving with developers and like, this is what we're thinking here and there.

895
01:25:40,954 --> 01:25:41,815
[SPEAKER_13]: It can be a lot.

896
01:25:44,687 --> 01:25:46,451
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one thing that might be helpful.

897
01:25:46,491 --> 01:25:48,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, Danielle, you had the experience with Somerville.

898
01:25:50,958 --> 01:26:18,023
[SPEAKER_02]: just hearing like the firsthand experience of just similar kind of cities that had like an industrial quarter or like an industrial zone, they went through sort of a comprehensive plan, they wanted to make this big change, and just kind of like what that like that like that awkward sort of sequencing of that like couple of years maybe, where you kind of have the the remnants of what it was,

899
01:26:18,978 --> 01:26:25,842
[SPEAKER_02]: the re-pivot to what we want it to be, and just what we should expect in terms of what is that timeline?

900
01:26:26,102 --> 01:26:27,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a couple of years?

901
01:26:28,343 --> 01:26:29,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that five years?

902
01:26:31,385 --> 01:26:38,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that really looking for an anchor that's going to change the narrative of the street?

903
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:47,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little talk over from somebody that's seen that play out would be the most helpful for me beyond any hard stats or anything.

904
01:26:49,772 --> 01:26:55,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it's like urban planning is really about the long game.

905
01:26:55,354 --> 01:27:05,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And you do these small little wins when you see some tangible results of the planning.

906
01:27:05,538 --> 01:27:11,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's why when you're in planning school, you fantasize about just going to China and planning these.

907
01:27:12,913 --> 01:27:15,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Communities from the ground up, but that's not really how it works here.

908
01:27:15,455 --> 01:27:19,398
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like people like what are you planning?

909
01:27:19,598 --> 01:27:28,645
[SPEAKER_06]: It's built ever changing and um, it takes it takes a while for things and I mean I was in Somerville and I think ben you're from Somerville.

910
01:27:28,665 --> 01:27:35,731
[SPEAKER_06]: You've seen so many changes, right and um when attorney dash was talking about how You know, he'd be before the boards

911
01:27:36,215 --> 01:27:47,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going by two different zoning sets I was actually on that board when he was always in front of us and having to reconcile the existing code and the new code which was going to be approved any day now and it took seven years.

912
01:27:50,815 --> 01:28:03,504
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a while, but then usually there's one good catalyst development that can kind of like set the ball rolling and generating excitement for that.

913
01:28:03,624 --> 01:28:17,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess I'm an optimist and things can move slow and COVID doesn't help, but hopefully things are starting to normalize.

914
01:28:17,034 --> 01:28:18,275
[SPEAKER_06]: So it takes a little time.

915
01:28:20,124 --> 01:28:26,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Zoning is the framework to implement the vision of the comprehensive plan.

916
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:30,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So doing it in the right order, it does take some time.

917
01:28:30,954 --> 01:28:33,436
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely needs to be a patient person.

918
01:28:34,457 --> 01:28:37,920
[SPEAKER_03]: And then having a strong vision, that also comes along with that.

919
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And the previous proponent kept saying, you can't have a vision.

920
01:28:41,643 --> 01:28:42,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's where it stops.

921
01:28:43,045 --> 01:28:45,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how you get community to invest.

922
01:28:45,827 --> 01:28:52,830
[SPEAKER_03]: into themselves and you get them to believe what can happen, show them what can happen by the community engagement, right?

923
01:28:52,970 --> 01:29:02,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And getting the community to tell you what they want in certain areas and having municipal leaders and other stakeholders and stuff coming together and making that happen.

924
01:29:02,275 --> 01:29:06,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just, again, clear vision, engaging the community.

925
01:29:07,477 --> 01:29:18,502
[SPEAKER_03]: and have a pro, you definitely have to have a pro investment attitude, but not to the point where it's status quo, and everything should be handed to you the way, just because you say, you know.

926
01:29:19,762 --> 01:29:28,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, but Danielle, to your point, I've never dreamed of going to China and building, I can tell you that in planning school.

927
01:29:29,367 --> 01:29:36,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you have to see the forest before you, but I think your vision

928
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:41,949
[SPEAKER_11]: about how the future will be is so critical.

929
01:29:42,309 --> 01:29:46,732
[SPEAKER_11]: I worked for years and years, decades in Cambridge.

930
01:29:47,353 --> 01:29:50,995
[SPEAKER_11]: And I worked in Cambridge Port, and I worked all over Cambridge.

931
01:29:51,856 --> 01:29:57,120
[SPEAKER_11]: And it took a long time, a lot of patience, and a lot of perseverance.

932
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:05,946
[SPEAKER_11]: And I saw some pretty rough areas sensibly expanded

933
01:30:06,419 --> 01:30:08,000
[SPEAKER_11]: to support the community.

934
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:34,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really hope that we have enough support for the long vision, because I hear people who live off of Mystic Avenue, on the side streets going up the hills, and their family communities, their, you know, one, two, three family houses, and they

935
01:30:36,668 --> 01:30:42,090
[SPEAKER_11]: very much would like to see Mystic Avenue become part of their community.

936
01:30:42,491 --> 01:30:49,333
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where this concept of highways being a problem that you can't build, has anybody ever heard of New York City?

937
01:30:49,574 --> 01:31:04,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you have to, people got to live and you need to, you need to listen to people who have urban planning experience and to communicate

938
01:31:04,908 --> 01:31:09,329
[SPEAKER_11]: and listen to the community because the community really wants it.

939
01:31:11,929 --> 01:31:16,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do understand this gentleman, he wants to invest, he wants to build.

940
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:21,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Prestige Car Wash is a humongous, humongous company.

941
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:33,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I go there and it's a nightmare getting in and out of that car wash between BJ's across the way and bicycles.

942
01:31:35,749 --> 01:31:42,893
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no good way with that little frontage to do it, never mind off Mystic Avenue.

943
01:31:42,973 --> 01:31:48,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Just, anyway, just my thoughts.

944
01:31:54,058 --> 01:31:55,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you all.

945
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:59,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if there's any other items.

946
01:31:59,081 --> 01:32:00,562
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no other items on the agenda.

947
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:08,167
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's nothing else that need to be added by the city staff or other board members, I can ask for a motion to adjourn.

948
01:32:12,023 --> 01:32:21,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I just add, if any of the members would like copies of the books to just shoot, it's probably easy to apply to Danielle.

949
01:32:21,813 --> 01:32:24,857
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll just tell you, we have in paper copies.

950
01:32:25,077 --> 01:32:28,941
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking at them to remind myself the comprehensive plan, the climate plan.

951
01:32:29,402 --> 01:32:31,344
[SPEAKER_13]: We now have the housing production plan.

952
01:32:33,332 --> 01:32:35,573
[SPEAKER_11]: We signed it out on a lend-lease.

953
01:32:35,953 --> 01:32:38,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I was literally going to say the same thing.

954
01:32:38,914 --> 01:32:41,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, because those things are bloody expensive.

955
01:32:42,035 --> 01:32:44,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Read it and return it.

956
01:32:44,995 --> 01:32:47,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a library, sign it out.

957
01:32:47,076 --> 01:32:49,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll come down to City Hall, sign it out and bring it back.

958
01:32:52,845 --> 01:32:54,286
[SPEAKER_13]: I trust you all with them.

959
01:32:55,307 --> 01:33:02,813
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say for any member of the public, if anybody ever asks, there are copies of all of them in the historic room at the library.

960
01:33:03,234 --> 01:33:12,982
[SPEAKER_13]: So any member of the public can go to the historic room and read through not just our current ones, but an crazy, amazing array of old documents as well.

961
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:20,762
[SPEAKER_13]: So just as FYI, but yeah, maybe, or if you want to collaborate, we do have enough in our office right now that we could lend you all one.

962
01:33:21,183 --> 01:33:24,184
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you feel that you want to keep it and mark it up, you can.

963
01:33:24,644 --> 01:33:28,305
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you say, I wanted to look at it, but I want to give it back, you can do that as well.

964
01:33:31,546 --> 01:33:34,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, feel free to stop by City Hall or I'll drop it off at your house.

965
01:33:34,988 --> 01:33:38,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I like going for a walk, so let me know.

966
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:40,229
[SPEAKER_11]: City Hall's not that far away.

967
01:33:40,249 --> 01:33:41,530
[SPEAKER_11]: We can drive to you.

968
01:33:42,567 --> 01:33:56,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just let you know, I dropped in the draft or proposed 2025 city board meeting schedule in the folder so that you guys can plan in advance.

969
01:33:59,538 --> 01:34:04,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just going to have Alicia look at that and just make sure there's no conflict.

970
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:13,002
[SPEAKER_13]: The city council would like us to actually set our meeting schedule because they want to set a schedule for the city council subcommittee meetings.

971
01:34:13,162 --> 01:34:21,685
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are trying to work pretty hard to not conflict with each other so that at least Danielle and I can attend both.

972
01:34:23,745 --> 01:34:28,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just to add to that, I believe, so we had moved one meeting

973
01:34:29,055 --> 01:34:30,856
[SPEAKER_06]: The last week's meeting got moved to today.

974
01:34:31,157 --> 01:34:32,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have another meeting next week.

975
01:34:33,178 --> 01:34:34,299
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two back to back.

976
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:42,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're, yeah, so there's no other changes.

977
01:34:42,085 --> 01:34:44,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So everything in your calendar should be fine.

978
01:34:45,788 --> 01:34:50,272
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be November 6th, November 20th.

979
01:34:53,547 --> 01:35:05,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the time to speak on the 2025 calendar for maybe revisiting elections only because after January 23rd, I will be stepping down.

980
01:35:05,994 --> 01:35:14,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to, I'm not seeking, I'm not able to continue on the board, unfortunately.

981
01:35:15,219 --> 01:35:16,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll need a new chair.

982
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:24,112
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's for people to think about when you're planning the meetings.

983
01:35:25,073 --> 01:35:26,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we'll miss you, Jackie.

984
01:35:26,214 --> 01:35:28,855
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you're off to new and exciting things.

985
01:35:29,136 --> 01:35:33,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I want to give, anything that I do, I want to give quality time to.

986
01:35:33,598 --> 01:35:43,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that I've realized is that in order for me to continue just to stay sane, it's time for me to step down, at least as chair.

987
01:35:43,765 --> 01:35:47,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I may be able to stay on the board for a while, but

988
01:35:48,793 --> 01:35:51,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to be cheer.

989
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:52,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost positive I cannot.

990
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:56,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult for me.

991
01:35:57,157 --> 01:36:06,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Only because you want to just make sure everything is, I want to give quality time to everything and I'm struggling with that as of late.

992
01:36:07,322 --> 01:36:10,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've put a lot of thought into it to actually say this now.

993
01:36:11,577 --> 01:36:21,821
[SPEAKER_03]: with my community here, taping it, because I was thinking about it, like, no, no, no, I'll just, I'll just, maybe I can continue to work with the city, but it's, it's, it's extremely difficult.

994
01:36:24,163 --> 01:36:25,903
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to take care of yourself first, Jackie.

995
01:36:25,963 --> 01:36:26,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

996
01:36:26,464 --> 01:36:28,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate everything you've done and continue to do.

997
01:36:30,125 --> 01:36:31,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I appreciate, thank you so much.

998
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:45,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And in saying that, Emily will be chairing the meeting next week, and I hope to join at some point, but Emily has agreed to chair the meeting, because I will be traveling.

999
01:36:47,603 --> 01:36:54,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so Alicia and Danielle, I can chat with you guys, you two, in advance of the meeting, make sure I don't mess anything up.

1000
01:36:55,904 --> 01:36:56,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shoes to fill.

1001
01:36:59,345 --> 01:37:03,086
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are all awesome, so you'll be great.

1002
01:37:07,498 --> 01:37:10,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so a motion to adjourn.

1003
01:37:15,461 --> 01:37:16,002
[SPEAKER_08]: So moved.

1004
01:37:17,522 --> 01:37:18,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll toss in a second.

1005
01:37:20,364 --> 01:37:21,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

1006
01:37:22,404 --> 01:37:22,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1007
01:37:24,065 --> 01:37:24,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy Strang?

1008
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:25,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1009
01:37:26,326 --> 01:37:27,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Ari Fishman?

1010
01:37:27,747 --> 01:37:27,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1011
01:37:28,487 --> 01:37:29,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben LaValle?

1012
01:37:31,028 --> 01:37:31,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1013
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:32,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Cowles?

1014
01:37:33,709 --> 01:37:33,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1015
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:35,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam Behrens?

1016
01:37:37,715 --> 01:37:38,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

1017
01:37:38,716 --> 01:37:40,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1018
01:37:40,098 --> 01:37:40,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an addict.

1019
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:42,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great evening.
