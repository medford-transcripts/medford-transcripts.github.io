00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:35,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings.

2
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:43,328
[SPEAKER_00]: I am John Petrala, and we're doing a show for and about the city of Medford.

3
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:55,932
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:57,513 --> 00:01:02,495
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, before we start the show, we just want to discuss Veterans Day.

5
00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:13,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say, in memory of many, in honor of all, thank you.

6
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bravery and service will never be forgotten.

7
00:01:17,722 --> 00:01:19,063
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank all veterans.

8
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:29,122
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I think we'll move on to some election results from this past election, the local elections in Medford.

9
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:37,189
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're just going to discuss the local elections.

10
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,211
[SPEAKER_00]: We had questions six, seven, and eight.

11
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:50,320
[SPEAKER_00]: And on question six, which was the fire station, building a new fire station, I think everyone knows that it did not pass.

12
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:54,360
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, it's not gonna happen.

13
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,582
[SPEAKER_00]: City of Method, citizens voted it down.

14
00:01:58,403 --> 00:02:04,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Question seven, which was one of the override questions, that passed.

15
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:08,350
[SPEAKER_00]: The yeses were 14,847, and the noes were 13,304, as you can see on the chart.

16
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,572
[SPEAKER_00]: That was question seven, very close election.

17
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:26,790
[SPEAKER_00]: And on question eight, which was another override question, you'll also see the yeses won.

18
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,230
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 14,660.

19
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,471
[SPEAKER_00]: And the noes were 13,518.

20
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:31,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So both questions were extremely close.

21
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,916
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get into too much about it.

22
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I'd like to say about it is I don't think the city won either way.

23
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:59,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this question has divided the city.

24
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,740
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kept us divided.

25
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,962
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people.

26
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:13,109
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there was a lot of celebration about, you know, people winning and they're going to get their override and, you know, the schools and everything else.

27
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,494
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of people that this is going to affect financially.

28
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,895
[SPEAKER_00]: People are struggling as it is.

29
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:28,199
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal opinion is this was not the time for the override.

30
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:40,917
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it was voted on, a lot of people celebrated, and I just don't really think that anyone wins when you divide the city.

31
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:50,942
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just think a lot of people are going to really struggle with these new tax increases coming.

32
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:53,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my opinion.

33
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,764
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I want to say about it.

34
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:58,326
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to touch on it briefly.

35
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:00,907
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fire stations are no.

36
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:03,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Both overrides passed.

37
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:12,253
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really just hoping, you know, for the people that voted yes, I truly, truly hope

38
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:20,813
[SPEAKER_00]: that the new funds that come into the city, I hope that it goes to the schools.

39
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:23,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that it goes to the roads.

40
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:27,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I just want to see the right thing, uh, done with the money.

41
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,741
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that's it.

42
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:33,164
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we want to talk about as far as the elections go.

43
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:35,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's part of method.

44
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:39,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was something important and, uh, we'll end the discussion right there.

45
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,171
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um,

46
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:43,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to move on.

47
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:49,923
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next discussion, time to get on with your show.

48
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:58,531
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we'd like to congratulate all the GBL All-Stars and MVPs from Medford High School.

49
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:01,894
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go through the list of names.

50
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:06,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if I don't get your name quite right.

51
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:07,700
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best here.

52
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,851
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Justin Marino, football MVP.

53

[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations to all of you.

69
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:50,690
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd also like to take a minute to congratulate Joe Sacco, better known as JoJo in Metfed, on his being named interim head coach of the Boston Bruins.

70
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:57,588
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone can get the Bruins out of their current slump, Joe Sacco is the guy for the job.

71
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:02,292
[SPEAKER_00]: So best wishes to Joe Joe Sacco and our Boston Bruins.

72
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:13,921
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to remind everyone that there's a show on the sideline, Method High School Sports with James Klugisch, and that's on YouTube.

73
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:18,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good show, and I highly recommend that you watch it.

74
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:24,939
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Method Happenings wants to talk about a lot of great things that are happening in the city of Method.

75
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:30,962
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point of the show, so we're going to do some discussions on Method Happenings.

76
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:42,469
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is the Friends of the Method Public Library is holding their holiday book scale on December 7th from 9 to 3 at the Method Public Library.

77
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:48,446
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the annual small sale of all holiday themed and giftable items.

78
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:59,125
[SPEAKER_00]: All children's books will be available along with puzzles, games, miscellaneous items, and special items like hardcover fiction.

79
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:03,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the library also has an eBay store.

80
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:11,154
[SPEAKER_00]: It is used to sell items that generally do not sell well at their regular sales, but they're still great items.

81
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:15,077
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes DVD sets, antique books,

82
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:17,410
[SPEAKER_00]: and higher priced items.

83
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,275
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be nice to check that out as well.

84
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:21,717
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great deals.

85
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,125
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing happening in Metfid that we'd like to discuss.

86
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:35,456
[SPEAKER_00]: is the local arts collaborative, collaborative, sorry, located at 162 Mystic Avenue, Method.

87
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:48,704
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be having a holiday shopping event featuring unique gift ideas for family, friends, and this is taking place on Saturday, December 7th from 11 to four.

88
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:52,666
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something else, a nice thing to take the family to.

89
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:55,808
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these events we're gonna be talking about

90
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:58,930
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for kids, great for adults.

91
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,651
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something to do.

92
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:04,313
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just a lot of activity going on in Method.

93
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:05,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Good activity.

94
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:13,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, something that we think is worth it to check out is the books and brews.

95
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:17,400
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the holiday edition at the Method Brewing Company.

96
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,342
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be on Sunday, December 8 at 2 PM.

97
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:28,356
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a books and brew pairing with bookends from Winchester, Mass.

98
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:36,380
[SPEAKER_00]: The tickets for this event or the info is at www.eventbrite.com.

99
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,241
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a nice time.

100
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:50,939
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing to keep in mind is the annual Meffitt Police November food drive for non-perishable items is taking place until November 20th.

101
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,484
[SPEAKER_00]: The donation boxes are available at the Meffitt Police Station and our Senior Center.

102
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:05,709
[SPEAKER_00]: All proceeds go to the Meffitt Senior Center and are handed out Wednesday, November 20th from 11.30 to 1 p.m.

103
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:10,233
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I say?

104
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:11,673
[SPEAKER_00]: What can anyone say?

105
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,154
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great cause.

106
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:17,177
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you can help out, please do so.

107
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:26,922
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Medford Food Drive, and you can drop stuff at the Senior Center and the Medford Police Station.

108
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:29,864
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's non-perishable items.

109
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:33,126
[SPEAKER_00]: And we appreciate any help you can give them.

110
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:42,597
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing going on at the senior center is what I did was pick up a copy of our place, our time.

111
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:47,100
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a publication that's put out by the method council on aging.

112
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Very informative.

113
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:57,103
[SPEAKER_00]: The Method Senior Center, as I think most people are aware, some aren't, is located at 101 Riverside Ave.

114
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:06,765
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a calendar of events that they publish every month, and you can find that in the Our Place, Our Time publication.

115
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:08,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Worth getting.

116
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:13,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So the annual Thanksgiving dinner is on Thursday, November 21st, from 12 noon to 3 p.m.

117
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:23,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a Letty Paterno holiday party.

118
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:28,797
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take place Friday, December 6th from 12 noon to 3 p.m.

119
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:33,441
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can enjoy a full-course catered meal by Henry's Catering.

120
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:38,526
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have entertainment provided by the Boston Saxophone Quartet.

121
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:41,008
[SPEAKER_00]: And also coming up,

122
00:11:42,036 --> 00:12:00,247
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Senior Center is there's plenty of day trips and getaways, Encore Casinos, one, going to Walmart, the Outback, Townline Bowling and Lunch, some great ones like the North Shore Music Theater or Christmas Carol, the Holiday Pops at the Symphony Hall.

123
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:05,270
[SPEAKER_00]: And for details on trips and getaways, you can contact the Meffitt Senior Center.

124

[SPEAKER_00]: Phone number is 781-396-6010 and you can also visit their website www.methodmask.org slash departments.

125
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a lot of activity for seniors.

126
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:28,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Worthwhile to get the publication.

127
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:30,335
[SPEAKER_00]: The publication is available at plenty of

128
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:38,000
[SPEAKER_00]: stores and outlets all throughout the city, local stores, so worth taking a look at.

129
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:47,507
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we really have to mention is because it brings a lot of activity to Meffitt Square.

130
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:53,636
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the upcoming acts for the Chevalier Theater in Meffitt Square.

131
00:12:55,237 --> 00:12:58,818
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna go through a few of the upcoming shows.

132
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do bring a lot of activity.

133
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Lions Up the Square, and they do a nice job with these shows.

00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:11,844
[SPEAKER_00]: So on November 22nd, a drag queen Christmas.

139
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll be checking that one out.

00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:44,898
[SPEAKER_00]: December 12th, Engelbert Humperdinck.
