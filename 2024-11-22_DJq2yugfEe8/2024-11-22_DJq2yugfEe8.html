    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=31.165s">Hello,</a>  everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=36.466s">I</a>  am John Petrala, and we're doing a show for and about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=47.71s">The</a>  purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=57.513s">First</a>  of all, before we start the show, we just want to discuss Veterans Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=67.578s">And</a>  I just want to say, in memory of many, in honor of all, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=73.54s">Your</a>  bravery and service will never be forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=77.722s">We</a>  thank all veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=81.516s">And</a>  now I think we'll move on to some election results from this past election, the local elections in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=90.483s">And</a>  I think we're just going to discuss the local elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=97.229s">We</a>  had questions six, seven, and eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=101.612s">And</a>  on question six, which was the fire station, building a new fire station, I think everyone knows that it did not pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=111.618s">That</a>  was, it's not gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=115.181s">City</a>  of Method, citizens voted it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=118.403s">Question</a>  seven, which was one of the override questions, that passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=126.029s">The</a>  yeses were 14,847, and the noes were 13,304, as you can see on the chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=128.37s">That</a>  was question seven, very close election. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=139.063s">And</a>  on question eight, which was another override question, you'll also see the yeses won. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=147.01s">It</a>  was 14,660. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=147.27s">And</a>  the noes were 13,518. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=149.032s">So</a>  both questions were extremely close. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=151.634s">I</a>  don't want to get into too much about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=168.769s">I</a>  guess what I'd like to say about it is I don't think the city won either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=175.235s">I</a>  think this question has divided the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=179.379s">It's</a>  kept us divided. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=180.76s">There's</a>  a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=183.963s">I</a>  know there was a lot of celebration about, you know, people winning and they're going to get their override and, you know, the schools and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=194.33s">But</a>  there's also a lot of people that this is going to affect financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=200.234s">People</a>  are struggling as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=203.516s">My</a>  personal opinion is this was not the time for the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=209.686s">However,</a>  it was voted on, a lot of people celebrated, and I just don't really think that anyone wins when you divide the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=223.718s">You</a>  know, I just think a lot of people are going to really struggle with these new tax increases coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=231.722s">So</a>  that's my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=233.943s">That's</a>  all I want to say about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=235.824s">I</a>  just wanted to touch on it briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=239.046s">So</a>  the fire stations are no. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=241.647s">Both</a>  overrides passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=244.409s">And</a>  I'm really just hoping, you know, for the people that voted yes, I truly, truly hope <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=253.807s">that</a>  the new funds that come into the city, I hope that it goes to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=261.374s">I</a>  hope that it goes to the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=263.315s">Uh,</a>  I just want to see the right thing, uh, done with the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=268.4s">And,</a>  um, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=269.861s">That's</a>  all we want to talk about as far as the elections go. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=273.184s">Um,</a>  it's part of method. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=275.506s">I</a>  think it was something important and, uh, we'll end the discussion right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=280.75s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=282.396s">I</a>  think we're going to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=283.657s">And</a>  the next discussion, time to get on with your show. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=291.204s">First</a>  of all, we'd like to congratulate all the GBL All-Stars and MVPs from Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=299.572s">So</a>  let's go through the list of names. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=302.715s">I</a>  apologize if I don't get your name quite right. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=306.318s">I'm</a>  going to do my best here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=309.15s">So</a>  we have Justin Marino, football MVP. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=314.012s">We</a>  have some football all-stars. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=316.053s">We're</a>  going to start with Nathan Brough, Prince Xavier, Darius Weeks, Demi George, Samuel Diarestl, Guy Martins. <a

href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=399.062s">We'd</a>  also like to take a minute to congratulate Joe Sacco, better known as JoJo in Metfed, on his being named interim head coach of the Boston Bruins. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=411.743s">If</a>  anyone can get the Bruins out of their current slump, Joe Sacco is the guy for the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=418.048s">So</a>  best wishes to Joe Joe Sacco and our Boston Bruins. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=423.733s">I</a>  also want to remind everyone that there's a show on the sideline, Method High School Sports with James Klugisch, and that's on YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=434.182s">And</a>  it's a good show, and I highly recommend that you watch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=438.935s">And</a>  now Method Happenings wants to talk about a lot of great things that are happening in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=444.979s">That's</a>  the point of the show, so we're going to do some discussions on Method Happenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=451.262s">The</a>  first thing is the Friends of the Method Public Library is holding their holiday book scale on December 7th from 9 to 3 at the Method Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=463.491s">This</a>  is the annual small sale of all holiday themed and giftable items. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=469.518s">All</a>  children's books will be available along with puzzles, games, miscellaneous items, and special items like hardcover fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=479.706s">Remember,</a>  the library also has an eBay store. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=483.649s">It</a>  is used to sell items that generally do not sell well at their regular sales, but they're still great items. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=491.715s">It</a>  includes DVD sets, antique books, <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=496.067s">and</a>  higher priced items. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=498.011s">So</a>  it'd be nice to check that out as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=500.295s">A</a>  lot of great deals. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=503.3s">The</a>  next thing happening in Metfid that we'd like to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=507.512s">is</a>  the local arts collaborative, collaborative, sorry, located at 162 Mystic Avenue, Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=515.817s">We'll</a>  be having a holiday shopping event featuring unique gift ideas for family, friends, and this is taking place on Saturday, December 7th from 11 to four. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=529.284s">So</a>  that's something else, a nice thing to take the family to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=532.686s">A</a>  lot of these events we're gonna be talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=536.408s">It's</a>  great for kids, great for adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=539.65s">And</a>  it's something to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=540.911s">And</a>  there's just a lot of activity going on in Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=544.393s">Good</a>  activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=547.915s">Also,</a>  something that we think is worth it to check out is the books and brews. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=553.778s">This</a>  is the holiday edition at the Method Brewing Company. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=557.941s">That's</a>  going to be on Sunday, December 8 at 2 PM. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=562.754s">This</a>  is a books and brew pairing with bookends from Winchester, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=569.117s">The</a>  tickets for this event or the info is at www.eventbrite.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=577.02s">That</a>  should be a nice time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=579.832s">And</a>  the other thing to keep in mind is the annual Medford Police November food drive for non-perishable items is taking place until November 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=591.7s">The</a>  donation boxes are available at the Medford Police Station and our Senior Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=598.985s">All</a>  proceeds go to the Medford Senior Center and are handed out Wednesday, November 20th from 11.30 to 1 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=609.332s">What</a>  can I say? <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=610.713s">What</a>  can anyone say? <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=611.833s">It's</a>  a great cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=613.755s">So,</a>  you know, if you can help out, please do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=617.697s">That</a>  is the Medford Food Drive, and you can drop stuff at the Senior Center and the Medford Police Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=627.523s">And</a>  it's non-perishable items. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=630.904s">And</a>  we appreciate any help you can give them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=635.133s">The</a>  other thing going on at the senior center is what I did was pick up a copy of our place, our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=643.277s">It's</a>  a publication that's put out by the method council on aging. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=647.58s">Very</a>  informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=650.281s">The</a>  Method Senior Center, as I think most people are aware, some aren't, is located at 101 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=657.663s">They</a>  also have a calendar of events that they publish every month, and you can find that in the Our Place, Our Time publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=667.685s">Worth</a>  getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=669.606s">So</a>  the annual Thanksgiving dinner is on Thursday, November 21st, from 12 noon to 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=680.149s">And</a>  then there's a Letty Paterno holiday party. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=683.372s">It's</a>  going to take place Friday, December 6th from 12 noon to 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=689.598s">And</a>  you can enjoy a full-course catered meal by Henry's Catering. <a

up, <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=702.036s">at</a>  the Senior Center is there's plenty of day trips and getaways, Encore Casinos, one, going to Walmart, the Outback, Townline Bowling and Lunch, some great ones like the North Shore Music Theater or Christmas Carol, the Holiday Pops at the Symphony Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=720.827s">And</a>  for details on trips and getaways, you can contact the Medford Senior Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=726.53s">Phone</a>  number is 781-396-6010 and you can also visit their website www.methodmask.org slash departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=740.673s">Just</a>  a lot of activity for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=745.194s">Worthwhile</a>  to get the publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=748.254s">The</a>  publication is available at plenty of <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=751.395s">stores</a>  and outlets all throughout the city, local stores, so worth taking a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=759.041s">The</a>  other thing we really have to mention is because it brings a lot of activity to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=768.514s">And</a>  that's the upcoming acts for the Chevalier Theater in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=775.237s">I'm</a>  just gonna go through a few of the upcoming shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=780.559s">And</a>  they do bring a lot of activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=783.4s">Lions</a>  Up the

I'm going to mention is Becker Whaling over at Four Good Vibes Gift Shop and Boutique. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=922.897s">They</a>  have locations in Burlington, Medford, and Kingston. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=927.379s">They</a>  run virtual craft fairs that specialize in unique handmade gifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=933.382s">So</a>  if you like handmade gifts, Four Good Vibes is for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=938.222s">They</a>  have a couple of local craft fairs coming up that I wanted to mention. <a

business, I've got to mention Method Soap Company. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=993.079s">It's</a>  a new company. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=994.219s">They</a>  were established in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=995.82s">And</a>  it's a local success story. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=999.181s">What</a>  can you say? <a

soap. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=1030.204s">They</a>  do great gift baskets, and they do great gift sets that you can get for the holidays as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=1036.367s">And</a>  I'm going to mention it's a lot more than a soap company. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=1039.708s">I</a>  think they have, I don't know, somewhere over 80 products available right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DJq2yugfEe8&t=1047.464s">event</a>  that I want to mention is happening on Saturday, November 23rd from 10 a.m. <a
