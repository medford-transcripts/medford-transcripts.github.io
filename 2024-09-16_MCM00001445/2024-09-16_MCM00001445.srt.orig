29
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna read all 44 now.

30
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:52,926

31
00:03:53,426 --> 00:04:01,812
[SPEAKER_11]: They also have utility poll numbers associated with them, but since most people don't know the utility poll numbers, I'm just going to read the closest address in the application number.

32
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:07,376
[SPEAKER_11]: They all have application numbers that we've been using for tracking and I'm sure Verizon is as well.

00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:28,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Second, I'll call on the voices in opposition to the applications.

00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone who speaks will receive two minutes of time.

93
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Questions to Verizon should be directed to me, the chair.

94
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:50,120
[SPEAKER_11]: After the public comment period, we will focus on applications based off of the three general geographic areas I mentioned, South Medford, Hillside slash Upper Mystic Ave, and the Medford Square Glenwood area.

95
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:54,723
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee will discuss locations at each geographic area.

96
00:08:56,304 --> 00:09:00,147

97
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:01,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, two minutes per speaker.

98
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,411
[SPEAKER_11]: There may be more discussion by the committee before moving on to a motion.

99
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:13,770
[SPEAKER_11]: The chair will then open the floor for a motion by a committee member to vote on the applications one at a time in this group.

100
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:21,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Presuming the motion carries, the chair will indicate that the members may grant grant with conditions or deny each application.

101
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,194
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the vote will be taken via roll call.

102
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:29,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Rules of the hearing.

103
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:36,058
[SPEAKER_11]: If you wish to speak, please use the raise hand function and we will

104
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:39,408
[SPEAKER_11]: put a queue together and calling you in order.

105
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:41,869
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do the best that we can between Amanda and Dave.

106
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we'll do the best we can there.

107
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:50,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, Zoom makes it a little bit tricky, but we'll figure it out.

108
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,795
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to make sure that folks have an opportunity to speak.

109
00:09:54,735 --> 00:10:01,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, please direct comments and questions to the chair, to me, and we can get the questions to Verizon.

110
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,759
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll hear them.

111
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:07,335
[SPEAKER_11]: No profanity, no name calling, no other rude or disruptive behavior.

112
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:12,899
[SPEAKER_11]: I reserve the right as the chair to mute participants who disrupt the proceedings.

113
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:18,904
[SPEAKER_11]: And each speaker will receive two minutes as I've stated a couple of times.

114
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:27,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Written comments may still be submitted via email, 5gcomments at medford-ma.gov.

115
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:28,532
[SPEAKER_11]: We will check that email address.

116
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:35,635
[SPEAKER_11]: before voting, see if there's any comments still that need to be put into the record.

117
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:49,161
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the chat disabled due to the expectation of a largely attended hearing, and we'd like to funnel written comments to the email address.

118
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:56,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, were you able to find the map

119
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:58,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, all right.

120
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:02,836
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I'd like to do is just briefly introduce that map if you wanna share your screen.

121
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:07,379
[SPEAKER_11]: To assist in this discussion, we've mapped the proposed locations.

122
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:11,062
[SPEAKER_11]: That map has been available to folks via the website.

123
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:14,145
[SPEAKER_11]: If you just wanna share it for a moment.

124
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:18,308
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll come back to this.

125
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,501
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the map, just a Google map street view.

126
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:29,943
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we'll be able to do is zoom in on each location as they come up as needed while we discuss.

127
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:31,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Amanda.

128
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:35,065
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go back to regular view.

129
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:49,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'd like to... All right, well, before we get into the comments and the map and things like that, Verizon has prepared a presentation

130
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:57,898
[SPEAKER_11]: After the presentation, the committee may ask questions before going into the public comment period.

131
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:06,163
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that said, is there someone from Verizon who would like to introduce your team and get going on the presentation?

132
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:10,886
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, Mr. Chairman, this is Michael Gymo representing Verizon.

133

00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:35,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Slide.

139
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:37,374

142
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:54,461
[SPEAKER_27]: And you can reach that if there's any information after tonight that you're looking for.

143
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:55,222
[SPEAKER_27]: Slide.

144
00:12:56,323 --> 00:12:58,324
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm Michael Gyma.

145
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:02,508
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm the legal counsel for Verizon from the law firm Robinson and Cole.

146
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:06,031
[SPEAKER_27]: Stan Yusevich from Verizon Government Affairs is here.

147
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:07,172
[SPEAKER_27]: He'll speak to you as well.

148
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:10,515
[SPEAKER_27]: Jason Flanagan is a radio frequency engineer.

149
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:13,337
[SPEAKER_27]: He helps to design the network from a technical standpoint.

150
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,461
[SPEAKER_27]: He'll make a few remarks.

151
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,842
[SPEAKER_27]: Sean Conway is a Verizon engineer.

152
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:23,544
[SPEAKER_27]: He will describe the small cell equipment and the process of determining pole locations.

153
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:31,627
[SPEAKER_27]: And Dr. Eric Swanson is a professor of physics at the University of Pittsburgh, and he will cover the safety of small cells.

154
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:32,948
[SPEAKER_27]: Slide, please.

155
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:38,056
[SPEAKER_27]: Just a real brief overview on the legal context for these applications.

156
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:42,056
[SPEAKER_27]: Medford has a small cell policy as the chair just discussed.

157
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:47,057
[SPEAKER_27]: That small cell policy governs to the extent that it's not inconsistent with federal law.

158
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:55,479
[SPEAKER_27]: Federal law has a number of aspects of regulation of small cell projects.

159
00:13:55,859 --> 00:14:01,920
[SPEAKER_27]: Federal law imposes a 60 day time limit on a municipality to approve or deny small cell applications.

160
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,062
[SPEAKER_27]: It controls the extent to which a city or state can regulate the design of small cells.

161
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:15,647
[SPEAKER_27]: It prohibits municipalities from placing a moratorium on small cell deployment or from prohibiting service from being provided in a particular area.

162
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:22,610
[SPEAKER_27]: And it also says that municipalities may not evaluate small cell applications based on health concerns.

163
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:23,971
[SPEAKER_27]: Slide.

164
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:34,694
[SPEAKER_27]: Kathleen, so the background on these particular applications is Verizon filed applications in the fall of 2019 that comply with the federal law as well as the local policy.

165
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:40,118
[SPEAKER_27]: There were public hearings scheduled in November and December 2019 but those were not held.

166
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,142
[SPEAKER_27]: Verizon held an information fair for the community to

167
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:47,094
[SPEAKER_27]: provide some more information about these projects.

168
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:51,858
[SPEAKER_27]: In January of 2020, about 150 residents attended.

169
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,682
[SPEAKER_27]: The city set a small cell committee hearing for March 18th, 2020.

170
00:14:56,963 --> 00:15:03,148
[SPEAKER_27]: Unfortunately, that timing didn't work because it was canceled when the COVID shutdowns took effect.

171
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:11,876
[SPEAKER_27]: Verizon has extended by agreement the 60 day federal shot clock four times during those periods of time, but that shot clock ran out

172
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:19,547
[SPEAKER_27]: on May 15th, 2020, and has not been extended, but Verizon has continued to work with the city process as a show of good faith.

173
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:25,392
[SPEAKER_27]: And we're here tonight at the hearing to have the 44 applications heard.

174
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:34,220
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm gonna turn this over to Stan Yusevich next, and he's gonna give some additional information to you, slide.

175
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:38,404
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, Michael, and thank you members of the committee.

176
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:40,475
[SPEAKER_33]: the members of the public.

177
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:57,588
[SPEAKER_33]: Verizon is prepared to make a significant investment in Medford's technology infrastructure, as we have in other neighboring communities, such as Somerville, Cambridge, Revere, Malden, and Boston.

178
00:15:58,149 --> 00:15:58,449
[SPEAKER_33]: Slide.

179
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:05,349
[SPEAKER_33]: We have all witnessed the rapid growth in the demand for wireless service.

180
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:12,232
[SPEAKER_33]: This demand for wireless technology has increased dramatically since the COVID-19 outbreak.

181
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:18,134
[SPEAKER_33]: More people are working from their homes and their children are being educated remotely.

182
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:25,877
[SPEAKER_33]: As we see from tonight's hearing, technology is making it possible for the important work of local government to continue.

183
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,583
[SPEAKER_33]: In recent years, let's slide, thank you.

184
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:39,005
[SPEAKER_33]: In recent years, Verizon started bringing the next generation of wireless technology to the region's larger cities like Boston.

185
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:42,426
[SPEAKER_33]: Now we are expanding to new cities and towns.

186
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:46,647
[SPEAKER_33]: We've chosen Medford to provide better wireless coverage.

187
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:52,028
[SPEAKER_33]: This effort is to better serve your residents, school children, and businesses.

188
00:16:52,908 --> 00:17:00,291
[SPEAKER_33]: The applications we've submitted are a starting point to provide these benefits to the neighborhoods of Medford.

189
00:17:01,472 --> 00:17:06,554
[SPEAKER_33]: Our plan, however, will improve wireless service for the entire city.

190
00:17:07,274 --> 00:17:07,654
[SPEAKER_33]: Slide.

191
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:12,936
[SPEAKER_33]: The promise and benefits of the future of 5G is bright.

192
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,938
[SPEAKER_33]: Collectively, we can imagine and create opportunities for greater energy,

193
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:32,263
[SPEAKER_33]: efficiencies in our buildings, traffic signaling coordination, communication reliabilities for our first responders, and increased access to remote learning.

194
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:33,824
[SPEAKER_33]: Slide.

195
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:44,594
[SPEAKER_33]: The 5G economy will have a significant impact on American cities and towns, large and small, over the next 10 years.

196
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:57,435
[SPEAKER_33]: we will see benefits across the country, including over $43 billion in economic growth and the creation of over 100,000 new jobs in Massachusetts alone.

197
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:00,797
[SPEAKER_33]: These are the reasons that we are here.

198
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:04,899
[SPEAKER_33]: These are the reasons why you have these applications before you.

199
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,182
[SPEAKER_33]: I respectfully ask for the support and the approval of these applications.

200
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:15,105
[SPEAKER_33]: And I want to thank you for your time, and I appreciate your service to the community.

201
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:19,774
[SPEAKER_33]: Next I'll turn it over to Jason Flanagan from Verizon Engineering.

202
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:27,238
[SPEAKER_29]: Hello, my name is Jason Flanagan and I'm the radio frequency engineer for these locations that we are proposing today.

203
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:33,902
[SPEAKER_29]: This slide that we're looking at is an example of what the sites we are proposing will cover.

204
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:42,187
[SPEAKER_29]: They're contained mostly to line of sight coverage, which means if you can't see the antenna, you most likely won't be able to be covered by the antenna.

205
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:54,647
[SPEAKER_29]: Since the frequencies licensed to us by the FCC are much higher than the frequencies used for our older technologies, coverage is much smaller than what you would previously expect for a cell site.

206
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:03,014
[SPEAKER_29]: You can think of it in relation to a vehicle driving by your house, playing loud music.

207
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:07,517
[SPEAKER_29]: The first thing you'll hear is the low frequencies, which are the taller, bigger buildings.

208
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:15,026
[SPEAKER_29]: They travel further than the higher frequencies, which is what all these sites we are proposing today are using.

209
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:19,428
[SPEAKER_29]: Next up to discuss siting concerns is Sean Conway.

210
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:24,010
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Jason, and thank you everyone for attending tonight.

211
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,530
[SPEAKER_38]: My name is Sean Conway.

212
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,332
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm an engineer with Horizon Wireless in the real estate department, and I work on small cells.

213
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:32,485
[SPEAKER_38]: What exactly is a small cell?

214
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:45,531
[SPEAKER_38]: As Jason said, they're small antennas that we bring in and place on street furniture, utility poles or light poles to fill in areas of our network where we have capacity issues or coverage issues.

215
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:48,492
[SPEAKER_38]: So we don't have to put in a giant macro site.

216
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:51,673
[SPEAKER_38]: We're able to fill these areas in with these small cells.

217
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:56,416
[SPEAKER_38]: On the slide here, we're going to show you what exactly a small cell looks like.

218
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,377
[SPEAKER_38]: At the top of the pole,

219
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:04,939
[SPEAKER_38]: We have a set of antennas that will emit the radio frequency out to get the signal.

220
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:10,921
[SPEAKER_38]: Just below that, we have a fiber connection that will connect the site back to our network.

221
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:22,524
[SPEAKER_38]: Below that, we have a power disconnect that if any utility workers or workers need to get onto the pole, they're able to go into that and disconnect the site to turn it off so they can work at the location.

222
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:24,425
[SPEAKER_38]: And below that's our power meter.

223
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:34,447
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll also mention that within this installation, there are no fans or cooling agents that are on the installation.

224
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:44,209
[SPEAKER_38]: So once Jason is able to select an area we would like to put a small cell, the real estate team goes out and tries to find a good pole to attach to.

225
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:46,950
[SPEAKER_38]: That's not the easiest thing.

226
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:54,231
[SPEAKER_38]: As you may know, many of the poles out there have transformers or other equipment on it, which at that time does not allow us to attach to those poles.

227
00:20:55,332 --> 00:21:03,614
[SPEAKER_38]: We're also limited by two, maybe three poles outside of the area where Jason would like to cover to attach to a utility pole.

228
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:09,216
[SPEAKER_38]: Once we do find the right utility pole, we have to complete our location design plan.

229
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:14,557
[SPEAKER_38]: Part of the location design plan is to ensure that all ADA requirements are reviewed and met.

230
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:18,579
[SPEAKER_38]: And at that point, we have our design completed.

231
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:21,059
[SPEAKER_38]: We submit applications into the utility companies.

232
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:23,620
[SPEAKER_38]: The utility companies then take our applications,

233
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:29,784
[SPEAKER_38]: review them, and get back to us with any work that needs to be done to the poll to make it ready for our attachment.

234
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:36,631
[SPEAKER_38]: Once the poll is ready for our attachment, we're able to go to the local municipality for our permitting, which is where we are at this point.

235
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:42,296
[SPEAKER_38]: And now I'd like to turn it over to our IRS expert, Dr. Eric Swanson.

236
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, everyone.

237
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:48,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for attending.

238
00:21:49,586 --> 00:21:56,250
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Eric Swanson, and I'm here to talk to you about safety and health effects of this new technology.

239
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:01,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So as was mentioned by Mike at the beginning, I'm a professor of physics at the University of Pittsburgh.

240
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,856
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also a fellow of the American Physical Society.

241
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:09,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, and I'm a former resident of Dorchester.

242
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:15,082
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to stress that I'm going to be presenting the consensus scientific view

243
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:19,147
[SPEAKER_08]: on health and safety aspects of this technology.

244
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:27,890
[SPEAKER_08]: In no way am I a fringe person and I don't hold fringe views in terms of science or politics for that matter.

245
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide, please.

246
00:22:30,831 --> 00:22:36,473
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you probably know, cell phones receive and transmit electromagnetic waves.

247
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:41,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Those waves can be described by different numbers like frequency or a wavelength or energy.

248
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:45,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you consider them all in total, we call that thing the spectrum.

249
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:50,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So this figure here on the left shows the spectrum for electromagnetic waves.

250
00:22:51,355 --> 00:22:53,296
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're familiar with parts of this.

251
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:57,059
[SPEAKER_08]: So for instance, you see the rainbow there, that's the visible part of the spectrum.

252
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you go higher in frequency or energy, you hit UV or x-rays.

253
00:23:02,443 --> 00:23:07,067
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go down lower, you hit microwaves or radio waves, et cetera.

254
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:08,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide, please.

255
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:16,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to show you what we're talking about, this green blob is about where 5G sits in this spectrum.

256
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,323
[SPEAKER_08]: So next slide, please.

257
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:27,204
[SPEAKER_08]: That green blob, or where 5G is, is about a factor of 30,000 below what I've colored red in this slide.

258
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:30,605
[SPEAKER_08]: The red area is called ionizing radiation.

259
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:36,806
[SPEAKER_08]: That radiation is special in that it's energetic enough that it can strip electrons from atoms.

260
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:39,547
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it does that, it can damage tissue.

261
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide, please.

262
00:23:43,203 --> 00:23:48,045
[SPEAKER_08]: In contrast, 5G is part of what's called the non-ionizing spectrum.

263
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:50,046
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's indicated in green here.

264
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:58,129
[SPEAKER_08]: That radiation, those waves, those electromagnetic waves, are not energetic enough to strip electrons from atoms.

265
00:23:58,469 --> 00:24:03,471
[SPEAKER_08]: So they don't create ions, and it can't cause damage to biological cells like DNA.

266
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:09,473
[SPEAKER_08]: And as an aside, it doesn't matter how intense that radiation is, and it doesn't matter how long

267
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,792
[SPEAKER_08]: the exposure is to that radiation.

268
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:13,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide, please.

269
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:17,656
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're probably familiar with this at an intuitive level.

270
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:27,704
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, if you sit inside, outside of the sun, outside of the sun's rays, and you have a light on, that light emits visible radiation.

271
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:32,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Similarly, a monitor emits visible radiation.

272
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:39,233
[SPEAKER_08]: And that visible radiation doesn't cause your skin to tan, and it doesn't give you sunburn, and it doesn't damage your tissue.

273
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:49,417
[SPEAKER_08]: unlike ultraviolet radiation, which as you know, can tan your skin or give you sunburns, which is up in the ionizing part of the spectrum.

274
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:50,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide, please.

275
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and here, by the way, at the bottom, I'm indicating a few more things.

276
00:24:57,742 --> 00:25:02,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So 5G is there near microwave radiation, that's in your microwave oven.

277
00:25:02,726 --> 00:25:04,647
[SPEAKER_08]: 4G is a little bit lower and radio is a bit lower.

278
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:08,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this non-ionizing radiation doesn't do nothing.

279
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:11,200
[SPEAKER_08]: What it does do is heat things.

280
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,081
[SPEAKER_08]: So a microwave oven will heat water.

281
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:19,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, the only verified biological effect of all non-ionizing radiation is heating.

282
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:21,525
[SPEAKER_08]: So next slide, please.

283
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:27,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, because of this heating, because of this heating effect, the FCC regulates it.

284
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:35,251
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want people to be getting too much heat from a cell phone or any infrastructure that exists out there.

285
00:25:35,682 --> 00:25:39,224
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are regulations in place to protect the public.

286
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:46,747
[SPEAKER_08]: These regulations are made in consultation with national advising bodies and the international community as well.

287
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:48,969
[SPEAKER_08]: They are extremely strict.

288
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:50,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I've looked at how they do this.

289
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:59,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Levels are set at approximately 1 50th of the level to produce any effect whatsoever in animal experiments.

290
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:04,156
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could give you the numbers, but just to set the scale here, this heating,

291
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:14,834
[SPEAKER_08]: This heating pad that I show, a hot water bottle that I show on the slide, produces about 50 times more heat than is permittable under FCC regulations.

292
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:19,417
[SPEAKER_08]: If this hot water bottle were regulated by the FCC, it would be illegal.

293
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:24,239
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to make it obvious, I of course like the heat that my hot water bottle produces.

294
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,440
[SPEAKER_08]: That feels nice.

295
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:27,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Next slide, please.

296
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:37,358
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be assured that the FCC regularly reviews its regulations and updates them to keep track of technology.

297
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:45,443
[SPEAKER_08]: This little thing in blue shows you a recent reevaluation that the Food and Drug Administration did on 5G technology.

298
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:56,010
[SPEAKER_08]: They examined more than 100 recent studies and they determined that the current level of regulations is perfectly adequate to protect the health of the public.

299
00:26:56,611 --> 00:26:58,692
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last little point I'd like to make is that

300
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,751
[SPEAKER_08]: because we're talking about 5G.

301
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:12,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Typical 5G small cells produce electromagnetic waves that are about a factor of 250 below those already strict FCC regulations.

302
00:27:13,156 --> 00:27:14,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike.

303
00:27:17,557 --> 00:27:18,558
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Dr. Swanson.

304
00:27:18,578 --> 00:27:23,560
[SPEAKER_27]: So this slide shows the applications, but the chair went through these and I think they've been broken into

305
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:25,264
[SPEAKER_27]: the same groups.

306
00:27:25,304 --> 00:27:29,367
[SPEAKER_27]: This is just so you can see the breakdown of those groups.

307
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:31,589
[SPEAKER_27]: Slide, please.

308
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:41,817
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for your attention, and we'll all remain available throughout the hearing tonight for questions or additional information if anyone has questions for Verizon.

309
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:42,337
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

310
00:27:55,522 --> 00:27:58,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to open up questions from the committee.

311
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,525
[SPEAKER_11]: So Alicia, Marianne, and Paul.

312
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:11,851
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll start with one.

313
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:32,141
[SPEAKER_16]: believe that this was part of the requirement, but I feel that it would be helpful to hear you say this, that each of the polls that you're looking, that all of these right now are intended to go on polls, that's obvious from the names of the locations, that each of the polls has been checked, that it is in safe and good condition.

314
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:38,745
[SPEAKER_16]: We have over time had polls that looked kind of perilous and need to get replaced,

315
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:47,547
[SPEAKER_16]: and that you've done due diligence, the National Grid has done due diligence, that the polls in this list are considered safe.

316
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:50,869
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm calling.

317
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:53,091
[SPEAKER_38]: Hi, Alicia.

318
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,192
[SPEAKER_38]: I can take that question.

319
00:28:54,552 --> 00:29:04,600
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, when we submit an application to the, they do go out and do an OCALC report to make sure that the, anything we're adding to the poll can be handled by the existing poll.

320
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,522
[SPEAKER_38]: If not, they would request us to do

321
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:16,245
[SPEAKER_27]: Sean, I think you cut out that last part.

322
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,565
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe you want to repeat your last couple of sentences.

323
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:20,746
[SPEAKER_27]: If not, what are you supposed to do?

324
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Your sound isn't working right.

325
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:29,949
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard the first half of your answer and I see your mouth moving again.

326
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:31,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

327
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:37,892
[SPEAKER_38]: Hello?

328
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:40,493
[SPEAKER_38]: I can hear you now.

329
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:51,414
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, so when we submit an application to the utilities, they go out and do an OCALC report, which is a structural report to ensure that the pole can withstand anything that we're adding to the location.

330
00:29:52,595 --> 00:30:00,500
[SPEAKER_38]: If there is an issue with the pole, like you say, it might be leaning or isn't adequate to hold our materials, they will ask for a pole replacement.

331
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,263
[SPEAKER_38]: We would put a new pole in that would handle the loading that we're adding to the pole.

332
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:12,440
[SPEAKER_16]: And none of these are double poles, that was one of our metrics requirements.

333
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:19,645
[SPEAKER_38]: We would not install anything on a double pole, no.

334
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:21,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

335
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:27,790
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions if I could.

336
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,572
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, go ahead, Paul.

337
00:30:30,892 --> 00:30:31,152
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

338
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:36,896
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, I was looking through some of the, I actually have some of the old paper applications that I think were filed initially

339
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:44,811
[SPEAKER_37]: And as I was looking through them, a lot of the applications that I looked at, they were mounted on top of the poles.

340
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:48,373
[SPEAKER_37]: Is that usually the standard practice for mounting this equipment?

341
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:51,995
[SPEAKER_37]: Or are there going to be some that are going to be flush mounted to the side of the poles?

342
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:52,335
[SPEAKER_37]: Do you know?

343
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,798
[SPEAKER_38]: So the requirements are determined by the utility.

344
00:30:58,818 --> 00:31:03,661
[SPEAKER_38]: And in Medford, National Grid does allow us to attach to the top of the pole.

345
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:06,042
[SPEAKER_38]: That's where we would like to be if we can.

346
00:31:07,037 --> 00:31:10,880
[SPEAKER_38]: In some cases, we may attach equipment into the communication space.

347
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,304
[SPEAKER_38]: It would be on a standoff off of the pole, and the antennas would sit on that bracket off of the pole.

348
00:31:16,365 --> 00:31:17,946
[SPEAKER_38]: They wouldn't be flush mounted to the pole.

349
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:19,787
[SPEAKER_37]: OK.

350
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:27,133
[SPEAKER_37]: And some of the equipment, I know the meter socket and some of the other equipment that are shown, again, these diagrams.

351
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:30,976
[SPEAKER_37]: Lowest level above a sidewalk is 8 feet.

352
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,857
[SPEAKER_37]: You won't be going any closer than 8 feet.

353
00:31:32,897 --> 00:31:33,438
[SPEAKER_37]: Is that correct?

354
00:31:35,457 --> 00:31:35,777
[SPEAKER_38]: Correct.

355
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:39,158
[SPEAKER_38]: That is set forth by the utility company that the meter has to be at 8 feet.

356
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:41,359
[SPEAKER_37]: OK.

357
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,781
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think I just have one other question for now.

358
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:51,983
[SPEAKER_37]: I noticed, again, in these packets, there were, let's say, a couple of engineering programs.

359
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:56,245
[SPEAKER_37]: You have some calculations on our shear lows and bending moment design.

360
00:31:56,945 --> 00:32:04,388
[SPEAKER_37]: And the application, actually, every application I was looking at, letter F

361
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:10,292
[SPEAKER_37]: says part of the packet is a structural safety certification of the pole's equipment in the pole.

362
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:26,039
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's also required in our interim policy where you would have to, on page six, these have to be certified by a registered professional engineer that the pole location will safely support the pole's equipment.

363
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:31,001
[SPEAKER_37]: I didn't see anything that was certified by an engineer on any of these applications.

364
00:32:31,021 --> 00:32:32,921
[SPEAKER_37]: Has that changed at all?

365
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:33,982
[SPEAKER_37]: Have you updated that at all?

366
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:52,512
[SPEAKER_38]: We had submitted our OCALC reports that come from National Grid to meet that structural requirement.

367
00:32:55,834 --> 00:33:06,421
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I saw those, Sean, but I'm just wondering, are there any plans to get these certified just so we'll have, you know, that it will be certified by a registered design professional?

368
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:09,443
[SPEAKER_37]: We could certainly do that.

369
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,785
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make that request.

370
00:33:13,845 --> 00:33:14,566
[SPEAKER_37]: And again, that's,

371
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:20,678
[SPEAKER_37]: For a couple of reasons, as you know, Sean, it's listed as what's the pilot package you submitted.

372
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:25,341
[SPEAKER_37]: And also, that is a requirement under our interim policy we have with the city.

373
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:27,702
[SPEAKER_37]: So if we could put that in there, that would be good.

374
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:28,242
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

375
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:30,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul, I had a similar comment.

376
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:35,066
[SPEAKER_11]: The calculations are included, but they're not certified by a PE.

377
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:41,230
[SPEAKER_11]: And the committee can discuss how we want to address that.

378
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,212
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that could be conditioned.

379
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,809
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's something for us to think about.

380
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:51,370
[SPEAKER_11]: We can talk about that more later.

381
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:57,591
[SPEAKER_11]: I made a note of it as a potential condition, if that's how the committee moves.

382
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:03,372
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

383
00:34:03,712 --> 00:34:06,753
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Chairman, I also add a similar to that.

384
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:14,095
[SPEAKER_18]: I know our policy requires an affidavit of a radio frequency engineer or radio frequency safety officer.

385
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:19,073
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure I saw those with many of the applications.

386
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:42,553
[SPEAKER_18]: My other question is, in looking over some of the safety guidelines and some of the FCC regs, in some of your applications, the lowest point of the antenna is below the required or recommended 10 meters or 33 feet.

387
00:34:44,689 --> 00:34:49,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and that seems to be a safety guideline from the FCC.

388
00:34:50,353 --> 00:35:01,561
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm wondering if you are going to be addressing that because of the lower than 32 feet, it's really going against kind of one of the checkoff list guidelines.

389
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:06,284
[SPEAKER_18]: The safety.

390
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:12,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Sean or Verizon, do you have anything to say for that?

391
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,543
[SPEAKER_27]: I wonder if Dr. Swanson would care to address the height of the antenna issue.

392
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:21,766
Sure.

393
00:35:23,327 --> 00:35:23,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

394
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:31,615
[SPEAKER_08]: The amount of electromagnetic energy that you're exposed to is a function of how far you are from these antennas.

395
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:38,541
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, the FCC regulates, takes that into account when they make their regulations.

396
00:35:39,372 --> 00:35:58,077
[SPEAKER_08]: So generally speaking, if these antennas typically are about 20 feet above the sidewalk, and if you're below one, you'll receive, I want to get this right, about 0.4% of the limit of the FCC regulations.

397
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:07,179
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm looking at guidelines from the FCC, which is a local officials guide and one of the checklist

398
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:12,312
[SPEAKER_18]: is that the lowest point of the antenna will be at least 10 meters above the ground or 33 feet.

399
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:18,354
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's something I would like to put in.

400
00:36:18,754 --> 00:36:19,515
[SPEAKER_08]: It's even less.

401
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:27,598
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as I, I don't know if that applies to... Dr. Swanson, could you speak louder?

402
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, you're very quiet.

403
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:34,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I'll try to move my microphone closer to me.

404
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,162
[SPEAKER_15]: That's much better.

405
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:43,533
[SPEAKER_09]: So we complete with that response.

406
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Marianne, did they provide the information you're looking for?

407
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:58,143
[SPEAKER_27]: If I could address that also, I think that reference is not to a guide for small cells or any regulation.

408
00:36:58,924 --> 00:37:00,785
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a radio frequency guide, so.

409
00:37:01,526 --> 00:37:04,368
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a radio frequency guide, so it doesn't apply to small cells.

410
00:37:04,428 --> 00:37:09,511
[SPEAKER_27]: It was a draft, I don't know what the date on that is, sometime in the early 2000s, I think.

411
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,742
[SPEAKER_27]: It had to do with towers, not with small cells.

412
00:37:16,683 --> 00:37:21,146
[SPEAKER_18]: So a lot of these polls seem like they are higher than 33, but there are several that aren't.

413
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,827
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be my concern.

414
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:37,215
[SPEAKER_18]: And the affidavit piece regarding the radio frequency engineer, the radio frequency safety officer?

415
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:41,056
[SPEAKER_18]: that's required in our policy?

416
00:37:42,577 --> 00:38:07,945
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you what they, they submitted cover letters from, that states that they meet the standards, and it's signed by a Verizon representative, but I'm not sure, and this was something that was brought up a year ago too, I believe, whether or not it's considered an affidavit signed by a radio frequency professional.

417
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,268
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's, I think the policy was looking for.

418
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:30,280
[SPEAKER_11]: And Marianne, this is probably again, this is something similar to the PE certification, where if the committee so moves, it could be a condition to be addressed that in that manner, if the committee decides to move in that direction.

419
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,721
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've made a note of it.

420
00:38:34,923 --> 00:38:35,023
[SPEAKER_11]: The,

421
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:52,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Applications themselves, again, they did contain about a page and a half of statement with a diagram, making the statements that are required in the policy, but not necessarily signed off by an affidavit form signed off by radio frequency professional.

422
00:38:53,042 --> 00:39:00,128
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's something that there may need to be something done there, certainly.

423
00:39:02,437 --> 00:39:05,679
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Chairman, so we can maybe put this to bed at the hearing.

424
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:10,341
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think we object to an after-the-fact condition, but we do have Jason Flanagan here.

425
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:16,264
[SPEAKER_27]: I think he can address as to all these polls that they would comply completely with the federal requirements.

426
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:19,526
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'd ask Jason if he can answer that question, please.

427
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:20,706
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, thank you.

428
00:39:21,387 --> 00:39:27,010
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, everything we have proposed tonight complies with all FCC guidelines that have been laid forth to us.

429
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,712
[SPEAKER_27]: That's with respect to radio frequency energy levels, Jason?

430
00:39:32,845 --> 00:39:33,285
[SPEAKER_29]: That's correct.

431
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:33,966
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

432
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:35,646
[SPEAKER_27]: And you're a radio frequency professional.

433
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:37,147
[SPEAKER_29]: That's correct.

434
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,370
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

435
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:47,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

436
00:39:47,072 --> 00:39:47,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

437
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:50,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll ask my questions now.

438
00:39:50,874 --> 00:39:56,977
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think you've addressed a couple of them, but I'll just go through them here.

439
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:06,273
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things I was unclear on, are all of these antennas located within a shroud or some canister type enclosure?

440
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:07,934
[SPEAKER_11]: And are the wires concealed?

441
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:09,255
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the diagram showed wires.

442
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:13,978
[SPEAKER_11]: It was unclear if these are shrouded in a canister type enclosure.

443
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:25,605
[SPEAKER_11]: And related to these, and I've gone through all the applications, everything looks like it's the same equipment on existing utility poles.

444
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,286
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to confirm that that is the case.

445
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:31,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Sean, can you address this?

446
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,823
[SPEAKER_38]: They are all the same equipment on each utility pole.

447
00:40:33,843 --> 00:40:34,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

448
00:40:37,507 --> 00:40:43,973
[SPEAKER_11]: And are they located entirely within a shroud or a canister type enclosure, which the policy requires?

449
00:40:46,816 --> 00:40:48,538
[SPEAKER_38]: They are not located within a shroud.

450
00:40:48,558 --> 00:40:52,982
[SPEAKER_38]: These antennas cannot be located within a shroud or they don't perform.

451
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:20,630
[SPEAKER_11]: I just pulled my reference here.

452
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,651
[SPEAKER_11]: The first item under aesthetic requirements under the policy, and I'll just read it verbatim.

453
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:35,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Each small cell wireless infrastructure antenna shall be located entirely within a shroud or canister type enclosure.

454
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:47,741
[SPEAKER_27]: So, Mr chairman that's that's a requirement that would interfere with the operation of these facilities, so we would respectfully request to the extent that we can't do that a waiver from.

455
00:41:48,662 --> 00:41:56,328
[SPEAKER_27]: That requirement, because it has the effect of prohibiting us from providing this service, the the frequencies that these antennas operate at.

456
00:41:57,115 --> 00:42:00,017
[SPEAKER_27]: do not work with the kind of shrouds that you're talking about there.

457
00:42:00,057 --> 00:42:06,341
[SPEAKER_27]: These antennas are designed to be visually low impact and they're located at the top of the pole.

458
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:15,226
[SPEAKER_27]: Sean showed a picture of these, but in terms of an actual shroud, that's not something that Verizon has been able to do with these antennas.

459
00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:28,227
[SPEAKER_27]: And I understand we did request that in the submission in the cover letter.

460
00:42:42,115 --> 00:42:49,880
[SPEAKER_27]: Sean, if you wanna give any more detail on the reason that requirement would prohibit us from providing the technology, that would probably be helpful.

461
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:57,540
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I mean, I think you said it, Mike, basically, the antennas go within a shroud.

462
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,483
[SPEAKER_38]: The signal's blocked, so they just don't work.

463
00:43:04,386 --> 00:43:11,472
[SPEAKER_38]: On our macro sites and larger sites, we can put those large antennas within RF-friendly shrouding, and the signal will go through them.

464
00:43:11,653 --> 00:43:14,215
[SPEAKER_38]: But the small cells, these 5G small cells don't allow that.

465
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:19,957
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got the letter here, you are correct.

466
00:43:20,238 --> 00:43:22,378
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just read the portion of the letter.

467
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:40,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Verizon Wireless respectfully requests that the city waive the requirements on page three of the policy that establish a shrouding requirement, and that establish a diameter restriction on the antenna enclosure, and instead review the Verizon Wireless application using the FCC's definition of small cell wireless facility.

468
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:47,625
[SPEAKER_11]: which reads small cell wireless facility means a wireless facility that meets both of the following qualifications.

469
00:43:48,645 --> 00:43:59,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Each antenna could fit within an enclosure of no more than three cubic feet in volume and all other wireless equipment associated with the wireless facility is cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume.

470
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:15,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Following types of ancillary equipment are not included in the calculation of equipment volume, electrical meter, concealment elements, telecommunications, demarcation box, grounding equipment, power transfer switch, cutoff switch, vertical cable runs for the connection power and other services.

471
00:44:33,783 --> 00:44:39,248
[SPEAKER_11]: All equipment was confirmed, and you also confirmed that these wouldn't have any cooling fans.

472
00:44:39,508 --> 00:44:43,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we anticipate noise from any of these antennas?

473
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:49,336
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all the same equipment, so assuming they're all powered the same, we anticipate noise.

474
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:51,137
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure.

475
00:44:52,478 --> 00:44:56,121
[SPEAKER_38]: There should be no noise from these, and yeah, there's no cooling fans on these locations.

476
00:44:58,043 --> 00:45:00,225
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you say no noise, no detectable noise?

477
00:45:00,245 --> 00:45:02,126
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, everything is- No detectable noise.

478
00:45:16,152 --> 00:45:24,279
[SPEAKER_11]: When wireless facilities go on these utility poles, utility poles are primarily used to hang overhead wires, historically.

479
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:34,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Does placing wireless antennas on them interrupt or change the capabilities for service providers to provide wired service to their customers?

480
00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:37,189
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

481
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:59,779
[SPEAKER_11]: This question, you probably know this because you have been evaluating these poll locations, but many of them are within 20 to 30 feet of residential dwellings.

482
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:02,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of these dwellings have third stories on them.

483
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:12,803
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are some situations where the plane of the living space is at or near the plane of the antenna.

484
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:17,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you've spoken about EF emissions

485
00:46:18,283 --> 00:46:41,066
[SPEAKER_11]: the safety and the standards and things, but I was wondering if you could talk about that specific distance, 20 to 30 feet, and then prolonged exposure and other standards that are met regarding that, because you may have someone living in a space, confined to a space potentially, in a third floor bedroom,

486
00:46:41,846 --> 00:46:52,113
[SPEAKER_11]: and maybe 30 feet away from the antenna and experiencing whatever emissions they are experiencing from that distance for a prolonged period of time.

487
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:55,195
[SPEAKER_11]: So could someone speak to that concern?

488
00:46:56,036 --> 00:46:58,558
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll ask Dr. Swanson if he could please address that.

489
00:46:59,078 --> 00:46:59,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

490
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:09,045
[SPEAKER_26]: Dr. Swanson.

491
00:47:11,406 --> 00:47:12,267
[SPEAKER_26]: You're not coming through.

492
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,988
[SPEAKER_26]: Are you muted?

493
00:47:14,008 --> 00:47:25,458
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I'm not seeing him.

494
00:47:25,498 --> 00:47:27,960
[SPEAKER_27]: He might've gotten bounced off somehow.

495
00:47:28,561 --> 00:47:31,783
[SPEAKER_27]: Can we go back to that later when we can retrieve Dr. Swanson?

496
00:47:33,325 --> 00:47:33,645
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

497
00:47:37,377 --> 00:47:40,980
[SPEAKER_11]: The application indicates the expected life of the equipment is approximately two years.

498
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:51,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Could some please explain the end of life, excuse me, the end of life process for this equipment as it relates to the utility pole and the schedule of installation?

499
00:47:52,248 --> 00:48:00,233
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, if the rollout of this takes six months, is Verizon returning to remove the installed system 18 months later in the cycle?

500
00:48:06,057 --> 00:48:06,618
[SPEAKER_38]: We would go out

501
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,360
[SPEAKER_38]: For our network, we would need to replace them.

502
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,283
[SPEAKER_38]: But if there's an issue with the location, we would go out and replace them.

503
00:48:16,483 --> 00:48:19,465
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not like the end of life would mean the end of the site.

504
00:48:19,905 --> 00:48:23,307
[SPEAKER_38]: Once the site becomes part of our network, we would always want it to be part of our network.

505
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:31,333
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I understand you correctly, you're monitoring the equipment.

506
00:48:31,693 --> 00:48:37,497
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it's faltering nearing its end of life or whatever, then it would be scheduled for replacement?

507
00:48:39,198 --> 00:48:39,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

508
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:46,575
[SPEAKER_11]: And would the equipment change in any specification during a replacement such as this?

509
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:55,864
[SPEAKER_38]: I, I couldn't say for sure if it would change yes or no, maybe kind of just depend on where the technology was at the time.

510
00:48:55,884 --> 00:48:58,907
[SPEAKER_38]: I can't see it changing too much from what's out there.

511
00:48:59,627 --> 00:49:05,493
[SPEAKER_38]: Um, but again, unless, uh, we know what's coming two years down the road, I can't tell you exactly what we would be changing it to.

512
00:49:10,482 --> 00:49:15,245
[SPEAKER_27]: So Mr. Chairman, I think Dr. Swanson is available if you want him to go back to that question.

513
00:49:15,725 --> 00:49:16,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'll go back one second.

514
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:18,426
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want, we'll finish up this question first.

515
00:49:18,486 --> 00:49:19,067
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, very good.

516
00:49:19,507 --> 00:49:20,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

517
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:33,855
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and just to be clear, and if you were to change equipment or the specifications would change, my understanding of the policy is that you would have to revisit this committee.

518
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,681
[SPEAKER_38]: If it was a requirement of the policy, yes, we would revisit the committee.

519
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:49,684
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, yeah, I think if it's the same equipment and you're replacing the exact same equipment, that's different than if you are bringing in new technology that you want to put in the same location.

520
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,126
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, that's hypothetical.

521
00:49:54,386 --> 00:49:55,086
[SPEAKER_11]: All that's hypothetical.

522
00:49:56,707 --> 00:50:02,028
[SPEAKER_38]: Yep, we would come back if there was a change of technology or equipment that was different than we had.

523
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:05,070
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so I'll go back to the other question.

524
00:50:07,055 --> 00:50:11,116
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of questions I think that can be kind of grouped in.

525
00:50:11,456 --> 00:50:14,317
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of these questions are the same questions I've heard from residents.

526
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:17,698
[SPEAKER_11]: So, okay.

527
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:29,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Question number four, while the professor was out, was many of these installations have residential dwellings within 20 or 30 feet of the pole location.

528
00:50:31,002 --> 00:50:32,783
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there are some third story,

529
00:50:34,057 --> 00:50:38,180
[SPEAKER_11]: situations where you have residential dwellings and third stories within 20 to 30 feet.

530
00:50:39,701 --> 00:50:54,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that you have distance and the emissions, you know, the risk goes down with distance in that 20 to 30 zone and prolonged exposure because you may end up with a situation where someone is

531
00:50:55,982 --> 00:50:56,782
[SPEAKER_11]: bound to their bed.

532
00:50:58,323 --> 00:51:10,828
[SPEAKER_11]: So what do the safety standards say for an individual who's in their home, they can't leave their bedroom, and that bedroom is on the third story and you're within 20 and 30 feet of one of these antennas?

533
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:19,912
[SPEAKER_11]: How do the safety standards address that prolonged exposure situation, even though it may be below your maximum permissible exposure limits?

534
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:22,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

535
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:24,434
[SPEAKER_08]: And sorry for the Zoom glitch there.

536
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:25,055
[SPEAKER_11]: It's OK.

537
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:37,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're up at the same height as an antenna, then you will be receiving more energy than if you were below it, for instance, because it tends to be directional.

538
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:42,023
[SPEAKER_08]: However, that's taken into account in the FCC standards.

539
00:51:42,063 --> 00:51:44,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So the figures that I quote you are worst case.

540
00:51:45,864 --> 00:51:47,985
[SPEAKER_08]: So in other words, it doesn't matter.

541
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:52,346
[SPEAKER_08]: It still has to apply by the, still have to live by the standards.

542
00:51:54,386 --> 00:51:55,807
[SPEAKER_08]: As for the time of this,

543
00:51:56,937 --> 00:52:02,998
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no time specification given in the FCC standards.

544
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:11,900
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, it doesn't matter if you live next to one of these things, or if you only pass it once a day on your commute or something like that.

545
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:19,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason for that is actually a physics principle that was understood by none other than Albert Einstein.

546
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:23,383
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to these thermal effects, there's no cumulative effect.

547
00:52:25,581 --> 00:52:31,526
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter how long you're exposed to this electromagnetic energy for.

548
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:56,531
[SPEAKER_27]: So, Dr. Swanson, just to be clear, if there was somebody who was bedridden, as the chair has asked, that would still, they would still be protected by the FCC regulations, compliance with those FCC regulations?

549
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:57,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

550
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:00,933
[SPEAKER_08]: They would be completely in compliance.

551
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:09,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And how close does one need to get before they would feel impacts or not be within standards?

552
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:19,858
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to basically climb the pole and hug the equipment to be going beyond FCC standards.

553
00:53:20,178 --> 00:53:31,901
[SPEAKER_08]: So for example, if you work on it, if you're a line worker and you need to adjust something in one of these small cell antennas, you're supposed to turn it off before you go and work on it.

554
00:53:33,302 --> 00:53:37,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I should stress again, though, that if you ask me personally, would I go and hug one of these things,

555
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:43,752
[SPEAKER_08]: that discomfort it might cause, because I have to climb a pole, there'd be no health effects.

556
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:50,718
[SPEAKER_08]: These limits are so strict that you'd have more effect on you than by taking your hat off, for instance, if you go outside.

557
00:53:50,738 --> 00:54:02,868
[SPEAKER_40]: Any other questions?

558
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:12,147
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to summarize so I understand and for the benefit of other folks here trying to understand this.

559
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:18,479
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're talking about thermal impacts.

560
00:54:19,628 --> 00:54:23,652
[SPEAKER_11]: and we're talking about proximity to the antenna.

561
00:54:23,672 --> 00:54:34,120
[SPEAKER_11]: And what you're stating is, is if you were right up against, your skin was on the antenna, then you would still be within the standards of a maximum permissible exposure.

562
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:40,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also you stated that time doesn't have an impact, so you could be exposed,

563
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:54,266
[SPEAKER_11]: at a distance of say 20 or 30 feet or closer for an extended prolonged period of time, and there would be no cumulative impact to the tissue of the body.

564
00:54:54,486 --> 00:54:55,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I understand that correctly?

565
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:56,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Have I summarized correctly?

566
00:54:57,328 --> 00:54:59,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir, but I should clarify just in case.

567
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:00,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Please.

568
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand how precise you want me to be.

569
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:05,112
[SPEAKER_08]: The second statement about time, absolutely true.

570
00:55:05,412 --> 00:55:09,814
[SPEAKER_08]: The first statement about how close you can exactly get, it depends on the equipment and so on.

571
00:55:10,194 --> 00:55:14,257
[SPEAKER_08]: A typical equipment, you can get within a couple feet.

572
00:55:14,557 --> 00:55:18,639
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about as precise as I want to get before you hit the FCC limit.

573
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:24,902
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe the diagram that was sent along

574
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,158
[SPEAKER_11]: You indicated eight and a half feet.

575
00:55:31,138 --> 00:55:32,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that zone away from the antenna?

576
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:34,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that sound correct, Verizon team?

577
00:55:37,259 --> 00:55:41,380
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just the diagram submitted, eight and a half feet.

578
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:47,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Up in the antenna is the end of the MPE limit zone.

579
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:52,142
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that diagram actually shows a rate.

580
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,202
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a few ranges there.

581
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:55,463
[SPEAKER_27]: One is I think 20 to 100%, if I'm not mistaken.

582
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:01,623
[SPEAKER_27]: and then one is less than, right?

583
00:56:02,184 --> 00:56:04,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think the green zone is 1% to 20%.

584
00:56:04,606 --> 00:56:07,428
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, and then what's the blue zone?

585
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:09,229
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have that in front of me, unfortunately.

586
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:10,990
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay, the blue zone is 20% to 100%.

587
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:18,436
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, so anything that's not in the blue or green zone is what Dr. Swanson was talking about when he talked about hugging the antenna.

588
00:56:18,456 --> 00:56:19,477
[SPEAKER_27]: If you're within the blue zone,

589
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:23,900
[SPEAKER_27]: you are still in compliance with the FCC regulations.

590
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:29,084
[SPEAKER_27]: In other words, that you have not been exposed at a greater amount than the FCC regulations permit.

591
00:56:29,965 --> 00:56:30,906
[SPEAKER_27]: That's why it's 20 to 100%.

592
00:56:31,046 --> 00:56:43,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Next question.

593
00:56:44,456 --> 00:56:48,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Since we're operating under federal law, federal order here, as well as the

594
00:56:49,550 --> 00:57:03,273
[SPEAKER_11]: the policy created by the city, what is the public's recourse if they believe that our emissions are beyond the MPE or maximum permissible exposure limits?

595
00:57:08,695 --> 00:57:12,195
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, belief wouldn't really have to do with it.

596
00:57:12,215 --> 00:57:13,316
[SPEAKER_27]: It would have to be a measurement.

597
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:17,977
[SPEAKER_27]: If someone were to measure and find that there was a noncompliance, Verizon would take that very seriously.

598
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:19,097
[SPEAKER_27]: Their licenses depend

599
00:57:19,974 --> 00:57:23,235
[SPEAKER_27]: on compliance with all of the FCC requirements.

600
00:57:24,195 --> 00:57:28,556
[SPEAKER_27]: They're very comfortable with this technology that it always does comply with those requirements.

601
00:57:28,616 --> 00:57:33,517
[SPEAKER_27]: But if someone were to come up with different information, they would wanna know about that.

602
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:37,839
[SPEAKER_27]: And anybody who wanted to would have the ability to file a complaint with the FCC about that.

603
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:47,581
[SPEAKER_11]: So the recourse, if a resident measured levels that they think are not compliant

604
00:57:48,224 --> 00:57:52,026
[SPEAKER_11]: then they would file a complaint with the FCC?

605
00:57:52,586 --> 00:57:53,246
[SPEAKER_27]: They could do that.

606
00:57:54,087 --> 00:57:56,028
[SPEAKER_11]: And what else could they do?

607
00:57:56,048 --> 00:57:56,548
[SPEAKER_27]: They could do that.

608
00:57:56,588 --> 00:58:03,531
[SPEAKER_27]: They could also go back to your committee because your requirements require us to comply with FCC regulations.

609
00:58:05,032 --> 00:58:11,395
[SPEAKER_27]: So they've got both local recourse and federal recourse, and they would contact Verizon and give them that information.

610
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:12,135
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, I can tell you

611
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:19,111
[SPEAKER_27]: that doesn't happen, but if someone, if it were to happen hypothetically, that's what people would be able to do.

612
00:58:19,832 --> 00:58:20,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

613
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:45,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any third party testing post installation to confirm that the installations are indeed meeting the RF emission standards?

614
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:56,423
[SPEAKER_27]: Could you mind repeating the question there, Mr. Chairman?

615
00:58:57,003 --> 00:58:57,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

616
00:58:57,924 --> 00:59:00,284
[SPEAKER_11]: The question is, after

617
00:59:05,169 --> 00:59:16,732
[SPEAKER_11]: After installation, is there a third party testing or any testing to confirm that the actual installed locations are under the limits for our permissions?

618
00:59:23,633 --> 00:59:29,674
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't believe there's a routine checking of individual sites, but they do constantly monitor their sites.

619
00:59:30,074 --> 00:59:32,895
[SPEAKER_27]: And if the equipment was not operating the way it was supposed to operate,

620
00:59:33,417 --> 00:59:37,323
[SPEAKER_27]: they would have a maintenance check and go out there and address it.

621
00:59:38,164 --> 00:59:46,437
[SPEAKER_27]: Jason may be able to give us a little more detail on what happens if he gets a signal that something's not working at a cell site.

622
00:59:50,642 --> 00:59:55,088
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, if we have if we have alarms that go off in the switch, if there's a problem with our equipment.

623
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:58,011
[SPEAKER_29]: So we usually have a tech go out and confirm it.

624
00:59:58,151 --> 01:00:05,781
[SPEAKER_29]: And in this case, we would probably also need someone with one of our riggers with a bucket truck to go out and check the equipment.

625
01:00:13,795 --> 01:00:22,738
[SPEAKER_11]: But there isn't any sort of post-construction, post-installation protocol to confirm basically what our design requirements?

626
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:27,219
[SPEAKER_29]: Welcome, Milo.

627
01:00:27,479 --> 01:00:31,321
[SPEAKER_29]: These installations are very, as you said, they're all similar.

628
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:31,981
[SPEAKER_29]: They're all the same.

629
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:33,421
[SPEAKER_29]: We know how they're going to propagate.

630
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:35,442
[SPEAKER_29]: The equipment is the same and we know the maximum.

631
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:38,005
[SPEAKER_29]: propagation of the equipment.

632
01:00:38,045 --> 01:00:59,309
[SPEAKER_29]: So as you saw on the diagram you were holding up earlier, that diagram for safety is if the site is operating at max power with the max number of users on it, and they would actually have to be kind of far away because the signal would be as powered up as possible trying to hit them at the limits of its coverage.

633
01:01:00,529 --> 01:01:03,350
[SPEAKER_29]: So that is the absolute maximum

634
01:01:04,435 --> 01:01:08,536
[SPEAKER_29]: limit of safety exposure, and I can't exceed that diagram.

635
01:01:08,636 --> 01:01:21,460
[SPEAKER_29]: So we're not... We've done all our testing beforehand, and we do not have any concern for a site to be unsafe in that regard.

636
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:33,723
[SPEAKER_27]: The equipment is also certified to manufacturer standards, so that is built into the design of the equipment before it's sold.

637
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:38,991
[SPEAKER_27]: They've conducted all those tests on the equipment, the manufacturers would.

638
01:01:42,191 --> 01:01:43,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, understood, understood.

639
01:01:44,052 --> 01:01:51,353
[SPEAKER_11]: I come from a world where specifications are always tested post installation and post construction.

640
01:01:51,993 --> 01:01:59,795
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a little, a little strange to hear that we have a design standards for equipment and the equipment goes up and there's no follow up testing.

641
01:02:01,683 --> 01:02:06,925
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to understand that a little bit more because you have a piece of equipment that you've tested in a lab, I'm sure.

642
01:02:06,945 --> 01:02:29,791
[SPEAKER_11]: And the purpose of testing post-installation would be to confirm the laboratory results, as well as see if there's anything interrupting the functioning of the equipment, whether it may be other power, other electromagnetic sources, potentially.

643
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:35,335
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, that's something maybe the committee wants to discuss further.

644
01:02:35,355 --> 01:02:42,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Those were my questions.

645
01:02:51,006 --> 01:02:52,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions from the committee?

646
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:59,292
[SPEAKER_11]: At the moment, there'll be more time when we get into the census specific, but.

647
01:03:00,372 --> 01:03:01,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary Ann, Alicia, or Paul.

648
01:03:01,934 --> 01:03:07,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

649
01:03:07,403 --> 01:03:14,314
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so we're gonna move to the general non-site-specific public comments.

650
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:17,318
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna open the floor to comments from the public.

651
01:03:17,738 --> 01:03:21,720
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have questions for Verizon, please direct your questions to me, the chair.

652
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:26,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Before, I did say in the summary that I would call on voices in favor.

653
01:03:26,783 --> 01:03:30,865
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a couple of city council members here attending this meeting.

654
01:03:31,285 --> 01:03:38,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to call on them first to speak during the comment period.

655
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:43,372
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not sure, let's see, we've got Councilor Marks here.

656
01:03:44,328 --> 01:03:47,289
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think I saw President Caraviello here as well.

657
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:51,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Councilor Marks, you have your hand up.

658
01:03:52,051 --> 01:03:53,172
[SPEAKER_25]: I do, can you hear me?

659
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:54,792
[SPEAKER_11]: I can, hello.

660
01:03:55,233 --> 01:04:08,038
[SPEAKER_11]: So why don't we just confirm Amanda and Dave, could you guys confirm any other councilors who may wish to speak and we can go ahead and hear from Councilor Marks and then after councilors we'll go to folks in favor.

661
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:25,055
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Tim, and I would respectfully ask that, whereas I've received hundreds of emails and phone calls over the past year and a half, that I'd be allotted more than two minutes to make my presentation on behalf of the residents

662
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,756
[SPEAKER_25]: of this community that took the time to reach out to me.

663
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:30,096
[SPEAKER_25]: So I respectfully would request that.

664
01:04:30,556 --> 01:04:34,657
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to thank the ad hoc committee members for their due diligence on this.

665
01:04:35,197 --> 01:04:38,458
[SPEAKER_25]: I also want to recognize a few of my colleagues in city government.

666
01:04:39,078 --> 01:04:46,140
[SPEAKER_25]: President Caviello is on the call, as well as Councilor George Scott Pelley and Representative Paul Donato.

667
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:53,662
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, just briefly, at the beginning of the presentation, I heard the words uttered

668
01:04:54,163 --> 01:04:58,766
[SPEAKER_25]: we can't consider health concerns when discussing the applications.

669
01:04:59,527 --> 01:05:15,057
[SPEAKER_25]: And let me just say in my 26 years in city government in this community, I find that to be outrageous, that health concerns cannot be discussed or considered by residents or a city public entity.

670
01:05:17,153 --> 01:05:28,957
[SPEAKER_25]: If I could also, I appreciate the knowledge that we have through our building commissioner, city engineer, community development director, and the board of health.

671
01:05:29,938 --> 01:05:36,020
[SPEAKER_25]: However, I would say that I think it would be a great opportunity

672
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:47,167
[SPEAKER_25]: for the city of Meffitt to have their own experts as well on the subjects as which was mentioned by the Verizon experts that we heard from.

673
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:59,915
[SPEAKER_25]: As a member of the city council, I am concerned that corporate greed and commercial benefits of 5G will outweigh the potential long-term health effects of 5G on our residents.

674
01:06:01,255 --> 01:06:03,697
[SPEAKER_25]: 5G will substantially increase resident exposure

675
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:07,284
[SPEAKER_25]: to radio frequency electromagnetic fields.

676
01:06:08,106 --> 01:06:11,557
[SPEAKER_25]: This has been proven to be harmful for humans and the environment.

677
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:38,977
[SPEAKER_25]: we should support the recommendations of the 250 scientists and medical doctors who signed the 5G appeal that calls for an immediate moratorium on the deployment of 5G and demand our government officials fund the research needed to adopt biologically based exposure limits that protect the health and safety of our residents and our environment.

678
01:06:40,104 --> 01:06:46,007
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to just call upon an article that I read from the Americans for Responsible Technology.

679
01:06:47,048 --> 01:06:55,012
[SPEAKER_25]: And this is one segment of the article, but the article is 5G technology versus science and freedom of choice.

680
01:06:55,970 --> 01:07:14,680
[SPEAKER_25]: And it goes on to state, and I quote, human exposure guidelines from radio frequency microwave radiation used by the FCC are more than 20 years old and address only thermal, not biological impacts of exposure, which have now been firmly established.

681
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,803
[SPEAKER_25]: The guidelines have been the subject of an open FCC doc.

682
01:07:20,655 --> 01:07:28,078
[SPEAKER_25]: docket since 2013 with no resolution, creating an uncertain regulatory environment.

683
01:07:29,197 --> 01:07:54,680
[SPEAKER_25]: Over the last 20 years, a robust body of independent science has emerged showing significant biological impacts from exposure to radiofrequency microwave radiation, including clear evidence of cancer, neurological and cognitive harm, heart abnormalities, reproductive effects, and microwave sickness, among other serious health problems.

684
01:07:55,903 --> 01:08:06,549
[SPEAKER_25]: Populations, especially at risk include pregnant women, children, the elderly, individuals with implanted medical devices or cardiac or neurological problems.

685
01:08:09,471 --> 01:08:13,033
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a couple of questions I have regarding the policy.

686
01:08:14,214 --> 01:08:23,860
[SPEAKER_25]: And I raised these at the last city council meeting and the city council voted unanimously to put out nine different amendments on my resolution.

687
01:08:24,675 --> 01:08:45,102
[SPEAKER_25]: But my first question is, in the city's interim policy, under the application process, it states, for residential areas, guidelines on structure heights and lengths of minimum setback rules from dwellings, parks or playgrounds, or similar recreational areas.

688
01:08:45,862 --> 01:08:53,045
[SPEAKER_25]: So my question to the committee is, what are the minimum dwelling setback rules set forth in the interim policy?

689
01:08:57,612 --> 01:08:58,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

690
01:08:58,532 --> 01:09:00,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe there are any set in the policy.

691
01:09:00,953 --> 01:09:03,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the policy leaves it open for that, but I didn't see any in there.

692
01:09:04,695 --> 01:09:11,097
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so that would be the first question that I leave for discussion for your committee, Mr. Chair.

693
01:09:12,297 --> 01:09:16,439
[SPEAKER_25]: Also included in the city's interim policy is the following language.

694
01:09:17,295 --> 01:09:34,343
[SPEAKER_25]: description as to why the desired location is superior to other similar locations from a community perspective, including number one, visual aspects, number two, proximity to residential dwellings, schools, parks, or playgrounds.

695
01:09:35,703 --> 01:09:43,607
[SPEAKER_25]: If you go into the Verizon application, which I had the opportunity to, and look under their response for location selection criteria,

696
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:50,736
[SPEAKER_25]: They list, and I won't read it all, a laundry list of reasons why these are great locations.

697
01:09:51,257 --> 01:09:56,561
[SPEAKER_25]: And at the bottom it states, it is not directly adjacent to a park or playground.

698
01:09:57,482 --> 01:10:00,424
[SPEAKER_25]: And for some reason, does not talk about a dwelling.

699
01:10:01,025 --> 01:10:06,970
[SPEAKER_25]: So I was just wondering if the committee had the opportunity to look at the location selection criteria

700
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:15,426
[SPEAKER_25]: and why Verizon omitted dwellings from the reason why they selected the criteria.

701
01:10:15,947 --> 01:10:17,268
[SPEAKER_25]: Has that been looked at Mr. Chair?

702
01:10:19,589 --> 01:10:29,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I know personally I've looked at each and every location and I have concerns with many of them regarding proximity to schools, parks and dwellings.

703
01:10:30,088 --> 01:10:31,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so the concern is there.

704
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:37,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure what the my fellow committee members have for concerns, but I certainly do.

705
01:10:39,016 --> 01:10:52,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, there's the information that was provided, uh, had more to do with the, um, the polls themselves in the locations, alternate locations for the polls, as you may have seen Council Mars, right?

706
01:10:52,873 --> 01:11:11,190
[SPEAKER_25]: I just find it, Mr. Chair, ironic that the city interim policy states there's only two aspects, and one is proximity to residential dwellings, schools, parks, and they omit in their letter under the location selection criteria to add residential dwellings.

707
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:13,733
[SPEAKER_25]: They only talk about schools, parks, and playgrounds.

708
01:11:14,113 --> 01:11:15,675
[SPEAKER_25]: So I find that kind of ironic.

709
01:11:16,395 --> 01:11:31,483
[SPEAKER_25]: considering that, as you mentioned, Mr. Chair, many of these locations are within yards of homes, within yards of bedrooms, within yards of where children play and children sleep, as well as seniors and so forth.

710
01:11:32,603 --> 01:11:45,290
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, Mr. Chair, in the city's interim policy under the prohibitions section, it states, no small cell wireless installation shall be installed on poles that do not meet the sidewalk

711
01:11:45,758 --> 01:11:47,979
[SPEAKER_25]: clearance requirements and standards.

712
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:58,882
[SPEAKER_25]: This includes horizontal and vertical clearances for pedestrian passage, applicable requirements and standards may include, but are not limited to ADA.

713
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:09,166
[SPEAKER_25]: My question to the chair is, has the city approved each installation for meeting the sidewalk clearance requirements that are spelled out within the interim policy?

714
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,601
[SPEAKER_11]: They have been reviewed for clearance.

715
01:12:12,981 --> 01:12:20,265
[SPEAKER_11]: So I reviewed them for horizontal clearance for passage, and I reviewed them for passing vertical passing distance.

716
01:12:20,305 --> 01:12:22,987
[SPEAKER_11]: So the eight and a half feet was mentioned.

717
01:12:24,848 --> 01:12:36,314
[SPEAKER_11]: So those aspects of signs and vertical clearance, as well as pedestrian passing clearance, I did review those.

718
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:40,437
[SPEAKER_25]: And does that include a review of ADA as well, Mr. Chair?

719
01:12:41,037 --> 01:12:50,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Well that is ADA so ADA would, you know, the context that ADA is applied here would be pedestrian passage on the ground.

720
01:12:52,637 --> 01:12:58,721
[SPEAKER_11]: The pole can't be in a place that's obstructing the pedestrian from passing.

721
01:12:59,661 --> 01:13:04,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Most utility poles in the city, because they go through a grant location process, that is the case.

722
01:13:05,805 --> 01:13:10,227
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did look specifically at the proposals.

723
01:13:10,948 --> 01:13:17,632
[SPEAKER_11]: The biggest concern that I had in regards to these items that you're discussing is proximity to residential structures.

724
01:13:19,386 --> 01:13:28,832
[SPEAKER_11]: that really was the one, you know, many of these, as you may have noticed, 20 to 30 feet within residential structures, which feels very close to me, so.

725
01:13:30,353 --> 01:13:31,634
[SPEAKER_25]: I appreciate that response.

726
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:34,736
[SPEAKER_25]: My last just interim policy question is,

727
01:13:35,543 --> 01:13:41,305
[SPEAKER_25]: Under the current interim policy, the applicant is required to provide a certificate of liability insurance.

728
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:48,628
[SPEAKER_25]: I noticed in going through several of the applications that the Verizon policies have expired.

729
01:13:49,348 --> 01:13:51,089
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that something the committee is reviewing?

730
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,230
[SPEAKER_11]: It's bringing to my attention now.

731
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:58,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they may be expired.

732
01:13:58,171 --> 01:14:03,453
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something we would need to have addressed to confirm that

733
01:14:04,442 --> 01:14:08,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Those certificates indicate what policies the entity has in place.

734
01:14:08,686 --> 01:14:12,330
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'd have to get updated versions of those certificates.

735
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:21,339
[SPEAKER_25]: So first hearing, but we typically hold a public hearing when portions of the application are not complete?

736
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:32,411
[SPEAKER_11]: The applications were complete when they were submitted to the mayor's office, when they were submitted over a year ago.

737
01:14:33,151 --> 01:14:40,937
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think things like the expiration of the certificate of insurance is something that has happened as the time has passed.

738
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:47,582
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is something that the committee could consider if we move this way to condition that.

739
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:57,646
[SPEAKER_11]: up-to-date certificate of insurance, basically.

740
01:14:59,306 --> 01:15:00,986
[SPEAKER_25]: And I thank the committee for their time.

741
01:15:10,868 --> 01:15:19,650
[SPEAKER_25]: I would respectfully add that the committee's radio frequency regarding proximity to dwellings and a host of other issues that are out there that residents have in this community.

742
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:21,491
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, I thank you for your time.

743
01:15:32,354 --> 01:15:32,974
[SPEAKER_25]: effort on this.

744
01:15:33,215 --> 01:15:33,415
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

745
01:15:36,316 --> 01:15:38,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Because amongst you were breaking up a little bit at the end there.

746
01:15:39,098 --> 01:15:49,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I know some of it was outgoing remarks, but if you had elements that you need to make sure that I get that in the last couple sentences, I think you may want to repeat them.

747
01:15:56,187 --> 01:15:56,447
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr Chair,

748
01:15:57,992 --> 01:16:02,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you were breaking up in the last couple sentences that you said.

749
01:16:02,795 --> 01:16:07,819
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there are things you'd like to repeat in the last few sentences, that would be good.

750
01:16:07,839 --> 01:16:09,660
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anybody was able to hear you.

751
01:16:11,361 --> 01:16:12,222
[SPEAKER_25]: I apologize.

752
01:16:12,362 --> 01:16:13,783
[SPEAKER_25]: It's my Verizon connection.

753
01:16:18,786 --> 01:16:19,487
[SPEAKER_25]: And I apologize.

754
01:16:21,442 --> 01:16:34,928
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Chair, my closing statement was more or less that I hope the committee on small cells does its due diligence and reflects upon the wishes of this community and also looks into their own expert.

755
01:16:42,711 --> 01:16:43,551
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

756
01:16:45,172 --> 01:16:47,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

757
01:16:48,903 --> 01:16:57,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to, before moving on, I would just like to address the framework that the city has put in here.

758
01:16:58,307 --> 01:17:11,491
[SPEAKER_11]: The federal laws surrounding this really sort of prohibit the city from stopping this, prohibiting this effectively, materially prohibiting it.

759
01:17:12,072 --> 01:17:12,652
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have,

760
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:18,132
[SPEAKER_11]: our legal counsel on the line if committee members would like more information regarding that.

761
01:17:20,354 --> 01:17:21,054
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very interesting.

762
01:17:21,594 --> 01:17:29,539
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, are there other counselors who would like to speak in the general public comment period?

763
01:17:29,559 --> 01:17:41,125
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you, Councilor Marks.

764
01:17:43,086 --> 01:17:53,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Dave and Amanda, we can go ahead and I'd like to ask people in favor to speak first.

765
01:17:54,732 --> 01:17:56,673
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll open that up now.

766
01:17:57,794 --> 01:18:04,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, if you want to take them one by one and you think the order that they were received and we'll give folks two minutes.

767
01:18:07,259 --> 01:18:07,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

768
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:07,899
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

769
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:09,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

770
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,821
[SPEAKER_17]: So I believe, oh, sorry.

771
01:18:11,476 --> 01:18:19,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I was gonna say, and if folks could please introduce themselves and state their name and address for the record.

772
01:18:19,662 --> 01:18:20,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

773
01:18:23,144 --> 01:18:32,551
[SPEAKER_17]: And I apologize if maybe one person came before another, but I tried to capture kind of folks as they raised their hands.

774
01:18:32,771 --> 01:18:36,854
[SPEAKER_17]: So the first person on the list that I have here is Delphine Picard.

775
01:18:44,015 --> 01:18:46,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, sorry, I'm having some trouble.

776
01:18:47,217 --> 01:18:47,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?

777
01:18:48,938 --> 01:18:49,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

778
01:18:49,579 --> 01:18:50,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

779
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:53,842
[SPEAKER_14]: You said you wanted people in favor to speak first.

780
01:18:54,222 --> 01:18:54,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that correct?

781
01:18:55,583 --> 01:19:00,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but the more that I think about this, I'm not sure how we're gonna know if folks are in favor or not.

782
01:19:00,746 --> 01:19:03,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So if it's out of order, that's okay.

783
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:05,450
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll just try to keep it to two minutes.

784
01:19:06,571 --> 01:19:07,691
[SPEAKER_14]: So should I go ahead maybe?

785
01:19:08,352 --> 01:19:08,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Or?

786
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:10,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead, if you're in opposition, go ahead.

787
01:19:10,473 --> 01:19:11,575
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll just make fun of it.

788
01:19:11,635 --> 01:19:12,597
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm glad we're recording this.

789
01:19:12,617 --> 01:19:13,499
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

790
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,365
[SPEAKER_14]: So my name is Delphine Picard, and I'm a Medford resident since 2007.

791
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:17,387
[SPEAKER_14]: I am the mother of three children.

792
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:27,966
[SPEAKER_14]: And I am extremely concerned about the installation of the 5G antennas over Medford.

793
01:19:28,727 --> 01:19:39,058
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why is because we have no distance to evaluate the potential health risks of that technology.

794
01:19:39,798 --> 01:19:51,101
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to add on to what Consular Marks said and quotes the International EMF Scientist Appeal, which was signed by hundreds of scientists in 2007.

795
01:19:52,001 --> 01:19:56,923
[SPEAKER_14]: I should say scientists without any ties to the industry or conflicts of interest, because I think that matters.

796
01:19:58,063 --> 01:20:05,185
[SPEAKER_14]: They are very concerned about the health effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic fields.

797
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:23,978
[SPEAKER_14]: And based on more than over 2000 peer-reviewed research papers and letters, they state that, you know, numerous recent scientific publications have showed that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines.

798
01:20:24,858 --> 01:20:41,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans.

799
01:20:42,142 --> 01:20:47,603
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to mention that regarding the FCC current exposure limits,

800
01:20:48,523 --> 01:20:49,984
[SPEAKER_14]: They are, as we said, outdated.

801
01:20:50,004 --> 01:20:54,745
[SPEAKER_14]: They are 100 times higher than those of many countries in Europe.

802
01:20:56,045 --> 01:21:01,186
[SPEAKER_14]: They are only designated to protect us from short-term heating risks due to RAF exposure.

803
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:13,890
[SPEAKER_14]: The FCC also has Lombardian lawsuits against it for not accounting for biological effects.

804
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:16,593
[SPEAKER_14]: in the setting of their standards.

805
01:21:16,933 --> 01:21:30,613
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to quote, if I have time, the final report of the commission to study the environmental and health effects of evolving 5G technology from the state of New Hampshire of General Courts in Concord

806
01:21:32,295 --> 01:21:48,526
[SPEAKER_14]: They state in their first recommendation that the majority of the commission believes that the FCC has not exercised due diligence in its mission to manage the electromagnetic environment by not setting exposure limits that protect against health effects.

807
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:56,571
[SPEAKER_14]: They have failed to support technical means and investigations aimed at reducing human exposures to EMR.

808
01:21:58,432 --> 01:21:59,754
[SPEAKER_14]: electromagnetic radiation.

809
01:22:00,655 --> 01:22:03,979
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to urge everyone to do their research.

810
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:06,462
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all publicly accessible.

811
01:22:07,623 --> 01:22:16,174
[SPEAKER_14]: All over the world, people are asking for time to study the health effects of such a new technology.

812
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:30,612
[SPEAKER_14]: not aware, but there were strong assumptions from scientists that this is extremely risky, as was said for pregnant women, for babies, for children, but also for all of us.

813
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,714
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think everyone has to make an informed decision on that.

814
01:22:35,054 --> 01:22:35,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

815
01:22:35,835 --> 01:22:36,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

816
01:22:36,956 --> 01:22:40,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, and Delphine, could you provide your address for the record?

817
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:40,858
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

818
01:22:41,178 --> 01:22:42,859
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 10 Brookings Street.

819
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

820
01:22:46,362 --> 01:22:46,802
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, next.

821
01:22:49,133 --> 01:22:51,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Next on the list is Peter Jones.

822
01:22:53,298 --> 01:22:53,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Peter.

823
01:22:57,604 --> 01:22:57,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

824
01:22:57,884 --> 01:22:59,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting some feedback.

825
01:22:59,886 --> 01:23:01,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to move away.

826
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:02,570
[SPEAKER_05]: One second.

827
01:23:04,352 --> 01:23:04,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

828
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:06,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to ask.

829
01:23:09,096 --> 01:23:34,213
[SPEAKER_05]: If Dr. Swanson has any conflicts, if he's paid either by Verizon or by any industry organization for his representation, I also want to ask why he only talks about thermal and ionizing effects of radiation and doesn't speak about any of the other effects, non-ionizing effects, as well as the effects that Delphine Picard just mentioned.

830
01:23:35,393 --> 01:23:38,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, my name is Peter Jones, and I live at 10 Brookings Street in Medford.

831
01:23:38,834 --> 01:23:41,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you, Peter.

832
01:23:42,275 --> 01:23:46,037
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to see if we can have Mr. Swanson address those two questions.

833
01:23:48,037 --> 01:23:49,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm happy to.

834
01:23:49,898 --> 01:24:01,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been working in this area for about 10 years advocating for public knowledge about the real risks associated with this stuff, not imagined risks.

835
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:09,144
[SPEAKER_08]: However, for the last year and a half or so, I've been employed by CTIA to help spread that message.

836
01:24:09,525 --> 01:24:14,790
[SPEAKER_08]: And for this particular meeting, I am being reimbursed for my time by CTIA.

837
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:16,571
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a trade organization.

838
01:24:18,073 --> 01:24:26,341
[SPEAKER_08]: As for the non-thermal effects of this radiation, the reason I don't talk about that is because they are not proven to exist.

839
01:24:27,857 --> 01:24:36,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So there have been a long list, laundry lists of things that this radiation is reputed to cause in people.

840
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:47,261
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me explain why that exists, why people think this, and why you can find almost anything said on the internet about safety.

841
01:24:48,181 --> 01:24:55,343
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been something like 25,000 studies made on the health effects of radiation on people and animals.

842
01:24:56,622 --> 01:24:58,923
[SPEAKER_08]: The false positive rate in those studies is about 5%.

843
01:24:59,623 --> 01:25:00,923
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an industry standard.

844
01:25:01,363 --> 01:25:06,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And what that means is that there exists about 1,000 studies that find something.

845
01:25:06,924 --> 01:25:07,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, they're random.

846
01:25:08,085 --> 01:25:09,105
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a false positive.

847
01:25:09,145 --> 01:25:09,665
[SPEAKER_08]: It's random.

848
01:25:10,045 --> 01:25:13,046
[SPEAKER_08]: And that means it's everything, everything you could list.

849
01:25:13,206 --> 01:25:16,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And we heard already long lists of things that could be caused.

850
01:25:17,467 --> 01:25:23,228
[SPEAKER_08]: When you focus on the 5%, you are ignoring the 95%.

851
01:25:24,729 --> 01:25:26,329
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, that's why I'm here.

852
01:25:26,794 --> 01:25:32,661
[SPEAKER_08]: because I find it frustrating when people ignore 95% of what is being told them.

853
01:25:35,645 --> 01:25:35,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

854
01:25:38,087 --> 01:25:39,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, we'll go to the next person.

855
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:40,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

856
01:25:43,053 --> 01:25:44,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Erin Brandes.

857
01:25:49,757 --> 01:25:51,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Aaron Brandes.

858
01:25:52,138 --> 01:26:02,280
[SPEAKER_02]: And this June I will have lived in Medford for 30 years, all of it on Wareham Street and Marion Street in South Medford.

859
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:08,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a couple of groups of questions.

860
01:26:08,981 --> 01:26:11,502
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is... What's your current address?

861
01:26:12,562 --> 01:26:14,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 48 Marion Street.

862
01:26:14,422 --> 01:26:15,222
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

863
01:26:15,522 --> 01:26:16,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford, Massachusetts.

864
01:26:17,243 --> 01:26:17,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

865
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:28,253
[SPEAKER_02]: So from what I understand that these are, okay, these are short range signals.

866
01:26:28,653 --> 01:26:34,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, will these signals benefit only people who use Verizon?

867
01:26:35,875 --> 01:26:40,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Coincidentally, there seem to be teams of Verizon salespeople.

868
01:26:41,077 --> 01:26:42,998
[SPEAKER_02]: in my neighborhood like yesterday?

869
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:46,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what if you use T-Mobile?

870
01:26:46,961 --> 01:26:49,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this just not of any help to you?

871
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:53,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the town, what happens if AT&T comes?

872
01:26:54,366 --> 01:26:56,007
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to put up towers.

873
01:26:57,507 --> 01:26:58,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, equipment.

874
01:26:59,349 --> 01:27:00,589
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and

875
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:11,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Verizon willing to give Medford some shareable equipment or equipment for town use to monitor possible effects?

876
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:16,285
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's my first question or set of questions.

877
01:27:16,545 --> 01:27:19,228
[SPEAKER_02]: My second question is a design question.

878
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:26,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Verizon consider using fewer but higher poles?

879
01:27:26,673 --> 01:27:31,175
[SPEAKER_02]: My understanding is that that could be an alternative.

880
01:27:31,575 --> 01:27:42,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I also saw in the documents for the city of Denver, they required the use of radio frequency transparent shrouds.

881
01:27:43,461 --> 01:27:50,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering why it didn't, when you said that shrouding will not work, or have you

882
01:27:50,804 --> 01:27:55,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you unwilling to consider the expense of radio frequency shrouding?

883
01:27:55,406 --> 01:28:07,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I'm wondering why this plan includes no spots in Lawrence Estates or West Medford, where the property values are generally higher.

884
01:28:08,013 --> 01:28:11,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this because you think there will be more resistance?

885
01:28:13,736 --> 01:28:14,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally,

886
01:28:16,571 --> 01:28:23,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering how the committee is going to consider the individual cases.

887
01:28:23,877 --> 01:28:40,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it strictly a question of how close people are to towers, or will you be affected if someone says they have a lawyer who has some way in which they're going to contest it?

888
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:44,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I know that those are a bunch of questions, but I think that,

889
01:28:47,135 --> 01:28:48,436
[SPEAKER_02]: we deserve answers.

890
01:28:48,816 --> 01:28:49,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

891
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:50,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

892
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:59,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say that the committee has to go by the policy that's set forth for us by the mayor's administration.

893
01:29:00,122 --> 01:29:04,744
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're operating under the policy as written.

894
01:29:05,885 --> 01:29:08,906
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not sure if that helps answer the second part of your question.

895
01:29:10,607 --> 01:29:11,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And then as far as the,

896
01:29:13,355 --> 01:29:18,716
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also interested in the locations and I believe Verizon indicated it was coverage.

897
01:29:20,056 --> 01:29:26,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there someone in Verizon who wants to talk about why the neighborhoods that are selected are selected?

898
01:29:26,538 --> 01:29:36,880
[SPEAKER_38]: I can go ahead and speak to that.

899
01:29:37,863 --> 01:29:40,225
[SPEAKER_38]: This is 44 applications that we filed.

900
01:29:40,485 --> 01:29:44,508
[SPEAKER_38]: As Stan Yusevich mentioned earlier, the goal is to eventually cover all of Medford.

901
01:29:44,928 --> 01:29:47,930
[SPEAKER_38]: This just happens to be the first 44 applications that we filed.

902
01:29:51,113 --> 01:29:55,816
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically, Verizon expects to file more?

903
01:29:58,138 --> 01:30:00,960
[SPEAKER_38]: We would expect to be able to cover the entire city of Medford.

904
01:30:04,062 --> 01:30:05,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, let's go on to the next person, please.

905
01:30:08,475 --> 01:30:11,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Luke Prezner.

906
01:30:12,676 --> 01:30:12,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Luke.

907
01:30:13,036 --> 01:30:13,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address, please.

908
01:30:18,718 --> 01:30:19,318
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't hear you.

909
01:30:23,739 --> 01:30:26,140
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll give him 20 seconds to... Hi there.

910
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:28,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

911
01:30:29,421 --> 01:30:32,402
[SPEAKER_31]: Luke Prezner, 140 Forest Street.

912
01:30:33,882 --> 01:30:37,403
[SPEAKER_31]: I guess I only have one question and I'll get to it at the end.

913
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:40,207
[SPEAKER_31]: But I'm not going to take up the whole two minutes.

914
01:30:41,727 --> 01:30:48,109
[SPEAKER_31]: So I've actually really enjoyed the public discussion over RF and spectrum physics, thermal absorption.

915
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:53,991
[SPEAKER_31]: I thought I heard something about shrouds not being possible, and I think that's easily called into question.

916
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:58,073
[SPEAKER_31]: While everybody was talking, I read an article in the Microwave Journal.

917
01:30:59,033 --> 01:31:04,435
[SPEAKER_31]: It's pretty recent, and New York City is enforcing shrouds.

918
01:31:06,397 --> 01:31:11,799
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, there was a nice article in the Microwave Journal about RF transparent shrouds that are being deployed in New York City.

919
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:14,740
[SPEAKER_31]: There's numerous examples, just Google it.

920
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:24,164
[SPEAKER_31]: Professionally, I work with radars, and I'm familiar with, in our case, Astrofort's composite antenna shrouds for microwave radars.

921
01:31:24,404 --> 01:31:31,826
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, people have seen an AWACS, but the radar is actually inside the rotor dome, so it's going through a composite material.

922
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:33,267
[SPEAKER_31]: But anyway, that's not my question.

923
01:31:34,827 --> 01:31:36,368
[SPEAKER_31]: I want to know about trees and roads.

924
01:31:36,968 --> 01:31:43,612
[SPEAKER_31]: So Medford has well over 50 miles of roads, and these are going up on posts.

925
01:31:44,592 --> 01:31:49,535
[SPEAKER_31]: So if the line of sight's about 1,000 feet, how many towers are we talking about?

926
01:31:49,555 --> 01:31:49,535
500?

927
01:31:49,855 --> 01:31:51,576
[SPEAKER_31]: Is it 1,000?

928
01:31:52,216 --> 01:31:55,638
[SPEAKER_31]: And then, actually, that's not my question.

929
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:56,779
[SPEAKER_31]: That is the answer.

930
01:31:56,799 --> 01:31:58,319
[SPEAKER_31]: It's somewhere around 500, maybe 1,000.

931
01:31:58,359 --> 01:31:59,340
[SPEAKER_31]: Here's the question.

932
01:32:01,554 --> 01:32:25,228
[SPEAKER_31]: Has Verizon offered tree plantings as a kind of an aesthetic offset to the introduction of these possibly unsightly units, especially if they're untrouted, as well as an offset to all the, and this is my personal fear, autonomous vehicle traffic that will come once we're in the 5G infrastructure of the future.

933
01:32:25,848 --> 01:32:27,209
[SPEAKER_31]: So it's about tree plantings.

934
01:32:27,389 --> 01:32:31,171
[SPEAKER_31]: Has Verizon offered tree plantings and communities as an offset

935
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:34,891
[SPEAKER_31]: for introducing this technology to our neighborhoods.

936
01:32:35,371 --> 01:32:35,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

937
01:32:36,472 --> 01:32:36,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Luke.

938
01:32:36,952 --> 01:32:37,992
[SPEAKER_11]: And you were right on time.

939
01:32:38,232 --> 01:32:40,453
[SPEAKER_11]: So the two minutes, so good work.

940
01:32:41,853 --> 01:32:48,435
[SPEAKER_11]: The answer to your question is no, they have not offered any tree plantings and we have not requested any as a city.

941
01:32:49,556 --> 01:32:50,096
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the answer.

942
01:32:50,116 --> 01:32:52,477
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Amanda, we'll go to the next one.

943
01:32:54,557 --> 01:32:57,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Dennis Dedling-Kalhofer.

944
01:33:00,934 --> 01:33:07,498
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I could ask folks, if you've had a chance to speak, if you could take your hand down, your virtual hand down, that would be helpful.

945
01:33:08,699 --> 01:33:09,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure we get to everybody.

946
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:10,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

947
01:33:12,522 --> 01:33:12,742
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

948
01:33:13,232 --> 01:33:16,153
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, hi, so my name is Dennis.

949
01:33:16,213 --> 01:33:23,415
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, Dennis Detling, Karl Tofer, and I live at 120 North Street in Medford.

950
01:33:24,395 --> 01:33:31,737
[SPEAKER_23]: They're actually, one of the sites is going to be behind my house on the next street up.

951
01:33:33,258 --> 01:33:36,179
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to mention, there's been a lot of studies

952
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:43,582
[SPEAKER_23]: that have shown, like the others have mentioned, adverse health effects of wireless technology.

953
01:33:46,424 --> 01:33:51,207
[SPEAKER_23]: The FCC has not done any testing on the long-term effects of 5G.

954
01:33:52,287 --> 01:33:56,730
[SPEAKER_23]: Like other people said, it's based on the 4G technology.

955
01:33:57,171 --> 01:34:03,235
[SPEAKER_23]: And even the 4G technology has been shown to have health effects.

956
01:34:03,395 --> 01:34:15,144
[SPEAKER_23]: Even the American Cancer Society said that there have been some cases of brain cancer for people that use cell phones a lot, for example.

957
01:34:15,944 --> 01:34:25,207
[SPEAKER_23]: and that everyone's overall exposure to wireless frequencies will go up with 5G.

958
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:31,450
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, I don't know if anyone wants to get into the

959
01:34:32,484 --> 01:34:36,347
[SPEAKER_23]: technology about how cells are affected, but they are affected.

960
01:34:36,367 --> 01:34:57,625
[SPEAKER_23]: They've even been shown that cell phones break down the blood-brain barrier and that the city, I wanna mention this study that was, someone mentioned already, but not study, yes, study and a report from the state of New Hampshire.

961
01:34:57,665 --> 01:34:59,006
[SPEAKER_23]: They made some recommendations.

962
01:34:59,767 --> 01:35:00,988
[SPEAKER_23]: And there are 15 all together.

963
01:35:01,008 --> 01:35:02,049
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not going to read them all.

964
01:35:02,109 --> 01:35:13,956
[SPEAKER_23]: But one of them is that we should migrate schools and libraries from wireless to wire technologies, even with the 4G wireless.

965
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:22,541
[SPEAKER_23]: They wanted the state of New Hampshire, and we could do this in the city, is to collect signal strength measurements and establish protocols for these measurements.

966
01:35:23,802 --> 01:35:30,724
[SPEAKER_23]: and require the wireless antennas to be set back from residences, businesses, and schools.

967
01:35:30,784 --> 01:35:32,865
[SPEAKER_23]: And Councilor Marks mentioned that as well.

968
01:35:34,065 --> 01:35:45,768
[SPEAKER_23]: They also encourage individuals to migrate from wireless to wire technologies.

969
01:35:46,148 --> 01:35:47,549
[SPEAKER_23]: All it requires is a cable.

970
01:35:48,429 --> 01:35:49,489
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all I wanted to say.

971
01:35:49,609 --> 01:35:50,850
[SPEAKER_23]: And do an impact study.

972
01:35:52,170 --> 01:35:52,410
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

973
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:54,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, next.

974
01:35:54,711 --> 01:35:58,473
[SPEAKER_17]: I have Larry, just Larry.

975
01:35:59,934 --> 01:36:01,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Larry, name and address for the record, please.

976
01:36:11,062 --> 01:36:11,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Larry, are you with us?

977
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:13,804
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

978
01:36:13,984 --> 01:36:14,344
[SPEAKER_36]: Hello.

979
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:15,265
[SPEAKER_36]: Can you hear me?

980
01:36:16,225 --> 01:36:16,846
[SPEAKER_36]: We can.

981
01:36:17,086 --> 01:36:21,049
[SPEAKER_36]: Larry Chucky, 118 Ashcroft Road, Medford, Mass.

982
01:36:23,545 --> 01:36:26,187
[SPEAKER_36]: And I have a couple of comments.

983
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:33,091
[SPEAKER_36]: At first, I am against putting the 5G because of the health reasons.

984
01:36:34,392 --> 01:36:39,515
[SPEAKER_36]: And there was an article I read in Scientific American.

985
01:36:41,016 --> 01:36:42,196
[SPEAKER_36]: I can give you the name.

986
01:36:42,897 --> 01:36:46,899
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll give you the second article first by John Rappaport on the blog.

987
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,401
[SPEAKER_36]: That one was 5G and the China epidemic.

988
01:36:51,965 --> 01:36:54,708
[SPEAKER_36]: That one said, there's one very serious claim.

989
01:36:55,388 --> 01:37:10,584
[SPEAKER_36]: When 5G employs a frequency at 60 Hertz, there's a disruption in oxygen molecules occurs and the crucial hemoglobin to pick up oxygen and transport it throughout the body is impaired.

990
01:37:12,225 --> 01:37:13,967
[SPEAKER_36]: And the other thing it said in there,

991
01:37:15,325 --> 01:37:22,908
[SPEAKER_36]: Despite widespread denial, the evidence that radio frequency radiation is harmful to life is already overwhelming.

992
01:37:23,909 --> 01:37:34,253
[SPEAKER_36]: The accumulating clinical evidence of sick and injured human beings, experiments or evidence of damage to DNA, cells and organ systems.

993
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:36,214
[SPEAKER_36]: I think we heard that one before.

994
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:41,396
[SPEAKER_36]: The first article, the article

995
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:45,803
[SPEAKER_36]: by Scientific American warns 5G is unsafe.

996
01:37:45,943 --> 01:37:51,447
[SPEAKER_36]: That's November 14th, 2019 by Joe McCullough.

997
01:37:52,448 --> 01:38:03,898
[SPEAKER_36]: And a couple of things in there is they made the point that if we need increased internet speed, why don't we use fiber optic connections?

998
01:38:03,918 --> 01:38:06,800
[SPEAKER_36]: Because that would be far better and safer.

999
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:07,901
[SPEAKER_36]: That is my question.

1000
01:38:08,401 --> 01:38:09,102
[SPEAKER_36]: Why don't they use

1001
01:38:09,854 --> 01:38:19,299
[SPEAKER_36]: fiber optic connections instead of wireless, because the 5G has the microwave radiation exposures, which we mentioned.

1002
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Larry.

1003
01:38:22,241 --> 01:38:23,841
[SPEAKER_11]: That's time.

1004
01:38:23,861 --> 01:38:32,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I do believe that the market demand is wireless, which is, I believe, why the industry is heading in that direction.

1005
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:36,188
[SPEAKER_11]: And Verizon can correct me if I'm wrong, but based off your presentation and from what I know.

1006
01:38:39,979 --> 01:38:41,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, Amanda, we'll go to the next person.

1007
01:38:44,763 --> 01:38:46,744
[SPEAKER_17]: I have here Alyssa's iPhone.

1008
01:38:47,985 --> 01:38:51,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me see if I can find you in here.

1009
01:38:56,171 --> 01:38:58,133
[SPEAKER_11]: So many people with the last name iPhone these days.

1010
01:38:58,273 --> 01:39:01,075
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a joke, folks.

1011
01:39:04,457 --> 01:39:04,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Did we find her?

1012
01:39:06,166 --> 01:39:07,647
[SPEAKER_17]: actually, I'm not seeing them.

1013
01:39:08,147 --> 01:39:10,149
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll move to the next person if they come back.

1014
01:39:10,389 --> 01:39:12,510
[SPEAKER_11]: There's plenty of hands.

1015
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:13,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

1016
01:39:13,671 --> 01:39:14,351
[SPEAKER_17]: So Brad.

1017
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:17,393
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello, Brad.

1018
01:39:19,295 --> 01:39:20,896
[SPEAKER_28]: Unmute.

1019
01:39:20,916 --> 01:39:21,856
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, my name is Brad.

1020
01:39:22,176 --> 01:39:24,758
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm 49 Dearborn Street in Medford.

1021
01:39:26,579 --> 01:39:28,601
[SPEAKER_28]: I have concerns about the 5G.

1022
01:39:31,593 --> 01:39:37,656
[SPEAKER_28]: My question to our resident scientist, Dr. Swanson, I believe.

1023
01:39:39,757 --> 01:39:42,838
[SPEAKER_28]: He said that he was not fringe.

1024
01:39:43,598 --> 01:39:57,444
[SPEAKER_28]: Just want to point out that a lot of the signatories to the call for a moratorium on 5G are mainstream scientists, MDs and scientists.

1025
01:39:57,624 --> 01:39:58,625
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd like to comment on that.

1026
01:39:59,652 --> 01:40:06,371
[SPEAKER_28]: I also want to point out that the European Parliament has asked for a

1027
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:10,134
[SPEAKER_28]: a prudential slowdown.

1028
01:40:10,734 --> 01:40:13,416
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me read you something from the European Parliament statement.

1029
01:40:13,436 --> 01:40:16,037
[SPEAKER_28]: It's called effects of 5G wireless on human health, March, 2020.

1030
01:40:16,357 --> 01:40:23,541
[SPEAKER_28]: The review concludes that evidence of the biological properties of radio frequency EMF are accumulating progressively.

1031
01:40:23,561 --> 01:40:32,586
[SPEAKER_28]: And even though they are in some cases still preliminary or controversial point to the existence of multi-level interactions between EMF and biological systems.

1032
01:40:33,166 --> 01:40:34,547
[SPEAKER_28]: So you can find that yourself.

1033
01:40:35,441 --> 01:40:44,366
[SPEAKER_28]: So there are a lot of countries and municipalities in Europe and in the United States, they're asking for prudence, caution, slow down, more research.

1034
01:40:45,306 --> 01:40:52,830
[SPEAKER_28]: The WHO says that in 2022, they'll have a review of human health and EMF, including 5G.

1035
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:54,991
[SPEAKER_28]: Why are we in such a hurry?

1036
01:40:55,511 --> 01:41:04,976
[SPEAKER_28]: Why can't we slow down, do this right, make sure that the technology is absolutely safe for humans and all living things?

1037
01:41:05,418 --> 01:41:06,561
[SPEAKER_28]: That's my comment.

1038
01:41:06,621 --> 01:41:09,549
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope that Dr. Swanson can answer the question.

1039
01:41:09,569 --> 01:41:11,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Brad.

1040
01:41:11,494 --> 01:41:13,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, could you just repeat the question real quick?

1041
01:41:14,929 --> 01:41:19,110
[SPEAKER_28]: The question is that Dr. Swanson said that he was not fringe.

1042
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:35,234
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm saying that there are a lot of mainstream MDs and scientists who have signed a moratorium request, and there are very legitimate public health experts writing in places like Scientific American who are not fringe.

1043
01:41:35,774 --> 01:41:40,875
[SPEAKER_28]: So what is the answer to the fact that we have mainstream MDs and scientists who are

1044
01:41:41,916 --> 01:41:48,283
[SPEAKER_28]: who are asking for prudence, slow down, moratorium, more research, don't rush the technology.

1045
01:41:49,064 --> 01:41:49,244
[SPEAKER_28]: Yep.

1046
01:41:49,524 --> 01:41:49,744
[SPEAKER_28]: Got it.

1047
01:41:49,965 --> 01:41:50,165
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1048
01:41:50,365 --> 01:41:52,487
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, Brad, sorry, Tim.

1049
01:41:52,928 --> 01:41:55,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Could you just share your last name for the record?

1050
01:41:55,571 --> 01:41:58,774
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, it's, uh, Clompus, C-L-O-M-P-U-S.

1051
01:42:00,876 --> 01:42:02,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your, um, thoroughness.

1052
01:42:02,518 --> 01:42:04,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I much appreciate it from my end.

1053
01:42:05,565 --> 01:42:09,466
[SPEAKER_11]: So Dr. Swanson, I asked him to repeat the question just so we all heard it again.

1054
01:42:09,486 --> 01:42:19,428
[SPEAKER_11]: He's asking you to comment on the fact that the 250 scientists that have been referred to a couple of times now are not fringe, they are mainstream as well.

1055
01:42:19,929 --> 01:42:23,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you, Mr. Kampos for the opportunity to clarify.

1056
01:42:23,969 --> 01:42:30,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I should say that what I mean by fringe is not that they live in a trash bin or something like that.

1057
01:42:30,671 --> 01:42:33,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean that their opinion is in the minority.

1058
01:42:36,028 --> 01:42:37,909
[SPEAKER_08]: You're referring to the 5G appeal.

1059
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:45,555
[SPEAKER_08]: That appeal is being signed by about 260 doctors and scientists in Europe and North America.

1060
01:42:47,457 --> 01:42:48,337
[SPEAKER_08]: You can Google this.

1061
01:42:48,497 --> 01:42:54,322
[SPEAKER_08]: There are about 6 million scientists and doctors in Europe and North America.

1062
01:42:54,982 --> 01:43:02,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that they could only come up with 260 signatures is the definition of fringe.

1063
01:43:05,969 --> 01:43:06,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, next person.

1064
01:43:11,831 --> 01:43:12,771
[SPEAKER_17]: Marvin Vinay.

1065
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:15,332
[SPEAKER_30]: Hello, Marvin.

1066
01:43:16,492 --> 01:43:16,892
[SPEAKER_30]: Good evening.

1067
01:43:19,012 --> 01:43:20,273
[SPEAKER_30]: My name is Marvin Vinay.

1068
01:43:20,333 --> 01:43:34,076
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm the director of advocacy for Tech Goes Home, and I am not a resident of Medford, but I'd love to give an excerpt of the testimony that has been submitted to the small cell committee members by email, if that's okay.

1069
01:43:36,683 --> 01:43:42,286
[SPEAKER_30]: Dear Small Cell Committee members, we at Tech Goes Home are an organization that fights for digital equity daily.

1070
01:43:42,826 --> 01:43:47,027
[SPEAKER_30]: We empower communities to use digital tools to overcome barriers and improve lives.

1071
01:43:47,547 --> 01:43:53,670
[SPEAKER_30]: To that end, we supply computers, either a new Chromebook or iPad, internet, and 15 hours of digital literacy.

1072
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:59,932
[SPEAKER_30]: In practice, we meet a trifecta, students with remote learning, parents with job security, and seniors with telehealth.

1073
01:44:01,684 --> 01:44:06,448
[SPEAKER_30]: Digital access and inclusion are paramount for our learners and to have digitally fit lives.

1074
01:44:07,288 --> 01:44:14,033
[SPEAKER_30]: Thus, we've come before this committee to support the approval of Verizon's proposal to install its small cell network throughout Medford.

1075
01:44:14,914 --> 01:44:19,378
[SPEAKER_30]: 5G internet services will improve access and coverage for the Medford residents.

1076
01:44:20,358 --> 01:44:25,002
[SPEAKER_30]: Connectivity is invaluable today in today's digital world of business learning.

1077
01:44:25,630 --> 01:44:33,553
[SPEAKER_30]: And as we know, 16 million public school students across the United States lack access to either an internet connection or device for learning at home.

1078
01:44:34,293 --> 01:44:41,775
[SPEAKER_30]: Without reliable internet access, digital inequity will plague residents in the education, telehealth, and workforce development space for years to come.

1079
01:44:42,956 --> 01:44:49,638
[SPEAKER_30]: We are pleased to hear that Verizon plans to expand its service area for 5G sales throughout the entire city of Medford.

1080
01:44:50,359 --> 01:44:56,963
[SPEAKER_30]: and TGAC has expanded its efforts with families who live and work in Medford and who can truly benefit from this greater access.

1081
01:44:57,604 --> 01:45:05,889
[SPEAKER_30]: Last year in the pandemic, we offered four courses in Medford in collaboration with community partners, Best Health Hospitality, and we educated 61 learners.

1082
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:18,778
[SPEAKER_30]: We believe the greater access will afford high quality internet access, will bring much needed resources to the family residents of Medford that we serve, and we're excited that Verizon is looking to expand its footprint in the entire Medford community.

1083
01:45:19,222 --> 01:45:22,844
[SPEAKER_30]: I hope that you, the small cell committee, will approve this application to begin.

1084
01:45:23,445 --> 01:45:28,148
[SPEAKER_30]: If you have further questions, please contact me at Marvin at techgoeshome.org.

1085
01:45:28,168 --> 01:45:29,309
[SPEAKER_30]: And I thank you for this time.

1086
01:45:40,977 --> 01:45:44,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Next on our list is George Silvestro.

1087
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:52,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

1088
01:45:52,210 --> 01:45:56,351
[SPEAKER_17]: We can hear you.

1089
01:45:56,871 --> 01:45:57,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1090
01:45:57,292 --> 01:45:57,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I was on mute.

1091
01:45:57,952 --> 01:45:58,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1092
01:45:59,392 --> 01:46:00,973
[SPEAKER_11]: I said next.

1093
01:46:01,093 --> 01:46:02,613
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, hello, George.

1094
01:46:02,673 --> 01:46:03,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record.

1095
01:46:03,653 --> 01:46:04,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize.

1096
01:46:04,534 --> 01:46:06,914
[SPEAKER_22]: George Silvestro, 45 Brogan Road.

1097
01:46:08,275 --> 01:46:09,355
[SPEAKER_22]: I was born in Medford.

1098
01:46:10,235 --> 01:46:11,235
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm 64 years old.

1099
01:46:13,156 --> 01:46:14,436
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have some concern.

1100
01:46:14,476 --> 01:46:17,797
[SPEAKER_22]: I have five letters, notifications from five different properties.

1101
01:46:21,285 --> 01:46:29,890
[SPEAKER_22]: The one at 45 Brogan Road I live in, the telephone pole is only 12 feet from my house.

1102
01:46:31,491 --> 01:46:35,373
[SPEAKER_22]: My house is eight feet from the side, 10 feet from the sidewalk.

1103
01:46:36,394 --> 01:46:47,500
[SPEAKER_22]: The pole itself is two feet from my property line, which is not accessible for baby carriages to go by.

1104
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,362
[SPEAKER_22]: It's in front of my living room.

1105
01:46:51,672 --> 01:46:54,172
[SPEAKER_22]: And my house is one and a half stories.

1106
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:58,573
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you asked about the 20 to 30 feet.

1107
01:46:59,453 --> 01:47:03,154
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, this is 12 feet.

1108
01:47:04,614 --> 01:47:12,496
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's a park across the street, a playground, a ball field that's only, you know, the street went to the street wide.

1109
01:47:12,516 --> 01:47:21,037
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't understand, I'm the only house on this side from Court Street to Park Street

1110
01:47:21,687 --> 01:47:34,138
[SPEAKER_22]: and they had to pick the pole in front of my house that I live in, not to mention the three houses, the three families that I have in South Meffitt, that the poles are in front of those.

1111
01:47:35,319 --> 01:47:39,102
[SPEAKER_22]: And South Meffitt's a tight neighborhood and the poles are close there.

1112
01:47:39,122 --> 01:47:40,023
[SPEAKER_22]: That's my concern.

1113
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:42,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1114
01:47:42,531 --> 01:47:53,241
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to get the measurements clear that was measured 45 broken road application 27, which will get into specifically single story dwelling is only about 12 feet away.

1115
01:47:53,842 --> 01:47:54,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and it's pole 6734.

1116
01:47:57,442 --> 01:47:59,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, okay, so yeah, I know the pole you're talking about.

1117
01:47:59,443 --> 01:48:00,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember this one, yep.

1118
01:48:00,843 --> 01:48:04,644
[SPEAKER_11]: And other drawings in the area are approximately 95 plus feet away.

1119
01:48:05,365 --> 01:48:07,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Yours would be the closest one basically right in front of your house.

1120
01:48:08,306 --> 01:48:08,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1121
01:48:09,106 --> 01:48:10,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, it is on the top of the pole.

1122
01:48:11,086 --> 01:48:16,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so everybody understands, like all the other ones, it's at the top of the pole, not in the plane of your house.

1123
01:48:16,288 --> 01:48:22,670
[SPEAKER_11]: But regardless, the horizontal, between the pole and your house is about 12 feet, so I acknowledge that.

1124
01:48:22,810 --> 01:48:24,771
[SPEAKER_22]: And my picture window looks at the pole.

1125
01:48:25,465 --> 01:48:28,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, I'm acknowledging that.

1126
01:48:28,327 --> 01:48:32,550
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the clearance was okay, but I'll double check as far as the horizontal clearance.

1127
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:33,730
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't get up.

1128
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:39,174
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I heard them talk about getting a carriage down the street.

1129
01:48:39,634 --> 01:48:41,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we could talk more.

1130
01:48:41,995 --> 01:48:43,016
[SPEAKER_11]: It's three feet.

1131
01:48:43,036 --> 01:48:45,838
[SPEAKER_11]: You need three feet of sidewalk between the pole and the back sidewalk.

1132
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:47,699
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only 30 inches, sir.

1133
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:48,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1134
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:49,100
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1135
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:51,602
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there's only 30 inches, then we'll have to confirm that.

1136
01:48:53,373 --> 01:48:56,054
[SPEAKER_22]: And the pole, they did replace the pole.

1137
01:48:56,514 --> 01:49:02,416
[SPEAKER_22]: The pole was, I've been here, my family has been here forever because the streets named after them broke.

1138
01:49:03,377 --> 01:49:10,199
[SPEAKER_22]: And the pole was hit in lightning 20 years ago, and they just replaced it two years ago.

1139
01:49:10,219 --> 01:49:15,041
[SPEAKER_22]: It broke down, they replaced it prior to putting the LED lights.

1140
01:49:17,837 --> 01:49:32,145
[SPEAKER_22]: And since then has listed to the right, picking up the sidewalk three inches and has the sidewalk has now snapped, but it's still two inches above the regular sidewalk.

1141
01:49:34,326 --> 01:49:36,287
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no support on the left of the pole.

1142
01:49:38,028 --> 01:49:42,270
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we get, when we get to that pole, we can talk about it in more detail.

1143
01:49:42,730 --> 01:49:42,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1144
01:49:43,151 --> 01:49:43,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at it on the map.

1145
01:49:44,331 --> 01:49:44,691
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

1146
01:49:45,212 --> 01:49:45,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Next.

1147
01:49:50,973 --> 01:49:54,554
[SPEAKER_17]: The next in line is Jarrett Johnson.

1148
01:49:57,515 --> 01:49:58,055
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi Jarrett.

1149
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:01,237
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, hello.

1150
01:50:01,277 --> 01:50:02,677
[SPEAKER_32]: My name is Jarrett Johnson.

1151
01:50:02,757 --> 01:50:05,878
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm at 39 Douglas Road in Medford.

1152
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:11,580
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to thank the chair and the committee for entertaining all of us

1153
01:50:12,118 --> 01:50:27,227
[SPEAKER_32]: Tonight I wanted to echo, you know, Councilor Mark and everyone else that spoke regarding the, you know, possible health impacts and I echo their sentiment and I will not be able to so eloquently speak my concerns as well as they have.

1154
01:50:28,508 --> 01:50:34,412
[SPEAKER_32]: But do just want to say, you know, that it is a new technology and, you know, the Verizon spokesperson said that if

1155
01:50:36,493 --> 01:50:40,715
[SPEAKER_32]: you could measure, you know, if there was a measurement that was outside the limits that it would be addressed.

1156
01:50:40,795 --> 01:50:48,279
[SPEAKER_32]: But, you know, I have searched for commercially available equipment to try to measure, you know, cells.

1157
01:50:50,453 --> 01:50:51,574
[SPEAKER_32]: signals in that frequency.

1158
01:50:51,594 --> 01:50:59,218
[SPEAKER_32]: Now I've not been able to find anything that goes above six or eight gigahertz, which I think Verizon's 5G would operate well above that.

1159
01:50:59,739 --> 01:51:03,000
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're kind of being left in the dark in that aspect.

1160
01:51:04,561 --> 01:51:18,670
[SPEAKER_32]: And then, you know, if the committee does unfortunately end up approving these sites, I would just like to recommend that there be a condition of the approval that if the FCC does come to their senses

1161
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:35,878
[SPEAKER_32]: and removes the requirement that cities and states cannot reject sites based on their health impacts that the city would reserve the right to rescind the approval in the case that that requirement was removed.

1162
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:39,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1163
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:40,261
[SPEAKER_11]: That's prudent.

1164
01:51:42,262 --> 01:51:43,943
[SPEAKER_11]: And just so everybody knows, I've said this before,

1165
01:51:46,112 --> 01:51:52,257
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee is, in the city in general, is operating under federal law and federal order.

1166
01:51:53,698 --> 01:52:02,124
[SPEAKER_11]: So the applications in front of us, the committee needs to decide what's in the best interest of the city here.

1167
01:52:04,206 --> 01:52:11,732
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we can't materially prohibit these installations.

1168
01:52:11,792 --> 01:52:12,452
[SPEAKER_11]: It's federal law.

1169
01:52:13,073 --> 01:52:13,673
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't do it.

1170
01:52:16,912 --> 01:52:27,454
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a reason for denial that's set forth in the policy, that's one thing, but if it's not set forth in the policy, that's another thing.

1171
01:52:28,334 --> 01:52:33,135
[SPEAKER_11]: And the federal law is pretty dang clear on this matter.

1172
01:52:33,155 --> 01:52:35,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know it's been tested in court a bunch.

1173
01:52:36,415 --> 01:52:42,297
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to decide as a committee, and I'm speaking to the committee members here, what's in the best interest of the city here.

1174
01:52:42,897 --> 01:52:44,837
[SPEAKER_11]: So moving on, Amanda next, please.

1175
01:52:47,962 --> 01:52:48,882
[SPEAKER_17]: John Costas.

1176
01:52:50,923 --> 01:52:52,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, can you hear me all right?

1177
01:52:53,023 --> 01:52:53,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Sean.

1178
01:52:53,503 --> 01:52:53,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1179
01:52:53,844 --> 01:52:55,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record.

1180
01:52:55,584 --> 01:53:05,247
[SPEAKER_01]: John Costas, 25 Salem Street, past president of the Chamber of Commerce and in business in the television repair business for 40 years.

1181
01:53:06,307 --> 01:53:07,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you really have a double edged sword here?

1182
01:53:08,167 --> 01:53:10,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, where does this technology end?

1183
01:53:13,046 --> 01:53:22,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember back when I first learned the television business, you know, 35 years ago, they told us the history of television and how many people didn't want television to exist.

1184
01:53:23,635 --> 01:53:27,779
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, we don't want the transmission of first radio signals because it's going to hurt us.

1185
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:30,601
[SPEAKER_01]: TV was just as bad.

1186
01:53:30,841 --> 01:53:33,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was afraid of a TV because of the RF transmission.

1187
01:53:34,605 --> 01:53:39,529
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the cell phones came out from, you know, 3G, 4G, we heard the same story.

1188
01:53:41,006 --> 01:53:43,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Some scientists say yes, it's no problem.

1189
01:53:43,348 --> 01:53:44,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Some say there is a problem.

1190
01:53:44,668 --> 01:53:46,650
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is here we are in 2021.

1191
01:53:47,170 --> 01:53:52,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we need technology.

1192
01:53:52,173 --> 01:54:00,358
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to keep on going forward, especially now because of COVID, as several people pointed out, technology is at the highest level right now.

1193
01:54:01,039 --> 01:54:03,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows what's going to happen in the future.

1194
01:54:03,677 --> 01:54:12,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a feeling more people are going to be working from home where they're going to need this higher technology or from a remote location where there may not be a fiber network.

1195
01:54:13,742 --> 01:54:26,968
[SPEAKER_01]: So as one business in the square for 40 years that's in the RF communication business, I think it's a great idea that you should pursue it and allow it to happen.

1196
01:54:27,308 --> 01:54:27,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1197
01:54:28,529 --> 01:54:28,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, John.

1198
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:30,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, next.

1199
01:54:32,468 --> 01:54:33,589
[SPEAKER_17]: Joseph Nazaro.

1200
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:36,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi Joe, Joseph, sorry.

1201
01:54:39,833 --> 01:54:41,154
[SPEAKER_11]: You're on mute, name and address for the record.

1202
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:58,887
[SPEAKER_11]: And just a reminder to folks while Joseph is unmuting himself, if you've already spoken during this segment, please put your hand down, your virtual hand, thank you.

1203
01:55:00,327 --> 01:55:03,928
[SPEAKER_21]: It's Joseph Nazaro, 9698 Princeton Street, Medford.

1204
01:55:04,529 --> 01:55:12,332
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to start by saying that I got atrial afibrillation from holding my cell phone here in my work shirt pocket.

1205
01:55:13,352 --> 01:55:17,333
[SPEAKER_21]: I noticed in the cell phone, I don't know if you can see it, I guess you can't.

1206
01:55:18,274 --> 01:55:21,955
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a whole section about the dangers of radio frequency radiation.

1207
01:55:22,015 --> 01:55:29,238
[SPEAKER_21]: It says, don't hold the cell phone within five millimeters of your body and don't put it to your head for health reasons.

1208
01:55:29,968 --> 01:55:40,093
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that Verizon cannot get insured by any insurance company for damage to health because of radio frequency radiation.

1209
01:55:40,113 --> 01:55:41,894
[SPEAKER_21]: Lloyd's of London turned them down.

1210
01:55:41,914 --> 01:55:48,638
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'd like to make comments at the end, but I have three quick questions.

1211
01:55:49,538 --> 01:55:54,221
[SPEAKER_21]: First, what's the propagation range of these antennas?

1212
01:56:00,293 --> 01:56:01,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I ask a question?

1213
01:56:01,734 --> 01:56:05,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, ask your questions and then we can... All three at once?

1214
01:56:05,557 --> 01:56:07,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so it was... What's the backhaul?

1215
01:56:08,039 --> 01:56:09,761
[SPEAKER_21]: What method of backhaul is it?

1216
01:56:09,981 --> 01:56:14,545
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it wired backhaul or is it radio wave backhaul?

1217
01:56:16,216 --> 01:56:18,758
[SPEAKER_21]: And then where will the batteries be?

1218
01:56:18,838 --> 01:56:21,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Are they going to be mounted on the poles or are they going to be on the sidewalk?

1219
01:56:22,642 --> 01:56:24,463
[SPEAKER_21]: And will they infringe on the right of way?

1220
01:56:25,725 --> 01:56:26,685
[SPEAKER_21]: So those are my three questions.

1221
01:56:26,725 --> 01:56:30,689
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want me to make my comments now or can I hear the questions first, the answer?

1222
01:56:31,149 --> 01:56:35,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, time just about up, but I think those are good questions.

1223
01:56:35,974 --> 01:56:42,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think if, say that last one again, the last question you had.

1224
01:56:43,078 --> 01:56:43,738
[SPEAKER_11]: The batteries.

1225
01:56:44,198 --> 01:56:44,778
[SPEAKER_11]: The batteries, okay.

1226
01:56:44,818 --> 01:56:52,700
[SPEAKER_11]: So that one, I believe these are fed from a power source on the pole and there are no batteries associated with it.

1227
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:54,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like Verizon to confirm that.

1228
01:56:55,081 --> 01:56:59,641
[SPEAKER_11]: And then if someone from Verizon could address your first two questions as well, that'd be great.

1229
01:56:59,661 --> 01:57:04,623
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, Mike can answer the battery question.

1230
01:57:05,023 --> 01:57:06,643
[SPEAKER_38]: There's no battery backup on these.

1231
01:57:07,523 --> 01:57:11,524
[SPEAKER_38]: As you mentioned, it's wired, it's an electric meter at the site.

1232
01:57:12,765 --> 01:57:15,608
[SPEAKER_38]: As for the backhaul, it is wired backhaul.

1233
01:57:16,568 --> 01:57:20,411
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think Jason will be able to answer the first question.

1234
01:57:21,112 --> 01:57:23,374
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, as I said before, these sites are line of sight.

1235
01:57:23,414 --> 01:57:31,140
[SPEAKER_29]: They won't go any more than a quarter to a half a mile, depending on how many trees are in the way or how many other objects are in the way.

1236
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:35,183
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you.

1237
01:57:35,203 --> 01:57:38,165
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go on to the next person, Amanda, please.

1238
01:57:39,486 --> 01:57:41,128
[SPEAKER_17]: I have here Barbara Kendall.

1239
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:42,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Barbara.

1240
01:57:48,423 --> 01:57:49,003
[SPEAKER_43]: Can you hear me?

1241
01:57:49,824 --> 01:57:50,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Indeed.

1242
01:57:50,724 --> 01:57:51,045
[SPEAKER_43]: Okay.

1243
01:57:51,485 --> 01:57:55,067
[SPEAKER_43]: I live at 101 Sheridan Ave and the application is number 29.

1244
01:57:56,923 --> 01:57:59,865
[SPEAKER_43]: Now there's two poles there right now.

1245
01:58:00,485 --> 01:58:03,287
[SPEAKER_43]: They put in a new one and they backed it up against the old one.

1246
01:58:03,767 --> 01:58:12,452
[SPEAKER_43]: My biggest problem is that my bedrooms are on the second floor and I'm less than, I believe I'm less than 20 feet from that pole.

1247
01:58:13,132 --> 01:58:18,275
[SPEAKER_43]: So the two front bedrooms are used and they're in a direct line of sight to that telephone pole.

1248
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:24,564
[SPEAKER_43]: My other problem is that I don't know what the long-term health effects will be from five.

1249
01:58:24,845 --> 01:58:27,467
[SPEAKER_43]: No one seems to be able to provide us with that answer.

1250
01:58:28,648 --> 01:58:32,310
[SPEAKER_43]: And the other problem I have is that I like to use my front porch.

1251
01:58:32,731 --> 01:58:35,313
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'm less than 20 feet from that pole.

1252
01:58:35,493 --> 01:58:45,441
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'm not going to be able to use that front porch anymore because I'll be afraid of whatever microwaves are being emitted from the pole while I'm trying to sit there and enjoy my front porch.

1253
01:58:46,021 --> 01:58:57,408
[SPEAKER_43]: My other question is why can't the, the cell towers be covered and something that would protect me, rather than just loose, you know, uncovered on shrouded.

1254
01:58:57,828 --> 01:59:00,090
[SPEAKER_43]: Now the other thing is, I feel that.

1255
01:59:01,172 --> 01:59:15,455
[SPEAKER_43]: These cells should be in residential areas and not in residential areas they should be in industrial areas, not right in front of my house, I, this is going to take my property value down.

1256
01:59:15,756 --> 01:59:21,197
[SPEAKER_43]: If I go to sell my house and who wants to live under a cell tower, it's going to damage the property values and

1257
01:59:24,498 --> 01:59:26,819
[SPEAKER_43]: impact my ability to sell my house at a later date.

1258
01:59:27,019 --> 01:59:28,279
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm 77 years old.

1259
01:59:28,339 --> 01:59:35,422
[SPEAKER_43]: I have two replacement needs and I have some other health issues and my bedroom's on the second floor in a direct line of sight to this telephone pole.

1260
01:59:35,482 --> 01:59:36,762
[SPEAKER_43]: So those are my problems.

1261
01:59:37,302 --> 01:59:41,164
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm definitely opposed to the cell towers and especially the one in front of my house.

1262
01:59:42,524 --> 01:59:42,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1263
01:59:42,924 --> 01:59:45,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And the one in front of your house was application 29-101 Sheridan.

1264
01:59:45,305 --> 01:59:45,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And I measured

1265
01:59:50,843 --> 02:00:00,586
[SPEAKER_11]: 24 feet within two three story residential buildings, and 60 feet within two other three story residential buildings.

1266
02:00:01,306 --> 02:00:05,567
[SPEAKER_11]: One of those must be yours, the close one must be yours it sounds like.

1267
02:00:05,587 --> 02:00:09,629
[SPEAKER_43]: Right in front of my house and that's the one you said had 24 feet.

1268
02:00:09,949 --> 02:00:10,309
[SPEAKER_43]: That's not.

1269
02:00:11,672 --> 02:00:15,074
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, that's exactly impacts my house terribly.

1270
02:00:15,155 --> 02:00:21,359
[SPEAKER_43]: So I would like it put someplace down, you know, with a Budweiser brewing plant.

1271
02:00:21,659 --> 02:00:26,142
[SPEAKER_43]: That's an industrial area friend, you know, the you've got Wegmans and all of that.

1272
02:00:26,182 --> 02:00:30,405
[SPEAKER_43]: That's an industrial area as opposed to a residential area, which is what I have.

1273
02:00:30,425 --> 02:00:32,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you very much, Barbara.

1274
02:00:32,286 --> 02:00:34,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate the input.

1275
02:00:35,789 --> 02:00:37,410
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, man, we'll move on to the next person.

1276
02:00:40,752 --> 02:00:41,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Sarah O'Grady.

1277
02:00:42,893 --> 02:00:43,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Sarah.

1278
02:00:52,856 --> 02:00:58,638
[SPEAKER_11]: And while Sarah is getting herself ready, just a reminder, take the hands down if you spoke.

1279
02:00:58,718 --> 02:01:05,021
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, if you've heard similar comments to what you're going to make, maybe consider holding off.

1280
02:01:05,201 --> 02:01:06,501
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a matter of time.

1281
02:01:07,902 --> 02:01:08,982
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course, you're welcome to speak.

1282
02:01:09,979 --> 02:01:10,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Sarah, we got you?

1283
02:01:10,579 --> 02:01:14,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Looks like not.

1284
02:01:14,262 --> 02:01:15,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we'll move on to the next person.

1285
02:01:17,784 --> 02:01:19,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Micah Shalom Kesselman.

1286
02:01:20,505 --> 02:01:21,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Micah, we have you.

1287
02:01:28,770 --> 02:01:30,031
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're speaking, you're on mute.

1288
02:01:30,791 --> 02:01:33,473
[SPEAKER_11]: She's clapping or he or she.

1289
02:01:34,914 --> 02:01:36,535
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can unmute yourself,

1290
02:01:38,113 --> 02:01:38,374
[SPEAKER_11]: speak.

1291
02:01:38,394 --> 02:01:39,135
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there we go.

1292
02:01:39,836 --> 02:01:40,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Michael.

1293
02:01:40,638 --> 02:01:41,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Micah Kesselman.

1294
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,283
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at 499 Main Street.

1295
02:01:44,425 --> 02:01:47,070
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so much concerned about the placement or the health

1296
02:01:48,268 --> 02:01:48,768
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns.

1297
02:01:49,689 --> 02:01:59,237
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I am curious about, and this was asked earlier and wasn't answered, is what is Medford getting back from Verizon in terms of equity to the greater population?

1298
02:01:59,257 --> 02:02:03,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we giving other communities better access to internet?

1299
02:02:04,060 --> 02:02:09,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the municipality getting access to these base stations to use for municipal purposes?

1300
02:02:09,525 --> 02:02:10,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we getting anything from this?

1301
02:02:10,866 --> 02:02:12,967
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, how is this interacting with spectrum law?

1302
02:02:16,610 --> 02:02:24,293
[SPEAKER_00]: basically getting a monopoly on putting up 5G towers and not allowing other competitors to come into the city.

1303
02:02:24,713 --> 02:02:26,594
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are pretty important things for this.

1304
02:02:29,134 --> 02:02:29,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1305
02:02:29,535 --> 02:02:34,316
[SPEAKER_11]: I can speak to whether Medford is getting anything in regards to service.

1306
02:02:34,436 --> 02:02:41,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think specifically the city of Medford is getting specific service from one of these antennas intentionally.

1307
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:44,860
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not aware of any other

1308
02:02:46,208 --> 02:02:49,190
[SPEAKER_11]: things that the city might be getting, as far as I know.

1309
02:02:49,991 --> 02:02:50,992
[SPEAKER_11]: That answers your first question.

1310
02:02:51,012 --> 02:02:56,937
[SPEAKER_11]: The spectrum law question, can someone from Verizon address that?

1311
02:02:57,277 --> 02:03:00,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Verizon setting up a monopoly of service here in Medford?

1312
02:03:05,444 --> 02:03:08,566
[SPEAKER_27]: Verizon can only operate in the spectrum that it owns.

1313
02:03:08,806 --> 02:03:12,449
[SPEAKER_27]: There are other carriers that have other spectrum that they can operate in.

1314
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:15,872
[SPEAKER_27]: Any carrier could come to Medford and operate under this policy.

1315
02:03:17,233 --> 02:03:20,554
[SPEAKER_27]: And in other communities, there are multiple carriers that do that.

1316
02:03:22,714 --> 02:03:23,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1317
02:03:24,735 --> 02:03:42,839
[SPEAKER_11]: So if just hypothetically, if AT&T or Sprint or whoever wanted to install 5G small cell networks, they would be operating under the same set of federal law and policy or ordinance, whatever it may be at the time here in the city of Medford.

1318
02:03:47,308 --> 02:03:55,195
[SPEAKER_11]: So they would have to find bowl locations, and they would have to find places for their antennas, if that's the case.

1319
02:03:55,215 --> 02:03:57,377
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Amanda, we'll move on to the next person.

1320
02:03:57,397 --> 02:03:59,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Craig Slatton.

1321
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:02,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Craig.

1322
02:04:05,663 --> 02:04:05,884
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi.

1323
02:04:07,085 --> 02:04:10,387
[SPEAKER_35]: Craig Slatton, 54 Dover Street, Medford, Mass.

1324
02:04:11,989 --> 02:04:12,589
[SPEAKER_35]: Can you hear me?

1325
02:04:13,350 --> 02:04:13,770
[SPEAKER_11]: We can.

1326
02:04:13,870 --> 02:04:14,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1327
02:04:19,486 --> 02:04:22,607
[SPEAKER_35]: I have expertise in occupational environmental public health.

1328
02:04:23,388 --> 02:04:30,930
[SPEAKER_35]: I do not have expertise in the health effects of exposures to non-ionizing radiation.

1329
02:04:33,431 --> 02:04:37,792
[SPEAKER_35]: Dr. Swanson mentioned that he has received support from CTIA.

1330
02:04:38,612 --> 02:04:46,475
[SPEAKER_35]: CTIA's website says that their members include carriers, equipment manufacturers, mobile app developers, and content creators.

1331
02:04:47,887 --> 02:05:09,319
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't expect Verizon to provide an expert who's not aligned with the industry, but I think it is disingenuous of Verizon and Dr. Swanson to present Dr. Swanson as someone who has been doing health research regarding these exposures.

1332
02:05:09,379 --> 02:05:14,882
[SPEAKER_35]: Dr. Swanson's website says, I'm interested in learning how quarks and gluons build the universe.

1333
02:05:16,502 --> 02:05:18,724
[SPEAKER_35]: And I imagine that is his expertise.

1334
02:05:18,964 --> 02:05:22,167
[SPEAKER_35]: And I imagine he's quite experienced at that.

1335
02:05:25,430 --> 02:05:28,673
[SPEAKER_35]: He mentioned that the information is all over the internet.

1336
02:05:28,914 --> 02:05:38,823
[SPEAKER_35]: And I just want to point out that in addition to the information that's all over the internet, and there are a lot of sources on the internet that are not reliable.

1337
02:05:39,479 --> 02:05:59,778
[SPEAKER_35]: I submitted to the committee a list of 42 peer-reviewed studies that have demonstrated mechanisms of cell damage from non-ionizing radiofrequency exposures, including studies by the National Toxicology Program and by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

1338
02:06:01,874 --> 02:06:12,220
[SPEAKER_35]: I asked that if the committee can make that list public in the minutes from this meeting so that others can see that list.

1339
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:14,101
[SPEAKER_35]: I submitted that by email.

1340
02:06:19,841 --> 02:06:24,483
[SPEAKER_35]: Moving forward, I think at this time, this is bad public health policy.

1341
02:06:26,985 --> 02:06:43,814
[SPEAKER_35]: And although the FCC has sort of locked in our capacity to make decisions for ourselves, I'd like to remind everybody that we certainly can make decisions on whether or not we have accounts with Verizon, both as individuals and as a community.

1342
02:06:44,374 --> 02:06:44,734
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1343
02:06:45,795 --> 02:06:46,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1344
02:06:48,458 --> 02:06:58,224
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the end of this period, just so you know, Craig, emails will be read and become part of the public record.

1345
02:06:58,564 --> 02:07:00,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll make sure that that's available.

1346
02:07:01,806 --> 02:07:06,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if we're posting those emails, but I think we're at least reading them.

1347
02:07:07,649 --> 02:07:12,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think you make a very good point there, sharing that information that you've shared with the community.

1348
02:07:13,293 --> 02:07:13,653
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

1349
02:07:13,673 --> 02:07:16,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, we'll move on to the next, please.

1350
02:07:18,007 --> 02:07:24,608
[SPEAKER_17]: And I apologize for the folks that have already mispronounced names and for the future folks whose names I won't mispronounce.

1351
02:07:25,448 --> 02:07:28,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Next person in line, Bryce Shinsuas Kurakula.

1352
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:35,210
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Amanda.

1353
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:37,350
[SPEAKER_44]: I've been called much worse, I can promise you that.

1354
02:07:38,491 --> 02:07:45,852
[SPEAKER_44]: Bryce Shinsuas, I'm representing Kurakula Center, the Tibetan Buddhist temple located at 68 Magoon Ave.

1355
02:07:48,041 --> 02:07:51,843
[SPEAKER_44]: I was recently installed as the new director, though that's not my full-time job.

1356
02:07:53,263 --> 02:07:58,245
[SPEAKER_44]: As I mentioned, we are a Tibetan Buddhist temple with about 300 members.

1357
02:07:58,525 --> 02:08:02,907
[SPEAKER_44]: And so I'm here in my capacity as director of that organization tonight.

1358
02:08:04,408 --> 02:08:13,411
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't think it's controversial to say that throughout history, religious institutions and the scientific community have not always seen eye to eye on every subject.

1359
02:08:14,631 --> 02:08:19,233
[SPEAKER_44]: Many of you are probably not well versed in Tibetan history and you can be forgiven for that.

1360
02:08:20,533 --> 02:08:33,118
[SPEAKER_44]: But I would tell you that actually in the Tibetan tradition, we are actively encouraged to seek out and embrace science and scientific discoveries, especially if that science turns out to prove that we got something wrong.

1361
02:08:34,899 --> 02:08:42,022
[SPEAKER_44]: Mr. Jamo indicated in his first slide that municipalities may not use health concerns as a criterion for evaluating applications.

1362
02:08:43,222 --> 02:08:47,304
[SPEAKER_44]: I apologize to everyone if I missed the statute and case sites in his slide.

1363
02:08:49,173 --> 02:09:04,747
[SPEAKER_44]: Looking at Verizon's Form 10-K for the 2020 fiscal year, page 17 reads, and I'm quoting now, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters.

1364
02:09:05,368 --> 02:09:08,391
[SPEAKER_44]: We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits.

1365
02:09:08,511 --> 02:09:11,573
[SPEAKER_44]: In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.

1366
02:09:12,928 --> 02:09:40,162
[SPEAKER_44]: So if Verizon is so confident in the safety of this equipment, I would be curious to understand, though not strictly within the context of any particular application, why Verizon made the choice to describe these litigation contingencies in such stark language in the introduction in its report, because typically in a 10-K filing, litigation contingencies are disclosed within a footnote to an exhibit table, not as part of the intro to the management's narrative summary.

1367
02:09:41,223 --> 02:09:41,483
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1368
02:09:43,648 --> 02:09:44,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Bryce.

1369
02:09:44,688 --> 02:09:49,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Does Verizon have any response to that comment?

1370
02:09:49,531 --> 02:09:50,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be interested in hearing.

1371
02:09:50,451 --> 02:09:52,012
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure, I'll respond.

1372
02:09:52,052 --> 02:09:58,835
[SPEAKER_27]: My comments were on the subject of what a municipality may do to regulate wireless.

1373
02:09:58,895 --> 02:10:07,979
[SPEAKER_27]: It had nothing to do with the civil suits that this gentleman was talking about or the disclosures that this gentleman was talking about.

1374
02:10:08,739 --> 02:10:11,160
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think I or anybody else on the team

1375
02:10:11,657 --> 02:10:12,918
[SPEAKER_27]: here knows anything about that.

1376
02:10:12,958 --> 02:10:27,664
[SPEAKER_27]: We're here to get these facilities permitted within the confines of federal law, which says that a municipality may not regulate on the basis of the environmental effects of wireless facilities.

1377
02:10:28,024 --> 02:10:32,246
[SPEAKER_27]: And that is the Federal Telecommunications Act that says that.

1378
02:10:33,327 --> 02:10:33,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1379
02:10:33,607 --> 02:10:36,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, we'll go on to the next person, please.

1380
02:10:39,789 --> 02:10:40,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Susan Liebowitz.

1381
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:43,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Susan.

1382
02:10:45,221 --> 02:10:45,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1383
02:10:46,963 --> 02:10:49,504
[SPEAKER_03]: My first meeting, first time meeting attendee.

1384
02:10:50,005 --> 02:10:50,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.

1385
02:10:50,665 --> 02:11:02,112
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's see, I'm just very concerned about the health effects of this proposed 5G installation.

1386
02:11:06,335 --> 02:11:10,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Councilor Mark's comments.

1387
02:11:11,285 --> 02:11:22,449
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of the other members who called for a moratorium on 5G until we are more certain of the health impacts.

1388
02:11:22,969 --> 02:11:32,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, enough scientists and well-regarded figures in public health and so forth have expressed concern.

1389
02:11:32,952 --> 02:11:38,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can we not listen and heed them for once?

1390
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:57,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it is, you know, the FCC's ruling that we cannot make decisions based on health concerns is another that needs to be addressed at the federal level.

1391
02:11:57,826 --> 02:12:02,808
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, it's just unbelievable.

1392
02:12:05,909 --> 02:12:13,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, you know, just a more close to home issue.

1393
02:12:13,545 --> 02:12:29,590
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if this did get installed, which I hope very much it is not, is there, there is no ways to measure, you know, if the radiation is reaching limits that it should not.

1394
02:12:29,850 --> 02:12:31,570
[SPEAKER_03]: There seems to be no way to measure that.

1395
02:12:32,611 --> 02:12:34,911
[SPEAKER_03]: That just seems outrageous.

1396
02:12:36,412 --> 02:12:38,713
[SPEAKER_03]: But I hope it doesn't even get to that point.

1397
02:12:41,212 --> 02:12:45,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So also, Mr. Swanson, I just had one question.

1398
02:12:46,093 --> 02:12:50,134
[SPEAKER_03]: You cited that you're employed by CTI.

1399
02:12:50,154 --> 02:12:58,496
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just curious what that stands for and what kind of company that is, if you wouldn't mind letting us know.

1400
02:12:58,796 --> 02:12:59,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Just curious.

1401
02:13:00,076 --> 02:13:02,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Susan.

1402
02:13:03,037 --> 02:13:05,357
[SPEAKER_11]: The CTI, I believe, was a trade organization.

1403
02:13:08,628 --> 02:13:09,928
[SPEAKER_11]: The acronym, I don't know.

1404
02:13:10,068 --> 02:13:14,010
[SPEAKER_11]: So Mr. Swanson, if you want to elaborate on that acronym for us.

1405
02:13:14,890 --> 02:13:16,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be happy not to.

1406
02:13:17,111 --> 02:13:19,451
[SPEAKER_08]: It turns out it doesn't stand for anything.

1407
02:13:20,111 --> 02:13:20,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, interesting.

1408
02:13:20,952 --> 02:13:24,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't stand for something, but they just use the letters now.

1409
02:13:24,853 --> 02:13:27,354
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, you're not alone.

1410
02:13:27,974 --> 02:13:31,075
[SPEAKER_08]: One of our Supreme Court justices asked the same question.

1411
02:13:34,736 --> 02:13:34,976
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1412
02:13:36,036 --> 02:13:37,997
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll move on to the next person, please, Amanda.

1413
02:13:38,017 --> 02:13:38,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1414
02:13:38,990 --> 02:13:41,713
[SPEAKER_17]: Really quick, Susan, can you state your address for the record?

1415
02:13:43,355 --> 02:13:44,436
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 Roberts Road.

1416
02:13:45,878 --> 02:13:46,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1417
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:48,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1418
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:48,361
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1419
02:13:48,681 --> 02:13:49,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Next person.

1420
02:13:50,022 --> 02:13:51,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Kathleen Rourke.

1421
02:13:53,506 --> 02:13:53,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Kathleen.

1422
02:13:55,709 --> 02:13:56,529
[SPEAKER_47]: Hi, can you hear me?

1423
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:57,791
[SPEAKER_11]: We can.

1424
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:00,101
[SPEAKER_47]: I have two questions.

1425
02:14:00,661 --> 02:14:03,962
[SPEAKER_47]: I think Aaron brought this up earlier and it didn't really get answered.

1426
02:14:04,963 --> 02:14:10,986
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm wondering why this first batch of cell towers is being placed where they're being placed.

1427
02:14:11,086 --> 02:14:17,068
[SPEAKER_47]: They seem to be targeting lower income neighborhoods and I live in one of them.

1428
02:14:18,269 --> 02:14:19,949
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm wondering if that was purposeful.

1429
02:14:20,910 --> 02:14:25,472
[SPEAKER_47]: I'm also wondering if this does go ahead and you're going to put these cell towers in neighborhoods

1430
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:29,282
[SPEAKER_47]: that are more financially disadvantaged than other neighborhoods.

1431
02:14:29,342 --> 02:14:32,623
[SPEAKER_47]: I don't see any cell towers in West Medford or the Lawrence Estates.

1432
02:14:33,464 --> 02:14:37,466
[SPEAKER_47]: Is Verizon, as Mr. Vinay said, you know, we have an equity issue.

1433
02:14:37,586 --> 02:14:41,447
[SPEAKER_47]: Is Verizon going to give people in the low-income housing free Wi-Fi?

1434
02:14:41,467 --> 02:14:46,590
[SPEAKER_47]: Are they going to make up for that in some way where you're, you know, you're coming in on the backs of people

1435
02:14:47,243 --> 02:14:53,086
[SPEAKER_47]: who make less money so that you can get a foothold in this community, what are you giving us back?

1436
02:14:53,126 --> 02:15:10,255
[SPEAKER_47]: Are you gonna give those kids and the school free wifi or is this just let's go in and get like the single moms and the people who are not able to pay attention and get a foothold in this community and then we'll move into the richer, more wealthier neighborhoods because it's too late because we're already in.

1437
02:15:10,695 --> 02:15:14,937
[SPEAKER_47]: I would like Verizon to answer the question as to why they chose those neighborhoods.

1438
02:15:16,237 --> 02:15:19,920
[SPEAKER_47]: And if they're going to, if they're going to give anything back to this community.

1439
02:15:21,561 --> 02:15:22,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1440
02:15:23,662 --> 02:15:28,665
[SPEAKER_11]: The, just to paraphrase the answer that I believe we did receive.

1441
02:15:29,206 --> 02:15:31,848
[SPEAKER_11]: They plan to roll out more this would be the first.

1442
02:15:33,058 --> 02:15:35,759
[SPEAKER_11]: phase of their rollout to get citywide coverage.

1443
02:15:36,799 --> 02:15:45,302
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm gonna let Verizon speak too, but I believe they also had mentioned that the first 44 locations were to cover gaps in coverage.

1444
02:15:45,922 --> 02:15:47,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that's what they stated.

1445
02:15:48,383 --> 02:15:52,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Verizon, would you like to clarify anything that I just said or specifically address the question?

1446
02:15:52,564 --> 02:15:52,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1447
02:15:55,025 --> 02:16:00,267
[SPEAKER_27]: Jason, can you address the basis for these sites, the starting of these sites?

1448
02:16:02,334 --> 02:16:08,159
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, like the chairman said, these are just the first of our applications.

1449
02:16:08,579 --> 02:16:17,886
[SPEAKER_29]: We are looking to deploy throughout the entire city of Medford, and we are not targeting any specific income level in particular.

1450
02:16:17,906 --> 02:16:22,270
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1451
02:16:24,972 --> 02:16:30,476
[SPEAKER_11]: And the second part of the question, I believe the answer is that Verizon isn't planning on

1452
02:16:31,736 --> 02:16:36,946
[SPEAKER_11]: giving anything to the city of Medford in regards to wireless equipment or anything like that.

1453
02:16:36,986 --> 02:16:37,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I have that correct as well?

1454
02:16:41,535 --> 02:16:43,820
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd ask Stan if he could comment on that.

1455
02:16:47,862 --> 02:17:02,309
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, at this juncture we were looking to deploy a network and part of that network is coverage and the coverage is enjoyed by, you know, for instance, public safety offices, you know, being able to fill in the

1456
02:17:03,470 --> 02:17:07,894
[SPEAKER_33]: the gap in existing wireless network.

1457
02:17:08,374 --> 02:17:14,319
[SPEAKER_33]: So I think the benefits are in the network itself, of course.

1458
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:26,809
[SPEAKER_33]: And we do, of course, offer competitive grants, which the city has taken part of in the past in terms of education.

1459
02:17:26,849 --> 02:17:30,172
[SPEAKER_33]: But there is nothing specifically that would warrant us

1460
02:17:34,169 --> 02:17:35,670
[SPEAKER_33]: giving out something, if you will.

1461
02:17:36,210 --> 02:17:38,612
[SPEAKER_33]: This is about deploying an entire network.

1462
02:17:41,274 --> 02:17:41,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1463
02:17:41,655 --> 02:17:43,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, next person, please.

1464
02:17:44,597 --> 02:17:48,080
[SPEAKER_17]: And really quick, Kathleen, could you just provide your address for the record?

1465
02:17:50,422 --> 02:17:51,383
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Logan Abb.

1466
02:17:52,343 --> 02:17:54,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1467
02:17:54,685 --> 02:17:56,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Carolyn's iPhone is next in the queue.

1468
02:17:58,909 --> 02:17:59,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Carolyn.

1469
02:18:01,002 --> 02:18:02,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, thanks, Mr. Chairman.

1470
02:18:03,804 --> 02:18:21,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this has already been asked, but I don't think residents have received an adequate answer, but I think we'd like to know how and why these particular locations were selected, what the reasoning was behind

1471
02:18:22,392 --> 02:18:25,716
[SPEAKER_07]: selecting these 44 locations specifically.

1472
02:18:25,736 --> 02:18:34,366
[SPEAKER_07]: My next question is, I think everyone in the city knows there's significant coverage gaps at the high school.

1473
02:18:35,247 --> 02:18:39,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Are 5G small cells allowed to be located at schools?

1474
02:18:40,433 --> 02:18:42,355
[SPEAKER_07]: And if not, can you explain why?

1475
02:18:44,475 --> 02:18:56,866
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dr. Swanson had mentioned that the 5G technology is safe as long as you're outside a couple of feet of the technology.

1476
02:18:56,886 --> 02:19:03,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wondering what are the negative effects if you did get within a couple of feet of the small cell technology?

1477
02:19:04,913 --> 02:19:05,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1478
02:19:06,554 --> 02:19:07,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1479
02:19:09,217 --> 02:19:10,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one second, taking a note here.

1480
02:19:12,501 --> 02:19:15,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Carolyn, could you provide your full name and address for the record?

1481
02:19:21,846 --> 02:19:22,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sorry.

1482
02:19:22,547 --> 02:19:25,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Carolyn Montello, 108 Ashcroft Road.

1483
02:19:25,429 --> 02:19:37,035
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so the three questions, how and why these 44 locations were specifically selected.

1484
02:19:37,055 --> 02:19:39,617
[SPEAKER_11]: I will allow Verizon to comment on that.

1485
02:19:39,637 --> 02:19:41,518
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if we're going to get any more information.

1486
02:19:42,167 --> 02:19:44,409
[SPEAKER_11]: out of them in regards to that question.

1487
02:19:45,309 --> 02:19:47,931
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll see if they have anything more to say.

1488
02:19:49,552 --> 02:19:52,054
[SPEAKER_11]: And then are they allowed near schools?

1489
02:19:52,114 --> 02:19:54,035
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they are not, why?

1490
02:19:55,836 --> 02:20:06,704
[SPEAKER_11]: And what are the negative effects if you are within the offset zone where you're going to experience impacts?

1491
02:20:08,777 --> 02:20:09,898
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sure, Mr. Chairman.

1492
02:20:09,918 --> 02:20:16,824
[SPEAKER_27]: So on the specific poll locations, we're happy to get into that when you start addressing the individual poll locations.

1493
02:20:16,864 --> 02:20:22,189
[SPEAKER_27]: Each of the applications, as you know, has an explanation of why that poll location was selected.

1494
02:20:23,390 --> 02:20:27,033
[SPEAKER_27]: In terms of locating at a school, I am not aware of any reason

1495
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:35,041
[SPEAKER_27]: or prohibition on locating near a school unless the city has something we're not aware of, but there's no other reason.

1496
02:20:35,061 --> 02:20:40,062
[SPEAKER_27]: And in fact, we have had these installations approved on streets that have schools.

1497
02:20:41,423 --> 02:20:46,304
[SPEAKER_27]: And the third piece of it in terms of the impacts, that's a hypothetical question.

1498
02:20:46,984 --> 02:20:52,845
[SPEAKER_27]: As we know, nobody's gonna be hanging two feet in front of a pole except the power workers.

1499
02:20:53,369 --> 02:20:56,732
[SPEAKER_27]: And Sean previously addressed what the protocol is for the power workers.

1500
02:20:56,772 --> 02:21:00,895
[SPEAKER_27]: They disconnect the pole before, they disconnect the system before they go up there.

1501
02:21:02,817 --> 02:21:08,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I can answer that in terms of what the physics says, if you like, though, Mr. Chairman.

1502
02:21:08,702 --> 02:21:09,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yeah, take a minute, yep.

1503
02:21:10,063 --> 02:21:10,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thanks.

1504
02:21:12,185 --> 02:21:21,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so if you broke regulations, if you left it on and stood right next to one of these, you would feel a heating, it would be similar

1505
02:21:22,776 --> 02:21:27,899
[SPEAKER_08]: but less intense than when you step from shade into sunlight.

1506
02:21:28,339 --> 02:21:29,560
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you would feel.

1507
02:21:32,002 --> 02:21:32,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

1508
02:21:32,522 --> 02:21:34,884
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Amanda, next person.

1509
02:21:34,924 --> 02:21:39,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Looks like the hands are starting to reduce in number, so anyway.

1510
02:21:40,027 --> 02:21:42,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Nan K is next in the queue.

1511
02:21:43,749 --> 02:21:44,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Nan.

1512
02:21:44,229 --> 02:21:51,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Nan, you with us?

1513
02:21:57,147 --> 02:22:07,273
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we'll go to the next person and if Nan is able to come join us, we'll go to her or him, but let's go to the next person.

1514
02:22:08,754 --> 02:22:15,277
[SPEAKER_17]: So question for you, Mr. Chair, there is a person who had already spoken, that's next in the queue.

1515
02:22:15,357 --> 02:22:21,161
[SPEAKER_17]: Should we continue through the folks who haven't had a chance yet and go back to them or just go to the next person in line?

1516
02:22:22,109 --> 02:22:27,055
[SPEAKER_11]: We should, thank you for the question, we should go to the people who haven't had a chance yet first.

1517
02:22:27,655 --> 02:22:31,139
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so then next in the queue is Donna.

1518
02:22:33,702 --> 02:22:33,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi Donna.

1519
02:22:33,963 --> 02:22:38,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Who I'm actually not seeing in our participants pool.

1520
02:22:40,637 --> 02:22:42,498
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm back on.

1521
02:22:42,538 --> 02:22:47,539
[SPEAKER_46]: I couldn't get my device unmuted.

1522
02:22:47,659 --> 02:22:49,940
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm Nan Kaye.

1523
02:22:51,460 --> 02:22:52,860
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, thank you for your time.

1524
02:22:53,180 --> 02:22:59,222
[SPEAKER_46]: So I feel the next best step is for the committee to deny the applications for the reason to further study 5G.

1525
02:23:00,282 --> 02:23:06,966
[SPEAKER_46]: including health, but also technical, operational, and physical regulations of the equipment.

1526
02:23:07,226 --> 02:23:28,899
[SPEAKER_46]: Verizon's presentation relating to the law and health perspectives conflate the historical data studies and regulations on radio frequency and the unique 5G networks when it serves the purpose of installing the 5G networks, but then they discount the historical radio frequency regulations when it's not convenient.

1527
02:23:29,420 --> 02:23:37,697
[SPEAKER_46]: and in turn appear to be dismissive to the citizens and the committee members trying to educate themselves to be informed on the topic.

1528
02:23:38,158 --> 02:23:40,402
[SPEAKER_46]: If we can further study the issue, I hope

1529
02:23:41,255 --> 02:23:48,703
[SPEAKER_46]: We can hear from a panel of scientists that present different views in terms of what is best for our city.

1530
02:23:49,104 --> 02:23:59,195
[SPEAKER_46]: I do feel, actually, I do not feel it is okay to approve the applications currently with this many Medford residents feeling unsafe.

1531
02:23:59,715 --> 02:24:02,038
[SPEAKER_46]: Feeling safe is a basic human need.

1532
02:24:02,519 --> 02:24:16,157
[SPEAKER_46]: If committee members do not feel they can deny for health concerns, it is reasonable to deny because we do not fully understand the operation and regulation of the equipment, such as the comment referring to the typical equipment

1533
02:24:16,637 --> 02:24:26,790
[SPEAKER_46]: Do we understand if the typical equipment at times can exceed the maximum permissible exposure limits depending on the fluctuating EMFs and the power density?

1534
02:24:27,251 --> 02:24:31,717
[SPEAKER_46]: Verizon commented that has never been questioned on the MPE limits.

1535
02:24:32,318 --> 02:24:34,080
[SPEAKER_46]: How would a citizen monitor and

1536
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:36,342
[SPEAKER_46]: measure exposure to question it.

1537
02:24:36,822 --> 02:24:44,548
[SPEAKER_46]: If eventually installed, is it possible to install a tool that can continuously monitor the exposure since it could fluctuate?

1538
02:24:45,349 --> 02:24:47,731
[SPEAKER_46]: Health effects are not fully understood.

1539
02:24:48,352 --> 02:24:50,733
[SPEAKER_46]: As already stated, many U.S.

1540
02:24:50,774 --> 02:24:56,078
[SPEAKER_46]: cities and countries around the world are studying

1541
02:24:56,958 --> 02:25:04,362
[SPEAKER_46]: not only the thermal effects but the non-thermal effects and they are also slowing and stopping the installation.

1542
02:25:06,083 --> 02:25:13,207
[SPEAKER_46]: Regarding the law perspective, the second slide of the presentation referred several times in capital letters

1543
02:25:13,547 --> 02:25:19,372
[SPEAKER_46]: to federal law, but what federal laws are you referring to, and what are the dates of those laws?

1544
02:25:20,513 --> 02:25:26,838
[SPEAKER_46]: In terms of the business perspective, it's a false narrative, selling that it is needed or Medford will fall behind.

1545
02:25:27,178 --> 02:25:34,965
[SPEAKER_46]: As I said, many cities and countries are not ready for 5G because they're waiting to see its effects.

1546
02:25:35,706 --> 02:25:35,946
[SPEAKER_46]: So-

1547
02:25:39,416 --> 02:25:43,179
[SPEAKER_46]: I like a lot of the residents' ideas if it is eventually installed.

1548
02:25:45,021 --> 02:25:53,048
[SPEAKER_46]: And I still feel like there's not a lot of their questions were answered, such as, you know, who is this Verizon 5G going to serve?

1549
02:25:53,088 --> 02:25:55,069
[SPEAKER_46]: What about the people who don't have Verizon?

1550
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:59,253
[SPEAKER_46]: And what about when other companies want to come in and install equipment?

1551
02:25:59,633 --> 02:26:00,714
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you for your time.

1552
02:26:01,815 --> 02:26:07,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say that we are tasked with

1553
02:26:08,344 --> 02:26:18,552
[SPEAKER_11]: operating under the policy, which was created from the FCC order declaratory ruling, which basically sets up this whole framework.

1554
02:26:19,193 --> 02:26:31,623
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are, again, the committee has to decide what the best move would be for the city and, you know, what a denial would mean and how that would move forward.

1555
02:26:31,643 --> 02:26:36,747
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sort of important to know that and understand that under the federal framework.

1556
02:26:38,167 --> 02:26:39,067
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's really important to know.

1557
02:26:39,668 --> 02:26:54,793
[SPEAKER_11]: So if the committee were to decide to move to deny the applications, where that would put the city and where that would put this set of applications under the law and how that would pan out.

1558
02:26:57,014 --> 02:26:58,135
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's important to remember that.

1559
02:27:00,436 --> 02:27:01,676
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, next person, please.

1560
02:27:03,457 --> 02:27:06,698
[SPEAKER_17]: And Nan Kay, could you provide your full name and address for the record?

1561
02:27:12,050 --> 02:27:14,813
[SPEAKER_46]: Hi, I'm at 70 Marion Street.

1562
02:27:18,536 --> 02:27:19,097
[SPEAKER_46]: Your full name?

1563
02:27:20,178 --> 02:27:21,219
[SPEAKER_46]: Nancy Kopecky.

1564
02:27:22,380 --> 02:27:25,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1565
02:27:25,363 --> 02:27:27,625
[SPEAKER_17]: Next on the queue is Donna.

1566
02:27:29,247 --> 02:27:29,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Donna.

1567
02:27:32,210 --> 02:27:32,870
[SPEAKER_11]: You're muted, Donna.

1568
02:27:40,883 --> 02:27:42,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, my name is Donna Edmonds.

1569
02:27:42,504 --> 02:27:44,045
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 43 Marion Street.

1570
02:27:45,507 --> 02:27:47,548
[SPEAKER_12]: My first question, I guess, is for the committee.

1571
02:27:47,588 --> 02:27:52,752
[SPEAKER_12]: They keep saying that they have to look at these applications.

1572
02:27:52,832 --> 02:27:59,978
[SPEAKER_12]: And my question is, why are cities like Concord and Lexington that are wealthier, why are they able to reject these applications?

1573
02:28:01,339 --> 02:28:04,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it because they have enough money to pay for attorneys?

1574
02:28:06,122 --> 02:28:06,823
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the reason?

1575
02:28:09,410 --> 02:28:10,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a question for me?

1576
02:28:10,730 --> 02:28:10,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1577
02:28:11,631 --> 02:28:12,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not know the answer to that question.

1578
02:28:14,371 --> 02:28:20,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so then my second question is, I mean, I echo all the health concerns that people have already spoken of.

1579
02:28:21,233 --> 02:28:22,894
[SPEAKER_12]: I take care of my 95-year-old mom.

1580
02:28:22,934 --> 02:28:23,734
[SPEAKER_12]: She's lived here since 1968.

1581
02:28:24,594 --> 02:28:29,756
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I've been popping in and out all evening because she keeps calling me for help.

1582
02:28:30,976 --> 02:28:32,677
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're very concerned.

1583
02:28:32,777 --> 02:28:33,057
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean,

1584
02:28:34,507 --> 02:28:35,868
[SPEAKER_12]: We're losing sleep over this.

1585
02:28:36,228 --> 02:28:43,272
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you look at the map, and maybe that comes later, but I mean, the South Medford area is a very dense cluster.

1586
02:28:43,692 --> 02:28:50,516
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there are health concerns associated with one unit, what's gonna happen in our neighborhood?

1587
02:28:50,536 --> 02:28:53,878
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it just makes us feel like a health experiment.

1588
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:58,901
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess that's all I have to say.

1589
02:28:58,921 --> 02:28:59,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Donna.

1590
02:29:00,001 --> 02:29:02,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda, next.

1591
02:29:06,382 --> 02:29:07,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Galaxy Note Oz.

1592
02:29:09,884 --> 02:29:11,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Mr. Note Oz.

1593
02:29:13,125 --> 02:29:13,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

1594
02:29:14,046 --> 02:29:16,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Andrew Oswald, 59 George Street.

1595
02:29:17,267 --> 02:29:21,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering, I guess, a question and a comment.

1596
02:29:22,209 --> 02:29:25,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Where can we find technical specifications on the equipment?

1597
02:29:25,691 --> 02:29:34,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a lot of kind of glossing over of, you know, like we're going to put something up and it looks like this, but I don't see things like

1598
02:29:35,839 --> 02:29:48,410
[SPEAKER_06]: frequency, effective radiated power, antenna gain, perhaps an FCC ID, specifications that would allow us to know exactly what they're putting on the tower.

1599
02:29:48,831 --> 02:29:52,194
[SPEAKER_06]: These are all required for any transmitter or transmission system.

1600
02:29:54,616 --> 02:29:58,500
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess I would sort of also

1601
02:29:59,558 --> 02:30:04,641
[SPEAKER_06]: strongly advise that there shouldn't be a diversion beyond the recommendations of the FCC.

1602
02:30:04,681 --> 02:30:11,306
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that is 10 meters from the transmitter, then I would look at that as a pretty hard rule.

1603
02:30:12,426 --> 02:30:16,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the poles are not tall enough or the houses are too close, then the transmitter shouldn't be located there.

1604
02:30:20,712 --> 02:30:21,732
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you very much.

1605
02:30:23,029 --> 02:30:29,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you please list the items once again that you're curious about, and then we'll have Verizon address that question.

1606
02:30:30,292 --> 02:30:45,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the specifications that they include in the application was the information that was requested in the policy, and that information was provided, but if there's additional information that you're looking to get, maybe Verizon could provide it now.

1607
02:30:46,639 --> 02:30:48,280
[SPEAKER_11]: So could you maybe rattle off that list again?

1608
02:30:58,723 --> 02:30:59,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't unmute.

1609
02:31:00,784 --> 02:31:01,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, are you able to unmute?

1610
02:31:02,204 --> 02:31:04,145
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

1611
02:31:04,245 --> 02:31:05,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1612
02:31:06,086 --> 02:31:08,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So the specifications on the equipment that's being installed.

1613
02:31:08,627 --> 02:31:14,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is the antenna and the gain and radiation pattern?

1614
02:31:14,309 --> 02:31:17,490
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the radiative power of the equipment?

1615
02:31:18,090 --> 02:31:19,671
[SPEAKER_06]: What frequencies does it operate at?

1616
02:31:21,312 --> 02:31:26,874
[SPEAKER_06]: The FCC ID filing for any transmitter is pretty informative.

1617
02:31:28,541 --> 02:31:32,363
[SPEAKER_06]: as to how it was designed and what its operating requirements are.

1618
02:31:34,184 --> 02:31:34,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1619
02:31:35,484 --> 02:31:36,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Verizon team, do you guys get that?

1620
02:31:36,725 --> 02:31:38,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you provide any of that information right now?

1621
02:31:44,029 --> 02:31:45,609
[SPEAKER_27]: Jason, is that information you have?

1622
02:31:47,070 --> 02:31:48,631
[SPEAKER_29]: I have some of the information.

1623
02:31:48,671 --> 02:31:52,533
[SPEAKER_29]: I can say that these antennas are operating in the 28 gigahertz spectrum.

1624
02:31:53,470 --> 02:32:00,094
[SPEAKER_29]: And we are limited to a power maximum of one kilowatt per FCC license.

1625
02:32:01,595 --> 02:32:02,336
[SPEAKER_29]: Wow, that's a lot.

1626
02:32:08,039 --> 02:32:09,860
[SPEAKER_11]: And what about the FCC ID?

1627
02:32:09,921 --> 02:32:11,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that something that we have?

1628
02:32:14,263 --> 02:32:15,144
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I do not have that.

1629
02:32:15,424 --> 02:32:18,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose manufacturer of the transmitter model would also be.

1630
02:32:30,152 --> 02:32:37,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's A3LHT1K01-57A.

1631
02:32:37,897 --> 02:32:49,546
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the FCC report for certification of the Samsung equipment that's proposed.

1632
02:32:49,966 --> 02:32:50,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Samsung?

1633
02:32:51,387 --> 02:32:56,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1634
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:56,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1635
02:32:56,350 --> 02:32:58,472
[SPEAKER_11]: And the applications have the name of the,

1636
02:33:01,337 --> 02:33:19,930
[SPEAKER_11]: The applications themselves have the equipment, the antenna itself is a Samsung HT-IK01 radio unit antenna.

1637
02:33:21,471 --> 02:33:21,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1638
02:33:23,032 --> 02:33:24,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that information on our website somewhere?

1639
02:33:25,417 --> 02:33:29,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, those are on the, all those applications have that information on there.

1640
02:33:29,779 --> 02:33:35,862
[SPEAKER_11]: The FCC report, which is available online, is the testing report that they did.

1641
02:33:35,882 --> 02:33:40,704
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's a large.

1642
02:33:41,364 --> 02:33:42,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1643
02:33:43,205 --> 02:33:45,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to generate them for my products, so.

1644
02:33:45,406 --> 02:33:46,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, all right, so you're aware of it.

1645
02:33:46,846 --> 02:33:48,107
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's where I got the FCC ID.

1646
02:33:48,787 --> 02:33:50,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

1647
02:33:52,889 --> 02:33:54,290
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you.

1648
02:33:54,350 --> 02:33:55,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, next.

1649
02:33:56,113 --> 02:33:57,814
[SPEAKER_17]: Tony is next.

1650
02:33:57,874 --> 02:33:59,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Tony.

1651
02:34:01,675 --> 02:34:02,035
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello.

1652
02:34:02,355 --> 02:34:06,196
[SPEAKER_24]: First, I'd like to thank the chairman for his very organized meeting.

1653
02:34:06,436 --> 02:34:09,957
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, Councilor Marks, your statements were right on.

1654
02:34:11,998 --> 02:34:13,598
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, we're not going to be able to do anything.

1655
02:34:14,439 --> 02:34:17,240
[SPEAKER_24]: They got two big, deeper pockets, as Michael would know.

1656
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:22,501
[SPEAKER_24]: And Stan is just looking on because it's all a done deal.

1657
02:34:23,501 --> 02:34:24,862
[SPEAKER_24]: So what I would recommend,

1658
02:34:25,505 --> 02:34:36,738
[SPEAKER_24]: the city of Medford do is to hold that FCC document of 30 feet or whatever, 30 meters or whatever it is, and not let them get away with it.

1659
02:34:37,539 --> 02:34:45,708
[SPEAKER_24]: Because if we're going to stop this at all or change it, we can't allow them any variances, zero, none.

1660
02:34:46,589 --> 02:34:47,850
[SPEAKER_24]: Because this is a done deal.

1661
02:34:48,470 --> 02:34:51,111
[SPEAKER_24]: Because we'll get sued, as we all know.

1662
02:34:51,672 --> 02:34:54,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Why can Lexington and Concord do it?

1663
02:34:54,893 --> 02:34:55,353
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1664
02:34:56,054 --> 02:35:00,036
[SPEAKER_24]: I had sent the mayor a document from what was happening in Cambridge.

1665
02:35:00,536 --> 02:35:03,357
[SPEAKER_24]: Cambridge got a lot of money, a lot of power, but they're putting them up over there.

1666
02:35:04,338 --> 02:35:14,443
[SPEAKER_24]: So if the FCC says it's 30 meters or 10 meters, if they're 29 and a half, sorry.

1667
02:35:15,965 --> 02:35:17,185
[SPEAKER_24]: That's our only option.

1668
02:35:17,786 --> 02:35:24,248
[SPEAKER_24]: Our only option is to hold what they hold dear, which is the law, which they just happen to help write.

1669
02:35:25,489 --> 02:35:31,231
[SPEAKER_24]: So, Mr. Swanson, I can't believe that you think that the only thing that's important is heat.

1670
02:35:31,691 --> 02:35:39,374
[SPEAKER_24]: If that's the case, then when I go to my dentist and I get an x-ray and she walks out the room, hey, there's no heat.

1671
02:35:39,674 --> 02:35:41,535
[SPEAKER_24]: That thing could be there for a long time.

1672
02:35:42,597 --> 02:35:55,548
[SPEAKER_24]: To only think that heat is the only thing that makes a difference is like thinking that the only thing important is light is, you know, how bright it is as compared to any kind of any other option.

1673
02:35:56,148 --> 02:36:11,381
[SPEAKER_24]: So I, you know, so it's a done deal, you know, sounds like, and that, Tim, we really don't have any options here, but I would highly recommend that we hold them to the letter of the law so Michael can read it for them and not give them anything.

1674
02:36:12,168 --> 02:36:12,608
[SPEAKER_24]: Anything.

1675
02:36:12,628 --> 02:36:14,929
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm done.

1676
02:36:15,769 --> 02:36:16,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1677
02:36:16,890 --> 02:36:19,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we get your name and your address?

1678
02:36:19,891 --> 02:36:24,672
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Tony Nadella and I'm at 33 Frederick Avenue.

1679
02:36:25,452 --> 02:36:27,793
[SPEAKER_24]: And I've been a resident for Medford for over 20 years.

1680
02:36:28,933 --> 02:36:29,214
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1681
02:36:29,254 --> 02:36:31,894
[SPEAKER_24]: And if somebody wants to comment on that, I'd like to come back.

1682
02:36:31,974 --> 02:36:33,295
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd like to make a comment also.

1683
02:36:34,305 --> 02:36:35,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, one second.

1684
02:36:36,006 --> 02:36:37,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Stan, go ahead.

1685
02:36:37,186 --> 02:36:43,608
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, Tim, I just, for the record, just want to let you know that we do have small cell deployment in Lexington.

1686
02:36:45,628 --> 02:36:51,110
[SPEAKER_33]: We go where there is coverage issues, and that's what we try to address with all of this.

1687
02:36:53,131 --> 02:36:55,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

1688
02:36:55,071 --> 02:36:58,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give Verizon an opportunity to address anything that Tony said.

1689
02:36:58,132 --> 02:37:03,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Chairman, can I address the comment about the dental X-ray?

1690
02:37:03,979 --> 02:37:04,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

1691
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:10,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so a dental x-ray is a good example of something that the 5G technology is not.

1692
02:37:11,363 --> 02:37:15,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is a dental x-ray works in the ionizing part of the spectrum.

1693
02:37:16,165 --> 02:37:20,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why it can penetrate your skin and give an image of a tooth.

1694
02:37:21,208 --> 02:37:25,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is a very different thing than 5G or 4G and so on.

1695
02:37:28,492 --> 02:37:28,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1696
02:37:29,852 --> 02:37:31,093
[SPEAKER_11]: And Amanda, we can go to the next person, please.

1697
02:37:33,473 --> 02:37:34,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Next in the queue is Melanie.

1698
02:37:36,878 --> 02:37:37,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Melanie.

1699
02:37:39,862 --> 02:37:41,984
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, this is Melanie Congali.

1700
02:37:42,685 --> 02:37:50,936
[SPEAKER_19]: I reside at 116 Forest Street, and I also have property close to the other installations at Park Street and Stoughton Street by Boston Ave.

1701
02:37:52,466 --> 02:37:55,107
[SPEAKER_19]: I too am just a little bit concerned about the health issues.

1702
02:37:55,508 --> 02:37:59,749
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel more studies need to be done, but I'm not going to go into that because most people have.

1703
02:38:00,850 --> 02:38:10,594
[SPEAKER_19]: What I have a question on though is the number of potential towers that could end up being within the city of Medford.

1704
02:38:12,473 --> 02:38:17,384
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now there's I don't know 40 or 50 permits being applied for at this time.

1705
02:38:17,404 --> 02:38:22,234
[SPEAKER_19]: And my understanding is with 5g that they need to be pretty close together to

1706
02:38:24,246 --> 02:38:25,406
[SPEAKER_19]: for the coverage, right?

1707
02:38:25,726 --> 02:38:33,448
[SPEAKER_19]: And so as you increase the coverage throughout the city, what is the potential for a number of permits being issued?

1708
02:38:33,788 --> 02:38:39,849
[SPEAKER_19]: One, and two, has the committee thought about, is there a number of permits being limited?

1709
02:38:39,909 --> 02:38:49,951
[SPEAKER_19]: So what if AT&T also wants to apply or other wireless companies want to apply for these permits?

1710
02:38:50,551 --> 02:38:51,891
[SPEAKER_19]: Do they work off of the horizon?

1711
02:38:52,548 --> 02:38:54,168
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of those, or do they have to have their own?

1712
02:38:54,228 --> 02:38:54,668
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1713
02:38:55,029 --> 02:38:56,229
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are my questions.

1714
02:38:59,389 --> 02:39:00,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Melanie.

1715
02:39:01,970 --> 02:39:08,311
[SPEAKER_11]: So as far as, we don't have any other applications in front of this committee from other carriers at this point.

1716
02:39:08,791 --> 02:39:10,632
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just Verizon, and it's 44.

1717
02:39:12,272 --> 02:39:17,613
[SPEAKER_11]: And the committee doesn't have, we don't write the policy.

1718
02:39:18,633 --> 02:39:22,214
[SPEAKER_11]: We were placed in the policy as the committee,

1719
02:39:23,488 --> 02:39:24,349
[SPEAKER_11]: with a narrow job.

1720
02:39:26,210 --> 02:39:29,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope that answers your questions.

1721
02:39:30,493 --> 02:39:31,553
[SPEAKER_19]: No, well, no.

1722
02:39:31,774 --> 02:39:37,237
[SPEAKER_19]: So you're saying that we could have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these towers throughout the city is basically what you're saying.

1723
02:39:37,957 --> 02:39:43,181
[SPEAKER_19]: As more and more carriers apply for permits, more and more of these towers could be installed.

1724
02:39:43,201 --> 02:39:43,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1725
02:39:49,931 --> 02:39:52,812
[SPEAKER_19]: And so there was no consideration on, so who wrote the policy?

1726
02:39:52,912 --> 02:39:58,853
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you saying FCC or someone else throughout the city on the number of permits that could be given?

1727
02:39:58,873 --> 02:40:02,074
[SPEAKER_11]: This policy was adopted under the previous mayor.

1728
02:40:04,835 --> 02:40:09,616
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there any, I mean, have you guys considered changing that policy on the number of permits that are allowed?

1729
02:40:13,858 --> 02:40:15,079
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not a question for this committee.

1730
02:40:15,099 --> 02:40:21,084
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be a question for either the mayor or the city council.

1731
02:40:21,405 --> 02:40:31,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Those would be the two entities in the city that have the authority to either create policy, which would be the mayor's authority, or create ordinance, which is the city council's authority.

1732
02:40:32,954 --> 02:40:40,720
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe Councilor Mox might want to take that up and think about the number of permits we want to be issuing as a city overall.

1733
02:40:41,741 --> 02:40:42,602
[SPEAKER_11]: As of now, there is no cap.

1734
02:40:43,377 --> 02:40:44,018
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, okay.

1735
02:40:44,038 --> 02:40:46,340
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1736
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:47,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Next person please.

1737
02:40:47,601 --> 02:40:47,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Marie Izzo.

1738
02:40:48,141 --> 02:40:49,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello Marie.

1739
02:40:49,082 --> 02:40:53,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, this is Marie Izzo.

1740
02:40:54,827 --> 02:40:57,990
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm at 29 Pilgrim Road.

1741
02:41:02,060 --> 02:41:16,263
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm curious if anyone has done any studies on how 5G affects wildlife, birds, bees, squirrels, any sort of animal that might find itself sitting on one of those poles?

1742
02:41:21,444 --> 02:41:22,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Good question, Verizon.

1743
02:41:22,344 --> 02:41:27,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Have any wildlife studies that you're aware of been done?

1744
02:41:27,665 --> 02:41:29,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we know the impacts of wildlife?

1745
02:41:30,698 --> 02:41:34,700
[SPEAKER_27]: Dr. Swanson knows of any, I don't know.

1746
02:41:35,421 --> 02:41:37,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course they study animals.

1747
02:41:37,282 --> 02:41:41,024
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if you consider rats and mice wildlife or not, probably not.

1748
02:41:42,085 --> 02:41:47,128
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that I know of that's referred to a lot is in reference to bees.

1749
02:41:48,088 --> 02:41:52,731
[SPEAKER_08]: There actually is a study on the effect of this radiation with respect to bees.

1750
02:41:53,512 --> 02:41:55,473
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they find is that

1751
02:41:56,793 --> 02:42:06,557
[SPEAKER_08]: the amount of energy that they would be exposed to in their bodies, that they would acquire in their bodies because of it, is about a billionth of a watt.

1752
02:42:07,517 --> 02:42:13,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's unmeasurable, by the way, with normal instruments.

1753
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:17,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So in other words, there's no effect at all on bees.

1754
02:42:17,181 --> 02:42:22,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1755
02:42:22,303 --> 02:42:23,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, next person, please.

1756
02:42:26,288 --> 02:42:49,522
[SPEAKER_45]: Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-K

1757
02:42:50,108 --> 02:42:53,389
[SPEAKER_45]: This is my first meeting, so I'm sorry if you're having to repeat this.

1758
02:42:53,489 --> 02:42:54,109
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay.

1759
02:42:54,249 --> 02:42:56,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that is, you are correct.

1760
02:42:56,349 --> 02:43:01,830
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's whether or not they meet the policy as written.

1761
02:43:03,090 --> 02:43:16,413
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, under the circumstances where the, you know, the applications meet the policy, but the committee denies, then it would likely go to court and the federal law

1762
02:43:16,872 --> 02:43:18,373
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, this has been tested in court.

1763
02:43:19,453 --> 02:43:28,557
[SPEAKER_11]: So we may, we have to make the, the committee needs to make the decision on what's in the best interest of the city based off of what we have in front of us.

1764
02:43:29,618 --> 02:43:33,359
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what we're trying to do here, but appreciate the inquiry.

1765
02:43:36,301 --> 02:43:37,581
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Amanda, anyone else?

1766
02:43:39,982 --> 02:43:45,465
[SPEAKER_17]: There are two individuals that had put in a comment earlier and had re-raised their hands.

1767
02:43:46,956 --> 02:43:49,838
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, and actually I see someone else who is new.

1768
02:43:50,038 --> 02:43:53,000
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll, Michael C if you want to speak first.

1769
02:43:54,981 --> 02:43:55,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi everybody.

1770
02:43:56,262 --> 02:43:57,803
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Michael Caldera.

1771
02:43:57,823 --> 02:43:58,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 33 Governors App.

1772
02:44:00,818 --> 02:44:03,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I am in range of one of the proposed towers.

1773
02:44:04,120 --> 02:44:12,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to be the sole Medford resident other than John Costas to say that I think technology is awesome.

1774
02:44:13,044 --> 02:44:17,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I think infrastructure investment is important for the future of our city.

1775
02:44:18,027 --> 02:44:19,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a scientific background.

1776
02:44:19,548 --> 02:44:20,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I've read the science.

1777
02:44:21,248 --> 02:44:23,870
[SPEAKER_04]: My background isn't in this particular technology, but

1778
02:44:24,550 --> 02:44:33,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I've read plenty of scientific papers and I just want to call out that some of the studies being talked about are disputed.

1779
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:45,553
[SPEAKER_04]: The New Hampshire report being talked about, there was a minority of members of that commission that even said, hey, the way this commission conducted itself was so problematic that we actually

1780
02:44:46,474 --> 02:44:48,716
[SPEAKER_04]: have have to have a counter report.

1781
02:44:49,177 --> 02:44:51,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand this is a polarizing issue.

1782
02:44:52,660 --> 02:45:01,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly respect the, you know, some of the concerns being raised by other residents, especially those in close proximity to some of these devices.

1783
02:45:01,288 --> 02:45:07,955
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I just hope that the committee recognizes that

1784
02:45:08,422 --> 02:45:16,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty big time investment to spend, you know, going on three hours on a call just to say nicely that, Hey, technology is a good thing.

1785
02:45:17,807 --> 02:45:21,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if anyone's familiar with Ashline experiment, right.

1786
02:45:22,229 --> 02:45:27,151
[SPEAKER_04]: The lines, there's a lot of pressure to say the lines are the same, you know, they're, they're different.

1787
02:45:27,431 --> 02:45:28,692
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's the way I'm seeing it.

1788
02:45:28,852 --> 02:45:30,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are residents out there.

1789
02:45:30,753 --> 02:45:31,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the only one.

1790
02:45:32,394 --> 02:45:34,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I appreciate John speaking up.

1791
02:45:34,991 --> 02:45:36,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's others out there.

1792
02:45:36,132 --> 02:45:39,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly encountered them in various Medford groups.

1793
02:45:39,954 --> 02:45:42,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think this is a settled issue.

1794
02:45:43,315 --> 02:45:46,117
[SPEAKER_04]: So just wanted to get that information out there.

1795
02:45:46,277 --> 02:45:46,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1796
02:45:47,697 --> 02:45:48,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Michael.

1797
02:45:49,418 --> 02:45:54,721
[SPEAKER_11]: And the remaining two folks who have their hands up, I believe have spoke before.

1798
02:45:54,801 --> 02:45:58,383
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have something new to say, we will entertain it, but please try to be brief.

1799
02:46:00,984 --> 02:46:02,285
[SPEAKER_11]: We can pick whoever is next, Mona.

1800
02:46:03,232 --> 02:46:06,874
[SPEAKER_17]: So Delphine Picard had her hand raised earlier.

1801
02:46:06,894 --> 02:46:11,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, can you hear me?

1802
02:46:12,457 --> 02:46:12,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi Delphine.

1803
02:46:13,698 --> 02:46:14,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

1804
02:46:14,819 --> 02:46:26,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Just wanted to mention since we were talking about mainstream science, and I do believe that, as far as I'm concerned, that it's more, you know, scientists without ties to the industry that matter, but

1805
02:46:26,885 --> 02:46:43,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Since we're talking about mainstream science, I just want to mention a US national toxicology program that found clear evidence in 2018 that two years of exposure to cell phone RFR increases cancer in male rats and damaged DNA in rats and mice of both sexes.

1806
02:46:44,110 --> 02:46:50,752
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to mention that the IARC, which is the International Agency for Research on Cancer,

1807
02:46:52,893 --> 02:46:57,355
[SPEAKER_14]: has recently prioritized RFR to be reviewed again in the next five years.

1808
02:46:58,476 --> 02:47:07,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to say that there are, you know, matron scientists probably in these agencies that care about RFR.

1809
02:47:07,921 --> 02:47:14,244
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the 252 scientists, which I believe is the right number,

1810
02:47:16,105 --> 02:47:19,568
[SPEAKER_14]: are not against 6 million other doctors and scientists at all.

1811
02:47:20,308 --> 02:47:31,237
[SPEAKER_14]: I think mainstream science is definitely at the state of the World Health Organization concerned about health issues.

1812
02:47:31,958 --> 02:47:32,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1813
02:47:34,480 --> 02:47:35,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1814
02:47:35,541 --> 02:47:38,984
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll go with that one other person who wanted to speak.

1815
02:47:39,684 --> 02:47:45,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I actually see three more people, and one of them is a new commenter, Carol.

1816
02:47:47,268 --> 02:47:49,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Carol, we'll take Carol.

1817
02:47:52,793 --> 02:47:54,634
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, I've been listening.

1818
02:47:54,654 --> 02:48:02,841
[SPEAKER_42]: I did have to jump off briefly to drive home, but I just wanted to echo people's concerns about health effects.

1819
02:48:02,901 --> 02:48:08,486
[SPEAKER_42]: I understand what you said earlier that we can't deny it based on health effects, but I think I live in South Medford.

1820
02:48:08,526 --> 02:48:09,767
[SPEAKER_42]: My name is Carol DeMeo.

1821
02:48:09,787 --> 02:48:12,009
[SPEAKER_42]: I live in 11 Malvern Terrace.

1822
02:48:13,304 --> 02:48:21,267
[SPEAKER_42]: So although I'm not particularly close to the Hancock Street one or the Main Street one, we suffer from a lot of airplane noise here.

1823
02:48:21,947 --> 02:48:26,668
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's just really very detrimental to our health.

1824
02:48:26,748 --> 02:48:30,049
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'm concerned about additional potential health effects.

1825
02:48:30,629 --> 02:48:31,790
[SPEAKER_42]: So I just wanna put that out there.

1826
02:48:32,170 --> 02:48:39,052
[SPEAKER_42]: But also I was interested in hearing from Verizon what the cost of this 5G service is going to be.

1827
02:48:39,492 --> 02:48:42,153
[SPEAKER_42]: Because although they're saying they're trying to expand services

1828
02:48:43,055 --> 02:48:47,779
[SPEAKER_42]: areas of Medford and people that don't have good internet service for school and work.

1829
02:48:48,820 --> 02:48:51,742
[SPEAKER_42]: If the cost is prohibitive, then you're not really increasing access.

1830
02:48:52,142 --> 02:48:56,846
[SPEAKER_42]: You're just making it more difficult for people to gain access to the internet.

1831
02:48:56,906 --> 02:49:00,409
[SPEAKER_42]: So I was kind of curious if there's going to be an increase in pricing.

1832
02:49:00,429 --> 02:49:08,335
[SPEAKER_42]: I know this isn't probably the meeting to talk about that, but what is this going to cost us as community members?

1833
02:49:08,925 --> 02:49:09,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Carol.

1834
02:49:09,425 --> 02:49:16,749
[SPEAKER_11]: And just the hour that we're getting to and we still have more agenda to get through, and this isn't the right forum to talk about the cost of services.

1835
02:49:17,470 --> 02:49:23,673
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure that that will be an opportunity as a service customer to explore that in the future.

1836
02:49:23,693 --> 02:49:25,934
[SPEAKER_11]: We aren't going to address it tonight, though, I'm afraid.

1837
02:49:26,435 --> 02:49:28,035
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much for your comments, though.

1838
02:49:29,076 --> 02:49:36,180
[SPEAKER_11]: The two people who made comments before, I would ask that if you would only speak again if you do have new information to provide.

1839
02:49:36,878 --> 02:49:40,899
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that said, the two who would like to speak.

1840
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:43,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's open them up please Amanda.

1841
02:49:45,081 --> 02:49:46,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Micah Kesselman.

1842
02:49:47,161 --> 02:49:47,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Micah.

1843
02:49:49,342 --> 02:49:50,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll be quick.

1844
02:49:50,542 --> 02:49:52,603
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came to this meeting actually in support of

1845
02:49:53,946 --> 02:49:55,546
[SPEAKER_00]: at approving these applications.

1846
02:49:55,826 --> 02:50:00,327
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, I think this has been sort of a buckwild disaster of a meeting on Verizon's part.

1847
02:50:01,627 --> 02:50:02,688
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about the health.

1848
02:50:03,148 --> 02:50:19,110
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I am disappointed by is that you are asking to basically come in with a monopoly on a service on a disaggregated, decentralized internet connectivity that's going to be extremely important in the next few years without any sense of a collaborative spirit with the community.

1849
02:50:19,831 --> 02:50:21,531
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've literally said you don't feel any

1850
02:50:23,244 --> 02:50:24,845
[SPEAKER_00]: need to give back to the community.

1851
02:50:25,105 --> 02:50:26,926
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's buck wild to me.

1852
02:50:27,026 --> 02:50:31,549
[SPEAKER_00]: And the externalities associated with that stance are also great.

1853
02:50:31,689 --> 02:50:33,070
[SPEAKER_00]: It just blows my mind.

1854
02:50:33,650 --> 02:50:36,272
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if there's any way for us to not approve these.

1855
02:50:36,592 --> 02:50:43,816
[SPEAKER_00]: I urge the committee to reach out to other communities that have been able to avoid this disaster.

1856
02:50:44,236 --> 02:50:47,498
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is basically a disaster in the making if we approve these applications.

1857
02:50:49,420 --> 02:50:50,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Micah.

1858
02:50:52,385 --> 02:50:53,106
[SPEAKER_17]: And Tony.

1859
02:50:54,186 --> 02:50:57,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Tony, welcome back.

1860
02:50:57,929 --> 02:50:58,309
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1861
02:50:58,449 --> 02:51:19,243
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just want to mention that on February 8th of 2019, the Connecticut Senator, Senator Blumenthal was asking the communications industry whether or not there was any studies that proved that this was not a problem with health.

1862
02:51:19,984 --> 02:51:21,205
[SPEAKER_24]: And they all said no.

1863
02:51:22,248 --> 02:51:26,690
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm not sure what Mr. Swanson is saying that there's so many studies that have that.

1864
02:51:27,050 --> 02:51:34,112
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I find it also very disingenuous that this gentleman would not tell us what the acronym CTI stands for.

1865
02:51:34,673 --> 02:51:35,733
[SPEAKER_24]: It's such a basic thing.

1866
02:51:35,813 --> 02:51:38,174
[SPEAKER_24]: Nobody gets called XYZ for no reason.

1867
02:51:38,674 --> 02:51:41,075
[SPEAKER_24]: So why can't that question be answered?

1868
02:51:42,076 --> 02:51:44,156
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that we should just delay it as much as possible.

1869
02:51:45,077 --> 02:51:45,397
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1870
02:51:45,837 --> 02:51:46,317
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Tony.

1871
02:51:46,337 --> 02:51:48,558
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you.

1872
02:51:49,177 --> 02:51:51,419
[SPEAKER_11]: That was all very great input from the public.

1873
02:51:51,479 --> 02:51:52,520
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna thank you very much.

1874
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:55,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, go ahead.

1875
02:51:55,142 --> 02:51:56,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, there is one more person.

1876
02:51:57,864 --> 02:51:58,004
[SPEAKER_11]: New?

1877
02:51:58,164 --> 02:52:01,166
[SPEAKER_17]: A former commenter.

1878
02:52:02,147 --> 02:52:02,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Former, okay.

1879
02:52:03,288 --> 02:52:05,009
[SPEAKER_11]: If they can be quick, please.

1880
02:52:05,930 --> 02:52:06,531
[SPEAKER_46]: Nan Kay.

1881
02:52:07,631 --> 02:52:08,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Nan, thank you.

1882
02:52:09,987 --> 02:52:23,630
[SPEAKER_46]: Hi, just the previous last comments there, one person brought up the environmental burden of South Medford residents and the airplane noise is one, but also the air.

1883
02:52:23,850 --> 02:52:32,012
[SPEAKER_46]: So we have air noise, we have the pollution from I-93, and now we have this other environmental stressor.

1884
02:52:32,832 --> 02:52:35,553
[SPEAKER_46]: So I just wanted to add to her comment and also,

1885
02:52:37,033 --> 02:52:48,281
[SPEAKER_46]: the previous person's comment who was for the technology, but, um, is really kind of put off by Verizon's show of care and concern for the Medford residents.

1886
02:52:48,682 --> 02:52:57,188
[SPEAKER_46]: And, um, that, you know, there's this looming threat of lawsuit if we don't comply with what they want us to do.

1887
02:52:57,808 --> 02:53:02,492
[SPEAKER_46]: And I do feel like they really don't care about the residents of Medford.

1888
02:53:03,032 --> 02:53:03,933
[SPEAKER_46]: That's all I have to say.

1889
02:53:03,953 --> 02:53:05,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1890
02:53:07,662 --> 02:53:09,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Stan, you want to respond?

1891
02:53:09,103 --> 02:53:09,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just quickly.

1892
02:53:10,144 --> 02:53:10,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Just quickly.

1893
02:53:11,685 --> 02:53:14,706
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, of course, the wireless network is not a monopoly.

1894
02:53:15,767 --> 02:53:18,889
[SPEAKER_33]: There's fierce competition in this arena.

1895
02:53:19,429 --> 02:53:25,033
[SPEAKER_33]: In addition, we do give back by way of grants and by community engagement.

1896
02:53:25,693 --> 02:53:29,976
[SPEAKER_33]: There's a great deal of volunteer efforts that we are involved with.

1897
02:53:30,731 --> 02:53:32,452
[SPEAKER_33]: that we don't seek credit for.

1898
02:53:32,992 --> 02:53:38,156
[SPEAKER_33]: So we are part of this community, whether you think so or not.

1899
02:53:38,656 --> 02:53:45,481
[SPEAKER_33]: In addition, we've talked about cell towers, not cell towers, they're attachments to existing utility poles.

1900
02:53:46,061 --> 02:53:48,242
[SPEAKER_33]: And the standards are very different for both.

1901
02:53:51,384 --> 02:53:52,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Sam.

1902
02:53:52,865 --> 02:53:57,348
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so just, we did receive emails and we received a petition.

1903
02:53:58,747 --> 02:54:25,072
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know, Amanda, if you and Dave talked about reading that information into the record or not, but I know that we had a petition that 250 residents signed, put their name on basically in favor of granting the applications and a handful of emails in support and also emails in opposition.

1904
02:54:27,177 --> 02:54:32,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Dave or Amanda, does one of you guys want to just go through those quickly to get them on the record?

1905
02:54:32,260 --> 02:54:42,145
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a few of those, which I'm happy to to put on record.

1906
02:54:44,066 --> 02:54:45,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, just give me one second to pull it up.

1907
02:54:46,787 --> 02:54:46,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1908
02:54:52,842 --> 02:54:53,962
[SPEAKER_17]: What would be the best way?

1909
02:54:53,982 --> 02:55:04,525
[SPEAKER_17]: I have, there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 residents who provided emails kind of in favor, but it was the same email script.

1910
02:55:05,085 --> 02:55:07,505
[SPEAKER_17]: Should I list their names and then read the email?

1911
02:55:09,926 --> 02:55:13,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1912
02:55:16,247 --> 02:55:19,068
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anybody else on the committee has any advice in this matter.

1913
02:55:19,328 --> 02:55:21,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not... The email was pretty brief.

1914
02:55:22,729 --> 02:55:29,270
[SPEAKER_16]: When we do board hearings like ZBA and Community Development Board, we typically will read the letter into the record.

1915
02:55:30,810 --> 02:55:33,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and I'm familiar with the letter.

1916
02:55:34,011 --> 02:55:39,232
[SPEAKER_11]: So Amanda, you wanna just read it and we can list the people who signed on to the letter?

1917
02:55:39,252 --> 02:55:40,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do that way.

1918
02:55:40,413 --> 02:55:41,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, yep.

1919
02:55:42,432 --> 02:55:48,556
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is directed to Director Alicia Hunt from the Community Development Office.

1920
02:55:49,356 --> 02:55:56,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Director Hunt, as a resident of Medford and a Verizon employee, I urge you to approve Verizon's small cell applications.

1921
02:55:57,140 --> 02:56:00,782
[SPEAKER_17]: This initiative is good for consumers and Medford's economy.

1922
02:56:01,282 --> 02:56:11,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Approving Verizon's applications will enable technology companies like Verizon to better meet the increasing demand for high-speed wireless access and to prepare for the coming 5G networks.

1923
02:56:12,053 --> 02:56:16,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Consumers want and need better access to wireless data and information services.

1924
02:56:16,757 --> 02:56:20,800
[SPEAKER_17]: Quicker and cost-effective deployment of wireless infrastructure will make that possible.

1925
02:56:21,160 --> 02:56:31,368
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why I encourage you and all City of Medford leaders to continue to foster technological advancement and investment in Medford and move forward quickly to approve Verizon's applications.

1926
02:56:31,749 --> 02:56:34,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for considering my views and for your service to Medford.

1927
02:56:35,291 --> 02:56:36,712
[SPEAKER_17]: And the individuals that,

1928
02:56:38,512 --> 02:57:05,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Send that email to us is Ellen Markham, 30 Wicklow Ave, Sarah O'Grady, 139 Forest Street, Nicholas Brucado, Unit 210, 100 Station Landing, Thomas Sanchez-Ubich, 61 Locust Street, Apartment 352, Cheryl Nocella, 32 Ashland Street, Susan Barnes, 234 Ashcroft Street, Stacey Marino, 105 Hemans Ave.

1929
02:57:16,179 --> 02:57:16,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1930
02:57:17,821 --> 02:57:22,146
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I was told that Jackie has the rundown of the emails.

1931
02:57:22,787 --> 02:57:27,772
[SPEAKER_11]: So Jackie, if you want to do that for us, that would be appreciated.

1932
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:42,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I could not mute myself.

1933
02:57:43,741 --> 02:57:45,241
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm running through them.

1934
02:57:45,281 --> 02:57:48,183
[SPEAKER_13]: We've gotten a number just since the meeting has started.

1935
02:57:48,203 --> 02:57:53,544
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just running through to tally pros and anti.

1936
02:57:53,565 --> 02:57:55,125
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how you want to categorize them.

1937
02:57:55,625 --> 02:57:57,826
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have the list ready just yet.

1938
02:57:57,906 --> 02:58:05,589
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm happy to just quickly run down or if you give me a few minutes, I can come back and tell you the numbers we have.

1939
02:58:06,928 --> 02:58:09,651
[SPEAKER_11]: In the interest of time, I think we should we should move on.

1940
02:58:09,671 --> 02:58:11,712
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you're ready, let's let's do that.

1941
02:58:11,732 --> 02:58:12,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1942
02:58:12,793 --> 02:58:13,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1943
02:58:13,273 --> 02:58:13,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1944
02:58:14,614 --> 02:58:22,561
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know, Mr. Chairman, I had gotten several emails that I did forward to the information email for five days.

1945
02:58:22,601 --> 02:58:23,701
[SPEAKER_11]: So great.

1946
02:58:23,741 --> 02:58:24,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1947
02:58:24,042 --> 02:58:27,625
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're gonna move on to

1948
02:58:33,119 --> 02:58:35,840
[SPEAKER_11]: move on to the applications in South Medford vicinity.

1949
02:58:36,440 --> 02:58:40,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, if you could share your screen with the map locations, I'll read the locations.

1950
02:58:41,962 --> 02:58:43,822
[SPEAKER_20]: Excuse me, Tim.

1951
02:58:44,563 --> 02:58:44,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1952
02:58:45,783 --> 02:58:46,603
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry to interrupt.

1953
02:58:46,923 --> 02:58:48,004
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't want to

1954
02:58:49,492 --> 02:58:51,914
[SPEAKER_20]: speak earlier, this is Robyn Stein from KP Law.

1955
02:58:52,754 --> 02:59:13,128
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to confirm with you, I know there's been a lot of discussion tonight about the policy and the legal standards, and I thought this might be a good time to ask if you had any questions that you wanted me to address or discuss on those standards before you get into the particular applications, or if there are committee members that have any questions for me, or special town councils.

1956
02:59:14,151 --> 02:59:30,129
[SPEAKER_11]: That's thank you very much, Robin, I think it may be helpful to receive your commentary about the framework legal framework and sort of the potentials of where this could go.

1957
02:59:31,718 --> 02:59:40,185
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, as far as that legal framework goes under federal law, because I know, you know, we're trying to decide what what is the best route for the city here.

1958
02:59:40,245 --> 02:59:47,351
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think to provide me and folks on this call with sort of a breakdown of that legal framework would be very helpful.

1959
02:59:47,911 --> 02:59:50,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And Chairman, could I add that?

1960
02:59:50,253 --> 02:59:52,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I would really love.

1961
02:59:53,530 --> 03:00:03,553
[SPEAKER_18]: specific clarification for everyone on this call, as well as for us on the may not evaluate based on health concerns, because obviously that's the majority of what we heard tonight.

1962
03:00:04,313 --> 03:00:17,217
[SPEAKER_18]: And I feel that we really need to understand where that's coming from and what that's about, because that's my concern and obviously the majority of folks on the call.

1963
03:00:17,277 --> 03:00:19,377
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would love clarification on that.

1964
03:00:19,877 --> 03:00:21,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, and that's why we have Robin here.

1965
03:00:22,528 --> 03:00:23,109
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good point.

1966
03:00:23,129 --> 03:00:25,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Would you like me to do that now?

1967
03:00:25,851 --> 03:00:27,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think now is a good time.

1968
03:00:27,273 --> 03:00:27,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Robin.

1969
03:00:27,794 --> 03:00:28,354
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

1970
03:00:28,454 --> 03:00:35,101
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, this is Robin Stein with KP Law and we are special counsel to the city of Medford.

1971
03:00:35,982 --> 03:00:42,809
[SPEAKER_20]: I know there's been a lot of conversation and comment tonight about effective prohibitions and federal law and the application of the city's policy.

1972
03:00:43,630 --> 03:00:45,232
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought, again, it might be helpful

1973
03:00:45,772 --> 03:00:52,856
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to comment on that before you moved on to site specific considerations, but essentially the federal law in this area is very strong.

1974
03:00:53,436 --> 03:01:02,041
[SPEAKER_20]: And it does prohibit municipalities when acting in a regulatory authority, which is what you folks are doing from effectively prohibiting wireless telecommunication services.

1975
03:01:03,122 --> 03:01:12,027
[SPEAKER_20]: It does prevent the city from regulating those small regulating telecommunications facilities, small cell facilities on the basis of environmental concerns, including health concerns.

1976
03:01:12,661 --> 03:01:20,043
[SPEAKER_20]: So you cannot deny these, at least in my opinion, the federal laws that you cannot deny these based off of health concerns.

1977
03:01:21,123 --> 03:01:30,246
[SPEAKER_20]: And the city has a policy that was developed specifically for small cell and that policy needs to be applied to individual applications consistent with the federal law.

1978
03:01:31,086 --> 03:01:31,826
[SPEAKER_20]: So for example,

1979
03:01:33,356 --> 03:01:47,707
[SPEAKER_20]: In my opinion, you can impose a reasonable condition that's founded in your policy on a particular application, so long as that condition is not going to effectively prohibit the ability to install the facility and to provide the wireless services.

1980
03:01:48,558 --> 03:02:12,140
[SPEAKER_20]: For example, we heard earlier about potential conditions such as providing a structural analysis or an RF affidavit or updated insurance and those, in my opinion, are reasonable conditions that it doesn't seem like should create any kind of prohibition on the ability to provide the services as opposed to potentially some other forms of conditions that might actually result in the service not being able to be provided.

1981
03:02:12,720 --> 03:02:15,262
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, the federal law is very strong in this area.

1982
03:02:15,322 --> 03:02:18,324
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to address any specific questions that you have.

1983
03:02:19,685 --> 03:02:23,187
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, the city has its policy.

1984
03:02:24,548 --> 03:02:34,055
[SPEAKER_20]: That policy has to be applied under the guidelines of the federal law that you have the language that you cannot effectively prohibit the provision of the telecommunications services.

1985
03:02:35,035 --> 03:02:41,380
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, if there are specific questions, I'm happy to get into more detail, but I hope that's a helpful summary.

1986
03:02:44,625 --> 03:02:44,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Robin.

1987
03:02:50,710 --> 03:02:52,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions from the committee?

1988
03:02:57,116 --> 03:02:58,957
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I appreciate that clarification.

1989
03:02:59,097 --> 03:03:04,642
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's helpful for everyone on the call to understand the constraints we're under at this point.

1990
03:03:06,083 --> 03:03:06,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is important.

1991
03:03:07,164 --> 03:03:09,286
[SPEAKER_37]: Mr. Chairman?

1992
03:03:09,887 --> 03:03:10,247
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, Tim?

1993
03:03:11,062 --> 03:03:13,263
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, one follow up question for Robin.

1994
03:03:13,283 --> 03:03:18,324
[SPEAKER_37]: So Robin, you mentioned, we all heard all the concerns tonight.

1995
03:03:18,485 --> 03:03:30,569
[SPEAKER_37]: And if there is a specific concern, like you brought up a structural concern about the poll or the certification that we're waiting to receive on the poll, that would be a legitimate reason for denial.

1996
03:03:30,629 --> 03:03:35,430
[SPEAKER_37]: However, if we had health concerns, we're not going to be that successful in denying it.

1997
03:03:35,450 --> 03:03:36,471
[SPEAKER_37]: Is that what you're saying?

1998
03:03:36,491 --> 03:03:38,391
[SPEAKER_20]: No, that's not what I'm saying.

1999
03:03:38,591 --> 03:03:40,172
[SPEAKER_20]: So for example, if you have

2000
03:03:41,673 --> 03:03:55,336
[SPEAKER_20]: For example, I think it would be reasonable to condition an approval on getting the structural analysis that you need as a condition, because your regulation requires that to be provided.

2001
03:03:56,356 --> 03:04:01,677
[SPEAKER_20]: So long as they can prove that they're structurally sound, I think that's fine.

2002
03:04:02,397 --> 03:04:06,358
[SPEAKER_20]: But the federal law is explicit that

2003
03:04:07,968 --> 03:04:12,793
[SPEAKER_20]: you can't consider environmental concerns, including health concerns, as part of your analysis.

2004
03:04:12,993 --> 03:04:27,228
[SPEAKER_20]: So, for example, if there was a legitimate concern that a poll could not hold one of these and Verizon could not satisfy that, which I honestly can't imagine happening because I can't imagine why any applicant would want to

2005
03:04:28,451 --> 03:04:32,993
[SPEAKER_20]: put their infrastructure on a pole that wasn't sound, we could have that particular conversation.

2006
03:04:33,433 --> 03:04:45,777
[SPEAKER_20]: But to the extent that the question is, we don't have this signed by a structural engineer, I think it would be fair and appropriate to have a condition where you approve the pole, that that be provided before anything goes on the pole.

2007
03:04:47,907 --> 03:04:52,089
[SPEAKER_20]: It'd be a different story if we had actual evidence of an actual structural deficiency.

2008
03:04:52,970 --> 03:05:01,874
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's my understanding, at least, and Tim can speak to that issue, that there are no actual structural concerns with any of the proposed polls.

2009
03:05:03,194 --> 03:05:08,037
[SPEAKER_11]: They submitted calculations, and the calculations aren't certified by a PE.

2010
03:05:09,112 --> 03:05:14,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Paul that could be in what really what Robin so I'm speaking to the committee here.

2011
03:05:15,456 --> 03:05:22,180
[SPEAKER_11]: If we deny based off of health concerns, then the federal law is explicit.

2012
03:05:22,660 --> 03:05:28,504
[SPEAKER_11]: So, the polls that are on the docket in the application, then become contested.

2013
03:05:29,444 --> 03:05:30,005
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, legally.

2014
03:05:30,645 --> 03:05:32,706
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, where does that end up?

2015
03:05:33,007 --> 03:05:43,613
[SPEAKER_11]: That ends up probably with us not winning that legal case and the applications, the, the, um, attendance get installed, you know, as applied.

2016
03:05:43,633 --> 03:05:52,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so which is why I'm getting to this idea of what's in the best interest of the city here and the position that we're in and what we have in front of us.

2017
03:05:53,520 --> 03:05:55,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, does it make more sense to condition, um,

2018
03:05:57,398 --> 03:05:59,119
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a decision that the committee needs to make.

2019
03:06:00,200 --> 03:06:09,946
[SPEAKER_20]: And Paul, to answer your question just generally, I mean, given the strength of the federal law, my opinion generally about these applications is that defending denials is very difficult.

2020
03:06:10,886 --> 03:06:17,170
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's probably very limited circumstances in which you could successfully defend a denial.

2021
03:06:18,271 --> 03:06:23,254
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's generally how the federal law is going to apply to these.

2022
03:06:24,739 --> 03:06:39,070
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman and Kim, but the affidavit requested the policy around the safety officer and such we can't put on as a condition.

2023
03:06:40,582 --> 03:06:44,506
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it would, you know, again, you know, I don't know the Verizon is the objection.

2024
03:06:44,546 --> 03:06:50,812
[SPEAKER_20]: If there was a concern about that, we could discuss, or you could discuss it with them, but I think that would be a reasonable condition as well.

2025
03:06:51,232 --> 03:06:53,434
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think they indicated earlier, they were okay with that.

2026
03:06:53,474 --> 03:06:57,037
[SPEAKER_20]: So to the extent that you were to approve these, you know, you could approve them.

2027
03:06:57,077 --> 03:07:00,681
[SPEAKER_20]: There were three conditions that we, that I had made notes of as you were discussing this.

2028
03:07:00,741 --> 03:07:03,864
[SPEAKER_20]: And the first was the sign up from,

2029
03:07:04,384 --> 03:07:10,805
[SPEAKER_20]: a certified engineer, the second was the affidavit related to the RF compliance, and the third were updated insurance certificates.

2030
03:07:10,825 --> 03:07:19,167
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I haven't heard anything this evening that tells me that any of those would be improper conditions or result in effective prohibitions.

2031
03:07:20,647 --> 03:07:26,869
[SPEAKER_20]: They all seem reasonable and it doesn't sound like Verizon's raised any issues with any of those that would need further consideration.

2032
03:07:26,969 --> 03:07:32,910
[SPEAKER_20]: So those types of conditions, in my opinion, would be very reasonable when they're well within your policy.

2033
03:07:34,981 --> 03:07:35,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Robin.

2034
03:07:37,122 --> 03:07:39,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I will note that there are a couple of people who would like to speak.

2035
03:07:40,845 --> 03:07:52,092
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'd like to do is if those speakers can hang on until the next opportunity for public comment, which is in the site-specific area, just because it's 9, 10 p.m.

2036
03:07:52,152 --> 03:07:53,493
[SPEAKER_11]: and I think we've heard a lot of concerns.

2037
03:07:55,054 --> 03:08:00,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of them aren't necessarily in the purview of this committee.

2038
03:08:01,543 --> 03:08:06,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so with that said, I am going to move on to applications in South Medford.

2039
03:08:06,847 --> 03:08:09,169
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're waiting to speak, there will be another opportunity to speak.

2040
03:08:10,770 --> 03:08:20,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, with that said, um, I do also want to make note of, uh, two objections that I received by phone that were site specific.

2041
03:08:20,698 --> 03:08:22,539
[SPEAKER_11]: One was for 22 Sheppard Avenue.

2042
03:08:22,559 --> 03:08:30,165
[SPEAKER_11]: So the resident lived at 22 Sheppard Avenue and one was, uh, 94 and 96 Stanley Avenue, uh, by Bernadette and Brian Christopher.

2043
03:08:31,388 --> 03:08:33,189
[SPEAKER_11]: and I don't believe they were able to make the meeting tonight.

2044
03:08:33,590 --> 03:08:38,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Just gonna get those vocal by phone call objections on the record here.

2045
03:08:40,733 --> 03:08:42,995
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so applications in South Medford.

2046
03:08:43,035 --> 03:08:46,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, can we open up the map for South Medford?

2047
03:08:51,580 --> 03:08:52,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Share screen.

2048
03:09:02,061 --> 03:09:02,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

2049
03:09:02,461 --> 03:09:03,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

2050
03:09:06,004 --> 03:09:14,091
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we can want to zoom into sort of that bottom piece that's sticking out, I'm not sure how familiar you are with South Medford, but about the bottom third.

2051
03:09:14,131 --> 03:09:14,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there you go.

2052
03:09:15,452 --> 03:09:15,712
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

2053
03:09:16,082 --> 03:09:20,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, all right, I'm gonna read the locations again in case people forgot.

2054
03:09:20,286 --> 03:09:36,800
[SPEAKER_11]: 287 Main Street, 24 Wareham Street, 13 Higgins Avenue, 28 Killscythe Road, 48 Granville Avenue, 25 Dexter Street, 39 Albion Street, 20 Winchester Street, 4 Colby Street, 333 Main Street, 600 Boston Avenue, 13 Newbern Avenue, 8 Alfred Street, 236 Harvard Street,

2055
03:09:45,810 --> 03:09:52,913
[SPEAKER_11]: 549 Main Street, 89 Princeton Street, 62 Marion Street, and 499 Main Street.

2056
03:09:53,633 --> 03:09:57,574
[SPEAKER_11]: That last one is not really at 499, it's closer to the Tufts pool building.

2057
03:09:59,832 --> 03:10:07,419
[SPEAKER_11]: So with this map here, we are open to discussion, the committee, so I'm opening the discussion to the committee members.

2058
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:15,286
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have the map at our disposal so we can, and everything should be labeled there, Amanda, so we can get to where we need to.

2059
03:10:15,306 --> 03:10:20,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just get my list of notes out on the specific locations.

2060
03:10:21,151 --> 03:10:25,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about the rest of you, but I wake up at four, so this is tough for me, but I'll pull through.

2061
03:10:43,265 --> 03:10:45,586
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, here we go.

2062
03:10:45,746 --> 03:10:53,531
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, committee members, do we have any specific questions on specific locations as listed in the agenda for this area?

2063
03:10:54,591 --> 03:11:00,074
[SPEAKER_18]: My only objection would be to any of those that are not 10 meters, about 33 feet high.

2064
03:11:00,634 --> 03:11:00,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Higher.

2065
03:11:00,955 --> 03:11:06,578
[SPEAKER_18]: The lowest point of the antenna, and I believe there was one on Main Street.

2066
03:11:08,159 --> 03:11:10,300
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have it in front of me right now, but.

2067
03:11:14,390 --> 03:11:23,654
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, per the FCC guidelines, and I know they're saying that's from, you know, 20 years ago, but the studies they used, you know, from 20 years ago as well, so.

2068
03:11:26,755 --> 03:11:28,816
[SPEAKER_18]: And do we know which ones those are, or?

2069
03:11:31,157 --> 03:11:33,958
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there was one on Main Street, and I don't have the poll in front of me.

2070
03:11:34,158 --> 03:11:36,459
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it was, let's say 603.

2071
03:11:36,680 --> 03:11:37,840
[SPEAKER_11]: 333 Main Street.

2072
03:11:41,310 --> 03:11:44,332
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Chairman, will we be given an opportunity to address that issue?

2073
03:11:46,753 --> 03:11:48,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I believe you did.

2074
03:11:48,894 --> 03:11:53,677
[SPEAKER_11]: You said it didn't apply, but while I'm pulling the file, if you want to address it, go ahead.

2075
03:11:53,917 --> 03:11:55,237
[SPEAKER_27]: Certainly, yeah.

2076
03:11:55,257 --> 03:12:05,523
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not 100% sure where this information has been coming from, but it is not a regulation of the FCC and it's not a regulation that governs

2077
03:12:06,135 --> 03:12:15,443
[SPEAKER_27]: wireless, that would be a regulation on the basis of health effects of radio frequency, which I think you just heard from your council is not a basis for a denial.

2078
03:12:16,404 --> 03:12:30,836
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe the guidance that's being referred to concerns PCS, which is a type of antenna that operates at macro sites like a cell tower or a building type site.

2079
03:12:31,416 --> 03:12:34,259
[SPEAKER_27]: And the issue that it addresses is whether

2080
03:12:35,482 --> 03:12:40,605
[SPEAKER_27]: how high a pole has to be to be exempt from having to do a study ahead of time.

2081
03:12:40,645 --> 03:12:48,009
[SPEAKER_27]: And the ruling or the guidance at the time was if it was 10 meters or less, then you were supposed to do a study.

2082
03:12:48,029 --> 03:12:52,091
[SPEAKER_27]: It had nothing to do with this kind of technology or these kinds of poles.

2083
03:12:53,032 --> 03:13:02,457
[SPEAKER_27]: Unless someone can point me to something different, I'm fairly certain that that's the source of this 10 meter distance.

2084
03:13:04,705 --> 03:13:08,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct, but there's nothing right now for this type of technology.

2085
03:13:08,988 --> 03:13:13,812
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess my point is that's what we have to rely on for radio frequency.

2086
03:13:15,713 --> 03:13:25,560
[SPEAKER_27]: I would just make the point that if you do rely on that, you're violating the federal regulation, the federal statute that says you can't regulate on the basis of radio frequency impacts.

2087
03:13:26,140 --> 03:13:29,503
[SPEAKER_27]: These facilities comply with the FCC standards.

2088
03:13:30,363 --> 03:13:32,365
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that's the only basis

2089
03:13:33,119 --> 03:13:34,860
[SPEAKER_27]: for that kind of regulation.

2090
03:13:34,900 --> 03:13:43,945
[SPEAKER_27]: The height has nothing to do with anything else other than you're raising it as a rationale for health concerns.

2091
03:13:44,025 --> 03:13:45,046
[SPEAKER_27]: And I just want to point that out.

2092
03:13:49,429 --> 03:13:50,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, back to Aurora.

2093
03:13:50,489 --> 03:13:51,330
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2094
03:13:53,371 --> 03:13:59,414
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually have two other questions completely unrelated to what we've been talking about.

2095
03:13:59,434 --> 03:14:02,116
[SPEAKER_16]: They're much more on the logistical side.

2096
03:14:03,148 --> 03:14:05,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, one is a one off question.

2097
03:14:06,330 --> 03:14:12,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I. Conceding that there are 40 of these and looking at them.

2098
03:14:12,234 --> 03:14:15,596
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that there is one and there might be more than one.

2099
03:14:15,636 --> 03:14:17,237
[SPEAKER_16]: It's at 48 grand lab.

2100
03:14:17,757 --> 03:14:19,558
[SPEAKER_16]: It says the streetlight has to be moved.

2101
03:14:20,099 --> 03:14:30,165
[SPEAKER_16]: I realize this mount might sound petty in front of all of this, but we own the streetlights and we did a big study and figured out you know what's where exactly.

2102
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:38,922
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to understand what that means and what that would entail and who's paying for it and moved where.

2103
03:14:38,942 --> 03:14:44,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Would Verizon like to address that question?

2104
03:14:47,383 --> 03:14:48,283
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 48 Granville Ave.

2105
03:14:48,784 --> 03:14:49,724
[SPEAKER_27]: John, can you address that?

2106
03:14:50,644 --> 03:14:53,824
[SPEAKER_16]: If it helps, it's number 44 of the applications.

2107
03:14:54,925 --> 03:14:55,745
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, thank you.

2108
03:14:57,321 --> 03:15:05,543
[SPEAKER_38]: As I mentioned earlier, when we submit our application, the utility company does make-ready work to make space for our antenna on there.

2109
03:15:06,824 --> 03:15:14,566
[SPEAKER_38]: When they decide what the make-ready work is, they send us an invoice to pay for all the make-ready work, and the utility does prepare the pole for our attachment.

2110
03:15:14,586 --> 03:15:19,447
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a question.

2111
03:15:20,102 --> 03:15:30,547
[SPEAKER_16]: If the utility decides that because the city owns this one, we have to pay for that, can we expect to bill Verizon for the cost of moving it?

2112
03:15:30,567 --> 03:15:35,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's not our choice to move it.

2113
03:15:36,529 --> 03:15:38,230
[SPEAKER_45]: It would cost us a couple of hundred dollars.

2114
03:15:45,133 --> 03:15:48,635
[SPEAKER_27]: Sean, you want to take that one?

2115
03:15:48,655 --> 03:15:48,775
[SPEAKER_38]: Sure.

2116
03:15:50,055 --> 03:15:56,720
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm pretty sure all the make ready costs come to Verizon, but we could work with the city if the city was billed for moving the lights.

2117
03:15:58,781 --> 03:15:59,582
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2118
03:15:59,762 --> 03:16:04,645
[SPEAKER_16]: And hopefully National Grid will speak to us because they don't own those streetlights in Medford anymore.

2119
03:16:06,026 --> 03:16:09,769
[SPEAKER_16]: And they didn't at the time of this application, we bought them in 2017.

2120
03:16:09,809 --> 03:16:10,669
[SPEAKER_16]: I have one other

2121
03:16:15,541 --> 03:16:19,324
[SPEAKER_16]: question that's more in the logistical that actually sounds like this.

2122
03:16:19,704 --> 03:16:33,134
[SPEAKER_16]: A large number of these applications implied, indicated that there would be a new pole at the location or a taller pole, that there was a height of current pole and then a height of a new pole.

2123
03:16:33,374 --> 03:16:36,376
[SPEAKER_16]: I could pick one and give you an example if that's helpful.

2124
03:16:38,178 --> 03:16:43,842
[SPEAKER_16]: Off the top of my head, I'd say there are 15 of these same ballpark

2125
03:16:44,471 --> 03:16:47,572
[SPEAKER_16]: to indicate either a new pole or a pole extension.

2126
03:16:47,672 --> 03:16:53,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Pole extensions make me nervous around safety, physical safety of it.

2127
03:16:53,935 --> 03:16:56,296
[SPEAKER_16]: New poles, I just wanted to know how that was going to play into this.

2128
03:16:56,376 --> 03:17:09,802
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a lot of trouble with new poles in getting National Grid and Verizon to partner together, own and manage the poles in Medford to remove the old poles when we switch from one to the other.

2129
03:17:12,787 --> 03:17:14,148
[SPEAKER_38]: Sure, I can speak to that one as well.

2130
03:17:14,608 --> 03:17:19,011
[SPEAKER_38]: Again, when we file our applications, the utility company decides what the make ready work is.

2131
03:17:19,031 --> 03:17:28,257
[SPEAKER_38]: And as we were talking about earlier, the structural of the old calculation report that they do sometimes comes back saying that we need a new pole to handle the equipment that's going on to the pole.

2132
03:17:28,940 --> 03:17:32,042
[SPEAKER_38]: So, excuse me, National Grid would then replace the pole.

2133
03:17:32,903 --> 03:17:35,685
[SPEAKER_38]: It's up to them on the size that they want to replace the pole at.

2134
03:17:36,046 --> 03:17:45,633
[SPEAKER_38]: They may replace the pole at a higher level based on some future work that they might be coming in there or future attachers to the pole to make room for other people that may want to attach to the pole.

2135
03:17:49,636 --> 03:17:52,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have a time schedule for this work?

2136
03:17:53,639 --> 03:17:56,722
[SPEAKER_16]: And I ask that because in my experience,

2137
03:17:57,437 --> 03:18:03,822
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm putting in a new poll, getting the old one removed, can take multiple years in the city of Medford.

2138
03:18:04,303 --> 03:18:11,868
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hoping that if this is your project, you can make sure that, and Medford residents need double polls.

2139
03:18:12,089 --> 03:18:16,272
[SPEAKER_16]: And if this generates many new double polls, we're just gonna be hearing that on the up.

2140
03:18:17,810 --> 03:18:18,410
[SPEAKER_38]: Yep, certainly.

2141
03:18:18,430 --> 03:18:20,292
[SPEAKER_38]: We don't like double poles either.

2142
03:18:20,312 --> 03:18:23,894
[SPEAKER_38]: To remove double poles, like you said, it does sometimes take a while.

2143
03:18:23,914 --> 03:18:28,477
[SPEAKER_38]: There's other attachers on the pole we need to work with to get them to move their stuff.

2144
03:18:28,858 --> 03:18:33,441
[SPEAKER_38]: And we would certainly take it as a condition of approval that we wouldn't install anything on a double pole.

2145
03:18:33,481 --> 03:18:35,862
[SPEAKER_38]: We'd make sure the double pole is gone before we install.

2146
03:18:38,004 --> 03:18:43,888
[SPEAKER_16]: Which would obviously make it in your best interest to help move along that double pole situation.

2147
03:18:45,129 --> 03:18:45,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

2148
03:18:48,232 --> 03:18:50,694
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, double polls are not allowed per policy.

2149
03:18:52,134 --> 03:18:54,476
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm happy to take that answer blankedly.

2150
03:18:54,856 --> 03:19:01,980
[SPEAKER_16]: I noted on these applications, which ones I thought that was going to occur on, but there's no need to discuss them as individuals.

2151
03:19:03,141 --> 03:19:09,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2152
03:19:09,765 --> 03:19:12,927
[SPEAKER_16]: And, oh my God, Robin.

2153
03:19:13,608 --> 03:19:16,369
[SPEAKER_16]: I noticed that Robin is taking track of conditions.

2154
03:19:17,972 --> 03:19:24,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Assuming that we were to approve these, I would definitely want to include a condition that we're not installing these on double poles.

2155
03:19:24,556 --> 03:19:47,290
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd like to include a condition that if the city needs to incur costs, either because National Grid is pushing them to us or National Grid informs us that we are responsible for moving streetlights, that we would then invoice Verizon or perhaps pass those invoices along to Verizon.

2156
03:19:48,103 --> 03:19:52,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, if for any costs that we incur because of directly because of.

2157
03:19:54,695 --> 03:20:11,963
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure, so I actually, as you were talking in this discussion on Mrs. Robinson again, just were added as conditions to the list I've been keeping track of that Verizon will cover the cost of any so-called make ready work related to moving or relocating any city or lights or infrastructure.

2158
03:20:11,983 --> 03:20:21,728
[SPEAKER_20]: And also that Verizon will not install the equipment on any double poles and will cause the removal of any double poles before installing any of this equipment on a new pole in the future.

2159
03:20:22,848 --> 03:20:30,070
[SPEAKER_20]: So certainly if there's an issue with that, we can discuss it, but my understanding is those are conditions that Verizon is okay with.

2160
03:20:31,771 --> 03:20:32,991
Thank you.

2161
03:20:34,011 --> 03:20:50,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, there is one poll I want to zoom in on, at least here, and it is the one near Stanley Avenue, which if you look at it, it's where Alumni Fields is for Tufts University, Amanda.

2162
03:20:52,100 --> 03:20:54,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Just above that, directly above that.

2163
03:20:57,425 --> 03:21:00,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Move up a little bit where Alumni Fields is, yeah, near Stanley Avenue.

2164
03:21:01,449 --> 03:21:01,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Right there.

2165
03:21:02,510 --> 03:21:02,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2166
03:21:02,890 --> 03:21:04,212
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to zoom in on that location?

2167
03:21:12,379 --> 03:21:12,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2168
03:21:12,940 --> 03:21:14,341
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll leave it right there just for a moment.

2169
03:21:19,949 --> 03:21:22,035
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's under College Avenue.

2170
03:21:22,096 --> 03:21:23,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you click on it and see what it's listed under?

2171
03:21:23,841 --> 03:21:27,632
[SPEAKER_11]: 104 College Avenue, okay.

2172
03:21:46,277 --> 03:21:51,741
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the one that was very close to a building.

2173
03:21:52,061 --> 03:22:01,707
[SPEAKER_11]: As we can see there, that measurement was 18 feet to a two-story dwelling there in the residence on Stanley Avenue, 94 and 96.

2174
03:22:03,468 --> 03:22:07,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Wanted to log their objection to that one.

2175
03:22:07,431 --> 03:22:10,853
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to take a closer look at it, revisit it.

2176
03:22:56,247 --> 03:22:56,567
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is.

2177
03:22:57,888 --> 03:22:58,928
[SPEAKER_11]: It's at the bottom of the pile.

2178
03:22:58,948 --> 03:23:17,477
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just reviewing the location selection criteria submitted with the application.

2179
03:23:29,463 --> 03:23:47,814
[SPEAKER_11]: So this particular location, the alternate locations that were reviewed and didn't meet their requirements and their guidelines were at 104 College Avenue, 105 College Avenue, an unnumbered College Avenue address and 96 College Avenue.

2180
03:23:47,854 --> 03:23:52,397
[SPEAKER_11]: So in this vicinity, and my question

2181
03:23:54,510 --> 03:24:00,991
[SPEAKER_11]: To Verizon, it also states here in this one, it says that this location is not directly adjacent to a park, school, or playground.

2182
03:24:01,631 --> 03:24:04,472
[SPEAKER_11]: While that may be true, there is a school right across the street.

2183
03:24:06,092 --> 03:24:08,833
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe not directly adjacent to it, but it is across the street.

2184
03:24:08,853 --> 03:24:22,015
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering if Verizon could talk a little bit more about the sighting of this particular antenna and why those other locations were not adequate.

2185
03:24:27,835 --> 03:24:29,395
[SPEAKER_38]: Hey, Tim, I can speak to that.

2186
03:24:29,415 --> 03:24:39,818
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know, if we want to go to the street level, I can kind of show you why the polls weren't attachable for us.

2187
03:24:40,258 --> 03:24:41,798
[SPEAKER_38]: I do have some pictures I could show.

2188
03:24:41,818 --> 03:24:46,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, I'm not sure if we can go to street level on this particular map.

2189
03:24:46,079 --> 03:24:50,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you want to describe why, that's fine.

2190
03:24:52,243 --> 03:24:55,085
[SPEAKER_38]: So yeah, so the poll we selected, as you can see, you have the dot there.

2191
03:24:55,125 --> 03:24:59,768
[SPEAKER_38]: So the poll is going to provide good coverage up Stanley Ave and up and down College Ave.

2192
03:24:59,788 --> 03:25:03,731
[SPEAKER_38]: You can kind of see that next poll that's right there at that tree.

2193
03:25:03,751 --> 03:25:05,773
[SPEAKER_38]: It's got some heavy equipment on the top of it.

2194
03:25:06,413 --> 03:25:08,074
[SPEAKER_38]: It's got what's called a primary recloser.

2195
03:25:08,114 --> 03:25:11,757
[SPEAKER_38]: It basically brings the primary power down to another connection.

2196
03:25:11,957 --> 03:25:13,318
[SPEAKER_38]: We can't attach to that poll.

2197
03:25:14,399 --> 03:25:15,680
[SPEAKER_38]: The next poll up is poll 1560.

2198
03:25:15,860 --> 03:25:21,904
[SPEAKER_38]: It would be, I don't know if it's north or south, but north of that poll, I guess.

2199
03:25:22,428 --> 03:25:27,671
[SPEAKER_38]: Above that pole, the next pole up has a transformer on it, so we can't attach to that pole.

2200
03:25:27,691 --> 03:25:40,980
[SPEAKER_38]: And as I had mentioned earlier, as you kind of get further away from the RF selected location, we start to lose the coverage that we wanted to get, and it doesn't allow the network to be contiguous.

2201
03:25:41,941 --> 03:25:47,224
[SPEAKER_38]: So if we go the other way from Stanley Avenue,

2202
03:25:48,136 --> 03:25:53,057
[SPEAKER_38]: And we have at the corner of Stearns and College, it's another pole that has primary reclosers on it.

2203
03:25:54,798 --> 03:25:57,718
[SPEAKER_38]: That's also a three-way junction pole.

2204
03:25:58,158 --> 03:26:04,680
[SPEAKER_38]: So primary power goes up and down the street and then also comes to that pole from another location.

2205
03:26:04,780 --> 03:26:07,401
[SPEAKER_38]: So there's three different connections of primary power on the pole.

2206
03:26:08,001 --> 03:26:11,261
[SPEAKER_38]: They don't let us attach to those poles, National Grid doesn't.

2207
03:26:12,602 --> 03:26:13,362
[SPEAKER_38]: If you move down,

2208
03:26:14,266 --> 03:26:16,228
[SPEAKER_38]: To the next pole is pole 742.

2209
03:26:16,588 --> 03:26:18,289
[SPEAKER_38]: It's another three-way junction pole.

2210
03:26:18,890 --> 03:26:21,112
[SPEAKER_38]: Also has these primary recloses on the top of it.

2211
03:26:22,253 --> 03:26:27,717
[SPEAKER_38]: And then if you move to the next pole, pole 743, that's also a three-way junction pole.

2212
03:26:28,097 --> 03:26:29,619
[SPEAKER_38]: Also has primary closes on it.

2213
03:26:29,939 --> 03:26:39,127
[SPEAKER_38]: So we're basically restricted six poles to either side of the location we selected that we weren't able to attach to.

2214
03:26:39,147 --> 03:26:43,130
[SPEAKER_38]: OK, thank you.

2215
03:26:44,371 --> 03:26:44,651
[SPEAKER_38]: Sure.

2216
03:26:52,580 --> 03:26:56,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any polls that we want to zoom in on, committee?

2217
03:26:58,302 --> 03:26:59,463
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to look at any other ones.

2218
03:27:02,204 --> 03:27:09,308
[SPEAKER_11]: The measurements that I made on these poles as far as distances to structures and things like that, many of them are similar.

2219
03:27:10,449 --> 03:27:15,212
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of the closer ones, which is one of the reasons there was an objection via telephone.

2220
03:27:16,052 --> 03:27:19,314
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to just sort of take a look at this particular one.

2221
03:27:20,555 --> 03:27:27,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of the others, the dwellings are within, you know, somewhere between 20 and 50 feet typically.

2222
03:27:28,267 --> 03:27:46,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, one of the conditions that, um, that I would like to entertain if, uh, we are so moved in that direction would be to, um, confirm many of the things that I've looked at as far as, uh, ADA accessibility.

2223
03:27:47,477 --> 03:27:53,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, any clearances there was one that, uh, it looks like when I measured it, I measured

2224
03:27:53,757 --> 03:27:58,120
[SPEAKER_11]: about three feet, but the gentleman who lived there on Broken Road said it's more like 30 inches.

2225
03:27:58,780 --> 03:28:03,683
[SPEAKER_11]: So if that's the case, you know, that pole doesn't meet the ADA requirements.

2226
03:28:03,863 --> 03:28:11,147
[SPEAKER_11]: So we wouldn't, we want to see a different location or a correction of the pole before the antenna goes on, for example.

2227
03:28:13,148 --> 03:28:13,949
[SPEAKER_11]: With that said,

2228
03:28:17,190 --> 03:28:27,901
[SPEAKER_11]: The next thing to do is to have public comment and for the, I'm sorry, for the committee to discuss these locations and then public participation after that.

2229
03:28:28,622 --> 03:28:34,227
[SPEAKER_11]: And before we do the public participation part, I believe Jackie's ready with the email records.

2230
03:28:35,609 --> 03:28:38,272
[SPEAKER_11]: So what are the feelings of the committee?

2231
03:28:42,901 --> 03:28:48,503
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we hear the general rec email report from Jackie first before being specific here?

2232
03:28:49,364 --> 03:28:49,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm okay with that.

2233
03:28:49,944 --> 03:28:50,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you.

2234
03:28:50,724 --> 03:28:52,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm okay with that.

2235
03:28:52,045 --> 03:28:53,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm okay with that.

2236
03:28:53,565 --> 03:28:54,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Jackie, you ready?

2237
03:28:54,246 --> 03:28:59,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I didn't realize I could unmute myself.

2238
03:29:00,968 --> 03:29:07,151
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have going through the 5G comments number just came in as the meeting was going on.

2239
03:29:07,271 --> 03:29:09,552
[SPEAKER_13]: So by my count, there are

2240
03:29:10,836 --> 03:29:19,398
[SPEAKER_13]: 13 emails in favor of 5G, and that includes a petition with 168 names on it.

2241
03:29:21,118 --> 03:29:25,579
[SPEAKER_13]: So, well, I shouldn't say includes, there's 13 plus the 168 names.

2242
03:29:26,840 --> 03:29:36,622
[SPEAKER_13]: There were 18 emails with general comments and questions that didn't seem to be for or against, and there are 26 emails against.

2243
03:29:39,454 --> 03:29:40,535
[SPEAKER_13]: applications.

2244
03:29:40,555 --> 03:29:44,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of these were for specific locations, others were more general, just against.

2245
03:29:46,119 --> 03:30:02,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, what we're going to do, Jackie, is when we go into specific locations and have the public comment for each location, can you cross-check to see if one of those emails refers to a specific location and we can get the concern on the record?

2246
03:30:02,810 --> 03:30:02,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2247
03:30:03,110 --> 03:30:05,371
[SPEAKER_13]: I have the addresses here, so I can definitely do that.

2248
03:30:06,232 --> 03:30:06,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2249
03:30:07,985 --> 03:30:10,446
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so we're ready to move on.

2250
03:30:10,566 --> 03:30:11,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Should we do those first?

2251
03:30:14,087 --> 03:30:18,208
[SPEAKER_18]: From Jackie, the specific emails and locations before we do.

2252
03:30:18,828 --> 03:30:22,609
[SPEAKER_13]: I can just raise my hand when you get to a specific application if you want.

2253
03:30:23,249 --> 03:30:26,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather do it that way just because I want to go, I just want to read the list.

2254
03:30:27,370 --> 03:30:28,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to go down the list.

2255
03:30:28,411 --> 03:30:29,591
[SPEAKER_13]: How would you prefer that I do it?

2256
03:30:29,611 --> 03:30:36,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want me to raise my hand whenever you get to that specific address or area?

2257
03:30:37,829 --> 03:30:47,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because what we'll do, I'm gonna read the location, the application, and then see if the public has comments and then discussion by the committee.

2258
03:30:47,435 --> 03:30:56,221
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, at this point, we have to vote on each one of them.

2259
03:30:57,342 --> 03:31:02,345
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can, before we vote on the first one, if many of these are gonna be the same, we can talk about

2260
03:31:03,031 --> 03:31:12,298
[SPEAKER_11]: how we're going to move and then what if there are conditions on that we can kind of get those all squared away I have some notes in that in that effect.

2261
03:31:14,460 --> 03:31:18,683
[SPEAKER_11]: So, the, you know, I've thought about this a lot I think the

2262
03:31:19,612 --> 03:31:30,954
[SPEAKER_11]: best way to do it because of the way that, you know, my opinion is the, you know, if we, if we were to deny these for reasons that don't hold water, then these, these go up as is.

2263
03:31:31,614 --> 03:31:37,235
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we condition these, we have at least some, some control.

2264
03:31:40,676 --> 03:31:42,196
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that, you know, that's my opinion.

2265
03:31:42,376 --> 03:31:45,577
[SPEAKER_11]: It's taken me a while to get to that place, but I'm there.

2266
03:31:45,597 --> 03:31:45,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

2267
03:31:49,387 --> 03:31:55,491
[SPEAKER_11]: With that said, let's go to, I'm just gonna go in order that they're listed.

2268
03:31:56,572 --> 03:32:01,315
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, I hope they're the same on my notes that they are in the actual agenda.

2269
03:32:01,336 --> 03:32:02,336
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the agenda just in case.

2270
03:32:02,376 --> 03:32:03,137
[SPEAKER_11]: First one is 287 Main Street.

2271
03:32:03,337 --> 03:32:08,761
[SPEAKER_11]: So if Amanda, you can go to the 287 Main Street one.

2272
03:32:18,441 --> 03:32:21,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we planning to look at each and every location individually?

2273
03:32:23,042 --> 03:32:27,543
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have to look at them individually, but we have to act on each one individually.

2274
03:32:30,564 --> 03:32:31,904
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't do with them as groups.

2275
03:32:32,384 --> 03:32:35,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Excuse me, Tim, this is Robin again.

2276
03:32:35,125 --> 03:32:39,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I clarify, you're also intending to take any public comment on each one, correct?

2277
03:32:39,546 --> 03:32:40,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct, yeah.

2278
03:32:40,886 --> 03:32:41,486
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you.

2279
03:32:42,307 --> 03:32:45,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we talk about the idea of

2280
03:32:51,999 --> 03:32:55,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, continuing the meeting to a date certain because.

2281
03:32:57,403 --> 03:33:07,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Going on to four hours is really like if I thought this was gonna be done in a half hour, but if we were thinking we're gonna be here another two more hours looking at each one of these.

2282
03:33:07,931 --> 03:33:12,475
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we should consider it.

2283
03:33:12,495 --> 03:33:18,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I think the the

2284
03:33:19,380 --> 03:33:27,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I agree, the comment period, I wanted to make sure that everybody had a chance to speak, but your point is well taken.

2285
03:33:29,724 --> 03:33:42,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any sort of framework that is limiting us from doing something like that if we were to do a date certain at some point in the future, Robin or Dave or someone?

2286
03:33:44,048 --> 03:33:45,529
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you might wanna at least

2287
03:33:46,526 --> 03:33:48,408
[SPEAKER_20]: let Verizon comment on their thoughts on that?

2288
03:33:49,028 --> 03:33:53,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just didn't know if the committee had any, if we could even bring that up.

2289
03:33:53,792 --> 03:33:58,755
[SPEAKER_20]: You're well beyond the shot clock dates to act on these.

2290
03:33:58,835 --> 03:34:02,638
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think it's important to get Verizon's feedback on that.

2291
03:34:03,159 --> 03:34:08,523
[SPEAKER_20]: Certainly if it's going to be a brief continuance, you know, into next week or sometime soon, they may have a different opinion.

2292
03:34:09,303 --> 03:34:15,528
[SPEAKER_20]: But I do, you know, you do want to be able to address these thoughtfully and, you know, we are

2293
03:34:15,992 --> 03:34:16,772
[SPEAKER_20]: almost four hours in.

2294
03:34:16,813 --> 03:34:20,595
[SPEAKER_20]: So perhaps let's see what Verizon has to say about that.

2295
03:34:21,275 --> 03:34:22,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'll see.

2296
03:34:22,536 --> 03:34:26,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's put that out there now since Alicia brought it up.

2297
03:34:26,338 --> 03:34:27,499
[SPEAKER_11]: It was something I was thinking about too.

2298
03:34:28,940 --> 03:34:31,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Does Verizon have any strong opinions on the matter?

2299
03:34:31,401 --> 03:34:38,605
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we'd like to proceed as far as we can tonight.

2300
03:34:39,125 --> 03:34:43,328
[SPEAKER_27]: This is something where we've been waiting now for

2301
03:34:44,676 --> 03:34:47,078
[SPEAKER_27]: 15 months or something to have a hearing on these applications.

2302
03:34:47,658 --> 03:35:01,266
[SPEAKER_27]: I know there may be some that you end up having questions on that might have to get pushed off, but I would think for the bulk of these, at this point, having heard all the discussion already, I would think it might move pretty quickly.

2303
03:35:01,286 --> 03:35:05,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2304
03:35:07,049 --> 03:35:11,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we entertain a time cap that we can agree on?

2305
03:35:12,669 --> 03:35:19,793
[SPEAKER_11]: tend to agree that there's been a long waiting period and it makes sense to try to get through as many as we can.

2306
03:35:19,813 --> 03:35:26,958
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, you know, I'm gonna run out of steam around 11, you know, I'm not even gonna be able to function basically, so.

2307
03:35:28,719 --> 03:35:29,539
[SPEAKER_27]: Understood, yep.

2308
03:35:30,240 --> 03:35:32,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, can we revisit this at say 11 o'clock?

2309
03:35:34,282 --> 03:35:35,143
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's revisit it then.

2310
03:35:35,703 --> 03:35:36,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you very much.

2311
03:35:38,365 --> 03:35:46,631
[SPEAKER_18]: Chairman, can I ask that we also, when you're discussing individual ones, can you identify them by poll number?

2312
03:35:47,071 --> 03:35:50,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Because when I go through the applications, the addresses are really hard to find.

2313
03:35:52,816 --> 03:35:54,757
[SPEAKER_18]: But the poll numbers are kind of easy.

2314
03:35:55,898 --> 03:35:58,740
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you mean the application number?

2315
03:35:59,081 --> 03:36:01,943
[SPEAKER_16]: The poll numbers are not on there.

2316
03:36:02,003 --> 03:36:03,344
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, they're on the diagrams.

2317
03:36:03,644 --> 03:36:04,385
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I look at.

2318
03:36:07,192 --> 03:36:10,873
[SPEAKER_18]: Same on the diagrams, the poll numbers are easier identified on the diagrams.

2319
03:36:13,493 --> 03:36:15,833
[SPEAKER_11]: The answer is yes, I have the poll numbers here as well.

2320
03:36:15,953 --> 03:36:16,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2321
03:36:17,074 --> 03:36:17,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, all right.

2322
03:36:18,794 --> 03:36:21,934
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first one we're going to talk about is 287 Main Street.

2323
03:36:38,023 --> 03:36:42,866
[SPEAKER_11]: 287 Main Street is application number three, and it's utility pole number 4136.

2324
03:36:42,906 --> 03:36:50,250
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so we got it, it's right there.

2325
03:36:50,270 --> 03:36:53,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me keep this here.

2326
03:36:53,791 --> 03:37:05,338
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2327
03:37:07,470 --> 03:37:10,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Comments from the committee on this particular location?

2328
03:37:10,712 --> 03:37:27,983
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, hearing none, I'm gonna go to public comment for 287 Main Street, application number three, Utility Poll 4136.

2329
03:37:28,523 --> 03:37:34,787
[SPEAKER_11]: If there are folks who would like to speak on this application, please raise your hand and we'll have Amanda

2330
03:37:36,369 --> 03:37:37,509
[SPEAKER_11]: open you up and you have two minutes.

2331
03:37:49,053 --> 03:37:49,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody?

2332
03:37:54,055 --> 03:37:57,116
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see Amanda, but I see one resident with their hand raised.

2333
03:37:57,956 --> 03:37:59,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I do too.

2334
03:38:01,230 --> 03:38:08,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, sorry, I am not sure how to look at participants while sharing a screen.

2335
03:38:08,072 --> 03:38:09,192
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, OK.

2336
03:38:09,212 --> 03:38:20,395
[SPEAKER_17]: Guess I'll have to stop the share.

2337
03:38:23,396 --> 03:38:27,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we could have Jackie or Dave share the map.

2338
03:38:33,727 --> 03:38:40,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Dave, if you're willing, I'm just sifting the public comments to make sure I don't miss one of the addresses.

2339
03:38:40,833 --> 03:38:41,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

2340
03:38:42,835 --> 03:38:45,317
[SPEAKER_16]: I can do it if you want, or Amanda.

2341
03:38:45,337 --> 03:38:48,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Alicia, if you can do it.

2342
03:38:48,980 --> 03:38:52,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we just need someone to navigate to the spots, that's all.

2343
03:38:53,863 --> 03:38:58,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone's got a job here, so.

2344
03:38:58,367 --> 03:39:02,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, so I see Lou Roy has their hand raised.

2345
03:39:03,958 --> 03:39:05,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, hi Lou.

2346
03:39:05,859 --> 03:39:09,801
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, this is Charlene Roy, 48 Granville Ave.

2347
03:39:10,561 --> 03:39:14,823
[SPEAKER_41]: You mentioned that you were gonna remove the light from the telephone pole.

2348
03:39:15,303 --> 03:39:17,364
[SPEAKER_41]: Are you then gonna leave our street in darkness?

2349
03:39:19,025 --> 03:39:22,606
[SPEAKER_41]: It's one short little street and that street light is pretty valuable.

2350
03:39:27,368 --> 03:39:31,450
[SPEAKER_16]: I think she's speaking to the other one that I mentioned that the street light

2351
03:39:32,823 --> 03:39:33,544
[SPEAKER_16]: 48 Granville Ave.

2352
03:39:33,584 --> 03:39:34,885
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you speaking to that one, ma'am?

2353
03:39:35,986 --> 03:39:37,367
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not on that one yet.

2354
03:39:37,427 --> 03:39:39,229
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get to that one in a few minutes.

2355
03:39:39,929 --> 03:39:40,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'll get to it.

2356
03:39:41,230 --> 03:39:45,514
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that it brings up an idea of a condition.

2357
03:39:45,534 --> 03:39:48,737
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, thank you.

2358
03:39:49,497 --> 03:39:54,001
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we should be removing lights to then make a street dark.

2359
03:39:54,141 --> 03:39:55,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we should be doing that.

2360
03:39:55,402 --> 03:39:59,806
[SPEAKER_11]: So potential for a condition there.

2361
03:40:01,462 --> 03:40:04,262
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so anyone to speak on 287 Main Street?

2362
03:40:04,623 --> 03:40:07,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see anything, so we can go to discussion.

2363
03:40:10,724 --> 03:40:14,124
[SPEAKER_11]: By the committee, I have a couple of things.

2364
03:40:15,124 --> 03:40:29,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in general, I agree if someone on the committee were to move to approve this or grant this one with a condition, then I would recommend that we adopt the condition that

2365
03:40:31,130 --> 03:40:37,312
[SPEAKER_11]: A PE certification has to be submitted by a structural engineer.

2366
03:40:39,553 --> 03:40:40,493
[SPEAKER_11]: We discussed that one already.

2367
03:40:40,913 --> 03:40:57,579
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also a affidavit from an RF professional, signed affidavit, indicating that it meets all the current standards for RF emissions as stated in the policy.

2368
03:40:58,981 --> 03:41:03,962
[SPEAKER_11]: an updated insurance certificate be supplied.

2369
03:41:03,982 --> 03:41:15,204
[SPEAKER_11]: And then as stated in the policy, you shouldn't be going on poles that aren't meeting ADA clearances.

2370
03:41:16,085 --> 03:41:24,126
[SPEAKER_11]: So if the pole is not meeting ADA clearances, for example, you need at least 36 inches between pole and back of sidewalk, then they shouldn't be going up there.

2371
03:41:24,146 --> 03:41:27,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to make that a condition.

2372
03:41:32,301 --> 03:41:39,625
[SPEAKER_11]: They've stated that these aren't in shrouds and they're asking for a waiver of the shroud requirement.

2373
03:41:40,966 --> 03:41:46,849
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I know that's something that's pretty explicit in the policy.

2374
03:41:47,830 --> 03:41:53,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And from what I have been told here at this hearing, that there are shrouding methods.

2375
03:41:55,234 --> 03:41:58,076
[SPEAKER_11]: The shrouding is a aesthetic consideration.

2376
03:42:01,092 --> 03:42:03,613
[SPEAKER_11]: to help with reducing the visual pollution.

2377
03:42:03,633 --> 03:42:09,655
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not exactly sure how we deal with that particular situation.

2378
03:42:09,675 --> 03:42:14,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anybody else on the committee has thoughts on it.

2379
03:42:14,917 --> 03:42:16,518
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a matter of opinion.

2380
03:42:16,538 --> 03:42:24,521
[SPEAKER_16]: I think when you have a shroud around it and it looks like a giant can up there, I'd like that less than the look of an actual antenna.

2381
03:42:25,041 --> 03:42:29,963
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually was unclear why we wanted these to look like they were cans up there.

2382
03:42:31,362 --> 03:42:33,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I tend to agree with you, Alicia.

2383
03:42:33,883 --> 03:42:41,224
[SPEAKER_11]: I think to not have the canister seems like a better option to me.

2384
03:42:46,086 --> 03:42:49,267
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, Tim, comment on those canisters.

2385
03:42:49,307 --> 03:42:54,988
[SPEAKER_37]: Sometimes in the past when we've had, I agree with you, Alicia, because in the past when they try to put some

2386
03:42:56,443 --> 03:43:09,168
[SPEAKER_37]: false chimneys or something of that nature when these are on building tops, they don't really seem to weather well, and it's probably more of an unsightly type of thing than it does any good to camouflage that.

2387
03:43:09,928 --> 03:43:14,610
[SPEAKER_37]: And Tim, on these conditions, a lot of these conditions seem like general conditions.

2388
03:43:14,670 --> 03:43:18,311
[SPEAKER_37]: Are we going to, they're going to basically apply to most locations?

2389
03:43:18,331 --> 03:43:23,113
[SPEAKER_37]: Do you want to make that applicable to all locations instead of reading them, you know, for every particular one?

2390
03:43:24,093 --> 03:43:29,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, Paul, what I kind of want to do is group them and say, those are the standard conditions that apply.

2391
03:43:30,357 --> 03:43:37,102
[SPEAKER_11]: As I've said before, and I think we all know at this point, the equipment is the same, utility, they're all existing utility poles.

2392
03:43:37,682 --> 03:43:43,766
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all within, you know, very similar type settings.

2393
03:43:44,526 --> 03:43:50,030
[SPEAKER_11]: So many of these conditions can be applied to all of them that I'm bringing up.

2394
03:43:51,063 --> 03:44:06,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Chairman, I would forward a motion that they apply to all of them, and that we just blanket those same conditions to everyone, as opposed to going to individual ones and applying those conditions.

2395
03:44:06,808 --> 03:44:12,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I guess that's why, Marion, why I'm reading them now and getting them on the table now, so we can do that.

2396
03:44:12,970 --> 03:44:13,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to do that too.

2397
03:44:15,010 --> 03:44:15,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2398
03:44:15,931 --> 03:44:16,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2399
03:44:18,595 --> 03:44:21,376
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, back to the shroud.

2400
03:44:21,616 --> 03:44:34,199
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I understand it is in the policy, they're asking for a waiver and the committee seems to think that it's better to not have them shrouded.

2401
03:44:35,759 --> 03:44:44,221
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we hold them to the policy, then we have shrouds, canister style shrouds over the antennas.

2402
03:44:44,241 --> 03:44:45,122
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

2403
03:44:49,021 --> 03:45:08,374
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to, if we vote to grant the location, then, or the application, then we're effectively granting that waiver because the applications have that in there stated up front.

2404
03:45:11,076 --> 03:45:11,797
[SPEAKER_16]: We could just,

2405
03:45:12,673 --> 03:45:38,420
[SPEAKER_16]: their chair, we could just check with Robin, should we, because it's clear that that's something that's either for all or none, should we vote in the, like have a separate vote to, like I move to grant them a waiver on the shroud policy, and we vote on that independently of all of these, or should it be in the conditions on each one as it gets

2406
03:45:39,896 --> 03:45:42,757
[SPEAKER_20]: So I tend to agree with Tim's reading.

2407
03:45:42,837 --> 03:45:47,797
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't know that it's, this isn't sub, you know, kind of in the nature of subdivision where you grant a waiver.

2408
03:45:47,817 --> 03:45:54,119
[SPEAKER_20]: In my opinion, if you grant the application, then you're granting what they've applied for.

2409
03:45:54,139 --> 03:46:05,480
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't think a specific waiver is necessary, particularly where you've heard from the applicant that applying that component of your policy may be an effective prohibition and where you're applying a policy consistent with federal law.

2410
03:46:06,021 --> 03:46:07,261
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that it would be fine.

2411
03:46:08,958 --> 03:46:11,399
[SPEAKER_20]: to the extent that you just grant an application, it's granted as is.

2412
03:46:11,419 --> 03:46:27,064
[SPEAKER_20]: I also, to the earlier comment, I think it makes some sense to have you vote to adopt what you're referring to as your standard conditions that you can then in each motion say, this is subject to the standard conditions we've adopted.

2413
03:46:28,445 --> 03:46:35,207
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, we may, before you do that, wanna just run through one more time and make sure everyone's on the same page with what those are.

2414
03:46:36,848 --> 03:46:37,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.

2415
03:46:38,356 --> 03:46:40,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, now Robin, have you been, have you been keeping track of them?

2416
03:46:41,038 --> 03:46:44,821
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not even sure if that, so I can, I can tell you the ones that I have.

2417
03:46:45,582 --> 03:46:45,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2418
03:46:45,682 --> 03:46:46,102
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2419
03:46:46,122 --> 03:46:47,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's pull up on that for the moment.

2420
03:46:47,583 --> 03:46:50,345
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just going as we go.

2421
03:46:50,866 --> 03:46:51,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

2422
03:46:51,246 --> 03:46:51,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

2423
03:46:51,887 --> 03:46:53,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I hadn't written down your noise.

2424
03:46:53,708 --> 03:46:55,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, they did state there was no detectable noise.

2425
03:46:56,130 --> 03:46:57,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I've, I've heard that before.

2426
03:46:57,571 --> 03:47:00,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and then things do end up making noise.

2427
03:47:00,473 --> 03:47:01,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes it's a malfunction.

2428
03:47:02,375 --> 03:47:06,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but I'd like to have a condition in there that, uh, um, they,

2429
03:47:06,853 --> 03:47:08,633
[SPEAKER_11]: don't create any detectable noise.

2430
03:47:09,714 --> 03:47:14,474
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they do, then they need to be repaired, I mean, immediately.

2431
03:47:14,494 --> 03:47:21,616
[SPEAKER_20]: And would that be just no noise that's detectable to the average human ear?

2432
03:47:22,756 --> 03:47:25,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Average human ear, yeah, ground level or in adjacent dwellings.

2433
03:47:25,896 --> 03:47:35,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see what else I had here.

2434
03:47:39,109 --> 03:47:59,331
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to have a condition about post construction testing to confirm that these installations do in fact meet the standards that all the design documents and testing documents tell us that they meet the FCC standards.

2435
03:48:00,956 --> 03:48:08,438
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's kind of wild to me that there isn't a protocol set up, but that's just my civil engineering world, I suppose.

2436
03:48:09,479 --> 03:48:18,981
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, it seems it makes a lot of sense to do follow-up testing on the emissions after it's installed.

2437
03:48:19,362 --> 03:48:24,043
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would want that testing to be done at the threshold of dwellings.

2438
03:48:27,937 --> 03:48:29,398
[SPEAKER_37]: time period for the testing.

2439
03:48:29,438 --> 03:48:32,360
[SPEAKER_37]: Do you have anything in mind on that?

2440
03:48:32,420 --> 03:48:33,420
[SPEAKER_37]: Once every six months?

2441
03:48:34,441 --> 03:48:35,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that.

2442
03:48:35,481 --> 03:48:36,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2443
03:48:36,062 --> 03:48:37,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Some sort of regular intervals, Paul.

2444
03:48:37,863 --> 03:48:38,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2445
03:48:38,063 --> 03:48:39,984
[SPEAKER_11]: They have an annual recertification.

2446
03:48:40,024 --> 03:48:41,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe at the annual recertification.

2447
03:48:42,426 --> 03:48:42,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2448
03:48:43,906 --> 03:48:53,612
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I, I think that's one, we probably going to want to have some discussion with Verizon on only because they're not going to have access to private property per se, you know, but your, your,

2449
03:48:56,892 --> 03:48:58,674
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just looking at the annual recertification.

2450
03:48:58,694 --> 03:49:04,119
[SPEAKER_11]: If private property owners grant permission.

2451
03:49:04,980 --> 03:49:05,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

2452
03:49:05,761 --> 03:49:13,289
[SPEAKER_20]: Guys, I think that's one that we may have to have some conversation with Verizon.

2453
03:49:19,878 --> 03:49:28,566
[SPEAKER_11]: So Verizon, is that something within your capabilities to do field measurements to determine if you're in compliance and generate a short report?

2454
03:49:29,767 --> 03:49:31,929
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think we'd be inclined to want to do that, Mr. Chairman.

2455
03:49:32,670 --> 03:49:35,132
[SPEAKER_27]: We told you we're going to certify that these will comply.

2456
03:49:35,152 --> 03:49:43,119
[SPEAKER_27]: If somebody has different information or if the world changes, as somebody said, and the standards change, then we have to comply with the new standards.

2457
03:49:44,080 --> 03:49:46,082
[SPEAKER_27]: But in terms of a post

2458
03:49:46,845 --> 03:49:56,009
[SPEAKER_27]: construction monitoring of every pole in this city and every other city, you know, or any place, it's just, it's unworkable to have a condition like that.

2459
03:49:56,029 --> 03:49:57,350
[SPEAKER_27]: We would object to that condition.

2460
03:49:57,970 --> 03:50:09,415
[SPEAKER_27]: We are fine with the other conditions you talked about, the certifications, the ADA standards, the fact that if National Grid bills you, we will cover that.

2461
03:50:10,216 --> 03:50:12,597
[SPEAKER_27]: Those are all fine, but not the RF certification.

2462
03:50:14,047 --> 03:50:32,838
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can also just note in section 2L of the policy, and maybe this will help, it requires an affidavit from the applicant certifying that it will maintain the installations in good repair and according to FCC standards and remove any installation that is not in good repair within 30 days.

2463
03:50:34,439 --> 03:50:38,762
[SPEAKER_20]: I wonder if perhaps the committee would be satisfied just with that.

2464
03:50:38,802 --> 03:50:40,843
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what Verizon's opinion is on that,

2465
03:50:42,052 --> 03:50:47,653
[SPEAKER_20]: you do have a requirement in your policy that they keep it in good repair and they certify they'll keep it in good repair.

2466
03:50:48,653 --> 03:50:52,494
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we would not object to that, to having that certification.

2467
03:50:52,514 --> 03:51:04,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and remind me, your engineer stated that these are connected to a system where you receive alarms if it's not functioning properly, is that correct?

2468
03:51:04,276 --> 03:51:04,577
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, 24-7.

2469
03:51:08,084 --> 03:51:12,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that is really the thing that I'm unfamiliar with, right?

2470
03:51:12,225 --> 03:51:27,250
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because the infrastructure that I typically deal with under my purview doesn't have any sort of hardwired situations where it would trigger an alarm, for example, unless you got like a pump system or something like that.

2471
03:51:27,270 --> 03:51:32,612
[SPEAKER_11]: So what does the committee feel about this?

2472
03:51:43,597 --> 03:51:45,098
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like we have to trust that it works.

2473
03:51:45,579 --> 03:51:50,502
[SPEAKER_16]: There are systems that are supposed to notify us, you know, but that aren't, that don't.

2474
03:51:51,043 --> 03:51:52,804
[SPEAKER_16]: And there are systems that absolutely do.

2475
03:51:52,864 --> 03:52:01,251
[SPEAKER_16]: If you manage building controls with an HVAC and you set it up correctly to get notified when a building alarm goes off, you get notified.

2476
03:52:03,492 --> 03:52:09,317
[SPEAKER_16]: I have seen systems that have that functionality that isn't configured and don't notify anybody.

2477
03:52:11,457 --> 03:52:14,118
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to trust that the person who owns it sets it up correctly.

2478
03:52:17,240 --> 03:52:17,960
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree with Alicia.

2479
03:52:18,580 --> 03:52:30,325
[SPEAKER_18]: I think those alarms are set in place and we guarantee that they're monitored and, you know, 24 seven, then we have to trust.

2480
03:52:32,046 --> 03:52:34,547
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what they stated on record in the affidavit.

2481
03:52:35,308 --> 03:52:38,469
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have, right, it's in either the,

2482
03:52:39,692 --> 03:52:51,484
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to, sorry, it's getting late enough that I'm a little less coherent, but it's on the record in a way such that if it became clear to us for some reason, I don't know how,

2483
03:52:52,078 --> 03:52:56,701
[SPEAKER_16]: that they weren't monitoring their alarms, or they weren't functioning correctly.

2484
03:52:57,302 --> 03:53:14,695
[SPEAKER_16]: And there was an issue that we would have recourse to, I don't know, sue them, take action, whatever, as opposed to saying, well, you know about it, but it wasn't a condition, so you couldn't, and wanted that we have some standing.

2485
03:53:16,092 --> 03:53:27,837
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, and again, I think that's what L2L gets to in your policy, that they're going to provide you an affidavit that certifies they're going to maintain the installations in good repair and according to standards.

2486
03:53:27,877 --> 03:53:34,719
[SPEAKER_20]: And that'll be a condition of the license that they provide that affidavit and they in fact maintain them in good repair and according to FCC standards.

2487
03:53:35,940 --> 03:53:38,861
[SPEAKER_16]: And if they don't, we have legal recourse, basically.

2488
03:53:39,041 --> 03:53:43,663
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, you would try to, it's hard to speak to exactly what it was, but

2489
03:53:44,304 --> 03:53:48,166
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, they'd be in violation of their license, so we'd have to take a look at, you know, the next steps there.

2490
03:53:49,226 --> 03:53:50,787
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm commenting them on what it, yeah.

2491
03:53:50,807 --> 03:53:52,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, it makes sense.

2492
03:53:54,028 --> 03:53:56,349
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not clear that we can do any better than that.

2493
03:53:58,370 --> 03:54:06,254
[SPEAKER_20]: Robin, if you're aware of a way we could do better, please feel free to say so, but you know, again, you have to apply your policy and that's what's in your policy.

2494
03:54:06,274 --> 03:54:08,615
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay.

2495
03:54:17,615 --> 03:54:25,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Did anybody else have any proposed conditions that they wanted to include in our slate of standard conditions?

2496
03:54:26,860 --> 03:54:31,382
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard you say the one about costs incurred.

2497
03:54:31,743 --> 03:54:33,503
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you catch the one about double poles?

2498
03:54:33,564 --> 03:54:34,724
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Robin had that one.

2499
03:54:35,485 --> 03:54:38,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, double poles is explicitly prohibited in our policy.

2500
03:54:45,010 --> 03:54:45,290
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.

2501
03:54:45,310 --> 03:54:47,091
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think it hurts to include the condition that

2502
03:54:47,970 --> 03:54:54,413
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, they're not going to install any of the, of these 44 on a double pole.

2503
03:54:54,673 --> 03:55:02,396
[SPEAKER_20]: And to the extent that there's a double pole in the future related to them, they said they would remove the double pole before installing on the new pole.

2504
03:55:03,357 --> 03:55:04,977
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we want to catch in the condition.

2505
03:55:05,838 --> 03:55:06,818
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't object to that.

2506
03:55:07,498 --> 03:55:08,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2507
03:55:08,839 --> 03:55:15,382
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I think that that's very realistic that new poles are going to be installed at some of these locations and

2508
03:55:16,851 --> 03:55:20,634
[SPEAKER_16]: and that they should bear some of the burden of making that move in a timely manner.

2509
03:55:21,975 --> 03:55:24,236
[SPEAKER_16]: In the big picture, we benefit from the new poles.

2510
03:55:24,296 --> 03:55:25,157
[SPEAKER_16]: They're safer.

2511
03:55:25,717 --> 03:55:26,438
[SPEAKER_16]: They're cleaner.

2512
03:55:26,458 --> 03:55:30,120
[SPEAKER_16]: It's safer.

2513
03:55:30,260 --> 03:55:35,704
[SPEAKER_16]: They're actually installing them thicker and deeper because of climate reasons and larger storms.

2514
03:55:36,244 --> 03:55:38,666
[SPEAKER_16]: So we benefit from having new poles installed.

2515
03:55:38,786 --> 03:55:42,088
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't benefit from when the second pole gets left there for a while.

2516
03:55:45,135 --> 03:55:46,935
[SPEAKER_37]: Tim, I have a question for Verizon.

2517
03:55:47,215 --> 03:55:49,756
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it's either Robin or Verizon.

2518
03:55:51,196 --> 03:55:56,617
[SPEAKER_37]: These applications I was looking at, it looks to me they all have meters on the pole.

2519
03:55:56,657 --> 03:55:57,218
[SPEAKER_37]: Is that correct?

2520
03:55:57,278 --> 03:55:58,038
[SPEAKER_37]: Electrical meters?

2521
03:56:00,358 --> 03:56:00,998
[SPEAKER_27]: That's correct.

2522
03:56:02,039 --> 03:56:07,620
[SPEAKER_37]: OK, so we would, if anything with a meter, we would require an electrical permit.

2523
03:56:07,680 --> 03:56:08,380
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm wondering

2524
03:56:09,375 --> 03:56:09,975
[SPEAKER_37]: Two questions.

2525
03:56:10,135 --> 03:56:14,177
[SPEAKER_37]: One, is there any other kind of local permitting required other than an electrical permit?

2526
03:56:14,317 --> 03:56:20,080
[SPEAKER_37]: And two, are there any FCC regulations that may override any local permitting requirements?

2527
03:56:26,103 --> 03:56:26,763
[SPEAKER_11]: I could talk to some of it.

2528
03:56:26,863 --> 03:56:31,325
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know that I looked into whether or not these require trenching, Paul, like if they needed a trenching permit.

2529
03:56:31,485 --> 03:56:34,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And the response was that there is no trenching involved with these.

2530
03:56:34,267 --> 03:56:36,107
[SPEAKER_11]: So they wouldn't require a permit from our office.

2531
03:56:36,448 --> 03:56:37,448
[SPEAKER_11]: That I do know.

2532
03:56:38,032 --> 03:56:39,753
[SPEAKER_37]: They'll come up from overhead then, Tim, right?

2533
03:56:40,173 --> 03:56:42,094
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2534
03:56:42,114 --> 03:56:47,316
[SPEAKER_20]: So generally speaking, the federal law applies to every way that your regulations are applied.

2535
03:56:47,396 --> 03:56:55,019
[SPEAKER_20]: So if it came up that there was an issue, I can't imagine what it would be with an electrical permit, but we'd have to take a look at it.

2536
03:56:57,920 --> 03:56:58,580
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, usually, yeah.

2537
03:56:58,720 --> 03:57:05,703
[SPEAKER_37]: Usually when there's a power source with a meter, it's an electrical call will require an electrical permit for that.

2538
03:57:05,743 --> 03:57:06,323
[SPEAKER_37]: But if there's

2539
03:57:07,164 --> 03:57:11,327
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, something that maybe an exemption for that, Rob, if you could let us know.

2540
03:57:12,007 --> 03:57:13,088
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not aware of any exemption.

2541
03:57:13,128 --> 03:57:16,049
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, if Verizon wants to comment, they can.

2542
03:57:16,790 --> 03:57:23,094
[SPEAKER_20]: My comment was more just that the federal law applies to how these are regulated, not just by this committee, but by the city as a whole.

2543
03:57:24,475 --> 03:57:29,778
[SPEAKER_20]: But I mean, certainly Verizon can weigh in if they think there's some reason they would not need an electrical permit.

2544
03:57:31,419 --> 03:57:32,099
[SPEAKER_38]: I can speak to that.

2545
03:57:32,299 --> 03:57:33,440
[SPEAKER_38]: We would pull an electrical permit.

2546
03:57:34,522 --> 03:57:36,682
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay, yeah, that's what I figured, Sean.

2547
03:57:36,702 --> 03:57:38,343
[SPEAKER_37]: I just wanna get that on the record.

2548
03:57:39,163 --> 03:57:39,463
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2549
03:57:39,483 --> 03:57:40,123
[SPEAKER_37]: Yep, okay.

2550
03:57:44,664 --> 03:57:48,665
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anything else on our slate of standard conditions?

2551
03:57:58,487 --> 03:57:59,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I hear?

2552
03:58:00,040 --> 03:58:05,663
[SPEAKER_11]: any movement, a motion to approve the conditions that we discussed.

2553
03:58:05,723 --> 03:58:11,846
[SPEAKER_11]: And if Robin, I could ask you to, before that happens, if you could just read them back and we can make sure that we have them correct.

2554
03:58:12,586 --> 03:58:14,547
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure, just give me one second.

2555
03:58:14,567 --> 03:58:19,049
[SPEAKER_20]: So I wanna, I have them in shorthand and I just wanna make them more specific.

2556
03:58:19,670 --> 03:58:21,351
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

2557
03:58:21,911 --> 03:58:25,813
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll tell you what I have is that prior to installation of any equipment,

2558
03:58:26,541 --> 03:58:42,974
[SPEAKER_20]: the applicant is going to provide the certification by a registered professional engineer that the pole or location will safely support the proposed equipment as required by paragraph two F of the city's policy.

2559
03:58:46,197 --> 03:58:49,860
[SPEAKER_20]: The second condition I have is that prior to installation of any equipment,

2560
03:58:50,554 --> 03:59:18,258
[SPEAKER_20]: the applicant will provide an affidavit of a radio frequency engineer or radio frequency safety officer with Massachusetts experience that demonstrates that the resulting radio frequency emission level, some equipment installation at the proposed locations comply with the FCC's radio frequency emissions regulations, as well as any Commonwealth of Massachusetts health and safety standards at the street level and at the nearest occupied building.

2561
03:59:19,467 --> 03:59:34,581
[SPEAKER_20]: and that is per paragraph 2H of the policy, that prior to installation of any equipment, the applicant will provide updated insurance certificates as required by the policy.

2562
03:59:34,721 --> 03:59:35,662
[SPEAKER_20]: And I believe that's paragraph 2I.

2563
03:59:35,682 --> 03:59:36,362
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

2564
03:59:46,145 --> 04:00:02,259
[SPEAKER_20]: The next one I have is that the applicant will pay for the cost of any so-called make ready work related to moving or relocating any city lights or infrastructure related to the installation of the equipment.

2565
04:00:04,240 --> 04:00:08,504
[SPEAKER_20]: The next one I have is that the applicant will not install any equipment on double poles.

2566
04:00:09,064 --> 04:00:13,268
[SPEAKER_20]: And if a new pole is installed in the future to accommodate the equipment, they will,

2567
04:00:13,984 --> 04:00:19,006
[SPEAKER_20]: cause removal of any double pole before installing the new equipment on the new pole.

2568
04:00:21,988 --> 04:00:26,210
[SPEAKER_20]: Prior to installing any equipment, they'll provide confirmation.

2569
04:00:26,230 --> 04:00:42,637
[SPEAKER_20]: And Tim, you can tell me on this one, if prior to confirm, I'm sorry, prior to installing any equipment, they'll provide confirmation that the pole meets ADA requirements, if requested by the city engineer, it may be that you don't need these for everyone, or do you want them for everything?

2570
04:00:44,277 --> 04:00:49,720
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm specifically concerned about is horizontal clearances and vertical clearances for pedestrian movements.

2571
04:00:50,300 --> 04:00:54,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so prior to installation of any equipment the applicant provide to the city engineer?

2572
04:00:57,743 --> 04:01:07,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Confirmation that via measurements that the poles meet the required clearances, so.

2573
04:01:08,408 --> 04:01:09,749
[SPEAKER_20]: Horizontal and vertical clearances?

2574
04:01:10,329 --> 04:01:10,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

2575
04:01:10,769 --> 04:01:11,890
[SPEAKER_20]: For ADA compliance?

2576
04:01:12,530 --> 04:01:13,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they've stated that.

2577
04:01:13,971 --> 04:01:19,916
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason I want that as a condition is because we have one that seems to not be correct.

2578
04:01:19,996 --> 04:01:24,199
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have that one on Brogan Avenue.

2579
04:01:25,120 --> 04:01:29,984
[SPEAKER_11]: The gentleman who lives there stated that it's 30 inches as opposed to 36, which is you would need 36 inches.

2580
04:01:30,784 --> 04:01:32,045
[SPEAKER_11]: So those numbers need to be confirmed.

2581
04:01:32,726 --> 04:01:40,532
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so then I also have that the equipment approved

2582
04:01:42,632 --> 04:01:49,455
[SPEAKER_20]: will not create any noise detectable to human ear at the pole location on the ground and at the nearest residence.

2583
04:01:51,096 --> 04:02:07,502
[SPEAKER_20]: And finally that prior to installing any equipment, the applicant will provide an affidavit certifying that it will maintain the installations in good repair and according to FCC standards and remove any installation not in such good repair or not used within 30 days of being

2584
04:02:08,217 --> 04:02:14,699
[SPEAKER_20]: no longer in good repair or no longer in use and will in fact keep the installations in good repair according to FCC standards.

2585
04:02:16,939 --> 04:02:19,460
[SPEAKER_20]: Or good repair and according to FCC standards.

2586
04:02:20,160 --> 04:02:21,721
[SPEAKER_20]: So those are all the conditions I had.

2587
04:02:21,741 --> 04:02:23,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

2588
04:02:25,062 --> 04:02:25,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds right.

2589
04:02:26,642 --> 04:02:28,483
[SPEAKER_20]: My understanding is those are acceptable to Verizon.

2590
04:02:31,984 --> 04:02:35,725
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think it would be fair if somebody wanted to make a motion to

2591
04:02:37,575 --> 04:02:43,839
[SPEAKER_20]: have the board treat these as the standard conditions that you can then incorporate in future votes without reciting each one?

2592
04:02:45,500 --> 04:02:45,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

2593
04:02:46,480 --> 04:02:48,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I hear a motion from the committee?

2594
04:02:48,742 --> 04:02:50,863
[SPEAKER_11]: I make a motion to accept that.

2595
04:02:52,464 --> 04:02:53,244
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

2596
04:02:54,985 --> 04:02:56,286
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will do a roll call vote.

2597
04:02:56,806 --> 04:02:57,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul?

2598
04:02:57,807 --> 04:02:58,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2599
04:02:58,067 --> 04:02:59,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Alicia?

2600
04:03:00,309 --> 04:03:00,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2601
04:03:01,369 --> 04:03:01,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary Ann?

2602
04:03:02,430 --> 04:03:02,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2603
04:03:03,450 --> 04:03:04,411
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm a yes on that as well.

2604
04:03:05,632 --> 04:03:05,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2605
04:03:06,497 --> 04:03:10,420
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a set of standard conditions that we can apply if we move to grant.

2606
04:03:12,782 --> 04:03:16,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're still at 287 Main Street.

2607
04:03:19,108 --> 04:03:32,699
[SPEAKER_11]: And the, let me see, I think the next thing for us to do would be to vote on this, to move, I guess I would need a motion by somebody on the committee

2608
04:03:33,409 --> 04:03:35,930
[SPEAKER_11]: either to grant grant with conditions or deny.

2609
04:03:36,951 --> 04:03:39,512
[SPEAKER_11]: But before we do that, I just want to say a couple of words.

2610
04:03:41,073 --> 04:03:42,653
[SPEAKER_11]: If folks could entertain me.

2611
04:03:42,673 --> 04:03:53,298
[SPEAKER_11]: I have been reading and looking into this topic for for over a year now, since I was tasked with chairing this committee.

2612
04:03:55,369 --> 04:04:06,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And in general, the way that this is, the federal government has limited the municipality and has basically said that, you know, there's not a heck of a lot we can do.

2613
04:04:06,617 --> 04:04:07,918
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't prohibit this.

2614
04:04:08,419 --> 04:04:09,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I disagree with that 100%.

2615
04:04:09,900 --> 04:04:18,746
[SPEAKER_11]: The municipality should be able to represent its residents on technology and installations such as this coming to the city of Medford.

2616
04:04:19,887 --> 04:04:23,910
[SPEAKER_11]: With that said, we are in this predicament as a committee.

2617
04:04:25,147 --> 04:04:35,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that if we were to do what is in the best interest of the city, we would try to maintain whatever control we have here.

2618
04:04:37,194 --> 04:04:49,702
[SPEAKER_11]: If we move to deny the applications, there is a very high chance that this just goes to court and we lose and they are installed as written as applied for.

2619
04:04:51,863 --> 04:04:54,345
[SPEAKER_11]: So my position today,

2620
04:04:55,099 --> 04:05:00,842
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've talked to other people about my position and things like that.

2621
04:05:02,183 --> 04:05:18,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't necessarily have anything against 5G technology and moving in that direction, but I have reservations and none of it has to do with the policy itself or the federal law that we're operating under.

2622
04:05:19,471 --> 04:05:25,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Should overhead wire telephone poles, utility poles be used for wireless towers?

2623
04:05:25,594 --> 04:05:26,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I personally think so?

2624
04:05:26,734 --> 04:05:32,076
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because I want to see overhead wires go underground and I want to see utility poles out of our streetscape.

2625
04:05:32,816 --> 04:05:36,018
[SPEAKER_11]: But that is irrelevant here today.

2626
04:05:37,798 --> 04:05:43,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, what is irrelevant here today is the health impacts to our residents.

2627
04:05:43,500 --> 04:05:44,741
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is unfortunate.

2628
04:05:45,361 --> 04:05:46,862
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a situation wherein, again,

2629
04:05:47,893 --> 04:06:00,361
[SPEAKER_11]: To the extent that we can sort of control what happens here, I am of the belief that granting with conditions retains the most control here from the city's standpoint.

2630
04:06:01,782 --> 04:06:04,284
[SPEAKER_11]: It allows us to condition the approval.

2631
04:06:07,009 --> 04:06:13,614
[SPEAKER_11]: With that said, I do believe there's probably more science to be done, and I believe that more science will be done.

2632
04:06:13,694 --> 04:06:21,360
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are scientists who are legitimate, who think that wireless technology is detrimental to our health.

2633
04:06:21,721 --> 04:06:27,045
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know there are a lot of people who believe that as well, whether it's correct or not.

2634
04:06:28,626 --> 04:06:36,112
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a situation that this committee is in, and it's unfortunate.

2635
04:06:37,625 --> 04:06:50,494
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanna be clear that my vote to grant with conditions, which is what I intend to do, does not mean that I am in agreement with how this is all happening.

2636
04:06:50,795 --> 04:06:52,056
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not at all.

2637
04:06:53,176 --> 04:07:04,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I am of the opinion that the best way for the city to maintain what absolutely minuscule control it has in this situation is to grant these locations with conditions.

2638
04:07:06,052 --> 04:07:13,274
[SPEAKER_11]: With that said, I'm looking for a motion from the committee to move forward on 287 Main Street.

2639
04:07:17,016 --> 04:07:23,358
[SPEAKER_37]: I make a motion that we grant 287 Main Street with the standing conditions we just voted to adopt.

2640
04:07:26,339 --> 04:07:26,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I hear a second?

2641
04:07:26,939 --> 04:07:30,520
[SPEAKER_15]: I second.

2642
04:07:33,301 --> 04:07:34,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I will do a roll call vote.

2643
04:07:35,142 --> 04:07:35,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul?

2644
04:07:36,304 --> 04:07:36,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2645
04:07:38,005 --> 04:07:38,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia.

2646
04:07:38,425 --> 04:07:39,626
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

2647
04:07:40,906 --> 04:07:41,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Marianne.

2648
04:07:47,869 --> 04:07:48,150
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2649
04:07:50,951 --> 04:07:51,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that was a no.

2650
04:07:52,472 --> 04:07:52,992
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a no.

2651
04:07:53,012 --> 04:07:54,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I vote yes.

2652
04:07:54,613 --> 04:08:02,636
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so the next one is 24 Wareham Street.

2653
04:08:04,432 --> 04:08:14,338
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could zoom in on the location, on the map, and we'll discuss among the committee, and then we'll go to public comment.

2654
04:08:15,558 --> 04:08:18,080
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, Tim, I didn't get that street address, I apologize.

2655
04:08:18,420 --> 04:08:23,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, 24 Wareham Street, W-A-R-E-H-A-M, application 36.

2656
04:08:23,763 --> 04:08:27,585
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll get the poll number.

2657
04:08:46,699 --> 04:08:48,240
[SPEAKER_11]: The poll number is 664.

2658
04:08:48,620 --> 04:09:00,290
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, this 24 Wareham Street, let me get my comments on this one.

2659
04:09:09,394 --> 04:09:17,417
[SPEAKER_11]: My comments on this one were 55 feet away from two, three-story residential buildings.

2660
04:09:21,618 --> 04:09:23,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Any comments, discussions from the committee?

2661
04:09:23,519 --> 04:09:33,003
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we'll go into public.

2662
04:09:33,123 --> 04:09:33,683
[SPEAKER_37]: Excuse me.

2663
04:09:33,703 --> 04:09:34,243
[SPEAKER_37]: Go ahead.

2664
04:09:35,183 --> 04:09:36,104
[SPEAKER_37]: One thing on that one.

2665
04:09:38,021 --> 04:09:39,602
[SPEAKER_37]: I just looked at the application online.

2666
04:09:39,622 --> 04:09:41,163
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm just looking at the aerial view.

2667
04:09:42,483 --> 04:09:46,265
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, the installation looks like it's right under a big tree.

2668
04:09:46,385 --> 04:09:52,107
[SPEAKER_37]: And the installation of this antenna going to require any pruning or cutting back of any trees in the area?

2669
04:09:52,307 --> 04:09:53,788
[SPEAKER_37]: Did you notice that, Tim?

2670
04:10:06,539 --> 04:10:07,319
[SPEAKER_38]: I can speak to that.

2671
04:10:07,359 --> 04:10:09,580
[SPEAKER_38]: We don't plan to do any tree trimming at this location.

2672
04:10:10,981 --> 04:10:19,084
[SPEAKER_37]: OK.

2673
04:10:19,424 --> 04:10:32,809
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that I did notice, Paul, going through these, is that these overhead wire paths tend to be trimmed out anyway by the utility companies.

2674
04:10:33,109 --> 04:10:34,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're at that place.

2675
04:10:35,523 --> 04:10:38,725
[SPEAKER_11]: where it does get trimmed by the overhead wire companies.

2676
04:10:40,506 --> 04:10:40,706
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

2677
04:10:40,726 --> 04:10:41,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, good.

2678
04:10:41,506 --> 04:10:50,931
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so we can open up to public comment, Amanda.

2679
04:10:53,092 --> 04:10:55,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, so Councilor Marks.

2680
04:10:58,975 --> 04:10:59,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Councilor Marks.

2681
04:11:02,915 --> 04:11:03,716
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

2682
04:11:04,176 --> 04:11:14,481
[SPEAKER_25]: I first would like to state that, as was stated earlier by some of the committee members, we're going a little over four hours now on a public hearing.

2683
04:11:15,162 --> 04:11:22,525
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think it's really doing the community disservice to proceed any further with a hearing that's already lasted four hours.

2684
04:11:23,346 --> 04:11:30,890
[SPEAKER_25]: And going through these piece by piece, potentially could have someone on the line for over five hours.

2685
04:11:31,542 --> 04:11:34,804
[SPEAKER_25]: which to me is unacceptable, and that's my own opinion.

2686
04:11:35,484 --> 04:11:46,931
[SPEAKER_25]: My question I have is regarding, and I asked this earlier and didn't get a response, was regarding the interim policy and the guidelines that talk about minimum setbacks.

2687
04:11:47,891 --> 04:11:51,894
[SPEAKER_25]: And I still have not received an answer regarding minimum setback guidelines.

2688
04:11:52,981 --> 04:11:54,361
[SPEAKER_25]: Have they not been established?

2689
04:11:54,801 --> 04:11:55,962
[SPEAKER_25]: Will they be established?

2690
04:11:56,402 --> 04:12:03,543
[SPEAKER_25]: What are we using for principles regarding setbacks from dwellings in parks and so forth?

2691
04:12:05,404 --> 04:12:06,784
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe that they were established.

2692
04:12:08,044 --> 04:12:12,945
[SPEAKER_11]: So they are mentioned in the policy that they can be established, but they weren't ever established.

2693
04:12:13,506 --> 04:12:19,687
[SPEAKER_25]: So the committee's moving ahead without establishing guidelines that the interim policy states

2694
04:12:20,456 --> 04:12:30,258
[SPEAKER_25]: there will be guidelines, or at least states, guidelines on structure height, lengths, and minimum setback rules for dwellings, parks, and playgrounds.

2695
04:12:30,738 --> 04:12:43,381
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're going ahead approving without, in my opinion, some of the major concerns we heard from residents was regarding the proximity of the 5G outlets to their property.

2696
04:12:44,441 --> 04:12:46,722
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm not quite sure how we move forward

2697
04:12:47,085 --> 04:12:51,710
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not quite sure what the rush to judgment tonight is, to be quite honest with you.

2698
04:12:52,050 --> 04:12:55,894
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, naturally, Verizon wants to get this over as quick as humanly possible.

2699
04:12:56,374 --> 04:13:04,543
[SPEAKER_25]: But in my opinion, you held a public hearing now, you should at least allow for several days after the public hearing for more public comment.

2700
04:13:05,143 --> 04:13:08,584
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're disregarding the community by not doing so.

2701
04:13:08,904 --> 04:13:16,146
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been involved with hundreds of public hearings, and that's no exaggeration, in the city of Meffitt over 26 years.

2702
04:13:16,726 --> 04:13:19,967
[SPEAKER_25]: And I've never seen a public hearing run this way, to be quite frank.

2703
04:13:20,208 --> 04:13:22,088
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's not a reflection of you, Mr. Chairman.

2704
04:13:22,388 --> 04:13:28,330
[SPEAKER_25]: I understand this is a tough task, but to put 44 applicants on one public hearing

2705
04:13:28,710 --> 04:13:36,875
[SPEAKER_25]: and then also have a presentation like we did earlier, I think it's too much for one public hearing and it doesn't allow for additional public input.

2706
04:13:37,276 --> 04:13:52,566
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would respectfully ask the committee to find out what the setbacks, maybe the committee has to meet again and talk about the setback guidelines and other guidelines within this before they move and start approving these one at a time.

2707
04:13:52,866 --> 04:13:54,587
[SPEAKER_25]: And I would respectfully ask that Mr. Chair.

2708
04:13:56,235 --> 04:14:04,139
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding is that the committee doesn't have the ability to amend the policy.

2709
04:14:04,360 --> 04:14:06,441
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to operate under the policy.

2710
04:14:06,921 --> 04:14:14,585
[SPEAKER_11]: And Robin, you can correct me if I'm wrong, we're well beyond the shot clocks established by federal law in this situation.

2711
04:14:18,292 --> 04:14:23,313
[SPEAKER_25]: With all due respect, we've been in a pandemic for the past, you know, 15 months.

2712
04:14:24,454 --> 04:14:27,794
[SPEAKER_25]: So, you know, the shot clocks, in my opinion, go out the window.

2713
04:14:29,195 --> 04:14:31,595
[SPEAKER_20]: I can comment on maybe on a different aspect of this.

2714
04:14:31,655 --> 04:14:42,138
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's that the FCC's order, the federal regulation, as far as aesthetic requirements go, does require that they be published in advance in order to apply to a particular application.

2715
04:14:42,618 --> 04:14:47,659
[SPEAKER_20]: So while it may make sense to adopt additional requirements for the future,

2716
04:14:48,649 --> 04:14:52,352
[SPEAKER_20]: the what's in place now is what should be applied to these applications.

2717
04:14:54,274 --> 04:14:57,436
[SPEAKER_25]: So you can't amend policy, but you can grant waivers.

2718
04:14:58,717 --> 04:15:01,780
[SPEAKER_20]: You can amend the policy for the future, yes.

2719
04:15:03,021 --> 04:15:09,707
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, but the current interim policy states that there'll be guidelines on minimum setback rules.

2720
04:15:10,767 --> 04:15:11,828
[SPEAKER_25]: Where are those guidelines?

2721
04:15:13,350 --> 04:15:14,831
[SPEAKER_25]: Am I reading this incorrectly?

2722
04:15:17,087 --> 04:15:18,710
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm curious to read the guidelines.

2723
04:15:22,757 --> 04:15:23,217
[SPEAKER_11]: It's item J, 1J.

2724
04:15:28,427 --> 04:15:32,668
[SPEAKER_11]: The seat of Medford is particularly sensitive to the visual impacts of small cell wireless infrastructures.

2725
04:15:33,128 --> 04:15:54,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Therefore it shall implement and impose on an interim basis, reasonable aesthetic standards pertaining to the size of the antenna, the equipment box and or related cabling, placement of equipment on support structures, establishing flush mounting requirements and spacing requirements and aesthetic measures such as paint matching or design matching for small wireless facilities in specific areas.

2726
04:15:55,413 --> 04:16:07,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Camouflage and other concealment methods and for residential areas guidelines on structure heights and lengths and minimum setback rules from dwellings parks or playgrounds or similar recreation areas.

2727
04:16:08,320 --> 04:16:12,603
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, after that it says what the aesthetic requirements are.

2728
04:16:14,009 --> 04:16:25,234
[SPEAKER_11]: right now, I believe that J section is there to allow the policy to be changed in those arenas in the future, in those categories in the future.

2729
04:16:26,394 --> 04:16:28,175
[SPEAKER_11]: That is my understanding of it.

2730
04:16:28,635 --> 04:16:32,137
[SPEAKER_25]: So you're not saying the committee has the ability to create these guidelines?

2731
04:16:33,902 --> 04:16:37,404
[SPEAKER_11]: The only policy creator in the city, I believe, is the mayor.

2732
04:16:37,625 --> 04:16:39,426
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not stating creating policy.

2733
04:16:39,866 --> 04:16:41,447
[SPEAKER_25]: It clearly states guidelines.

2734
04:16:41,867 --> 04:16:52,715
[SPEAKER_25]: And as a committee that's appointed by the mayor, I would believe, and the attorney can correct me from KP Law, that your board would have the ability to set guidelines.

2735
04:16:56,057 --> 04:16:57,538
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not a policy change.

2736
04:16:57,958 --> 04:17:00,040
[SPEAKER_25]: It's requesting guidelines.

2737
04:17:02,704 --> 04:17:06,468
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think we would need to look into that issue some more.

2738
04:17:06,488 --> 04:17:10,173
[SPEAKER_20]: It does say the city of Medford shall implement and impose.

2739
04:17:11,294 --> 04:17:17,281
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't know, as I sit here today, that that means this committee or some other actor on behalf of the city.

2740
04:17:18,802 --> 04:17:22,667
[SPEAKER_20]: But in any event, you have to apply

2741
04:17:23,463 --> 04:17:25,064
[SPEAKER_20]: the federal law to these applications.

2742
04:17:25,084 --> 04:17:27,487
[SPEAKER_20]: The federal law says you can only apply what was published in advance.

2743
04:17:27,507 --> 04:17:30,329
[SPEAKER_20]: The applicant needs to know what's expected of them in advance.

2744
04:17:30,409 --> 04:17:36,855
[SPEAKER_20]: So even if guidelines were published tomorrow, they would not, in my opinion, be applicable to these applications.

2745
04:17:36,915 --> 04:17:50,287
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's exactly the reason why I'm asking not to rush to judgment tonight and have this committee, the small cell committee, do their due diligence in their homework and create the guidelines that are requested under the interim policy

2746
04:17:50,888 --> 04:17:54,610
[SPEAKER_25]: regarding setbacks, which is a major concern for area residents.

2747
04:17:55,351 --> 04:18:10,480
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, I guess the point I'm trying to make is if additional guidelines were enacted tomorrow, regardless of how they're enacted, they still would not apply, in my opinion, to these applications.

2748
04:18:12,342 --> 04:18:14,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I would respectfully disagree with that.

2749
04:18:14,703 --> 04:18:16,084
[SPEAKER_25]: I would respectfully disagree with that.

2750
04:18:22,537 --> 04:18:24,519
[SPEAKER_25]: Do we still have our city solicitor on the phone?

2751
04:18:32,786 --> 04:18:33,487
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

2752
04:18:33,827 --> 04:18:34,168
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

2753
04:18:34,228 --> 04:18:35,769
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you mean me or did you mean Kim?

2754
04:18:37,230 --> 04:18:38,171
[SPEAKER_25]: Our city solicitor.

2755
04:18:38,692 --> 04:18:38,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2756
04:18:41,234 --> 04:18:43,056
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that she is here.

2757
04:18:50,606 --> 04:18:57,950
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Chair, I'm very concerned that we're gonna be approving these applications now one at a time at a late hour.

2758
04:18:58,290 --> 04:19:08,296
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm equally concerned that this body is not addressing the guidelines for setbacks that are part of the interim policy.

2759
04:19:09,026 --> 04:19:13,273
[SPEAKER_25]: And whether or not I understand what the attorney stating that would have no bearing on tonight.

2760
04:19:13,594 --> 04:19:16,198
[SPEAKER_25]: What I'm respectfully asking is that we don't vote tonight.

2761
04:19:16,719 --> 04:19:18,582
[SPEAKER_25]: And maybe we have to come back at another time.

2762
04:19:19,023 --> 04:19:23,170
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it was brought up by KP law.

2763
04:19:23,673 --> 04:19:32,918
[SPEAKER_25]: some months ago through the city administration that they didn't even think the interim policy that was created by the mayor was something that we should be working off of.

2764
04:19:33,398 --> 04:19:37,221
[SPEAKER_25]: And they asked that the city council create an ordinance to govern this.

2765
04:19:37,761 --> 04:19:42,804
[SPEAKER_25]: So KP law to me, you know, is jumping around on the issue to be quite frank.

2766
04:19:43,444 --> 04:19:48,907
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, I really believe this requires more attention than it's receiving tonight.

2767
04:19:52,956 --> 04:19:59,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we have received advisement throughout this and we've discussed this since the beginning about the policy.

2768
04:19:59,462 --> 04:20:01,885
[SPEAKER_11]: It was changed once.

2769
04:20:02,926 --> 04:20:05,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand you're focusing in on guidelines.

2770
04:20:07,790 --> 04:20:13,155
[SPEAKER_11]: I was not aware that this committee is tasked with creating those guidelines.

2771
04:20:17,569 --> 04:20:19,831
[SPEAKER_11]: So like Robin said, we can look into it.

2772
04:20:19,991 --> 04:20:22,993
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm operating under the advisement that I've received.

2773
04:20:26,915 --> 04:20:31,418
[SPEAKER_11]: And as far as the hour, I agree with you.

2774
04:20:31,538 --> 04:20:34,821
[SPEAKER_11]: We're quite late into the hour here.

2775
04:20:36,562 --> 04:20:42,446
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding is that this could be dealt with in ordinance as well.

2776
04:20:43,426 --> 04:20:46,408
[SPEAKER_11]: It's another avenue to deal with

2777
04:20:47,583 --> 04:20:50,706
[SPEAKER_11]: this particular situation with this small cell antennas.

2778
04:20:53,107 --> 04:20:57,011
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, it is 1030.

2779
04:20:57,051 --> 04:21:08,940
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to ask Verizon again if they're open to continuing the hearing for a date certain in two weeks, I guess.

2780
04:21:10,374 --> 04:21:13,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, Mr Chair, I think that we could continue.

2781
04:21:13,396 --> 04:21:14,996
[SPEAKER_16]: I've looked at the city's calendar.

2782
04:21:15,256 --> 04:21:17,718
[SPEAKER_16]: We do not have to advertise in the newspaper.

2783
04:21:17,778 --> 04:21:22,100
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to continue to a certain and we need to post on the city's website.

2784
04:21:22,940 --> 04:21:26,182
[SPEAKER_16]: We do not need to re notify a butters and Robin.

2785
04:21:26,242 --> 04:21:37,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct me if I've gotten any of that wrong, which would mean that we could meet and I've looked at the city's wet calendar next Thursday, which is a week from tomorrow is

2786
04:21:39,184 --> 04:21:44,667
[SPEAKER_16]: has nothing that conflicts of a nature that would be inappropriate in my opinion.

2787
04:21:45,207 --> 04:21:50,689
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a community preservation committee public hearing at 6.30.

2788
04:21:52,510 --> 04:22:01,054
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to answer your question, yes, if you continue to a time, place and date certain, then you do not need to re-notice anything.

2789
04:22:01,074 --> 04:22:03,355
[SPEAKER_20]: You can maintain the continuity of your public notices.

2790
04:22:04,556 --> 04:22:06,497
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we would as a courtesy,

2791
04:22:07,281 --> 04:22:22,650
[SPEAKER_16]: posted on the website, we would post it in our regular places, but we don't have to put it in a newspaper, which is actually what for us to publicize in a newspaper, we need two weeks because of the timing of the notices in the papers.

2792
04:22:23,331 --> 04:22:26,413
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do the roll call again.

2793
04:22:27,433 --> 04:22:34,638
[SPEAKER_20]: And obviously the open meeting law agenda requirements and posting will apply as well.

2794
04:22:34,658 --> 04:22:36,399
[SPEAKER_16]: 48 hours notice and through our

2795
04:22:37,223 --> 04:22:38,744
[SPEAKER_16]: methods for any public meeting.

2796
04:22:39,044 --> 04:22:39,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

2797
04:22:42,005 --> 04:22:48,049
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's where I would suggest next Thursday night, April 8th.

2798
04:22:50,130 --> 04:22:57,313
[SPEAKER_37]: Having no significant- Miriam and I have a CAC committee meeting that night on the 8th.

2799
04:22:57,333 --> 04:22:57,854
[SPEAKER_16]: At five?

2800
04:22:58,414 --> 04:22:58,774
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2801
04:22:58,814 --> 04:22:59,875
[SPEAKER_16]: That meeting's at five?

2802
04:23:01,576 --> 04:23:02,336
[SPEAKER_37]: Five o'clock, yeah.

2803
04:23:05,948 --> 04:23:07,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'd prefer not to.

2804
04:23:09,389 --> 04:23:16,970
[SPEAKER_16]: I will tell you that Wednesday night is a very large community event community, the community.

2805
04:23:17,310 --> 04:23:18,750
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, I'm involved in that.

2806
04:23:20,391 --> 04:23:30,652
[SPEAKER_16]: What time do you think on Thursday was Tuesday, Thursday, Tuesday is city council I, I have any of the whole at.

2807
04:23:32,153 --> 04:23:33,593
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'll get that too.

2808
04:23:36,056 --> 04:23:42,482
[SPEAKER_18]: So what time on Thursday would you be proposing this meeting?

2809
04:23:42,502 --> 04:23:42,482
30.

2810
04:23:43,643 --> 04:23:44,083
[SPEAKER_18]: What time?

2811
04:23:44,103 --> 04:23:44,083
6.30.

2812
04:23:45,184 --> 04:23:49,007
[SPEAKER_37]: What do we got, Paul, five?

2813
04:23:49,888 --> 04:23:53,931
[SPEAKER_37]: We got five, maybe we can get out of it by 6.30.

2814
04:23:54,752 --> 04:23:56,453
[SPEAKER_16]: You wanna make, we could say seven.

2815
04:23:58,055 --> 04:23:59,536
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'd prefer 6.30.

2816
04:24:00,397 --> 04:24:02,619
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what's on the schedule for the CAC meeting.

2817
04:24:03,159 --> 04:24:03,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Better for others.

2818
04:24:19,402 --> 04:24:28,710
[SPEAKER_16]: Just because I don't, I do agree that it's, if we're going to take public comments on these and if we're going to think thoughtfully about each one of them, I think we're all hitting our limits.

2819
04:24:28,730 --> 04:24:30,872
[SPEAKER_16]: It's irrational.

2820
04:24:30,892 --> 04:24:34,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, I agree.

2821
04:24:35,315 --> 04:24:37,677
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should continue it to a date certain.

2822
04:24:37,697 --> 04:24:39,259
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's what I would like to do.

2823
04:24:39,279 --> 04:24:42,682
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, it's getting late and I'm running out of time.

2824
04:24:43,382 --> 04:24:43,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

2825
04:24:43,662 --> 04:24:45,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we put some additional guidelines?

2826
04:24:45,444 --> 04:24:46,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Like we would not have,

2827
04:24:47,945 --> 04:24:55,228
[SPEAKER_16]: we would take public comment on individual locations, but not general public comment, repeating the comments for tonight.

2828
04:24:56,809 --> 04:24:58,369
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd wanna pick up right where we left off.

2829
04:24:58,609 --> 04:24:59,930
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd wanna pick up right where we left off.

2830
04:25:00,690 --> 04:25:13,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, we can put guidelines around that, Robin, that we'll take public comment on individuals, but the general comments and concerns that were heard tonight, people can't say, well, I didn't speak that portion of the meeting.

2831
04:25:14,225 --> 04:25:26,374
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, the public comment on the applications is open, but certainly Tim can request that folks, you know, who've already had an opportunity to speak, don't repeat themselves and that, you know, they limit it.

2832
04:25:26,454 --> 04:25:32,958
[SPEAKER_20]: But I mean, you know, if somebody couldn't make the first meeting and really just had a comment, you probably want to just take it.

2833
04:25:33,199 --> 04:25:34,900
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't, it's either open or closed, so.

2834
04:25:35,700 --> 04:25:36,641
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I would do.

2835
04:25:36,721 --> 04:25:43,206
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say if there are any, anyone that didn't comment last time that has a comment to make,

2836
04:25:43,773 --> 04:25:52,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's start with that and try to limit it and because that is what took up the bulk of our time tonight, which, which is, which is fine.

2837
04:25:54,722 --> 04:26:00,687
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I think just the understanding that we are through that portion of the agenda is important.

2838
04:26:02,102 --> 04:26:15,768
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can look into questions that Councilor Marks brought up, but I'm fairly certain where we stand and what we're allowed to do on this after thorough discussions on this.

2839
04:26:16,048 --> 04:26:20,210
[SPEAKER_11]: So while I do appreciate Councilor Marks' insight, it is always valuable.

2840
04:26:20,230 --> 04:26:28,413
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure it changes what we're tasked and set out to do at the moment, and that may be seen as unfortunate.

2841
04:26:29,468 --> 04:26:41,998
[SPEAKER_18]: And while I do appreciate everyone's comments and feelings about health impacts and effects, it's pretty clear that we can't evaluate based on that.

2842
04:26:42,138 --> 04:26:52,847
[SPEAKER_18]: So those comments, while incredibly valuable and incredibly important, can't impact our vote.

2843
04:26:53,107 --> 04:26:55,269
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think going forward,

2844
04:26:56,508 --> 04:27:03,032
[SPEAKER_18]: to make that perfectly clear to people while we wanna hear their opinions, we can act on them.

2845
04:27:03,392 --> 04:27:04,753
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's important as well.

2846
04:27:04,773 --> 04:27:11,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Because the majority of the comments tonight were on the health impacts and the concerns.

2847
04:27:12,158 --> 04:27:17,321
[SPEAKER_18]: And while those are extremely genuine, we can't do anything.

2848
04:27:17,682 --> 04:27:22,805
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that needs to be made really clear.

2849
04:27:23,710 --> 04:27:28,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have an availability for Thursday the 8th where all of us are available?

2850
04:27:29,074 --> 04:27:31,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Or did I hear 6.30 or 7 or something like that?

2851
04:27:33,236 --> 04:27:33,876
[SPEAKER_20]: I can do that.

2852
04:27:34,057 --> 04:27:35,998
[SPEAKER_20]: You might want to check Verizon's availability.

2853
04:27:36,578 --> 04:27:38,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to check us first to see if.

2854
04:27:40,180 --> 04:27:45,684
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, Tim, I think Marianne and I could probably make a 6.30 if you want, if that's OK with everybody else.

2855
04:27:46,264 --> 04:27:48,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we have a 5, so we should be out by 6.30.

2856
04:27:48,345 --> 04:27:50,367
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

2857
04:27:51,147 --> 04:27:51,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Alicia?

2858
04:27:52,248 --> 04:27:52,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2859
04:27:53,558 --> 04:27:53,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2860
04:27:55,419 --> 04:28:05,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to be clear with the committee, we would pick up where we left off with a short option for public comment at the beginning for folks who didn't have a chance to speak tonight.

2861
04:28:06,702 --> 04:28:10,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, now with all that said, Verizon has been listening to what we've been saying, obviously.

2862
04:28:11,023 --> 04:28:13,824
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that we've talked about 11 o'clock.

2863
04:28:14,705 --> 04:28:15,685
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 1030 now.

2864
04:28:15,705 --> 04:28:19,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you guys okay with

2865
04:28:20,725 --> 04:28:26,647
[SPEAKER_11]: continuing this on April 8th at 630, starting where we left off?

2866
04:28:27,847 --> 04:28:30,407
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, Mr. Chairman, we can make it on April 8th.

2867
04:28:30,467 --> 04:28:40,950
[SPEAKER_27]: I do think, you know, it's unfortunate that the spirit of trying to get through this by 11 was compromised and there was a lot of repeated discussion.

2868
04:28:40,970 --> 04:28:48,272
[SPEAKER_27]: I would hope that the next time that there is not a general public comment period at the beginning, everyone who wanted to comment could have commented this evening.

2869
04:28:48,788 --> 04:28:57,052
[SPEAKER_27]: The portion of the hearing we're on is the portion with the individual applications, which you were starting to move through pretty quickly until we got sidetracked.

2870
04:28:58,893 --> 04:29:00,433
[SPEAKER_27]: Verizon wants to wrap this up.

2871
04:29:01,234 --> 04:29:03,035
[SPEAKER_27]: We've delayed the shot clock now.

2872
04:29:03,895 --> 04:29:09,598
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not giving you an extension, but it's right now about eight months after the shot clock expired.

2873
04:29:09,638 --> 04:29:11,899
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'd really like to get this moving.

2874
04:29:11,959 --> 04:29:12,299
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2875
04:29:13,837 --> 04:29:20,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I actually agree with them in that I'm not in fan of taking public general public comment.

2876
04:29:20,363 --> 04:29:25,387
[SPEAKER_16]: I see that there are people now with their hands raised, and I am totally comfortable.

2877
04:29:25,427 --> 04:29:28,350
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to take public comment on the individual locations.

2878
04:29:28,770 --> 04:29:36,357
[SPEAKER_16]: But if this was the Conservation Commission, they would not accept comment on things that they have no say over, and they would cut it off.

2879
04:29:36,938 --> 04:29:41,060
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel like we've really given people a chance to express their concerns on this.

2880
04:29:41,100 --> 04:29:44,462
[SPEAKER_16]: They can continue to send us emails to the email address about it.

2881
04:29:46,523 --> 04:29:47,584
[SPEAKER_16]: But I am honestly concerned.

2882
04:29:47,604 --> 04:29:50,625
[SPEAKER_18]: If we have no say over it, it doesn't make it.

2883
04:29:51,966 --> 04:30:04,213
[SPEAKER_16]: I am honestly concerned that there would be residents, people, let's just say people that want this to not happen and would make an effort to

2884
04:30:04,994 --> 04:30:07,140
[SPEAKER_16]: recruit people to come talk just to delay it.

2885
04:30:07,743 --> 04:30:09,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we are in the agenda.

2886
04:30:09,244 --> 04:30:15,009
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we can make it clear that we are on item, whatever we are on in the agenda, we aren't a specific item.

2887
04:30:15,429 --> 04:30:22,454
[SPEAKER_11]: And the idea of continuing the hearing is just to pick up where we left off, because we all want to go to bed and I can barely function and other people can barely function.

2888
04:30:22,474 --> 04:30:27,478
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really the reason, you know, like I said, I don't know about you guys, but I wake up at four every day.

2889
04:30:27,679 --> 04:30:31,001
[SPEAKER_11]: So this to me is way late, which is fine.

2890
04:30:31,341 --> 04:30:35,945
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that public comment period exactly was what you stated, Alicia was that

2891
04:30:36,445 --> 04:30:40,488
[SPEAKER_11]: and Verizon, the opportunity for folks to come, that was that.

2892
04:30:40,528 --> 04:30:42,489
[SPEAKER_11]: We're on time, the agenda.

2893
04:30:42,849 --> 04:30:54,737
[SPEAKER_11]: If there are specific locations that the public would like to speak, then yes, we should have a period where folks can speak on the site-specific locations and go from there.

2894
04:30:55,778 --> 04:31:01,601
[SPEAKER_11]: If we hit that fresh-minded, we could probably run through them pretty quickly and be done with it.

2895
04:31:02,602 --> 04:31:07,784
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think Tim can manage the scope of public comment as the chair of the meeting at the next meeting.

2896
04:31:08,464 --> 04:31:09,124
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so, yeah.

2897
04:31:09,144 --> 04:31:22,448
[SPEAKER_11]: And tonight that to let everybody speak was designed into the agenda because we realized that there is a lot of public interest in this topic, which was why it was done that way.

2898
04:31:23,488 --> 04:31:28,550
[SPEAKER_20]: And folks will have an opportunity on site specific discussion to make their comments.

2899
04:31:29,387 --> 04:31:29,767
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

2900
04:31:30,067 --> 04:31:30,428
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

2901
04:31:30,548 --> 04:31:31,628
[SPEAKER_11]: And the agenda is posted.

2902
04:31:31,648 --> 04:31:32,689
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be reposted again.

2903
04:31:32,709 --> 04:31:35,130
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll do a roll call.

2904
04:31:37,111 --> 04:31:42,253
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have a date certain, April 8th, 630.

2905
04:31:43,794 --> 04:31:45,635
[SPEAKER_11]: And do I have a motion from the committee?

2906
04:31:46,235 --> 04:31:47,996
[SPEAKER_20]: And just to clarify, that'll be a remote meeting.

2907
04:31:48,016 --> 04:31:51,198
[SPEAKER_20]: So you'll be publishing and posting the call and information.

2908
04:31:52,198 --> 04:31:52,678
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

2909
04:31:53,098 --> 04:31:53,439
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

2910
04:31:53,859 --> 04:31:54,139
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

2911
04:31:54,179 --> 04:31:55,320
[SPEAKER_20]: Just as far as location goes.

2912
04:31:56,100 --> 04:31:56,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2913
04:31:56,829 --> 04:32:02,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, all the open meeting laws will be adhered to, all the notifications that we need to do, posting the agenda, all that good stuff.

2914
04:32:03,033 --> 04:32:12,319
[SPEAKER_16]: The location will be on the Zoom link, will be on the city's website under the events calendar, just like tonight, for the record.

2915
04:32:13,319 --> 04:32:13,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2916
04:32:14,480 --> 04:32:14,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

2917
04:32:16,261 --> 04:32:18,763
[SPEAKER_11]: So do I hear a motion to continue?

2918
04:32:21,054 --> 04:32:25,456
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll make a motion to continue to April 8th at 6.30.

2919
04:32:25,936 --> 04:32:30,258
[SPEAKER_20]: And just to be clear, we're continuing all of the open applications that one was acted on.

2920
04:32:31,138 --> 04:32:33,019
[SPEAKER_11]: One was acted on, yep.

2921
04:32:33,299 --> 04:32:34,159
[SPEAKER_11]: All the open ones, yep.

2922
04:32:34,539 --> 04:32:36,500
[SPEAKER_20]: All of the other 43 open applications.

2923
04:32:37,040 --> 04:32:38,041
[SPEAKER_11]: You got it, you got it.

2924
04:32:38,121 --> 04:32:41,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And we did also vote on our slate of standard conditions, too.

2925
04:32:41,982 --> 04:32:43,023
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have that.

2926
04:32:43,263 --> 04:32:44,403
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have made progress tonight.

2927
04:32:44,643 --> 04:32:47,384
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's not forget, we made some progress.

2928
04:32:49,968 --> 04:32:54,530
[SPEAKER_11]: We will reconvene on the 8th and continue the agenda.

2929
04:32:55,171 --> 04:32:56,491
[SPEAKER_20]: You will need a vote on this, though.

2930
04:32:56,972 --> 04:32:57,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

2931
04:32:57,372 --> 04:32:58,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I need a second.

2932
04:32:58,452 --> 04:32:59,193
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't hear a second.

2933
04:32:59,213 --> 04:32:59,653
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, sorry.

2934
04:32:59,873 --> 04:33:01,294
[SPEAKER_20]: I was getting ahead of things.

2935
04:33:01,874 --> 04:33:02,715
[SPEAKER_11]: That's OK.

2936
04:33:02,775 --> 04:33:04,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Robin, you and I together, we got this.

2937
04:33:05,676 --> 04:33:07,137
[SPEAKER_11]: If I miss it, you catch it.

2938
04:33:08,397 --> 04:33:09,058
[SPEAKER_11]: So I need a second.

2939
04:33:09,138 --> 04:33:09,378
[SPEAKER_11]: A second.

2940
04:33:09,818 --> 04:33:10,358
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll second.

2941
04:33:10,959 --> 04:33:12,279
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, second from Mary Ann.

2942
04:33:13,020 --> 04:33:13,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul?

2943
04:33:14,361 --> 04:33:14,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2944
04:33:15,461 --> 04:33:15,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Alicia?

2945
04:33:15,861 --> 04:33:16,762
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2946
04:33:17,502 --> 04:33:17,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary Ann?

2947
04:33:18,783 --> 04:33:18,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2948
04:33:19,885 --> 04:33:21,047
[SPEAKER_11]: And me, yes.

2949
04:33:22,929 --> 04:33:23,169
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2950
04:33:23,269 --> 04:33:24,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, everybody.

2951
04:33:25,132 --> 04:33:29,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will see you on the 8th at 630, right here on Zoom.

2952
04:33:31,941 --> 04:33:32,622
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you all.

2953
04:33:32,942 --> 04:33:33,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

2954
04:33:33,923 --> 04:33:35,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being patient, everybody.

2955
04:33:35,465 --> 04:33:36,807
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, Verizon, for being patient.
