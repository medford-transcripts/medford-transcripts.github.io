1
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,906
all recommended by the various department heads.

2
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:11,487
Chair recognizes Councilor Caravaglio for a recommendation.

3
00:00:11,987 --> 00:00:12,827
Thank you, Mr. President.

4
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,448
Mr. President, I have reviewed the papers and they all appear to be in order.

5
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:24,030
And if the people could come to please present yourself and state your name and address for the record.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,550
Are you the petitioner?

7
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:31,650
Yes, my name is Simone Pachinko and I live in 23 Bowdoin Street, Bedford.

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,991
And I represent Wellington, Switzerland.

9
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:40,734
Mr. President, all papers seem to be in order and I recommend approval.

10
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:45,396
And I thank the young lady for having the faith to open a business in our community.

11
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:46,877
Thank you.

12
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:47,824
I agree.

13
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:53,386
So on the motion of Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

14
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:54,606
All those opposed?

15
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:55,926
Congratulations.

16
00:00:56,286 --> 00:00:56,967
Thank you very much.

17
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:57,927
License is approved.

18
00:00:58,127 --> 00:00:58,507
Thank you.

19
00:00:59,147 --> 00:01:16,612
Also before us, 16-353, petition for common vigilance license by Amanda Zocco, 35 Village Road, Middleton, Mass., for Fitness Refreshments Incorporated, doing business as Juiced Cafe, 4000 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, on file,

20
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:29,833
business certificate number 077, building department, fire department, police traffic impact, and health department approvals, letters from the treasurer, letter of compliance, tax identification, workman's comp, and the completed

21
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:30,895
Petition.

22
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:34,476
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello, Chairman of the Licensing Committee.

23
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:35,916
Thank you, Mr. President.

24
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:36,296
Thank you.

25
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:37,837
Amanda, this is in Gold's Gym, correct?

26
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:38,277
Correct.

27
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:46,159
Okay, and Mr. President, I reviewed the papers and I find that they all appear to be in order, and I motion for approval.

28
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,500
On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Falco.

29
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,760
All those in favor?

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,860
All those opposed?

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,301
Again, I thank you for having the faith to open in our community.

32
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:55,661
Thank you.

33
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:58,757
Your license is granted, congratulations.

34
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:00,478
Thank you for doing business in Medford.

35
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:01,038
Thank you.

36
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:10,704
While we're under suspension, a communication from the mayor, 16-354, to the honorable president and members of the Medford City Council.

37
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:17,128
On the motion of council and I to revert back to the regular order of business.

38
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:17,849
All those in favor?

39
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,110
All those opposed?

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,230
Motion granted.

41
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:22,392
Regular order of business.

42
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:36,698
Offered by Councilor Caviello be it resolved that the Medford City Council for the second time demand that graffiti on the Bigelow building on the corner of Forrest and Salem Street be removed immediately.

43
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:37,619
Councilor Carvey.

44
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,300
Thank you, Mr. President.

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,343
Mr. President, you know, this is the second time I've asked for that property to be cleaned up.

46
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,705
I mean, Forrest Street is one of the busiest cities in our street.

47
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:49,267
We have events at the Chevalier Auditorium.

48
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:53,090
People are coming out of the, you know, talk about gateway of the city.

49
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,244
If that's the gateway we want people to see, it's not making a very good impression.

50
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:07,749
And Mr. President, and also, if you'll notice that now the building across the street is now being tagged.

51
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,553
It is properties in West Bedford, Central Avenue.

52
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:23,373
I'd like to see our code enforcement officer, if I'm not mistaken, I think in our budget last year was a part-time code enforcement officer, am I correct?

53
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:24,474
Yes, it was, sir.

54
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:31,499
Well, I'd like to see our part-time enforcement officer out on the street and picking up some of these obvious violations.

55
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:39,864
A couple of years ago, Counselor Marks made a motion, 14685, about maybe getting some funding

56
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:45,882
For the city, if the landlord doesn't do it, then we can get out there and pay someone to do it ourselves.

57
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:49,103
And obviously that motion went nowhere.

58
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:56,505
And again, the Forest Street one, it's the gateway to our city.

59
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:00,586
People come down it, you have events at the Chevalier all the time.

60
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:02,147
I mean, it's up on the top there.

61
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,027
I mean, it's by people's windows.

62
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:07,068
I don't know why the people themselves who live in the building haven't complained.

63
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:18,537
But again, if we can get the code officer, postman officer to take care of that property and the other properties and let them go around and it's not demanding that these businesses start cleaning up our city.

64
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:21,820
I'm tired of listening to the people tell us how dirty our city looks.

65
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:24,141
Thank you.

66
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:25,262
Councilor Falco.

67
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:26,803
Thank you, Mr. President.

68
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:31,107
I just want to thank a councilor Cabrillo for bringing this forward a second time.

69
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,968
I think it's important, especially with, uh,

70
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:36,980
people tagging and putting up graffiti that, you know, we're persistent.

71
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,582
We stay on top of this because if you let it go, it just leads to more and more tagging throughout the community.

72
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,123
Councilor Caviello is correct.

73
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:45,564
It's happening throughout the community.

74
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:48,525
I have received a number of calls about specific properties as well.

75
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:54,188
On Spring Street, the corner of Spring and Washington, there's a business that's been tagged.

76
00:04:55,093 --> 00:05:02,478
If you take a look at 7th Canal, which has been a hot topic, that's a building that's been tagged when you come out of the parking lot in West Bedford Square, you'll see that.

77
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:09,142
And also on Riverside Ave, the back of the Sloan building, if you take a look at the second floor,

78
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:13,827
There's graffiti all along the side of that as well.

79
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:18,090
So we really need to make sure that we get on top of this.

80
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,672
It needs to stop, but we need to make sure that it stops right away before it gets out of control.

81
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:27,035
I mean, many people would say it's out of control now, so we really need to jump on top of this.

82
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:29,497
And I thank Councilor Carviello for bringing it forward.

83
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:30,898
Thank you, Councilor.

84
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:31,198
Thank you.

85
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:33,379
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

86
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,380
Thank you, Mr. President.

87
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:44,438
Councilor Caviello is right, I think it was about two years ago I offered a resolution and it was based actually on the city of Somerville.

88
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:58,045
The city of Somerville has a program that the city will have, whether it's a private owner or a public building, they will have the owner sign a waiver form.

89
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:13,158
And if the owner is unable to remove the graffiti based on financial means, the city will step in, as long as there's no liability from this waiver, and they'll remove the graffiti off the side of a home or a building and so forth.

90
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:23,468
I think the one thing that I emphasized two years ago was that if I happen to own a business in the square and someone comes up and tags the whole side of my building,

91
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:31,352
And then the city, the next day, knocks on my door and says, if you don't remove this graffiti, we're going to start fining you.

92
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:33,433
I think that adds insult to injury.

93
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:40,357
The business owner, really, by no fault of their own, was tagged by someone.

94
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:47,582
It's a hardship first of all, and that could be for any property owner too.

95
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:49,302
That could be your house, my house.

96
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:55,204
If someone comes up and spray paints the side of my house, I may not have the means to have that removed immediately.

97
00:06:55,664 --> 00:07:03,306
And I think the city of Somerville offers a great service to the residents of the community to allow that service.

98
00:07:03,846 --> 00:07:13,388
And I believe it was two years ago that I asked that we be able to do our own graffiti removal rather than rely on, right now, the Middlesex County Sheriff's Office

99
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:18,792
does a bulk of our graffiti removal within the community, upon request.

100
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:24,897
So, I'm not sure what the machinery costs, but I think it's worthwhile looking into.

101
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:34,425
It's similar to what Councillor Falco offered not too recently about the plowing of the sidewalks, Councillor Scott Pelley about the Porter Party.

102
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:42,795
and other initiatives in the community that I believe as a community this size, we should be offering, Mr. President.

103
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:55,689
So I would ask my council colleague, if you wouldn't mind amending it, asking through his resolution, once again, that the city administration look into buying the equipment for removal, because again, I want to stress

104
00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:07,802
I'm not in favor of going out and just start fining people that were under the unfortunate circumstance of having graffiti sprayed all over their building or whatever it might be, your home.

105
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:17,305
And I'm more in favor of having the city have an option that frees us from any liability that will remove graffiti.

106
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:24,627
And I agree with Councilor Falco and Councilor, what's your name again?

107
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:38,771
Caviello, Counselor Caviello, Mr. President, that, you know, the more you leave the graffiti out there, it's like the old broken window concept, and it creates more broken windows.

108
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:47,615
So I agree we have to clean it up, but I just don't agree with going after the business owner or the homeowner if they're financially strapped, Mr. President.

109
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:52,951
On the motion by Councilor Caviello, as amended by Councilor Marks.

110
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:54,212
Councilor Caviello.

111
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:59,175
I have no problem changing that for my councilor.

112
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:02,137
You know, it's time we start investing in our community.

113
00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:05,038
This is a relatively small investment.

114
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,581
It's not that it's on a million dollar piece of equipment.

115
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:17,286
So again, I'll support that motion to have the city go out and investigate the purchases of that piece of equipment, Mr. President.

116
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:21,397
On the motion approved by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Falco.

117
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:23,058
Councilor Falco.

118
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:25,659
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

119
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:36,604
If I may offer, if I may amend the resolution to include the properties that I mentioned earlier, that they be addressed as well in addition to the Bigelow building, if we could get the back of the Sloan.

120
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:43,687
As amended by Councilor Falco to include the aforementioned additional addresses, which are, Councilor?

121
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:44,968
Let's see.

122
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:55,543
The Sloan building on Riverside Ave, the backside of the Sloan building, 7 Canal, and I don't have the exact address, but I can get you the address.

123
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:57,805
There's an address on Spring Street as well.

124
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,529
On that motion.

125
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:04,170
Mr. President.

126
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,971
Councillor Knight.

127
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:07,372
Yes, Mr. President.

128
00:10:07,392 --> 00:10:13,376
I'd like to amend the paper to request a report from the C-Click Fix Program relative to the requests to remove graffiti.

129
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:30,652
an additional amendment by Councilor Knight to request an update from the C-Click Fix Program as to the number of graffiti removal reportings that they've had.

130
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:31,312
And locations.

131
00:10:31,612 --> 00:10:33,133
And locations, if you could.

132
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:34,513
Councilor Marks.

133
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:36,454
Thank you, Mr. President.

134
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:41,015
I'll just speak briefly on this because I have a resolution under suspension.

135
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:45,937
However, I did receive an email from a gentleman in the community that just used

136
00:10:46,671 --> 00:11:04,746
the C-Click Fix website and he reported graffiti on the Route 16 West sign and it's spray painted with all black spray paint on it and he used C-Click Fix and he got a response back within minutes

137
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:07,829
saying thank you very much for reporting your issue.

138
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,054
However, that road is operated by DCR and here's the phone number to DCR.

139
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:27,486
And I'm not sure my opinion of C-Click Fix is if you bring an issue to the city, they should work on that issue on behalf of the resident and not just give the resident a phone number to call.

140
00:11:28,347 --> 00:11:30,709
Whether it's a state road or a city road,

141
00:11:31,588 --> 00:11:37,252
That should be the resident alerting the city of what needs to take place and then the city taking action.

142
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:38,673
But I'll speak to that in a later.

143
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:47,980
If you want, we can take these remarks with you on this resolution and we can have you withdraw your motion.

144
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,683
I'd rather keep that, but where Councillor Falco was talking about

145
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:53,744
where it's such in vague form.

146
00:11:54,204 --> 00:12:08,168
Other places that need graffiti removal, I would also add the Route 16 West sign entering Method now says, Ernie Me Moomy, because you can't read it.

147
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:11,330
So I would ask that that be done, Mr. President.

148
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,131
Further resolution by Councilor Falco on the main motion.

149
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:21,633
Speaker at the podium, please know that you are welcome to state your name and address for the record.

150
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,543
Thank you, Gene Martington, Cumming Street.

151
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:25,824
Thank you for bringing this up, Mr. Caraviello.

152
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:29,567
And I would just like to add that this is, generally speaking, a nighttime activity.

153
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,889
So we can beef up patrols in the business districts, usually.

154
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:40,854
Usually it's mailboxes, signs, public or private store buildings.

155
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,695
It's usually not houses, generally speaking.

156
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,196
So we need to beef up security.

157
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:46,317
But also, lighting can be added.

158
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:52,617
We need to talk to the people that own these buildings, because if you add lighting to it, people are less likely to do it.

159
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:56,479
And again, if the area is clean, it's not as contagious.

160
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,661
It is a contagious activity, absolutely, without a doubt.

161
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:06,665
If you see one beer bottle or one Pepsi can, you're likely to see another one and another one and another one.

162
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,887
Same thing with graffiti or trash.

163
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:12,569
So if we keep the area clean too, which is part of our responsibility,

164
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:23,882
That would help, but also I think the arts community could be brought into this and we can work with those people and if the business is okay with some kind of mural, that would be good too.

165
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:24,402
Thank you.

166
00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:25,823
Thank you very much, Ms.

167
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:27,163
Marantzwan.

168
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:34,066
The main motion by Councilor Caviello as amended on the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Falco.

169
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:35,527
All those in favor?

170
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:36,947
All those opposed?

171
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:38,128
Motion carries.

172
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:50,949
16-351 offered by President De La Russo, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Mr. Frederick Fred Forestier on the occasion of his upcoming 80th birthday.

173
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:57,132
Fred has been a proud, lifelong Medford resident who raised eight children.

174
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:02,714
If my colleagues will briefly indulge me to speak from the chair.

175
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:07,396
Fred is a lifelong resident here in Medford, and on the 17th,

176
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,999
He'll celebrate his 80th birthday.

177
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:18,183
He grew up on Emerald Street and spent most of his life there, living on the Felsway, actually.

178
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:24,987
And he worked for the Omaha Meatpacking Company before his retirement.

179
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:29,010
Devoted husband to his wife, Hertha.

180
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,651
And together they raised eight children.

181
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:36,374
Marie Forster, Bobby Nelson, Mary Ann DeVito,

182
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:44,690
Fred Forrestier, Fran Nelson, Cheryl Hansen, Joey Forrestier, and Hertha Rocco.

183
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,992
Freddy's known as Hun, Dad, Bambi, and Freddy.

184
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:55,817
He's loved by all of his 21 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren and many friends and extended family members.

185
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:05,723
He's very proud of being a Medford resident throughout his whole life, and he has many passions in life.

186
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:07,384
First, his family.

187
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:12,384
and second to his dedication and support of Medford sports teams.

188
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:25,019
Um, and he's a great guy, a fun guy, and we're very proud to, uh, of, uh, his lifelong residency here in the city and the Medford city council.

189
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:26,281
Fred wishes you a happier.

190
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:29,484
80th birthday, happy birthday.

191
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:36,047
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

192
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:37,787
All those opposed?

193
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:38,948
Happy birthday, Fred.

194
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:43,430
Communications.

195
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:49,952
On the motion of Councilor Knight, to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

196
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,513
All those in favor?

197
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,314
All those opposed?

198
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,435
Mr. President, we have a president here who'd like to speak.

199
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:58,633
Yes, we're going to read the papers in the hands of the clerk.

200
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:17,660
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council subcommittee on zoning ordinances meet regarding the administration's response to council paper 16-318 for the purpose of crafting a zoning ordinance change to the code 94-191 of the city ordinances.

201
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,320
Councilor Knight.

202
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,161
Mr. President, thank you very much.

203
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,762
In our council packet this week, we received a response.

204
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:36,382
to Mayor Stephanie Muccini-Burke from Paul Moki, the Building Commissioner, in response to this Council's inquiry as to recommendations relative to Zoning Ordinance 194-191.

205
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:47,610
The intent of that particular division is to reduce congestion in the streets and to contribute to traffic safety by assuring adequate places for the standing and storing of off-street motor vehicles.

206
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,653
Mr. President, we have a response that provides us with a number of different options here.

207
00:16:53,288 --> 00:17:22,168
And in the interest of due diligence and an open and transparent process, I'd like to call for a Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee, Mr. President, to review the response and to make recommendations to this August body as to changes in our zoning law to allow people to park in the front of their homes and change the current zoning ordinances that would call for 15 feet of frontage being required for the front yard of each home.

208
00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:24,973
So with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval.

209
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,934
On the motion of approval, Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

210
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:28,614
All those in favor?

211
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:29,474
All those opposed?

212
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:39,417
On the suspension, Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the recently passed Community Preservation Act be discussed regarding the exemptions available to city residents.

213
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,237
Councilor Marks.

214
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:43,818
Thank you, Mr. President.

215
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:49,980
Just recently, within the tax bills, there was a letter sent out by the city of Method

216
00:17:52,059 --> 00:18:01,421
explaining the recently passed Community Preservation Act for FY17, fiscal year 17.

217
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:18,085
And it goes on to state what the Community Preservation Act is, the amount of surcharge, which is 1.5% surcharge on your property tax bill, and for what purposes this money could be used.

218
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:33,363
And the fact that I know there was an ad hoc committee chaired by Councilor Knight that is working on creating an ordinance to govern the four members that will serve on this board, as well as some other issues.

219
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:47,908
And the one thing that this letter did not explain, and I received several calls to date, is the fact that there is an exemption for seniors and low-income residents.

220
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:52,454
And there's no mention within the letter made of that.

221
00:18:52,474 --> 00:19:02,557
I know Councilor Lungo Kern brought this up last week about how do you apply for this and who is eligible and so forth.

222
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:09,638
And I think it's only appropriate that now we're going to be hitting up residents and their tax bill.

223
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,700
We should equally let them know that there is an exemption available.

224
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:28,064
and who to contact, what is the maximum and low income requirements, what are the qualifications, the household size, and so forth.

225
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:41,852
So I would ask again that the administration provide, because I'm not sure if the committee has any, the ad hoc committee has any whereabouts with this particular function of the exemption.

226
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:43,753
I know it's created under state law,

227
00:19:44,271 --> 00:19:59,698
But I'm sure there's a due date to file for an exemption, and I'm sure the law currently spells out, which I have a copy in front of me, the maximum and low income levels that would apply.

228
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:04,320
It says income is, it's only based on your income and not assets.

229
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,141
So that's very important, Mr. President.

230
00:20:07,181 --> 00:20:12,343
Not everyone can afford to pay this additional surcharge.

231
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:15,343
And I think it's only appropriate if it's available.

232
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:28,907
And this is what was stated by the proponents during the last election, when this was a ballot question, that there will be an exemption, that we also promote the exemption to let people know what's going on.

233
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:34,849
And for those people that are eligible, that they sign up and make sure they take advantage.

234
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:38,510
So I just want to make sure that it's out there and that we get a response from

235
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:40,505
uh, the city administration.

236
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:44,707
All the motion report by council not mark celebrated, uh, seconded by council Keviel.

237
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:45,348
All those in favor.

238
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:48,029
All those vote carries off by council marks.

239
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,292
Be resolved that the C click fix program be further discussed.

240
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:56,935
I won't repeat my comments, Mr. President.

241
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:05,280
However, the, um, newly created C click fix program, which this council, uh, actually,

242
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:14,117
is on record, uh, originally asking back three or four years that the city implement this program is now up and functioning.

243
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:35,081
And, um, I was under the impression that, uh, residents, this would make it easier for residents through electronic means to get ahold of the city and to accomplish getting, um, uh, results, uh, on behalf of residents and, um, dismayed to hear that a resident already, uh,

244
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:50,958
used this particular program and was told that they should contact the state to do away with some graffiti that's on a City Welcome to the City of Method sign that's in our city but maybe falls on a state road.

245
00:21:52,319 --> 00:22:03,847
And I think that's, to me, what this whole process is supposed to be set up for is to help residents in their search

246
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:07,039
to get results of this community and not to pass the buck.

247
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:26,591
So I would ask that we ask the administration that, um, in what regards will residents be asked to make contact outside entities, outside agencies, um, and, uh, should that be the responsibility of the city?

248
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:31,494
Whereas they use and see click fix to report something directly to the city.

249
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:39,511
And I think it should fall under their scope of work to be done, Mr. President.

250
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:42,853
Mr. President, thank you very much.

251
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:47,595
And Counselor Marks, thank you very much, because I concur 110 percent with what you're saying.

252
00:22:48,596 --> 00:23:01,703
We have individuals in City Hall that have a relationship with those in state agencies that have that so-called backdoor phone number that they can pick up and call and be connected to the government affairs liaison at these agencies, whereas a regular citizen would have to

253
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:11,471
pick up the phone and go through the switchboard and then be bounced around from department to department until they get the right person on the phone and then be told, oh, sorry, there's nothing we can do.

254
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,532
We'll get back to you in a day, a week, a month, a year, not hear anything.

255
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:23,076
I think that the whole purpose and intent of the see, click, fix program is to see it, to click it, and to fix it, not to see it, click it, and get a homework assignment to go fix it yourself.

256
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:26,878
So with that being said, Councilor Marks, thank you for bringing this issue forward.

257
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:28,419
I support this measure wholeheartedly.

258
00:23:29,296 --> 00:23:31,921
On the motion approved by Councillor Marks, seconded by Councillor Knight.

259
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:32,643
All those in favour?

260
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:33,625
Opposed?

261
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,386
The motion carries.

262
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:37,533
Councillor, you have a citizen that wishes to speak on a matter.

263
00:23:41,702 --> 00:23:45,526
Good evening, welcome, and please state your name and address for the record.

264
00:23:45,546 --> 00:23:47,207
Good evening, Mr. President.

265
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:48,989
I'm Sharon Diesso, 130 Circuit Road in Medford.

266
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,050
Hello, everyone.

267
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,175
We're a little bit into the new year now, and we're all thanking you for your time and your diligent work.

268
00:23:55,996 --> 00:24:01,882
I came down because I had a couple of issues on my mind during the last month or so.

269
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:08,787
It came, I don't know if these commissions are appointed by the council or goes through the mayor's office.

270
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:18,114
One bone of contention with a couple of my friends and my neighbors, this is not why we gather, but it happens to come up, was the shelter that's in Medford Square.

271
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:27,902
I happened to address this issue by a short article of the transcript about a month ago and got some responses, you know, phone, et cetera,

272
00:24:28,622 --> 00:24:35,568
A $25,000 paid commission was going to be appointed for people to think about what could go there.

273
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:44,775
We can't imagine that with the appointed officials, voted officials, you're all very worthy and very bright.

274
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:51,200
Or even, has it ever been suggested before, these commissions are allotted this money in writing out these checks.

275
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:54,223
We don't even know anyone who has been appointed to it yet.

276
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:55,804
It's never appeared in the paper again.

277
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,005
Maybe the public has ideas.

278
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:03,607
Maybe there could be a cut-out session in the transcript of the Mercury where people could actually respond.

279
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:06,468
What about the people who are actually paying for it?

280
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:07,049
What would they...

281
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:09,302
deemed to be needed there.

282
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:18,431
Just a suggestion in case you want to do something else with the $25,000, like put it towards the women's locker room at the police station.

283
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:21,133
I mean, we're so appreciative of you.

284
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,775
We're not up here.

285
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:24,156
And we trust you.

286
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:25,037
We vote for you.

287
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:31,703
What we don't see happening is the innovation of swapping of priorities of writing out the checks.

288
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,387
Does that ever occur to anyone?

289
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,328
We're laymen here.

290
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:42,156
So on the note of the police station, we'd like to know the status right now of the building itself.

291
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:43,778
What's going forward?

292
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:44,880
What's happening?

293
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:50,146
I also learned, I think, in certain areas, Mr. President, you can build up.

294
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:57,610
If the building is salvageable, it looks to me like the bricks are all intact on the outside.

295
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:04,973
I'm sure we have great people in our engineering and building department who could go down there and estimate the exterior structure.

296
00:26:05,473 --> 00:26:07,254
Why can't it be salvaged?

297
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:10,095
Why can't we build up if we need more room?

298
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,556
So we'd just like to know the status of the

299
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:20,959
big shelter, $25,000 commission project, and what's actually happening with the police station.

300
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:21,979
Thank you so much.

301
00:26:34,063 --> 00:26:40,465
Now that we have no business left, yes, on the motion of Councilor Knight to revert to the regular order of business.

302
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:49,147
16-354 to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155.

303
00:26:49,807 --> 00:27:03,298
Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the appropriation from certified free cash in the amount of $281,888 for the replacement of self-contained breathing apparatus

304
00:27:08,513 --> 00:27:11,415
SCBA for all firefighters.

305
00:27:11,935 --> 00:27:19,840
The city has applied for a federal grant for assistance to firefighters from the Department of Homeland Security for 90% reimbursement.

306
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,602
The federal grant awards begin in the fall.

307
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:30,826
If the city is awarded the grant either in whole or in part, the amount of the grant funding will be returned to Free Cash.

308
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:34,968
The balance in Certified Free Cash prior to this vote is $8,969,000.

309
00:27:39,332 --> 00:27:47,794
663.

310
00:27:39,372 --> 00:27:47,794
And to explain this lovely matter is our Director of Budget and Purchasing, Louise Miller.

311
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:48,794
Welcome, Miss Miller.

312
00:27:49,395 --> 00:27:49,935
Thank you.

313
00:27:50,735 --> 00:28:01,957
So the purpose of this appropriation is so that we can encumber funds as required by law in order to purchase this apparatus, the replacement of the self-contained breathing apparatus for the firefighters.

314
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:03,878
So this really is

315
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,498
not an appropriation for the purchase, but rather pending the grant.

316
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,021
And until the grant cycle goes through, we do not know what the exact amount that will be needed from free cash is.

317
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:23,565
And the fire chief is here to explain what the purpose of the self-contained breathing apparatus is or why it needs to be replaced.

318
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:24,485
If you have any questions.

319
00:28:26,926 --> 00:28:27,746
Thank you, Mr. Chief.

320
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:31,888
Good evening, Mr. President, members of the city council.

321
00:28:35,122 --> 00:28:37,103
That's why he has a beautiful name.

322
00:28:37,123 --> 00:28:38,184
Frank Kilberty Jr.

323
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:40,905
Six Adams Circle, Met Fire Chief.

324
00:28:44,947 --> 00:28:50,310
The SCBA that we're looking to purchase are Scott air packs.

325
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:55,953
We're looking to purchase 40 sets, 40 harnesses.

326
00:28:58,515 --> 00:28:59,935
In addition to the 40 harnesses, 120 bottles,

327
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:09,210
so that each harness has three bottles.

328
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,253
125 face pieces, one for every member of the department.

329
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:19,137
In addition to that, what's called a pack tracker system.

330
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:23,020
It's a handheld receiver in case a firefighter is down or lost.

331
00:29:25,102 --> 00:29:31,747
You can use the wand, it's like a wand, to help locate a downed firefighter.

332
00:29:32,947 --> 00:29:43,376
and additional truck charges, one for each pack tracker, and voice amplifiers for the face pieces.

333
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:47,119
That is the gist of it.

334
00:29:47,660 --> 00:30:00,531
There is some flow testing that comes with it, hydro testing for the bottles, and fit testing for the face pieces for each firefighter.

335
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:02,652
Very good.

336
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:05,094
If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.

337
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:06,515
Thank you, Chief.

338
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,496
And thank you for coming down.

339
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:15,642
And thank you for making this effort before for your department to replace and update always all the equipment for their safety.

340
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,703
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

341
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:18,884
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

342
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:19,504
Thank you, Ms.

343
00:30:19,544 --> 00:30:21,466
Miller and Chief Gilberti, for being here this evening.

344
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:24,568
Chief, can you tell me how old the current equipment is?

345
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:27,730
Current SCBAs are 1999.

346
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,172
They were purchased, I think, May, June of 1999.

347
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:39,979
And the SCBA for people that aren't firefighters is the mask and the oxygen tank that they wear when they go into a burning building.

348
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,741
And the last time we've had them is from 1999.

349
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:45,363
Mr. President, I don't think anybody behind this rail drives a car from 1999.

350
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:49,667
I think that this is a good appropriation and something that

351
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:56,994
we should support, especially based on the fact that we're going to get a 90% reimbursement from the government or up to a 90% reimbursement from the government, uh, God willing.

352
00:30:57,415 --> 00:31:01,537
So, um, with that being said, Mr. President, I think this is a, a good paper to move on.

353
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:05,060
I think that it's going to make our firefighters safer and that it should be supported.

354
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:05,940
Very good.

355
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,722
So on the motion approved by Councilor Knight, Councilor Scarpelli.

356
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:11,184
If I can, thank you chief for coming out tonight.

357
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:13,865
Just a question since I have you here.

358
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:16,127
Um, one thing I've been reading,

359
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:36,221
It was on social media, I read an article about a firefighter who came home after a fire, and they talked about what was left after he took his gear off, and the chemicals still left on his person, and how dangerous that is.

360
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:42,064
Something that I know that was mentioned in the past, it was a washer and dryer at each station.

361
00:31:42,845 --> 00:31:44,025
Is that something that's difficult to do?

362
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:45,246
Is it something we can?

363
00:31:45,306 --> 00:31:48,167
We have currently one washer and dryer at headquarters.

364
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,208
We don't have any in the outlying stations.

365
00:31:51,308 --> 00:32:00,072
Um, I hope to be before you in the near future to, uh, purchase a second set of firefighting gear for each of the firefighters.

366
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:04,073
And in addition to a washer dryer for each station.

367
00:32:04,393 --> 00:32:04,633
Okay.

368
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:05,794
Thank you very much.

369
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:08,915
I fully support this endeavor and I appreciate you.

370
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:09,645
It's time.

371
00:32:09,685 --> 00:32:10,205
Thank you, chief.

372
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:10,726
You're welcome.

373
00:32:10,746 --> 00:32:16,048
So on the motion of approval by council night, as seconded by councilor scapelli, councilor marks.

374
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,008
Thank you, chief.

375
00:32:18,028 --> 00:32:20,869
You just referred to a second set of turn out gear.

376
00:32:21,209 --> 00:32:21,430
Yes.

377
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:35,735
Um, it was, uh, I believe two years ago, uh, during budget that a second set of, uh, turnout gear was actually made a promise by then mayor McGlynn, uh, to supply this.

378
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:38,002
Why have we not seen this?

379
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:49,211
I asked this, I believe it was two weeks ago, and I was told that we went into great detail about the need, first of all, for a second set of turnout gear.

380
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:59,960
The fact that many, especially the newcomers, some of the old timers had two sets, but many of the newcomers didn't have a second set.

381
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:03,283
Why are we at this point where we don't have a second set?

382
00:33:03,743 --> 00:33:06,125
Most of the department does have a second set.

383
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:12,035
most do, because we just recently bought a brand new set for everyone.

384
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:16,321
Okay, they're about a year to a year and a half old maximum.

385
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:24,010
And the sets, the gear that they had prior to that, some of them are six years old, seven years old.

386
00:33:24,892 --> 00:33:27,313
Some are 10 years old, and 10 years old is the limit.

387
00:33:28,054 --> 00:33:34,978
So they do have those that they can use in a pinch, but I'm looking to buy a brand new set for everyone.

388
00:33:35,758 --> 00:33:49,186
And if I remember correctly, I'm not quite sure, when we did have that meeting a couple of years ago, the council was nice enough to appropriate the funds, and I think that was for the gear that we bought a year or so ago.

389
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:53,537
I'm not sure if we had spoken about a second set at that time.

390
00:33:53,677 --> 00:34:05,966
Yeah, the whole issue was surrounding a second set of gear and many of the firefighters had a concern that they'll go out and they'll be in a fire and then they have to wear the same gear that they just were in a fire with.

391
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:12,511
So just off the top you had what percentage of the firefighters now don't have a second assigned to them?

392
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:13,332
I'm not talking about

393
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:17,862
one assigned to a station, assigned to firefighters?

394
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:24,749
I think those with seven years or so on the job and greater do have a second set.

395
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:31,196
Folks that we hired in September of 12, September of 13, they don't.

396
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,878
So what percent is that of the force?

397
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:43,115
10 in 2012, we hired seven in 2013, and just recently, last year, we hired three more.

398
00:34:43,135 --> 00:34:45,035
So you're looking at 10, how many?

399
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:46,836
About 20 people.

400
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:51,837
So you're saying currently, right now, there's only 20 people that don't have a second set assigned to them?

401
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:52,638
Yes.

402
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:54,378
Assigned to them, yes.

403
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:56,919
And like I say, most of the department does have it.

404
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:03,441
A lot of the stuff is older, seven years old, 10 years old, but they do have it.

405
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:08,093
Okay, and the walkie-talkies, how are the walkie-talkies working?

406
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:10,435
Communication?

407
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:11,216
Radios?

408
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:12,717
I don't have a problem.

409
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:18,783
There's no issue, there's no issue with the towers, there's no issue with the... No, no, please, no.

410
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:20,444
So everything's been working fine?

411
00:35:20,824 --> 00:35:21,065
Yes.

412
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:22,906
Yep.

413
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:25,328
And any need for new trucks?

414
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,233
Yes, I'm looking for a ladder truck in the very near future, yes.

415
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:32,293
Maybe an additional pump.

416
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:39,036
I saw yesterday in the snowstorm, uh, the old fire pickup truck going around salt in the streets.

417
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:43,658
Is that something that is, that is a truck that, uh, the maintenance facility has.

418
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:51,802
So that was one of the, it was one of the pickups that we had, uh, when I had the mechanic at, at my facility.

419
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:52,362
Right.

420
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,163
But that was his truck.

421
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:55,344
I've never seen it out salt in the streets.

422
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:56,304
Is that something new?

423
00:35:56,504 --> 00:35:57,365
That's something new to me.

424
00:35:57,385 --> 00:35:57,565
Yeah.

425
00:35:58,764 --> 00:36:01,586
Is that that's DPW though, but they're using that vehicle.

426
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:03,848
So it's not one of your vehicles.

427
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:04,449
No, no.

428
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,211
Even though it says fight department on the side.

429
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:10,554
Thank you, chief.

430
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:11,054
Okay.

431
00:36:13,557 --> 00:36:21,964
On the motion approved by counselor night, seconded by council Scott Pelly, a roll call vote is required.

432
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:24,526
Is it a first reading Mr. Clark or is it an appropriation?

433
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:26,888
So this is a vote, uh,

434
00:36:27,496 --> 00:36:28,717
requires just one reading.

435
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:30,018
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

436
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:31,740
Yes.

437
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:34,062
Yes.

438
00:36:34,482 --> 00:36:36,083
Yes.

439
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:37,505
Yes.

440
00:36:38,686 --> 00:36:40,247
Yes.

441
00:36:40,507 --> 00:36:40,787
Yes.

442
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:44,370
With the vote of six in the affirmative with one absent.

443
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:45,852
Congratulations.

444
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,132
Sheep.

445
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:46,812
Thank you, Mr. President.

446
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:47,953
Appropriation passes.

447
00:36:48,134 --> 00:36:48,454
Thank you.

448
00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:49,074
Thank you everyone.

449
00:36:49,154 --> 00:36:49,635
Appreciate it.

450
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:50,415
Much appreciate it.

451
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:54,179
The records.

452
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:58,778
Before we read the records, Councilor Marks.

453
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:09,601
Longtime Method resident and Method High School Spanish teacher, who we all know, Mrs. Lepore, just received the Mustang Spirit Award.

454
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:10,241
Yes.

455
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:17,603
Any time that you receive an award, not only from your peers, but from students, I think says a lot about the teacher.

456
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:22,564
And Mrs. Lepore has been an advisor for the Foreign Language Club for a number of years.

457
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:25,725
She's been a Spanish teacher for over 20 years,

458
00:37:26,585 --> 00:37:33,652
and also organizes the trips to Puerto Rico, Spain, Mexico, Cuba, and does a great job.

459
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:34,953
Don't forget Italy.

460
00:37:35,874 --> 00:37:36,314
In Italy.

461
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:45,283
And I wish her well in her future endeavors and also want to congratulate her on this prestigious award.

462
00:37:46,653 --> 00:38:02,053
So on the motion of congratulations, and that a citation be sent on behalf of the City Council, offered by Councilor Marks and seconded by Councilor- I interrupt you, accept the citation, that would be nice.

463
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:11,355
and that we extend to the professora an invitation up to receive that citation.

464
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:16,817
So on that motion, all those in favor, all those opposed, congratulations.

465
00:38:18,037 --> 00:38:20,598
Councilor Scarpelli, please.

466
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:24,018
Thank you for giving me one minute.

467
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:29,720
I just wanted to talk about an evening last Friday night, a night for the Russos that

468
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:33,896
Again, it was an outstanding turnout.

469
00:38:34,476 --> 00:38:43,924
Again, I want to thank my colleague Avnight for helping with the generous donation to the organization.

470
00:38:43,964 --> 00:38:45,685
We did a great job for the family.

471
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:46,526
They were very happy.

472
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:53,812
And again, it tells you how great Medford is, that when someone's in need, how great people rally around in one email.

473
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:57,215
And many people came out to support.

474
00:38:58,325 --> 00:38:59,165
support the family.

475
00:38:59,185 --> 00:39:05,567
I just wanted to thank the city of Medford again for their, their, uh, their generosity and their support.

476
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:07,067
Thank you very much.

477
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:07,588
Counselor.

478
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:08,688
That was a great event.

479
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,288
Thank you.

480
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:17,230
Uh, so, uh, the records of the meeting of March 29th, 2016, we'll pass the councilor Carviel.

481
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,891
Mr. Counselor, how'd you find those records?

482
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:23,592
Uh, Mr. President, uh, I, it's been brought to my attention that there's an error in the records and, um,

483
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:30,017
I will make a notation in here for the clerk to make the necessary change, then that they would be fine.

484
00:39:30,497 --> 00:39:38,879
And so on the motion for one error to be amended by Councilor Caravaglio.

485
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,260
It'll be 16-357.

486
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:41,580
On 16-357.

487
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:41,580
337.

488
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,741
337.

489
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,741
On that motion, all those in favor?

490
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:45,821
All those opposed?

491
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:48,742
Mr. President, before we end the meeting.

492
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:50,362
Oh, Councilor Marks.

493
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,603
Let me turn on your microphone.

494
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:53,623
Just a moment, Councilor.

495
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:55,529
Thank you, Mr. President.

496
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:08,979
Myself and Councilor Caviello had the opportunity last week to attend the first meeting of a new neighborhood crime watch group in West Meffitt at the Shiloh Baptist Church.

497
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:14,302
And there were probably over 100 residents there, and it was well attended.

498
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:19,146
And members of Meffitt's finest, the police department, were present.

499
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:22,108
And there were many concerns from area residents

500
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:27,381
As we all know, there's been a rash of home break-ins in the West Meffitt area.

501
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:37,948
And according to the police department, since January, I'm sorry, I think it was March 15th of this year.

502
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,890
Counsel, do you remember how many break-ins there were altogether?

503
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:40,890
12.

504
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,493
There were 12 break-ins with a number of them in the West Meffitt area.

505
00:40:46,874 --> 00:40:48,895
So residents are concerned on what's going on.

506
00:40:49,382 --> 00:40:52,104
ways they can help assist the police department.

507
00:40:53,385 --> 00:41:01,551
There was also a lot of discussion in bringing back community policing, which everyone behind this rail I think supports wholeheartedly.

508
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:17,744
And I know there's another meeting coming up soon about creating a crime watch group that will actually go out and walk the neighborhood and be the eyes and ears of the police department and also have a network where residents can notify each other.

509
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:19,125
And I'm hoping that

510
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:36,630
this will spring to other parts of the city so we can now communicate from Wellington to North Method to Salt to West Method to the hillside and allow all these particular groups to network and assist the police in doing their job, Mr. President.

511
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:43,734
But I want to thank the residents that turned out that night.

512
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:48,918
It was a great showing and there were a lot of concerns about issues taking place in the area.

513
00:41:49,745 --> 00:42:02,876
And, um, uh, I, I recommended when I spoke that, uh, if, uh, the residents would like to come up to the council meeting and speak before the council and some of the concerns they have.

514
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:09,061
I know I've been asking for, I think it's three years now to have a public safety summit.

515
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:12,104
And I look back at some of my old records.

516
00:42:12,984 --> 00:42:15,446
Council Penta wasn't the only one to keep records for 30 years.

517
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:17,368
I look back at some of my old records.

518
00:42:17,982 --> 00:42:20,483
And I found a resolution back, it was three years ago.

519
00:42:21,284 --> 00:42:23,665
And at the time, there was a rash of robberies in the city.

520
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:28,387
And I think there was 87 house break-ins back some three years ago.

521
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:35,430
And I asked for a public safety summit to sit down with the elected officials, sit down with public safety, and see what we can do.

522
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:39,632
And to date, I have yet to get a call from Chief Sacco.

523
00:42:39,652 --> 00:42:45,235
I have yet to get a call from anyone from the administration about setting up a public safety.

524
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:52,562
And I know you said you were going to work on setting something up, Mr. President, but this is a major concern.

525
00:42:53,083 --> 00:43:03,311
You know, when people feel like they're being followed, you know, when people are going to church and people know when they're going to church and their house gets robbed, that's a concern in this city.

526
00:43:03,811 --> 00:43:14,620
And when the police department states that this may be part of a ring that's operating in Brookline and some other communities, you know, of robberies, that's a major concern in this city.

527
00:43:15,118 --> 00:43:17,760
And I just don't feel the outcry, to be quite honest with that.

528
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,781
I have to be frank.

529
00:43:19,241 --> 00:43:23,344
I don't feel the outcry from public safety officials in this community.

530
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:36,633
And when residents say, you know, I don't see police coming up and down my street, and a police officer says, well, ma'am, you're not at your door seven days a week, 24 hours a day, I think that's a lousy answer to give a resident.

531
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:39,315
I really think that's a lousy answer to give a resident.

532
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:42,911
So, I think we have to do more, Mr. President.

533
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:58,862
And maybe this could be a shot across the bow to the administration, as well as this council, to set this public safety forum up so we can welcome residents and public safety officials to have a discussion and dialogue.

534
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:00,243
There's nothing wrong with that.

535
00:44:00,563 --> 00:44:04,826
That's healthy to discuss issues that we may be having in this community, Mr. President.

536
00:44:05,086 --> 00:44:05,907
I thank you for the time.

537
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:07,058
Thank you, Counselor.

538
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:07,699
Counselor Caviello.

539
00:44:07,899 --> 00:44:08,559
Thank you, Mr. President.

540
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,341
Tom, again, the two of us were there.

541
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:17,806
I mean, this was a hastily called meeting within a week, Mr. President, and they had well over 100 people there.

542
00:44:18,326 --> 00:44:29,834
And some of the things you heard was there was a lot of break-ins, especially car break-ins, that the police didn't even know about that had gone uncalled into the police.

543
00:44:30,474 --> 00:44:34,337
And again, Counselor Moxley is right.

544
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:43,024
they want to see more of a police presence on the streets, driving up and down, walking, and that was one of their biggest concerns.

545
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:51,888
And there was even some people, they said they were afraid to call the police, which I didn't understand some of those comments that were made.

546
00:44:53,288 --> 00:45:05,293
So again, I would hope that the Chief got the message that was sent to him that there should be more cars going down there, especially during the nighttime,

547
00:45:05,552 --> 00:45:06,333
and even during the day.

548
00:45:06,953 --> 00:45:10,696
And again, you know, my message to them was the same that the Chief says.

549
00:45:11,357 --> 00:45:12,878
If you're not comfortable with something, call.

550
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,380
If you see something that doesn't look right, call.

551
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,902
Don't be afraid not to call.

552
00:45:18,202 --> 00:45:19,323
Call, say something.

553
00:45:19,643 --> 00:45:20,784
See something, say something.

554
00:45:21,965 --> 00:45:22,725
That's the only way to do it.

555
00:45:24,267 --> 00:45:25,467
Thank you very much, Counselor.

556
00:45:26,068 --> 00:45:26,728
On the motion of counsel.

557
00:45:26,748 --> 00:45:27,829
Mr. President, just if I could.

558
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:31,572
You triggered something off in my head.

559
00:45:32,973 --> 00:45:39,118
One of the other issues that were brought up that night was residents were asking, well, why don't we see more police on the street?

560
00:45:39,178 --> 00:45:42,320
Why don't we see more visual patrols around?

561
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,362
And they were told that due to budget cuts.

562
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:50,366
So right away, myself and Rick were the only elected officials in the room.

563
00:45:51,026 --> 00:45:52,968
And the meeting turned to us.

564
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:56,751
And I couldn't explain budget cuts for the police department.

565
00:45:57,553 --> 00:46:01,796
All I know is for the last 20 years, taxes have been going up in the city.

566
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:06,778
There's been no budget cuts that I know of directly within the police department.

567
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:15,424
You know, they should be calling for a list every year that this council has been asking to increase the manpower, but it's not due to budget cuts.

568
00:46:15,784 --> 00:46:16,904
It's due to priorities.

569
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:21,227
And if the police department had a priority of community policing,

570
00:46:21,668 --> 00:46:28,870
and bringing back police on bicycles and motorcycles and maybe even foot patrol in certain areas, that would be the priority.

571
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:33,672
So the excuse of budget cuts in the police department, I just don't buy.

572
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:36,793
And also the fact that

573
00:46:37,203 --> 00:46:53,712
It was a year and a half ago when the administration, as well as this council, voted to take a bulk of the responsibilities from the police department of ticketing, which is a major job, away from the police department, although they still have responsibilities.

574
00:46:54,213 --> 00:47:02,157
That was supposed to be to free them up to do these other activities, to make sure that they're out there and they're doing the networking,

575
00:47:02,536 --> 00:47:07,800
in community policing, and not give them the menial stuff of going out tagging.

576
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:11,383
And I don't see a difference, to be quite honest with you.

577
00:47:11,403 --> 00:47:19,890
So these are the things I think we have to sit down at a table and discuss, because the residents have every right to say, well, budget cuts.

578
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,630
What's being cut?

579
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,072
My taxes are going up every year.

580
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,742
The administration, everything's going up around this city.

581
00:47:26,103 --> 00:47:27,623
What are we talking about cuts?

582
00:47:27,823 --> 00:47:29,024
Who's cutting the police department?

583
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:29,784
It's not us.

584
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:32,706
I haven't asked for cuts in the police department.

585
00:47:33,606 --> 00:47:36,568
And I don't see that as an excuse.

586
00:47:36,908 --> 00:47:45,212
If the levels are low, the administration should be asking us every year when the chief comes before us, I need men, I need more boots on the street.

587
00:47:45,252 --> 00:47:47,213
I need women and men on the streets.

588
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:49,574
And then this council can act.

589
00:47:50,154 --> 00:47:52,315
Or then this council can make recommendations.

590
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:53,721
It's the same with cruises.

591
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:59,024
I mean, you're talking about police cruises that have 90, 100, 120,000 miles.

592
00:47:59,304 --> 00:48:02,245
They're running seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

593
00:48:02,985 --> 00:48:04,006
That should be an automatic.

594
00:48:04,086 --> 00:48:10,729
Every budget, there should be five or six cruises that are put on in the budget process.

595
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,990
That's just a part of operating a city.

596
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,051
And to me, we're falling short of the mark.

597
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:20,633
And some of the excuses we're coming up with now, with budget cuts and lack of manning,

598
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,932
To me, you know, residents aren't going to buy this.

599
00:48:24,032 --> 00:48:28,094
And we need to sit down and discuss these issues, Mr. President.

600
00:48:30,055 --> 00:48:30,315
Ma'am.

601
00:48:31,336 --> 00:48:31,416
Ms.

602
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:32,416
Martin-Tencombe Street.

603
00:48:32,837 --> 00:48:38,400
This is a very, very, very complex issue, and it involves a whole host of issues.

604
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,282
It's not as simple as, you know, let's just put some people on the street.

605
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:46,485
It is very complex, and it needs a summit, Mr. Marks.

606
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:50,747
You're absolutely right, because we need to look at police reform and

607
00:48:51,123 --> 00:48:58,266
We do have too few officers, and it involves overtime, it involves details, it involves the numbers that we don't have.

608
00:48:58,667 --> 00:49:03,909
But it also involves police taking responsibility for themselves as well.

609
00:49:04,429 --> 00:49:09,232
And they're not gonna like what I'm saying, but it's true, they need to be more proactive in this city.

610
00:49:09,552 --> 00:49:14,834
But they get mistreated, so it's easy to, they feel a little bit defensive.

611
00:49:15,715 --> 00:49:19,857
That said, and I agree, and I'm an advocate for the police, you know that, I'm up here every week.

612
00:49:21,187 --> 00:49:29,710
One thing that I would like to recommend is, and they're not going to like me for this, is putting a device on each cruiser that tracks where they go throughout the city.

613
00:49:31,611 --> 00:49:39,253
Because sometimes, and I've seen it myself, I know they're not going to like me, cruisers can be found behind buildings for a long period of time.

614
00:49:39,754 --> 00:49:41,094
They're just chilling out someplace.

615
00:49:41,994 --> 00:49:43,915
So that behavior needs to stop.

616
00:49:43,975 --> 00:49:44,735
They're exhausted.

617
00:49:45,556 --> 00:49:49,417
You know, there are reasons why they are not proactive in this city.

618
00:49:49,758 --> 00:49:52,560
There are reasons why they are not as proactive as they need to be.

619
00:49:53,181 --> 00:49:55,462
But at the same time, we do need to hold them accountable.

620
00:49:55,983 --> 00:49:58,645
But we can't hold them accountable till we give them what they need.

621
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:01,186
So it's both.

622
00:50:01,226 --> 00:50:13,796
It's a balance of giving them all the resources they need and then lifting up their spirits so that they'll want to be more proactive and not so, oh, well, I'm not going to answer that call.

623
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:19,440
I hear from people in stop and shop, I'll call the police, and I never hear that go over

624
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:25,954
police scanner, that call that I just called in for a parked car that's been there for three days, it never goes out.

625
00:50:26,454 --> 00:50:31,115
So there's somebody filtering the information through the station.

626
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:34,876
And it's because if it's not dire, it doesn't go out.

627
00:50:35,636 --> 00:50:39,938
And that's the way that the police respond in a lot of positions in a lot of conditions.

628
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:45,019
But again, it is a complex issue and it requires a summit.

629
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:46,999
It is, I'm not bashing the police.

630
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,680
Please do not misunderstand.

631
00:50:49,262 --> 00:50:50,543
that I am not bashing the police.

632
00:50:51,303 --> 00:50:54,544
The police are under a lot of stress and duress these days.

633
00:50:55,204 --> 00:50:56,465
But it is a give and take.

634
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,326
And when we step up, they need to step up too.

635
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:03,588
But we need to have that summit so that everybody's working on the same page.

636
00:51:04,288 --> 00:51:04,908
Thank you very much.

637
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:06,289
Thank you.

638
00:51:06,629 --> 00:51:09,130
The motion of Councilor Scott Pellitt to receive and place on file.

639
00:51:10,305 --> 00:51:14,788
Brief comment, it's me again, Sharon Diaso.

640
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:23,334
I want to thank Councilors Carriello and especially Councilor Moxton for bringing up the subject of the police department.

641
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:27,457
We especially, our neighbors too, we don't have complaints.

642
00:51:28,138 --> 00:51:37,824
We're very grateful for the time that the police extend to us and their life is usually on the line along with the fire department who are so great when my parents were ill.

643
00:51:39,185 --> 00:51:44,769
But we had a suggestion, and it kind of slipped my mind, so thanks for bringing it up tonight, Mike.

644
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:59,677
About a month or so ago, I was visiting a neighbor, and she said, you know, you've got to be careful, because during the last two months, there have been, and I live right near Governor's Avenue on that side, Mass Ave.

645
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:05,280
There were 13 carviendalisms in a period of about six weeks.

646
00:52:06,601 --> 00:52:08,102
So I asked some of the other neighbors.

647
00:52:08,142 --> 00:52:09,563
They didn't know anything about it.

648
00:52:10,423 --> 00:52:15,285
Of course, most of us work during the day, and we don't see if there's a cruiser coming around.

649
00:52:15,305 --> 00:52:16,086
I'm sure there were.

650
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:23,969
However, most of these vandalisms occurred during the night, late, you know, in the middle of the night.

651
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,892
Would it be suggestible, or is it your job, or is it the neighbor's job?

652
00:52:29,998 --> 00:52:45,130
to at least, if something does happen on like a high basis, can't they send out like a letter or something to the neighborhood saying make sure your car is in the driveway before you go to bed, make sure you check to make sure that your car is locked?

653
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:47,192
Is that advisable, Councilor Mox?

654
00:52:47,232 --> 00:52:48,653
What do you think about something like that?

655
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:51,095
And we do thank the police and firefighters again.

656
00:52:51,155 --> 00:52:51,475
Thank you.

657
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:12,053
Sharon brings up a great point, and I think a reverse 9-1-1 call would be adequate, especially to target certain areas.

658
00:53:12,673 --> 00:53:19,115
With that system, it has the capability of you can notify particular neighborhoods, streets, wards, precincts.

659
00:53:20,095 --> 00:53:21,755
You can notify whatever section you like.

660
00:53:21,815 --> 00:53:33,417
And to me, that would be the intent of the reverse 9-1-1, to allow, when there was a rash of robberies in West Meffitt, they called the West Meffitt area and failed to call other parts of the city.

661
00:53:34,153 --> 00:53:41,281
And in my opinion, if there's robberies in one section of the city, I think the whole entire city should be on notice.

662
00:53:41,741 --> 00:53:43,343
Because robbers are smart.

663
00:53:43,383 --> 00:53:44,925
They're not going to stay in the same neighborhood.

664
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:48,288
They're going to move to a different section of the city.

665
00:53:48,669 --> 00:53:51,231
So I think we could use the 911 for that purpose.

666
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:52,813
But that's a great comment.

667
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:57,300
On the motion of Councilor Scott Pelley to receive in place on file, all those in favor?

668
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,641
All those opposed?

669
00:53:59,962 --> 00:54:02,104
Motion for adjournment by Councilor Scott Pelley.

670
00:54:02,124 --> 00:54:02,844
All those in favor?

671
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:05,126
All those opposed?

672
00:54:05,146 --> 00:54:05,807
Meeting adjourned.

673
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:06,467
Thank you all.

674
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,589
This meeting was not broadcast.
