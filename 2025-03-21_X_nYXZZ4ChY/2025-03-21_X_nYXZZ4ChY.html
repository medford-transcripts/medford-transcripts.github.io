    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=120.498s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=122.919s">While</a>  we're under suspension, a communication from the mayor, 16-354, to the honorable president and members of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=134.527s">On</a>  the motion of council and I to revert back to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=137.188s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=138.349s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=139.47s">Motion</a>  granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=140.671s">Regular</a>  order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=143.869s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Caraviello be it resolved that the Medford City Council for the second time demand that graffiti on the Bigelow building on the corner of Forrest and Salem Street be removed immediately.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=156.758s">Councilor</a>  Carvey. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=158.54s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=159.32s">Mr.</a>  President, you know, this is the second time I've asked for that property to be cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=163.463s">I</a>  mean, Forrest Street is one of the busiest cities in our street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=167.506s">We</a>  have events at the Chevalier Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=170.148s">People</a>  are coming out of the, you know, talk about gateway of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=175.18s">If</a>  that's the gateway we want people to see, it's not making a very good impression. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=180.704s">And</a>  Mr. President, and also, if you'll notice that now the building across the street is now being tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=188.23s">It</a>  is properties in West Bedford, Central Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=193.667s">I'd</a>  like to see our code enforcement officer, if I'm not mistaken, I think in our budget last year was a part-time code enforcement officer, am I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=203.874s">Yes,</a>  it was, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=205.115s">Well,</a>  I'd like to see our part-time enforcement officer out on the street and picking up some of these obvious violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=212.099s">A</a>  couple of years ago, Councilor Marks made a motion, 14685, about maybe getting some funding <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=221.161s">For</a>  the city, if the landlord doesn't do it, then we can get out there and pay someone to do it ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=225.942s">And</a>  obviously that motion went nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=230.104s">And</a>  again, the Forest Street one, it's the gateway to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=237.525s">People</a>  come down it, you have events at the Chevalier all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=241.086s">I</a>  mean, it's up on the top there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=242.167s">I</a>  mean, it's by people's windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=244.047s">I</a>  don't know why the people themselves who live in the building haven't complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=247.489s">But</a>  again, if we can get the code officer, postman officer to take care of that property and the other properties and let them go around and it's not demanding that these businesses start cleaning up our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=258.917s">I'm</a>  tired of listening to the people tell us how dirty our city looks.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=263.821s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=264.161s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=265.743s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=266.943s">I</a>  just want to thank a councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward a second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=271.167s">I</a>  think it's important, especially with, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=273.578s">people</a>  tagging and putting up graffiti that, you know, we're persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=277.04s">We</a>  stay on top of this because if you let it go, it just leads to more and more tagging throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=282.882s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=284.263s">It's</a>  happening throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=285.644s">I</a>  have received a number of calls about specific properties as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=290.086s">On</a>  Spring Street, the corner of Spring and Washington, there's a business that's been tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=295.093s">If</a>  you take a look at 7th Canal, which has been a hot topic, that's a building that's been tagged when you come out of the parking lot in West Bedford Square, you'll see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=303.298s">And</a>  also on Riverside Ave, the back of the Sloan building, if you take a look at the second floor, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=310.965s">There's</a>  graffiti all along the side of that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=313.887s">So</a>  we really need to make sure that we get on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=318.11s">It</a>  needs to stop, but we need to make sure that it stops right away before it gets out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=322.732s">I</a>  mean, many people would say it's out of control now, so we really need to jump on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=327.055s">And</a>  I thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing it forward.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=330.137s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=330.918s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=331.858s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=334.42s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=337.214s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello is right, I think it was about two years ago I offered a resolution and it was based actually on the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=345.438s">The</a>  city of Somerville has a program that the city will have, whether it's a private owner or a public building, they will have the owner sign a waiver form. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=358.965s">And</a>  if the owner is unable to remove the graffiti based on financial means, the city will step in, as long as there's no liability from this waiver, and they'll remove the graffiti off the side of a home or a building and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=373.799s">I</a>  think the one thing that I emphasized two years ago was that if I happen to own a business in the square and someone comes up and tags the whole side of my building, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=384.628s">And</a>  then the city, the next day, knocks on my door and says, if you don't remove this graffiti, we're going to start fining you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=391.772s">I</a>  think that adds insult to injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=396.295s">The</a>  business owner, really, by no fault of their own, was tagged by someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=404.281s">It's</a>  a hardship first of all, and that could be for any property owner too. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=407.922s">That</a>  could be your house, my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=409.742s">If</a>  someone comes up and spray paints the side of my house, I may not have the means to have that removed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=415.664s">And</a>  I think the city of Somerville offers a great service to the residents of the community to allow that service. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=423.846s">And</a>  I believe it was two years ago that I asked that we be able to do our own graffiti removal rather than rely on, right now, the Middlesex County Sheriff's Office <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=433.848s">does</a>  a bulk of our graffiti removal within the community, upon request. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=439.453s">So,</a>  I'm not sure what the machinery costs, but I think it's worthwhile looking into. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=445.297s">It's</a>  similar to what Councilor Falco offered not too recently about the plowing of the sidewalks, Councilor Scarpelli about the Porter Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=455.266s">and</a>  other initiatives in the community that I believe as a community this size, we should be offering, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=462.815s">So</a>  I would ask my council colleague, if you wouldn't mind amending it, asking through his resolution, once again, that the city administration look into buying the equipment for removal, because again, I want to stress <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=476.219s">I'm</a>  not in favor of going out and just start fining people that were under the unfortunate circumstance of having graffiti sprayed all over their building or whatever it might be, your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=488.502s">And</a>  I'm more in favor of having the city have an option that frees us from any liability that will remove graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=497.705s">And</a>  I agree with Councilor Falco and Councilor, what's your name again? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=506.925s">Caraviello,</a>  Councilor Caraviello, Mr. President, that, you know, the more you leave the graffiti out there, it's like the old broken window concept, and it creates more broken windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=519.131s">So</a>  I agree we have to clean it up, but I just don't agree with going after the business owner or the homeowner if they're financially strapped, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=528.128s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=533.331s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=536.133s">I</a>  have no problem changing that for my councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=539.215s">You</a>  know, it's time we start investing in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=542.837s">This</a>  is a relatively small investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=546.679s">It's</a>  not that it's on a million dollar piece of equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=550.402s">So</a>  again, I'll support that motion to have the city go out and investigate the purchases of that piece of equipment, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=557.835s">On</a>  the motion approved by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=562.157s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=563.778s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=565.919s">If</a>  I may offer, if I may amend the resolution to include the properties that I mentioned earlier, that they be addressed as well in addition to the Bigelow building, if we could get the back of the Sloan.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=577.164s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Falco to include the aforementioned additional addresses, which are, Councilor?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=583.907s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=586.897s">The</a>  Sloan building on Riverside Ave, the backside of the Sloan building, 7 Canal, and I don't have the exact address, but I can get you the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=595.563s">There's</a>  an address on Spring Street as well.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=602.769s">On</a>  that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=603.549s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=605.27s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=606.651s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=607.392s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper to request a report from the C-Click Fix Program relative to the requests to remove graffiti.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=616.547s">an</a>  additional amendment by Councilor Knight to request an update from the C-Click Fix Program as to the number of graffiti removal reportings that they've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=630.732s">And</a>  locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=631.612s">And</a>  locations, if you could. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=633.913s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=635.473s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=636.534s">I'll</a>  just speak briefly on this because I have a resolution under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=641.696s">However,</a>  I did receive an email from a gentleman in the community that just used <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=646.671s">the</a>  C-Click Fix website and he reported graffiti on the Route 16 West sign and it's spray painted with all black spray paint on it and he used C-Click Fix and he got a response back within minutes <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=665.307s">saying</a>  thank you very much for reporting your issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=668.19s">However,</a>  that road is operated by DCR and here's the phone number to DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=674.455s">And</a>  I'm not sure my opinion of C-Click Fix is if you bring an issue to the city, they should work on that issue on behalf of the resident and not just give the resident a phone number to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=688.347s">Whether</a>  it's a state road or a city road, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=691.588s">That</a>  should be the resident alerting the city of what needs to take place and then the city taking action. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=697.532s">But</a>  I'll speak to that in a later.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=699.254s">If</a>  you want, we can take these remarks with you on this resolution and we can have you withdraw your motion.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=708.04s">I'd</a>  rather keep that, but where Councilor Falco was talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=712.163s">where</a>  it's such in vague form. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=714.204s">Other</a>  places that need graffiti removal, I would also add the Route 16 West sign entering Method now says, Ernie Me Moomy, because you can't read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=729.369s">So</a>  I would ask that that be done, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=731.67s">Further</a>  resolution by Councilor Falco on the main motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=735.771s">Speaker</a>  at the podium, please know that you are welcome to state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=742.042s">Thank</a>  you, Gene Martington, Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=744.163s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this up, Mr. Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=745.904s">And</a>  I would just like to add that this is, generally speaking, a nighttime activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=750.667s">So</a>  we can beef up patrols in the business districts, usually. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=754.39s">Usually</a>  it's mailboxes, signs, public or private store buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=760.894s">It's</a>  usually not houses, generally speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=762.995s">So</a>  we need to beef up security. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=764.216s">But</a>  also, lighting can be added. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=766.753s">We</a>  need to talk to the people that own these buildings, because if you add lighting to it, people are less likely to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=773.017s">And</a>  again, if the area is clean, it's not as contagious. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=777.039s">It</a>  is a contagious activity, absolutely, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=780.081s">If</a>  you see one beer bottle or one Pepsi can, you're likely to see another one and another one and another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=787.166s">Same</a>  thing with graffiti or trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=789.407s">So</a>  if we keep the area clean too, which is part of our responsibility, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=793.638s">That</a>  would help, but also I think the arts community could be brought into this and we can work with those people and if the business is okay with some kind of mural, that would be good too. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=804.082s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=978.84s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=980.301s">In</a>  our council packet this week, we received a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=983.714s">to</a>  Mayor Stephanie Muccini-Burke from Paul Moki, the Building Commissioner, in response to this Council's inquiry as to recommendations relative to Zoning Ordinance 194-191. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=998.304s">The</a>  intent of that particular division is to reduce congestion in the streets and to contribute to traffic safety by assuring adequate places for the standing and storing of off-street motor vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1008.61s">Mr.</a>  President, we have a response that provides us with a number of different options here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1013.288s">And</a>  in the interest of due diligence and an open and transparent process, I'd like to call for a Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee, Mr. President, to review the response and to make recommendations to this August body as to changes in our zoning law to allow people to park in the front of their homes and change the current zoning ordinances that would call for 15 feet of frontage being required for the front yard of each home. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1042.632s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1045.513s">On</a>  the motion of approval, Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1047.974s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1048.934s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1051.114s">On</a>  the suspension, Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the recently passed Community Preservation Act be discussed regarding the exemptions available to city residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1059.517s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1062.838s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1064.838s">Just</a>  recently, within the tax bills, there was a letter sent out by the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1072.059s">explaining</a>  the recently passed Community Preservation Act for FY17, fiscal year 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1082.322s">And</a>  it goes on to state what the Community Preservation Act is, the amount of surcharge, which is 1.5% surcharge on your property tax bill, and for what purposes this money could be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1098.697s">And</a>  the fact that I know there was an ad hoc committee chaired by Councilor Knight that is working on creating an ordinance to govern the four members that will serve on this board, as well as some other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1114.283s">And</a>  the one thing that this letter did not explain, and I received several calls to date, is the fact that there is an exemption for seniors and low-income residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1128.733s">And</a>  there's no mention within the letter made of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1132.474s">I</a>  know Councilor Lungo-Koehn brought this up last week about how do you apply for this and who is eligible and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1143.417s">And</a>  I think it's only appropriate that now we're going to be hitting up residents and their tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1150.279s">We</a>  should equally let them know that there is an exemption available. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1156.538s">and</a>  who to contact, what is the maximum and low income requirements, what are the qualifications, the household size, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1168.184s">So</a>  I would ask again that the administration provide, because I'm not sure if the committee has any, the ad hoc committee has any whereabouts with this particular function of the exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1182.192s">I</a>  know it's created under state law, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1184.271s">But</a>  I'm sure there's a due date to file for an exemption, and I'm sure the law currently spells out, which I have a copy in front of me, the maximum and low income levels that would apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1200.078s">It</a>  says income is, it's only based on your income and not assets. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1205.02s">So</a>  that's very important, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1207.181s">Not</a>  everyone can afford to pay this additional surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1213.142s">And</a>  I think it's only appropriate if it's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1215.743s">And</a>  this is what was stated by the proponents during the last election, when this was a ballot question, that there will be an exemption, that we also promote the exemption to let people know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1229.507s">And</a>  for those people that are eligible, that they sign up and make sure they take advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1234.909s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that it's out there and that we get a response from <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1239.244s">uh,</a>  the city administration.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1240.825s">All</a>  the motion report by council not mark celebrated, uh, seconded by council Keviel. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1244.747s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1245.788s">All</a>  those vote carries off by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1248.41s">Be</a>  resolved that the C click fix program be further discussed.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1252.872s">I</a>  won't repeat my comments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1257.215s">However,</a>  the, um, newly created C click fix program, which this council, uh, actually, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1265.736s">is</a>  on record, uh, originally asking back three or four years that the city implement this program is now up and functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1274.938s">And,</a>  um, I was under the impression that, uh, residents, this would make it easier for residents through electronic means to get ahold of the city and to accomplish getting, um, uh, results, uh, on behalf of residents and, um, dismayed to hear that a resident already, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1295.628s">used</a>  this particular program and was told that they should contact the state to do away with some graffiti that's on a City Welcome to the City of Method sign that's in our city but maybe falls on a state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1312.319s">And</a>  I think that's, to me, what this whole process is supposed to be set up for is to help residents in their search <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1324.337s">to</a>  get results of this community and not to pass the buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1327.079s">So</a>  I would ask that we ask the administration that, um, in what regards will residents be asked to make contact outside entities, outside agencies, um, and, uh, should that be the responsibility of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1346.951s">Whereas</a>  they use and see click fix to report something directly to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1352.347s">And</a>  I think it should fall under their scope of work to be done, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1361.612s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1362.893s">And</a>  Councilor Marks, thank you very much, because I concur 110 percent with what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1368.596s">We</a>  have individuals in City Hall that have a relationship with those in state agencies that have that so-called backdoor phone number that they can pick up and call and be connected to the government affairs liaison at these agencies, whereas a regular citizen would have to <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1382.046s">pick</a>  up the phone and go through the switchboard and then be bounced around from department to department until they get the right person on the phone and then be told, oh, sorry, there's nothing we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1391.491s">We'll</a>  get back to you in a day, a week, a month, a year, not hear anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1394.572s">I</a>  think that the whole purpose and intent of the see, click, fix program is to see it, to click it, and to fix it, not to see it, click it, and get a homework assignment to go fix it yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1403.937s">So</a>  with that being said, Councilor Marks, thank you for bringing this issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1406.918s">I</a>  support this measure wholeheartedly.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1425.546s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1427.307s">I'm</a>  Sharon Diesso, 130 Circuit Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1429.329s">Hello,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1430.07s">We're</a>  a little bit into the new year now, and we're all thanking you for your time and your diligent work. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1435.996s">I</a>  came down because I had a couple of issues on my mind during the last month or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1442.842s">It</a>  came, I don't know if these commissions are appointed by the council or goes through the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1449.448s">One</a>  bone of contention with a couple of my friends and my neighbors, this is not why we gather, but it happens to come up, was the shelter that's in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1458.715s">I</a>  happened to address this issue by a short article of the transcript about a month ago and got some responses, you know, phone, et cetera, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1468.622s">A</a>  $25,000 paid commission was going to be appointed for people to think about what could go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1476.809s">We</a>  can't imagine that with the appointed officials, voted officials, you're all very worthy and very bright. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1485.736s">Or</a>  even, has it ever been suggested before, these commissions are allotted this money in writing out these checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1491.941s">We</a>  don't even know anyone who has been appointed to it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1494.283s">It's</a>  never appeared in the paper again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1496.464s">Maybe</a>  the public has ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1498.425s">Maybe</a>  there could be a cut-out session in the transcript of the Mercury where people could actually respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1503.967s">What</a>  about the people who are actually paying for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1506.568s">What</a>  would they... <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1508.081s">deemed</a>  to be needed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1509.963s">Just</a>  a suggestion in case you want to do something else with the $25,000, like put it towards the women's locker room at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1518.891s">I</a>  mean, we're so appreciative of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1521.354s">We're</a>  not up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1523.296s">And</a>  we trust you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1524.236s">We</a>  vote for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1525.057s">What</a>  we don't see happening is the innovation of swapping of priorities of writing out the checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1532.344s">Does</a>  that ever occur to anyone? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1534.407s">We're</a>  laymen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1535.929s">So</a>  on the note of the police station, we'd like to know the status right now of the building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1542.657s">What's</a>  going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1544.099s">What's</a>  happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1545.801s">I</a>  also learned, I think, in certain areas, Mr. President, you can build up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1550.967s">If</a>  the building is salvageable, it looks to me like the bricks are all intact on the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1558.01s">I'm</a>  sure we have great people in our engineering and building department who could go down there and estimate the exterior structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1565.473s">Why</a>  can't it be salvaged? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1567.634s">Why</a>  can't we build up if we need more room? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1570.535s">So</a>  we'd just like to know the status of the <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1573.036s">big</a>  shelter, $25,000 commission project, and what's actually happening with the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1581.139s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1594.063s">Now</a>  that we have no business left, yes, on the motion of Councilor Knight to revert to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1601.08s">16-354</a>  to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1609.807s">Dear</a>  Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approve the appropriation from certified free cash in the amount of $281,888 for the replacement of self-contained breathing apparatus <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1628.513s">SCBA</a>  for all firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1631.935s">The</a>  city has applied for a federal grant for assistance to firefighters from the Department of Homeland Security for 90% reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1640.34s">The</a>  federal grant awards begin in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1644.022s">If</a>  the city is awarded the grant either in whole or in part, the amount of the grant funding will be returned to Free Cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1651.266s">The</a>  balance in Certified Free Cash prior to this vote is $8,969,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1659.332s">663.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1659.372s">And</a>  to explain this lovely matter is our Director of Budget and Purchasing, Louise Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1668.014s">Welcome,</a>  Miss Miller.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1669.395s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1670.735s">So</a>  the purpose of this appropriation is so that we can encumber funds as required by law in order to purchase this apparatus, the replacement of the self-contained breathing apparatus for the firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1683.138s">So</a>  this really is <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1684.917s">not</a>  an appropriation for the purchase, but rather pending the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1688.799s">And</a>  until the grant cycle goes through, we do not know what the exact amount that will be needed from free cash is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1696.022s">And</a>  the fire chief is here to explain what the purpose of the self-contained breathing apparatus is or why it needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1703.605s">If</a>  you have any questions.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1706.926s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chief.</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1709.987s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President, members of the city council.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1715.122s">That's</a>  why he has a beautiful name.</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1717.123s">Frank</a>  Kilberty Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1718.204s">Six</a>  Adams Circle, Met Fire Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1724.947s">The</a>  SCBA that we're looking to purchase are Scott air packs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1731.691s">We're</a>  looking to purchase 40 sets, 40 harnesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1738.515s">In</a>  addition to the 40 harnesses, 120 bottles, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1745.267s">so</a>  that each harness has three bottles. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1749.23s">125</a>  face pieces, one for every member of the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1755.214s">In</a>  addition to that, what's called a pack tracker system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1759.838s">It's</a>  a handheld receiver in case a firefighter is down or lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1765.102s">You</a>  can use the wand, it's like a wand, to help locate a downed firefighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1772.947s">and</a>  additional truck charges, one for each pack tracker, and voice amplifiers for the face pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1784.977s">That</a>  is the gist of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1787.66s">There</a>  is some flow testing that comes with it, hydro testing for the bottles, and fit testing for the face pieces for each firefighter.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1802.192s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1802.833s">If</a>  you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1805.915s">Thank</a>  you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1806.555s">And</a>  thank you for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1807.516s">And</a>  thank you for making this effort before for your department to replace and update always all the equipment for their safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1815.982s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1817.743s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1818.904s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1819.544s">Miller</a>  and Chief Gilberti, for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1821.806s">Chief,</a>  can you tell me how old the current equipment is?</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1825.589s">Current</a>  SCBAs are 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1827.95s">They</a>  were purchased, I think, May, June of 1999.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1832.093s">And</a>  the SCBA for people that aren't firefighters is the mask and the oxygen tank that they wear when they go into a burning building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1840.66s">And</a>  the last time we've had them is from 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1841.781s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't think anybody behind this rail drives a car from 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1845.644s">I</a>  think that this is a good appropriation and something that <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1850.31s">we</a>  should support, especially based on the fact that we're going to get a 90% reimbursement from the government or up to a 90% reimbursement from the government, uh, God willing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1857.415s">So,</a>  um, with that being said, Mr. President, I think this is a, a good paper to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1861.577s">I</a>  think that it's going to make our firefighters safer and that it should be supported.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1865.62s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1866.12s">So</a>  on the motion approved by Councilor Knight, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1869.022s">If</a>  I can, thank you chief for coming out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1871.524s">Just</a>  a question since I have you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1874.426s">Um,</a>  one thing I've been reading, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1876.793s">It</a>  was on social media, I read an article about a firefighter who came home after a fire, and they talked about what was left after he took his gear off, and the chemicals still left on his person, and how dangerous that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1896.641s">Something</a>  that I know that was mentioned in the past, it was a washer and dryer at each station. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1902.845s">Is</a>  that something that's difficult to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1904.126s">Is</a>  it something we can?</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1905.306s">We</a>  have currently one washer and dryer at headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1908.367s">We</a>  don't have any in the outlying stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1911.308s">Um,</a>  I hope to be before you in the near future to, uh, purchase a second set of firefighting gear for each of the firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1920.832s">And</a>  in addition to a washer dryer for each station.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1924.393s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1925.114s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1925.814s">I</a>  fully support this endeavor and I appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1929.265s">It's</a>  time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1929.685s">Thank</a>  you, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1930.245s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1930.746s">So</a>  on the motion of approval by council night, as seconded by councilor scapelli, councilor marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1936.568s">Thank</a>  you, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1938.028s">You</a>  just referred to a second set of turn out gear.</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1941.209s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1942.01s">Um,</a>  it was, uh, I believe two years ago, uh, during budget that a second set of, uh, turnout gear was actually made a promise by then mayor McGlynn, uh, to supply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1956.961s">Why</a>  have we not seen this? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1958.082s">I</a>  asked this, I believe it was two weeks ago, and I was told that we went into great detail about the need, first of all, for a second set of turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1969.972s">The</a>  fact that many, especially the newcomers, some of the old timers had two sets, but many of the newcomers didn't have a second set. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1980.881s">Why</a>  are we at this point where we don't have a second set?</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1983.743s">Most</a>  of the department does have a second set. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1986.588s">most</a>  do, because we just recently bought a brand new set for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1992.856s">Okay,</a>  they're about a year to a year and a half old maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1997.142s">And</a>  the sets, the gear that they had prior to that, some of them are six years old, seven years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2004.892s">Some</a>  are 10 years old, and 10 years old is the limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2008.054s">So</a>  they do have those that they can use in a pinch, but I'm looking to buy a brand new set for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2015.758s">And</a>  if I remember correctly, I'm not quite sure, when we did have that meeting a couple of years ago, the council was nice enough to appropriate the funds, and I think that was for the gear that we bought a year or so ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2030.535s">I'm</a>  not sure if we had spoken about a second set at that time.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2033.677s">Yeah,</a>  the whole issue was surrounding a second set of gear and many of the firefighters had a concern that they'll go out and they'll be in a fire and then they have to wear the same gear that they just were in a fire with. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2046.727s">So</a>  just off the top you had what percentage of the firefighters now don't have a second assigned to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2052.531s">I'm</a>  not talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2053.717s">one</a>  assigned to a station, assigned to firefighters?</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2058.242s">I</a>  think those with seven years or so on the job and greater do have a second set. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2065.53s">Folks</a>  that we hired in September of 12, September of 13, they don't.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2071.336s">So</a>  what percent is that of the force?</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2077.113s">10</a>  in 2012, we hired seven in 2013, and just recently, last year, we hired three more. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2083.135s">So</a>  you're looking at 10, how many? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2085.095s">About</a>  20 people.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2086.876s">So</a>  you're saying currently, right now, there's only 20 people that don't have a second set assigned to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2092.438s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2093.578s">Assigned</a>  to them, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2094.758s">And</a>  like I say, most of the department does have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2097.519s">A</a>  lot of the stuff is older, seven years old, 10 years old, but they do have it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2105.551s">Okay,</a>  and the walkie-talkies, how are the walkie-talkies working? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2109.855s">Communication?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2110.856s">Radios?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2112.017s">I</a>  don't have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2114.119s">There's</a>  no issue, there's no issue with the towers, there's no issue with the... No, no, please, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2119.043s">So</a>  everything's been working fine? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2120.824s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2122.766s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2123.647s">And</a>  any need for new trucks?</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2127.47s">Yes,</a>  I'm looking for a ladder truck in the very near future, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2131.292s">Maybe</a>  an additional pump.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2132.653s">I</a>  saw yesterday in the snowstorm, uh, the old fire pickup truck going around salt in the streets.</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2139.776s">Is</a>  that something that is, that is a truck that, uh, the maintenance facility has. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2145.259s">So</a>  that was one of the, it was one of the pickups that we had, uh, when I had the mechanic at, at my facility.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2152.222s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2152.402s">But</a>  that was his truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2153.183s">I've</a>  never seen it out salt in the streets.</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2155.584s">Is</a>  that something new? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2156.504s">That's</a>  something new to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2157.385s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2158.764s">Is</a>  that that's DPW though, but they're using that vehicle.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2162.707s">So</a>  it's not one of your vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2164.009s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2165.69s">Even</a>  though it says fight department on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2170.074s">Thank</a>  you, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2170.794s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2173.557s">On</a>  the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by council Scarpelli, a roll call vote is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2182.004s">Is</a>  it a first reading Mr. Clark or is it an appropriation? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2184.966s">So</a>  this is a vote, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2187.496s">requires</a>  just one reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2188.737s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2191.499s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2193.021s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2194.482s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2197.164s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2198.686s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2200.507s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2200.907s">With</a>  the vote of six in the affirmative with one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2205.071s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2205.912s">Sheep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2206.332s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2206.832s">Appropriation</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2208.134s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2208.494s">Thank</a>  you everyone.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2209.154s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2209.675s">Much</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2213.418s">The</a>  records.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2216.397s">Before</a>  we read the records, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2219.758s">Longtime</a>  Method resident and Method High School Spanish teacher, who we all know, Mrs. Lepore, just received the Mustang Spirit Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2229.941s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2231.101s">Any</a>  time that you receive an award, not only from your peers, but from students, I think says a lot about the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2238.263s">And</a>  Mrs. Lepore has been an advisor for the Foreign Language Club for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2243.204s">She's</a>  been a Spanish teacher for over 20 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2246.585s">and</a>  also organizes the trips to Puerto Rico, Spain, Mexico, Cuba, and does a great job.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2254.152s">Don't</a>  forget Italy.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2255.874s">In</a>  Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2257.055s">And</a>  I wish her well in her future endeavors and also want to congratulate her on this prestigious award.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2266.653s">So</a>  on the motion of congratulations, and that a citation be sent on behalf of the City Council, offered by Councilor Marks and seconded by Councilor- I interrupt you, accept the citation, that would be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2282.513s">and</a>  that we extend to the professora an invitation up to receive that citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2291.755s">So</a>  on that motion, all those in favor, all those opposed, congratulations.</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2298.037s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, please.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2301.198s">Thank</a>  you for giving me one minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2304.098s">I</a>  just wanted to talk about an evening last Friday night, a night for the Russos that <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2310.633s">Again,</a>  it was an outstanding turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2314.476s">Again,</a>  I want to thank my colleague Avnight for helping with the generous donation to the organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2323.964s">We</a>  did a great job for the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2325.725s">They</a>  were very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2327.126s">And</a>  again, it tells you how great Medford is, that when someone's in need, how great people rally around in one email. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2333.852s">And</a>  many people came out to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2338.325s">support</a>  the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2339.185s">I</a>  just wanted to thank the city of Medford again for their, their, uh, their generosity and their support. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2346.287s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2347.187s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2347.828s">That</a>  was a great event. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2348.888s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2349.808s">Uh,</a>  so, uh, the records of the meeting of March 29th, 2016, we'll pass the councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2357.27s">Mr.</a>  Councilor, how'd you find those records? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2359.711s">Uh,</a>  Mr. President, uh, I, it's been brought to my attention that there's an error in the records and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2364.655s">I</a>  will make a notation in here for the clerk to make the necessary change, then that they would be fine.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2370.497s">And</a>  so on the motion for one error to be amended by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2378.959s">It'll</a>  be 16-357. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2381.5s">On</a>  16-357. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2382.48s">337.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2383.12s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2385.141s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2385.861s">Mr.</a>  President, before we end the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2389.082s">Oh,</a>  Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2391.422s">Let</a>  me turn on your microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2392.643s">Just</a>  a moment, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2394.588s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2396.61s">Myself</a>  and Councilor Caraviello had the opportunity last week to attend the first meeting of a new neighborhood crime watch group in West Medford at the Shiloh Baptist Church. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2409.879s">And</a>  there were probably over 100 residents there, and it was well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2415.063s">And</a>  members of Medford's finest, the police department, were present. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2419.886s">And</a>  there were many concerns from area residents <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2422.618s">As</a>  we all know, there's been a rash of home break-ins in the West Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2428.242s">And</a>  according to the police department, since January, I'm sorry, I think it was March 15th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2438.708s">Counsel,</a>  do you remember how many break-ins there were altogether? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2441.95s">There</a>  were 12 break-ins with a number of them in the West Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2446.874s">So</a>  residents are concerned on what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2449.382s">ways</a>  they can help assist the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2453.385s">There</a>  was also a lot of discussion in bringing back community policing, which everyone behind this rail I think supports wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2462.432s">And</a>  I know there's another meeting coming up soon about creating a crime watch group that will actually go out and walk the neighborhood and be the eyes and ears of the police department and also have a network where residents can notify each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2478.284s">And</a>  I'm hoping that <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2479.778s">this</a>  will spring to other parts of the city so we can now communicate from Wellington to North Method to Salt to West Method to the hillside and allow all these particular groups to network and assist the police in doing their job, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2496.67s">But</a>  I want to thank the residents that turned out that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2503.754s">It</a>  was a great showing and there were a lot of concerns about issues taking place in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2509.745s">And,</a>  um, uh, I, I recommended when I spoke that, uh, if, uh, the residents would like to come up to the council meeting and speak before the council and some of the concerns they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2523.356s">I</a>  know I've been asking for, I think it's three years now to have a public safety summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2529.862s">And</a>  I look back at some of my old records. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2532.984s">Council</a>  Penta wasn't the only one to keep records for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2535.947s">I</a>  look back at some of my old records. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2537.982s">And</a>  I found a resolution back, it was three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2541.284s">And</a>  at the time, there was a rash of robberies in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2544.385s">And</a>  I think there was 87 house break-ins back some three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2549.007s">And</a>  I asked for a public safety summit to sit down with the elected officials, sit down with public safety, and see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2556.211s">And</a>  to date, I have yet to get a call from Chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2559.652s">I</a>  have yet to get a call from anyone from the administration about setting up a public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2565.997s">And</a>  I know you said you were going to work on setting something up, Mr. President, but this is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2573.083s">You</a>  know, when people feel like they're being followed, you know, when people are going to church and people know when they're going to church and their house gets robbed, that's a concern in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2583.811s">And</a>  when the police department states that this may be part of a ring that's operating in Brookline and some other communities, you know, of robberies, that's a major concern in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2595.118s">And</a>  I just don't feel the outcry, to be quite honest with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2597.98s">I</a>  have to be frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2599.241s">I</a>  don't feel the outcry from public safety officials in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2604.004s">And</a>  when residents say, you know, I don't see police coming up and down my street, and a police officer says, well, ma'am, you're not at your door seven days a week, 24 hours a day, I think that's a lousy answer to give a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2617.194s">I</a>  really think that's a lousy answer to give a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2619.749s">So,</a>  I think we have to do more, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2623.592s">And</a>  maybe this could be a shot across the bow to the administration, as well as this council, to set this public safety forum up so we can welcome residents and public safety officials to have a discussion and dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2639.102s">There's</a>  nothing wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2640.563s">That's</a>  healthy to discuss issues that we may be having in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2645.086s">I</a>  thank you for the time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2646.338s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2647.079s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2647.899s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2648.58s">Tom,</a>  again, the two of us were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2651.762s">I</a>  mean, this was a hastily called meeting within a week, Mr. President, and they had well over 100 people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2658.326s">And</a>  some of the things you heard was there was a lot of break-ins, especially car break-ins, that the police didn't even know about that had gone uncalled into the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2670.474s">And</a>  again, Councilor Marksley is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2675.461s">they</a>  want to see more of a police presence on the streets, driving up and down, walking, and that was one of their biggest concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2683.564s">And</a>  there was even some people, they said they were afraid to call the police, which I didn't understand some of those comments that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2693.288s">So</a>  again, I would hope that the Chief got the message that was sent to him that there should be more cars going down there, especially during the nighttime, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2705.552s">and</a>  even during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2706.953s">And</a>  again, you know, my message to them was the same that the Chief says. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2711.357s">If</a>  you're not comfortable with something, call. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2713.078s">If</a>  you see something that doesn't look right, call. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2715.9s">Don't</a>  be afraid not to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2718.202s">Call,</a>  say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2719.643s">See</a>  something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2721.965s">That's</a>  the only way to do it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2724.267s">Thank</a>  you very much, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2726.068s">On</a>  the motion of counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2726.748s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2730.271s">You</a>  triggered something off in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2732.973s">One</a>  of the other issues that were brought up that night was residents were asking, well, why don't we see more police on the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2739.178s">Why</a>  don't we see more visual patrols around? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2742.96s">And</a>  they were told that due to budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2746.143s">So</a>  right away, myself and Rick were the only elected officials in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2751.026s">And</a>  the meeting turned to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2753.708s">And</a>  I couldn't explain budget cuts for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2757.553s">All</a>  I know is for the last 20 years, taxes have been going up in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2762.396s">There's</a>  been no budget cuts that I know of directly within the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2767.939s">You</a>  know, they should be calling for a list every year that this council has been asking to increase the manpower, but it's not due to budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2775.784s">It's</a>  due to priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2777.445s">And</a>  if the police department had a priority of community policing, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2781.668s">and</a>  bringing back police on bicycles and motorcycles and maybe even foot patrol in certain areas, that would be the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2788.95s">So</a>  the excuse of budget cuts in the police department, I just don't buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2793.692s">And</a>  also the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2797.203s">It</a>  was a year and a half ago when the administration, as well as this council, voted to take a bulk of the responsibilities from the police department of ticketing, which is a major job, away from the police department, although they still have responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2814.213s">That</a>  was supposed to be to free them up to do these other activities, to make sure that they're out there and they're doing the networking, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2822.536s">in</a>  community policing, and not give them the menial stuff of going out tagging. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2828.501s">And</a>  I don't see a difference, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2831.403s">So</a>  these are the things I think we have to sit down at a table and discuss, because the residents have every right to say, well, budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2839.97s">What's</a>  being cut? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2840.65s">My</a>  taxes are going up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2842.881s">The</a>  administration, everything's going up around this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2846.103s">What</a>  are we talking about cuts? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2847.823s">Who's</a>  cutting the police department? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2849.244s">It's</a>  not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2850.585s">I</a>  haven't asked for cuts in the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2853.606s">And</a>  I don't see that as an excuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2856.908s">If</a>  the levels are low, the administration should be asking us every year when the chief comes before us, I need men, I need more boots on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2865.252s">I</a>  need women and men on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2868.213s">And</a>  then this council can act. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2870.154s">Or</a>  then this council can make recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2872.601s">It's</a>  the same with cruises. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2874.522s">I</a>  mean, you're talking about police cruises that have 90, 100, 120,000 miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2879.304s">They're</a>  running seven days a week, 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2882.985s">That</a>  should be an automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2884.086s">Every</a>  budget, there should be five or six cruises that are put on in the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2891.149s">That's</a>  just a part of operating a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2893.59s">And</a>  to me, we're falling short of the mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2896.631s">And</a>  some of the excuses we're coming up with now, with budget cuts and lack of manning, <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2901.45s">To</a>  me, you know, residents aren't going to buy this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2904.032s">And</a>  we need to sit down and discuss these issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2910.055s">Ma'am.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2911.336s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2911.436s">Martin-Tencombe</a>  Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2912.837s">This</a>  is a very, very, very complex issue, and it involves a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2919.14s">It's</a>  not as simple as, you know, let's just put some people on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2922.962s">It</a>  is very complex, and it needs a summit, Mr. Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2926.505s">You're</a>  absolutely right, because we need to look at police reform and <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2931.123s">We</a>  do have too few officers, and it involves overtime, it involves details, it involves the numbers that we don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2938.667s">But</a>  it also involves police taking responsibility for themselves as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2944.429s">And</a>  they're not gonna like what I'm saying, but it's true, they need to be more proactive in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2949.552s">But</a>  they get mistreated, so it's easy to, they feel a little bit defensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2955.715s">That</a>  said, and I agree, and I'm an advocate for the police, you know that, I'm up here every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2961.187s">One</a>  thing that I would like to recommend is, and they're not going to like me for this, is putting a device on each cruiser that tracks where they go throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2971.611s">Because</a>  sometimes, and I've seen it myself, I know they're not going to like me, cruisers can be found behind buildings for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2979.754s">They're</a>  just chilling out someplace. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2981.994s">So</a>  that behavior needs to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2983.975s">They're</a>  exhausted. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2985.556s">You</a>  know, there are reasons why they are not proactive in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2989.758s">There</a>  are reasons why they are not as proactive as they need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2993.181s">But</a>  at the same time, we do need to hold them accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2995.983s">But</a>  we can't hold them accountable till we give them what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=2999.165s">So</a>  it's both. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3001.226s">It's</a>  a balance of giving them all the resources they need and then lifting up their spirits so that they'll want to be more proactive and not so, oh, well, I'm not going to answer that call. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3014.136s">I</a>  hear from people in stop and shop, I'll call the police, and I never hear that go over <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3020.052s">police</a>  scanner, that call that I just called in for a parked car that's been there for three days, it never goes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3026.454s">So</a>  there's somebody filtering the information through the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3031.795s">And</a>  it's because if it's not dire, it doesn't go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3035.636s">And</a>  that's the way that the police respond in a lot of positions in a lot of conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3040.838s">But</a>  again, it is a complex issue and it requires a summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3045.499s">It</a>  is, I'm not bashing the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3047.42s">Please</a>  do not misunderstand. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3049.262s">that</a>  I am not bashing the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3051.303s">The</a>  police are under a lot of stress and duress these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3055.204s">But</a>  it is a give and take. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3056.845s">And</a>  when we step up, they need to step up too. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3060.266s">But</a>  we need to have that summit so that everybody's working on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3064.288s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3065.869s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3066.629s">The</a>  motion of Councilor Scarpellitt to receive and place on file.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3070.305s">Brief</a>  comment, it's me again, Sharon Diaso. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3075.028s">I</a>  want to thank Councilors Caraviello and especially Councilor Markston for bringing up the subject of the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3084.495s">We</a>  especially, our neighbors too, we don't have complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3088.138s">We're</a>  very grateful for the time that the police extend to us and their life is usually on the line along with the fire department who are so great when my parents were ill. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3099.185s">But</a>  we had a suggestion, and it kind of slipped my mind, so thanks for bringing it up tonight, Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3105.269s">About</a>  a month or so ago, I was visiting a neighbor, and she said, you know, you've got to be careful, because during the last two months, there have been, and I live right near Governor's Avenue on that side, Mass Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3120.418s">There</a>  were 13 carviendalisms in a period of about six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3126.601s">So</a>  I asked some of the other neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3128.142s">They</a>  didn't know anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3130.423s">Of</a>  course, most of us work during the day, and we don't see if there's a cruiser coming around. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3135.305s">I'm</a>  sure there were. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3137.846s">However,</a>  most of these vandalisms occurred during the night, late, you know, in the middle of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3145.53s">Would</a>  it be suggestible, or is it your job, or is it the neighbor's job? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3149.998s">to</a>  at least, if something does happen on like a high basis, can't they send out like a letter or something to the neighborhood saying make sure your car is in the driveway before you go to bed, make sure you check to make sure that your car is locked? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3165.57s">Is</a>  that advisable, Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3167.232s">What</a>  do you think about something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3168.933s">And</a>  we do thank the police and firefighters again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3171.155s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3184.512s">Sharon</a>  brings up a great point, and I think a reverse 9-1-1 call would be adequate, especially to target certain areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3192.673s">With</a>  that system, it has the capability of you can notify particular neighborhoods, streets, wards, precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3200.095s">You</a>  can notify whatever section you like. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3201.815s">And</a>  to me, that would be the intent of the reverse 9-1-1, to allow, when there was a rash of robberies in West Medford, they called the West Medford area and failed to call other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3214.153s">And</a>  in my opinion, if there's robberies in one section of the city, I think the whole entire city should be on notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3221.741s">Because</a>  robbers are smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3223.383s">They're</a>  not going to stay in the same neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3225.225s">They're</a>  going to move to a different section of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3228.669s">So</a>  I think we could use the 911 for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3231.852s">But</a>  that's a great comment.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3233.597s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to receive in place on file, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3237.74s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3239.962s">Motion</a>  for adjournment by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3242.124s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3243.285s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3245.146s">Meeting</a>  adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3245.887s">Thank</a>  you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=3246.827s">This</a>  meeting was not broadcast.</p>
