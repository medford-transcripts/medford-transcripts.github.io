[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke.

38
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,214
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a few questions if you don't mind.

39
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:02,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

40
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:03,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

41
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:07,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

42
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:08,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

43
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,319
[SPEAKER_13]: On page first, I have a few.

44
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,400
[SPEAKER_13]: My stickies work.

45
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,061
[SPEAKER_13]: As usual, right?

46
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:16,461
[SPEAKER_13]: On page 7 of 17.

47
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:24,058
[SPEAKER_13]: The National Grilled Bill for 16-2802, it's unclassified.

48
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,780
[SPEAKER_13]: I just didn't know why it would be unclassified.

49
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:30,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it was just before.

50
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:33,765
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like the fifth one down.

51
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:42,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so that's regarding a revolving account, so the term is called unclassified for its general expenditures for the particular account.

52
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:42,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

53
00:04:44,958 --> 00:05:00,250
[SPEAKER_13]: On the next page, 8 of 17, I had a question regarding school, a third of the way down, under Trotter-Richard, $290.12 school committee superintendent's dues.

54
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:13,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was part of the superintendent's conference, MAASC, this year, and he was part of the hosting of the CCSR project down for the Cape, so that was reimbursement for some of his

55
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:28,770
[SPEAKER_13]: expenses Okay, I know that mr. Trotter retired from the school district and is still is he the director of the CCS are still yes And so he would go to that before the CCS are correct.

56
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:38,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, just just clarifying but further down the row Christine Sweeney for the amount of $250 lost books I've had deductibles and

57
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:47,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so that would have been a reimbursement from that revolving account.

58
00:05:48,510 --> 00:06:02,660
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on page 10 of 17, fourth one down, CT book holdings, it says pending classification.

59
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:07,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this is another separate fund.

60
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:08,630
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a trust fund.

61
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:11,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't have a particular breakout.

62
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:13,275
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just one line for expenditures.

63
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:16,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's considered unclassified based on what they're using it for.

64
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:17,819
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, great.

65
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,661
[SPEAKER_13]: In that, oh, one more, sorry.

66
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:23,624
[SPEAKER_13]: On page 14 of 17, second one down.

67
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:35,470
[SPEAKER_13]: It says $1,868 undistributed errors and omissions for RR Rudy insurance.

68
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:35,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

69
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,894
[SPEAKER_05]: That's insurance errors and omissions insurance for school committee policies.

70
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:40,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

71
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:45,498
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, when it said undistributed, I just, okay.

72
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:45,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

73
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are all my questions.

74
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for always answering them.

75
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:49,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve.

76
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,383
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion for approval.

77
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:51,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

78
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:53,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Vandekloot, you have to hit your button.

79
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:54,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

80
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:54,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Vandekloot.

81
00:06:58,157 --> 00:06:59,258
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a new system up here.

82
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:00,939
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to get into place.

83
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:01,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

84
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:01,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Van Kloot.

85
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:07,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Christine, I'm only mentioning this just so that in your records it doesn't cause you a problem down the line.

86
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:11,925
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a typo on page 10 of 17, Greater Boston League.

87
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:16,247
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be G-R-E-A rather than A-E.

88
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:19,169
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

89
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,650
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is the vendor.

90
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll get that adjusted and corrected.

91
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:23,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just a typo.

92
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:23,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

93
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:23,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

94
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:25,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

95
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:27,476
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Mr. Benedetto, is there a second?

96
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:29,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

97
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:30,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Second by Mr. Russo.

98
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:31,198
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

99
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:31,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

100
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:32,719
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

101
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:33,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

102
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,000

[SPEAKER_11]: Here you go, ma'am.

114
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:10,372
[SPEAKER_16]: So good evening, everyone.

115
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:15,834
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to say welcome back to year two for me, but an exciting new school year.

116
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:18,515
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't believe how time flies by.

117
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:29,959
[SPEAKER_16]: I've had the honor of serving as your superintendent for a full year now, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together as we move the Medford public schools forward.

118
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,051
[SPEAKER_16]: We are one Medford, one district.

119
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:37,874
[SPEAKER_16]: A new school year always brings with it new members of our school community.

120
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:47,300
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would like to take this opportunity just to officially introduce some of our new administrators that are here with us today and recognize them.

121
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:49,842
[SPEAKER_16]: If you are here, please feel free to stand.

122
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:54,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Our new assistant superintendent, Dr. Peter Cushing.

00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,728
[SPEAKER_16]: who will be focusing on our secondary, middle, and high schools.

[SPEAKER_16]: Joan Bowen, who replaced Kathleen Madaglio, who retired in June.

126
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:15,363
[SPEAKER_16]: And for the past six years, Director Bowen served as the coordinator of secondary special education and transition programs for the Medford Public Schools.

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,706
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a new assistant principal at the Andrews Middle School, Julia McEwen, who replaced Dave DiMattea, who retired in June.

128
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:34,973
[SPEAKER_16]: At the Curtis Tufts School, we have a new principal, Miss Lisa Kingsley, who began her duties officially today.

129
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:40,237
[SPEAKER_16]: She replaces Brian Toomey, who transitioned to a new role in another district.

130
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:54,057
[SPEAKER_16]: We'd like to recognize Alice Beth Fitzpatrick, a Medford High School guidance Councilor, who was appointed as assistant director of CTE programs for the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

131
00:09:55,218 --> 00:10:00,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Maureen Lavin, who is a veteran and middle and high school educator in Medford Public Schools.

132
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,982
[SPEAKER_16]: She was appointed to temporarily fill the director of guidance position to cover a long-term leave.

133
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:09,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Lisa Ionelli,

134
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:17,506
[SPEAKER_16]: who was appointed our coordinator of secondary special education programs at the high school, replacing Joan Bowen's position.

135
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:20,530
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'd like to recognize Lauren Perillo.

136
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:30,925
[SPEAKER_16]: who was appointed coordinator of special education programs at the Columbus, McGlynn, and Andrews middle schools, replacing Lisa Ionelli.

137
00:10:31,385 --> 00:10:40,249
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had a lot of movement happening, but I just wanted us to take this time to formally welcome all of our new additions to the Mustang family.

138
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:48,773
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this time,

139
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:58,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Over the course of the summer and at the start of the school year, we had many, many wonderful partners from the community.

140
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:08,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Team Medford and other parts of the community that are supporting our schools.

141
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:12,217
[SPEAKER_16]: And we wanted to recognize and say thank you.

142
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:21,964
[SPEAKER_16]: And so some of our wonderful community partners have actually come out today to give us this opportunity to recognize them.

143
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:26,288
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanted to ask if Miss Diane Caldwell could come forward

144
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:34,975
[SPEAKER_16]: just so that we could formally thank the many friends and partners who have supported Medford Public Schools in a very generous way.

145
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:36,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

146
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Caldwell.

147
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:42,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you and welcome back everyone.

148
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:46,379
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really good to be back, although I don't really feel like I left that much.

149
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:57,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are so very lucky to have partnerships with various different corporations and companies in Medford.

150
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,824
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'd like the team to please, all of you, come up now, starting with Sam Tarabelsi.

151
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:08,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam has been with Hallmark Health, and Sam, this is our 12th year?

152
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:13,519
[SPEAKER_07]: 12th year and counting, we never let Sam go.

153
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:21,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember Beverly Nelson saying for many, many years that she can't wait for the phone call from Mr. Terrabelsi to say, we're coming back.

154
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:27,227
[SPEAKER_07]: What all of these incredible people do behind us, and I know that you have the list.

155
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,108
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to say their names.

156
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:28,688
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

157
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:31,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Sam Terrabelsi, who's the director of infrastructure.

158
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:34,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Miss Sue Sandberg, who's the CEO.

159
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:37,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you please wave so everyone knows who you are?

160
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:38,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Sue.

161
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:41,256
[SPEAKER_16]: We have with us Janet Peralt.

162
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,016
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Janet.

163
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:46,717
[SPEAKER_16]: We have from WB Mason, Stephanie Altavesta.

164
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:54,299
[SPEAKER_16]: And from Armstrong Ambulance, Mr. Davin Forse, operations manager.

165
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:04,402
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you know, the beginning of the school year is always difficult for some of our families.

166
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:25,076
[SPEAKER_07]: In our school buildings, when we know we have 150 to 200 backpacks just jam-packed with school supplies and materials for our students, not only does that help our kiddos, it really helps the teachers and the families of our community.

167
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:31,940
[SPEAKER_07]: And so every year we welcome them back with open arms and say, thank you so much for all you do.

168
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Terrabelsi, would you like to say a few words?

169
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:38,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again, Diane.

170
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:39,217
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a pleasure.

171
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:46,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I go back 12 years ago when I first said that we're doing this for the first year, and that I will be back.

172
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:48,643
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of meant it.

173
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:51,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope I continue to do that.

174
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,685
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, it's a pleasure.

175
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:57,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these guys, again, from WB Mason,

176
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:01,770
[SPEAKER_01]: our new partner and really major sponsor.

177
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:06,113
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Armstrong who is on our team but always there for us.

178
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:12,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my teammate in the team at Medford that we go out to all the community events and we really

179
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:15,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a special event for us.

180
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,201
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's back to school drive.

181
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:19,362
[SPEAKER_01]: That really gets me excited.

182
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:24,065
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always thinking ways to contribute to the cause.

183
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:33,291
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the Method Kiwanis that, you know, even though I'm a member, I can really kind of get the money out of these guys to really contribute to these students.

184
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:34,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been tremendous.

185
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:35,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Tremendous.

186
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:39,215
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had the Rotary in the past, and we will continue to get sponsored.

187
00:14:39,615 --> 00:15:00,367
[SPEAKER_01]: But most importantly, again, and I want to make sure, our CEO, Sue Sandberg, who joined our organization, Meadows Wakefield Healthcare, and really, you know, to take the time and to be here, so special to me, to Janet, to all of us, because it really means a lot to us that we're doing the right thing for the community and for the students and for the school system.

188
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:02,349
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway, thank you.

189
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Sue, do you want to say a few words?

190
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:20,145
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, now I know you guys have been here a long time, so I would just say, I'm like you, I've been in the role now a year, and I still get giddy, though, when I hear first day of school, back from the days my kids started.

191
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:33,492
[SPEAKER_20]: But I will just say Melrose-Wakefield Healthcare really is committed to a community, and when you talk about supporting children, they are our future, so we are so glad to stand up, and to stand up with Armstrong.

192
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,854
[SPEAKER_20]: We get to work with them on a daily basis around patient care,

193
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:42,382
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's fun to be in a project like this where it's about the future of our children.

194
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:46,264
[SPEAKER_20]: And they're the ones that will be taking care of us in the future.

195
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:53,468
[SPEAKER_20]: And of course, it's fun to have someone that we actually buy material from to step up and also help donate.

196
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:55,729
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's fun to have partners and our vendors too.

197
00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:02,513
[SPEAKER_20]: So appreciate everyone here tonight and wishing you guys just a most awesome school year ahead.

198
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:03,073
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

199
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:04,414
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much.

200
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:16,376
[SPEAKER_11]: On behalf of the school committee, we want to thank Team Medford for all of your work and really being there year in and year out.

201
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:19,540
[SPEAKER_11]: It means so much, not only to us, but the children of our community.

202
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,443
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you all very, very much.

203
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:36,055
[SPEAKER_16]: I also have a few additional pointers that I want to just bring up as well.

204
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:44,857
[SPEAKER_16]: When I mentioned the extreme generosity, the generosity of the business community has been great.

205
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:55,140
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition to what Team Medford just presented, their sincere dedication to us, we also received a generous donation from Wegmans.

206
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,444
[SPEAKER_16]: of 200 backpacks that were filled with school supplies.

207
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:05,767
[SPEAKER_16]: And they came to the school and dropped them off and backpacks were sent out.

208
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:16,014
[SPEAKER_16]: And in addition to Wegmans, we had another partner, a friend of the community, a Jero that has been working with Medford Public Schools for a very, very long time.

209
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:21,818
[SPEAKER_16]: They also donated an additional 200 backpacks with school supplies.

210
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:43,384
[SPEAKER_16]: And as we present additional reports to you this evening, you'll continue to hear our partners and how we say thank you to Joseph's Transportation and many other good partners in the community that are supporting what's happening in Medford Public Schools.

211
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:47,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Over the summer, we had two first ever events.

212
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Many of you were able to come and support that.

213
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:53,208
[SPEAKER_16]: We had our sixth grade welcome barbecue.

214
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:57,370
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had our summer Medford High School graduation.

215
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,574
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to mention that in my opening remarks to thank all of you who were able to support us.

216
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:05,075
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a fun event.

217
00:18:05,476 --> 00:18:06,616
[SPEAKER_16]: We were very grateful.

218
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:09,218
[SPEAKER_16]: The weather was very cooperative.

219
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,281
[SPEAKER_16]: We were working hard, working collaboratively as a team.

220
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,884
[SPEAKER_16]: And both principals, Principal Tucci and Principal Downs,

221
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:38,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Director of Curriculum Bernadette Riccidelli, Andrew's Assistant Principal Julia McEwen, and McGlynn Assistant Principal Jody Lu, our Public Relations Director Lisa Evangelista, school committee members Kathy Crux, Mia Mastone, Paulette VanderKloot.

222
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:43,691
[SPEAKER_16]: They were able to jump in and help serve that day with food.

223
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:47,523
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to thank the city's Department of Public Works.

224
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:56,787
[SPEAKER_16]: They came out, they cleared the area, they cleaned it, made it ready for the barbecue, and they came back and they collected whatever trash was left over.

225
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,548
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're truly appreciative of the collaborative effort.

226
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:11,414
[SPEAKER_16]: And once again, Wegmans stepped up and Wegmans provided, graciously provided all the water and sports drinks to all of our students for that evening.

227
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:14,415
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had a collaborative effort of both PTOs,

228
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:21,493
[SPEAKER_16]: middle school PTOs, parents chipping in to make it such a wonderful event, and teachers working as well.

229
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:23,914
[SPEAKER_16]: So we were really, really appreciative of that.

230
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:28,236
[SPEAKER_16]: And our high school graduation, summer graduation, thank you again.

231
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:35,842
[SPEAKER_16]: for supporting that event, the headmaster, and all that happened, and you'll hear about that later today.

232
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:47,631
[SPEAKER_16]: But what I can say is that those students who graduated, they got to feel like they were Mustangs, and Mustangs never give up, even if it was a little later.

233
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:54,817
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're really proud of them, and I thank you again, the school committee, for your support during the summer months for that special event.

234
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,585
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say I'm wrapping up, but today we had another first in our district.

235
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:05,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Today was the first time we had middle school sports tryouts.

236
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,111
[SPEAKER_16]: So stay tuned.

237
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:08,532
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll be hearing more about that.

238
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:11,375
[SPEAKER_16]: But our middle school students had the opportunity.

239
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:16,094
[SPEAKER_16]: to participate in cross country, baseball, and softball.

240
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,196
[SPEAKER_16]: So tryouts are happening.

241
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:25,584
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you know, we're part of the Greater Boston League, which includes Malden, Everett, Somerville, and Revere.

242
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,446
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're excited about that.

243
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:34,889
[SPEAKER_16]: And the first game is September 16th, so you'll continue to hear about what's happening with sports, all things middle school.

244
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:48,234
[SPEAKER_16]: And last but not least, this is a quick follow-up to one of our students that graduated class of 2017, a very proud Mustang, Mr. Joseph Farrar.

245
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:55,655
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the end of the school year, last school year, we mentioned that he was working, he was part of the team.

246
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:58,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Our director of science, Rocco Sieri, had talked about it.

247
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:00,840
[SPEAKER_16]: But I just wanted to give you a highlight.

248
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:10,130
[SPEAKER_16]: We are beyond proud that Joseph Farah, a 2017 graduate of Medford High School, and currently a physics major,

249
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:18,948
[SPEAKER_16]: and at the Honors College of UMass Boston is sharing in a $3 million breakthrough prize.

250
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:28,579
[SPEAKER_16]: I just felt it was worthy of announcing to all of you for being part of the Event Horizon Telescope, the EHT.

251
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:33,722
[SPEAKER_16]: collaboration that took the first image of a black hole in April.

252
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:43,270
[SPEAKER_16]: When the image was recorded, Farrah was the only undergraduate on the 347-member team.

253
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:54,260
[SPEAKER_16]: As UMass Chancellor Newman stated, what a remarkable scientific achievement for an undergraduate to have contributed to a landmark discovery

254
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,882
[SPEAKER_16]: of this importance is nothing short of astounding.

255
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:07,569
[SPEAKER_16]: UMass Boston is immensely proud of Joseph Farris' gifts and simply delighted that he has been recognized by this award.

256
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:10,971
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to say to all of you, yes, let's give him a round of applause.

257
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:19,272
[SPEAKER_16]: I am looking forward to another great year, and as always, go Mustangs.

258
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Go Patriots.

259
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:22,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much, Madam Superintendent.

260
00:22:23,094 --> 00:22:27,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you also prepare thank yous for all of the various partners from the school committee?

261
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:28,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, definitely.

262
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:28,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

263
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:32,677
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a motion to receive this report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

264
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:33,477
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

265
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:34,717
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

266
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:35,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion carries.

267
00:22:37,258 --> 00:22:40,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Could we invite Joseph Farah to come

268
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:49,230
[SPEAKER_13]: and give him a commendation for his work and his accomplishment and bring him back into the Medford fold.

269
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I know his family very well.

270
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:55,414
[SPEAKER_13]: His brother is also a Medford High School student.

271
00:22:56,034 --> 00:22:57,055
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole family has

272
00:22:58,155 --> 00:23:01,337
[SPEAKER_13]: has excelled in science throughout their career.

273
00:23:01,497 --> 00:23:06,659
[SPEAKER_13]: One of their children graduated with my daughter, Una, and they're a remarkable family.

274
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:20,706
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we could do some type of presentation for him and bring him back and show all of MedFed how proud we are of our students that step out, because if he's at UMass Boston, he's around, and I think his family would love something like that.

275
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,988
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to celebrate what's happening in MedFed in a big way.

276
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:25,889
[SPEAKER_13]: We can definitely do that.

277
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:26,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

278
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:28,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Cushing is right there.

279
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:29,130
[SPEAKER_16]: He's going to push play.

280
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,451
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a couple of others in the queue.

281
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:31,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

282
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz, did you wish to speak on this?

283
00:23:34,572 --> 00:23:36,113
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I wanted to say it was great news.

284
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:41,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to meet him at one of the science fairs and it's just so amazing and it's incredible.

285
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:42,876
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great story.

286
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:44,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

287
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:45,937
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. Ruggiero.

288
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:49,750
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it would be great if we could have a little presentation.

289
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:57,854
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen some of the pictures of the Event Horizon Telescope and it's just amazing to actually see a black hole surrounded by all of this plasma.

290
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:02,197
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be great if we could get a presentation to our middle school students to get them excited.

291
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:07,280
[SPEAKER_16]: So here is a very short, short video.

292
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,941

347
00:30:34,401 --> 00:30:38,607
[SPEAKER_18]: We support everything you do and we're committed to touching the families of Medford together.

348
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:41,651
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to be a blessing.

349
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:46,852
[SPEAKER_18]: We sincerely thank Impact Church for their support of the McGlynn Middle School.

350
00:30:47,353 --> 00:30:53,978
[SPEAKER_18]: The importance of this gift would significantly impact our students by continuing our efforts to infuse technology into our classrooms.

351

00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,361

353
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:00,543
[SPEAKER_18]: who is the Impact Church Youth Director.

354
00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:09,849
[SPEAKER_18]: And she's very passionate about helping our church, according to Pastor Zenzo, establish some programming that will impact students, teachers, and schools in Medford.

355
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,750
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to turn the microphone over to Ms.

356
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,910
[SPEAKER_18]: Crystal Erb right now.

357
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:13,611
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

358
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

359
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:15,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

360
00:31:15,912 --> 00:31:16,793
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you all?

361
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:24,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we just want to say that Impact Church is super excited to be partnering with this community, with Medford, and with your schools.

362
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:31,973
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the same mission as the rest of the Medford community, and that's purely just building up families and doing that through equitable education.

363
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:33,534
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have

364
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:40,375
[SPEAKER_00]: A strong belief that faith and education can work really awesomely together and that you can't have one without the other.

365
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:45,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And that faith can fuel education, but you also really need education in your faith.

366
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:55,299
[SPEAKER_00]: So we as a church believe that these two communities just can go beautifully together and it really is our pleasure to donate and to be part of this community.

367
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,200
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just want to say thank you for allowing us to be in that community.

368
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,521
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are so pumped to just keep partnering with Medford and with your school district.

369
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:04,201
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

370
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:05,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

371
00:32:05,502 --> 00:32:06,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Kristol.

372
00:32:06,762 --> 00:32:12,125
[SPEAKER_11]: As always, you came through last year as well with a sizable donation for us to do some work there.

373
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:13,886
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really appreciate the partnership.

374
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:15,366
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you so much for this.

375
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:18,608
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure the kids will appreciate it as well, and maybe some thank yous from them.

376
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:19,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly.

377
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:28,152
[SPEAKER_18]: And while I have the microphone, too, as well, I also want to thank Impact Church and Pastor Zenzo for a wonderful donation of a welcome back luncheon for our teachers and faculty the first day back from school.

378
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:31,574
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're so thankful to have them as wonderful stewards of our building.

379
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:33,595
[SPEAKER_18]: And I thank you very much for your consideration.

00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:35,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:39,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a recommendation to approve the donation from Impact Church?

00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:41,703

393
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:25,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Perhaps that could go into the record.

394
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:31,557
[SPEAKER_22]: So it is our responsibility to provide students with the opportunity to think outside the classroom.

395
00:33:31,837 --> 00:33:36,044
[SPEAKER_22]: As a Medford High teacher and the founder and executive director of M3 Outdoor Adventures, a new

397
00:33:43,957 --> 00:33:53,884
[SPEAKER_22]: M3 Outdoor Adventures, or M3OA as I like to call it, was founded in 2019 as a youth-centered recreation program linking students in the greater Boston area to the natural world.

00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:55,505
[SPEAKER_22]: M3OA mission

00:33:56,077 --> 00:34:03,545
[SPEAKER_22]: is to increase student engagement and experience with local green spaces in order to encourage a lifetime of stewardship and appreciation for the outdoors.

400
00:34:04,246 --> 00:34:13,977
[SPEAKER_22]: We are seeking to create and maintain a network of multiple school-based clubs that will work in unison to help students from our schools engage in learning outside the classroom walls.

401
00:34:15,088 --> 00:34:23,250
[SPEAKER_22]: To support our mission, students and the M3AO staff will be hosting our major fall fundraiser event on October 27th, the October Fells Trail Races and Festival.

402
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:28,132
[SPEAKER_22]: This event was formerly known as the Fall for the Fells in years past.

403
00:34:28,452 --> 00:34:34,834
[SPEAKER_22]: It has attracted 150 runners and over 300 total attendees, and creating significant funding for the support of the outdoors.

404
00:34:35,394 --> 00:34:37,855
[SPEAKER_22]: With your help, we would like to make October Fells 2019 even better.

[SPEAKER_22]: Red Bones BBQ will be providing the food, and Medford Brewing Company will provide adult refreshment.

407
00:34:50,103 --> 00:34:57,209
[SPEAKER_22]: With your additional support, this year's race will be a great stride forward to getting young people of our communities outside.

408
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:58,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

409
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:07,536
[SPEAKER_11]: And for all of those that do not know Mr. Tower, he also organized the canoe, the Cabo Canoe Race at Wrights Pond at the beginning of the season, which is just a fabulous event.

410
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:14,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Tons of students are involved and teachers, and it really is a great experience for everyone that participates in that.

411

415
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:37,994
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been to the fall fells with my dog last year.

416
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:39,135
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had a blast.

418
00:35:42,137 --> 00:35:44,399

[SPEAKER_22]: It starts at 11 and should be wrapped up by 4 o'clock.

430
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:01,250
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

431
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:04,766
[SPEAKER_13]: The expected crowd?

432
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:07,850
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of weather dependent.

433
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,675
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I'm looking to get 150 runners, maybe 300 people there.

434
00:36:11,855 --> 00:36:14,018
[SPEAKER_22]: That seems to be the average that it's been.

435
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,101
[SPEAKER_22]: It could be larger, it could be smaller.

436
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:18,905
[SPEAKER_13]: And how much access to a facility will

00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:21,102

442
00:36:32,472 --> 00:36:38,318
[SPEAKER_22]: They help provide us with some tables and chairs and give us access to the porta-potties, but there's really no in-school access.

443
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:40,680
[SPEAKER_13]: You bring in porta-potties so you don't have to enter the building.

444
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:40,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

445
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,161
[SPEAKER_13]: and the building's secure and locked.

446
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:43,962
[SPEAKER_13]: That's good to know.

447
00:36:44,743 --> 00:36:46,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I just worry a little bit about security.

448
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:47,825
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, that makes sense.

449
00:36:47,865 --> 00:36:53,508
[SPEAKER_22]: There's also, usually on the Sundays, there's swimming going on, and there's somebody who's kind of watching that door.

450
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:59,833
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm always in touch with the custodian, so we really don't have anybody going into this room.

451
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:01,874
[SPEAKER_13]: And prep and cleanup will be done by your group?

452
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:03,655
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, we do it.

453
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:05,537
[SPEAKER_13]: I still have a few more questions.

454
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:09,177
[SPEAKER_13]: So all of those seem very favorable.

455
00:37:10,198 --> 00:37:12,859
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that you're applying for a liquor license on the school.

456
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:15,381
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that there's nothing left over.

457
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:17,583
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a school grounds.

458
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,724
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure someone walks around.

459
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,306
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course, we're really particular about that.

460
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:23,687
[SPEAKER_22]: I work with the local businesses.

461
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:25,028
[SPEAKER_22]: We hire a police detail.

462
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:28,971
[SPEAKER_22]: We have staff surrounding and checking IDs.

463
00:37:31,243 --> 00:37:34,485
[SPEAKER_22]: I would say official, and there's nothing to be left about.

464
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:35,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

465
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:36,627
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a question.

466
00:37:37,127 --> 00:37:44,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Do they register through community schools so we know who's using our facilities for liability purposes?

467
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:47,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Not so much for you through the superintendent.

468
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:50,076
[SPEAKER_13]: You know how they have to apply to use any facility?

469
00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:51,997
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that that paperwork's done.

470
00:37:52,397 --> 00:38:01,725
[SPEAKER_13]: and those applications in that format are logged in so that way we know what time they're coming, what time they're leaving, what the name of the group, who the responsible person is.

471
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,947
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's an issue, we have a contact number.

472
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:14,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Any group, even if we donate any part of any of our schools, should be filling that out just so if something were to happen or found later, we can have someone

473
00:38:14,737 --> 00:38:16,960
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the documentation to reach out correctly.

474
00:38:17,981 --> 00:38:20,504
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to make sure that that happens.

475
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:23,948
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't see any reason for this not to continue.

476
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,192
[SPEAKER_13]: My other question is, do we rent that facility to a church on Sundays?

477
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:30,915
[SPEAKER_13]: And how is the parking going to interact?

478
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:32,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think they have a service.

479
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:40,042
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, they've used the front recently, and parking hasn't been, they've been, I think, out before.

480
00:38:40,122 --> 00:38:44,986
[SPEAKER_22]: We've kind of had a crash of people in there, but it seems to have worked out.

481
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:50,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And have we notified them that this will be happening in the timing, so that way, you know.

482
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,393
[SPEAKER_22]: I would assume that community schools, Mr. Maloney.

483
00:38:54,453 --> 00:38:55,574
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll definitely let them know.

484
00:38:56,054 --> 00:39:03,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I know that other people in the community have asked to do road races and use that area, and timing has been an issue, and I think

485
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,288
[SPEAKER_13]: that their service is either 11.30 or 12, I'm not positive.

486
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:17,542
[SPEAKER_13]: So as long as the timing is worked out, it's just something that has to be followed up on because we have steady renters and we just want to make sure.

487
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:26,846
[SPEAKER_13]: that it works and it's safe parking and people are only parking where it's appropriate, not on the field, out and back where the kids practice football.

488
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:43,720
[SPEAKER_13]: If all those concessions are put in place, especially logging in and noting that it can be free but it has to be logged that you're using the facility and who the contact people are and people are there in place, I have no problem with it and I make a motion to second.

489
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:49,553
[SPEAKER_11]: My motion on the floor offered by his credit seconded by Mister Benedetto is being to

490
00:39:51,437 --> 00:39:53,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Tower, thank you for being here tonight.

491
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I didn't catch, I heard Red Bones.

492
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:56,741
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

493
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:57,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I didn't hear.

494
00:39:57,982 --> 00:39:58,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Brewing.

495
00:39:58,603 --> 00:39:59,463
[SPEAKER_22]: Medford Brewing Company.

496
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:02,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So Medford Brewing Company will be supplying the liquor?

497
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:02,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

498
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:03,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

499
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:03,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Beer.

500
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:04,167
[SPEAKER_22]: No liquor.

501
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:04,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Beer.

502
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:04,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Beer.

503
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:05,348
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

504
00:40:05,608 --> 00:40:06,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well it's a liquor permit.

505
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:07,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

506
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,651
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's beer.

507
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:11,153
[SPEAKER_22]: They don't have beer permits, I don't think, but I would have got one of those.

508
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:12,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's great.

509
00:40:13,134 --> 00:40:16,817
[SPEAKER_02]: My guess is if you're advertising that, you'll expect to get more than 300 people, so.

510
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:19,354
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you'd be surprised.

511
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:21,817
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, unfortunately, I'm weather dependent, and I can't.

512
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,839
[SPEAKER_22]: If it's raining, it's going to be a tough act.

513
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,001
[SPEAKER_02]: The 27th is a Sunday?

514
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:25,882
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a Sunday.

515
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:27,103
[SPEAKER_02]: So weather dependent on?

516
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:31,768
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I mean, I'm going to host it, rain or shine, but if the weather's not nice, no one's going to sit around and have a beer.

517
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:32,809
[SPEAKER_22]: They're going to go home.

518
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,591
[SPEAKER_02]: But you registered beforehand anyway.

519
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:35,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

520
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a walkers?

521
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:37,794
[SPEAKER_02]: There is.

522
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:38,815
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, there's like a one.

523
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:39,455
[SPEAKER_22]: You can walk.

524
00:40:39,876 --> 00:40:43,718
[SPEAKER_22]: There's also a handicap accessible 1K, like a family fun race.

525
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:45,139
[SPEAKER_22]: This is something I've been working on.

526
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:48,120
[SPEAKER_22]: We've been doing it with Friends of the Fells, but it was a little chaotic.

527
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,201
[SPEAKER_22]: So now we have a route planned.

528
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:58,826
[SPEAKER_22]: And I've been working with the DCR to make sure that the route has less of an environmental impact, which in the previous years, all of the racing has happened in the Lawrence Woods.

529
00:40:59,027 --> 00:41:04,610
[SPEAKER_22]: And whether you're familiar with that area, doing a 10K in the Lawrence Woods means you're crossing.

530
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,451
[SPEAKER_22]: It's almost like a maze.

531
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:13,596
[SPEAKER_22]: So now, we've expanded the course to go across into South Border Road, and that should make the course easier.

532
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:19,641
[SPEAKER_22]: And we also are looking to have a stroller-friendly 1K for kids.

533
00:41:19,941 --> 00:41:20,382
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

534
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:20,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

535
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:21,763
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you very much.

536
00:41:22,143 --> 00:41:22,463
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

537
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:23,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

538
00:41:24,305 --> 00:41:28,548
[SPEAKER_11]: And on the motion, with the amendments that were offered, Ms.

539
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:29,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Mustone, please call the roll.

540
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

541
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:39,734
[SPEAKER_11]: We wish you the best of luck.

542
00:41:39,794 --> 00:41:42,017
[SPEAKER_11]: If you need any help publicizing, let us know.

543
00:41:42,137 --> 00:41:42,437
[SPEAKER_22]: I will.

544
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:43,238
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

545
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:44,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Much appreciated.

546
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:44,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

547
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Miss, hit your button, please.

548
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:49,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

549
00:41:50,080 --> 00:42:01,947
[SPEAKER_13]: When I was at the cardboard canoe races, I thought of a really good idea, like the school committee and the city council should each make a canoe next year and participate in that.

550
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:07,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it would be a lot of fun for the kids to see and the community as a whole, and we should join in on the fun.

551
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:16,115
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know if my colleagues are interested, but I thought it might be something we should plan for the beginning of next year.

552
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:19,086
[SPEAKER_22]: Very good.

553
00:42:19,146 --> 00:42:21,708
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much, Mr. Tower.

554
00:42:21,828 --> 00:42:22,308
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

555
00:42:22,328 --> 00:42:25,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, report on administrative meetings.

556
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:25,411
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

557
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:26,271
[SPEAKER_22]: Caldwell.

558
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good evening again.

559
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:56,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So the week of August 19th through August 23rd was a busy week for both administrators and new teachers.

560
00:42:57,095 --> 00:43:02,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't go through the list of our new administrators because Dr. Vincent has already introduced them to you.

561
00:43:03,218 --> 00:43:07,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, Superintendent Vincent welcomed our administrators back on August 19th.

562
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:12,270
[SPEAKER_07]: She outlined her plans and expectations for the upcoming school year.

563
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:14,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Our administrators had an assignment.

564
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:20,416
[SPEAKER_07]: They were to read two books, Good to Great, and Culturally Responsive Teaching, and they reported back.

565
00:43:21,157 --> 00:43:28,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Vincent continues to demonstrate to all her passion for education, and we're lucky to have her in our community.

566
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:36,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Our thanks to Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli for providing her expertise and assistance for all the work she completed over the summer vacation.

567
00:43:37,054 --> 00:43:46,063
[SPEAKER_07]: She collected and organized our educator evaluations, organized professional development for the upcoming school year, and planned our new teacher

568
00:43:46,703 --> 00:43:48,164
[SPEAKER_07]: week induction program.

569
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:54,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say a big thank you to all of our principals who worked really hard over the summer, as well as Building and Grounds.

570
00:43:54,807 --> 00:43:59,510
[SPEAKER_07]: John McLaughlin and his crew made our buildings beautiful and safe to be in.

571
00:44:01,411 --> 00:44:07,234
[SPEAKER_07]: We also had a very busy summer hiring staff, preparing materials, and scheduling students.

572
00:44:07,434 --> 00:44:14,078
[SPEAKER_07]: At our administrative meetings, we discussed topics and matters of concern for the upcoming school year.

573
00:44:15,075 --> 00:44:25,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Assistant Superintendent and Director of Finance, Christine Patterson, updated the ASOP frontline system, payroll automation, and the employee portal, as well as the bus routes.

574
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:31,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, Dr. Rigodelli discussed our new teacher induction week and evaluation.

575
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:40,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Other themes of the week included professional development, personnel, school emergency plans, special education updates,

576
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:45,729
[SPEAKER_07]: medical forms, and specific updates from curriculum directors.

577
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:58,275
[SPEAKER_07]: For instance, our Director of Mathematics, Faiza Khan, discussed illustrative mathematics in our middle schools, and Director of Science, Rocco Sieri, continues to discuss our new elementary fall science curriculum.

578
00:44:59,136 --> 00:45:10,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Director of Speech and Language, Susanna Campbell, updated our administrators on the new screener pilot grant for the Columbus Elementary School, and we'll give you a report on that, maybe in a few weeks.

579
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:21,640
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as three of our elementary education staff who were accepted into DESE's Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, and Dysgraphia professional development workshops this fall.

580
00:45:22,926 --> 00:45:30,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing contacted Rebus Consultants who provided professional development on the educator evaluation tool.

581
00:45:31,154 --> 00:45:36,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Century Bank hosted our administrators offering a continental breakfast as well as a delicious lunch.

582
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:48,710
[SPEAKER_07]: We would like to extend our thanks to the Sloan family and Mr. Flynn for hosting our administrative team and especially to Lisa Evangelista for contacting

583
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:49,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Century Bank.

584
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:54,854
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've provided an agenda for you for review for each of the days.

585
00:45:55,074 --> 00:45:57,675
[SPEAKER_07]: We were really busy Monday through Friday.

586
00:45:57,695 --> 00:46:04,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Had a wonderful time at the barbecue, and I'll let Bernadette talk to you more about what she did with our new teachers.

587
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be happy to answer any questions.

588
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:08,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

589
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:09,082
[SPEAKER_11]: DiBenedetto.

590
00:46:09,703 --> 00:46:10,883
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, I want to thank you.

591
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:15,226
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not on, Erin?

592
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:17,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it on?

593
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:20,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thank you.

594
00:46:20,432 --> 00:46:27,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Over the summer, I know that there's a strong group here in works all summer through, and it's appreciated.

595
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:27,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for that.

596
00:46:27,813 --> 00:46:31,634
[SPEAKER_13]: So that when the kids come back and the teachers come back, you're ready for them.

597
00:46:31,994 --> 00:46:34,675
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have a few questions about some items that you talked about.

598
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:37,875
[SPEAKER_13]: How are our administrators evaluated?

599
00:46:38,035 --> 00:46:42,856
[SPEAKER_13]: And are they evaluated annually in a similar format to the teachers?

600
00:46:43,456 --> 00:46:46,497
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of our administrators are evaluated.

601
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:48,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli.

602
00:46:48,897 --> 00:46:56,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So it divvies up to Dr. Vincent, myself, and others who they are going to evaluate.

603
00:46:56,479 --> 00:47:02,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So for instance, elementary education is my background, so I evaluate all of the elementary principals.

604
00:47:02,941 --> 00:47:09,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also the director of Title I, so I evaluate all of the Title I staff and some literacy staff as well.

605
00:47:10,383 --> 00:47:15,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli does a wonderful job at divvying up different people.

606
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:19,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is similar to our teachers.

607
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:21,638
[SPEAKER_07]: We have formative and summative evaluations.

608
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:25,941
[SPEAKER_07]: The rubric, however, is very different for administrators.

609
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:26,362
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

610
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:31,086
[SPEAKER_13]: And your evaluations are done by the superintendent on an annual basis?

611
00:47:31,626 --> 00:47:32,047
[SPEAKER_13]: For me.

612
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:33,748
[SPEAKER_13]: For top administration?

613
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:34,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

614
00:47:34,729 --> 00:47:36,751
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's done annually in a similar rubric?

615
00:47:37,051 --> 00:47:37,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

616
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:37,832
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

617
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:41,976
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure we do it fairly for the whole district.

618
00:47:44,004 --> 00:47:54,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a few questions about specific, I got a note from a parent regarding the dyslexic reading committee and how parents might be able to join that committee.

619
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:58,390
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think Susanna Campbell is chairing that committee.

620
00:47:59,331 --> 00:48:02,472
[SPEAKER_07]: You might want to suggest that they contact her.

621
00:48:03,353 --> 00:48:03,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

622
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:06,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole Chiesa will be on that committee as well.

623
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:08,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

624
00:48:09,295 --> 00:48:12,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, you know, there was still some,

625
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:27,669
[SPEAKER_13]: some questions about evidence-based programming, but I'll speak with them directly about that, or maybe when we get after the training and you do an update to us about the training.

626
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:29,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I absolutely will do that.

627
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,150
[SPEAKER_07]: The training takes place

628
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:34,754
[SPEAKER_07]: in September, October, maybe the beginning of November.

629
00:48:35,334 --> 00:48:44,121
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hoping to do a train-the-trainers model, so there are teachers at the McGlynn that are being trained, and then they in turn will train our other elementary teachers.

630
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:47,843
[SPEAKER_13]: And how about the dyslexia evaluation?

631
00:48:48,023 --> 00:48:50,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Are those currently happening on our new kindergartners?

632
00:48:51,486 --> 00:48:52,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we purchase that?

633
00:48:53,207 --> 00:48:55,407
[SPEAKER_13]: that program, remember last year?

634
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:57,128
[SPEAKER_07]: We discussed it.

635
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,468
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't purchased a program for that yet.

636
00:48:59,928 --> 00:49:12,410
[SPEAKER_07]: We are working on a new, Desi asked certain communities to write a grant, and Susanna and myself and Nicole wrote a grant, and right now we are piloting over at the Columbus Elementary School.

637
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,131
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called MAPS Growth.

638
00:49:14,871 --> 00:49:15,511
[SPEAKER_13]: MAPS Growth?

639
00:49:15,771 --> 00:49:17,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

640
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:22,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Interestingly enough, the person in charge of this is a woman named Martha Coakley,

641
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,246
[SPEAKER_07]: from Medfield.

642
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:29,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked her if she often gets emails, and she said she does.

643
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:43,275
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, after the conversations we had last year, I thought we were implementing an evaluation for incoming kindergartners this year to evaluate where they were with dyslexia.

644
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:49,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we were going to take that until DESE provided us more information at the end of this year for the following years.

645
00:49:52,068 --> 00:49:53,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Did that, that did not happen?

646
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:54,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

647
00:49:54,089 --> 00:49:59,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to look through my notes on that, Mr. Benedetto, to see if we said we would implement a tool in September.

648
00:49:59,851 --> 00:50:03,852
[SPEAKER_07]: The Department of Education still is very unclear about what they're doing.

649
00:50:04,092 --> 00:50:17,077
[SPEAKER_13]: But this committee voted to move forward and it was between a checklist that teacher observed and checked off or an actual assessment that assessed the children.

650
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:20,324
[SPEAKER_13]: is my memory and I thought we were moving forward with this.

651
00:50:20,705 --> 00:50:23,607
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to go back and if we're not, I think we need to relook at it.

652
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:26,289
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually thought it was in the budget for this year as well.

653
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:39,520
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe the superintendent could put it on the agenda for next week and we can like talk before that next meeting and we could talk about that and make sure that we're all clear about what's happening with that.

654
00:50:40,061 --> 00:50:42,563
[SPEAKER_13]: And my last item is the new math program.

655
00:50:43,703 --> 00:51:00,730
[SPEAKER_13]: I did get some calls about that and I was a little I reached out to the superintendent about making sure El in special education teachers had a teaching book and I think that's happening, but I just want to make sure that the colored paper that the teachers need to

656
00:51:03,815 --> 00:51:08,819
[SPEAKER_13]: to operate this, and the manipulatives are available to all our students.

657
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:22,270
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would request that we put this on the agenda and have the director come forward and see how it's going so far, see if we have enough money to sustain us for all those new needs.

658
00:51:23,017 --> 00:51:28,681
[SPEAKER_13]: and the paper volume, and just maybe an update on how it's going since it's a brand new program.

659
00:51:29,101 --> 00:51:34,725
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would also suggest have an update from Rocco as well on the new science program.

660
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:37,307
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that he gets a lot of things in the mail.

661
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:42,150
[SPEAKER_13]: And I haven't heard anything from anyone about that, but I'd love to celebrate that as well.

662
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sure he would.

663
00:51:43,531 --> 00:51:43,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ms.

664
00:51:43,972 --> 00:51:46,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Khan is planning to be here next week to give you an update on the map.

665
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:47,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, perfect timing then.

666
00:51:47,934 --> 00:51:48,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

667
00:51:49,462 --> 00:51:50,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

668
00:51:51,048 --> 00:51:52,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, thank you for all the work that you've done.

669
00:51:53,255 --> 00:51:54,439
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's been a tremendous.

670
00:51:55,703 --> 00:51:56,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

671
00:51:56,462 --> 00:51:56,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

672
00:51:56,782 --> 00:51:57,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Van der Kloot.

673
00:51:58,063 --> 00:52:14,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to comment that I agree with Erin that I was under the impression that we weren't just doing a pilot program at one elementary school, but that the will of the school committee was to be very aggressive in moving.

674
00:52:14,813 --> 00:52:25,440
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some question about which would be the tool that we used, but I certainly, I wasn't thinking that we were just doing a pilot program

675
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:35,729
[SPEAKER_02]: At one school, I thought it would be that we certainly would be even if it wasn't at the beginning of the year, but it would that certainly at the very in the fall.

676
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,552
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my recollection that the school committee.

677
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:44,308
[SPEAKER_02]: really was very clear that we wanted an aggressive effort on this.

678
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:45,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll throw that in.

679
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:47,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll look through my notes and see.

680
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Superintendent would like to respond.

681
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:59,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we did say that there was a debate about which program we would work with and the timing and the training that it would require.

682
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:04,146
[SPEAKER_16]: So we and then we pursued the grant as well with the state.

683
00:53:04,627 --> 00:53:09,175
[SPEAKER_16]: So we were awarded that for one school only from the state.

684
00:53:09,535 --> 00:53:10,657
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a different program.

685
00:53:11,198 --> 00:53:12,200
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have not

686
00:53:15,142 --> 00:53:29,045
[SPEAKER_16]: begun implementing the dyslexia screening as of right now, but that is what was said in the late spring, and we'll be able to pull up those records and get them for us for next time that we meet.

687
00:53:30,286 --> 00:53:31,206
[SPEAKER_16]: What were our next steps?

688
00:53:33,406 --> 00:53:33,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yeah.

689
00:53:38,238 --> 00:53:43,921
[SPEAKER_11]: We're at the beginning of the year, so I would just also like to ask for a report about the breakfast program.

690
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:44,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

691
00:53:44,302 --> 00:53:49,204
[SPEAKER_02]: A parent approached me with concerns about

692
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:08,022
[SPEAKER_02]: She wondered what the kids were receiving to eat, because her child had come home and reported something that was concerning.

693
00:54:08,763 --> 00:54:10,043
[SPEAKER_02]: She thought perhaps two should agree.

694
00:54:11,203 --> 00:54:17,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just wanted to be clear on what the breakfast program is providing to our students.

695
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:18,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll absolutely do that.

696
00:54:18,966 --> 00:54:19,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

697
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:20,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

698
00:54:20,386 --> 00:54:20,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

699
00:54:21,347 --> 00:54:22,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. Ruggiero.

700
00:54:24,454 --> 00:54:31,177
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to get a sense of, do we have an idea of when the DESE guidelines will be coming out, or is that the state's unclear on that?

701
00:54:31,357 --> 00:54:32,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Next year, actually.

702
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:33,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a year.

703
00:54:33,298 --> 00:54:35,760
[SPEAKER_07]: The fall of next year, or winter of next year.

704
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Very little guidance from DESE.

705
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:43,144
[SPEAKER_19]: And do we have a sense, is there like a preliminary report that's going to be anticipated, or it's just all coming out at once?

706
00:54:43,164 --> 00:54:46,846
[SPEAKER_16]: There were different programs that DESE, with this particular grant,

707
00:54:48,893 --> 00:54:50,414
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if it was 20 communities.

708
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:54,417
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a limited number of communities that DESE was working with.

709
00:54:55,118 --> 00:54:58,961
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, Medford was selected to be one of those districts to pilot.

710
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:03,424
[SPEAKER_16]: So I truly believe they're going to take the data from this year of study.

711
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:08,448
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of professional development, a lot of communication with DESE.

712
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:32,222
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think as they're looking at the different communities that are piloting the different programs, based on that information, it's probably going to take at least a year to a year and a half for DESE to be able to say, based on the pilot districts and what the data yielded, which direction they're going to recommend the state moves in.

713
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:50,572
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is still going to be, there's this, I feel, a window of opportunity where even if you stop moving forward in one direction, a year's time to a year and a half, DESE could potentially say, let's course correct and start another path.

714
00:55:51,232 --> 00:55:53,714
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're kind of working with them.

715
00:55:54,547 --> 00:55:58,710
[SPEAKER_16]: and also just thinking about what our next steps need to continue to be.

716
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:05,093
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it possible that we could have one of the administrators of the program come in to speak about what their game plan and their strategy is?

717
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:10,977
[SPEAKER_19]: Because right now it seems like everyone's sort of unclear about where this is moving, and this is a very serious issue.

718
00:56:11,057 --> 00:56:16,220
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we all were very moved by the presentation that came to us about dyslexia.

719
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we are taking it seriously.

720
00:56:19,262 --> 00:56:20,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I have no doubt.

721
00:56:20,322 --> 00:56:22,404
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't mean to imply that people aren't taking it seriously.

722
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:31,870
[SPEAKER_19]: It would just be helpful to me when people call me about the issue that I have more to report other than Desi is trying a bunch of stuff out in some different communities and we'll see in a year and a half.

723
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:44,969
[SPEAKER_16]: I can definitely try to reach out to DESE to see if they would be able to come and talk about where they are with the status of dyslexia or what it is, how they're gathering the data.

724
00:56:44,989 --> 00:56:46,270
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can definitely work on that.

725
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:52,214
[SPEAKER_19]: If they can't, send a personnel member, at least something they can write us, so at least we have a sense of what's going on.

726
00:56:52,635 --> 00:56:54,596
[SPEAKER_19]: And I really appreciate both of you following up on it.

727
00:56:54,616 --> 00:56:55,076
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

728
00:56:57,518 --> 00:56:58,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

729
00:56:58,690 --> 00:56:59,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

730
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:09,454
[SPEAKER_13]: I do remember that us being hesitant to buy something, but most of the programs that you're going to buy, you're going to use them for the kindergarten.

731
00:57:09,494 --> 00:57:16,836
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why we weren't going to wait for DESE to make their decision, because we as a committee felt it was too important.

732
00:57:17,731 --> 00:57:22,073
[SPEAKER_13]: to move forward and then we'll alter it as we need to.

733
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:33,957
[SPEAKER_13]: But my understanding was every kindergartner at this grade, at this year, was going to be tested and we weren't waiting because we don't want, that was a priority.

734
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,978
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you come forward, just please keep that in mind.

735
00:57:36,998 --> 00:57:45,662
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanna say, if my memory serves me correctly, and I need to go back and find that, I wanna say it was going to be the early fall.

736
00:57:45,682 --> 00:57:46,342
[SPEAKER_16]: We were waiting.

737
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:56,793
[SPEAKER_16]: for the kindergarten students to get the preliminary baseline screening, letter recognition, et cetera, to start the year off, and that the dyslexia screening was going to happen at the end

738
00:57:57,323 --> 00:58:01,185
[SPEAKER_16]: of like the first term around that point in time.

739
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:07,889
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll definitely be able to gather that information and represent it to you or put it in your packets for you.

740
00:58:08,329 --> 00:58:08,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

741
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:09,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

742
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:13,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

743
00:58:13,272 --> 00:58:14,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Vander Kloof, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

744
00:58:14,773 --> 00:58:15,473
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

745
00:58:15,514 --> 00:58:15,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

746
00:58:16,254 --> 00:58:16,994
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

747
00:58:18,235 --> 00:58:18,735
[SPEAKER_11]: It's granted.

748
00:58:19,976 --> 00:58:22,918
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll report on teacher induction week, Dr. Riccadeli.

749
00:58:27,722 --> 00:58:32,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, and members of the Medford School Committee.

750
00:58:34,085 --> 00:58:41,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here tonight to deliver a report on the new teacher induction program that occurred between August 19th and 23rd.

751
00:58:42,128 --> 00:58:44,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So as Diane Caldwell mentioned, that was a very busy week.

752
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:51,853
[SPEAKER_06]: We had two very busy concurrently run programs running on campus at the high school.

753
00:58:52,473 --> 00:59:02,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So the new teacher induction program was designed to introduce to our 48 new educators in the district, policies and procedures.

754
00:59:02,861 --> 00:59:07,064
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to familiarize them with the curricular programs and technological applications.

755
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:15,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And most importantly, we wanted to acclimate them to Medford as a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community.

756
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:25,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing that I noticed through the week is on that first day, and there were several of you there on that first day, and that room was really quiet, you could feel the tension, people were really nervous.

757
00:59:25,615 --> 00:59:35,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to tell you that as the week progressed, by Friday, you could see that relationships had formed, that people relaxed, and people were really feeling a connection to

758
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:37,332
[SPEAKER_06]: to the district.

759
00:59:37,412 --> 00:59:39,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So that I think was very welcome.

760
00:59:41,157 --> 00:59:45,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I did see a lot of growth with the new staff during that week.

761
00:59:47,378 --> 00:59:51,401
[SPEAKER_06]: So we provided a lot of different activities.

762
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:54,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you know, it was a five-day induction program.

763
00:59:55,623 --> 01:00:15,917
[SPEAKER_06]: New staff participated in workshops on a variety of topics that included the use of technology and technology portals, mentoring, support, and guidance, educator evaluation process and expectations, sexual harassment awareness, curriculum and best instructional practices, social emotional learning,

764
01:00:16,437 --> 01:00:17,958
[SPEAKER_06]: and a safety care training.

765
01:00:18,338 --> 01:00:26,520
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've also included an agenda for all five days of the district, and as you can see, all of the different activities that occurred.

766
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was comprehensive.

767
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:36,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year we did a four-day training and gave teachers the fifth day as a classroom prep day.

768
01:00:37,223 --> 01:00:41,425
[SPEAKER_06]: This year we embedded classroom preparation in throughout the week.

769
01:00:42,546 --> 01:00:51,256
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanted to make it so that they would have support from their curriculum director, their building principal, and their mentor at the different times that they had their classroom preparation.

770
01:00:52,558 --> 01:00:53,940
[SPEAKER_06]: One new thing that we added

771
01:00:54,493 --> 01:01:00,139
[SPEAKER_06]: This year was a tour of Medford, and I will report that it was a success.

772
01:01:00,179 --> 01:01:04,204
[SPEAKER_06]: The anecdotal evidence to date has been very, very positive.

773
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:06,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot take the credit myself.

774
01:01:06,846 --> 01:01:16,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to thank Lisa Evangelista, and although not noted in the report, Nick Tucci had the idea, and I wish he was still here, but I do want to give him credit.

775
01:01:16,717 --> 01:01:20,599
[SPEAKER_06]: He said to me back in the spring, did you ever think about doing a tour of Medford?

776
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:22,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought it was a great idea.

777
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,621
[SPEAKER_06]: We were able to make it happen this year.

778
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:27,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I want to thank Lisa Evangelista.

779
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:32,925
[SPEAKER_06]: She made the calls to the Royal House, to Tufts University, to Colleen's.

780
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:38,848
[SPEAKER_06]: to Dominic Camara, who helped fund the ice cream at Colleen's, to Lakasha's.

781
01:01:39,508 --> 01:01:42,812
[SPEAKER_06]: She did a wonderful job narrating the tour.

782
01:01:42,952 --> 01:01:46,396
[SPEAKER_06]: She has a strong knowledge of the history of Medford.

783
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a social studies teacher.

784
01:01:49,098 --> 01:01:52,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to think my knowledge of Medford history is pretty strong.

785
01:01:52,902 --> 01:01:53,983
[SPEAKER_06]: not compared to Lisa.

786
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:58,947
[SPEAKER_06]: She had all of the anecdotal stories along with the real history to go with it.

787
01:01:59,407 --> 01:02:03,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that the new educators were really, they appreciated that.

788
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:10,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to make, I just want to make sure I give everyone credit here, so I mentioned Tufts University.

789
01:02:10,656 --> 01:02:20,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Rocco DiRico, who is at Tufts and his team, did an extraordinary job putting on a presentation and informing

790
01:02:21,443 --> 01:02:24,045
[SPEAKER_06]: the new staff and to us.

791
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know all that they did.

792
01:02:25,706 --> 01:02:29,188
[SPEAKER_06]: The outreach to the Medford community and all the resources that they have available.

793
01:02:30,728 --> 01:02:34,190
[SPEAKER_06]: They provided coffee and pastries and really made us feel welcome.

794
01:02:35,271 --> 01:02:38,013
[SPEAKER_06]: LaCosche's, what a wonderful welcome they gave us.

795
01:02:38,073 --> 01:02:39,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, an open arm welcome.

796
01:02:39,814 --> 01:02:40,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Medford.

797
01:02:41,214 --> 01:02:42,095
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very nice.

798
01:02:43,536 --> 01:02:44,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Colleen's the same thing.

799
01:02:46,037 --> 01:02:54,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Joseph's Transportation donated a bus at a very minimal cost to the district, so we were able to travel in comfort.

800
01:02:55,184 --> 01:02:56,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It was warm that day.

801
01:02:56,245 --> 01:02:57,406
[SPEAKER_06]: The bus was air conditioned.

802
01:02:57,946 --> 01:03:02,590
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the speaker, so Lisa was able to narrate the tour, and everyone was able to hear her.

803
01:03:03,407 --> 01:03:06,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something that I'm hoping we can continue in the future.

804
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:13,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to acknowledge Starbucks and West Medford for their contribution of coffee.

805
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:23,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Goldilocks Bagels, which I'm not sure if they've opened yet, but they were still practicing and they donated a lot of bagels to us.

806
01:03:23,899 --> 01:03:25,961
[SPEAKER_06]: The bagels were extraordinary, I must say.

807
01:03:26,381 --> 01:03:31,484
[SPEAKER_06]: And also for Wegmans for their generous donation of coffee and other treats

808
01:03:32,432 --> 01:03:35,035
[SPEAKER_06]: for the group throughout the induction program week.

809
01:03:35,455 --> 01:03:46,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I like to think that this program was balanced between process, procedure, people, and again, acclimating people to feel comfortable.

810
01:03:47,688 --> 01:03:49,670
[SPEAKER_06]: and to be part of the Medford community.

811
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:51,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

812
01:03:52,091 --> 01:03:53,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Dr. Riccadeli.

813
01:03:53,893 --> 01:03:54,273
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

814
01:03:54,533 --> 01:03:58,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file by Mr. Rousseau, seconded by Ms.

815
01:03:58,776 --> 01:03:59,377
[SPEAKER_11]: DiBenedetto?

816
01:03:59,397 --> 01:04:00,157
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

817
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:01,658
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

818
01:04:01,718 --> 01:04:02,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

819
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:09,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, report on buildings and grounds, summer updates, Mr. McLaughlin.

820
01:04:11,626 --> 01:04:11,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

821
01:04:11,826 --> 01:04:13,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz, did you want to speak on something?

822
01:04:13,967 --> 01:04:14,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

823
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, for John, okay.

824
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:18,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it for John?

825
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

826
01:04:21,894 --> 01:04:22,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. McLaughlin.

827
01:04:23,175 --> 01:04:26,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, committee.

828
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:34,904
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I'm always grateful for the support that we receive in Buildings and Grounds and this year was certainly no different.

829
01:04:37,126 --> 01:04:44,152
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll start and I'll run through what we have been up to in some of the buildings and I'll take questions if you have any.

830
01:04:46,086 --> 01:04:53,915
[SPEAKER_15]: So at the Andrews School, with the help of the mayor's office, we were able to start to replace all of the.

831
01:04:55,226 --> 01:04:59,249
[SPEAKER_15]: the corroded cement curbing with the granite.

832
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:04,474
[SPEAKER_15]: And the DPW did a fantastic job helping us out down there.

833
01:05:05,655 --> 01:05:09,798
[SPEAKER_15]: We also worked over at the McGlynn School as well.

834
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:18,786
[SPEAKER_15]: And we had all the upholstery shampooed in the library and all the furniture this past summer.

835
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:31,295
[SPEAKER_15]: As well as we have the gym's floors screened and varnished, as well as the custodians obviously doing a good job with the regular everyday summer type of cleaning that we perform.

836
01:05:32,656 --> 01:05:44,285
[SPEAKER_15]: The Brooks Elementary School, we're just about finished with the capital HVAC project that we've been up to over there, and we'll be getting that online very soon.

837
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:50,524
[SPEAKER_15]: And we had all of the rugs in every single classroom as well as the library shampooed this year.

838
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:57,348
[SPEAKER_15]: The gym floors were refinished and the forestry department, we had

839
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:00,663
[SPEAKER_15]: a slight issue with some birds getting into some of the vents.

840
01:06:01,243 --> 01:06:07,766
[SPEAKER_15]: So between the forestry department, the electric department, our maintenance department, the custodians, we were able to climb up there.

841
01:06:07,786 --> 01:06:14,088
[SPEAKER_15]: We get up in the bucket and we were able to excavate the birds and put up screens.

842
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:15,689
[SPEAKER_15]: So hopefully that doesn't happen again.

843
01:06:15,749 --> 01:06:23,352
[SPEAKER_15]: But that was certainly a health concern that we had for the kids and that we wanted to make sure that we did the best we could to rectify it.

844
01:06:24,293 --> 01:06:27,674
[SPEAKER_15]: And over at the Columbus, the compressors were replaced.

845
01:06:28,606 --> 01:06:29,946
[SPEAKER_15]: The gym floor is refinished.

846
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:33,207
[SPEAKER_15]: We had the roofer in doing maintenance as well this summer.

847
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:37,468
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have an issue in one of the offices.

848
01:06:37,548 --> 01:06:38,768
[SPEAKER_15]: It's getting a little bit of moisture.

849
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:41,869
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to be in the process of adding a sump pump.

850
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:44,109
[SPEAKER_15]: It was an office that's kind of underground.

851
01:06:44,669 --> 01:06:47,310
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was getting some moisture that was creating an issue.

852
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:49,911
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to be on that very, very soon.

853
01:06:50,551 --> 01:06:53,791
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had the DAU computer replaced at the Columbus.

854
01:06:53,851 --> 01:06:54,712
[SPEAKER_15]: It went down today.

855
01:06:56,904 --> 01:07:17,473
[SPEAKER_15]: film time, it's back up and running, so we'll keep a keen eye on that to make sure that we get that running, because we will, after the compressor project is completed, we'll have a punch list in the schools, in the various rooms, in the set points that we'll be running through, you know, to get everything back to original standards.

856
01:07:18,593 --> 01:07:20,794
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, let's see.

857
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:23,075
[SPEAKER_15]: So at the McGlynn School,

858
01:07:24,894 --> 01:07:27,576
[SPEAKER_15]: We had the roofing contractor down there too doing maintenance.

859
01:07:28,396 --> 01:07:35,500
[SPEAKER_15]: And obviously the project from the mayor's office that we're replacing the granite curbing.

860
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:44,665
[SPEAKER_15]: We did finally get everybody together and get that slide in place down there, which was certainly one that the community had some interest in.

861
01:07:44,745 --> 01:07:46,006
[SPEAKER_15]: And we-

862
01:07:49,568 --> 01:08:03,180
[SPEAKER_15]: I know and I mean what people may not understand is that there's like one guy on the East Coast that does it and he was in Nantucket all summer putting together doing a big project so we were finally able to get him up here and

863
01:08:04,432 --> 01:08:08,196
[SPEAKER_15]: And then when we were putting it in, there's a little bit of a drainage issue down there.

864
01:08:08,276 --> 01:08:10,518
[SPEAKER_15]: So the water kept filling up with water.

865
01:08:10,598 --> 01:08:11,999
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're trying to mount it.

866
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:15,002
[SPEAKER_15]: But we stayed on it.

867
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:20,046
[SPEAKER_15]: And then that was another one that the DPW and the parks department really came in.

868
01:08:21,127 --> 01:08:22,648
[SPEAKER_15]: came in handy for that one.

869
01:08:22,688 --> 01:08:27,552
[SPEAKER_15]: They seem to really help us out a lot when we need help.

870
01:08:28,193 --> 01:08:39,481
[SPEAKER_15]: So we did end up getting that and we had the gym floor done but they missed the small gym and we're going to do that next week as well as we're going to do the theater.

871
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:43,764
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to screen and re-varnish the floors in the theater which will make it look nice.

872
01:08:44,325 --> 01:08:44,925
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the

873
01:08:45,986 --> 01:08:47,566
[SPEAKER_15]: The seating project's been delayed.

874
01:08:47,947 --> 01:08:58,409
[SPEAKER_15]: They may not be able to get there till October because of the fact that the 16-week lead time on the upholstery for the chairs that we're going to be replacing.

875
01:08:58,489 --> 01:09:00,990
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're still pushing forward.

876
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:04,310
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we would move on to the Roberts.

877
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:05,631
[SPEAKER_15]: So they have the compressors.

878
01:09:05,651 --> 01:09:06,411
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been completed.

879
01:09:06,451 --> 01:09:07,731
[SPEAKER_15]: We're working on punch list.

880
01:09:08,551 --> 01:09:11,312
[SPEAKER_15]: The rugs in the gym floors were done as well over there.

881
01:09:12,632 --> 01:09:14,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Curtis Tufts, we were able to move in and do another one

882
01:09:17,294 --> 01:09:22,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Floors we stripped off the 80-year-old varnish and we were in there working in there.

883
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:24,977
[SPEAKER_15]: So that worked out well.

884
01:09:25,657 --> 01:09:32,240
[SPEAKER_15]: But Buildings and Grounds is very grateful for the help they'll receive.

885
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:38,703
[SPEAKER_15]: And people in the community and the school committee and everybody understands the value of maintenance.

886
01:09:39,323 --> 01:09:44,105
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're allowed to do these projects with the support of everybody.

887
01:09:44,565 --> 01:09:57,179
[SPEAKER_15]: And Brian Karens and Steve Tanaglia, Mike Nesta, Steve Randazzo in the Electoral Department, Vinny in the Electoral Department, the custodians that are in the trenches every day.

888
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:03,966
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know I mentioned the DPW and them a lot, but they do, they help us all the time, anytime we need.

889
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,655
[SPEAKER_15]: anything on the outside, the forestry department was at Medford High School.

890
01:10:08,035 --> 01:10:17,521
[SPEAKER_15]: We were able to trim some trees to get some good security angles with cameras that we were really, really pushing to do that as well.

891
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:21,664
[SPEAKER_15]: And we had some landscaping done up the high school as well.

892
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:25,747
[SPEAKER_15]: We had the front where the sign is all redone.

893
01:10:26,427 --> 01:10:30,730
[SPEAKER_15]: The kiddie area that's in the west courtyard, it was all kind of grass.

894
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:36,034
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had them come in and we had them scrape it down and put in the kid cushion mulch.

895
01:10:36,494 --> 01:10:43,519
[SPEAKER_15]: So now they're all set on that side too, which was, that was a good project too, that needed to be done.

896
01:10:43,559 --> 01:10:43,999
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?

897
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:49,083
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just all part of what we need to do, you know, on a daily basis.

898
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:52,986
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'd like to take any questions if anybody has any.

899
01:10:53,341 --> 01:10:55,222
[SPEAKER_11]: I also just want to add a couple of comments.

900
01:10:55,762 --> 01:10:59,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Three applications are made to the CPC, the CPA commission.

901
01:11:00,524 --> 01:11:04,786
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the playground at the Brooks, the Columbus, and at the McGlynn Complex.

902
01:11:04,826 --> 01:11:07,148
[SPEAKER_11]: So three applications went in from the school department.

903
01:11:07,608 --> 01:11:08,308
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe, Ms.

904
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:13,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Patterson, the final application is due in a week or so.

905
01:11:14,231 --> 01:11:17,512
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to make sure that that gets in on time.

906
01:11:17,552 --> 01:11:19,513
[SPEAKER_11]: But those already went through the preliminary process.

907
01:11:19,533 --> 01:11:19,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

908
01:11:19,773 --> 01:11:21,954
[SPEAKER_11]: And as soon as we hear back.

909
01:11:23,764 --> 01:11:26,429
[SPEAKER_11]: we will determine next steps for those three projects as well.

910
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, John.

911
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:42,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for the very comprehensive report and thanks for getting back to me during the summer with different text messages that I sent you with pictures.

912
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:57,182
[SPEAKER_04]: You did a great job and everything looks really great and I also want to thank the DPW because I actually sent Steve Tenaglia a couple of messages and he took care of things immediately and it was really, really appreciated.

913
01:11:58,203 --> 01:12:13,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a question because I was comparing this report to the to the year one from the capital improvement plan and Everything was going along and I was checking everything off and so there was a couple of items one of them was the Curtis Tufts the front steel well replacement and

914
01:12:14,312 --> 01:12:26,120
[SPEAKER_15]: And did- Well, what we found, and I was speaking to Mayor Burke earlier, what we found was the money that we lauded for the project wasn't even close to what it's going to cost to do the project.

915
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:36,107
[SPEAKER_15]: So we spoke about getting some quotes, and then we'll look at it from there and see where we can go with it.

916
01:12:36,187 --> 01:12:39,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we can fit it in this time around.

917
01:12:39,509 --> 01:12:43,192
[SPEAKER_15]: When we have a good number to shoot for,

918
01:12:44,992 --> 01:12:47,793
[SPEAKER_15]: we'll see if we can fit it in for the next time around, I hope.

919
01:12:49,034 --> 01:12:52,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything dangerous, like where somebody could trip on the snow?

920
01:12:52,175 --> 01:12:52,875
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

921
01:12:52,995 --> 01:13:00,658
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, it's functional, but it's not necessarily aesthetically pleasing to a certain degree.

922
01:13:00,678 --> 01:13:01,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

923
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:02,699
[SPEAKER_04]: No safety.

924
01:13:02,759 --> 01:13:03,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

925
01:13:03,459 --> 01:13:03,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

926
01:13:04,219 --> 01:13:11,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And, oh, and then I did, you know, just recently I was asking about the, also was the,

927
01:13:12,049 --> 01:13:14,571
[SPEAKER_04]: repair the fire alarm system.

928
01:13:14,871 --> 01:13:16,572
[SPEAKER_04]: That was originally in our year one.

929
01:13:17,152 --> 01:13:27,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know, I don't know if Christine Patterson wanted to come up and just explain that, that it was, so this is our plan, but it wasn't, all of this wasn't approved in the free cash.

930
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:28,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?

931
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:37,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like, I, I guess I forgot that, you know, that part of it, that it's just a plan, but we're not guaranteed to get those fundings.

932
01:13:37,727 --> 01:13:38,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes that's correct.

933
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:54,932
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we went through the process of identifying a five year capital plan we were identifying and incorporating areas that as the school department we wanted to put on a list that would then be going to city council for approval.

934
01:13:55,452 --> 01:14:02,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Again our list was very comprehensive very thorough does not mean that that equates to funding.

935
01:14:02,994 --> 01:14:06,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not mean that that is absolute absolute.

936
01:14:06,735 --> 01:14:07,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a plan.

937
01:14:08,132 --> 01:14:15,134
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have to get the funds approved through free cash process and then approved from city council.

938
01:14:15,574 --> 01:14:24,838
[SPEAKER_05]: So although we may have a plan for $2 million in a capital repair, that does not mean that $2 million is going to be issued.

939
01:14:25,118 --> 01:14:30,219
[SPEAKER_05]: That's indicating that we have identified the need for such capital repairs.

940
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:36,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it's a balancing act for the city's funding and what is available through free cash.

941
01:14:38,662 --> 01:14:44,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal year 20, again, even though the fiscal year has started, we have not gotten free cash certified.

942
01:14:44,871 --> 01:14:50,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, we cannot even request to get any funding for these second year projects until that occurs.

943
01:14:51,214 --> 01:15:04,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the natural course, it's the natural process that occurs each year that we need to get DOR certification and then the balancing act of which projects are going to be funded from city and school side.

944
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:13,544
[SPEAKER_05]: So our capital plan was submitted as a plan identifying the needs coming up for the school buildings.

945
01:15:13,944 --> 01:15:18,206
[SPEAKER_11]: So Aleesha Nunley is in the process of closing the books for the municipality.

946
01:15:18,266 --> 01:15:20,647
[SPEAKER_11]: And once they're closed, they get submitted to DOR.

947
01:15:21,103 --> 01:15:23,884
[SPEAKER_11]: and then they certify the free cash from the prior year.

948
01:15:24,384 --> 01:15:26,145
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're in like a hold pattern right now.

949
01:15:26,265 --> 01:15:33,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully October we'll get notification of our free cash allotment and that's when we can submit papers to the council from free cash.

950
01:15:34,049 --> 01:15:35,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

951
01:15:35,529 --> 01:15:35,809
Okay.

952
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:37,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

953
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:37,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all set.

954
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:38,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

955
01:15:38,311 --> 01:15:39,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, John.

956
01:15:40,171 --> 01:15:41,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

957
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:42,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

958
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:43,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Van der Kloot.

959
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:45,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a clarification then.

960
01:15:46,272 --> 01:15:54,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So each of the projects that we put in the capital plan from now on will be brought forth one by one?

961
01:15:55,615 --> 01:15:56,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not.

962
01:15:56,456 --> 01:16:01,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Once free cash is certified, we'll probably accumulate a few projects and put them forth.

963
01:16:01,498 --> 01:16:07,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the playgrounds, we're waiting for the CPC committee to make its motions of approval.

964
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,361
[SPEAKER_11]: And that goes to city council as well.

965
01:16:09,581 --> 01:16:11,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have an understanding of when that would be?

966
01:16:12,397 --> 01:16:12,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Free cash?

967
01:16:13,378 --> 01:16:15,579
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the CPC process.

968
01:16:15,619 --> 01:16:16,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe, is it October?

969
01:16:17,721 --> 01:16:20,403
[SPEAKER_11]: They're waiting for the final applications next week?

970
01:16:20,563 --> 01:16:25,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, and then I believe the allocations will be going forward for the spring funding amount.

971
01:16:27,037 --> 01:16:34,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So no possible, we're not moving forward on any of the playgrounds till next spring, even though they were in year two of our plan.

972
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:45,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we, you know, I guess part of me thought that we're just going out to bond for money come into this.

973
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:49,947
[SPEAKER_11]: To the extent we're able to get it through CPC, it's less bonding for the community.

974
01:16:50,407 --> 01:16:53,449
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's coming out of the pockets of monies that we've already collected.

975
01:16:55,672 --> 01:16:56,553
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an allocation.

976
01:16:56,593 --> 01:16:57,053
[SPEAKER_11]: It really is.

977
01:16:57,093 --> 01:16:59,874
[SPEAKER_11]: When you look at a whole spreadsheet, it's coming from different pockets.

978
01:16:59,934 --> 01:17:13,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the Columbus School for the Welcome to Kindergarten students, and though I've been there many times looking at the playground surface, I was truly taken aback at how bad it had gotten.

979
01:17:15,519 --> 01:17:21,423
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was thinking that we were going to be able to be moving on these much sooner than now.

980
01:17:21,563 --> 01:17:28,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Money coming up in the spring, and we all know what that means, is the projects aren't really going to happen maybe until next summer.

981
01:17:28,808 --> 01:17:33,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, I just think it's, I mean, at some point there's a question of what is the safety level of our

982
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:35,772
[SPEAKER_02]: playgrounds.

983
01:17:36,932 --> 01:17:38,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a good number of years that they're there now.

984
01:17:39,634 --> 01:17:41,495
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not meant to last forever.

985
01:17:41,635 --> 01:17:42,075
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't.

986
01:17:43,035 --> 01:17:47,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And so quite honestly, I'm really disappointed that we're not moving more aggressively on this.

987
01:17:47,798 --> 01:17:49,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that there's these funds.

988
01:17:50,224 --> 01:17:59,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess part of me feels like, well, we ought to have a plan B. We ought to be thinking of a plan B now in case we don't get funded for all of those plan grants.

989
01:17:59,589 --> 01:18:01,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course there will be a plan B if we don't get the money.

990
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:09,193
[SPEAKER_11]: But we are not going to jump to plan B before we hear on plan A. And if they move sooner than later, we can get this in the pipeline.

991
01:18:09,413 --> 01:18:12,895
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe the Roberts took them about a week to do.

992
01:18:13,075 --> 01:18:15,176
[SPEAKER_11]: So it could be over a school vacation week as well.

993
01:18:15,576 --> 01:18:17,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Once we get approval, we can move.

994
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:20,130
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

995
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:20,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

996
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:20,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

997
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:21,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

998
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

999
01:18:23,951 --> 01:18:27,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, thank you for the update on the CPA requests.

1000
01:18:27,652 --> 01:18:34,674
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to ask that, um, John, thank you for you and your team for all the work that you do, not only through the summer, but through the whole year.

1001
01:18:34,894 --> 01:18:36,015
[SPEAKER_13]: It's greatly appreciated.

1002
01:18:36,035 --> 01:18:37,315
[SPEAKER_15]: The clock never stops ticking.

1003
01:18:37,355 --> 01:18:37,875
[SPEAKER_15]: That's for sure.

1004
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:43,677
[SPEAKER_15]: So now that I, now we're coming into winter season, so we got a whole new, uh, battle to rage.

1005
01:18:44,157 --> 01:18:52,078
[SPEAKER_13]: So now that I have you smiling, can we get all the rugs cleaned in all the classrooms at all the schools and not just the Brook?

1006
01:18:52,098 --> 01:18:53,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they do the libraries and stuff like that.

1007
01:18:54,039 --> 01:18:57,319
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if we can get a tally on who has them, that's really where it comes down to.

1008
01:18:57,339 --> 01:18:59,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially the kindergarten rugs.

1009
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,760
[SPEAKER_13]: We've heard over the years how important that is.

1010
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,601
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we're doing it for one school, they probably all need them.

1011
01:19:05,621 --> 01:19:05,921
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

1012
01:19:06,221 --> 01:19:06,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Without a doubt.

1013
01:19:06,841 --> 01:19:06,901
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1014
01:19:07,021 --> 01:19:08,401
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's an easy one.

1015
01:19:08,922 --> 01:19:11,182
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll get you saying yes to things.

1016
01:19:11,948 --> 01:19:16,113
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, as long as you guys okay the funds, we'll do whatever anybody wants.

1017
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:23,680
[SPEAKER_13]: The Curtis Tufts, can we get our friends to come in over the holidays and over the breaks to continue the painting that happened?

1018
01:19:24,477 --> 01:19:29,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I can certainly, yeah, I can certainly request that through the parks department, Mike Nesta.

1019
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, absolutely.

1020
01:19:30,921 --> 01:19:35,764
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would be great if we could finish painting that building and spruce that up.

1021
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:41,808
[SPEAKER_13]: So since we're not doing the stairs there, I'm sure there are a lot of needs in that building.

1022
01:19:41,848 --> 01:19:46,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we allocate those funds that were for the front stairs to something else in that building?

1023
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:50,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there are a lot of needs there and sometimes that building's forgotten.

1024
01:19:52,274 --> 01:19:53,475
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be Christine.

1025
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,766
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that building is cared for well.

1026
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1027
01:19:58,467 --> 01:20:00,050
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the main plan.

1028
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:03,295
[SPEAKER_05]: However, this was part of a free cash item.

1029
01:20:03,775 --> 01:20:06,379
[SPEAKER_05]: The air handler units had some additional

1030
01:20:08,112 --> 01:20:26,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Disrepair that needed to be accommodated so that particular funding has been utilized for the capital improvements that we had in year one So that that would be we would have to look at another funding source in terms of just just beautification of that that space

1031
01:20:27,485 --> 01:20:35,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, in general, though, that school is looking very worn, and it's a face of Medford, and it needs some help.

1032
01:20:35,934 --> 01:20:38,637
[SPEAKER_13]: It needs some Medford Mustang banners.

1033
01:20:38,777 --> 01:20:39,919
[SPEAKER_13]: It needs some pizazz.

1034
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:43,182
[SPEAKER_13]: You painted the sign out front, and you keep it very nice.

1035
01:20:43,563 --> 01:20:45,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe some more plantings.

1036
01:20:45,565 --> 01:20:48,408
[SPEAKER_13]: It needs attention as well as the other buildings in the school.

1037
01:20:48,808 --> 01:20:52,473
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually, that's really at the beginning of MedFed.

1038
01:20:52,834 --> 01:20:58,282
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the face, the welcome of MedFed, and it should stand out that it's part of our public school system.

1039
01:20:58,342 --> 01:21:04,451
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would really recommend some more love and care given to our Tufts, and I'm always gonna advocate for that.

1040
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:12,238
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they got the new shades, the floors are getting done, and they look beautiful when they're done.

1041
01:21:14,983 --> 01:21:20,772
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you've done them, and I know it's a lot of labor to do that, and I appreciate that.

1042
01:21:21,364 --> 01:21:26,508
[SPEAKER_13]: And I appreciate all the years that the last few years really updates have been happening in there.

1043
01:21:26,828 --> 01:21:29,911
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd just like to continue that and make sure that that school.

1044
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,432
[SPEAKER_15]: It certainly takes time.

1045
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:41,800
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's, you know, we're taking care of projects that were in the pipeline for a while and we just keep trying to chip away at it.

1046
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:42,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1047
01:21:43,072 --> 01:21:44,253
[SPEAKER_13]: I have two more questions.

1048
01:21:44,393 --> 01:21:47,174
[SPEAKER_13]: The first is the more moisture issue at the Columbus.

1049
01:21:47,554 --> 01:21:49,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it in an office that's currently occupied?

1050
01:21:50,036 --> 01:21:51,697
[SPEAKER_13]: And if, uh, is it safe?

1051
01:21:51,877 --> 01:21:52,997
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that's my question.

1052
01:21:53,037 --> 01:21:54,198
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not occupied.

1053
01:21:54,258 --> 01:21:55,879
[SPEAKER_15]: It is safe, but it's not occupied.

1054
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,560
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, it's not in the area where children are.

1055
01:21:58,941 --> 01:22:10,847
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's in the, um, if you're looking at the front of the Columbus school, the bottom right, there's a, there's a hill, there's a little corner office in there and we've been getting a little bit of moisture seeping in there.

1056
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,447
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a company coming in.

1057
01:22:14,467 --> 01:22:15,528
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to dig it.

1058
01:22:15,608 --> 01:22:18,792
[SPEAKER_15]: We were in there this summer with Mike Nestor's crew.

1059
01:22:19,133 --> 01:22:20,635
[SPEAKER_15]: And we dug a hole.

1060
01:22:20,655 --> 01:22:21,496
[SPEAKER_15]: And we took a hose.

1061
01:22:21,556 --> 01:22:23,959
[SPEAKER_15]: And we sprayed it for like two hours.

1062
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:25,581
[SPEAKER_15]: And it didn't come through.

1063
01:22:26,302 --> 01:22:29,626
[SPEAKER_15]: But you can see on the other side that, you know,

1064
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:49,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Whenever it did come through it did so we're not a hundred percent sure how why so we're gonna dig it out We're gonna put a membrane in against the wall as well as a French drain inside there with a sump pump in case anything happens to Just to alleviate that concern that we had with them with the moisture around getting in there.

1065
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:57,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay in the inside Area will be cleaned up in yeah, we're gonna be taking out parts of walls and replacing them and

1066
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:00,459
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's contained to that one little area.

1067
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:01,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly, yeah.

1068
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,582
[SPEAKER_15]: We had an air quality test that came out pretty well last week actually.

1069
01:23:05,602 --> 01:23:07,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I just want to make sure it's safe.

1070
01:23:07,202 --> 01:23:07,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

1071
01:23:09,063 --> 01:23:10,164
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure you do too.

1072
01:23:10,484 --> 01:23:16,447
[SPEAKER_13]: And then my last one is could we get an update on the curbing and all of that that happened?

1073
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:21,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that under you, or was that DPW?

1074
01:23:21,465 --> 01:23:25,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the DPW, they were working on it.

1075
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:29,952
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that there's still some more granite down there that they have plans for.

1076
01:23:29,972 --> 01:23:31,874
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a question that school started.

1077
01:23:31,894 --> 01:23:32,814
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to dig.

1078
01:23:37,718 --> 01:23:43,339
[SPEAKER_15]: I assume that some point during a vacation break or something they'll get back to it.

1079
01:23:43,399 --> 01:23:54,702
[SPEAKER_15]: But the main parts that we had the very much, we had the concerns for, which was where kids stepping off buses and things of that.

1080
01:23:54,902 --> 01:24:00,143
[SPEAKER_15]: And parent parking area, I mean parent drop off areas has all been replaced.

1081
01:24:00,723 --> 01:24:03,664
[SPEAKER_15]: And they also did sidewalk panels down there as well.

1082
01:24:04,382 --> 01:24:10,544
[SPEAKER_15]: And they did a little bit of asphalt where they put the 3D crosswalk in today.

1083
01:24:10,964 --> 01:24:13,285
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the way, we're going to have that painted as well.

1084
01:24:13,645 --> 01:24:17,266
[SPEAKER_15]: The other crosswalks that we were concerned about, they're going to be painted.

1085
01:24:17,286 --> 01:24:20,967
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he was going to do them tonight, Steve, and the DPW crew.

1086
01:24:20,987 --> 01:24:23,648
[SPEAKER_15]: We're supposed to do them tonight, but we'll see.

1087
01:24:23,728 --> 01:24:25,129
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see how it worked out.

1088
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:28,450
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, they're supposed to paint up the crosswalks.

1089
01:24:29,154 --> 01:24:34,378
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we last left our meeting, I thought we were getting that machine in that does the cement.

1090
01:24:34,398 --> 01:24:37,761
[SPEAKER_11]: The machine would not work because the road was not level.

1091
01:24:38,562 --> 01:24:42,164
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you have a brand new road that's perfectly level, the machine is beautiful.

1092
01:24:42,405 --> 01:24:45,767
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you have a road that's not, it doesn't work.

1093
01:24:45,787 --> 01:24:46,768
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say thank you.

1094
01:24:46,788 --> 01:24:48,830
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it works better with asphalt, too.

1095
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:52,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I asked them if they could give us an asphalt berm.

1096
01:24:53,391 --> 01:25:02,537
[SPEAKER_15]: at the Brooks in between the play area and the pathway, because sometimes the rain rushes down and then it gets on the new field.

1097
01:25:02,577 --> 01:25:04,719
[SPEAKER_15]: So they were going to do that when they get a chance.

1098
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:07,640
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we all know how busy they are.

1099
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:12,644
[SPEAKER_13]: So did all schools get the granite curbing that needed them?

1100
01:25:13,145 --> 01:25:22,233
[SPEAKER_15]: The only schools right now we've been working on is the McGlynn and Andrews Complex because that was the one that was needed to be done the most.

1101
01:25:22,453 --> 01:25:29,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Not saying that Columbus may have a few areas, any of the other buildings that have cement curbing.

1102
01:25:30,019 --> 01:25:37,425
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, however it happened, I'm sure it was much more expensive, but it was a great need for the school community.

1103
01:25:38,806 --> 01:25:42,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it being done, as well as many teachers.

1104
01:25:42,248 --> 01:25:44,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we'll never have to revisit it again.

1105
01:25:44,669 --> 01:25:52,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Once now, it would be, maybe not anybody here, but another 20 years from now, somebody else would have to revisit it.

1106
01:25:52,573 --> 01:25:53,594
[SPEAKER_15]: We will not have to.

1107
01:25:54,534 --> 01:25:55,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not even then.

1108
01:25:55,695 --> 01:25:55,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1109
01:25:56,824 --> 01:26:03,928
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just glad that that was done in a way that it's going to be done for many years and not have to just keep revisiting for that.

1110
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:09,711
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure that was a greater expense, and I'm not sure where those funds came from, but I'm glad you found them.

1111
01:26:10,051 --> 01:26:11,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they got a good deal on it.

1112
01:26:11,772 --> 01:26:12,192
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

1113
01:26:12,713 --> 01:26:16,975
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know a lot of work went into it over the summer, and it's appreciated.

1114
01:26:16,995 --> 01:26:17,935
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.

1115
01:26:18,276 --> 01:26:18,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you again.

1116
01:26:19,728 --> 01:26:22,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, like I said, it takes a lot of people, not just myself.

1117
01:26:22,991 --> 01:26:26,674
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a lot of cooperation with everybody to take on this.

1118
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:27,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1119
01:26:27,795 --> 01:26:28,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much, John.

1120
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:29,276
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for the report.

1121
01:26:30,317 --> 01:26:31,038
[SPEAKER_19]: I had a question.

1122
01:26:31,098 --> 01:26:43,408
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think maybe a number of months ago, the committee voted to have an inventory of all the expensive equipment as like a spreadsheet or some sort of initiative to understand where things are.

1123
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:44,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I sent you something.

1124
01:26:44,989 --> 01:26:47,371
[SPEAKER_15]: I sent you a sort of a kind of a

1125
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:52,728
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what you want to call it, but kind of like at the start of a playbook.

1126
01:26:52,768 --> 01:26:57,994
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought I was actually waiting for you to take a look at it to see if you wanted.

1127
01:26:58,014 --> 01:26:59,356
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll get back to you on that, personally.

1128
01:26:59,376 --> 01:26:59,696
[SPEAKER_19]: That's fine.

1129
01:26:59,716 --> 01:27:01,138
[SPEAKER_19]: If that's the way you prefer to do it, that's OK.

1130
01:27:01,639 --> 01:27:02,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1131
01:27:03,361 --> 01:27:04,322
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Mr. Russo.

1132
01:27:06,174 --> 01:27:06,554
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready?

1133
01:27:06,714 --> 01:27:07,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1134
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:09,035
[SPEAKER_21]: If I had any idea what I was going to ask.

1135
01:27:10,756 --> 01:27:13,698
[SPEAKER_21]: My question was actually around the playground at the Columbus.

1136
01:27:14,178 --> 01:27:26,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Other than the resurfacing, which I understand is in the CPA pipeline, much of the playground equipment itself is not there anymore because it wasn't safe anymore and it's been removed.

1137
01:27:27,044 --> 01:27:33,227
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we even have actually putting a playground back in the Columbus in the plan?

1138
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:34,928
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe so.

1139
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:43,950
[SPEAKER_15]: When I spoke, I went around to all the playgrounds, obviously, when we were preparing for the plan that we were going to do.

1140
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:52,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I spoke to Travis Arms, he's the representative, and I did tell him that we would be repairing.

1141
01:27:53,638 --> 01:28:02,485
[SPEAKER_15]: However, whether it's operational money, there wouldn't be any sense to put a new surface in there without

1142
01:28:03,761 --> 01:28:08,424
[SPEAKER_15]: upgrading the equipment that's in there, obviously, because this lifespan.

1143
01:28:08,484 --> 01:28:13,907
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's almost like at the Andrews, where we went down and we got the money for the roof.

1144
01:28:13,947 --> 01:28:18,329
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, you're going to put a solar panel on a roof that only has five years left?

1145
01:28:18,349 --> 01:28:21,771
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to keep everything running concurrently together.

1146
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:25,393
[SPEAKER_15]: I talked with them.

1147
01:28:25,453 --> 01:28:26,393
[SPEAKER_15]: We were going through it.

1148
01:28:26,433 --> 01:28:27,654
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, we want this replaced.

1149
01:28:27,694 --> 01:28:28,434
[SPEAKER_15]: We want this replaced.

1150
01:28:28,454 --> 01:28:28,895
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?

1151
01:28:30,815 --> 01:28:37,678
[SPEAKER_15]: It wouldn't be worth our time to spend $90,000, $100,000 and then have broken equipment on it.

1152
01:28:37,698 --> 01:28:39,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he working on an estimate for you?

1153
01:28:39,739 --> 01:28:40,459
[SPEAKER_15]: He was, yes.

1154
01:28:40,879 --> 01:28:43,400
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm just concerned about all the equipment that's actually been removed.

1155
01:28:43,927 --> 01:28:44,567
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely.

1156
01:28:44,627 --> 01:28:46,148
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not there, it's not broken.

1157
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:48,549
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like it's just cut off in the MIA.

1158
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:57,873
[SPEAKER_15]: We can come up with a plan, whether we add something new, whether we replace what was there, however people would want to attempt it.

1159
01:28:58,073 --> 01:29:03,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Because new families showing up to the Columbus would be unaware of a number of pieces of equipment that used to be there.

1160
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:04,176
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1161
01:29:04,236 --> 01:29:08,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps in the, if I put the building and grounds committee, that could be a topic that you discuss.

1162
01:29:09,258 --> 01:29:11,479
[SPEAKER_15]: And what you've got to understand, too, is something that was like,

1163
01:29:13,435 --> 01:29:15,796
[SPEAKER_15]: available there, like they had those little mushrooms.

1164
01:29:16,676 --> 01:29:20,238
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not necessarily something that you would put in a playground of today.

1165
01:29:20,258 --> 01:29:22,399
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?

1166
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:26,520
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want the 2001 playground reconstituted.

1167
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:29,421
[SPEAKER_15]: So you might replace it with something else that was appropriate.

1168
01:29:29,901 --> 01:29:30,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1169
01:29:32,761 --> 01:29:35,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1170
01:29:38,226 --> 01:29:39,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to follow up again.

1171
01:29:39,447 --> 01:29:40,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all your work, John.

1172
01:29:40,768 --> 01:29:46,532
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I noted in particular with the compressors, that was a big ticket item and I see a lot of them got done.

1173
01:29:46,653 --> 01:29:47,753
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is just great.

1174
01:29:48,194 --> 01:29:55,540
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing which I noticed on this list is how much of this, you know, it's stuff that people can't see.

1175
01:29:56,283 --> 01:29:58,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be done, but it's not visible stuff.

1176
01:29:58,644 --> 01:29:58,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

1177
01:29:59,284 --> 01:30:00,365
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not paint and wax.

1178
01:30:00,425 --> 01:30:07,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just, I'm making a point because it's important to realize that this is thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars, all of which needs to be done.

1179
01:30:07,768 --> 01:30:07,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1180
01:30:08,088 --> 01:30:09,088
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't really even see.

1181
01:30:09,469 --> 01:30:10,649
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the infrastructure.

1182
01:30:10,689 --> 01:30:11,469
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks again.

1183
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:14,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they know when it's not working.

1184
01:30:14,751 --> 01:30:15,671
Yeah.

1185
01:30:15,711 --> 01:30:16,672
Yes.

1186
01:30:17,212 --> 01:30:17,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1187
01:30:17,432 --> 01:30:19,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz, did you have a final comment on this?

1188
01:30:19,653 --> 01:30:20,613
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about the crosswalks.

1189
01:30:20,713 --> 01:30:24,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I did talk to Steve Tenaglia today at the crosswalk, and he said that.

1190
01:30:24,948 --> 01:30:31,690
[SPEAKER_04]: He was going to do the other crosswalks as soon as they could, if not, like maybe tonight or tomorrow night.

1191
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:34,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on how many cars are in the parking lot.

1192
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:43,893
[SPEAKER_15]: We just want to get in between the after school program and the drop off so that obviously people don't drive over a wet, painted crosswalk.

1193
01:30:44,513 --> 01:30:47,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And he also, there's two crosswalks.

1194
01:30:48,148 --> 01:30:52,372
[SPEAKER_04]: not crosswalks, I'm sorry, stop signs that are in their parking lot that are all faded out.

1195
01:30:52,412 --> 01:30:54,594
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he has two and he can swap them out.

1196
01:30:54,634 --> 01:30:55,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

1197
01:30:55,935 --> 01:30:56,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1198
01:30:57,356 --> 01:31:01,480
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion, is there a motion to receive and place this report on file?

1199
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero, is there a second?

1200
01:31:03,101 --> 01:31:04,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto, all those in favor?

1201
01:31:05,123 --> 01:31:05,903
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1202
01:31:06,164 --> 01:31:06,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1203
01:31:07,465 --> 01:31:08,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Report on attendance, Ms.

1204
01:31:08,966 --> 01:31:09,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Caldwell.

1205
01:31:14,165 --> 01:31:18,628
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've attached for you the current attendance numbers, effective September 5th.

1206
01:31:19,368 --> 01:31:24,010
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still early in the school year, and the Parent Information Center continues to register students.

1207
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:41,380
[SPEAKER_07]: We have 115 pre-kindergarten students, which is up 29 from last year, 288 new kindergartners, and 14 not medically cleared yet, and this was like as of last week, so I'm sure we have more, and approximately 80 new EL students.

1208
01:31:42,087 --> 01:31:47,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Our class size remains excellent and our middle schools are balanced in the sixth grade.

1209
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:58,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first page shows you the overall district counts from Meep at the high school all the way through all the elementary schools.

1210
01:31:59,939 --> 01:32:04,882
[SPEAKER_07]: The second page is the Andrews, McGlynn, Medford High vocational and the Curtis Tufts.

1211
01:32:07,175 --> 01:32:17,238
[SPEAKER_07]: The third page is the elementary school page with the total number of students in each class and the average class size with the number of teachers.

1212
01:32:18,359 --> 01:32:27,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And the very last page is a comparison page from September 5th of last year.

1213
01:32:30,863 --> 01:32:31,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

1214
01:32:31,343 --> 01:32:31,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Caldwell.

1215
01:32:37,298 --> 01:32:37,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

1216
01:32:37,438 --> 01:32:54,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Conwell, do we have any students who are here for medical treatment who might be adversely affected by the federal government's move not to continue their immigration status?

1217
01:32:56,087 --> 01:32:57,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to my knowledge.

1218
01:32:57,528 --> 01:32:57,808
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1219
01:32:58,188 --> 01:33:01,269
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are, would you let us know only so we can advocate for them?

1220
01:33:01,529 --> 01:33:02,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1221
01:33:02,089 --> 01:33:05,731
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't ask immigration on applications for new students.

1222
01:33:05,991 --> 01:33:06,791
[SPEAKER_02]: But you never let me know.

1223
01:33:06,811 --> 01:33:09,913
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they had come to you, it was just a great concern.

1224
01:33:10,633 --> 01:33:10,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1225
01:33:10,953 --> 01:33:11,733
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

1226
01:33:11,873 --> 01:33:12,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

1227
01:33:12,294 --> 01:33:12,674
[SPEAKER_11]: VanCleef.

1228
01:33:13,514 --> 01:33:14,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

1229
01:33:15,515 --> 01:33:24,338
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it possible, I realize that on a day-to-day basis it is not possible, but is it possible once we do our DESE submission on October 1st that

1230
01:33:26,435 --> 01:33:31,632
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we get breakdowns of charter school enrollment by grade to add to this?

1231
01:33:33,087 --> 01:33:33,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

1232
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:34,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I can check on that for you.

1233
01:33:34,548 --> 01:33:35,288
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be helpful.

1234
01:33:35,308 --> 01:33:35,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1235
01:33:35,969 --> 01:33:48,377
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, when I look at a number of different sites that try to talk about the student population, I know ClearGov includes literally every child of educated age broken out by where they're going.

1236
01:33:49,618 --> 01:33:57,223
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know that I have a chart that shows our population of students has remained virtually flat since 1995.

1237
01:33:58,964 --> 01:34:01,646
[SPEAKER_21]: But that doesn't mean the number of students in our public schools has.

1238
01:34:02,486 --> 01:34:24,424
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that'd be helpful, because when I look at the grade 10 from last year, that was 302, and now they're in 11th grade, most of them, and there's a 15 student drop, which on the surface isn't a big number, but if you look at the other grades, we're going up or down five students.

1239
01:34:24,584 --> 01:34:28,548
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm just curious, are we losing, are all these ninth graders

1240
01:34:29,963 --> 01:34:34,131
[SPEAKER_21]: that are 10 or 15 of them, are they bailing for charter schools?

1241
01:34:34,612 --> 01:34:37,057
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, 10 or 15 students is a boatload of money.

1242
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,682
[SPEAKER_21]: Some went up, though.

1243
01:34:40,544 --> 01:34:41,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, they went up by five.

1244
01:34:42,812 --> 01:35:01,038
[SPEAKER_21]: Which I mean, it's hard to know like, you know people just moving in or what I knew or right Yeah, but that would be helpful sure you may not have access but if you do it I can look into that for you sure miss Patterson has been doing quite a bit of work on our charter school population.

1245
01:35:01,158 --> 01:35:11,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, just a Follow-up the charter enrollment is not provided until June of a subsequent year from desi so we are in the process of

1246
01:35:11,964 --> 01:35:23,470
[SPEAKER_05]: going through, we've already identified students that might not have been Medford residents, so we are trying to win back some of our students that were listed under a charter breakdown.

1247
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:38,758
[SPEAKER_05]: So where that's, they've applied to different charter schools, have their application in process, does not necessarily mean that they've actually landed there and or that they could be being incorrectly charged to Medford.

1248
01:35:39,078 --> 01:35:40,519
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are in the process of

1249
01:35:41,182 --> 01:35:46,684
[SPEAKER_05]: going through to our charters to advocate on behalf of our students to return them.

1250
01:35:46,804 --> 01:35:54,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So in terms of an actual annualized up-to-date listing, DESE does not provide that.

1251
01:35:54,527 --> 01:35:57,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't happen until the fourth quarter.

1252
01:35:57,848 --> 01:35:59,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it give it by grade, though?

1253
01:36:00,249 --> 01:36:02,290
[SPEAKER_05]: They have it by year of graduation, I believe.

1254
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:03,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Year of graduation.

1255
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:04,171
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1256
01:36:04,211 --> 01:36:07,452
[SPEAKER_21]: So we could work it out, but we would just be picking an old June date.

1257
01:36:07,492 --> 01:36:07,852
[SPEAKER_21]: Correct.

1258
01:36:08,372 --> 01:36:10,233
[SPEAKER_21]: At least wouldn't it let us know what we're talking about?

1259
01:36:10,733 --> 01:36:15,837
[SPEAKER_21]: Is everybody in kindergarten going to charter schools, or is it where in this?

1260
01:36:16,277 --> 01:36:16,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1261
01:36:17,218 --> 01:36:20,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, our kindergarten numbers this year have increased.

1262
01:36:21,841 --> 01:36:25,624
[SPEAKER_07]: We have 14 to 18 medically unclear children.

1263
01:36:25,664 --> 01:36:30,547
[SPEAKER_07]: So once those kiddos get in, you'll see a little bit of a bump up in kindergarten this year.

1264
01:36:31,448 --> 01:36:31,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1265
01:36:32,168 --> 01:36:32,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1266
01:36:33,569 --> 01:36:33,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1267
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:34,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz?

1268
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:35,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1269
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:36,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a question.

1270
01:36:36,772 --> 01:36:38,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've heard that.

1271
01:36:39,134 --> 01:36:42,575
[SPEAKER_04]: there is an increased class size in the vocational numbers.

1272
01:36:42,975 --> 01:36:50,337
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hard to tell because we're only seeing the total number here, the 322, which is the combined number.

1273
01:36:51,577 --> 01:37:00,900
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering, I mean, if we could just get a breakdown of, you know, the number of students enrolled in the program, maybe at, you know, just an updated report.

1274
01:37:01,509 --> 01:37:03,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have something?

1275
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:03,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1276
01:37:03,611 --> 01:37:04,051
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.

1277
01:37:05,112 --> 01:37:06,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Diane, I have one.

1278
01:37:06,313 --> 01:37:09,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on Mia, I'm sorry.

1279
01:37:09,875 --> 01:37:11,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information miss must own.

1280
01:37:11,876 --> 01:37:16,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I just spoke with Mr. Delay because someone else had asked about a breakdown.

1281
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:22,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the sophomore class currently at the high school is 150 enrolled in CTE and 170 in the high school.

1282
01:37:24,926 --> 01:37:27,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the only class that someone had asked me about.

1283
01:37:31,290 --> 01:37:39,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, I do have that 207 in ninth grade in CTE and 122 in high school.

1284
01:37:40,337 --> 01:37:41,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, 207 in CTE.

1285
01:37:41,938 --> 01:37:42,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1286
01:37:42,179 --> 01:37:42,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1287
01:37:42,459 --> 01:37:47,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Mastone, I love standing here and have other people answer the questions.

1288
01:37:47,863 --> 01:37:49,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was just curious because I heard about the increase.

1289
01:37:49,785 --> 01:37:50,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that point of information.

1290
01:37:52,146 --> 01:37:52,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

1291
01:37:52,607 --> 01:37:52,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz.

1292
01:37:53,588 --> 01:37:53,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1293
01:37:54,028 --> 01:37:54,508
[SPEAKER_11]: You're all set?

1294
01:37:54,829 --> 01:37:54,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1295
01:37:57,465 --> 01:37:58,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1296
01:37:58,525 --> 01:37:58,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1297
01:37:59,325 --> 01:38:06,647
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're requesting the data on charter schools, we should also include private and parochial schools.

1298
01:38:07,087 --> 01:38:11,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if the drop off is between ninth and 10th grade, it could be an MCAS issue.

1299
01:38:12,089 --> 01:38:21,171
[SPEAKER_13]: And we want to make sure that it's still our children if we're educating them.

1300
01:38:21,211 --> 01:38:23,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Whether or not it's our dollars, it's still our.

1301
01:38:24,152 --> 01:38:25,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Mr. Russo.

1302
01:38:26,655 --> 01:38:28,456
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just not sure what an MCAS issue means.

1303
01:38:29,256 --> 01:38:38,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, kids that don't want to take MCAS when they go to parochial private schools, they're not held to that standard.

1304
01:38:38,539 --> 01:38:43,560
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to know if students are leaving Method High for that reason as well.

1305
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:51,523
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just as important that we make sure we're educating them and feeling confident so that they don't feel like they have to leave for those reasons as well.

1306
01:38:51,943 --> 01:38:55,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a reporting that's done to the school system of Catholic and

1307
01:38:55,737 --> 01:38:59,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're talking about Matanon and Arlington Catholic, like high schools?

1308
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,803
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, like MC, Malden Catholics, things like that.

1309
01:39:05,223 --> 01:39:05,684
[SPEAKER_13]: All of them?

1310
01:39:05,824 --> 01:39:07,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Any of them.

1311
01:39:07,145 --> 01:39:19,273
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have reasons while people withdraw, if you get the reasoning, if they're going to, like you, when people withdraw, you have to report to the Department of Education the reason whether they're forwarding to a

1312
01:39:20,052 --> 01:39:28,339
[SPEAKER_13]: another public school district, if they're going to a charter school, if they're going to private, or any way of that.

1313
01:39:28,499 --> 01:39:36,766
[SPEAKER_13]: And just for our own information, because if ninth graders are feeling like they're not comfortable passing that, and parents are moving them, we want to know that.

1314
01:39:36,786 --> 01:39:42,431
[SPEAKER_07]: We do get that information, actually, because schools will ask us for records, so we know where they're going.

1315
01:39:42,711 --> 01:39:42,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1316
01:39:43,512 --> 01:39:48,336
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to add that each year, we need to file a school's attending report with the Department of Ed.

1317
01:39:48,963 --> 01:39:51,484
[SPEAKER_06]: So that comes out of my office.

1318
01:39:51,524 --> 01:39:53,264
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is submitted every February.

1319
01:39:53,304 --> 01:39:54,664
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do have the numbers from 2019.

1320
01:39:55,845 --> 01:39:58,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can take a look at that.

1321
01:39:58,705 --> 01:40:04,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also can get some other numbers from School Brains and what we have in district.

1322
01:40:05,007 --> 01:40:09,448
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is something that we're required to report, all of the private school placements.

1323
01:40:09,468 --> 01:40:09,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1324
01:40:11,188 --> 01:40:11,448
[SPEAKER_06]: All set?

1325
01:40:12,808 --> 01:40:17,193
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Ms.

1326
01:40:17,234 --> 01:40:17,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz?

1327
01:40:17,554 --> 01:40:18,755
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1328
01:40:19,196 --> 01:40:19,977
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1329
01:40:20,077 --> 01:40:20,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1330
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:23,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Report on personnel, Ms.

1331
01:40:23,461 --> 01:40:23,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Patterson.

1332
01:40:29,472 --> 01:40:29,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1333
01:40:30,273 --> 01:40:36,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are happy to report that we have rolled out our new recruiting and hiring platform.

1334
01:40:37,078 --> 01:40:40,040
[SPEAKER_05]: This completely automates our process.

1335
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:52,589
[SPEAKER_05]: So where we are able to post on different job boards, we direct them to our Medford website and they apply to our jobs completely electronically.

1336
01:40:52,669 --> 01:40:55,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have all the demographic information in.

1337
01:40:55,551 --> 01:40:56,892
[SPEAKER_05]: We are able to compile

1338
01:40:57,415 --> 01:41:09,023
[SPEAKER_05]: job position pools for various positions that we know are ongoing, such as lifeguards, daily subs, paraprofessionals are a very active group as well.

1339
01:41:09,864 --> 01:41:26,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, we started this at the end of May of 2019, so this was a very busy summer season with rolling out the new system and providing all of the job postings and getting the new hires in through the automated process.

1340
01:41:27,143 --> 01:41:29,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have an accurate count just as of yet.

1341
01:41:29,765 --> 01:41:37,070
[SPEAKER_05]: We are still having active resignations, changes, things of that sort as late as today.

1342
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:42,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't want to provide information that was inaccurate or not up to date.

1343
01:41:42,734 --> 01:41:50,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I will have that available once things have settled out and we have a full, fully staffed department.

1344
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:52,740
[SPEAKER_05]: buildings, building-based.

1345
01:41:53,401 --> 01:41:54,581
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are excited.

1346
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:59,844
[SPEAKER_05]: The platform provides both external and internal postings.

1347
01:42:00,304 --> 01:42:08,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So once we are truly 100% committed, we'll be able to post all of the stipend coaching positions.

1348
01:42:08,348 --> 01:42:12,311
[SPEAKER_05]: We've outfitted all of those for this school year, 19-20.

1349
01:42:13,091 --> 01:42:16,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And going forward, we will have those positions posted.

1350
01:42:18,815 --> 01:42:25,340
[SPEAKER_05]: The winter, fall sports that have not had coaches, we will be posting those positions as well.

1351
01:42:26,041 --> 01:42:32,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way everything is, again, we are onboarding our staff from the system.

1352
01:42:33,267 --> 01:42:34,208
[SPEAKER_05]: It streamlines it.

1353
01:42:34,428 --> 01:42:39,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It reduces human error in terms of reading employee application information.

1354
01:42:40,505 --> 01:42:45,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It has reduced the application process and streamlined it completely automated.

1355
01:42:45,147 --> 01:42:55,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So where we used to provide a very large packet of hand copy paper, it's now fully electronic and streamlined.

1356
01:42:56,092 --> 01:43:03,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are very excited as well as being able to provide the demographics of our pool of candidates.

1357
01:43:03,735 --> 01:43:08,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did provide a sample of the equal employment opportunity report.

1358
01:43:09,057 --> 01:43:10,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So that just shows you

1359
01:43:10,837 --> 01:43:16,439
[SPEAKER_05]: the volume of where we have had just in a short amount of time.

1360
01:43:16,919 --> 01:43:22,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also provides the demographics based on what people have self-reported.

1361
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,761
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't ask that up front.

1362
01:43:25,041 --> 01:43:27,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It's voluntary in nature.

1363
01:43:27,542 --> 01:43:33,623
[SPEAKER_05]: But it gives us a better idea of our application pool and the applicants that are coming forward.

1364
01:43:33,683 --> 01:43:35,564
[SPEAKER_05]: We are very committed to

1365
01:43:37,036 --> 01:43:40,599
[SPEAKER_05]: diversity and hiring diverse staff.

1366
01:43:40,899 --> 01:43:51,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is a tool that will be able to have better reporting capabilities and really streamline this process and make it much more efficient for all of Medford public schools.

1367
01:43:52,289 --> 01:43:52,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1368
01:43:53,570 --> 01:43:54,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

1369
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:55,451
[SPEAKER_21]: This is amazing.

1370
01:43:55,471 --> 01:43:55,791
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1371
01:43:56,922 --> 01:44:08,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, this system, I believe it was in the spring I had a communication with you about reports that I get on the Shore Educational Collaborative, where I'm the Medford representative.

1372
01:44:10,682 --> 01:44:22,005
[SPEAKER_21]: We get a report each time we meet that has a list of people who are out on leave, why they're out on leave, as much as we're allowed to know, terminations, retirements, et cetera.

1373
01:44:22,946 --> 01:44:28,247
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just assumed that was a report that we got there because they decided to do it.

1374
01:44:29,467 --> 01:44:34,829
[SPEAKER_21]: And then when I asked the representatives from the other six or seven or eight school committees that were there,

1375
01:44:35,733 --> 01:44:38,816
[SPEAKER_21]: literally everyone said, no, we all get this report.

1376
01:44:38,916 --> 01:44:40,317
[SPEAKER_21]: You're supposed to get this report.

1377
01:44:40,697 --> 01:44:44,701
[SPEAKER_21]: So will that system, this new system, actually be able to generate that report?

1378
01:44:44,721 --> 01:44:49,745
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I know when we talked, doing it by hand was not going to be it.

1379
01:44:50,406 --> 01:44:50,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1380
01:44:50,726 --> 01:44:57,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So this system would not be able to identify terminations, resignations, and or leave of absence.

1381
01:44:57,812 --> 01:45:02,917
[SPEAKER_05]: That is still a separate manual reporting component because

1382
01:45:03,835 --> 01:45:07,479
[SPEAKER_05]: In the system, we're posting for new hires.

1383
01:45:08,059 --> 01:45:20,611
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though in a notation, we can make a note internally that this posting is due to a resignation, x, y, z, or due to a long-term coverage situation.

1384
01:45:21,001 --> 01:45:24,804
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's not a reportable field in this particular system.

1385
01:45:25,304 --> 01:45:35,151
[SPEAKER_05]: So in terms of that listing, yes, we will be able to provide that for the upcoming year, but it is a manual report, not system generated.

1386
01:45:35,171 --> 01:45:36,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1387
01:45:37,553 --> 01:45:38,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1388
01:45:38,954 --> 01:45:42,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion to receive and place this report on file?

1389
01:45:42,556 --> 01:45:44,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero, Ms.

1390
01:45:44,357 --> 01:45:45,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz, seconded by Ms.

1391
01:45:45,318 --> 01:45:45,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz.

1392
01:45:45,598 --> 01:45:46,279
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1393
01:45:46,299 --> 01:45:46,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1394
01:45:47,079 --> 01:45:47,840
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1395
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1396
01:45:50,582 --> 01:45:53,823
[SPEAKER_11]: And report on summer programs, Dr. Peter Cushing.

1397
01:45:53,903 --> 01:45:55,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, Dr. Cushing.

1398
01:45:55,943 --> 01:45:56,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1399
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:59,144
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the opportunity to speak with everybody tonight.

1400
01:45:59,504 --> 01:46:03,325
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I just want to talk about the various summer programs we had.

1401
01:46:04,025 --> 01:46:09,426
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford Summer Fund Program, the report was submitted by Anthony Petropoulos, the program director.

1402
01:46:10,266 --> 01:46:14,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Entered its 13th year for about eight weeks over the summer.

1403
01:46:15,147 --> 01:46:18,548
[SPEAKER_14]: saw between 100 and 120 campers participate.

1404
01:46:19,668 --> 01:46:22,369
[SPEAKER_14]: During the summer, we obviously had a lot of heat issues.

1405
01:46:22,529 --> 01:46:23,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Myself, Ms.

1406
01:46:23,989 --> 01:46:32,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Caldwell, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, we all took opportunities to not only go up to the fields for summer fun, but to visit the schools to check on various rooms.

1407
01:46:33,091 --> 01:46:38,032
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a number of people bring in their own air conditioners for a few of those hot days when they were working on the air conditioning.

1408
01:46:38,632 --> 01:46:43,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Really a team effort to really make sure that our kids were safe throughout.

1409
01:46:43,833 --> 01:46:47,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Back to summer fun, there were 28 full and part-time employees.

1410
01:46:47,935 --> 01:46:50,736
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of great activities I saw the kids involved with.

1411
01:46:51,137 --> 01:46:52,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Two special guests.

1412
01:46:52,797 --> 01:46:55,178
[SPEAKER_14]: First was District Attorney Marion Ryan.

1413
01:46:55,219 --> 01:46:58,120
[SPEAKER_14]: She brought her Jeopardy game on making sure the kids were safe.

1414
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:06,224
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mayor Burke brought our kids a lot of ice cream slash freeze pops, I should say, freeze pops.

1415
01:47:08,045 --> 01:47:17,892
[SPEAKER_14]: The camp made effective use of the Facebook page to publicize the Tufts University research group's case study on healthy and unhealthy eating habits.

1416
01:47:19,173 --> 01:47:23,176
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was something that was really good that was done with parent permission, parent-guardian permission.

1417
01:47:24,476 --> 01:47:28,398
[SPEAKER_14]: David Blouk supported the report to me on the summer school participation.

1418
01:47:29,518 --> 01:47:32,919
[SPEAKER_14]: 114 students through grades 6 through 12 participated.

1419
01:47:33,799 --> 01:47:38,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Courses ran from 8 in the morning till noon with two sections of two-hour blocks.

1420
01:47:39,301 --> 01:47:47,624
[SPEAKER_14]: The online system software Play-Doh was utilized by a number of students to help them make their effective academic progress.

1421
01:47:49,424 --> 01:47:51,485
[SPEAKER_14]: 14, I'm sorry, there was a typo.

1422
01:47:52,386 --> 01:47:54,567
[SPEAKER_14]: If you notice down the bottom, graduation is 12.

1423
01:47:55,167 --> 01:48:00,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Students reach graduation status by completing summer courses, going on to the third page there.

1424
01:48:01,230 --> 01:48:05,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Eight students received their diplomas and four their certificate attainment.

1425
01:48:06,192 --> 01:48:18,780
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a great celebration on August 21st that many of you were able to attend to really celebrate those students, celebrate them not only with their diplomas but also with cake.

1426
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:23,522
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't bring any of the leftover hamburgers from the event earlier in the day.

1427
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:28,965
[SPEAKER_14]: The sixth grade barbecue, sixth grade barbecue was another phenomenal event.

1428
01:48:29,526 --> 01:48:33,368
[SPEAKER_14]: For those of you that were there, I've done a comprehensive research analysis

1429
01:48:33,912 --> 01:48:41,755
[SPEAKER_14]: and have determined that the hockey pucks that were developed were either operator error or a flaw in the equipment that we used.

1430
01:48:42,335 --> 01:48:48,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Somewhere in between, I'm leaning toward flaw in the equipment as I was the operator.

1431
01:48:50,138 --> 01:48:51,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, absolutely.

1432
01:48:52,059 --> 01:49:02,343
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have the breakdown prepared by our assistant principal, David Blug, the program director for summer school on those students and the courses that they took.

1433
01:49:04,972 --> 01:49:10,376
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the extended year program prepared by Lisa Iannelli.

1434
01:49:10,396 --> 01:49:13,058
[SPEAKER_14]: 136 students were slated to receive services this summer.

1435
01:49:13,078 --> 01:49:17,582
[SPEAKER_14]: 19 students, for whatever reason, chose not to attend.

1436
01:49:18,322 --> 01:49:29,511
[SPEAKER_14]: But the programs that we saw were very well maintained and provided opportunities to really maintain their academic achievement without losing that over the summer.

1437
01:49:30,792 --> 01:49:31,472
[SPEAKER_14]: So, thank you.

1438
01:49:33,193 --> 01:49:33,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1439
01:49:34,354 --> 01:49:34,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1440
01:49:35,254 --> 01:49:38,156
[SPEAKER_13]: I had some questions and I'm not sure you'll have the answers to them.

1441
01:49:39,056 --> 01:49:40,757
[SPEAKER_13]: It was about the summer fun camp.

1442
01:49:41,538 --> 01:49:55,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Last year we worked hand in hand at the special education subcommittee to make sure that the staff was trained to and had paperwork ready for all students with any needs.

1443
01:49:56,700 --> 01:50:17,274
[SPEAKER_13]: So that they would be met and I was also curious about having did the price increase in the summer fun camp affect enrollment in any way and if we provided it more families with Vouchers or scholarships to help them through that So maybe you could just get back to us on that.

1444
01:50:17,334 --> 01:50:22,278
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that you might not have those answers I'd be happy to get those because I definitely don't have those answers.

1445
01:50:22,338 --> 01:50:22,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1446
01:50:22,998 --> 01:50:23,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

1447
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:23,839
[SPEAKER_13]: I

1448
01:50:25,277 --> 01:50:27,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

1449
01:50:27,798 --> 01:50:29,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

1450
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:29,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz.

1451
01:50:29,559 --> 01:50:30,260
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1452
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:31,441
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1453
01:50:31,481 --> 01:50:32,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1454
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:35,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Report on middle school lottery implementation.

1455
01:50:35,723 --> 01:50:37,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edouard Vincent.

1456
01:50:39,845 --> 01:50:40,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

1457
01:50:40,526 --> 01:50:41,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll put you on.

1458
01:50:43,207 --> 01:50:43,567
[SPEAKER_16]: You are.

1459
01:50:44,488 --> 01:50:44,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1460
01:50:44,668 --> 01:50:47,810
[SPEAKER_16]: Lazzaro.

1461
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:51,392
[SPEAKER_16]: So what we're going to present to you shortly

1462
01:50:52,487 --> 01:50:57,891
[SPEAKER_16]: is the results of the outcome of the middle school lottery.

1463
01:50:59,373 --> 01:51:17,927
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to show you the data from the fall, or not from the fall, the data from the late spring when we initially presented the information, and then where we ended up at the end of the school year, taking into account students that were added.

1464
01:51:17,947 --> 01:51:21,390
[SPEAKER_16]: So these are our most recent numbers that are gonna be shared with you.

1465
01:51:23,083 --> 01:51:27,407
[SPEAKER_16]: So this presentation is titled, once again, Correcting the Imbalance.

1466
01:51:28,748 --> 01:51:33,152
[SPEAKER_16]: This was the state of the two middle schools prior to the middle school lottery.

1467
01:51:34,573 --> 01:51:39,337
[SPEAKER_16]: So here is the McGlynn Middle School, the racial breakdown.

1468
01:51:39,677 --> 01:51:46,603
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the original data prior to the lottery, followed by the Andrews Middle School.

1469
01:51:51,314 --> 01:51:56,356
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is the McGlynn socioeconomic status breakdown.

1470
01:51:58,537 --> 01:52:02,259
[SPEAKER_16]: And blue represents families that are paying.

1471
01:52:03,499 --> 01:52:09,202
[SPEAKER_16]: And the following slide is the Andrews.

1472
01:52:13,244 --> 01:52:16,525
[SPEAKER_16]: And so what did we do to solve this disparity?

1473
01:52:16,545 --> 01:52:18,446
[SPEAKER_16]: We conducted

1474
01:52:21,043 --> 01:52:21,643
[SPEAKER_16]: the lottery.

1475
01:52:24,346 --> 01:52:33,753
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you can see here, students and families would no longer choose which middle school to attend, but would be randomly assigned to a middle school.

1476
01:52:35,314 --> 01:52:48,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Students who were English learners and or students with specific special education needs, they would be automatically assigned to the corresponding middle school that offered their program.

1477
01:52:49,965 --> 01:52:50,346
[SPEAKER_16]: And so

1478
01:52:50,928 --> 01:52:55,851
[SPEAKER_16]: the purpose of the lottery, a lot of people wanted to find out, did it work?

1479
01:52:58,954 --> 01:53:00,314
[SPEAKER_16]: The answer is yes.

1480
01:53:03,016 --> 01:53:10,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Although it's not a perfect system, it helped to create greater balance between the schools.

1481
01:53:11,422 --> 01:53:14,404
[SPEAKER_16]: So once again, I show you the original data.

1482
01:53:14,464 --> 01:53:19,728
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the racial breakdown of the McGlynn, followed by the Andrews,

1483
01:53:22,114 --> 01:53:36,023
[SPEAKER_16]: And for school year 2019-20, this is the new breakdown of the McGlynn School and the new breakdown of the Andrews Middle School.

1484
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:48,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Cushing, I was going to ask you to go back one more time just for a quick second.

1485
01:53:51,513 --> 01:53:54,374
[SPEAKER_16]: And Andrews, okay, you can move forward, thank you.

1486
01:53:56,694 --> 01:54:16,100
[SPEAKER_16]: So what you can see is that the incoming sixth grade classes, they're not 100% equal, but they are much closer to equity, to an equitable balance between the two schools.

1487
01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:36,561
[SPEAKER_16]: And so by having the lottery, it's going to allow us to have a student body that will more closely reflect balanced demographics between both schools in the coming years.

1488
01:54:44,828 --> 01:54:50,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, looking at the SES, our socioeconomic status, the next slide, please.

1489
01:54:53,183 --> 01:55:00,069
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the original McGlynn's socioeconomic status.

1490
01:55:01,731 --> 01:55:03,692
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is the original Andrews School.

1491
01:55:05,234 --> 01:55:12,380
[SPEAKER_16]: The next slide will show you the 2019 data for the McGlynn Middle School as it stands right now.

1492
01:55:14,962 --> 01:55:17,725
[SPEAKER_16]: And the following slide is the Andrews.

1493
01:55:28,484 --> 01:55:29,945
[SPEAKER_16]: just give you a moment to reflect.

1494
01:55:37,489 --> 01:55:50,516
[SPEAKER_16]: So as you can see, um, it is definitely a much more even distribution at the sixth grade between both schools as opposed to the previous years.

1495
01:55:52,357 --> 01:55:56,840
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to say that, um,

1496
01:55:58,241 --> 01:56:17,446
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank you all, Mayor Burke, and you, the esteemed members of the school committee, because I know that this was a courageous decision initially to look at data and think about how could we bring about greater balance, correcting the imbalance that took place.

1497
01:56:18,146 --> 01:56:24,308
[SPEAKER_16]: And so a lot of people, including parents in the community, were wondering how this was going to play out

1498
01:56:24,799 --> 01:56:26,640
[SPEAKER_16]: And would it actually make a difference?

1499
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:44,068
[SPEAKER_16]: And by doing the random lottery, it did make, at least at the sixth grade level, it was random, but it made a noticeable significant difference in terms of bringing about greater balance between the two sixth grade classrooms.

1500
01:56:44,728 --> 01:56:48,810
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I just want to thank you all for your support.

1501
01:56:49,483 --> 01:56:52,164
[SPEAKER_16]: and to see that this is the outcome of what happened.

1502
01:56:52,224 --> 01:57:11,613
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I truly am grateful to you all and to the community the parents the students who kind of went on this journey with us trusted us and to be able to show the data that the data did move and that we made a difference for this sixth grade incoming class.

1503
01:57:12,273 --> 01:57:18,036
[SPEAKER_16]: And we truly are committed to continuing to create opportunities for both schools

1504
01:57:18,633 --> 01:57:24,376
[SPEAKER_16]: to work collaboratively together, because I truly believe that we are one Medford, one district.

1505
01:57:25,037 --> 01:57:27,598
[SPEAKER_16]: And so this was our report.

1506
01:57:28,378 --> 01:57:35,482
[SPEAKER_16]: And once again, our final slide, I will say, go Mustangs, because we are one Mustang community.

1507
01:57:35,762 --> 01:57:36,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1508
01:57:36,943 --> 01:57:38,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Maurice.

1509
01:57:40,305 --> 01:57:40,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1510
01:57:40,865 --> 01:57:41,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1511
01:57:41,145 --> 01:57:41,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Kritz.

1512
01:57:45,419 --> 01:57:46,380
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a nice story.

1513
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:51,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we all got an email message from a former MedBit resident.

1514
01:57:52,083 --> 01:57:56,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I ended up calling her because I wanted to, you know, try to just talk to her.

1515
01:57:57,366 --> 01:57:59,567
[SPEAKER_04]: So she had some questions about the original

1516
01:58:02,849 --> 01:58:07,814
[SPEAKER_04]: numbers that were at both middle schools and she was concerned, you know, what are we doing about it?

1517
01:58:07,834 --> 01:58:14,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, wow, the timing of this email is just bizarre because we just got an update in our packet this weekend.

1518
01:58:14,841 --> 01:58:19,286
[SPEAKER_04]: So I shared the results with her and she was just completely impressed and

1519
01:58:19,706 --> 01:58:23,230
[SPEAKER_04]: She asked for me to mail a copy to her where she lives in New York.

1520
01:58:23,610 --> 01:58:25,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to do that and mail her a copy.

1521
01:58:25,772 --> 01:58:27,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just really noticeable.

1522
01:58:27,875 --> 01:58:28,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really dramatic.

1523
01:58:28,956 --> 01:58:31,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't think it would really move that quickly.

1524
01:58:31,418 --> 01:58:32,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I really didn't think.

1525
01:58:32,259 --> 01:58:33,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just incredible.

1526
01:58:34,482 --> 01:58:36,504
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just had one other question.

1527
01:58:37,525 --> 01:58:41,469
[SPEAKER_04]: A parent had asked me, so her student was in the

1528
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:59,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Her student was or wasn't in the lottery, I'm not really sure, but her student is in the language-based program, but I guess that group of students wasn't put into the lottery, and she was just wondering why they weren't put into the lottery, where there is a language-based program at both schools.

1529
01:59:00,658 --> 01:59:02,419
[SPEAKER_04]: If you would maybe know the answer to that.

1530
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:16,824
[SPEAKER_16]: The students that are assigned the students with special needs and or else based on what is spelled out within the respective individualized education plans.

1531
01:59:18,404 --> 01:59:26,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Students are assigned based on that information, so although you could have.

1532
01:59:28,237 --> 01:59:35,839
[SPEAKER_16]: the same title of the programming, it's not the same exact, it's not identical.

1533
01:59:36,259 --> 01:59:43,862
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it is something that the special education team definitely looks carefully at and looks at what

1534
01:59:46,218 --> 01:59:47,959
[SPEAKER_16]: offering each school has.

1535
01:59:49,480 --> 02:00:01,546
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're not able to have identical programming of everything in each building, because it would be a lot of significant human capital implications for doing that.

1536
02:00:02,226 --> 02:00:13,932
[SPEAKER_16]: But with the way the programs are divvied up right now, we are able to have teachers that are highly qualified meeting the needs of those respective students.

1537
02:00:15,483 --> 02:00:16,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

1538
02:00:16,644 --> 02:00:17,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1539
02:00:19,406 --> 02:00:21,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record from the public.

1540
02:00:22,108 --> 02:00:24,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we get that light shut off, please?

1541
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:25,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1542
02:00:25,911 --> 02:00:28,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1543
02:00:31,487 --> 02:00:32,108
[SPEAKER_12]: 281 Park Street.

1544
02:00:32,748 --> 02:00:35,189
[SPEAKER_12]: My family experienced the lottery this year.

1545
02:00:36,289 --> 02:00:39,670
[SPEAKER_12]: We're parents that were from the Roberts Elementary School.

1546
02:00:40,571 --> 02:00:47,153
[SPEAKER_12]: We found that the lottery was not evenly split for the Roberts Elementary School because we do have the Yale Welcome Program.

1547
02:00:47,933 --> 02:00:54,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Although they are members of our community, they are not members who actually had integrated with our students during their time at the Roberts.

1548
02:00:55,176 --> 02:00:57,277
[SPEAKER_12]: So when they split our students in half,

1549
02:00:58,258 --> 02:01:08,302
[SPEAKER_12]: What happened was 53 students went to the Andrews, and some were in the neighborhood of the low 20s of the students that they had been in class with daily for six years went to the McGlynn.

1550
02:01:08,822 --> 02:01:16,005
[SPEAKER_12]: The students that went to the McGlynn found themselves to be fairly socially isolated because the majority of their friends did go to the Andrews.

1551
02:01:16,806 --> 02:01:24,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyone who was present for the lottery when they pulled the Roberts' names saw several circles of friends, boys, girls,

1552
02:01:25,009 --> 02:01:35,414
[SPEAKER_12]: all the students in the circle would cheer except for one, the one student who chose the McGlynn and found that they were being separated from all of their children, all of their friends.

1553
02:01:35,514 --> 02:01:50,420
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm hoping that when we think about the lottery this year, that we think about while it's great that some of the equity has changed, and I'm not saying that's bad, perhaps we could have offset each of the elementary schools by five children.

1554
02:01:51,357 --> 02:02:01,164
[SPEAKER_12]: And instead of having the offset at the Roberts be close to 30 children, in that case, my daughter would have had 15 more friends at the McGlynn.

1555
02:02:01,705 --> 02:02:05,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Those students that are also in the low 20s are also split between two sides.

1556
02:02:06,608 --> 02:02:10,551
[SPEAKER_12]: She had about two friends that she socialized with that were going to the McGlynn.

1557
02:02:10,611 --> 02:02:18,977
[SPEAKER_12]: And one week before school started, one of the friends called her excitedly and said, yes, I got transferred to the Andrews.

1558
02:02:19,418 --> 02:02:21,079
[SPEAKER_12]: She quickly went down to one friend.

1559
02:02:21,607 --> 02:02:24,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Her first week was really isolated.

1560
02:02:25,229 --> 02:02:42,957
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not a lot of opportunities to talk to children, and at lunch and recess, as she walked around the track, she said, a lot of the children are with the friends that they've had for years, which I had hoped for my child as I enrolled her in Medford Public Schools at the age of three, so that she would have long-lasting friendships.

1561
02:02:43,787 --> 02:02:48,933
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hope that socio-emotional will factor in this year in the lottery.

1562
02:02:49,013 --> 02:02:51,696
[SPEAKER_12]: I know this was a unique situation for the Roberts.

1563
02:02:52,697 --> 02:02:56,982
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that it's vitally important to look at for next year.

1564
02:02:57,763 --> 02:02:58,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1565
02:02:58,383 --> 02:02:58,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1566
02:02:58,904 --> 02:02:59,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the feedback.

1567
02:03:04,742 --> 02:03:09,086
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Melanie McLaughlin and I live at 152 Austin Street in Medford.

1568
02:03:10,147 --> 02:03:15,392
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank you all for looking at the equity and balance across the middle schools.

1569
02:03:16,173 --> 02:03:20,978
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm also the co-chair of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council and have been for the past six years.

1570
02:03:21,658 --> 02:03:26,160
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the things that we're concerned about is equity across the district for every child.

1571
02:03:26,620 --> 02:03:35,924
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's about, we understand that there's some programmatic elements regarding EL and special education, but I think those visuals were very helpful and supportive.

1572
02:03:35,964 --> 02:03:36,764
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a visual learner.

1573
02:03:36,784 --> 02:03:38,225
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought those were really great.

1574
02:03:38,305 --> 02:03:46,708
[SPEAKER_17]: I would love to see those visuals for special education in English language and what that looks like at the middle schools and to be able to see if there's a disparity there.

1575
02:03:47,408 --> 02:03:50,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Is one middle school getting more of those students and another not?

1576
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:52,512
[SPEAKER_17]: And what that actually looks like for us.

1577
02:03:52,572 --> 02:03:59,576
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I think as I said from the podium last year, as we're thinking about equity, we have to think about it for all of our students.

1578
02:04:00,216 --> 02:04:03,399
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that the socioeconomic piece here is really compelling.

1579
02:04:03,819 --> 02:04:10,143
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, there's a big piece that we feel is missing, which is the special education and English learner.

1580
02:04:10,543 --> 02:04:19,274
[SPEAKER_17]: population piece as well, and I know that there have been a lot of families that have been frustrated and have given me feedback about that, either being automatic.

1581
02:04:19,355 --> 02:04:25,643
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that you're saying, part of the problem is that the IEP does drive the process and the team decisions, but a lot of times the

1582
02:04:26,103 --> 02:04:33,510
[SPEAKER_17]: families don't know what the expectations are, the programming might be or why the McGlynn is different than the Andrews or what the programmatic elements are.

1583
02:04:33,610 --> 02:04:41,256
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think it's also worth doing a comparison when we're saying everybody sort of dismisses what we can't have similar programs at these schools.

1584
02:04:41,356 --> 02:04:46,941
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that I would like to say, let's think out of the box a little bit more around that and say, well, what would that look like?

1585
02:04:46,981 --> 02:04:47,902
[SPEAKER_17]: What does that actually mean?

1586
02:04:47,942 --> 02:04:49,483
[SPEAKER_17]: How does that really break down into numbers?

1587
02:04:49,544 --> 02:04:53,447
[SPEAKER_17]: And since the schools are only a few hundred feet away from each other, is that actually

1588
02:04:53,803 --> 02:05:01,307
[SPEAKER_17]: realistic, can we not have people transporting, you know, between the schools, whether it's, you know, staff on different days or what, I don't know.

1589
02:05:01,327 --> 02:05:13,173
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think thinking outside of the box for our EL students and our special education students as well so that they feel like they're having equity across the district is really important because we're not feeling that right now and I think that we need to be.

1590
02:05:13,713 --> 02:05:16,635
[SPEAKER_17]: So, but I appreciate the courageous conversations that we're having.

1591
02:05:16,675 --> 02:05:18,576
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is really important around equity.

1592
02:05:19,236 --> 02:05:21,678
[SPEAKER_17]: I also really appreciate that it's been done at the middle school level.

1593
02:05:22,538 --> 02:05:32,624
[SPEAKER_17]: I know and I hope that we'll be looking in the future at the elementary school levels as well, because I think that these visuals and these demographics are really important to create the conversation that you're starting here.

1594
02:05:32,684 --> 02:05:34,345
[SPEAKER_17]: So we appreciate that you're doing that.

1595
02:05:35,186 --> 02:05:38,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you think we might have a visual for the special education EL?

1596
02:05:39,548 --> 02:05:46,839
[SPEAKER_16]: So the one piece would be that, for example, the McGlynn houses the EL program.

1597
02:05:47,279 --> 02:05:51,846
[SPEAKER_16]: So because the EL teachers are based at the McGlynn,

1598
02:05:54,495 --> 02:06:04,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, we would not see the same numbers reflected at the Andrews, whereas the Andrews does house one of our specialized special education programs, the TLP program.

1599
02:06:05,079 --> 02:06:07,480
[SPEAKER_16]: That program does not exist at the McGlynn.

1600
02:06:07,940 --> 02:06:12,102
[SPEAKER_16]: So the students, so you could have a higher number of students with disabilities

1601
02:06:12,885 --> 02:06:18,753
[SPEAKER_16]: at one school because they're housing a specific program, but that was what we had.

1602
02:06:19,374 --> 02:06:23,359
[SPEAKER_16]: We know that it's not exactly 50-50.

1603
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:30,029
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't have the numbers just right now, how many students are in this specialized program.

1604
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:33,170
[SPEAKER_16]: but that is something that I could definitely get.

1605
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:34,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1606
02:06:34,471 --> 02:06:56,959
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the visual would be really helpful, and then just also understanding the programmatic elements at the school so that people can understand what this actually breaks down to and not have this ambiguity around, you know, all the EL students are going here, some of the kids with disabilities are there, some are there, and it's not making people want to be at one school or another, you know, because then it creates another level of inequity and conversation.

1607
02:06:58,371 --> 02:06:58,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1608
02:06:58,711 --> 02:06:59,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1609
02:06:59,352 --> 02:06:59,892
