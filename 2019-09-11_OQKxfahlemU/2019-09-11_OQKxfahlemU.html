    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=204.042s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=205.363s">Approval</a>  of the minutes of June 24, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=207.705s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=211.347s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=214.51s">There's</a>  a motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=216.311s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=216.892s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=217.653s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=218.253s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=219.194s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=219.914s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=220.695s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=222.316s">Motion</a>  granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=223.737s">Approval</a>  of bills, transfer of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=225.559s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=229.082s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=233.549s">Mayor</a>  Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=240.633s">I</a>  had a few questions if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=242.494s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=243.374s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=244.235s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=247.957s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=249.438s">On</a>  page first, I have a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=252.559s">My</a>  stickies work. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=254.32s">As</a>  usual, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=255.081s">On</a>  page 7 of 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=258.795s">The</a>  National Grilled Bill for 16-2802, it's unclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=264.319s">I</a>  just didn't know why it would be unclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=268.962s">Maybe</a>  it was just before. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=272.344s">It's</a>  like the fifth one down.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=274.726s">Yes,</a>  so that's regarding a revolving account, so the term is called unclassified for its general expenditures for the particular account. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=282.591s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=284.958s">On</a>  the next page, 8 of 17, I had a question regarding school, a third of the way down, under Trotter-Richard, $290.12 school committee superintendent's dues.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=301.011s">So</a>  he was part of the superintendent's conference, MAASC, this year, and he was part of the hosting of the CCSR project down for the Cape, so that was reimbursement for some of his</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=314.06s">expenses</a>  Okay, I know that mr. Trotter retired from the school district and is still is he the director of the CCS are still yes And so he would go to that before the CCS are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=328.87s">Okay,</a>  just just clarifying but further down the row Christine Sweeney for the amount of $250 lost books I've had deductibles and</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=343.126s">Yes,</a>  so that would have been a reimbursement from that revolving account.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=348.51s">And</a>  then on page 10 of 17, fourth one down, CT book holdings, it says pending classification.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=363.686s">Again,</a>  this is another separate fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=367.329s">It's</a>  a trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=369.091s">So</a>  it doesn't have a particular breakout. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=371.433s">It's</a>  just one line for expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=373.335s">So</a>  it's considered unclassified based on what they're using it for.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=376.537s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=378.199s">In</a>  that, oh, one more, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=382.483s">On</a>  page 14 of 17, second one down. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=386.943s">It</a>  says $1,868 undistributed errors and omissions for RR Rudy insurance.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=395.63s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=395.97s">That's</a>  insurance errors and omissions insurance for school committee policies.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=400.514s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=401.795s">I</a>  just, when it said undistributed, I just, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=405.598s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=405.959s">Those</a>  are all my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=407.12s">Thank</a>  you for always answering them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=408.981s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=409.942s">There's</a>  a motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=411.663s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=411.904s">Vandekloot,</a>  you have to hit your button. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=414.185s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=414.386s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=418.157s">We</a>  have a new system up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=419.278s">We're</a>  trying to get into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=420.999s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=421.139s">Van</a>  Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=421.679s">Christine,</a>  I'm only mentioning this just so that in your records it doesn't cause you a problem down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=428.203s">You've</a>  got a typo on page 10 of 17, Greater Boston League. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=432.946s">It</a>  should be G-R-E-A rather than A-E.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=438.889s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=439.209s">So</a>  that is the vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=440.75s">So</a>  we'll get that adjusted and corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=442.351s">Yeah,</a>  just a typo. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=443.131s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=443.512s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=489.011s">So</a>  good evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=490.472s">I'd</a>  like to say welcome back to year two for me, but an exciting new school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=496.674s">I</a>  can't believe how time flies by. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=499.455s">I've</a>  had the honor of serving as your superintendent for a full year now, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work together as we move the Medford public schools forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=511.33s">We</a>  are one Medford, one district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=513.431s">A</a>  new school year always brings with it new members of our school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=518.795s">So</a>  I would like to take this opportunity just to officially introduce some of our new administrators that are here with us today and recognize them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=527.781s">If</a>  you are here, please feel free to stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=531.503s">Our</a>  new assistant superintendent, Dr. Peter Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=535.025s">who</a>  will be focusing on our secondary, middle, and high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=538.628s">Our</a>  new Director of Pupil Services, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=541.111s">Joan</a>  Bowen, who replaced Kathleen Madaglio, who retired in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=546.455s">And</a>  for the past six years, Director Bowen served as the coordinator of secondary special education and transition programs for the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=557.0s">We</a>  have a new assistant principal at the Andrews Middle School, Julia McEwen, who replaced Dave DiMattea, who retired in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=568.008s">At</a>  the Curtis Tufts School, we have a new principal, Miss Lisa Kingsley, who began her duties officially today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=575.573s">She</a>  replaces Brian Toomey, who transitioned to a new role in another district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=581.833s">We'd</a>  like to recognize Alice Beth Fitzpatrick, a Medford High School guidance Councilor, who was appointed as assistant director of CTE programs for the Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=595.218s">Maureen</a>  Lavin, who is a veteran and middle and high school educator in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=601.22s">She</a>  was appointed to temporarily fill the director of guidance position to cover a long-term leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=608.103s">Lisa</a>  Ionelli, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=610.015s">who</a>  was appointed our coordinator of secondary special education programs at the high school, replacing Joan Bowen's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=618.106s">And</a>  we'd like to recognize Lauren Perillo. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=621.24s">who</a>  was appointed coordinator of special education programs at the Columbus, McGlynn, and Andrews middle schools, replacing Lisa Ionelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=631.385s">So</a>  we had a lot of movement happening, but I just wanted us to take this time to formally welcome all of our new additions to the Mustang family. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=647.672s">So</a>  at this time, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=649.984s">Over</a>  the course of the summer and at the start of the school year, we had many, many wonderful partners from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=659.006s">Team</a>  Medford and other parts of the community that are supporting our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=669.054s">And</a>  we wanted to recognize and say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=672.737s">And</a>  so some of our wonderful community partners have actually come out today to give us this opportunity to recognize them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=682.505s">So</a>  I wanted to ask if Miss Diane Caldwell could come forward <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=686.772s">just</a>  so that we could formally thank the many friends and partners who have supported Medford Public Schools in a very generous way.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=696.515s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=696.796s">Caldwell.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=700.517s">Thank</a>  you and welcome back everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=702.197s">It's</a>  really good to be back, although I don't really feel like I left that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=708.295s">So</a>  we are so very lucky to have partnerships with various different corporations and companies in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=717.74s">But</a>  I'd like the team to please, all of you, come up now, starting with Sam Tarabelsi. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=724.884s">Sam</a>  has been with Hallmark Health, and Sam, this is our 12th year? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=730.978s">12th</a>  year and counting, we never let Sam go. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=733.539s">I</a>  remember Beverly Nelson saying for many, many years that she can't wait for the phone call from Mr. Terrabelsi to say, we're coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=743.125s">What</a>  all of these incredible people do behind us, and I know that you have the list.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=747.247s">I'm</a>  going to say their names. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=748.388s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=748.788s">Sam</a>  Terrabelsi, who's the director of infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=752.671s">Miss</a>  Sue Sandberg, who's the CEO. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=755.912s">Can</a>  you please wave so everyone knows who you are? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=757.813s">Thank</a>  you, Sue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=759.415s">We</a>  have with us Janet Peralt. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=762.296s">Thank</a>  you, Janet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=763.556s">We</a>  have from WB Mason, Stephanie Altavesta. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=767.897s">And</a>  from Armstrong Ambulance, Mr. Davin Forse, operations manager.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=780.081s">So</a>  as you know, the beginning of the school year is always difficult for some of our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=785.625s">In</a>  our school buildings, when we know we have 150 to 200 backpacks just jam-packed with school supplies and materials for our students, not only does that help our kiddos, it really helps the teachers and the families of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=805.577s">And</a>  so every year we welcome them back with open arms and say, thank you so much for all you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=813.001s">Mr.</a>  Terrabelsi, would you like to say a few words?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=816.936s">Thank</a>  you again, Diane. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=818.257s">It's</a>  always a pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=819.237s">I</a>  go back 12 years ago when I first said that we're doing this for the first year, and that I will be back. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=827.502s">So</a>  I kind of meant it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=828.983s">And</a>  I hope I continue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=832.565s">So</a>  really, it's a pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=833.705s">I</a>  mean, these guys, again, from WB Mason, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=838.288s">our</a>  new partner and really major sponsor. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=842.351s">We</a>  have Armstrong who is on our team but always there for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=846.734s">And</a>  then my teammate in the team at Medford that we go out to all the community events and we really <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=853.578s">And</a>  this is a special event for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=855.76s">I</a>  mean, it's back to school drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=857.381s">That</a>  really gets me excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=859.902s">And</a>  I'm always thinking ways to contribute to the cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=864.585s">We</a>  also have the Method Kiwanis that, you know, even though I'm a member, I can really kind of get the money out of these guys to really contribute to these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=873.371s">And</a>  they've been tremendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=875.012s">Tremendous.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=876.033s">We've</a>  had the Rotary in the past, and we will continue to get sponsored. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=879.615s">But</a>  most importantly, again, and I want to make sure, our CEO, Sue Sandberg, who joined our organization, Meadows Wakefield Healthcare, and really, you know, to take the time and to be here, so special to me, to Janet, to all of us, because it really means a lot to us that we're doing the right thing for the community and for the students and for the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=900.808s">So,</a>  anyway, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=902.789s">Sue,</a>  do you want to say a few words?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=909.279s">Okay,</a>  now I know you guys have been here a long time, so I would just say, I'm like you, I've been in the role now a year, and I still get giddy, though, when I hear first day of school, back from the days my kids started. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=920.825s">But</a>  I will just say Melrose-Wakefield Healthcare really is committed to a community, and when you talk about supporting children, they are our future, so we are so glad to stand up, and to stand up with Armstrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=933.532s">We</a>  get to work with them on a daily basis around patient care, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=937.379s">So</a>  it's fun to be in a project like this where it's about the future of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=942.622s">And</a>  they're the ones that will be taking care of us in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=946.764s">And</a>  of course, it's fun to have someone that we actually buy material from to step up and also help donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=953.508s">So</a>  it's fun to have partners and our vendors too. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=956.249s">So</a>  appreciate everyone here tonight and wishing you guys just a most awesome school year ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=962.713s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=963.533s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=970.387s">On</a>  behalf of the school committee, we want to thank Team Medford for all of your work and really being there year in and year out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=976.396s">It</a>  means so much, not only to us, but the children of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=979.88s">So</a>  thank you all very, very much.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=989.853s">I</a>  also have a few additional pointers that I want to just bring up as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=997.555s">When</a>  I mentioned the extreme generosity, the generosity of the business community has been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1005.377s">In</a>  addition to what Team Medford just presented, their sincere dedication to us, we also received a generous donation from Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1015.76s">of</a>  200 backpacks that were filled with school supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1020.744s">And</a>  they came to the school and dropped them off and backpacks were sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1026.308s">And</a>  in addition to Wegmans, we had another partner, a friend of the community, a Jero that has been working with Medford Public Schools for a very, very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1036.495s">They</a>  also donated an additional 200 backpacks with school supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1047.199s">And</a>  as we present additional reports to you this evening, you'll continue to hear our partners and how we say thank you to Joseph's Transportation and many other good partners in the community that are supporting what's happening in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1065.305s">Over</a>  the summer, we had two first ever events. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1068.466s">Many</a>  of you were able to come and support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1070.907s">We</a>  had our sixth grade welcome barbecue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1073.887s">And</a>  we had our summer Medford High School graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1077.69s">So</a>  I just wanted to mention that in my opening remarks to thank all of you who were able to support us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1084.034s">It</a>  was a fun event. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1085.476s">We</a>  were very grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1087.477s">The</a>  weather was very cooperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1089.919s">We</a>  were working hard, working collaboratively as a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1093.842s">And</a>  both principals, Principal Tucci and Principal Downs, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1097.422s">Associate</a>  Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Director of Curriculum Bernadette Riccidelli, Andrew's Assistant Principal Julia McEwen, and McGlynn Assistant Principal Jody Lu, our Public Relations Director Lisa Evangelista, school committee members Kathy Crux, Mia Mastone, Paulette VanderKloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1119.549s">They</a>  were able to jump in and help serve that day with food. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1124.722s">We</a>  want to thank the city's Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1128.003s">They</a>  came out, they cleared the area, they cleaned it, made it ready for the barbecue, and they came back and they collected whatever trash was left over. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1137.227s">So</a>  we're truly appreciative of the collaborative effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1140.009s">And</a>  once again, Wegmans stepped up and Wegmans provided, graciously provided all the water and sports drinks to all of our students for that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1151.634s">And</a>  we had a collaborative effort of both PTOs, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1155.03s">middle</a>  school PTOs, parents chipping in to make it such a wonderful event, and teachers working as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1161.973s">So</a>  we were really, really appreciative of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1164.534s">And</a>  our high school graduation, summer graduation, thank you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1168.877s">for</a>  supporting that event, the headmaster, and all that happened, and you'll hear about that later today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1176.883s">But</a>  what I can say is that those students who graduated, they got to feel like they were Mustangs, and Mustangs never give up, even if it was a little later. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1188.052s">But</a>  we're really proud of them, and I thank you again, the school committee, for your support during the summer months for that special event. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1196.94s">I</a>  just want to say I'm wrapping up, but today we had another first in our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1202.025s">Today</a>  was the first time we had middle school sports tryouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1206.15s">So</a>  stay tuned. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1207.131s">You'll</a>  be hearing more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1208.952s">But</a>  our middle school students had the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1211.969s">to</a>  participate in cross country, baseball, and softball. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1216.674s">So</a>  tryouts are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1218.436s">And</a>  as you know, we're part of the Greater Boston League, which includes Malden, Everett, Somerville, and Revere. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1226.125s">So</a>  we're excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1228.107s">And</a>  the first game is September 16th, so you'll continue to hear about what's happening with sports, all things middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1235.81s">And</a>  last but not least, this is a quick follow-up to one of our students that graduated class of 2017, a very proud Mustang, Mr. Joseph Farrar. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1249.108s">And</a>  at the end of the school year, last school year, we mentioned that he was working, he was part of the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1256.216s">Our</a>  director of science, Rocco Sieri, had talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1259.078s">But</a>  I just wanted to give you a highlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1262.062s">We</a>  are beyond proud that Joseph Farah, a 2017 graduate of Medford High School, and currently a physics major, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1271.159s">and</a>  at the Honors College of UMass Boston is sharing in a $3 million breakthrough prize. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1279.989s">I</a>  just felt it was worthy of announcing to all of you for being part of the Event Horizon Telescope, the EHT. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1289.118s">collaboration</a>  that took the first image of a black hole in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1294.523s">When</a>  the image was recorded, Farrah was the only undergraduate on the 347-member team. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1304.351s">As</a>  UMass Chancellor Newman stated, what a remarkable scientific achievement for an undergraduate to have contributed to a landmark discovery <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1314.7s">of</a>  this importance is nothing short of astounding. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1318.583s">UMass</a>  Boston is immensely proud of Joseph Farris' gifts and simply delighted that he has been recognized by this award. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1328.169s">So</a>  I want to say to all of you, yes, let's give him a round of applause. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1334.531s">I</a>  am looking forward to another great year, and as always, go Mustangs.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1339.292s">Go</a>  Patriots. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1340.493s">Thank</a>  you so much, Madam Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1343.094s">Could</a>  you also prepare thank yous for all of the various partners from the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1347.715s">Yes,</a>  definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1348.375s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1348.715s">It's</a>  a motion to receive this report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1352.757s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1354.077s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1354.777s">Motion</a>  carries.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1357.258s">Could</a>  we invite Joseph Farah to come <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1361.345s">and</a>  give him a commendation for his work and his accomplishment and bring him back into the Medford fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1370.09s">I</a>  know his family very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1371.491s">His</a>  brother is also a Medford High School student. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1376.034s">The</a>  whole family has <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1378.155s">has</a>  excelled in science throughout their career. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1381.497s">One</a>  of their children graduated with my daughter, Una, and they're a remarkable family. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1386.739s">And</a>  if we could do some type of presentation for him and bring him back and show all of MedFed how proud we are of our students that step out, because if he's at UMass Boston, he's around, and I think his family would love something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1400.766s">We</a>  need to celebrate what's happening in MedFed in a big way. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1404.768s">We</a>  can definitely do that.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1406.049s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1406.729s">Dr.</a>  Cushing is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1408.069s">He's</a>  going to push play.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1409.67s">We</a>  have a couple of others in the queue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1411.591s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1411.791s">Kreatz,</a>  did you wish to speak on this?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1414.572s">No,</a>  I wanted to say it was great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1416.153s">I</a>  got to meet him at one of the science fairs and it's just so amazing and it's incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1421.955s">What</a>  a great story.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1424.136s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1424.636s">And</a>  Mr. Ruggiero.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1427.108s">I</a>  think it would be great if we could have a little presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1430.35s">I've</a>  seen some of the pictures of the Event Horizon Telescope and it's just amazing to actually see a black hole surrounded by all of this plasma. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1438.315s">It</a>  would be great if we could get a presentation to our middle school students to get them excited.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1442.217s">So</a>  here is a very short, short video. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1447.78s">Five</a>  minutes on our opening of school.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1509.72s">I'm</a>  here with us today, Mayor Stephanie Burke.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1539.593s">This</a>  is a Super Bowl for our students, that we're going to be the best we can possibly be. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1561.262s">So</a>  that was my theme, my words of encouragement this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1565.644s">I</a>  know you can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1566.744s">I</a>  know we can do it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1575.245s">First</a>  day of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1575.766s">I'm</a>  excited.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1875.292s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1875.912s">How</a>  are you all? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1877.988s">Hey,</a>  we just want to say that Impact Church is super excited to be partnering with this community, with Medford, and with your schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1884.75s">We</a>  have the same mission as the rest of the Medford community, and that's purely just building up families and doing that through equitable education. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1892.733s">We</a>  also have <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1894.494s">A</a>  strong belief that faith and education can work really awesomely together and that you can't have one without the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1900.715s">And</a>  that faith can fuel education, but you also really need education in your faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1905.777s">So</a>  we as a church believe that these two communities just can go beautifully together and it really is our pleasure to donate and to be part of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1915.839s">So</a>  we just want to say thank you for allowing us to be in that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1919.82s">And</a>  we are so pumped to just keep partnering with Medford and with your school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1923.561s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1938.908s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1939.288s">And</a>  while I have the microphone, too, as well, I also want to thank Impact Church and Pastor Zenzo for a wonderful donation of a welcome back luncheon for our teachers and faculty the first day back from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1948.512s">So</a>  we're so thankful to have them as wonderful stewards of our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1952.074s">And</a>  I thank you very much for your consideration.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1993.935s">How</a>  are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1994.755s">I</a>  didn't prepare any official statement, but I do after reading mr. Tucci I wouldn't mind reading from my letter here to the community members about the event yes and <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2004.244s">Perhaps</a>  that could go into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2006.428s">So</a>  it is our responsibility to provide students with the opportunity to think outside the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2011.837s">As</a>  a Medford High teacher and the founder and executive director of M3 Outdoor Adventures, a new <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2017.092s">Local</a>  nonprofit organization, I'm calling upon my communities to spread awareness about our mission to get young people outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2023.957s">M3</a>  Outdoor Adventures, or M3OA as I like to call it, was founded in 2019 as a youth-centered recreation program linking students in the greater Boston area to the natural world. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2034.704s">M3OA</a>  mission <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2036.077s">is</a>  to increase student engagement and experience with local green spaces in order to encourage a lifetime of stewardship and appreciation for the outdoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2044.246s">We</a>  are seeking to create and maintain a network of multiple school-based clubs that will work in unison to help students from our schools engage in learning outside the classroom walls. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2055.088s">To</a>  support our mission, students and the M3AO staff will be hosting our major fall fundraiser event on October 27th, the October Fells Trail Races and Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2063.711s">This</a>  event was formerly known as the Fall for the Fells in years past. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2068.452s">It</a>  has attracted 150 runners and over 300 total attendees, and creating significant funding for the support of the outdoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2075.394s">With</a>  your help, we would like to make October Fells 2019 even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2079.215s">Two</a>  local, well-known businesses in Somerville and Medford have already agreed to help make October Fells a success. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2084.779s">Red</a>  Bones BBQ will be providing the food, and Medford Brewing Company will provide adult refreshment. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2090.103s">With</a>  your additional support, this year's race will be a great stride forward to getting young people of our communities outside.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2097.745s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2098.566s">And</a>  for all of those that do not know Mr. Tower, he also organized the canoe, the Cabo Canoe Race at Wrights Pond at the beginning of the season, which is just a fabulous event. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2107.936s">Tons</a>  of students are involved and teachers, and it really is a great experience for everyone that participates in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2114.904s">And</a>  I believe, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2116.105s">Stone,</a>  did you want to add a couple of comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2117.827s">No?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2119.288s">I</a>  do want to say I didn't do it alone Kevin Bailey from the Medford rec department has been a great help Oh, yes, I mean, I hope it's a great success just like the cardboard canoe it's just so much fun</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2133.171s">And</a>  I've been to the fall fells with my dog last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2138.074s">And</a>  we had a blast. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2139.235s">And</a>  he just loved, enjoyed just walking around in the falls. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2142.137s">And</a>  it sounds like it's going to be a great success. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2144.459s">And</a>  I'm all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2147.281s">I</a>  make a motion to accept.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2148.962s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2149.582s">Kress.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2151.463s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2151.784s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2152.684s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2153.145s">I</a>  just had a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2154.425s">Sure,</a>  ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2154.966s">What</a>  time of day is your event?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2156.767s">It</a>  starts at 11 and should be wrapped up by 4 o'clock.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2161.13s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2163.664s">The</a>  expected crowd?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2166.708s">It's</a>  kind of weather dependent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2167.93s">I</a>  mean, I'm looking to get 150 runners, maybe 300 people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2171.855s">That</a>  seems to be the average that it's been. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2174.038s">It</a>  could be larger, it could be smaller.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2176.602s">And</a>  how much access to a facility will <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2180.341s">your</a>  group have?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2181.202s">So</a>  we have no indoor access. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2183.404s">We</a>  get access to the Field of Dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2187.648s">We</a>  have some access to the parking area. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2190.63s">I</a>  get some support from community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2192.472s">They</a>  help provide us with some tables and chairs and give us access to the porta-potties, but there's really no in-school access.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2198.338s">You</a>  bring in porta-potties so you don't have to enter the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2200.74s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2201.14s">and</a>  the building's secure and locked. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2203.201s">That's</a>  good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2204.743s">I</a>  just worry a little bit about security.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2206.884s">No,</a>  no, that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2207.865s">There's</a>  also, usually on the Sundays, there's swimming going on, and there's somebody who's kind of watching that door. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2214.429s">And</a>  I'm always in touch with the custodian, so we really don't have anybody going into this room.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2219.853s">And</a>  prep and cleanup will be done by your group?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2221.994s">Yep,</a>  we do it.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2224.236s">I</a>  still have a few more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2226.615s">So</a>  all of those seem very favorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2230.198s">And</a>  I know that you're applying for a liquor license on the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2232.879s">I</a>  just want to make sure that there's nothing left over. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2235.401s">It</a>  is a school grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2238.003s">I</a>  just want to make sure someone walks around.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2239.744s">Of</a>  course, we're really particular about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2242.326s">I</a>  work with the local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2243.707s">We</a>  hire a police detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2245.448s">We</a>  have staff surrounding and checking IDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2251.243s">I</a>  would say official, and there's nothing to be left about.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2254.945s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2255.966s">I</a>  had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2257.127s">Do</a>  they register through community schools so we know who's using our facilities for liability purposes? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2264.612s">Not</a>  so much for you through the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2267.554s">You</a>  know how they have to apply to use any facility? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2270.136s">I</a>  just want to make sure that that paperwork's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2272.397s">and</a>  those applications in that format are logged in so that way we know what time they're coming, what time they're leaving, what the name of the group, who the responsible person is. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2282.105s">If</a>  there's an issue, we have a contact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2284.327s">Any</a>  group, even if we donate any part of any of our schools, should be filling that out just so if something were to happen or found later, we can have someone <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2294.737s">We</a>  have the documentation to reach out correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2297.981s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2301.084s">And</a>  I don't see any reason for this not to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2304.468s">My</a>  other question is, do we rent that facility to a church on Sundays? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2308.313s">And</a>  how is the parking going to interact? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2311.276s">Because</a>  I think they have a service.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2314.858s">Yeah,</a>  they've used the front recently, and parking hasn't been, they've been, I think, out before. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2320.122s">We've</a>  kind of had a crash of people in there, but it seems to have worked out.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2325.766s">And</a>  have we notified them that this will be happening in the timing, so that way, you know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2330.83s">I</a>  would assume that community schools, Mr. Maloney. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2334.453s">We'll</a>  definitely let them know.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2336.054s">Because</a>  I know that other people in the community have asked to do road races and use that area, and timing has been an issue, and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2344.36s">that</a>  their service is either 11.30 or 12, I'm not positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2349.769s">So</a>  as long as the timing is worked out, it's just something that has to be followed up on because we have steady renters and we just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2358.099s">that</a>  it works and it's safe parking and people are only parking where it's appropriate, not on the field, out and back where the kids practice football. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2367.607s">If</a>  all those concessions are put in place, especially logging in and noting that it can be free but it has to be logged that you're using the facility and who the contact people are and people are there in place, I have no problem with it and I make a motion to second.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2385.036s">My</a>  motion on the floor offered by his credit seconded by Mister Benedetto is being to</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2391.437s">Mr.</a>  Tower, thank you for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2393.579s">I</a>  just, I didn't catch, I heard Red Bones. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2396.201s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2397.042s">And</a>  then I didn't hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2397.982s">Medford</a>  Brewing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2398.603s">Medford</a>  Brewing Company.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2399.523s">So</a>  Medford Brewing Company will be supplying the liquor? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2402.506s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2402.986s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2403.427s">Beer.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2403.867s">No</a>  liquor.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2404.407s">Beer.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2404.728s">Beer.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2405.108s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2405.608s">Okay,</a>  well it's a liquor permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2406.789s">Yeah,</a>  I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2407.99s">So</a>  it's beer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2408.671s">They</a>  don't have beer permits, I don't think, but I would have got one of those.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2411.533s">Okay,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2413.134s">My</a>  guess is if you're advertising that, you'll expect to get more than 300 people, so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2418.093s">Well,</a>  you'd be surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2419.395s">I</a>  mean, unfortunately, I'm weather dependent, and I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2421.877s">If</a>  it's raining, it's going to be a tough act.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2423.879s">The</a>  27th is a Sunday?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2425.281s">It's</a>  a Sunday.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2426.042s">So</a>  weather dependent on?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2427.483s">Well,</a>  I mean, I'm going to host it, rain or shine, but if the weather's not nice, no one's going to sit around and have a beer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2431.888s">They're</a>  going to go home.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2432.929s">But</a>  you registered beforehand anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2434.731s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2435.933s">Is</a>  there a walkers? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2437.314s">There</a>  is.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2437.915s">Well,</a>  there's like a one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2438.875s">You</a>  can walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2439.876s">There's</a>  also a handicap accessible 1K, like a family fun race. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2443.758s">This</a>  is something I've been working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2445.619s">We've</a>  been doing it with Friends of the Fells, but it was a little chaotic. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2448.14s">So</a>  now we have a route planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2449.241s">And</a>  I've been working with the DCR to make sure that the route has less of an environmental impact, which in the previous years, all of the racing has happened in the Lawrence Woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2459.027s">And</a>  whether you're familiar with that area, doing a 10K in the Lawrence Woods means you're crossing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2464.93s">It's</a>  almost like a maze. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2467.011s">So</a>  now, we've expanded the course to go across into South Border Road, and that should make the course easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2474.037s">And</a>  we also are looking to have a stroller-friendly 1K for kids.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2479.941s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2480.442s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2480.902s">OK,</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2482.143s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2482.503s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2484.305s">And</a>  on the motion, with the amendments that were offered, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2488.568s">Mustone,</a>  please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2497.011s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2498.793s">We</a>  wish you the best of luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2499.794s">If</a>  you need any help publicizing, let us know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2502.137s">I</a>  will. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2502.497s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2503.318s">Much</a>  appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2504.399s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2507.038s">Miss,</a>  hit your button, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2509.179s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2510.08s">When</a>  I was at the cardboard canoe races, I thought of a really good idea, like the school committee and the city council should each make a canoe next year and participate in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2522.047s">I</a>  thought it would be a lot of fun for the kids to see and the community as a whole, and we should join in on the fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2528.01s">So</a>  I don't know if my colleagues are interested, but I thought it might be something we should plan for the beginning of next year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2538.145s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2539.146s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. Tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2541.828s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2542.328s">Okay,</a>  report on administrative meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2545.17s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2545.511s">Caldwell.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2568.49s">Well,</a>  good evening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2569.531s">So</a>  the week of August 19th through August 23rd was a busy week for both administrators and new teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2577.095s">I</a>  won't go through the list of our new administrators because Dr. Vincent has already introduced them to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2583.218s">Once</a>  again, Superintendent Vincent welcomed our administrators back on August 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2588.547s">She</a>  outlined her plans and expectations for the upcoming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2593.131s">Our</a>  administrators had an assignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2594.892s">They</a>  were to read two books, Good to Great, and Culturally Responsive Teaching, and they reported back. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2601.157s">Dr.</a>  Vincent continues to demonstrate to all her passion for education, and we're lucky to have her in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2609.267s">Our</a>  thanks to Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli for providing her expertise and assistance for all the work she completed over the summer vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2617.054s">She</a>  collected and organized our educator evaluations, organized professional development for the upcoming school year, and planned our new teacher <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2626.703s">week</a>  induction program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2628.804s">I</a>  want to say a big thank you to all of our principals who worked really hard over the summer, as well as Building and Grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2634.807s">John</a>  McLaughlin and his crew made our buildings beautiful and safe to be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2641.411s">We</a>  also had a very busy summer hiring staff, preparing materials, and scheduling students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2647.434s">At</a>  our administrative meetings, we discussed topics and matters of concern for the upcoming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2655.075s">Assistant</a>  Superintendent and Director of Finance, Christine Patterson, updated the ASOP frontline system, payroll automation, and the employee portal, as well as the bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2666.458s">Once</a>  again, Dr. Rigodelli discussed our new teacher induction week and evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2672.16s">Other</a>  themes of the week included professional development, personnel, school emergency plans, special education updates, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2680.806s">medical</a>  forms, and specific updates from curriculum directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2686.209s">For</a>  instance, our Director of Mathematics, Faiza Khan, discussed illustrative mathematics in our middle schools, and Director of Science, Rocco Sieri, continues to discuss our new elementary fall science curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2699.136s">Director</a>  of Speech and Language, Susanna Campbell, updated our administrators on the new screener pilot grant for the Columbus Elementary School, and we'll give you a report on that, maybe in a few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2710.971s">as</a>  well as three of our elementary education staff who were accepted into DESE's Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, and Dysgraphia professional development workshops this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2722.926s">Assistant</a>  Superintendent Peter Cushing contacted Rebus Consultants who provided professional development on the educator evaluation tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2731.154s">Century</a>  Bank hosted our administrators offering a continental breakfast as well as a delicious lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2737.58s">We</a>  would like to extend our thanks to the Sloan family and Mr. Flynn for hosting our administrative team and especially to Lisa Evangelista for contacting <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2749.17s">Century</a>  Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2750.651s">So</a>  I've provided an agenda for you for review for each of the days. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2755.074s">We</a>  were really busy Monday through Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2757.695s">Had</a>  a wonderful time at the barbecue, and I'll let Bernadette talk to you more about what she did with our new teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2765.44s">I'd</a>  be happy to answer any questions.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2768.202s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2768.482s">DiBenedetto.</a> </p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2769.703s">First</a>  of all, I want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2774.546s">It's</a>  not on, Erin? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2777.367s">Is</a>  it on? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2778.992s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2780.432s">Over</a>  the summer, I know that there's a strong group here in works all summer through, and it's appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2787.233s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2787.813s">So</a>  that when the kids come back and the teachers come back, you're ready for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2791.994s">I</a>  just have a few questions about some items that you talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2795.575s">How</a>  are our administrators evaluated? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2798.035s">And</a>  are they evaluated annually in a similar format to the teachers?</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2803.456s">So</a>  all of our administrators are evaluated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2806.517s">Dr.</a>  Bernadette Riccadeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2808.897s">So</a>  it divvies up to Dr. Vincent, myself, and others who they are going to evaluate. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2816.479s">So</a>  for instance, elementary education is my background, so I evaluate all of the elementary principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2822.941s">I'm</a>  also the director of Title I, so I evaluate all of the Title I staff and some literacy staff as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2830.383s">And</a>  Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli does a wonderful job at divvying up different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2836.413s">And</a>  it is similar to our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2839.316s">We</a>  have formative and summative evaluations. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2843.219s">The</a>  rubric, however, is very different for administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2846.142s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2846.802s">And</a>  your evaluations are done by the superintendent on an annual basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2851.626s">For</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2852.587s">For</a>  top administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2853.949s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2854.729s">And</a>  that's done annually in a similar rubric? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2857.051s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2857.592s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2858.392s">I</a>  just want to make sure we do it fairly for the whole district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2864.004s">I</a>  had a few questions about specific, I got a note from a parent regarding the dyslexic reading committee and how parents might be able to join that committee.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2875.609s">So</a>  I think Susanna Campbell is chairing that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2879.331s">You</a>  might want to suggest that they contact her. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2883.353s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2883.653s">Nicole</a>  Chiesa will be on that committee as well.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2888.555s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2889.295s">Also,</a>  you know, there was still some, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2894.025s">some</a>  questions about evidence-based programming, but I'll speak with them directly about that, or maybe when we get after the training and you do an update to us about the training.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2907.689s">Yeah,</a>  I absolutely will do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2909.89s">The</a>  training takes place <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2911.892s">in</a>  September, October, maybe the beginning of November. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2915.334s">We're</a>  hoping to do a train-the-trainers model, so there are teachers at the McGlynn that are being trained, and then they in turn will train our other elementary teachers.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2924.501s">And</a>  how about the dyslexia evaluation? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2928.023s">Are</a>  those currently happening on our new kindergartners? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2931.486s">Do</a>  we purchase that? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2933.207s">that</a>  program, remember last year?</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2936.328s">We</a>  discussed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2937.168s">We</a>  haven't purchased a program for that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2939.928s">We</a>  are working on a new, Desi asked certain communities to write a grant, and Susanna and myself and Nicole wrote a grant, and right now we are piloting over at the Columbus Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2952.93s">It's</a>  called MAPS Growth.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2954.871s">MAPS</a>  Growth?</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2955.771s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2958.131s">Interestingly</a>  enough, the person in charge of this is a woman named Martha Coakley, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2963.585s">from</a>  Medfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2966.867s">I</a>  asked her if she often gets emails, and she said she does.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2971.889s">I</a>  just, after the conversations we had last year, I thought we were implementing an evaluation for incoming kindergartners this year to evaluate where they were with dyslexia. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2983.415s">And</a>  then we were going to take that until DESE provided us more information at the end of this year for the following years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2992.068s">Did</a>  that, that did not happen?</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2993.589s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2994.089s">I'd</a>  have to look through my notes on that, Mr. Benedetto, to see if we said we would implement a tool in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2999.851s">The</a>  Department of Education still is very unclear about what they're doing.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3004.092s">But</a>  this committee voted to move forward and it was between a checklist that teacher observed and checked off or an actual assessment that assessed the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3017.682s">is</a>  my memory and I thought we were moving forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3020.705s">I'd</a>  like to go back and if we're not, I think we need to relook at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3023.667s">I</a>  actually thought it was in the budget for this year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3027.51s">So</a>  maybe the superintendent could put it on the agenda for next week and we can like talk before that next meeting and we could talk about that and make sure that we're all clear about what's happening with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3040.061s">And</a>  my last item is the new math program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3043.703s">I</a>  did get some calls about that and I was a little I reached out to the superintendent about making sure El in special education teachers had a teaching book and I think that's happening, but I just want to make sure that the colored paper that the teachers need to <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3063.815s">to</a>  operate this, and the manipulatives are available to all our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3069.199s">So</a>  I would request that we put this on the agenda and have the director come forward and see how it's going so far, see if we have enough money to sustain us for all those new needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3083.017s">and</a>  the paper volume, and just maybe an update on how it's going since it's a brand new program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3089.101s">And</a>  I would also suggest have an update from Rocco as well on the new science program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3094.845s">I</a>  know that he gets a lot of things in the mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3097.587s">And</a>  I haven't heard anything from anyone about that, but I'd love to celebrate that as well.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3102.391s">Well,</a>  I'm sure he would. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3103.531s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3103.972s">Khan</a>  is planning to be here next week to give you an update on the map.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3106.834s">Oh,</a>  perfect timing then. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3107.934s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3109.462s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3111.048s">Again,</a>  thank you for all the work that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3113.255s">I</a>  know it's been a tremendous.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3115.703s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3116.462s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3116.782s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3118.063s">I</a>  just wanted to comment that I agree with Erin that I was under the impression that we weren't just doing a pilot program at one elementary school, but that the will of the school committee was to be very aggressive in moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3134.813s">There</a>  was some question about which would be the tool that we used, but I certainly, I wasn't thinking that we were just doing a pilot program <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3146.22s">At</a>  one school, I thought it would be that we certainly would be even if it wasn't at the beginning of the year, but it would that certainly at the very in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3156.73s">It</a>  was my recollection that the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3159.125s">really</a>  was very clear that we wanted an aggressive effort on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3164.408s">So</a>  I'll throw that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3165.969s">I'll</a>  look through my notes and see.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3167.27s">Madam</a>  Superintendent would like to respond.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3169.251s">Yes,</a>  we did say that there was a debate about which program we would work with and the timing and the training that it would require. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3180.579s">So</a>  we and then we pursued the grant as well with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3184.627s">So</a>  we were awarded that for one school only from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3189.535s">It's</a>  a different program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3191.198s">So</a>  we have not <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3195.142s">begun</a>  implementing the dyslexia screening as of right now, but that is what was said in the late spring, and we'll be able to pull up those records and get them for us for next time that we meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3210.286s">What</a>  were our next steps?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3213.406s">Yes,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3218.238s">We're</a>  at the beginning of the year, so I would just also like to ask for a report about the breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3224.081s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3224.302s">A</a>  parent approached me with concerns about <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3240.82s">She</a>  wondered what the kids were receiving to eat, because her child had come home and reported something that was concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3248.763s">She</a>  thought perhaps two should agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3251.203s">And</a>  so we just wanted to be clear on what the breakfast program is providing to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3257.625s">I'll</a>  absolutely do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3258.966s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3259.906s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3260.386s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3261.347s">And</a>  Mr. Ruggiero.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3264.454s">I</a>  want to get a sense of, do we have an idea of when the DESE guidelines will be coming out, or is that the state's unclear on that?</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3271.357s">Next</a>  year, actually.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3272.798s">It's</a>  a year.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3273.298s">The</a>  fall of next year, or winter of next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3276.32s">Very</a>  little guidance from DESE.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3277.921s">And</a>  do we have a sense, is there like a preliminary report that's going to be anticipated, or it's just all coming out at once?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3283.164s">There</a>  were different programs that DESE, with this particular grant, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3288.893s">I</a>  don't know if it was 20 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3290.855s">It</a>  was a limited number of communities that DESE was working with. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3295.118s">And</a>  again, Medford was selected to be one of those districts to pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3299.381s">So</a>  I truly believe they're going to take the data from this year of study. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3304.885s">There's</a>  a lot of professional development, a lot of communication with DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3309.088s">So</a>  I think as they're looking at the different communities that are piloting the different programs, based on that information, it's probably going to take at least a year to a year and a half for DESE to be able to say, based on the pilot districts and what the data yielded, which direction they're going to recommend the state moves in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3333.122s">So</a>  there is still going to be, there's this, I feel, a window of opportunity where even if you stop moving forward in one direction, a year's time to a year and a half, DESE could potentially say, let's course correct and start another path. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3351.232s">So</a>  we're kind of working with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3354.547s">and</a>  also just thinking about what our next steps need to continue to be.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3359.19s">Is</a>  it possible that we could have one of the administrators of the program come in to speak about what their game plan and their strategy is? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3365.113s">Because</a>  right now it seems like everyone's sort of unclear about where this is moving, and this is a very serious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3371.057s">I</a>  mean, we all were very moved by the presentation that came to us about dyslexia.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3376.96s">I</a>  think we are taking it seriously.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3379.262s">Oh,</a>  I have no doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3380.322s">I</a>  don't mean to imply that people aren't taking it seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3382.424s">It</a>  would just be helpful to me when people call me about the issue that I have more to report other than Desi is trying a bunch of stuff out in some different communities and we'll see in a year and a half.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3392.88s">I</a>  can definitely try to reach out to DESE to see if they would be able to come and talk about where they are with the status of dyslexia or what it is, how they're gathering the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3404.989s">So</a>  I can definitely work on that.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3406.51s">If</a>  they can't, send a personnel member, at least something they can write us, so at least we have a sense of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3412.635s">And</a>  I really appreciate both of you following up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3414.616s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3417.518s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3418.69s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3420.09s">I</a>  do remember that us being hesitant to buy something, but most of the programs that you're going to buy, you're going to use them for the kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3429.494s">And</a>  that's why we weren't going to wait for DESE to make their decision, because we as a committee felt it was too important. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3437.731s">to</a>  move forward and then we'll alter it as we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3442.373s">But</a>  my understanding was every kindergartner at this grade, at this year, was going to be tested and we weren't waiting because we don't want, that was a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3454.017s">So</a>  when you come forward, just please keep that in mind.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3456.998s">I</a>  wanna say, if my memory serves me correctly, and I need to go back and find that, I wanna say it was going to be the early fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3465.682s">We</a>  were waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3466.762s">for</a>  the kindergarten students to get the preliminary baseline screening, letter recognition, et cetera, to start the year off, and that the dyslexia screening was going to happen at the end <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3477.323s">of</a>  like the first term around that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3481.245s">So</a>  I'll definitely be able to gather that information and represent it to you or put it in your packets for you.</p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3507.722s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, and members of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3514.085s">I'm</a>  here tonight to deliver a report on the new teacher induction program that occurred between August 19th and 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3522.128s">So</a>  as Diane Caldwell mentioned, that was a very busy week. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3525.35s">We</a>  had two very busy concurrently run programs running on campus at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3532.473s">So</a>  the new teacher induction program was designed to introduce to our 48 new educators in the district, policies and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3542.861s">We</a>  wanted to familiarize them with the curricular programs and technological applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3547.645s">And</a>  most importantly, we wanted to acclimate them to Medford as a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3555.851s">And</a>  one thing that I noticed through the week is on that first day, and there were several of you there on that first day, and that room was really quiet, you could feel the tension, people were really nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3565.615s">And</a>  I want to tell you that as the week progressed, by Friday, you could see that relationships had formed, that people relaxed, and people were really feeling a connection to <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3576.651s">to</a>  the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3577.412s">So</a>  that I think was very welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3581.157s">And</a>  so I did see a lot of growth with the new staff during that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3587.378s">So</a>  we provided a lot of different activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3592.001s">So</a>  as you know, it was a five-day induction program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3595.623s">New</a>  staff participated in workshops on a variety of topics that included the use of technology and technology portals, mentoring, support, and guidance, educator evaluation process and expectations, sexual harassment awareness, curriculum and best instructional practices, social emotional learning, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3616.437s">and</a>  a safety care training. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3618.338s">So</a>  I've also included an agenda for all five days of the district, and as you can see, all of the different activities that occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3626.92s">I</a>  think it was comprehensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3629.201s">Last</a>  year we did a four-day training and gave teachers the fifth day as a classroom prep day. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3637.223s">This</a>  year we embedded classroom preparation in throughout the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3642.546s">We</a>  wanted to make it so that they would have support from their curriculum director, their building principal, and their mentor at the different times that they had their classroom preparation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3652.558s">One</a>  new thing that we added <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3654.493s">This</a>  year was a tour of Medford, and I will report that it was a success. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3660.179s">The</a>  anecdotal evidence to date has been very, very positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3665.105s">I</a>  cannot take the credit myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3666.846s">I</a>  have to thank Lisa Evangelista, and although not noted in the report, Nick Tucci had the idea, and I wish he was still here, but I do want to give him credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3676.717s">He</a>  said to me back in the spring, did you ever think about doing a tour of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3680.639s">And</a>  I thought it was a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3682.68s">We</a>  were able to make it happen this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3685.061s">So</a>  again, I want to thank Lisa Evangelista. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3688.283s">She</a>  made the calls to the Royal House, to Tufts University, to Colleen's. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3693.522s">to</a>  Dominic Camara, who helped fund the ice cream at Colleen's, to Lakasha's. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3699.508s">She</a>  did a wonderful job narrating the tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3702.952s">She</a>  has a strong knowledge of the history of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3707.637s">I</a>  was a social studies teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3709.098s">I</a>  like to think my knowledge of Medford history is pretty strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3712.902s">not</a>  compared to Lisa. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3714.083s">She</a>  had all of the anecdotal stories along with the real history to go with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3719.407s">And</a>  I think that the new educators were really, they appreciated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3724.992s">I</a>  do want to make, I just want to make sure I give everyone credit here, so I mentioned Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3730.656s">Rocco</a>  DiRico, who is at Tufts and his team, did an extraordinary job putting on a presentation and informing <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3741.443s">the</a>  new staff and to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3744.125s">I</a>  didn't know all that they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3745.706s">The</a>  outreach to the Medford community and all the resources that they have available. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3750.728s">They</a>  provided coffee and pastries and really made us feel welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3755.271s">LaCosche's,</a>  what a wonderful welcome they gave us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3758.073s">I</a>  mean, an open arm welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3759.814s">Welcome</a>  to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3761.214s">It</a>  was very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3763.536s">Colleen's</a>  the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3766.037s">Joseph's</a>  Transportation donated a bus at a very minimal cost to the district, so we were able to travel in comfort. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3775.184s">It</a>  was warm that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3776.245s">The</a>  bus was air conditioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3777.946s">We</a>  had the speaker, so Lisa was able to narrate the tour, and everyone was able to hear her. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3783.407s">So</a>  it's something that I'm hoping we can continue in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3787.91s">I</a>  also want to acknowledge Starbucks and West Medford for their contribution of coffee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3794.334s">Goldilocks</a>  Bagels, which I'm not sure if they've opened yet, but they were still practicing and they donated a lot of bagels to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3803.899s">The</a>  bagels were extraordinary, I must say. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3806.381s">And</a>  also for Wegmans for their generous donation of coffee and other treats <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3812.432s">for</a>  the group throughout the induction program week. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3815.455s">So</a>  again, I like to think that this program was balanced between process, procedure, people, and again, acclimating people to feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3827.688s">and</a>  to be part of the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3829.97s">I'm</a>  happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3832.091s">Thank</a>  you very much, Dr. Riccadeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3833.893s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3834.533s">Is</a>  there a motion to receive this report and place it on file by Mr. Rousseau, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3838.776s">DiBenedetto?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3839.397s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3840.958s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3841.718s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3845.221s">Next</a>  up, report on buildings and grounds, summer updates, Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3851.626s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3851.826s">Kreatz,</a>  did you want to speak on something? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3853.967s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3855.268s">Oh,</a>  for John, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3857.95s">Is</a>  it for John? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3858.771s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3861.894s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3863.175s">Good</a>  evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3866.798s">So,</a>  I'm always grateful for the support that we receive in Buildings and Grounds and this year was certainly no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3877.126s">And</a>  I'll start and I'll run through what we have been up to in some of the buildings and I'll take questions if you have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3886.086s">So</a>  at the Andrews School, with the help of the mayor's office, we were able to start to replace all of the. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3895.226s">the</a>  corroded cement curbing with the granite. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3899.59s">And</a>  the DPW did a fantastic job helping us out down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3905.655s">We</a>  also worked over at the McGlynn School as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3910.819s">And</a>  we had all the upholstery shampooed in the library and all the furniture this past summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3919.206s">As</a>  well as we have the gym's floors screened and varnished, as well as the custodians obviously doing a good job with the regular everyday summer type of cleaning that we perform. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3932.656s">The</a>  Brooks Elementary School, we're just about finished with the capital HVAC project that we've been up to over there, and we'll be getting that online very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3944.98s">And</a>  we had all of the rugs in every single classroom as well as the library shampooed this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3951.944s">The</a>  gym floors were refinished and the forestry department, we had <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3958.122s">a</a>  slight issue with some birds getting into some of the vents. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3961.243s">So</a>  between the forestry department, the electric department, our maintenance department, the custodians, we were able to climb up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3967.786s">We</a>  get up in the bucket and we were able to excavate the birds and put up screens. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3974.168s">So</a>  hopefully that doesn't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3975.749s">But</a>  that was certainly a health concern that we had for the kids and that we wanted to make sure that we did the best we could to rectify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3984.293s">And</a>  over at the Columbus, the compressors were replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3988.606s">The</a>  gym floor is refinished. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3990.586s">We</a>  had the roofer in doing maintenance as well this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3995.287s">And</a>  we have an issue in one of the offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3997.548s">It's</a>  getting a little bit of moisture. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3999.208s">So</a>  we're going to be in the process of adding a sump pump. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4001.929s">It</a>  was an office that's kind of underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4004.669s">And</a>  it was getting some moisture that was creating an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4007.41s">So</a>  we're going to be on that very, very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4010.551s">So</a>  we had the DAU computer replaced at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4013.851s">It</a>  went down today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4016.904s">film</a>  time, it's back up and running, so we'll keep a keen eye on that to make sure that we get that running, because we will, after the compressor project is completed, we'll have a punch list in the schools, in the various rooms, in the set points that we'll be running through, you know, to get everything back to original standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4038.593s">And</a>  then, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4042.034s">So</a>  at the McGlynn School, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4044.894s">We</a>  had the roofing contractor down there too doing maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4048.396s">And</a>  obviously the project from the mayor's office that we're replacing the granite curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4055.981s">We</a>  did finally get everybody together and get that slide in place down there, which was certainly one that the community had some interest in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4064.745s">And</a>  we- <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4069.568s">I</a>  know and I mean what people may not understand is that there's like one guy on the East Coast that does it and he was in Nantucket all summer putting together doing a big project so we were finally able to get him up here and <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4084.432s">And</a>  then when we were putting it in, there's a little bit of a drainage issue down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4088.276s">So</a>  the water kept filling up with water. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4090.598s">And</a>  we're trying to mount it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4092.279s">But</a>  we stayed on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4095.042s">And</a>  then that was another one that the DPW and the parks department really came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4101.127s">came</a>  in handy for that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4102.688s">They</a>  seem to really help us out a lot when we need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4108.193s">So</a>  we did end up getting that and we had the gym floor done but they missed the small gym and we're going to do that next week as well as we're going to do the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4119.501s">We're</a>  going to screen and re-varnish the floors in the theater which will make it look nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4124.325s">We</a>  have the <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4125.986s">The</a>  seating project's been delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4127.947s">They</a>  may not be able to get there till October because of the fact that the 16-week lead time on the upholstery for the chairs that we're going to be replacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4138.489s">But</a>  we're still pushing forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4141.79s">And</a>  then we would move on to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4144.49s">So</a>  they have the compressors. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4145.651s">They've</a>  been completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4146.451s">We're</a>  working on punch list. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4148.551s">The</a>  rugs in the gym floors were done as well over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4152.632s">Curtis</a>  Tufts, we were able to move in and do another one <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4157.294s">Floors</a>  we stripped off the 80-year-old varnish and we were in there working in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4162.996s">So</a>  that worked out well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4165.657s">But</a>  Buildings and Grounds is very grateful for the help they'll receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4172.48s">And</a>  people in the community and the school committee and everybody understands the value of maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4179.323s">And</a>  we're allowed to do these projects with the support of everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4184.565s">And</a>  Brian Karens and Steve Tanaglia, Mike Nesta, Steve Randazzo in the Electoral Department, Vinny in the Electoral Department, the custodians that are in the trenches every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4197.199s">And</a>  I know I mentioned the DPW and them a lot, but they do, they help us all the time, anytime we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4204.433s">anything</a>  on the outside, the forestry department was at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4208.035s">We</a>  were able to trim some trees to get some good security angles with cameras that we were really, really pushing to do that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4218.802s">And</a>  we had some landscaping done up the high school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4221.684s">We</a>  had the front where the sign is all redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4226.427s">The</a>  kiddie area that's in the west courtyard, it was all kind of grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4231.291s">So</a>  we had them come in and we had them scrape it down and put in the kid cushion mulch. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4236.494s">So</a>  now they're all set on that side too, which was, that was a good project too, that needed to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4243.559s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4244.04s">It's</a>  just all part of what we need to do, you know, on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4249.704s">But</a>  I'd like to take any questions if anybody has any.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4253.341s">I</a>  also just want to add a couple of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4255.762s">Three</a>  applications are made to the CPC, the CPA commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4260.524s">It's</a>  the playground at the Brooks, the Columbus, and at the McGlynn Complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4264.826s">So</a>  three applications went in from the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4267.608s">And</a>  I believe, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4268.348s">Patterson,</a>  the final application is due in a week or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4274.231s">So</a>  we need to make sure that that gets in on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4277.552s">But</a>  those already went through the preliminary process.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4279.533s">Excellent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4279.773s">And</a>  as soon as we hear back. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4283.764s">we</a>  will determine next steps for those three projects as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4289.6s">Hi,</a>  John.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4293.623s">Thank</a>  you very much for the very comprehensive report and thanks for getting back to me during the summer with different text messages that I sent you with pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4303.551s">You</a>  did a great job and everything looks really great and I also want to thank the DPW because I actually sent Steve Tenaglia a couple of messages and he took care of things immediately and it was really, really appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4318.203s">I</a>  just had a question because I was comparing this report to the to the year one from the capital improvement plan and Everything was going along and I was checking everything off and so there was a couple of items one of them was the Curtis Tufts the front steel well replacement and</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4334.312s">And</a>  did- Well, what we found, and I was speaking to Mayor Burke earlier, what we found was the money that we lauded for the project wasn't even close to what it's going to cost to do the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4346.6s">So</a>  we spoke about getting some quotes, and then we'll look at it from there and see where we can go with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4356.187s">Maybe</a>  we can fit it in this time around. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4359.509s">When</a>  we have a good number to shoot for, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4364.992s">we'll</a>  see if we can fit it in for the next time around, I hope.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4369.034s">Is</a>  there anything dangerous, like where somebody could trip on the snow? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4372.175s">No,</a>  no, no.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4372.995s">It's</a>  just, it's functional, but it's not necessarily aesthetically pleasing to a certain degree.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4380.678s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4382.219s">No</a>  safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4382.759s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4383.459s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4384.219s">And,</a>  oh, and then I did, you know, just recently I was asking about the, also was the, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4392.049s">repair</a>  the fire alarm system. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4394.871s">That</a>  was originally in our year one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4397.152s">And</a>  I know, I don't know if Christine Patterson wanted to come up and just explain that, that it was, so this is our plan, but it wasn't, all of this wasn't approved in the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4408.159s">Is</a>  that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4408.62s">Cause</a>  like, I, I guess I forgot that, you know, that part of it, that it's just a plan, but we're not guaranteed to get those fundings.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4417.727s">Yes</a>  that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4419.047s">So</a>  when we went through the process of identifying a five year capital plan we were identifying and incorporating areas that as the school department we wanted to put on a list that would then be going to city council for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4435.452s">Again</a>  our list was very comprehensive very thorough does not mean that that equates to funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4442.994s">It</a>  does not mean that that is absolute absolute. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4446.735s">It's</a>  a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4448.132s">We</a>  still have to get the funds approved through free cash process and then approved from city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4455.574s">So</a>  although we may have a plan for $2 million in a capital repair, that does not mean that $2 million is going to be issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4465.118s">That's</a>  indicating that we have identified the need for such capital repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4471.3s">Again,</a>  it's a balancing act for the city's funding and what is available through free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4478.662s">Fiscal</a>  year 20, again, even though the fiscal year has started, we have not gotten free cash certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4484.871s">Therefore,</a>  we cannot even request to get any funding for these second year projects until that occurs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4491.214s">And</a>  it's the natural course, it's the natural process that occurs each year that we need to get DOR certification and then the balancing act of which projects are going to be funded from city and school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4504.52s">So</a>  our capital plan was submitted as a plan identifying the needs coming up for the school buildings.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4513.944s">So</a>  Aleesha Nunley is in the process of closing the books for the municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4518.266s">And</a>  once they're closed, they get submitted to DOR. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4521.103s">and</a>  then they certify the free cash from the prior year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4524.384s">So</a>  we're in like a hold pattern right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4526.265s">Hopefully</a>  October we'll get notification of our free cash allotment and that's when we can submit papers to the council from free cash.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4534.049s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4535.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4537.41s">I'm</a>  all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4537.87s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4538.311s">Thank</a>  you, John.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4540.171s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4542.47s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4542.67s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4544.371s">Just</a>  a clarification then. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4546.272s">So</a>  each of the projects that we put in the capital plan from now on will be brought forth one by one?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4555.615s">Probably</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4556.456s">Once</a>  free cash is certified, we'll probably accumulate a few projects and put them forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4561.498s">Like</a>  the playgrounds, we're waiting for the CPC committee to make its motions of approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4567.26s">And</a>  that goes to city council as well.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4569.581s">Do</a>  we have an understanding of when that would be?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4572.397s">Free</a>  cash?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4573.378s">No,</a>  the CPC process.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4575.619s">I</a>  believe, is it October? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4577.721s">They're</a>  waiting for the final applications next week?</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4580.563s">Correct,</a>  and then I believe the allocations will be going forward for the spring funding amount.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4587.037s">So</a>  no possible, we're not moving forward on any of the playgrounds till next spring, even though they were in year two of our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4596.821s">Do</a>  we, you know, I guess part of me thought that we're just going out to bond for money come into this.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4606.185s">To</a>  the extent we're able to get it through CPC, it's less bonding for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4610.407s">So</a>  it's coming out of the pockets of monies that we've already collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4615.672s">It's</a>  an allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4616.593s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4617.093s">When</a>  you look at a whole spreadsheet, it's coming from different pockets.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4619.934s">I</a>  was at the Columbus School for the Welcome to Kindergarten students, and though I've been there many times looking at the playground surface, I was truly taken aback at how bad it had gotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4635.519s">So</a>  I was thinking that we were going to be able to be moving on these much sooner than now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4641.563s">Money</a>  coming up in the spring, and we all know what that means, is the projects aren't really going to happen maybe until next summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4648.808s">And</a>  frankly, I just think it's, I mean, at some point there's a question of what is the safety level of our <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4655.251s">playgrounds.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4656.932s">It's</a>  been a good number of years that they're there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4659.634s">They're</a>  not meant to last forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4661.635s">They</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4663.035s">And</a>  so quite honestly, I'm really disappointed that we're not moving more aggressively on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4667.798s">And</a>  I understand that there's these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4670.224s">But</a>  I guess part of me feels like, well, we ought to have a plan B. We ought to be thinking of a plan B now in case we don't get funded for all of those plan grants.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4679.589s">Of</a>  course there will be a plan B if we don't get the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4681.45s">But</a>  we are not going to jump to plan B before we hear on plan A. And if they move sooner than later, we can get this in the pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4689.413s">And</a>  I believe the Roberts took them about a week to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4693.075s">So</a>  it could be over a school vacation week as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4695.576s">Once</a>  we get approval, we can move.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4699.91s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4700.21s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4700.53s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4700.91s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4703.231s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4703.951s">Um,</a>  thank you for the update on the CPA requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4707.652s">I</a>  was going to ask that, um, John, thank you for you and your team for all the work that you do, not only through the summer, but through the whole year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4714.894s">It's</a>  greatly appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4716.035s">The</a>  clock never stops ticking. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4717.355s">That's</a>  for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4718.255s">So</a>  now that I, now we're coming into winter season, so we got a whole new, uh, battle to rage.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4724.157s">So</a>  now that I have you smiling, can we get all the rugs cleaned in all the classrooms at all the schools and not just the Brook?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4732.098s">Well,</a>  they do the libraries and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4734.039s">I</a>  mean, if we can get a tally on who has them, that's really where it comes down to.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4737.339s">Especially</a>  the kindergarten rugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4739.64s">We've</a>  heard over the years how important that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4742.16s">And</a>  if we're doing it for one school, they probably all need them.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4745.621s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4746.221s">Without</a>  a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4746.841s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4747.021s">So</a>  that's an easy one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4748.922s">We'll</a>  get you saying yes to things.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4751.948s">And</a>  then, as long as you guys okay the funds, we'll do whatever anybody wants.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4756.333s">The</a>  Curtis Tufts, can we get our friends to come in over the holidays and over the breaks to continue the painting that happened?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4764.477s">Oh,</a>  I can certainly, yeah, I can certainly request that through the parks department, Mike Nesta. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4769.68s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4770.921s">And</a>  that would be great if we could finish painting that building and spruce that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4776.204s">So</a>  since we're not doing the stairs there, I'm sure there are a lot of needs in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4781.848s">Can</a>  we allocate those funds that were for the front stairs to something else in that building? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4786.991s">Because</a>  there are a lot of needs there and sometimes that building's forgotten.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4792.274s">That</a>  would be Christine.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4793.84s">I</a>  just want to make sure that building is cared for well.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4798.207s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4798.467s">So</a>  that was the main plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4800.25s">However,</a>  this was part of a free cash item. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4803.775s">The</a>  air handler units had some additional <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4808.112s">Disrepair</a>  that needed to be accommodated so that particular funding has been utilized for the capital improvements that we had in year one So that that would be we would have to look at another funding source in terms of just just beautification of that that space</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4827.485s">Yeah,</a>  in general, though, that school is looking very worn, and it's a face of Medford, and it needs some help. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4835.934s">It</a>  needs some Medford Mustang banners. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4838.777s">It</a>  needs some pizazz. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4840.279s">You</a>  painted the sign out front, and you keep it very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4843.563s">Maybe</a>  some more plantings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4845.565s">It</a>  needs attention as well as the other buildings in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4848.808s">And</a>  actually, that's really at the beginning of MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4852.834s">It's</a>  the face, the welcome of MedFed, and it should stand out that it's part of our public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4858.342s">So</a>  I would really recommend some more love and care given to our Tufts, and I'm always gonna advocate for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4866.028s">You</a>  know, they got the new shades, the floors are getting done, and they look beautiful when they're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4874.983s">I</a>  know you've done them, and I know it's a lot of labor to do that, and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4881.364s">And</a>  I appreciate all the years that the last few years really updates have been happening in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4886.828s">I'd</a>  just like to continue that and make sure that that school.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4890.051s">It</a>  certainly takes time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4891.792s">And</a>  there's, you know, we're taking care of projects that were in the pipeline for a while and we just keep trying to chip away at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4902.06s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4903.072s">I</a>  have two more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4904.393s">The</a>  first is the more moisture issue at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4907.554s">Is</a>  it in an office that's currently occupied? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4910.036s">And</a>  if, uh, is it safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4911.877s">That's,</a>  that's my question.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4913.037s">It's</a>  not occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4914.258s">It</a>  is safe, but it's not occupied.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4916.159s">And</a>  it's, it's not in the area where children are.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4918.941s">No,</a>  it's in the, um, if you're looking at the front of the Columbus school, the bottom right, there's a, there's a hill, there's a little corner office in there and we've been getting a little bit of moisture seeping in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4931.343s">So</a>  we have a company coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4934.467s">They're</a>  going to dig it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4935.608s">We</a>  were in there this summer with Mike Nestor's crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4939.133s">And</a>  we dug a hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4940.655s">And</a>  we took a hose. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4941.556s">And</a>  we sprayed it for like two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4944.139s">And</a>  it didn't come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4946.302s">But</a>  you can see on the other side that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4950.166s">Whenever</a>  it did come through it did so we're not a hundred percent sure how why so we're gonna dig it out We're gonna put a membrane in against the wall as well as a French drain inside there with a sump pump in case anything happens to Just to alleviate that concern that we had with them with the moisture around getting in there.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4970.19s">Okay</a>  in the inside Area will be cleaned up in yeah, we're gonna be taking out parts of walls and replacing them and <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4978.158s">And</a>  it's contained to that one little area. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4980.559s">Exactly,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4981.76s">We</a>  had an air quality test that came out pretty well last week actually.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4985.602s">Yeah,</a>  I just want to make sure it's safe.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4987.202s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4989.063s">And</a>  I'm sure you do too. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4990.484s">And</a>  then my last one is could we get an update on the curbing and all of that that happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4997.542s">Was</a>  that under you, or was that DPW?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5001.465s">Yeah,</a>  the DPW, they were working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5005.208s">I</a>  know that there's still some more granite down there that they have plans for. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5009.972s">It's</a>  just a question that school started. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5011.894s">They</a>  have to dig. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5017.718s">I</a>  assume that some point during a vacation break or something they'll get back to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5023.399s">But</a>  the main parts that we had the very much, we had the concerns for, which was where kids stepping off buses and things of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5034.902s">And</a>  parent parking area, I mean parent drop off areas has all been replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5040.723s">And</a>  they also did sidewalk panels down there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5044.382s">And</a>  they did a little bit of asphalt where they put the 3D crosswalk in today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5050.964s">And</a>  by the way, we're going to have that painted as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5053.645s">The</a>  other crosswalks that we were concerned about, they're going to be painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5057.286s">I</a>  think he was going to do them tonight, Steve, and the DPW crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5060.987s">We're</a>  supposed to do them tonight, but we'll see. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5063.728s">We'll</a>  see how it worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5066.149s">But</a>  yeah, they're supposed to paint up the crosswalks.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5069.154s">So</a>  when we last left our meeting, I thought we were getting that machine in that does the cement.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5074.398s">The</a>  machine would not work because the road was not level. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5078.562s">So</a>  if you have a brand new road that's perfectly level, the machine is beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5082.405s">But</a>  when you have a road that's not, it doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5085.787s">I</a>  just want to say thank you.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5086.788s">I</a>  think it works better with asphalt, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5089.31s">Because</a>  I asked them if they could give us an asphalt berm. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5093.391s">at</a>  the Brooks in between the play area and the pathway, because sometimes the rain rushes down and then it gets on the new field. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5102.577s">So</a>  they were going to do that when they get a chance.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5104.739s">I</a>  mean, we all know how busy they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5107.66s">So</a>  did all schools get the granite curbing that needed them?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5113.145s">The</a>  only schools right now we've been working on is the McGlynn and Andrews Complex because that was the one that was needed to be done the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5122.453s">Not</a>  saying that Columbus may have a few areas, any of the other buildings that have cement curbing.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5130.019s">First</a>  of all, however it happened, I'm sure it was much more expensive, but it was a great need for the school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5138.806s">I</a>  appreciate it being done, as well as many teachers.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5142.248s">Well,</a>  we'll never have to revisit it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5144.669s">Once</a>  now, it would be, maybe not anybody here, but another 20 years from now, somebody else would have to revisit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5152.573s">We</a>  will not have to.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5154.534s">Probably</a>  not even then.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5155.695s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5156.824s">And</a>  I'm just glad that that was done in a way that it's going to be done for many years and not have to just keep revisiting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5164.208s">I'm</a>  sure that was a greater expense, and I'm not sure where those funds came from, but I'm glad you found them.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5170.051s">Well,</a>  they got a good deal on it.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5171.772s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5172.713s">And</a>  I know a lot of work went into it over the summer, and it's appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5176.995s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5178.276s">Thank</a>  you again.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5179.728s">Well,</a>  like I said, it takes a lot of people, not just myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5182.991s">It's</a>  a lot of cooperation with everybody to take on this.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5186.714s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5187.795s">Thank</a>  you so much, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5188.616s">Thank</a>  you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5190.317s">I</a>  had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5191.098s">So</a>  I think maybe a number of months ago, the committee voted to have an inventory of all the expensive equipment as like a spreadsheet or some sort of initiative to understand where things are.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5203.448s">Well,</a>  I sent you something. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5204.989s">I</a>  sent you a sort of a kind of a <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5208.823s">I</a>  don't know what you want to call it, but kind of like at the start of a playbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5212.768s">And</a>  I thought I was actually waiting for you to take a look at it to see if you wanted.</p>

    <p>[Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5218.014s">I'll</a>  get back to you on that, personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5219.376s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5219.716s">If</a>  that's the way you prefer to do it, that's OK.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5221.639s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5223.361s">All</a>  right, Mr. Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5226.174s">You</a>  ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5226.714s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5227.255s">If</a>  I had any idea what I was going to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5230.756s">My</a>  question was actually around the playground at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5234.178s">Other</a>  than the resurfacing, which I understand is in the CPA pipeline, much of the playground equipment itself is not there anymore because it wasn't safe anymore and it's been removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5247.044s">Do</a>  we even have actually putting a playground back in the Columbus in the plan?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5253.247s">I</a>  don't believe so.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5255.483s">When</a>  I spoke, I went around to all the playgrounds, obviously, when we were preparing for the plan that we were going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5264.25s">I</a>  spoke to Travis Arms, he's the representative, and I did tell him that we would be repairing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5273.638s">However,</a>  whether it's operational money, there wouldn't be any sense to put a new surface in there without <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5283.761s">upgrading</a>  the equipment that's in there, obviously, because this lifespan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5288.484s">So</a>  it's almost like at the Andrews, where we went down and we got the money for the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5293.947s">It's</a>  like, you're going to put a solar panel on a roof that only has five years left? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5298.349s">You</a>  want to keep everything running concurrently together. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5301.791s">I</a>  talked with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5305.453s">We</a>  were going through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5306.433s">I</a>  said, we want this replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5307.694s">We</a>  want this replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5308.454s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5310.815s">It</a>  wouldn't be worth our time to spend $90,000, $100,000 and then have broken equipment on it.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5317.698s">Is</a>  he working on an estimate for you?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5319.739s">He</a>  was, yes.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5320.879s">But</a>  I'm just concerned about all the equipment that's actually been removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5323.927s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5324.627s">It's</a>  not there, it's not broken.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5326.188s">It's</a>  like it's just cut off in the MIA. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5328.589s">We</a>  can come up with a plan, whether we add something new, whether we replace what was there, however people would want to attempt it.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5338.073s">Because</a>  new families showing up to the Columbus would be unaware of a number of pieces of equipment that used to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5343.916s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5344.236s">Perhaps</a>  in the, if I put the building and grounds committee, that could be a topic that you discuss.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5349.258s">And</a>  what you've got to understand, too, is something that was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5353.435s">available</a>  there, like they had those little mushrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5356.676s">That's</a>  not necessarily something that you would put in a playground of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5360.258s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5363.359s">I</a>  don't want the 2001 playground reconstituted. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5366.54s">So</a>  you might replace it with something else that was appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5369.901s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5372.761s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5378.226s">I</a>  just want to follow up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5379.447s">Thank</a>  you for all your work, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5380.768s">One</a>  of the things that I noted in particular with the compressors, that was a big ticket item and I see a lot of them got done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5386.653s">So</a>  that is just great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5388.194s">The</a>  other thing which I noticed on this list is how much of this, you know, it's stuff that people can't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5396.283s">It</a>  needs to be done, but it's not visible stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5398.644s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5399.284s">It's</a>  not paint and wax. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5400.425s">And</a>  that's just, I'm making a point because it's important to realize that this is thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars, all of which needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5407.768s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5408.088s">But</a>  you can't really even see. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5409.469s">So</a>  it's the infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5410.689s">So</a>  thanks again.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5411.93s">Well,</a>  they know when it's not working.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5417.212s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5417.432s">Kreatz,</a>  did you have a final comment on this?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5419.653s">It</a>  was about the crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5420.713s">I</a>  did talk to Steve Tenaglia today at the crosswalk, and he said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5424.948s">He</a>  was going to do the other crosswalks as soon as they could, if not, like maybe tonight or tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5432.13s">It</a>  depends on how many cars are in the parking lot.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5434.351s">We</a>  just want to get in between the after school program and the drop off so that obviously people don't drive over a wet, painted crosswalk.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5444.513s">And</a>  he also, there's two crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5448.148s">not</a>  crosswalks, I'm sorry, stop signs that are in their parking lot that are all faded out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5452.412s">He</a>  said he has two and he can swap them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5454.634s">Perfect.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5455.935s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5457.356s">On</a>  the motion, is there a motion to receive and place this report on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5461.5s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero, is there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5463.101s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5465.123s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5466.164s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5467.465s">Report</a>  on attendance, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5468.966s">Caldwell.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5474.165s">So</a>  I've attached for you the current attendance numbers, effective September 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5479.368s">It's</a>  still early in the school year, and the Parent Information Center continues to register students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5484.771s">We</a>  have 115 pre-kindergarten students, which is up 29 from last year, 288 new kindergartners, and 14 not medically cleared yet, and this was like as of last week, so I'm sure we have more, and approximately 80 new EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5502.087s">Our</a>  class size remains excellent and our middle schools are balanced in the sixth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5508.871s">So</a>  the first page shows you the overall district counts from Meep at the high school all the way through all the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5519.939s">The</a>  second page is the Andrews, McGlynn, Medford High vocational and the Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5527.175s">The</a>  third page is the elementary school page with the total number of students in each class and the average class size with the number of teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5538.359s">And</a>  the very last page is a comparison page from September 5th of last year.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5550.863s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5551.343s">Caldwell.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5557.298s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5557.438s">Conwell,</a>  do we have any students who are here for medical treatment who might be adversely affected by the federal government's move not to continue their immigration status? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5576.087s">Not</a>  to my knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5577.528s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5578.188s">If</a>  there are, would you let us know only so we can advocate for them? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5581.529s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5582.089s">We</a>  don't ask immigration on applications for new students.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5585.991s">But</a>  you never let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5586.811s">But</a>  if they had come to you, it was just a great concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5590.633s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5590.953s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5591.873s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5592.294s">VanCleef.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5593.514s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5595.515s">Is</a>  it possible, I realize that on a day-to-day basis it is not possible, but is it possible once we do our DESE submission on October 1st that <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5606.435s">Can</a>  we get breakdowns of charter school enrollment by grade to add to this?</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5613.087s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5613.667s">I</a>  can check on that for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5614.548s">That</a>  would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5615.308s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5615.969s">You</a>  know, when I look at a number of different sites that try to talk about the student population, I know ClearGov includes literally every child of educated age broken out by where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5629.618s">And</a>  I know that I have a chart that shows our population of students has remained virtually flat since 1995. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5638.964s">But</a>  that doesn't mean the number of students in our public schools has. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5642.486s">And</a>  I think that'd be helpful, because when I look at the grade 10 from last year, that was 302, and now they're in 11th grade, most of them, and there's a 15 student drop, which on the surface isn't a big number, but if you look at the other grades, we're going up or down five students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5664.584s">So</a>  I'm just curious, are we losing, are all these ninth graders <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5669.963s">that</a>  are 10 or 15 of them, are they bailing for charter schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5674.612s">I</a>  mean, 10 or 15 students is a boatload of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5678.36s">Some</a>  went up, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5680.544s">Yeah,</a>  they went up by five. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5682.812s">Which</a>  I mean, it's hard to know like, you know people just moving in or what I knew or right Yeah, but that would be helpful sure you may not have access but if you do it I can look into that for you sure miss Patterson has been doing quite a bit of work on our charter school population.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5701.158s">Yes,</a>  just a Follow-up the charter enrollment is not provided until June of a subsequent year from desi so we are in the process of <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5711.964s">going</a>  through, we've already identified students that might not have been Medford residents, so we are trying to win back some of our students that were listed under a charter breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5723.89s">So</a>  where that's, they've applied to different charter schools, have their application in process, does not necessarily mean that they've actually landed there and or that they could be being incorrectly charged to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5739.078s">So</a>  we are in the process of <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5741.182s">going</a>  through to our charters to advocate on behalf of our students to return them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5746.804s">So</a>  in terms of an actual annualized up-to-date listing, DESE does not provide that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5754.527s">It</a>  doesn't happen until the fourth quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5757.848s">Does</a>  it give it by grade, though? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5760.249s">They</a>  have it by year of graduation, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5762.33s">Year</a>  of graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5764.091s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5764.211s">So</a>  we could work it out, but we would just be picking an old June date. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5767.492s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5768.372s">At</a>  least wouldn't it let us know what we're talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5770.733s">Is</a>  everybody in kindergarten going to charter schools, or is it where in this?</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5776.277s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5777.218s">Actually,</a>  our kindergarten numbers this year have increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5781.841s">We</a>  have 14 to 18 medically unclear children. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5785.664s">So</a>  once those kiddos get in, you'll see a little bit of a bump up in kindergarten this year.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5791.448s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5792.168s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5793.569s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5793.829s">Kreatz?</a> </p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5794.47s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5795.17s">I</a>  just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5796.772s">I</a>  know I've heard that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5799.134s">there</a>  is an increased class size in the vocational numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5802.975s">And</a>  it's hard to tell because we're only seeing the total number here, the 322, which is the combined number. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5811.577s">So</a>  I'm wondering, I mean, if we could just get a breakdown of, you know, the number of students enrolled in the program, maybe at, you know, just an updated report.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5821.509s">Do</a>  you have something? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5823.21s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5823.611s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5825.112s">Diane,</a>  I have one.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5826.313s">Hold</a>  on Mia, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5829.875s">Point</a>  of information miss must own.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5831.876s">Yes,</a>  I just spoke with Mr. Delay because someone else had asked about a breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5836.74s">So</a>  when the sophomore class currently at the high school is 150 enrolled in CTE and 170 in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5844.926s">And</a>  that was the only class that someone had asked me about. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5851.29s">Oh,</a>  sorry, I do have that 207 in ninth grade in CTE and 122 in high school.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5860.337s">Wow,</a>  207 in CTE. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5861.938s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5862.179s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5862.459s">Mastone,</a>  I love standing here and have other people answer the questions.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5867.863s">So</a>  I was just curious because I heard about the increase.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5869.785s">Thank</a>  you for that point of information.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5872.146s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5872.607s">Kreatz.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5873.588s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5874.028s">You're</a>  all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5874.829s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5877.465s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5878.525s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5879.325s">If</a>  we're requesting the data on charter schools, we should also include private and parochial schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5887.087s">Because</a>  if the drop off is between ninth and 10th grade, it could be an MCAS issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5892.089s">And</a>  we want to make sure that it's still our children if we're educating them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5901.211s">Whether</a>  or not it's our dollars, it's still our.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5904.152s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. Russo.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5906.655s">I'm</a>  just not sure what an MCAS issue means.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5909.256s">Oh,</a>  well, kids that don't want to take MCAS when they go to parochial private schools, they're not held to that standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5918.539s">So</a>  I want to know if students are leaving Method High for that reason as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5924.04s">It's</a>  just as important that we make sure we're educating them and feeling confident so that they don't feel like they have to leave for those reasons as well.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5931.943s">Is</a>  there a reporting that's done to the school system of Catholic and</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5935.737s">So</a>  you're talking about Matanon and Arlington Catholic, like high schools?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5940.0s">No,</a>  no, like MC, Malden Catholics, things like that.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5945.223s">All</a>  of them?</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5945.824s">Any</a>  of them.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5947.145s">If</a>  we have reasons while people withdraw, if you get the reasoning, if they're going to, like you, when people withdraw, you have to report to the Department of Education the reason whether they're forwarding to a <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5960.052s">another</a>  public school district, if they're going to a charter school, if they're going to private, or any way of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5968.499s">And</a>  just for our own information, because if ninth graders are feeling like they're not comfortable passing that, and parents are moving them, we want to know that.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5976.786s">We</a>  do get that information, actually, because schools will ask us for records, so we know where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5982.711s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ricciardelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5983.512s">So</a>  I just wanted to add that each year, we need to file a school's attending report with the Department of Ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5988.963s">So</a>  that comes out of my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5991.524s">So</a>  that is submitted every February. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5993.304s">So</a>  I do have the numbers from 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5995.845s">So</a>  we can take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5998.705s">And</a>  then we also can get some other numbers from School Brains and what we have in district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6005.007s">But</a>  that is something that we're required to report, all of the private school placements.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6029.472s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6030.273s">So</a>  we are happy to report that we have rolled out our new recruiting and hiring platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6037.078s">This</a>  completely automates our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6040.66s">So</a>  where we are able to post on different job boards, we direct them to our Medford website and they apply to our jobs completely electronically. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6052.669s">So</a>  we have all the demographic information in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6055.551s">We</a>  are able to compile <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6057.415s">job</a>  position pools for various positions that we know are ongoing, such as lifeguards, daily subs, paraprofessionals are a very active group as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6069.864s">So</a>  we have, we started this at the end of May of 2019, so this was a very busy summer season with rolling out the new system and providing all of the job postings and getting the new hires in through the automated process. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6087.143s">I</a>  don't have an accurate count just as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6089.765s">We</a>  are still having active resignations, changes, things of that sort as late as today. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6097.55s">So</a>  I didn't want to provide information that was inaccurate or not up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6102.734s">I</a>  will have that available once things have settled out and we have a full, fully staffed department. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6111.5s">buildings,</a>  building-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6113.401s">But</a>  we are excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6115.241s">The</a>  platform provides both external and internal postings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6120.304s">So</a>  once we are truly 100% committed, we'll be able to post all of the stipend coaching positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6128.348s">We've</a>  outfitted all of those for this school year, 19-20. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6133.091s">And</a>  going forward, we will have those positions posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6138.815s">The</a>  winter, fall sports that have not had coaches, we will be posting those positions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6146.041s">And</a>  that way everything is, again, we are onboarding our staff from the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6153.267s">It</a>  streamlines it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6154.428s">It</a>  reduces human error in terms of reading employee application information. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6160.505s">It</a>  has reduced the application process and streamlined it completely automated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6165.147s">So</a>  where we used to provide a very large packet of hand copy paper, it's now fully electronic and streamlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6176.092s">So</a>  we are very excited as well as being able to provide the demographics of our pool of candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6183.735s">And</a>  I did provide a sample of the equal employment opportunity report. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6189.057s">So</a>  that just shows you <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6190.837s">the</a>  volume of where we have had just in a short amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6196.919s">And</a>  it also provides the demographics based on what people have self-reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6202.84s">We</a>  don't ask that up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6205.041s">It's</a>  voluntary in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6207.542s">But</a>  it gives us a better idea of our application pool and the applicants that are coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6213.683s">We</a>  are very committed to <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6217.036s">diversity</a>  and hiring diverse staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6220.899s">And</a>  so this is a tool that will be able to have better reporting capabilities and really streamline this process and make it much more efficient for all of Medford public schools.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6232.289s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6233.57s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6234.73s">This</a>  is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6235.471s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6236.922s">Well,</a>  this system, I believe it was in the spring I had a communication with you about reports that I get on the Shore Educational Collaborative, where I'm the Medford representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6250.682s">We</a>  get a report each time we meet that has a list of people who are out on leave, why they're out on leave, as much as we're allowed to know, terminations, retirements, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6262.946s">And</a>  I just assumed that was a report that we got there because they decided to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6269.467s">And</a>  then when I asked the representatives from the other six or seven or eight school committees that were there, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6275.733s">literally</a>  everyone said, no, we all get this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6278.916s">You're</a>  supposed to get this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6280.697s">So</a>  will that system, this new system, actually be able to generate that report? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6284.721s">Because</a>  I know when we talked, doing it by hand was not going to be it.</p>

    <p>[Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6290.406s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6290.726s">So</a>  this system would not be able to identify terminations, resignations, and or leave of absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6297.812s">That</a>  is still a separate manual reporting component because <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6303.835s">In</a>  the system, we're posting for new hires. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6308.059s">So</a>  even though in a notation, we can make a note internally that this posting is due to a resignation, x, y, z, or due to a long-term coverage situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6321.001s">but</a>  that's not a reportable field in this particular system. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6325.304s">So</a>  in terms of that listing, yes, we will be able to provide that for the upcoming year, but it is a manual report, not system generated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6335.171s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6337.553s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6338.954s">Is</a>  there a motion to receive and place this report on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6342.556s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6344.357s">Kreatz,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6345.318s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6345.598s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6346.299s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6347.079s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6348.32s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6350.582s">And</a>  report on summer programs, Dr. Peter Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6353.903s">Welcome,</a>  Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6355.943s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6356.583s">I</a>  appreciate the opportunity to speak with everybody tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6359.504s">And</a>  so I just want to talk about the various summer programs we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6364.025s">The</a>  Medford Summer Fund Program, the report was submitted by Anthony Petropoulos, the program director. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6370.266s">Entered</a>  its 13th year for about eight weeks over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6375.147s">saw</a>  between 100 and 120 campers participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6379.668s">During</a>  the summer, we obviously had a lot of heat issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6382.529s">Myself,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6383.989s">Caldwell,</a>  Dr. Edouard-Vincent, we all took opportunities to not only go up to the fields for summer fun, but to visit the schools to check on various rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6393.091s">We</a>  had a number of people bring in their own air conditioners for a few of those hot days when they were working on the air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6398.632s">Really</a>  a team effort to really make sure that our kids were safe throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6403.833s">Back</a>  to summer fun, there were 28 full and part-time employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6407.935s">A</a>  lot of great activities I saw the kids involved with. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6411.137s">Two</a>  special guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6412.797s">First</a>  was District Attorney Marion Ryan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6415.219s">She</a>  brought her Jeopardy game on making sure the kids were safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6419.0s">And</a>  Mayor Burke brought our kids a lot of ice cream slash freeze pops, I should say, freeze pops. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6428.045s">The</a>  camp made effective use of the Facebook page to publicize the Tufts University research group's case study on healthy and unhealthy eating habits. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6439.173s">So</a>  that was something that was really good that was done with parent permission, parent-guardian permission. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6444.476s">David</a>  Blouk supported the report to me on the summer school participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6449.518s">114</a>  students through grades 6 through 12 participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6453.799s">Courses</a>  ran from 8 in the morning till noon with two sections of two-hour blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6459.301s">The</a>  online system software Play-Doh was utilized by a number of students to help them make their effective academic progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6469.424s">14,</a>  I'm sorry, there was a typo. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6472.386s">If</a>  you notice down the bottom, graduation is 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6475.167s">Students</a>  reach graduation status by completing summer courses, going on to the third page there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6481.23s">Eight</a>  students received their diplomas and four their certificate attainment. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6486.192s">We</a>  had a great celebration on August 21st that many of you were able to attend to really celebrate those students, celebrate them not only with their diplomas but also with cake. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6500.2s">We</a>  didn't bring any of the leftover hamburgers from the event earlier in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6503.622s">The</a>  sixth grade barbecue, sixth grade barbecue was another phenomenal event. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6509.526s">For</a>  those of you that were there, I've done a comprehensive research analysis <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6513.912s">and</a>  have determined that the hockey pucks that were developed were either operator error or a flaw in the equipment that we used. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6522.335s">Somewhere</a>  in between, I'm leaning toward flaw in the equipment as I was the operator. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6530.138s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6532.059s">So</a>  you have the breakdown prepared by our assistant principal, David Blug, the program director for summer school on those students and the courses that they took. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6544.972s">And</a>  then the extended year program prepared by Lisa Iannelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6550.396s">136</a>  students were slated to receive services this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6553.078s">19</a>  students, for whatever reason, chose not to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6558.322s">But</a>  the programs that we saw were very well maintained and provided opportunities to really maintain their academic achievement without losing that over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6570.792s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6573.193s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6574.354s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6575.254s">I</a>  had some questions and I'm not sure you'll have the answers to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6579.056s">It</a>  was about the summer fun camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6581.538s">Last</a>  year we worked hand in hand at the special education subcommittee to make sure that the staff was trained to and had paperwork ready for all students with any needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6596.7s">So</a>  that they would be met and I was also curious about having did the price increase in the summer fun camp affect enrollment in any way and if we provided it more families with Vouchers or scholarships to help them through that So maybe you could just get back to us on that.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6617.334s">I'm</a>  sure that you might not have those answers I'd be happy to get those because I definitely don't have those answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6622.338s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6622.998s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6643.207s">You</a>  are. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6644.488s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6644.668s">Lazzaro.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6648.51s">So</a>  what we're going to present to you shortly <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6652.487s">is</a>  the results of the outcome of the middle school lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6659.373s">And</a>  we're going to show you the data from the fall, or not from the fall, the data from the late spring when we initially presented the information, and then where we ended up at the end of the school year, taking into account students that were added. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6677.947s">So</a>  these are our most recent numbers that are gonna be shared with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6683.083s">So</a>  this presentation is titled, once again, Correcting the Imbalance. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6688.748s">This</a>  was the state of the two middle schools prior to the middle school lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6694.573s">So</a>  here is the McGlynn Middle School, the racial breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6699.677s">This</a>  is the original data prior to the lottery, followed by the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6711.314s">And</a>  this is the McGlynn socioeconomic status breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6718.537s">And</a>  blue represents families that are paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6723.499s">And</a>  the following slide is the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6733.244s">And</a>  so what did we do to solve this disparity? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6736.545s">We</a>  conducted <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6741.043s">the</a>  lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6744.346s">And</a>  as you can see here, students and families would no longer choose which middle school to attend, but would be randomly assigned to a middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6755.314s">Students</a>  who were English learners and or students with specific special education needs, they would be automatically assigned to the corresponding middle school that offered their program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6769.965s">And</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6770.928s">the</a>  purpose of the lottery, a lot of people wanted to find out, did it work? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6778.954s">The</a>  answer is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6783.016s">Although</a>  it's not a perfect system, it helped to create greater balance between the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6791.422s">So</a>  once again, I show you the original data. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6794.464s">This</a>  is the racial breakdown of the McGlynn, followed by the Andrews, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6802.114s">And</a>  for school year 2019-20, this is the new breakdown of the McGlynn School and the new breakdown of the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6825.95s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, I was going to ask you to go back one more time just for a quick second. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6831.513s">And</a>  Andrews, okay, you can move forward, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6836.694s">So</a>  what you can see is that the incoming sixth grade classes, they're not 100% equal, but they are much closer to equity, to an equitable balance between the two schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6863.37s">And</a>  so by having the lottery, it's going to allow us to have a student body that will more closely reflect balanced demographics between both schools in the coming years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6884.828s">Again,</a>  looking at the SES, our socioeconomic status, the next slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6893.183s">This</a>  is the original McGlynn's socioeconomic status. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6901.731s">And</a>  this is the original Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6905.234s">The</a>  next slide will show you the 2019 data for the McGlynn Middle School as it stands right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6914.962s">And</a>  the following slide is the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6928.484s">just</a>  give you a moment to reflect. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6937.489s">So</a>  as you can see, um, it is definitely a much more even distribution at the sixth grade between both schools as opposed to the previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6952.357s">And</a>  I want to say that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6958.241s">I</a>  want to thank you all, Mayor Burke, and you, the esteemed members of the school committee, because I know that this was a courageous decision initially to look at data and think about how could we bring about greater balance, correcting the imbalance that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6978.146s">And</a>  so a lot of people, including parents in the community, were wondering how this was going to play out <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6984.799s">And</a>  would it actually make a difference? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6987.48s">And</a>  by doing the random lottery, it did make, at least at the sixth grade level, it was random, but it made a noticeable significant difference in terms of bringing about greater balance between the two sixth grade classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7004.728s">And</a>  so I just want to thank you all for your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7009.483s">and</a>  to see that this is the outcome of what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7012.224s">And</a>  so I truly am grateful to you all and to the community the parents the students who kind of went on this journey with us trusted us and to be able to show the data that the data did move and that we made a difference for this sixth grade incoming class. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7032.273s">And</a>  we truly are committed to continuing to create opportunities for both schools <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7038.633s">to</a>  work collaboratively together, because I truly believe that we are one Medford, one district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7045.037s">And</a>  so this was our report. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7048.378s">And</a>  once again, our final slide, I will say, go Mustangs, because we are one Mustang community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7055.762s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7056.943s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Maurice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7060.305s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7060.865s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7061.145s">Kritz.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7065.419s">you</a>  know, a nice story. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7066.48s">And</a>  I think we all got an email message from a former MedBit resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7072.083s">And</a>  so I ended up calling her because I wanted to, you know, try to just talk to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7077.366s">So</a>  she had some questions about the original <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7082.849s">numbers</a>  that were at both middle schools and she was concerned, you know, what are we doing about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7087.834s">And</a>  I said, wow, the timing of this email is just bizarre because we just got an update in our packet this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7094.841s">So</a>  I shared the results with her and she was just completely impressed and <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7099.706s">She</a>  asked for me to mail a copy to her where she lives in New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7103.61s">So</a>  I'm going to do that and mail her a copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7105.772s">And</a>  it was just really noticeable. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7107.875s">It</a>  was really dramatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7108.956s">And</a>  I didn't think it would really move that quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7111.418s">I</a>  really didn't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7112.259s">And</a>  it was just incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7114.482s">And</a>  then I just had one other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7117.525s">A</a>  parent had asked me, so her student was in the <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7122.04s">Her</a>  student was or wasn't in the lottery, I'm not really sure, but her student is in the language-based program, but I guess that group of students wasn't put into the lottery, and she was just wondering why they weren't put into the lottery, where there is a language-based program at both schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7140.658s">If</a>  you would maybe know the answer to that.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7143.42s">The</a>  students that are assigned the students with special needs and or else based on what is spelled out within the respective individualized education plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7158.404s">Students</a>  are assigned based on that information, so although you could have. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7168.237s">the</a>  same title of the programming, it's not the same exact, it's not identical. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7176.259s">And</a>  so it is something that the special education team definitely looks carefully at and looks at what <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7186.218s">offering</a>  each school has. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7189.48s">So</a>  we're not able to have identical programming of everything in each building, because it would be a lot of significant human capital implications for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7202.226s">But</a>  with the way the programs are divvied up right now, we are able to have teachers that are highly qualified meeting the needs of those respective students.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7215.483s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7216.644s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7219.406s">Name</a>  and address for the record from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7222.108s">Can</a>  we get that light shut off, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7225.45s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7225.911s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7231.487s">281</a>  Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7232.748s">My</a>  family experienced the lottery this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7236.289s">We're</a>  parents that were from the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7240.571s">We</a>  found that the lottery was not evenly split for the Roberts Elementary School because we do have the Yale Welcome Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7247.933s">Although</a>  they are members of our community, they are not members who actually had integrated with our students during their time at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7255.176s">So</a>  when they split our students in half, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7258.258s">What</a>  happened was 53 students went to the Andrews, and some were in the neighborhood of the low 20s of the students that they had been in class with daily for six years went to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7268.822s">The</a>  students that went to the McGlynn found themselves to be fairly socially isolated because the majority of their friends did go to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7276.806s">Anyone</a>  who was present for the lottery when they pulled the Roberts' names saw several circles of friends, boys, girls, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7285.009s">all</a>  the students in the circle would cheer except for one, the one student who chose the McGlynn and found that they were being separated from all of their children, all of their friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7295.514s">So</a>  I'm hoping that when we think about the lottery this year, that we think about while it's great that some of the equity has changed, and I'm not saying that's bad, perhaps we could have offset each of the elementary schools by five children. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7311.357s">And</a>  instead of having the offset at the Roberts be close to 30 children, in that case, my daughter would have had 15 more friends at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7321.705s">Those</a>  students that are also in the low 20s are also split between two sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7326.608s">She</a>  had about two friends that she socialized with that were going to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7330.611s">And</a>  one week before school started, one of the friends called her excitedly and said, yes, I got transferred to the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7339.418s">She</a>  quickly went down to one friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7341.607s">Her</a>  first week was really isolated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7345.229s">There's</a>  not a lot of opportunities to talk to children, and at lunch and recess, as she walked around the track, she said, a lot of the children are with the friends that they've had for years, which I had hoped for my child as I enrolled her in Medford Public Schools at the age of three, so that she would have long-lasting friendships. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7363.787s">So</a>  I hope that socio-emotional will factor in this year in the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7369.013s">I</a>  know this was a unique situation for the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7372.697s">And</a>  I think that it's vitally important to look at for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7377.763s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7378.383s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7378.904s">Thank</a>  you for the feedback.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7384.742s">I'm</a>  Melanie McLaughlin and I live at 152 Austin Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7390.147s">I</a>  want to thank you all for looking at the equity and balance across the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7396.173s">I'm</a>  also the co-chair of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council and have been for the past six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7401.658s">One</a>  of the things that we're concerned about is equity across the district for every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7406.62s">And</a>  so it's about, we understand that there's some programmatic elements regarding EL and special education, but I think those visuals were very helpful and supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7415.964s">I'm</a>  a visual learner. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7416.784s">I</a>  thought those were really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7418.305s">I</a>  would love to see those visuals for special education in English language and what that looks like at the middle schools and to be able to see if there's a disparity there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7427.408s">Is</a>  one middle school getting more of those students and another not? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7430.85s">And</a>  what that actually looks like for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7432.572s">Because</a>  I think as I said from the podium last year, as we're thinking about equity, we have to think about it for all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7440.216s">And</a>  I think that the socioeconomic piece here is really compelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7443.819s">But</a>  again, there's a big piece that we feel is missing, which is the special education and English learner. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7450.543s">population</a>  piece as well, and I know that there have been a lot of families that have been frustrated and have given me feedback about that, either being automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7459.355s">I</a>  know that you're saying, part of the problem is that the IEP does drive the process and the team decisions, but a lot of times the <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7466.103s">families</a>  don't know what the expectations are, the programming might be or why the McGlynn is different than the Andrews or what the programmatic elements are. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7473.61s">And</a>  so I think it's also worth doing a comparison when we're saying everybody sort of dismisses what we can't have similar programs at these schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7481.356s">And</a>  I think that I would like to say, let's think out of the box a little bit more around that and say, well, what would that look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7486.981s">What</a>  does that actually mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7487.942s">How</a>  does that really break down into numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7489.544s">And</a>  since the schools are only a few hundred feet away from each other, is that actually <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7493.803s">realistic,</a>  can we not have people transporting, you know, between the schools, whether it's, you know, staff on different days or what, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7501.327s">But</a>  I think thinking outside of the box for our EL students and our special education students as well so that they feel like they're having equity across the district is really important because we're not feeling that right now and I think that we need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7513.713s">So,</a>  but I appreciate the courageous conversations that we're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7516.675s">I</a>  think this is really important around equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7519.236s">I</a>  also really appreciate that it's been done at the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7522.538s">I</a>  know and I hope that we'll be looking in the future at the elementary school levels as well, because I think that these visuals and these demographics are really important to create the conversation that you're starting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7532.684s">So</a>  we appreciate that you're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7535.186s">Do</a>  you think we might have a visual for the special education EL?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7539.548s">So</a>  the one piece would be that, for example, the McGlynn houses the EL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7547.279s">So</a>  because the EL teachers are based at the McGlynn, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7554.495s">Of</a>  course, we would not see the same numbers reflected at the Andrews, whereas the Andrews does house one of our specialized special education programs, the TLP program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7565.079s">That</a>  program does not exist at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7567.94s">So</a>  the students, so you could have a higher number of students with disabilities <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7572.885s">at</a>  one school because they're housing a specific program, but that was what we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7579.374s">We</a>  know that it's not exactly 50-50. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7583.86s">So</a>  I don't have the numbers just right now, how many students are in this specialized program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7590.709s">but</a>  that is something that I could definitely get.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7593.19s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7594.471s">I</a>  think the visual would be really helpful, and then just also understanding the programmatic elements at the school so that people can understand what this actually breaks down to and not have this ambiguity around, you know, all the EL students are going here, some of the kids with disabilities are there, some are there, and it's not making people want to be at one school or another, you know, because then it creates another level of inequity and conversation.</p>
