[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

9
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:46,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

10
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:47,859

11
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,300

00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:58,306
[SPEAKER_03]: April 8th, 2019 and April 1st, 2019, previously tabled.

14
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:01,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval of the minutes.

15
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

16
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:02,809
[SPEAKER_03]: DiBenedetto.

17
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:03,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

18
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a couple questions on

19
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:17,392
[SPEAKER_05]: the set that says vouchers paid March 30th through April 5th on page three of seven.

20
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:33,737
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a $600 conference, but we couldn't read what it was, National Association for Educational of, do you have any idea what that conference was for and who attended?

21
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:45,829
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there is on bottom of page four of seven, the very last item.

22
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:54,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It says unemployment.

23
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have people currently on the unemployment?

24
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:58,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

25
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:01,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently there's always usually some overlap.

26
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:03,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's an ongoing question.

27
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:05,499
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

28
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

29
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion for approval?

30
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:10,461
[SPEAKER_03]: All there already is.

31
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

32
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:12,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanden Heuvel.

33
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote, please.

34
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:15,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

35
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

36
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:24,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

37
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:25,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Report of secretary.

38
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:25,874
[SPEAKER_03]: None?

39
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:28,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Report of committee.

40
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:31,017
[SPEAKER_03]: There was two committee of the whole meetings, actually.

41
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:36,360
[SPEAKER_03]: March 6th and March 18th and April 3rd, speaking about capital projects.

42
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,962
[SPEAKER_03]: We did vote for the items on the capital list.

43
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:44,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost all were unanimous, with the exclusion of one, which is the roof at the Andrews School.

44
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:50,050
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a six to one vote with Mr. Ruggiero voting against.

45
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,632
[SPEAKER_03]: At this time, we do have a summary that was approved.

46
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe Christine had sent it all to us.

47
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:55,514
[SPEAKER_03]: We're running with that.

48
00:11:56,295 --> 00:12:02,279
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody wishes to vote for the entire package in its totality, we certainly could do that tonight if there's a change of heart.

49
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, we'll go with what was voted on during the committee reports.

50
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:06,743
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good?

51
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:07,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayberg.

52
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:07,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

53
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:08,764
[SPEAKER_05]: DiBenedetto.

54
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:14,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a note about the notes at that thank

55
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't reflect a lot of concerns or ideas that were brought up.

56
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:22,955
[SPEAKER_05]: It just gives bullet points, I think, a little bit more information.

57
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:35,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I know at that meeting, we would have put more items on the capital improvement plan, but we were hoping to get a grant for the whole high school, and that's why those items weren't on there.

58
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:40,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And concerns raised whether a big

59
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:49,564
[SPEAKER_05]: grant would be funded by the city council was also raised because it would cost the city money to match grant funds.

60
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:58,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So all that type of information, I always look back at these notes, so if they could be included a little bit more, I'd appreciate it.

61
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:04,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, generally, in the past, I don't recall the minutes being as detailed as they are right now.

62
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:06,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're very extremely detailed.

63
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:07,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

64
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:08,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Lozaro, for that.

65
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:10,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will take that to note.

66
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:11,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

67
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:12,455
OK.

68
00:13:12,836 --> 00:13:13,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

69
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:13,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Vandekloot.

70
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:15,796
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a couple of different talks.

71
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:21,678
[SPEAKER_15]: The one I mentioned, we did receive, or we're going to receive, a little while before about

72
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:30,229
[SPEAKER_15]: that should be included in this capital plan because it was a piece of information we didn't know.

73
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:39,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we can probably go ahead with the approval of the work of the committee of the whole now, but perhaps, you know, I'm still thinking about it.

74
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we add that to the plan?

75
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,893
[SPEAKER_15]: If I end a meeting, you could... I think that while it was important to

76
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Though, we are far from done.

77
00:13:51,487 --> 00:14:03,010
[SPEAKER_15]: My colleague Mr. Ruggiero asked for, and I don't see it noted here, but there was also an ask for a report on things like how many compressors we have.

78
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,571
[SPEAKER_15]: water heaters, just so that we had a list.

79
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:20,400
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we started out, and it was four years ago, or three and a half in November, we really had gone through the schools and put together a comprehensive list, which I understand that Christine had told us that we are, you know, we've been hitting items on that list.

80
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:31,966
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the very end of the meeting, we talked about, we had a conversation that wandered into saying, you know, there's still a lot of people in our community who have grave concerns about the high school.

81
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:39,130
[SPEAKER_15]: There's this question about what's functional and what's aesthetically pleasing.

82
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:48,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Many of us have long been concerned, just like City Hall down in Boston has the same type of architecture that our high school does.

83
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:51,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anything that we can do?

84
00:14:51,477 --> 00:14:53,057
[SPEAKER_15]: We've actually never looked into

85
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:57,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a paint that works?

86
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:05,907
[SPEAKER_15]: I did comment that there is a building over in Arlington that used to look very much like our high school did.

87
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:07,849
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the DSS building.

88
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:15,694
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've made it look from externally, I'm talking externally, much, much better.

89
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:22,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, the external factors for me, landscaping and making it look nicer that way,

90
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:25,477
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we actually need to do more exploration.

91
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:29,142
[SPEAKER_15]: We had some discussions, some thoughts went out at that meeting.

92
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:40,976
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that there's concern about having another subcommittee, because my initial desire would be saying, I think we need

93
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:56,821
[SPEAKER_15]: a working subcommittee of really members who are willing to do a little bit of, during, and I would suggest that we do it during the summer, doing some more research into some of these other questions around the high school.

94
00:15:57,661 --> 00:16:02,543
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not putting together a motion right now because I want to talk to members to say, how should we do this?

95
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:03,863
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we go forth?

96
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,164
[SPEAKER_15]: But we have to discuss these issues more thoroughly.

97
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:09,228
[SPEAKER_15]: and take a look at those concerns.

98
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:16,442
[SPEAKER_15]: I walked through the high school again, and you know, my biggest, you think about what is functional.

99
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:26,116
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm thinking about being functional as a school committee member and being what is my first impression.

100
00:16:26,656 --> 00:16:31,698
[SPEAKER_15]: And you do get kind of blind to what someone's first impression would be.

101
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,619
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's certainly issues.

102
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:38,381
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm just going to put it on the table now to say to my

103
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:44,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Colleagues, I think we only just began in that discussion.

104
00:16:45,264 --> 00:16:46,624
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not the first go-round.

105
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:47,945
[SPEAKER_15]: I can assure you of that.

106
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:53,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Those discussions have been had comprehensively across the city about creating lists.

107
00:16:53,527 --> 00:17:05,392
[SPEAKER_15]: But it is time that we look again so that we feel when we're looking at more capital improvements in the future, we will be going back to information that we've gathered at this time.

108
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:07,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

109
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:07,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

110
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:08,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Ruggiero.

111
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:10,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

112
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:18,362
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of the landscaping, I want to know, is it possible that we could create maybe a small scholarship for students?

113
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:26,170
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can open up to them for a design contest, maybe something like $1,000, $2,000 scholarship to college or a college bond.

114
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:30,453
[SPEAKER_13]: And we could allow our students to actually present ideas.

115
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:34,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Is such a program like that possible, Madam Superintendent?

116
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:40,914
[SPEAKER_14]: We definitely could have students work on design.

117
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:44,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I was thinking about some of our art students possibly.

118
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:59,708
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that could be a project that they could work on in terms of with all of the sports clubs and things that we have, extracurricular activities.

119
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:03,271
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of scholarships and things like that,

120
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:12,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not really clear in terms of is that the right way to go in terms of design, but we could definitely ask students.

121
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:18,253
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be something working with CCSR where they're always thinking about projects.

122
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:25,555
[SPEAKER_14]: So it could definitely be something that we could have students get involved with helping to design.

123
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:33,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah I really like the idea that I mean of course we could always go out to bid and have a bunch of professionals look at it.

124
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:38,435
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think it'd be a really fun project for a number of students to actually have an opportunity to have like a little contest.

125
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:44,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it's not a scholarship maybe it's an award and a plaque that we present at a school committee meeting.

126
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:53,022
[SPEAKER_13]: But regardless I'd like to make a motion that we explore this option with the superintendent and she can come back with to us with a report at her leisure.

127
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:54,703
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion is there a second.

128
00:18:56,774 --> 00:18:57,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Mr. Russo.

129
00:18:57,955 --> 00:18:58,695
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

130
00:18:59,055 --> 00:18:59,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

131
00:18:59,315 --> 00:18:59,935
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

132
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:00,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

133
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:03,937
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all set.

134
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:06,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto.

135
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:06,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

136
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Paulette, I agree with you.

137
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:17,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that this is a beginning of a conversation to make not only that building but all areas around our schools better.

138
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:18,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I know last summer that

139
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:26,410
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a walk around the outside of all the elementary schools and identified areas that needed to be improved.

140
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:33,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And John did an amazing job with his team beautifying a lot of that, those areas.

141
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:34,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I want to give kudos to them.

142
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:36,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it has begun.

143
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we need to do that at the high school.

144
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:46,318
[SPEAKER_05]: But while I was at an event up at the vocational school the other night,

145
00:19:48,223 --> 00:20:01,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Donovan outside in the dock with Fritz and our station manager, our community access manager, they were out there putting up spotlights through the high school.

146
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:05,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And he has pictures on his Facebook account and I have some on my phone.

147
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:07,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll share them so we can add them to the blog.

148
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:12,219
[SPEAKER_05]: They had up lights, blue lights of the whole high school and it looked amazing.

149
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And certain doorways were all lit up blue.

150
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,263
[SPEAKER_05]: It transformed the whole area.

151
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,058
[SPEAKER_05]: and they had up lights around the things.

152
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:26,582
[SPEAKER_05]: He also noted that we do have great lighting up there now because it was dark, but it's very harsh lighting.

153
00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:39,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe he said he might be able to help us get filter over them so it's still bright, but not as prison yard-like, might have been the wording.

154
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:42,756
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one thing.

155
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,477
[SPEAKER_05]: But it looked amazing.

156
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:48,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And just seeing that little difference made a huge difference walking in.

157
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And Fame was up there this weekend.

158
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,482
[SPEAKER_05]: They had Fame written on the wall of the high school.

159
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:55,943
[SPEAKER_05]: It was beautiful.

160
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:58,645
[SPEAKER_05]: The school looked really, really pretty.

161
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:07,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of different ways we can put lipstick on it to make it look prettier.

162
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:18,738
[SPEAKER_05]: So I make a motion to, I second, well, I agree with both my colleagues who want to look at this issue and do some beautification.

163
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:18,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

164
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:20,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Van de Kloot.

165
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:41,101
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had a discussion with the superintendent about the concerns about creating another subcommittee We have building and grounds so I think that that would probably be the place Place for us to to go to with this, but I think that if we could I don't know if we could look at it.

166
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:41,822
[SPEAKER_15]: You know for me

167
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:48,106
[SPEAKER_15]: having, because we don't have a lot of other events and meetings during the summer, the summer would be a good time to spend some time.

168
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:52,267
[SPEAKER_15]: So if there were, if there was the will, that's what I think we should do.

169
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:59,388
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to send the topic, if I make a motion to send the topic to Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee, we'll do that.

170
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:00,728
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a motion on the floor.

[SPEAKER_12]: I watched the meetings at home, and you guys gave him some great kudos.

206
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:42,598

00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:46,080
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to see him and others in the GBL.

209
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Not GBL.

210
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:48,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm jumping ahead.

211
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:48,822
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

215
00:23:57,766 --> 00:24:01,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Got the Robert Pierce Award, Sportsmanship Coaching Award,

216
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:06,421
[SPEAKER_12]: which the great thing about this award is the nominations come from officials.

217
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:13,285
[SPEAKER_12]: So anybody who's coached or anybody's been around athletics, sometimes the officials and the coaches don't see eye to eye.

218
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:20,389
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is a true testament to John's professionalism, sideline demeanor, and his leadership for Meffitt High School.

219
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:22,990
[SPEAKER_12]: John's one of our hardest working coaches.

220
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,211

00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:28,433

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, members of the committee, Superintendent Vincent, Mayor Burke.

229
00:25:03,131 --> 00:25:06,774

230
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:07,935
[SPEAKER_09]: So I used to run around this place.

231
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:11,118
[SPEAKER_09]: We had more keys to the city floating around our house.

232

[SPEAKER_03]: All been changed.

233
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,020
All been changed.

234
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,882
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually, the ceremony was.

235
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:19,465
[SPEAKER_09]: My brothers and I used to hit each other with them.

236
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:23,208
[SPEAKER_09]: It is truly an honor to, the game of basketball has been real good to me.

237
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:26,551
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is truly an honor to coach your hometown team.

238
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,571

[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Maloney, I'm always very grateful to have the opportunity to coach in my hometown.

241
00:25:39,897 --> 00:25:42,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Coach Southwick, who's here, who runs our Medford travel program.

242
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:46,320
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people care about the benefit of basketball in this city.

243
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've had a very good year this year.

244
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,002
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing I'm most proud of is we have good kids.

251
00:26:18,085 --> 00:26:18,525

265
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,681
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could, I'll just speak a little bit on behalf of the Fitzpatrick family.

266
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:05,324
[SPEAKER_00]: The women of the Fitzpatrick family considered Medford home, no matter where they lived later in life.

267

269
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Many Fitzpatrick family members attended the Medford Public Schools and became educators themselves.

270
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:32,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Other members of the family taught in middle and high schools, including assignments on Native American reservations in the Southwest.

271
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:35,849
[SPEAKER_00]: One member of the family earned her library of science degree.

272
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:42,054
[SPEAKER_00]: One was a pioneer law school graduate in 1940, balancing night school with a full-time job.

273
00:27:42,815 --> 00:27:51,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Another was a professor of economics at Boston University and Lesley University, where her specialty was labor economics, especially for women in the workforce.

274
00:27:52,555 --> 00:28:03,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of their career choices and decisions and life stories of their sisters, mothers, aunts, grandmothers, and cousins, all of them were deeply committed to women's equal rights and to equal education.

275
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:13,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Their own family has inherited a valuable legacy of strength and independence that the family is happy to acknowledge and share with us all today.

276
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:21,230
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fitzpatrick family is proud to donate an iPad to a deserving eighth grade student in mathematics at the McGlynn Middle School.

277
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:27,512

278
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:35,614
[SPEAKER_00]: The monetary donation to the Drama Club will be used to offset the cost of purchasing the rights to the upcoming school place.

279
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:42,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, in the month of March, the Drama Club performed the Brothers Grimm Spectaculathon, and the shows are fantastic.

280
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:48,958
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wonderful to see teamwork on display at the school, from the lights technicians, to the backstage crew, to the actors and actresses,

281
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:58,642
[SPEAKER_00]: And to all the public relations team, to the eighth graders that contributed to the beautiful set decorations, everyone did a superb job and made the school community very proud.

282
00:28:59,463 --> 00:29:14,688
[SPEAKER_00]: This monetary donation will be used in the future to help to offset and support future performances that brings our school community together and to also help develop and nurture the lifelong skills that these students learn as a result of being a part of the drama club.

283
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,962
[SPEAKER_00]: My recommendation, I'd love to have you consider to accept these donations for the McGlynn Middle School.

285
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:24,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Mr. Tucci.

286
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:25,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice job.

287
00:29:25,704 --> 00:29:30,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to thank the Fitzpatrick family for their kind donation to our school system.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

296
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:48,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you probably have to stay up there, Nick.

297

[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:11,360

[SPEAKER_03]: Also, recommendation to approve a donation of a chair to the Columbus Elementary School.

323
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:17,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

324
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:18,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Caldwell is absent tonight.

325
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:21,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Maurice, would you like to?

326
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:32,140
[SPEAKER_14]: So the parents of a child at the Columbus Elementary School donated a special chair designed to improve focus.

327
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:35,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Our recommendation is for the school committee to

328
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:41,114
[SPEAKER_14]: except the chair, and in your packets you saw a sample of it.

329
00:30:42,517 --> 00:30:46,445
[SPEAKER_14]: And so Kathy Principal, Dr. Kay,

330
00:30:48,497 --> 00:30:51,139
[SPEAKER_14]: wrote a letter to the family, dear Mr. Bernstein and Ms.

331
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:58,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Hudson, I recently learned of your incredible generosity towards the students of the Columbus Elementary School.

332
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:03,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore, I want to send this formal thank you for the chair you donated to Ms.

333
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Burke's first grade classroom.

334
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:10,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I am sure this seat will provide many years of improved, focused learning.

335
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:12,979
[SPEAKER_14]: It is through the support of parents like you

336
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,262
[SPEAKER_14]: that helped make the Columbus a fun and interactive place to learn.

337
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,123
[SPEAKER_14]: I cannot thank you enough.

338
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:20,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

339
00:31:21,324 --> 00:31:23,105
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, no relation to Ms.

340
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:23,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Burke.

341
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:27,348
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Ms.

342
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:28,728
[SPEAKER_03]: DiBenedetto, seconded by Ms.

343
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Kratz.

344
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:30,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote, please.

345
00:31:37,994 --> 00:31:39,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

346
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:40,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

347
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:45,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Recommendation to approve grant funding for composting project at Medford High School.

348
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Curtis Tooden is with us this evening.

349
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:58,092
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mrs. Mayor, Dr. Vinson, and school committee members, thank you for your time tonight.

350
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:02,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here as the faculty advisor to the Medford High School Environmental Club.

351
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:08,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Four students here tonight took the initiative beginning last year to prioritize composting in the school.

352
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,666
[SPEAKER_08]: This winter, they submitted a grant to the Captain Planet Foundation for $2,500.

353
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:17,331
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was such a great grant, they were awarded it just a few weeks ago.

354
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:19,133
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, it's a great thing.

355
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:27,428
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a substantial amount of money that I think will go towards a long-lasting composting program in the school.

356
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:29,569
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll start small this year and then build up.

357
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:31,849
[SPEAKER_08]: We thank you for your support.

358
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:38,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also want to make sure that we thank the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

359
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:40,872
[SPEAKER_08]: They are the club that organized the students to begin with.

360
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:44,493
[SPEAKER_08]: And then thank you to the Crystal Campbell Memorial Foundation.

361
00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:49,555
[SPEAKER_08]: The CCSR and that group are what provided the matching grants that made our application possible.

362
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:55,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, finally, thank you to the Captain Planet Foundation, which is actually that old cartoon back in the day.

363
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,162
[SPEAKER_08]: They have an environmental foundation that is where we were fortunate to find some money.

364
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:07,247
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mr. Skorka and Mr. Trotta couldn't be here today from CCSR and Crystal Campbell, but they said to make sure we got a photo.

365
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:10,029
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to invite the students up at this time, if that's okay.

366
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:11,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Would anyone like to present right now?

367
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, you did a great job when you came to visit.

368
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:15,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on up.

369
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:15,873
[SPEAKER_08]: At least for a photo.

370
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:18,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Feel free to ask them questions.

371
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:19,996
[SPEAKER_08]: They're now composting experts.

372
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:30,865
[SPEAKER_03]: How excited are you that your project's coming to fruition?

373
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:31,906
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fabulous.

374
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:33,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to say thank you or something?

375
00:33:34,168 --> 00:33:34,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's stepping up?

376
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:41,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you tell me logistically how composting will work with high school students?

377
00:33:42,997 --> 00:33:43,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

378
00:33:45,919 --> 00:34:01,050
[SPEAKER_16]: So composting, our plan is to start in just one cafeteria and basically we're implementing composting bins and we'll have student volunteers to monitor and make sure that students are using correct bins for trash and composting.

379
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,333
[SPEAKER_16]: And then at the end of the day, they're going to walk the bins out to a pickup location.

380
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:11,182
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to contract a composting company to come pick up the bins once a week, I believe.

381
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:12,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

382
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:13,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job.

383
00:34:14,866 --> 00:34:14,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

384
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:15,567
[SPEAKER_05]: DiBenedetto.

385
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:16,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

386
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:17,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the project.

387
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a one-year project, or will we have the pickup for additional years?

388
00:34:24,582 --> 00:34:27,243
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a one-year grant that is not renewable.

389
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:30,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So this will allow us to start the process.

390
00:34:30,244 --> 00:34:35,667
[SPEAKER_08]: And a similar grant a few years ago for $1,000 got us through three months of composting.

391
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:41,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And then because a student graduated and we didn't have the support at the time, the project went away.

392
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:46,571
[SPEAKER_08]: But a group working at Medford High School is prepared to take this on again with a lot more money.

393
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:54,034
[SPEAKER_08]: And then hopefully it becomes a sustainable program that spreads throughout all the cafeterias and all the kitchens and things like that, really all the schools, ultimately.

394
00:34:54,514 --> 00:34:56,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Feature you, give your name, and your grade.

395
00:34:58,795 --> 00:34:59,555
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Rachel Klein.

396
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:00,416
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in 11th grade.

397
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,396
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Katie Stefani.

398
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:03,477
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm also in 11th grade.

399
00:35:04,717 --> 00:35:05,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Evian Upshur.

400
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:06,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in 11th grade.

401
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,198
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm Audrey Soule, and I'm also in 11th grade.

402
00:35:10,218 --> 00:35:10,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

403
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:12,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Great job.

404
00:35:12,299 --> 00:35:13,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent job.

405
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Want us all to jump?

406
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:19,661
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll come to you.

407
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:54,160
[SPEAKER_01]: what they've asked for you or David.

408
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:04,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Composted in the carbon pollution offset.

409
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,296
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you have to calculate that and give it to them.

410
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:08,877
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm like, how do you do that?

411
00:37:08,897 --> 00:37:15,641
[SPEAKER_08]: From our experience with the first round of composting a few years ago, we actually get full reports on how much is composted by weight.

412
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:20,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So based on what materials are included in that, you can do a calculation on what the carbon offset is.

413
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:24,647
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's all stuff that right now goes to a landfill and emits carbon.

414
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:28,449
[SPEAKER_08]: But if done in a composting system, then you can count it as offset CO2.

415
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:30,610
[SPEAKER_11]: So the people that pick it up give you a report?

416
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

417
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:32,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, all right.

418
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:33,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's like receipts and all that.

419
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:37,854
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's nobody out there like dealing with the compost, trying to like weigh it and all this like... No, no.

420
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:38,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, how do you do that?

421
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:42,257
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just bins on wheels the same as the other waste currently.

422
00:37:42,277 --> 00:37:48,020
[SPEAKER_08]: They're given different colors and they go to a different curb to get picked up by a private company.

423
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:48,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

424
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're still figuring out the best options for that.

425
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:51,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

426
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good, thank you.

427
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

428
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:57,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Placed it on file by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Ms.

429
00:37:57,822 --> 00:37:58,262
[SPEAKER_03]: VanDekloot.

430
00:37:58,742 --> 00:37:59,422

[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations, ladies.

436
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:05,905
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be about two weeks until we get the check, and then we'll be able to get the check.

437
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:06,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Off to the races.

438
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:07,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good, thank you, Curtis.

439
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:15,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Item seven, report on, oh, I'm sorry, we're back to motion to resort to the regular order of business.

440
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:20,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Giro, all those in favor?

441
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:20,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

442
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:21,766
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

443
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:22,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Resort.

444
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:24,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's revert instead.

445
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:24,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Reverse.

446
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a very long day.

447
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Item one, superintendent's update and comments.

448
00:38:31,617 --> 00:38:32,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Superintendent.

449
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, everyone.

450
00:38:36,362 --> 00:38:39,525
[SPEAKER_14]: First, I would like to congratulate the Medford Family Network

451
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:47,393
[SPEAKER_14]: on their hugely successful sixth annual night of 10,000 lights held here at City Hall on Saturday evening.

452
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:57,761
[SPEAKER_14]: As all of you know, the Family Network is led by Marie Cassidy, a dedicated Dynamo who always puts our children and families first.

453
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:00,143
[SPEAKER_14]: We are so blessed to have her.

454
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:12,649
[SPEAKER_14]: and clearly Tufts University noticed her outstanding service as they will be awarding her an honorary degree in public service during their commencement exercises on May 19th.

455
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:16,910
[SPEAKER_14]: We congratulate Marie on this most wonderful honor.

456
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:26,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Shannon Deimos, the assistant principal at the Brooks Elementary School.

457
00:39:27,107 --> 00:39:29,630
[SPEAKER_14]: who won a seat on the Tewksbury School Committee.

458
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:39,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Shannon is a dedicated educator in our community, and we wish her luck as she adds this role to her already outstanding portfolio.

459
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:52,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd also like to say congratulations to Sarah Grant and the Medford High School Drama Club on their outstanding production of the musical Fame this past weekend.

460
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,827
[SPEAKER_14]: All the shows were sold out and everyone who attended raved about the students' performances.

461
00:40:01,147 --> 00:40:13,616
[SPEAKER_14]: I would also like to congratulate the students, teachers, and staff on the Brooks Annual Disco-themed Viva Variety Show that was held this past Friday and Saturday evenings.

462
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:20,421
[SPEAKER_14]: The show featured skits, singing, dancing, poetry reading, and entertaining musicians.

463
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:24,944
[SPEAKER_14]: The evening began with a staff video entitled, We Are Family.

464
00:40:25,744 --> 00:40:30,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Both nights the school was packed and the performances were fun and uplifting.

465
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:32,369
[SPEAKER_14]: A great job done by all.

466
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:45,858
[SPEAKER_14]: This coming week, on Thursday, April 11th, the Medford Public Schools Office of Clinical and Behavioral Services, in conjunction with the Massachusetts Partnership for Youth

472
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:26,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Last week, MIDE engineers visited the McGlynn Middle School and worked with the entire 6th grade in conducting the experiments

473
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:40,638
[SPEAKER_14]: that incorporated STEM curriculum shared by the math and science teachers to include not only the concept of density, but also the measurement and calculation of volumes of different shapes and related terms.

474
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:46,821
[SPEAKER_14]: It was rewarding to watch students develop their hypotheses and observe the results.

475
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:53,485
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford Public Schools appreciates our partnership with MIDE, and I also would like to thank

476
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:57,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Assistant Principal Jody Lu for helping to organize these events.

477
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,180

479
00:42:12,725 --> 00:42:20,709
[SPEAKER_14]: It was highlighted on Channel 4, WBZ, by the news anchor Paula Eben in her Eye on Education segment.

480
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:28,238
[SPEAKER_14]: The students raised money for this project through a GoFundMe page and by organizing the Mr. MHS pageant.

481
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:34,962
[SPEAKER_14]: It is so rewarding to hear about how our students are caring for others, both in our community and beyond.

482
00:42:36,394 --> 00:42:45,219
[SPEAKER_14]: This weekend, Medford High School girls softball hosts its annual Crystal Campbell Memorial Tournament at Columbus Park.

483
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,464
[SPEAKER_14]: The tournament kicks off with an opening ceremony this Saturday, April 13th at 9.30 a.m.

[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, during April vacation week on Wednesday, the 17th, the softball team will be hosting the Red Sox World Series Trophy at John Brewer's Tavern.

490
00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:27,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Patrons will be able to take photos with the trophy

491
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:34,155

506
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:30,177

507
00:45:31,158 --> 00:45:37,161
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to thank Fred DelaRusso for all of the personal effort that he made as well.

508
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:37,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

509
00:45:39,813 --> 00:45:45,217
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could also add, last Monday evening we had a couple of the representatives from the CCSR.

510
00:45:45,237 --> 00:45:50,661
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Joseph Schmidt and Jenny Lu that spoke about their projects and at the time we

511
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:52,122
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew.

512
00:45:52,142 --> 00:45:58,706
[SPEAKER_03]: The city knew that they had received a grant for $2,000 to work on their enslaved project.

513
00:45:59,046 --> 00:46:05,429
[SPEAKER_03]: There are over 50 individuals that are buried in our old Salem Street burial ground that have no markers on them.

514
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:06,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So no one knows they're there.

515
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:15,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And these students, Joe and Jenny, along with Liam and Jasmine, third graders at the Brooks School, worked together to put in a grant.

516
00:46:15,714 --> 00:46:19,336
[SPEAKER_03]: And they raised $2,000 from the grant, $2,000 from GoFundMe.

517
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:20,277
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hear that there's another $2,000

518
00:46:21,355 --> 00:46:22,656
[SPEAKER_03]: out there that's about to come.

519
00:46:23,117 --> 00:46:25,299
[SPEAKER_03]: But the students should be really, really proud of themselves.

520
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:26,620
[SPEAKER_03]: They did an amazing job.

521
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And to get this grant, it was one of the first ones that had been awarded.

522
00:46:30,303 --> 00:46:37,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were so thrilled with the topic and what these youngsters are doing and how much they care about our community.

523
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:41,034
[SPEAKER_03]: So kudos to all of them and public acknowledgment for all their hard work.

524
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:44,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

525
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:49,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to accept her report and place it on file by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

526
00:46:49,384 --> 00:46:49,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanden Kloot.

527
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:51,045
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

528
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:52,285
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

529
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:52,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

530
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:56,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

531
00:46:56,587 --> 00:46:59,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to quickly bring up an issue around MCAS.

532
00:46:59,268 --> 00:47:02,709
[SPEAKER_11]: MCAS testing is ongoing, or has been ongoing forever.

533
00:47:07,002 --> 00:47:13,029
[SPEAKER_11]: from the community that there was some concern about whether MCAS testing results were at all involved in your academic placement.

534
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:22,339
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to hear the superintendent confirm that no matter what you score on an MCAS, that has nothing to do with your placement when you go to the next grade or high school.

535
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Academic placement.

536
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:24,762
[SPEAKER_03]: MCAS and MCAS.

537
00:47:26,103 --> 00:47:31,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, from my understanding, the MCAS does not, when you're saying placement, let me qualify it.

538
00:47:31,906 --> 00:47:36,648
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some students at the middle school level, you're saying transitioning from middle to high school?

539
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:36,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

540
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:44,772
[SPEAKER_14]: So some students, depending on the level of math that they may have taken, may be on a different,

541
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:55,119
[SPEAKER_14]: If they took a more accelerated math in eighth grade, they would then move to a different level at high school.

542
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:56,981
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's not the MCAS.

543
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,582
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not related to the MCAS.

544
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,703
[SPEAKER_14]: It's related to how they're performing.

545
00:48:00,784 --> 00:48:01,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

546
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:01,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

547
00:48:02,645 --> 00:48:03,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Russo.

548
00:48:04,987 --> 00:48:07,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up, item 7, report on credit for life fare.

549
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:09,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Bernadette Riccardelli.

550
00:48:15,157 --> 00:48:15,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

551
00:48:16,098 --> 00:48:16,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

552
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:26,427
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am here tonight to deliver a report on the recent Credit for Life Fair that took place at Medford High School last Friday.

553
00:48:27,148 --> 00:48:30,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Several of you were there, and we thank you for coming.

554
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:35,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And to member Kathy Kretz, thank you so much for your volunteer work.

555
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:40,698
[SPEAKER_02]: As I just said, the fair occurred on April 5th.

556
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:43,481
[SPEAKER_02]: It occurred in the morning from 845 to approximately 1245, again in the gymnasium.

557
00:48:49,355 --> 00:48:53,458
[SPEAKER_02]: The goals for the program were multifold and included the following.

558
00:48:53,838 --> 00:49:13,070
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted students to understand that the selection of a career has implications for spending opportunities, to understand the importance of good credit and its implications on attaining loans, and we wanted them to understand that living within one's means involves balancing resources in a responsible manner.

559
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:17,673
[SPEAKER_02]: The activities the students were involved in centered around those themes.

560
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:28,383
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted them to role play being an adult for the day, having to make hard decisions, having to learn how to balance what they had with what they wanted.

561
00:49:30,243 --> 00:49:42,547
[SPEAKER_02]: As you probably know, the district was granted a $2,500 grant this year from the Massachusetts Division of Banks in partnership with the State Treasurer's Office.

562
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year it was a $5,000 grant.

563
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:47,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year was the seed grant.

564
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:48,994
[SPEAKER_02]: This year was the follow-up grant.

565
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:54,258
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not sure what availability there will be for next year.

566
00:49:54,938 --> 00:49:57,020
[SPEAKER_02]: We do want to continue with this grant.

567
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:02,683
[SPEAKER_02]: We find it to be, first of all, a lot of work, but we do think that it's worth it.

568
00:50:03,064 --> 00:50:06,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Feedback from the students has been very positive.

569
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, as we move on, we always see that there are ways to improve it.

570
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:23,809
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the areas for improvement that we see is for those of you who were there, at the end, students need to reconcile the decisions that they've made.

571
00:50:24,209 --> 00:50:29,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a very long line in front of the credit counseling area.

572
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:34,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathy Kretz, thank you so much because you stepped in at the last moment to help with that.

573
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:43,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we move forward, that will definitely be an area that we hope to strengthen with additional counselors.

574
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:48,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Our community outreach was vast.

575
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:51,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to thank Lisa Evangelista for that.

576
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Her role primarily was in outreach to the community to get our volunteers.

577
00:50:56,722 --> 00:51:04,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want a special thank you to the State Treasurer, Deborah Goldberg, and the Office of Economic Empowerment for helping us to fund the grant.

578
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:09,966
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a host of other entities that volunteered their time.

579
00:51:11,287 --> 00:51:12,707
[SPEAKER_02]: They are on our blog.

580
00:51:13,143 --> 00:51:15,964
[SPEAKER_02]: A thank you to all of them are listed on our blog.

581
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:25,287
[SPEAKER_02]: The planning committee included myself, Gail Trainor, who put in an immense amount of work, and I really think she took charge of this project.

582
00:51:26,407 --> 00:51:36,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Kristin Kulin, who is a vocational teacher, she had her business and marketing students do a lot of the input onto the budgeting sheets.

583
00:51:36,923 --> 00:51:39,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So it fit very nicely in within their learning program.

584
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, Lisa Evangelista.

585
00:51:43,766 --> 00:51:47,207
[SPEAKER_02]: There were 310 students who signed up for this event.

586
00:51:49,248 --> 00:51:54,650
[SPEAKER_02]: We invited students, obviously, from the high school, the vocational school, and from the Curtis Tufts School.

587
00:51:55,190 --> 00:52:04,013
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, a very worthwhile event, something that we hope is going to be deeply embedded in the tradition of Medford Public Schools.

588
00:52:05,313 --> 00:52:07,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I can speak first-hand from the students.

589
00:52:07,194 --> 00:52:08,494
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very excited about it.

590
00:52:08,814 --> 00:52:10,094
[SPEAKER_03]: They certainly learned a lot.

591
00:52:10,114 --> 00:52:12,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Eye-opening, I guess would be the word.

592
00:52:12,975 --> 00:52:14,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really got a lot out of it.

593
00:52:15,036 --> 00:52:16,777
[SPEAKER_03]: When they were finished, they were like, wow.

594
00:52:17,157 --> 00:52:21,858
[SPEAKER_03]: They couldn't believe how much things cost and how little money goes.

595
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:24,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was very educational.

596
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:26,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that they really enjoyed them.

597
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathy jumped in behind a table.

598
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:30,953
[SPEAKER_03]: did great, Mr. Russo I saw, and Ms.

599
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:31,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Van de Kloot.

600
00:52:32,173 --> 00:52:40,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was a really good showing, along with all the business communities that participated and had doodads, trinkets, and just offered assistance.

601
00:52:40,397 --> 00:52:42,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you to everybody who was involved in this.

602
00:52:42,737 --> 00:52:45,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing job, year two down, and great job.

603
00:52:45,879 --> 00:52:46,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

604
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:47,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Look forward to it next year.

605
00:52:47,919 --> 00:52:48,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

606
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

607
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:56,263
[SPEAKER_11]: So without detailing where the money gets spent for this project,

608
00:52:58,939 --> 00:53:02,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this in any of the budget proposals we are going to be hearing?

609
00:53:02,602 --> 00:53:04,883
[SPEAKER_11]: And if not, why not?

610
00:53:05,403 --> 00:53:07,865
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure where it would actually fit.

611
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,626
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of a strange thing, but.

612
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a very good question.

613
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:15,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I have talked to Paul DeLeva.

614
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I've asked him to incorporate it into the high school budget.

615
00:53:19,873 --> 00:53:22,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Christine Patterson, the assistant superintendent, is aware.

616
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:26,117
[SPEAKER_02]: She was an active participant, and I think she sees the value in it.

617
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really fall within a department.

618
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,541
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of transcends.

619
00:53:32,582 --> 00:53:39,747
[SPEAKER_02]: The total cost of this, again, we have the $2,500 grant.

620
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:45,632
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a $2,000 donation from student activities from the high school.

621
00:53:46,072 --> 00:53:50,576
[SPEAKER_02]: It was rough, and then we got a little bit from Cummings, about $700 from Cummings.

622
00:53:51,737 --> 00:53:56,080
[SPEAKER_02]: The total cost to run the grant this year was lower than last because we had a lot of the

623
00:53:56,595 --> 00:54:00,057
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the infrastructure, we had a lot of the signs made.

624
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:00,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It was roughly $4,700.

625
00:54:01,217 --> 00:54:09,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am hoping that we can include that in what we spend.

626
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:14,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a one-day, one-morning event, and it's amazing because it goes by so quickly.

627
00:54:15,004 --> 00:54:19,986
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think of the amount of time, the number of meetings that we have in planning,

628
00:54:22,027 --> 00:54:26,671
[SPEAKER_02]: in the classes because we bolstered it with some math work in the math classes.

629
00:54:27,972 --> 00:54:31,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing how much work went into this for a one-and-a-half-a-day event.

630
00:54:33,636 --> 00:54:35,738
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I do think it's worthwhile.

631
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:37,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for asking that question.

632
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:38,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job.

633
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job.

634
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:42,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to receive this report and place it on file by Ms.

635
00:54:42,123 --> 00:54:43,464
[SPEAKER_03]: DiBenedetto, seconded by Ms.

636
00:54:43,504 --> 00:54:44,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Van de Kloot.

637
00:54:44,525 --> 00:54:45,225
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

638
00:54:45,245 --> 00:54:45,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

639
00:54:45,986 --> 00:54:46,606
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

640
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:47,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

641
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:48,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Doctor.

642
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:55,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Recommendation to approve name change from Foreign Language Department to World Language Department.

643
00:54:56,183 --> 00:54:56,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Riccadeli.

644
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:57,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

645
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:03,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to call up the lead teacher for the Foreign Language Department, Vilma Bebo.

646
00:55:03,888 --> 00:55:12,614
[SPEAKER_02]: She has very much been a partner with me all year, and we both would like to deliver this request.

647
00:55:14,998 --> 00:55:15,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, everybody.

648
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:16,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

649
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very excited to be here and I'm very excited about this proposal.

650
00:55:20,344 --> 00:55:29,433
[SPEAKER_10]: When I came to Medford last year, one of my first questions was to my director, Akam is foreign language and not world language.

651
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:38,102
[SPEAKER_10]: It just makes sense to change the name into a world language to encompass the multiculturalism and multilingualism.

652
00:55:38,466 --> 00:55:43,548
[SPEAKER_10]: that we teach here in Medford, and that we represent this beautiful district.

653
00:55:44,128 --> 00:55:53,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Myself, as being multicultural and multilingual, it is important to see the teaching and the learning of languages as a world language, and not just foreign.

654
00:55:53,432 --> 00:56:02,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Foreign indicates something that is far away and not really representing the world in terms of a global goal.

655
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:17,556
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to support this and make a motion to approve the change of language so that our language department would now be called world language.

656
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,341
[SPEAKER_15]: that this was the right thing to go.

657
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:27,482
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm also very excited that you brought this forward to us and said, hey, we should do this.

658
00:56:27,542 --> 00:56:28,322
[SPEAKER_15]: This makes sense.

659
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:34,344
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, sometimes we're just thinking this way, and then someone else comes in new and goes, oh, yeah, right.

660
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:35,584
[SPEAKER_15]: And this was one of those.

661
00:56:35,624 --> 00:56:36,504
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much.

662
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:37,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

663
00:56:37,845 --> 00:56:38,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

664
00:56:38,705 --> 00:56:39,985
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a motion on the floor by Ms.

665
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:41,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Vander Kloof, seconded by Mr. Russo.

666
00:56:41,546 --> 00:56:42,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote, please.

667
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:43,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

668
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:52,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

669
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:53,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

670
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:54,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto?

671
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:54,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

672
00:56:54,613 --> 00:56:55,434
[SPEAKER_05]: On this?

673
00:56:55,514 --> 00:56:56,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this is regarding this.

674
00:56:56,795 --> 00:57:15,728
[SPEAKER_05]: At our meeting last week when we were discussing languages, we asked for a follow-up report on the number of students at each grade level and which languages they currently took and what they were planning on taking for next year so we could help with our budgeting plan.

675
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:22,424
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that that's not on the back of our questionable... It's in the budget committee.

676
00:57:22,664 --> 00:57:23,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.

677
00:57:25,306 --> 00:57:30,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer your question, we have been looking at the numbers.

678
00:57:30,609 --> 00:57:32,350
[SPEAKER_02]: We have spent the last week looking at the numbers.

679
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:35,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have some preliminary numbers.

680
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:36,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

681
00:57:39,175 --> 00:57:42,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we wait until they're finalized?

682
00:57:43,157 --> 00:57:43,437
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

683
00:57:43,578 --> 00:57:45,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can present it in budget committee.

684
00:57:45,819 --> 00:57:45,939
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

685
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:47,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will do that.

686
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:50,141
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly we've done a lot of talking about this.

687
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:52,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

688
00:57:52,742 --> 00:57:53,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

689
00:57:53,463 --> 00:57:54,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

690
00:57:54,143 --> 00:57:54,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Great idea.

691
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:55,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

692
00:57:56,864 --> 00:58:00,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Item 9, report on the status of the gymnastics facilities at Medford High School.

693
00:58:00,666 --> 00:58:01,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Maloney.

694
00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:07,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening again.

695
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:08,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

696
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:16,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Last Tuesday, we had two technicians out from Dairy Gymnastics, which they're renowned in the whole New England area.

697
00:58:17,612 --> 00:58:20,253
[SPEAKER_12]: They did a thorough walk through the gymnastics room.

698
00:58:21,593 --> 00:58:22,813
[SPEAKER_12]: I sent a report to you.

699
00:58:22,973 --> 00:58:25,254
[SPEAKER_12]: There were three areas that came back poor.

700
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:32,116
[SPEAKER_12]: The first two were the anchors that hold the parallel bars together.

701
00:58:32,136 --> 00:58:33,116
[SPEAKER_12]: They need to be upgraded.

702
00:58:34,196 --> 00:58:37,417
[SPEAKER_12]: And we need a couple of mats upgraded on the tumble track.

703
00:58:37,884 --> 00:58:39,225
[SPEAKER_12]: and underneath the beams.

704
00:58:41,066 --> 00:58:41,747
[SPEAKER_12]: That price was $3,600.

705
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,549
[SPEAKER_12]: You have the quote in front of you.

706
00:58:44,569 --> 00:58:48,712
[SPEAKER_12]: I've since pulled a PO to have those two jobs done.

707
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:53,896
[SPEAKER_12]: The last area that came back poor was the floor.

708
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,257
[SPEAKER_12]: It's old.

709
00:58:55,377 --> 00:58:56,278
[SPEAKER_12]: It's antiquated.

710
00:58:57,259 --> 00:58:58,960
[SPEAKER_12]: It's two and a half, two inches.

711
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,782
[SPEAKER_12]: The new standard's four and a half, four inches.

712
00:59:03,328 --> 00:59:06,650
[SPEAKER_12]: You have that quote in front of you.

713
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:07,131
[SPEAKER_12]: It's $20,000.

714
00:59:08,732 --> 00:59:11,734
[SPEAKER_12]: So the gymnastics room is safe right now.

715
00:59:12,094 --> 00:59:13,155
[SPEAKER_12]: It's open for business.

716
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:15,196
[SPEAKER_12]: The coaches do a great job up there.

717
00:59:15,236 --> 00:59:17,037
[SPEAKER_12]: They work hard with community schools.

718
00:59:18,018 --> 00:59:19,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Kids Corner uses it.

719
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:20,380
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got the cheerleaders in there.

720
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,561
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got the physical education classes in there.

721
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,603
[SPEAKER_12]: We have our gymnastics team in there in the winter.

722
00:59:25,523 --> 00:59:31,828
[SPEAKER_12]: So the first two out of three items were approved already by City Hall.

723
00:59:33,113 --> 00:59:34,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Christine, the money train.

724
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:43,158
[SPEAKER_12]: So the last part, I'm sure we'll be having further discussions on how we can get a new floor up there.

725
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:46,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Ruggiero.

726
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:50,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thank you very much for this report.

727
00:59:50,542 --> 01:00:01,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Just out of curiosity, so reading through the manifest here, and when I read the floor is fair poor, is there a risk that children will be injured using it?

728
01:00:04,158 --> 01:00:04,938
[SPEAKER_12]: It's deemed safe.

729
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:16,342
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem is the older the floor is, and as you can tell, it's not my background in gymnastics, but they get less bounce out of it, so it's less safe.

730
01:00:16,422 --> 01:00:21,584
[SPEAKER_12]: But right now we have community school members up there that, you know, they're young kids.

731
01:00:21,644 --> 01:00:24,325
[SPEAKER_12]: They're in the kindergarten through sixth grade level.

732
01:00:26,286 --> 01:00:28,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if we can compete on it next year or not.

733
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:31,068
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be another discussion.

734
01:00:32,164 --> 01:00:35,007
[SPEAKER_12]: It's safe to use as is right now for the phys ed classes.

735
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:37,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Kids Corner are the little kids at Meffitt High School.

736
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,671
[SPEAKER_13]: How old is the floor exactly?

737
01:00:41,652 --> 01:00:43,133
[SPEAKER_12]: The floor was there before I got there.

738
01:00:43,193 --> 01:00:48,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I talked to Paul DeLaver today who was a former gymnastics coach.

739
01:00:48,497 --> 01:00:49,958
[SPEAKER_12]: He thinks it's up with the 15 to 20 years old.

740
01:00:49,978 --> 01:00:50,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

741
01:00:56,383 --> 01:00:56,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

742
01:00:56,603 --> 01:00:57,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Grutz.

743
01:00:57,423 --> 01:00:57,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Bobbie.

744
01:00:57,964 --> 01:00:59,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had a question.

745
01:00:59,404 --> 01:01:02,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I know in the report we got, it says here like poor.

746
01:01:02,766 --> 01:01:04,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It says maintenance is required.

747
01:01:04,767 --> 01:01:08,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Items should be replaced before the start of the next competitive season.

748
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:19,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So that seems like we would have to have this done before the next competitive season, which might start up in August.

749
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:21,754
[SPEAKER_12]: The next competitive season is the Monday after Thanksgiving.

750
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:23,275
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

751
01:01:24,872 --> 01:01:29,635
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're going to hold gymnastics tournaments there next year, it probably should be replaced.

752
01:01:29,735 --> 01:01:36,279
[SPEAKER_12]: If not, if we have to go on the road for a year, I mean, obviously, if we can get the $20,000, we can do it right away.

753
01:01:36,339 --> 01:01:40,041
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know money is its own conversation.

754
01:01:40,582 --> 01:01:43,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I do see the concerns that Paul has had adding it to the budget.

755
01:01:43,524 --> 01:01:53,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is something that we should really think about, because we do have to have it replaced before the next competitive season, which would mean it would have to fall in either

756
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:56,639
[SPEAKER_06]: year one or year two in the capital plan.

757
01:02:04,145 --> 01:02:05,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a point of information or a question?

758
01:02:07,148 --> 01:02:07,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Question?

759
01:02:07,888 --> 01:02:08,108
[SPEAKER_03]: None.

760
01:02:09,089 --> 01:02:09,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

761
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:10,811
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hold it for a second.

762
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:11,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

763
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:11,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Van de Kloot.

764
01:02:13,052 --> 01:02:23,481
[SPEAKER_15]: So my concern is once we have an opinion like this, which clearly specifies, you know, the new four-inch power spring system is far superior

765
01:02:24,643 --> 01:02:27,925
[SPEAKER_15]: upgrading the spring floor system will be a night and day difference.

766
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:38,895
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so reminded of the young woman I once met who was a high school gymnast and she was practically had suffered many injuries.

767
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:43,279
[SPEAKER_15]: So when I, I'm very concerned about the potential for injuries here.

768
01:02:43,299 --> 01:02:47,502
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know we can say that forever, but we've now got the report here.

769
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,445
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to see this was not in our

770
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:54,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Thinking when we did the capital plan, we just talked about a capital plan.

771
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:58,931
[SPEAKER_15]: We talked about the potential of available money from the city.

772
01:02:59,051 --> 01:03:11,854
[SPEAKER_15]: If there were to be money, I think that we should either look for it to be in this current year, if there's any left over at the end of the year, once the books are settled, or be placed into year two.

773
01:03:13,575 --> 01:03:16,756
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm thinking, again, I'm no expert in this.

774
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:28,482
[SPEAKER_15]: but I'm always concerned about the potential of injuries, and clearly there is any number of students or groups of students who use this, and so I'm concerned.

775
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:37,327
[SPEAKER_15]: So my motion is to look to see whether we can place this in the capital plan for either year one, and if not year one, then year two.

776
01:03:38,808 --> 01:03:41,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you make it a solid motion to include it?

777
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:44,752
[SPEAKER_15]: To include it in the capital plan, either year one,

778
01:03:45,757 --> 01:03:46,478
[SPEAKER_15]: or year two.

779
01:03:46,718 --> 01:03:47,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Summertime of year two.

780
01:03:47,939 --> 01:03:48,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that the.

781
01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:49,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Ms.

782
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:49,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Kretz.

783
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:54,323
[SPEAKER_15]: So it could be replaced prior to the fall competition.

784
01:03:55,024 --> 01:03:55,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

785
01:03:56,425 --> 01:03:57,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Russo's next?

786
01:03:57,385 --> 01:03:57,926
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm fine.

787
01:03:58,646 --> 01:03:59,046
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all good?

788
01:03:59,187 --> 01:03:59,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

789
01:04:00,107 --> 01:04:00,207
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

790
01:04:00,367 --> 01:04:01,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Benedetto.

791
01:04:01,288 --> 01:04:01,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

792
01:04:03,069 --> 01:04:09,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if it needs to be in a capital improvement plan or added to next year's budget.

793
01:04:09,494 --> 01:04:15,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know which is the better way to do it, because we do have athletic budget that came before us earlier tonight.

794
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:41,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure if this warrants a capital plan and a superintendent of finance would be able to address that, whether we should just put it in for next year's budget under the athletics department and not have to go through city council approval and all of that and make sure that we have the funding there to make sure our gymnasts are all set for the day after Thanksgiving.

795
01:04:43,517 --> 01:04:44,578
[SPEAKER_05]: a different way to look at it.

796
01:04:44,698 --> 01:04:45,098
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

797
01:04:45,378 --> 01:04:49,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Just making sure those funds are available and accessed right away.

798
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:52,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Also... Maybe Christine can find it in community schools.

799
01:04:53,421 --> 01:04:55,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's my next question.

800
01:04:56,623 --> 01:05:00,684
[SPEAKER_05]: When I asked for this to be put on the agenda, I also asked for the finance piece.

801
01:05:00,724 --> 01:05:04,906
[SPEAKER_05]: How much are we actually making from renting out that area of our school?

802
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we have those numbers.

803
01:05:07,547 --> 01:05:08,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I got them for you.

804
01:05:08,087 --> 01:05:08,527
[SPEAKER_05]: You want them?

805
01:05:08,968 --> 01:05:09,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do.

806
01:05:10,427 --> 01:05:15,230
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the first year they're currently running the minus 652 as of today.

807
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:18,752
[SPEAKER_12]: They have 135 kids this year.

808
01:05:18,772 --> 01:05:20,132
[SPEAKER_12]: They generally have 235 to 300 kids.

809
01:05:20,172 --> 01:05:21,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year, that program made $11,000.

810
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:22,374
[SPEAKER_12]: The prior year, $10,000.

811
01:05:22,434 --> 01:05:23,014
[SPEAKER_12]: The prior year, $10,000.

812
01:05:23,074 --> 01:05:25,235
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the prior year, $3,000.

813
01:05:25,275 --> 01:05:27,156
[SPEAKER_12]: So that program has made money for the gymnastics room.

814
01:05:39,813 --> 01:05:46,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So are any of those funds reallocated back into the equipment and the maintenance of that area that you're aware of?

815
01:05:47,097 --> 01:05:52,940
[SPEAKER_12]: If the gymnastics coaches come to me for something, like for $1,500 or $2,000, I never say no.

816
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,641
[SPEAKER_12]: But $20,000 is a big ticket item.

817
01:05:56,461 --> 01:05:59,583
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're clearly raising that money over a few years.

818
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,244
[SPEAKER_12]: They have, prior to this year, yeah.

819
01:06:01,664 --> 01:06:03,305
[SPEAKER_12]: They always get a spike with the Olympics.

820
01:06:03,345 --> 01:06:04,205
[SPEAKER_12]: They do a good job.

821
01:06:04,265 --> 01:06:07,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone wants to be the next alley raiser.

822
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,111
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I would move to add this $20,000 to this year's budget.

823
01:06:13,191 --> 01:06:14,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion on the floor?

824
01:06:15,111 --> 01:06:15,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded.

825
01:06:15,811 --> 01:06:19,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we can't have conflicting motions, unfortunately, unless one wants to withdraw.

826
01:06:19,992 --> 01:06:22,693
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't care.

827
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:23,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

828
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,173
[SPEAKER_03]: You just want it done.

829
01:06:24,793 --> 01:06:25,094
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens.

830
01:06:25,154 --> 01:06:26,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want it done.

831
01:06:26,514 --> 01:06:30,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And I look to you as mayor to say, let's do it this way.

832
01:06:30,995 --> 01:06:34,636
[SPEAKER_15]: We can put it into our regular budget.

833
01:06:34,696 --> 01:06:36,976
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually makes a great deal of sense.

834
01:06:37,757 --> 01:06:39,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And we may be able to get it accelerated.

835
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,163
[SPEAKER_05]: So I make a motion to add this $20,000 to the athletic budget.

836
01:06:44,363 --> 01:06:44,863
[SPEAKER_03]: You withdrew?

837
01:06:44,883 --> 01:06:48,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I withdrew and I'll second.

838
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:49,007
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

839
01:06:49,027 --> 01:06:52,110
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion that $21,000 be added to the athletic budget, Ms.

840
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:52,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Patterson.

841
01:06:54,452 --> 01:06:56,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Giro.

842
01:06:57,775 --> 01:07:00,257
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, because I'm a little confused still, so let me ask again.

843
01:07:00,537 --> 01:07:03,380
[SPEAKER_13]: So will the floor be safe for next year?

844
01:07:04,497 --> 01:07:07,160
[SPEAKER_13]: If we didn't fund this program.

845
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:16,649
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say I'd have to get somebody back out to see if we can compete on it for one more year, but eventually it's like putting a B&A on it.

846
01:07:16,689 --> 01:07:17,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, I understand.

847
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:21,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that if we do do it this year that it needs to be done.

848
01:07:22,033 --> 01:07:22,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

849
01:07:23,034 --> 01:07:23,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

850
01:07:23,535 --> 01:07:23,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

851
01:07:25,397 --> 01:07:26,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Vandekloot-Splinken?

852
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:28,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you good?

853
01:07:28,399 --> 01:07:28,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

854
01:07:29,852 --> 01:07:30,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

855
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:30,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

856
01:07:31,472 --> 01:07:37,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to continue, if we're going to be doing the floor, can we look at that room and see if it needs a paint job?

857
01:07:37,473 --> 01:07:38,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you don't want to paint.

858
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:38,834
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been painted.

859
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:39,474
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been painted.

860
01:07:39,574 --> 01:07:39,894
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

861
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:44,635
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got some nice community schools, gymnastics coaches did some nice silhouettes on the wall.

862
01:07:45,015 --> 01:07:45,115
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

863
01:07:45,135 --> 01:07:46,075
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got some viennas.

864
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:47,835
[SPEAKER_12]: We had some broken mirrors that we fixed.

865
01:07:49,055 --> 01:07:49,155
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

866
01:07:49,255 --> 01:07:57,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in the waiting area up front, there are some ceiling tiles in the entranceway from the side hall that need to be replaced.

867
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:04,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I just figured since we were in there doing this type of scope of work, it's the right time to look at the whole area.

868
01:08:04,242 --> 01:08:10,304
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll do a walkthrough with John, make sure it's, you know, we have a nice ribbon cutting out there, and the kids will appreciate it, really.

869
01:08:10,744 --> 01:08:15,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And could we just, I know you said you've replaced some equipment.

870
01:08:15,385 --> 01:08:23,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Could we just check all the equipment at that time, make sure that this program's up and running, and maybe put it on a schedule to make sure that URIs are serviced?

871
01:08:23,988 --> 01:08:26,289
[SPEAKER_12]: All the heavy pieces of equipment in this report that you have.

872
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:37,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and so like maybe we keep a list somewhere, like a spreadsheet, like we asked for for other equipment.

873
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:46,352
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really good to have for our athletic equipment, so we replace things as of, like this evening when we're putting more money back into

874
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:53,376
[SPEAKER_05]: the weight room in that area, so that way we don't get fall behind the eight ball and have to replace everything.

875
01:08:53,456 --> 01:08:55,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

876
01:08:55,777 --> 01:08:56,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

877
01:08:58,817 --> 01:08:59,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Bob.

878
01:09:02,278 --> 01:09:03,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

879
01:09:04,018 --> 01:09:04,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

880
01:09:04,718 --> 01:09:05,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

881
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:05,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

882
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:07,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Maloney.

883
01:09:08,179 --> 01:09:10,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Report on superintendent's entry plan findings.

884
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent.

885
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:18,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you everyone.

886
01:09:19,574 --> 01:09:33,284
[SPEAKER_14]: So at the beginning of this past school year, I was tasked, as you know, I'm part of the new superintendent's induction program, which is from the state.

887
01:09:33,424 --> 01:09:39,148
[SPEAKER_14]: DESE offers this program for all first-time superintendents.

888
01:09:42,675 --> 01:09:52,222
[SPEAKER_14]: being new to the district and seeing what my entry plan would look like, I was tasked with really seeing how I would enter the district.

889
01:09:53,022 --> 01:10:04,871
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's most important with an entry is giving yourself time to be able to listen, to be able to learn, and the last step would be to be able to lead.

890
01:10:05,516 --> 01:10:15,262
[SPEAKER_14]: And so as you guys have received the report in hand, I will just quote some particular sections of the report.

891
01:10:15,302 --> 01:10:16,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm on page one.

892
01:10:17,483 --> 01:10:29,871
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, it clearly states, the purpose of my original entry plan was to establish an effective and successful entry into Medford Public Schools.

893
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:33,673
[SPEAKER_14]: The objectives of my entry work are the following.

894
01:10:34,512 --> 01:10:46,235
[SPEAKER_14]: build trust and relationships, assess Medford Public Schools' strengths and challenges, and collaboratively create a plan for improving teaching and learning for students.

895
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:54,618
[SPEAKER_14]: And the three components of the entry plan and the entry plan process are listening, learning, and eventually leading.

896
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:59,339
[SPEAKER_14]: And so in this entry plan report,

897
01:11:00,326 --> 01:11:10,178
[SPEAKER_14]: The last few pages in the appendix, which starting on page 15, but on page 16, 17, all the way through page 20,

898
01:11:17,081 --> 01:11:31,963
[SPEAKER_14]: listed many of the key events that were both community-based or school-based events that gave me an opportunity to not only listen, but to continue to learn about the district.

899
01:11:33,485 --> 01:11:47,250
[SPEAKER_14]: learn what's important, what matters, what makes Medford Public Schools tick, what makes Medford Public Schools a special place that it actually is and that I love coming to every day to work.

900
01:11:49,489 --> 01:11:56,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I talk in the entry plan about how there were challenges at the start of the school year.

901
01:11:57,498 --> 01:12:05,266
[SPEAKER_14]: When I started in July, we had some administrative shifts that took place, and we had to be very responsive.

902
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,249
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that was something which kind of

903
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:16,295
[SPEAKER_14]: That became our highest priority to make sure that all schools were ready and open and prepared to start strong.

904
01:12:16,836 --> 01:12:19,338
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's a very important commitment.

905
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:33,533
[SPEAKER_14]: At the beginning of the school year, we received our finalized state results from the state testing to see what our status was with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Ed.

906
01:12:35,233 --> 01:12:42,495
[SPEAKER_14]: I had many, many opportunities to be in all of the schools to interact with not only school leaders,

907
01:12:43,308 --> 01:12:56,435
[SPEAKER_14]: teachers, students, and itinerants, directors, all of the staff that make Medford Public Schools the rich place that it actually is.

908
01:12:57,315 --> 01:13:11,343
[SPEAKER_14]: I had the opportunity to meet with many political officials that have come to visit the school, to welcome me to Medford, but also to see what is Medford Public Schools doing.

909
01:13:12,933 --> 01:13:28,042
[SPEAKER_14]: We had some unexpected events where we had media coverage at the beginning of the school year when we were dealing with excessive heat and when we had the bullet casing that was found at the back of the high school field.

910
01:13:29,163 --> 01:13:37,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I mentioned how we had to have two evacuations in one day at the high school, again, out of an abundance of caution.

911
01:13:37,968 --> 01:13:41,650
[SPEAKER_14]: So there were many, many events that have happened since the start of the school year.

912
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:49,808
[SPEAKER_14]: But during that time of listening, I had the opportunity to truly learn a lot.

913
01:13:50,948 --> 01:13:52,630
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I am now on page 8.

914
01:13:55,032 --> 01:14:05,419
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I entered, I had the opportunity to sit down one-on-one with you, all of the school committee members, and all school leaders.

915
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,703
[SPEAKER_14]: And I asked the following questions.

916
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:13,607
[SPEAKER_14]: What is our greatest strength as a district?

917
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:16,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Or what are you most proud of?

918
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:19,946
[SPEAKER_14]: in terms of the work that you're doing in Medford Public Schools?

919
01:14:20,726 --> 01:14:25,027
[SPEAKER_14]: What is a challenge that Medford needs to address?

920
01:14:25,947 --> 01:14:32,909
[SPEAKER_14]: And are there ways that I can either support your growth and development, which I spoke with the school leaders about?

921
01:14:33,349 --> 01:14:41,551
[SPEAKER_14]: And for school committee members, I asked about are there particular special projects or initiatives that you would like to see the district address?

922
01:14:42,132 --> 01:14:43,512
[SPEAKER_14]: And so those were the questions.

923
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:57,179
[SPEAKER_14]: that I continued to ask and look at the data from the responses and really figure out what was the body of work that needed to be covered.

924
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:06,725
[SPEAKER_14]: And so on page 8, school committee members and school leaders identified the following areas.

925
01:15:07,686 --> 01:15:13,450
[SPEAKER_14]: A greater focus on CEL, social-emotional learning, and response to intervention.

926
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:41,593
[SPEAKER_14]: at the K-8 level, upgrading technology tools where needed around the district, a more effective focus on math, addressing perceived salary inequities among administrators, addressing the impacts of the different schedules at Medford High School and the vocational school, ensuring safety throughout the entire district,

927
01:15:43,435 --> 01:15:58,646
[SPEAKER_14]: addressing the middle school challenge, and looking at staffing needs from custodians to kindergarten aides to adjustment counselors, paraprofessionals, teachers, and administrators.

928
01:16:01,188 --> 01:16:08,013
[SPEAKER_14]: From assessment data, I looked at, as a district, I looked at our MCAS assessment.

929
01:16:08,778 --> 01:16:14,346
[SPEAKER_14]: to see where we were standing in terms of with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

930
01:16:14,907 --> 01:16:21,477
[SPEAKER_14]: And in comparison to some of our surrounding districts, how are we performing in comparison to the state?

931
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:39,855
[SPEAKER_14]: And so because we had just a very robust presentation by our directors, I just said let's make reference to the MCAS reports that were previously presented in October of last year and last month, March of 2019.

932
01:16:40,356 --> 01:16:51,262
[SPEAKER_14]: I am also still looking at our subgroup data, because that is important, as well as we look at how our students are performing as a district.

933
01:16:53,570 --> 01:17:09,865
[SPEAKER_14]: From observations and looking at reports and contracts, this year a significant amount of time of my entry process has been dedicated to collective bargaining agreements, the CBAs.

934
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:16,612
[SPEAKER_14]: This year all of our contracts were up and we have

935
01:17:17,198 --> 01:17:19,199
[SPEAKER_14]: successfully completed seven.

936
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:25,303
[SPEAKER_14]: We are still working on finalizing four more CBA contracts.

937
01:17:25,784 --> 01:17:35,530
[SPEAKER_14]: So that has really given me a great opportunity to get to understand the details of all of the different contracts, working with those unions,

938
01:17:36,546 --> 01:17:44,729
[SPEAKER_14]: and working collaboratively with you, the school committee, and we've been discussing the majority of the contracts in our executive sessions.

939
01:17:45,389 --> 01:17:50,051
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was an important piece of my learning as well for how the district is working.

940
01:17:50,951 --> 01:17:52,312
[SPEAKER_14]: And looking at other documents.

941
01:17:53,612 --> 01:17:57,854
[SPEAKER_14]: We looked at school improvement plans, school safety plans.

942
01:17:58,414 --> 01:18:03,676
[SPEAKER_14]: We had our plans that were submitted to us, which we are working on.

943
01:18:04,368 --> 01:18:07,389
[SPEAKER_14]: to continue to improve safety at all of our schools.

944
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:18,672
[SPEAKER_14]: We have looked at master schedules and trying to find ways to align schedules, improve schedules, so we maximize time on learning.

945
01:18:19,712 --> 01:18:22,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking at enrollment projections and

946
01:18:23,393 --> 01:18:49,161
[SPEAKER_14]: the patterns, our fluctuating numbers of our newcomers, English learners that are coming in, looking at staffing allocations, attendance data, looking at both students and staff across the district, financial documents, which we look at all the time when we have school committee meetings, but really looking at our finances.

947
01:18:49,781 --> 01:18:52,342
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I think about us as a district,

948
01:18:53,174 --> 01:19:03,522
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, although we have normally we're allocated approximately 58 million, we need $60 million plus to operate.

949
01:19:03,602 --> 01:19:08,305
[SPEAKER_14]: So every year we need to close a $2 million gap, which is significant.

950
01:19:09,146 --> 01:19:19,093
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I do spend a lot of time with Christine because we realize that it takes a lot to run the entire district and to run it well.

951
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,365
[SPEAKER_14]: I looked at district policies and I've met with several subcommittees.

952
01:19:26,885 --> 01:19:29,868
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're looking at policies that either need to be updated.

953
01:19:31,229 --> 01:19:38,095
[SPEAKER_14]: And so a lot of time has been spent looking at documents as well and how we can continue to improve.

954
01:19:40,539 --> 01:19:49,824
[SPEAKER_14]: From school visits and conversations with students, being in schools, normally teachers are teaching, so I don't interrupt them.

955
01:19:50,144 --> 01:20:02,711
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I will have conversations with them during instructional observations, but when I am observing in a classroom, I always go to the students and ask them to tell me, what are you working on?

956
01:20:03,311 --> 01:20:07,253
[SPEAKER_14]: And so if the students are able to explain it in their own language,

957
01:20:07,853 --> 01:20:10,575
[SPEAKER_14]: that they truly understand what they're working on.

958
01:20:11,715 --> 01:20:15,337
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that the teacher has already fully explained it to the students.

959
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:25,502
[SPEAKER_14]: So I truly enjoy having conversations with students, being in classrooms, observing, being with the administrators, seeing that work happen as well.

960
01:20:27,263 --> 01:20:35,347
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I'm in schools, if I'm not, a teacher is not directly instructing school leaders and or teachers

961
01:20:35,717 --> 01:20:37,617
[SPEAKER_14]: will always have conversations with me.

962
01:20:38,538 --> 01:20:40,638
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been welcomed back to classrooms.

963
01:20:41,638 --> 01:20:44,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Teachers have really received me warmly.

964
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,760
[SPEAKER_14]: I have many teachers that have said, when are you getting to my classroom?

965
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,920
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I say, I'm coming back.

966
01:20:52,520 --> 01:21:02,682
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had students request me to return to their classroom to continue to be part of their learning and just support the instruction that's happening.

967
01:21:03,162 --> 01:21:06,203
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that has been very, very positive.

968
01:21:07,203 --> 01:21:13,785
[SPEAKER_14]: When I come back from being in the field and return to central office, I am beaming.

969
01:21:13,985 --> 01:21:17,786
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like I'm walking on air because it's a charge.

970
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:29,450
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that I have a job to do, but being with the students, being in schools, seeing solid teaching and instruction taking place, it makes you feel like we're moving in the right direction.

971
01:21:30,191 --> 01:21:38,349
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when I think about Medford, I feel like as a district, what I've seen so far is we have really, really good bones.

972
01:21:39,098 --> 01:21:46,162
[SPEAKER_14]: we are in a good position, and I am ready and excited about moving us to the next level.

973
01:21:47,002 --> 01:22:04,871
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I feel like the work that's ahead of us is fine-tuning, improving, and challenging ourselves as a district, and continuing to work collaboratively with school leaders, with the directors, and with teachers.

974
01:22:06,427 --> 01:22:15,965
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is some key work that is already underway that's taking place in the district, and I have highlighted just a few of them.

975
01:22:17,561 --> 01:22:38,860
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a very active, robust partnership with Lesley University, not only in their use of the gym and athletic partnership, but we actually have an academic partnership where they truly are committed to supporting Medford Public Schools and continuing to support our instruction with math learning walks.

976
01:22:40,641 --> 01:22:51,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Patricia Cren de Galarce also supports our special education subcommittee meeting and attends those meetings whenever her schedule permits.

977
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:58,374
[SPEAKER_14]: We have implemented an elementary mathematics coaching program that did not exist before.

978
01:22:58,955 --> 01:23:05,880
[SPEAKER_14]: We have two math coaches that are working at all four elementary schools supporting teachers

979
01:23:06,313 --> 01:23:16,480
[SPEAKER_14]: coaching teachers, working alongside teachers, modeling for teachers, helping to keep their eyes on mathematics, and really giving an additional focus.

980
01:23:18,321 --> 01:23:24,985
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have expanded our Tufts University STEM partnership to middle and elementary schools.

981
01:23:26,606 --> 01:23:34,231
[SPEAKER_14]: We have implemented a full lottery process this year for all middle schools to balance our demographics.

982
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:48,486
[SPEAKER_14]: We are in the process of looking to adopt a new middle school mathematics curriculum because at the middle schools, there are multiple mathematics curriculum that are in place.

983
01:23:49,307 --> 01:23:59,432
[SPEAKER_14]: And so you are getting a lot of varied outcomes from different curriculum, but it's important to have coherence and alignment.

984
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:09,655
[SPEAKER_14]: so that when you're going in to assess a program, you're not looking at one program in one room and you go to another classroom and seeing something that's completely different.

985
01:24:10,155 --> 01:24:13,958
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's something that we are hoping to be able to do.

986
01:24:14,418 --> 01:24:22,243
[SPEAKER_14]: It does need to happen so we can just have consistency, coherence, and alignment for our middle school mathematics.

987
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:28,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, we are launching the FOSS science.

988
01:24:29,101 --> 01:24:30,602
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in our elementary schools.

989
01:24:31,062 --> 01:24:33,824
[SPEAKER_14]: The teachers have been trained, had a wonderful day of training.

990
01:24:34,664 --> 01:24:38,746
[SPEAKER_14]: And they are piloting, and they're all using the curriculum right now.

991
01:24:39,547 --> 01:24:41,788
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's wonderful to see that in action.

992
01:24:43,695 --> 01:24:53,259
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have developed clear expectations for monitoring student progress in reading and in mathematics at the elementary levels.

993
01:24:53,799 --> 01:25:06,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, these systems and structures, we're trying to put them in place so that we are able to better monitor our work and be able to look at the data that comes from that.

994
01:25:08,457 --> 01:25:15,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, we have consistent implementation of our K-2 response to intervention for literacy.

995
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:19,579
[SPEAKER_14]: This year, there was a great focus.

996
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:31,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Chiesa working with all of our elementary schools to make sure that, again, there is consistency and coherence for kindergarten, first, and second grades.

997
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:56,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I did mention the Lesley University SPED subcommittee work, and we have launched a district safety team to examine external reports and streamline safety policies, practices, and routines, including school bus preparedness and homeschool communication systems

998
01:25:56,649 --> 01:25:58,890
[SPEAKER_14]: for programs housed in schools.

999
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:04,313
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's some of the key work that we have been working on thus far.

1000
01:26:05,633 --> 01:26:14,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Our major themes that emerged during this entry process is we clearly have strong Medford pride.

1001
01:26:15,618 --> 01:26:18,640
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mustang Way is alive and well.

1002
01:26:21,089 --> 01:26:30,133
[SPEAKER_14]: We've seen that there are some disagreements about the value of the elementary early release on the Wednesdays.

1003
01:26:30,973 --> 01:26:47,140
[SPEAKER_14]: We've identified that we do have, we currently have some inadequate data systems in terms of how we are housing our internal data, and so that's something that we are looking at intentionally.

1004
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:55,605
[SPEAKER_14]: And so by bringing about some consistent practices, that's going to help with that area.

1005
01:26:56,326 --> 01:27:00,709
[SPEAKER_14]: We are also working on addressing students' social-emotional learning needs.

1006
01:27:02,830 --> 01:27:14,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, we know that we have weaker mathematics performance, and so we are continuing to keep a very close watch on how we are working in mathematics.

1007
01:27:17,591 --> 01:27:39,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Another theme that emerged is that there's difficulty in taking the maximum advantage of our high school complex between the Medford High School, the comprehensive side, and our vocational technical side, because we currently have two different schedules.

1008
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:43,317
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a five-day schedule and a six-day schedule.

1009
01:27:43,978 --> 01:27:52,185
[SPEAKER_14]: And so trying to make the schedules match is a challenge.

1010
01:27:52,525 --> 01:27:58,570
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's something that was in their collective bargaining agreement.

1011
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:03,214
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is something that we are really paying close attention to.

1012
01:28:03,735 --> 01:28:09,620
[SPEAKER_14]: because Medford High School, the complex has so much to offer our students.

1013
01:28:13,164 --> 01:28:27,817
[SPEAKER_14]: It's exciting being at the high school complex, but because the schools are on two slightly different schedules, if we can get the schedules to align, then we would be able to have even more students

1014
01:28:28,437 --> 01:28:37,421
[SPEAKER_14]: benefiting from being a Mustang at the high school and having opportunities, greater opportunities on both sides of the house.

1015
01:28:37,881 --> 01:28:45,785
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's something that we're very aware of and we are trying to see how we can make the two schedules work.

1016
01:28:46,345 --> 01:29:03,037
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's going to involve a lot of partnership with the Teachers Association to collaborate with them and say, you know, let's find a way to make these two schedules talk to one another so we can maximize that.

1017
01:29:04,181 --> 01:29:19,432
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last area, again, was emergency preparedness, that we are very aware that it's critically important here in Medford, and just in society and the world this day, and we are taking it very seriously.

1018
01:29:20,633 --> 01:29:32,322
[SPEAKER_14]: So in summation, or in closing, Medford Public Schools is a richly diverse school community nestled within a burgeoning city with such great potential.

1019
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:40,173
[SPEAKER_14]: We are committed to being one Medford that holds high academic standards for all our students.

1020
01:29:40,934 --> 01:29:51,879
[SPEAKER_14]: We are committed to improving ourselves by working collaboratively and tapping into the intellectual capital of the entire school community and our community partners.

1021
01:29:53,400 --> 01:30:01,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford continues to evolve into a special city in which to live, work, and raise our families.

1022
01:30:02,747 --> 01:30:08,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford Public Schools is a supportive and welcoming place that celebrates our diversity.

1023
01:30:09,573 --> 01:30:12,335
[SPEAKER_14]: We see our diversity as a strength.

1024
01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:22,523
[SPEAKER_14]: As Dr. King had preached, the world must learn to live together as brothers and sisters or perish together as fools.

1025
01:30:24,365 --> 01:30:29,249
[SPEAKER_14]: While the face of Medford is constantly changing, that face makes Medford

1026
01:30:29,845 --> 01:30:33,488
[SPEAKER_14]: a more livable, attractive, and welcoming place to be.

1027
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:41,196
[SPEAKER_14]: As I have spent this valuable time listening and learning from colleagues in the community,

1028
01:30:42,116 --> 01:30:47,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I am ever so eager to continue leading this district into the future.

1029
01:30:48,479 --> 01:31:01,424
[SPEAKER_14]: The next phase of this work will be to finish gathering all data for the remainder of this year and present a proposed district strategy for improvement at the start of the next school year.

1030
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:08,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto?

1031
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:09,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1032
01:31:10,161 --> 01:31:13,581
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I really liked all of this.

1033
01:31:13,661 --> 01:31:19,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing to see all the things that you have done in less than one year.

1034
01:31:22,264 --> 01:31:22,804
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot.

1035
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:24,364
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of community time.

1036
01:31:24,424 --> 01:31:30,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of learning for yourself and growth as a superintendent.

1037
01:31:31,846 --> 01:31:34,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to comment, though, most directly

1038
01:31:35,174 --> 01:31:39,656
[SPEAKER_05]: is that your ownership of where we actually are and naming where we are.

1039
01:31:40,056 --> 01:31:47,359
[SPEAKER_05]: In order to move forward, we have to acknowledge where we are, our strengths and our weaknesses, and our areas of growth.

1040
01:31:47,599 --> 01:31:54,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And I respect that and appreciate that in this report and in you as a person as well.

1041
01:31:55,622 --> 01:32:01,745
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, I would like to look towards the mayor to talk to her about the beginning, because there's less

1042
01:32:02,088 --> 01:32:07,470
[SPEAKER_05]: There's between 40 and 45 school days left to this year, this school year, and then we're out.

1043
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:14,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I know 45 school days from today I think is like June 17th, so like we're right there.

1044
01:32:14,972 --> 01:32:17,053
[SPEAKER_05]: We're right there between 40 and 45.

1045
01:32:17,253 --> 01:32:18,953
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really not a lot of time.

1046
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:27,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a committee, we're required to do a review of our superintendent, an annual review.

1047
01:32:27,556 --> 01:32:31,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna look to the mayor to start the process so that way we can,

1048
01:32:32,618 --> 01:32:39,442
[SPEAKER_05]: give feedback of what we've seen for this year, positive, and our future goals for you as well.

1049
01:32:40,543 --> 01:32:45,185
[SPEAKER_05]: And since you brought this forward, I thought it was an appropriate time to start that process.

1050
01:32:46,126 --> 01:32:50,008
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a motion to, I don't know if I have to motion or if I just recommend it.

1051
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:51,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have to do it anyway.

1052
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:52,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Giro.

1053
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:53,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

1054
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:56,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much for this report, Madam Superintendent.

1055
01:32:56,752 --> 01:32:57,733
[SPEAKER_13]: I really enjoyed reading through it.

1056
01:32:58,512 --> 01:33:01,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I do have a question about your major and emerging scenes section on page 13.

1057
01:33:02,075 --> 01:33:11,242
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to know, so obviously we all know that the scheduling issue between the vocational school and the high school is not acceptable.

1058
01:33:12,683 --> 01:33:16,366
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess, and I also know it's going to be a thorny problem to untangle that.

1059
01:33:17,006 --> 01:33:20,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to know what is your timetable and schedule for addressing it?

1060
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:21,710
[SPEAKER_13]: How long do you think it'll take?

1061
01:33:23,571 --> 01:33:25,973
[SPEAKER_14]: So we currently are,

1062
01:33:26,512 --> 01:33:30,773
[SPEAKER_14]: looking at the schedule, and they've been actually looking at the schedule all year.

1063
01:33:31,374 --> 01:33:47,339
[SPEAKER_14]: The challenge is because we have a contract in place for three years, we have to honor the contract which still maintained the separate schedules.

1064
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:55,822
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are continuing to look to see how we could potentially have the two schools

1065
01:33:56,395 --> 01:33:57,216
[SPEAKER_14]: talk to each other.

1066
01:33:58,056 --> 01:34:05,903
[SPEAKER_14]: But in order to do that, it's probably going to take like a year and a half to two years for that to actually be able to happen.

1067
01:34:06,463 --> 01:34:22,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Because on the cooperative side of the house, the vocational side of the house, when the students are doing their co-ops, they have their instructional weeks and then they have their hands-on week.

1068
01:34:23,412 --> 01:34:30,434
[SPEAKER_14]: So we want to keep the integrity of our robust vocational programming in place.

1069
01:34:31,114 --> 01:34:52,320
[SPEAKER_14]: So we need to have time to sit down and really negotiate that with the union and come up with the best plan that will allow the most amount of students to be able to really benefit from both schedules, from what the entire complex offers.

1070
01:34:53,608 --> 01:34:58,912
[SPEAKER_13]: do you anticipate a lot of, for lack of a better word, pushback from the unions on the change?

1071
01:35:02,094 --> 01:35:05,797
[SPEAKER_14]: When you're proposing a change, someone experiences loss.

1072
01:35:07,338 --> 01:35:21,148
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would say where people were accustomed to having a certain schedule, once we say the schedule needs to change, I think initially they may be

1073
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:32,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Saddened because they feel there's a loss but I'm thinking about the students and and you know seeing how much

1074
01:35:34,256 --> 01:35:36,277
[SPEAKER_14]: is available at the complex.

1075
01:35:37,538 --> 01:35:46,042
[SPEAKER_14]: I keep saying, there were so many times that I say to myself, wow, I wish more kids could have access to this.

1076
01:35:46,102 --> 01:35:51,264
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we've even talked about, is there a way to give some students access to minis?

1077
01:35:51,744 --> 01:35:56,807
[SPEAKER_14]: But in order for that to happen, you need to be able to have a schedule which allows that.

1078
01:35:58,828 --> 01:36:03,110
[SPEAKER_14]: But we need to have the conversation, and I'm not sure if that, when the merge,

1079
01:36:03,669 --> 01:36:09,853
[SPEAKER_14]: happened, I don't think that the schedule piece had been tackled at that point in time.

1080
01:36:10,453 --> 01:36:15,937
[SPEAKER_14]: So although the merge happened where the two schools became one, they were still on two different schedules.

1081
01:36:16,477 --> 01:36:24,942
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're, you know, it's in some areas you are able to make it work, but it's, you know,

1082
01:36:26,157 --> 01:36:45,926
[SPEAKER_14]: There's sacrifices that are being made, and if we're able to have one schedule that both schools are operating on the same schedule, then we really would be able to give our high school students a phenomenal learning experience, even greater than what they are already having.

1083
01:36:47,387 --> 01:36:47,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1084
01:36:48,598 --> 01:36:48,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1085
01:36:48,818 --> 01:36:49,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Van de Kloot.

1086
01:36:50,078 --> 01:36:55,080
[SPEAKER_15]: First, thank you, Dr. Maurice Vincent, for the comprehensive report.

1087
01:36:56,140 --> 01:37:06,963
[SPEAKER_15]: I know how warmly the students have taken to you, and it's really great to see you with the students and with the staff out in the field, so to speak.

1088
01:37:08,624 --> 01:37:11,164
[SPEAKER_15]: There's clearly so many different things in here.

1089
01:37:13,298 --> 01:37:26,962
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things I did want to ask is that you mentioned that one of your key work underway is the launching of a district safety team to examine external reports and streamline safety policies, et cetera.

1090
01:37:27,442 --> 01:37:37,485
[SPEAKER_15]: I would ask that the school committee, before the end of the school year, receive, and probably we need to do this because of sensitivity to security issues,

1091
01:37:40,294 --> 01:37:44,235
[SPEAKER_15]: that we would receive a more comprehensive report from this team.

1092
01:37:46,776 --> 01:37:54,618
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyway, other than that, thank you very much for bringing us this report tonight, and I look forward to our future work together.

1093
01:37:56,319 --> 01:37:56,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1094
01:37:56,619 --> 01:37:56,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

1095
01:37:56,959 --> 01:37:57,259
[SPEAKER_03]: VanDekloot.

1096
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:58,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Russo.

1097
01:37:58,960 --> 01:37:59,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1098
01:38:02,096 --> 01:38:12,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I noticed the word policies was used a few times about things you plan to update, and I'm just wondering if there's going to be a bolus of new policies that we need to approve, or do you mean policies that aren't school committee policies?

1099
01:38:16,061 --> 01:38:23,984
[SPEAKER_14]: points that you have brought to our attention is about some of the policies that were outdated that needed to be updated.

1100
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:36,528
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that is something where we're trying to at least begin the process of looking at some of our existing policies that are online to make sure that they are updated and reflective of

1101
01:38:37,648 --> 01:38:37,848
[SPEAKER_14]: now 2019.

1102
01:38:37,928 --> 01:38:46,130
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's something that you clearly brought to my attention.

1103
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:49,551
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's something that we are definitely aware of.

1104
01:38:49,891 --> 01:39:03,254
[SPEAKER_14]: But just the scope of work to go through all of the existing policies that are already there and trying to finish the negotiations and all of those pieces, I could not prioritize that this year.

1105
01:39:03,854 --> 01:39:06,475
[SPEAKER_14]: But it is something that was

1106
01:39:06,815 --> 01:39:10,637
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's important that we take it as a data point and that we do need to have updated.

1107
01:39:11,397 --> 01:39:11,697
Thank you.

1108
01:39:12,737 --> 01:39:34,767
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure where this would fit into the budget, but one of the things I hear from parents who happen to teach in other districts a lot, I've heard it too many times, is that in some districts it seems that there's a data person in every building, which I don't know if that's an exaggeration or there's one there two days a week or what.

1109
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:44,322
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding is we're incredibly light on the data people in our district, and I'm wondering if that's going, not that the people we have aren't great, but there aren't enough of them.

1110
01:39:45,102 --> 01:39:48,063
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm wondering if that's going to be worth coming in the budget.

1111
01:39:48,403 --> 01:39:50,263
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not done, so I don't know where it would be.

1112
01:39:51,443 --> 01:39:58,545
[SPEAKER_14]: And so one of the pieces, or one of my earlier observations where I talked about

1113
01:40:00,692 --> 01:40:04,719
[SPEAKER_14]: where we are trying to consistently progress monitor.

1114
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,203
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think because we had...

1115
01:40:09,943 --> 01:40:14,866
[SPEAKER_14]: different pieces of data that were generated, but it wasn't aligned across the schools.

1116
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:19,649
[SPEAKER_14]: It was difficult to be able to present or paint a picture.

1117
01:40:20,229 --> 01:40:32,376
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that is part of the work that we've also been working on, about bringing coherence and alignment so that we would have consistent data to look at, and then from that data be able to make

1118
01:40:33,497 --> 01:40:35,338
[SPEAKER_14]: strategic informed decisions.

1119
01:40:35,959 --> 01:40:51,131
[SPEAKER_14]: So schools having a data person, schools having functioning, highly functioning instructional leadership teams looking at the data, but they need to be looking at consistent data or the same data.

1120
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:55,275
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are pieces of things that we are working on.

1121
01:40:55,355 --> 01:40:56,936
[SPEAKER_14]: So you will see more of that.

1122
01:40:57,416 --> 01:41:01,360
[SPEAKER_14]: So sometimes you can take a staff person within a school and train them.

1123
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:07,344
[SPEAKER_14]: to support the data work that happens at schools.

1124
01:41:07,805 --> 01:41:08,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

1125
01:41:08,285 --> 01:41:11,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I have one more question.

1126
01:41:11,468 --> 01:41:19,054
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that I know at the middle schools, the schedule every day is different for every kid.

1127
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:24,478
[SPEAKER_11]: And while I recognize the value in your ability to have your specials

1128
01:41:26,121 --> 01:41:32,626
[SPEAKER_11]: for classes that are only for part of the year and all that other stuff that makes it possible to have a teacher in one building and go to another building.

1129
01:41:34,207 --> 01:41:35,148
[SPEAKER_11]: You can fit more in.

1130
01:41:36,169 --> 01:41:44,115
[SPEAKER_11]: But for some kids, especially kids with executive functioning issues and other students with other disabilities, this schedule is an absolute nightmare.

1131
01:41:44,475 --> 01:41:52,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time I go to my son's pediatrician, she just like rolls her eyes like this is the most ridiculous thing in the world.

1132
01:41:54,868 --> 01:42:00,752
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like you can write that into an IEP, that my student won't have a variable schedule day-to-day.

1133
01:42:00,912 --> 01:42:01,672
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not an option.

1134
01:42:02,213 --> 01:42:08,557
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the result is, is that progress reports come out and it's inconsistent performance every single class.

1135
01:42:08,717 --> 01:42:12,319
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because in the morning everything's great, and in the afternoon everything isn't.

1136
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:20,444
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can't build supports to make the afternoon classes better because some days it's the math class, some days it's the English class.

1137
01:42:23,401 --> 01:42:27,043
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just my own, you know, my own experience.

1138
01:42:27,063 --> 01:42:28,524
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not an uncommon thing.

1139
01:42:29,024 --> 01:42:34,867
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just wondering if there's any discussion around ending this variable schedule thing.

1140
01:42:34,887 --> 01:42:37,008
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, is it, everybody does it?

1141
01:42:37,028 --> 01:42:38,709
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand this.

1142
01:42:39,449 --> 01:42:46,513
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was also brought to my attention, the middle school schedule, it does change.

1143
01:42:47,293 --> 01:42:49,234
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it is something that,

1144
01:42:51,203 --> 01:43:13,792
[SPEAKER_14]: I am willing to look at, but similar to what I said earlier, when you are proposing a significant change for what people have been accustomed to having, when you're making a proposal that may not have been as clearly spelled out in the contract, now you have to have a side agreement.

1145
01:43:14,452 --> 01:43:16,193
[SPEAKER_14]: So the middle school schedule,

1146
01:43:17,685 --> 01:43:24,987
[SPEAKER_14]: The two schedules are aligned, although they're moving on, you know, to your point.

1147
01:43:25,887 --> 01:43:30,168
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that is something that is on my radar as well.

1148
01:43:30,208 --> 01:43:31,108
[SPEAKER_14]: I am aware of that.

1149
01:43:31,588 --> 01:43:40,250
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, it's going to involve negotiating with the teachers for the middle school schedule as well.

1150
01:43:43,456 --> 01:43:43,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1151
01:43:43,736 --> 01:43:44,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Kritz.

1152
01:43:44,897 --> 01:43:47,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank you, Dr. Maurice, for this lovely report.

1153
01:43:48,038 --> 01:43:49,118
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic.

1154
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:57,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to repeat what Aaron said, but what I really loved was all the activities, all the events that you went to, and the pictures.

1155
01:43:57,522 --> 01:44:01,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know how you had time to do the report, because you're doing so much.

1156
01:44:01,984 --> 01:44:03,044
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredible.

1157
01:44:03,544 --> 01:44:04,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1158
01:44:04,085 --> 01:44:07,806
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank my team for their support.

1159
01:44:07,826 --> 01:44:09,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's really great.

1160
01:44:11,057 --> 01:44:13,898
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file.

1161
