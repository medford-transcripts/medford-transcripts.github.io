1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:03,174
Whether you call it Medford or Meffa, this place is special.

2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:08,138
It doesn't matter if you're from North, West, Wellington, Hillside, or South.

3
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:11,240
Whether you get your coffee at Lola's or Del Mar.

4
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:15,464
Whether you eat at Murphy's, Rosso's, Oasis, or Jim's.

5
00:00:15,824 --> 00:00:21,989
Whether your grandparents made this place their home a century ago, or you're a late arrival looking to make this place your home today.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:28,314
Traveling the avenues and parkways, or passing neighbors with our headphones on, we tune out much of what's important.

7
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:37,818
Stepping off our worn paths into our communities and communicating beyond the dividing lines, our shared problems and opportunities to address them come into focus.

8
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:41,740
For the past five months of my campaign for City Council, I've done this.

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,962
Walking across eight wards, encountering thousands of residents, and discovering hidden gems.

10
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:55,225
We're surrounded by resources, both material and human, and yet confusion, anger, and distrust are winning out.

11
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:57,947
Disengagement and apathy sets in.

12
00:00:58,867 --> 00:00:59,268
I get it.

13
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:04,572
News feeds and doom scrolling leave many of us strained, hanging on, and pushing through.

14
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,074
But right now is the time to tune in.

15
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:11,238
This city needs our minds, our hearts, and our guts more than ever.

16
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:15,321
Students, singles, families, elders of all origin.

17
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:23,048
We can reclaim reason and balance to turn our path away from increasing fragmentation to one where our residents are informed,

18
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:32,132
our commerce thriving, our budget balanced, our public safety officials and educators respected, our arts and culture integrated.

19
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:37,353
It's time for our standards and governing to turn toward what's honorable and thoughtful.

20
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:42,034
It's time for public disagreement to turn toward reconciliation and kindness.

21
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:51,016
Let's get things working so that we're thriving rather than surviving, not for our egos or tribes, for our neighborhoods and for our city.

22
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:52,556
Let's begin today.
