    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3.833s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5.174s">President,</a>  please rise and salute the flag.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8.576s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=25.563s">Pursuant</a>  to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, Chapter 38, Section 18, and the Governor's March 18, 2020 order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Medford City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=44.69s">Specific</a>  information and guidelines for all participation by members of the public and or parties with a right or requirement <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=51.312s">to</a>  attend this meeting can be found on the City of Medford website at www.medford.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=58.035s">For</a>  this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=65.939s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technology means. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=74.598s">In</a>  the event we were able to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media website an audio, video, recording, transcript, or other comprehensive record of the meeting as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=87.456s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=92.557s">Motions,</a>  orders, or resolutions offered by Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=95.639s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the city administration provide an update regarding the status of contract negotiations with the clerical union staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=103.924s">Vice</a>  President Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=104.965s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=106.306s">Last</a>  week, we made inquiry into the status of the negotiations between our recreation department, building department, and the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=113.27s">And</a>  this week, I'd like to ask for an update on our clerical union. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=116.132s">It's</a>  my understanding that both of these bargaining units have gone without a contract for an extended period of time, and I personally don't see any reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=123.036s">I</a>  think that they should be at the table negotiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=124.798s">If</a>  they're at a stalemate, then let the council know. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=127.5s">But</a>  at this point in time, Mr. President, I'm asking that we get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=130.342s">Unfortunately,</a>  in our packets this week, you will see that the mayor did respond to last week's resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=135.525s">And</a>  her response was, we will not comment on ongoing contract negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=139.648s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that the resolution be forwarded to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=143.371s">with</a>  the anticipation that they see the error in their ways and provide us with the information that we need to make informed decisions moving forward into budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=150.353s">If</a>  in fact these two collective bargaining agreements are settled, it will have a financial impact on this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=155.514s">And</a>  as the financial watchdog in this community, the Medford City Council, the body responsible for the appropriation of funds, I think it's well within our scope and authority to be informed of these decisions and what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=165.257s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=169.323s">A</a>  motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=173.007s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=176.029s">Councilor</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=176.77s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=177.451s">Councilor</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=178.792s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=179.412s">Vice</a>  President Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=180.393s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=180.754s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=181.594s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=182.255s">Councilor</a>  Morell? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=183.036s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=183.536s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=184.317s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=184.757s">President</a>  Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=185.618s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=185.938s">7</a>  in the affirmative, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=189.095s">2-1-374</a>  offered by Councilor Morell, being so resolved that the City Council receive an update from the administration on current 40B project and applications in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=198.783s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=200.204s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=201.425s">Yeah,</a>  this is just seeking an update from the administration on the three ongoing projects, which to my understanding are still making their way through council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=208.65s">As</a>  you know, this is a recurring item. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=210.511s">This</a>  has been placed by yourself on the agenda before. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=213.274s">Just</a>  seeking information and update from the administration, particularly because <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=217.877s">These</a>  three developments are listed in the housing production plan that was delivered to us as affordable housing in the pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=223.963s">So</a>  I'm just seeking to understand if this is affordable housing that is actually coming through or this is actively being fought by the administration and what the update is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=232.751s">So</a>  just seeking a written update from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=235.734s">I</a>  don't know if there's anyone on the call tonight either.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=244.137s">I've</a>  requested to put through a resolution similar to this, but I was told that it didn't, we had this on the agenda less than 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=255.029s">So</a>  I did want to, if I could add to that, just if the Senate administration can also provide us with the, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=265.734s">with</a>  the tax revenue that is being lost right now with the lack of the 40B projects and follow up with the update on where we stand legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=282.058s">I've</a>  been told there was already a hearing today on one and didn't go too favorably for the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=289.604s">So,</a>  which from what I've been told, I think it's going to follow suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=294.208s">So</a>  be interested to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=296.389s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=298.531s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=299.392s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Morell for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=301.594s">I</a>  think most every councilor has actually had a similar resolution to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=307.358s">And</a>  yet we have not received any response from the administration regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=312.1s">And</a>  this is a major issue in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=314.743s">We're</a>  talking about housing and we have got no information from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=321.451s">The</a>  administration wants to be transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=323.093s">They</a>  have to be transparent about this here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=326.077s">If</a>  we had these tied up in court, this is costing us, I'm sure hundreds of thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=333.065s">So</a>  if Councilor Morell wouldn't mind, I'd like to amend the resolution as I've amended, I think most of the other resolutions that have pertained to this matter to find out how much we have spent so far on legal costs regarding 40 Bs and where they are being charged on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=352.002s">And</a>  once again, I just want to thank Councilor Morell for bringing this forward and I second the motion.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=359.688s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=360.669s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell and my fellow councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=364.251s">I</a>  agree with the sentiments that everyone just echoed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=366.593s">I</a>  would just also ask that we amend the paper to request that the administration give us an estimated timeline for when the legal process will be complete for the same reasons that my fellow councilors have outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=378.121s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=381.604s">If</a>  I may, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=384.726s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=386.502s">I</a>  look at this situation with the 40B developments that are going on in this community, Mr. President, and I look at them as missed opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=393.584s">And</a>  we have an administration that campaigns on affordable housing and then fights tooth and nail to prevent it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=399.525s">With</a>  just one of these projects, we're looking at probably close to $2.5 million in permitting fees, probably $250,000 per month in property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=410.132s">And</a>  it seems like it's a frivolous fight when five separate consultants, all independent of each other, say that the city's glam calculations are incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=418.618s">So</a>  I really think, Mr. President, that they should have run a friendly 40B. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=422.461s">We</a>  had Judy Barrett working with us, who's the renowned 40B, friendly 40B expert across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who's no longer with us for a variety of reasons, I think, that surround <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=435.93s">the</a>  ongoing litigation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=437.832s">So</a>  with that being said, I thank the councilors for bringing this up and I certainly look forward to bringing this solution, this issue to a head because we talk about what's going on in the inner belt of 95 and the need for affordable housing and the need to increase housing production. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=452.585s">We</a>  have a housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=453.947s">These</a>  projects are mentioned in them, but where are we?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=457.462s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=458.842s">And</a>  if I could put it, I want to thank Councilor Morocco again. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=461.283s">Like</a>  Councilor Falco said, I think we've all brought this up at some point in the last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=467.665s">And</a>  again, we've gone through the housing production plan, and all we keep hearing about is affordable housing, affordable housing, affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=474.686s">And</a>  we're 670 units away from our magic number. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=478.247s">Again,</a>  unfortunately, this is the only avenue we have for affordable housing in any kind of numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=484.592s">So</a>  I don't know what the holdup is, and I support all my council's resolutions on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=490.436s">And</a>  hopefully, again, another time, this is probably the fifth or sixth resolution doing this, and we get some kind of answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=499.683s">So</a>  on the motion, Councilor Morell, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=503.786s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=504.726s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=505.767s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=508.018s">as</a>  amended council bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=512.621s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=513.141s">Council</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=513.822s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=515.543s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=516.524s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=517.344s">Council</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=525.682s">21375</a>  offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that long time resident business owner in the late Frank Andre be recognized for his dedication and commitment to the residents and businesses owners of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=540.069s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=542.07s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=542.67s">It's</a>  a real honor and privilege tonight to mention the name of Frank Andre. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=550.834s">For</a>  those that do not know Frank, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=553.098s">Frank</a>  was an instrumental part of this community for many, many decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=559.62s">Frank</a>  Andrew was born in Worcester, Mass., and moved to Revere as a young boy, and then permanently located to his beloved Medford in 1936, living on Fulton Street for the next 80 years until his passing in 2016 at age 94. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=579.805s">Frank</a>  lived in Method with his parents, Michael and Phyllis, and siblings, Anthony, Nicholas, Francis, and Lena. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=587.618s">The</a>  family settled at 131 Fulton Street, a home that is still in the family today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=593.672s">A</a>  few years later, Frank met his future wife, Norma Luongo, who lived a few doors down at 105 Fulton Street, and later at 115 Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=605.597s">The</a>  couple married in 1946 and had one son, Chuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=611.68s">Frank</a>  and Norma purchased a new home at 125 Fulton Street with his grandson, Michael, and his wife, Gwen, and their two sons currently reside today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=622.519s">To</a>  complete the family's occupation of the stretch of Fulton Street, Frank built a house for his parents at 137 Fulton Street in 1956, which is now occupied by his granddaughter, Carla. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=637.214s">Frank</a>  was involved in many businesses in Medford in the 1940s and 50s. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=642.416s">Among</a>  other things, he owned a bicycle rental shop, opened Frank Andre's restaurant, and then was involved in Andre's Market with his family, all located on Salem Street and Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=656.961s">In</a>  the early 1960s, Frank focused his attention to building when he founded the Andre Construction Company in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=666.568s">Andre</a>  Construction went on to build over 300 houses, with the majority built in North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=674.231s">Frank's</a>  home still dominates streets like Gaston Street, Haines Street, Mitchell Ave, Andrew Street, Saunders Street, Reeder Drive, Doonan Street, Fulton Spring Road, and many, many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=688.257s">He</a>  also owned many commercial properties in the city, primarily in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=694.821s">It</a>  was through his building and investing in properties that he first became interested in the Dyer Building that was formerly housed the Medford Theater, located at 36 Salem Street, which had fallen into disrepair and had closed in 1964. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=713.138s">Frank</a>  eventually purchased the property along with the prominent local physician, Dr. Anthony Graffio from the Hackett family in 1965 with the idea of converting the building to the then novel idea of constructing office condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=732.17s">Things</a>  suddenly changed for the city of Medford, and in particular Medford Square and its merchants, on the night of November 1st, 1965, when a general round fire ravaged Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=745.946s">when</a>  plans were announced a short time later to construct a new high school on Winthrop Street, Method Square had become dependent on businesses from almost 3,000 students, suddenly was facing a crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=763.462s">with</a>  the square facing the reality of many businesses leaving due to the high school relocation, then Mayor Jack McGlynn approached Frank and asked him to consider renovating the dilapidated theater, building and reopening it as the cornerstone of the Medford Square community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=782.474s">Frank</a>  knew nothing about the theater business, but did his investigative work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=787.776s">And</a>  true to his Medford pride, and in an attempt to revitalize Medford Square, he met with Mayor Jack McGlynn and the city council and renovations began. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=798.34s">On</a>  August 2nd, 1967, Frank proudly opened the newly renovated and then state-of-the-art Medford Cinema. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=807.424s">The</a>  cinema opened to long lines, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=810.945s">with</a>  the first two movies being Disney's Snow White and the comedy hit Never Too Late. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=818.091s">In</a>  1968, Frank opened Cinema 2 by renovating the old Colonial Hall that was located in the second floor of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=828.8s">In</a>  1969, the complex expanded to Medford Cinema 1, 2, and 3, with the opening of Cinema 3 and the then converted balcony. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=838.258s">Over</a>  the next few decades, it was mission accomplished for Medford Square as long lines of patrons waited to watch their favorite movies at Medford's only theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=849.122s">Hits</a>  like The Sound of Music, The Godfather, and Jaws brought thousands of people to Medford Square each week. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=860.831s">Frank</a>  became well-known in the theater circles in 1970 with his innovation of Dollar Night. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=868.014s">On</a>  Mondays and Tuesdays patrons could pay just $1 to see the movie of their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=874.676s">This</a>  spawned huge crowds and also drew the attention of the Massachusetts State Police as it was not uncommon to have traffic at a standstill on Route 93 trying to get into Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=889.697s">Local</a>  businesses thrived because of the success of the cinema. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=894.38s">Carol's</a>  Restaurant, Papageno's, the Pewter Pot, the Method Cafeteria, Savage's Deli, Brigham's, Baskin-Robbins, the Peking on the Mystic, the China Ocean, as well as the counters at Grant's and Woolworth's were all jam-packed before, between, and after all shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=916.491s">In</a>  addition, local merchants in the square started to stay open later and began to thrive again, enjoying the many patrons of the cinema that suddenly became newfound customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=927.801s">Method</a>  Square became revitalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=931.605s">Frank</a>  operated the cinema for decades until the advent of the mall-style multi-screen complexes that put an end to almost all neighborhood theaters. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=942.044s">Frank's</a>  other interests also included the owning of the Andre Thoroughbred Racing Stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=948.871s">Frank</a>  was involved in local sports as well, serving as a long-time manager of the Hawks in the Nob Method Little League, as well as vice president of that league over a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=961.503s">Frank</a>  was a staunch supporter of Medford High School athletics, and his biggest joy was watching his son, Chuck, and grandchildren, Michael and Carla, participate in Medford sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=972.15s">In</a>  fact, his son, Chuck, and his granddaughter, Carla, are the only father-daughter duo currently inducted into the Medford Mustang Hall of Fame. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=982.716s">Frank's</a>  family continues to make Medford their home today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=987.038s">Chuck</a>  and his wife, Kathy, are both lifelong Medford residents, as are their grandchildren, Michael and Carla, and his two great-grandchildren, Leo and Miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=997.33s">Frank's</a>  son Chuck is the founder of Remax Andre Realty Services in Medford Square and continues to own and operate the Andre Chiefs, formerly the Hosmer Chiefs, Medford's only semi-professional baseball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1012.715s">Kyle</a>  is a teacher at Medford High School, while Michael is an executive at neighboring Assembly Row. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1018.757s">Frank's</a>  contributions to the city run long and deep and are still evidenced today by his legacy and ongoing participation of his lifelong Medford family members. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1030.987s">Mr.</a>  President, I respectfully ask that we as a council vote on the motion tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1038.89s">that</a>  a dedication and a plaque be placed in front of 36 Salem Street, which formerly housed the Medford Cinema, honoring and recognizing Frank Andre for his unselfish dedication to the residents and business owners of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1058.718s">Mr.</a>  President, you know, you hear this a lot, but I happen to know the Andre family. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1064.56s">I</a>  knew Frank and his wife, his lovely wife, and Chuck. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1068.561s">And</a>  you couldn't meet a gentler, kinder man, would be the first, Mr. President, to extend a hand if he needed, would be the first to donate, and he did many, many times, keeping Method Sports going, Mr. President, and would be the first to step forward when this community needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1087.587s">And</a>  I think that's evident in what he did, Mr. President, during his part after that awful fire at Medford High School on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1098.142s">And</a>  he was one of the driving forces. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1100.485s">There</a>  were other people, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1102.548s">But</a>  it's fair to say he was one of the driving forces to make the revitalization of Medford Square happen once again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1111.298s">And</a>  I wish we had people like that around now, because we really could use the strong foundation, Mr. President, when it comes to <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1119.768s">looking</a>  at the revitalization currently of Medford Square and the vision that was had back some 40, 50 years ago that I think would still apply now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1130.931s">Hard</a>  work and vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1132.751s">And</a>  that's what Frank Andre and his family was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1136.732s">So</a>  it's with great pride that I ask that this be sent to the administration, Mr. President, and that a plaque and a dedication be held in the very near future on behalf of Frank Andre <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1149.475s">in</a>  his commitment to the residents and business owners in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1155.517s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1157.417s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1158.638s">Outstanding</a>  rendition. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1160.338s">Councilor</a>  Scott Milley.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1162.119s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1167.961s">What</a>  a litany of success that the Andre family has put forth, with especially their patriarch, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1176.542s">This</a>  is why we love Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1178.163s">I</a>  think people, it's funny that you often get confused in lifelong residents in Medford and people looking negatively at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1189.392s">And</a>  when you look at someone like the Andre family, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1193.08s">The</a>  reason why Medford is such a great community and such a great city is families like the Andre family. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1198.825s">And</a>  we can never forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1200.587s">I</a>  tell my kids all the time, you'll never know where you're going if you never know where you came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1205.651s">And</a>  it's important that people like Mr. Andre are remembered <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1211.409s">of</a>  what they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1214.272s">I've</a>  known the Andre family for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1216.033s">I</a>  was lucky enough to coach Collar and I conducted her into the Hall of Fame. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1221.158s">And</a>  again, what Mr. Andre passed off to his son and then passed off to their children, you see the commitment to Medford, becoming teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1234.112s">working</a>  and volunteering for Little League. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1237.936s">When</a>  I was on the board in Little League, if you needed something, Frank was sitting on his stoop watching every single game like a dedicated Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1251.969s">This</a>  is someone that we should find, you know, that we see a lot of names that are deserving this community along the streets, street corners and different plaques and monuments. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1262.434s">But</a>  when you talk about a person like Councilman Mach said, that really stepped up for his community and could have easily walked away and we didn't know where we'd be today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1272.199s">So</a>  again, this is, I wholeheartedly second the motion and congratulate Council Marks for really highlighting a true Method Mustang that should be never forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1284.426s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1285.627s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1286.408s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1288.657s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1289.398s">I</a>  also want to thank Councilor Matz for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1292.082s">As</a>  I was preparing for the meeting, I was reading through the resolution and it couldn't help but bring a smile to my face because I remember the theater as a kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1300.294s">I</a>  remember going and I actually remember seeing Jaws at that theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1304.93s">It</a>  just brought back some memories of, you know, just being a kid and walking through Method Square and doing those types of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1311.174s">And</a>  I never knew that Mr. Andre owned the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1314.176s">So</a>  I just wanted to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and echo the sentiments of my colleague, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1321.561s">The</a>  Andre family has always given back generously in time and donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1326.924s">And</a>  this is a very fitting tribute. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1329.606s">And</a>  I would also second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1331.107s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1332.468s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1332.968s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1334.784s">Maybe</a>  we can get his grandson Michael to come over from Assembly Row and get to work on Medford Square just like his grandfather did. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1340.835s">It'd</a>  be quite a legacy that he could leave behind if that were the case.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1345.41s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1345.93s">And</a>  again, I want to thank Councilor Marks for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1348.413s">The</a>  Andre family is synonymous with many things that meant for the generosity, the commitment, and the Mustang blue runs through their veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1356.96s">And</a>  as many people know, that building is currently going under, it's under renovation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1362.625s">I</a>  will reach out to the owner of the property, who was a friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1365.647s">and</a>  ask him about putting a plaque on the building similar to they did for several other people in the community on different buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1373.872s">So</a>  that was something I'll do tomorrow morning and along with send this to mayor for a sign in front of the building also. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1381.837s">On</a>  the motion, excuse me, Jane W. Jane W? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1388.461s">You</a>  have your hand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1391.443s">Jane</a>  W? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1396.408s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can you unmute Jane W.? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1416.459s">Jane,</a>  I'm sorry, but we're not able to unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1420.804s">If</a>  we can, give me a second.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1422.786s">Is</a>  she trying on her end, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1424.407s">Jane,</a>  can you try on your end to unmute yourself, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1431.592s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1434.654s">We</a>  have Andrew Castagnetti from East Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1437.376s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti, name and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1444.581s">It's</a>  great technology.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1446.402s">Can</a>  we unmute the fire tower, Mr. Castagnetti?</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1455.131s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1459.674s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1461.315s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1462.516s">I</a>  don't know if you can hear me with all this plane noise above me in East Medford.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1471.261s">East</a>  Medford, yes, we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1472.541s">You</a>  can hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1473.742s">Okay,</a>  the plane went by. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1475.403s">I</a>  want to commend Councilor Marks for bringing forward to commemorate <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1483.98s">The</a>  gentleman and Dr. Graffield, for bringing, getting the cinema back into motion, from the ashes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1493.827s">It</a>  was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1495.728s">And</a>  Councilor Marks mentioned all the beautiful businesses we had, World War Western, Grants, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1500.632s">He</a>  neglected only two. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1502.413s">One</a>  was Joe's pool room below the cafeteria on High Street and Forest, and also the small ball bowling where Harvey Van Guyde is also. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1512.823s">And</a>  it was great to have businesses doing some business. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1516.846s">However,</a>  the city, the politicians made a huge mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1520.949s">Back</a>  in 1970, when my wife graduated, that was the last year of the old Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1526.773s">And</a>  unfortunately, they built the new high school and the so-called new high school in the West Medford Woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1533.678s">And</a>  in my opinion, it devastated the Medford Square economically. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1539.262s">And</a>  we've never, ever recovered from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1541.538s">Hopefully</a>  we all learn lessons, especially our next cities around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1545.201s">But</a>  it's wonderful that we commemorate him and have a plaque there for him because he did a lot for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1553.208s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1734.117s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1734.897s">I</a>  bring this resolution again tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1738.438s">I</a>  feel like I bring this at least once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1740.118s">And</a>  the grass at the corner of Webster Street and Fountain Street, there's a kind of like a median strip there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1747.6s">And</a>  as you come out, if you take a left, you can see that the grass is getting really high. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1752.442s">It's</a>  probably over a foot now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1754.229s">And</a>  we can just have someone from the administration, please contact the DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1758.272s">And</a>  if we can have that mode in the interest of public safety, it's a problem that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1765.897s">We</a>  should be addressing these things sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1768.099s">And</a>  we need to take pride in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1772.161s">We</a>  shouldn't be letting the grass like this get out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1774.763s">So</a>  if we could have someone from the administration contact DCR to have this cut as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1780.808s">Councilor</a>  Falco, if you wouldn't mind amending that to doing the whole circle on both sides, not just Webster Street, all four of those corners are a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1790.41s">So</a>  if you wouldn't mind adding that as an amendment to clean the whole rotary on both sides of the highway, because it's pretty high all around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1800.252s">Do</a>  you mean the rotary at- On the Webster Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1803.57s">So</a>  Webster Street and Fountain is like- On the other side of the highway, the grass is pretty tall over there and that whole rotary is a mess too.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1811.455s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1811.996s">That's</a>  fine, I'm open to the amendment, sir, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1919.616s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1921.998s">On</a>  the motion by. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1924.401s">I'm</a>  sorry, God helps the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1925.542s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1926.543s">I</a>  know it's a lot of mirrors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1931.928s">I</a>  would just ask that we also invite mascot because I believe Webster fountain and the Salem Street Rotary are dot not DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1940.067s">Um,</a>  and it's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1941.508s">The</a>  grass is a problem, but the trash is a problem too. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1944.01s">And</a>  I don't even think those two state coordinate agencies are coordinating either. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1947.633s">So</a>  it might be good to have everybody in the room, um, to, to try to iron this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1952.116s">I</a>  live on a state road and it's a big problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1954.438s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1957.761s">Also</a>  because these state agencies sometimes like to thumb their nose at local officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1964.466s">If</a>  we can invite a state delegation as well.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1972.297s">Okay,</a>  on the motion by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1977.88s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by President Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Marks, and as amended by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1986.646s">And</a>  then Councilor Marks again. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1988.007s">Did</a>  I get them all? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1990.968s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2019.676s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2020.437s">I</a>  was notified by a resident last week about the condition of the curbing down at the Freedom Way and McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2029.626s">And</a>  they sent me a number of photos, I took a drive down by myself as well just to take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2034.45s">And</a>  I know back a few years ago, I believe the prior administration had started a project with regard to replacing the curbing at the McGlynn School and I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2044.439s">It</a>  might be finished, it might be partway finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2046.34s">I</a>  know that there is extra curbing that's on the side of the road, but there's still plenty of curbing around the school that some of it's completely obliterated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2055.562s">It</a>  looks like it's just dust on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2057.043s">So</a>  I just wanted to get some sort of an update from the administration as to when that's going to be finished or if it's going to be finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2063.284s">It</a>  doesn't look like there's enough curbing to finish the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2066.547s">but</a>  it does need to be addressed and the company needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2070.79s">If</a>  someone comes from outside of the city and they see our schools like this, it's a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2074.973s">It</a>  doesn't say much about what we're doing about our city and how we're treating our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2079.896s">We</a>  need to make sure we're safeguarding our buildings and our school properties for the future generations of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2085.58s">And</a>  this is a problem that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2087.982s">So</a>  at this point, I'd just like to move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2091.044s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2242.378s">Yes,</a>  I'm in affirmative motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2245.179s">Petitions,</a>  presentations of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2249.822s">21379</a>  petition to reverse sign denial by Gilmar De Silva for Prestige Car Wash 277 Middlesex Ave, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2259.068s">Reason</a>  for denial, movement not permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2263.393s">Councilor</a>  Morell is the chairman of the sign committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2267.516s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2269.116s">I</a>  don't, I know this came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2271.858s">I</a>  don't think we actually, if I'm wrong, I don't think we had a meeting on this one specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2275.18s">I</a>  know this came before us, the multiple awnings, but I do not believe that this made it through our committee for this LED message center.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2284.645s">If</a>  we can, Mr. President, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2287.807s">I</a>  concur with Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2290.72s">I</a>  think what we'll do tonight is reference to send this to the subcommittee on signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2298.706s">I</a>  know we've already met on this with the number of signs we've already allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2303.99s">So</a>  I'm really not in favor of really supporting it with all these lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2309.114s">I</a>  don't know if the council would want to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2311.536s">If</a>  you'd rather send it to subcommittee to get more in depth, I'll support that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2315.64s">But</a>  that's normally the course of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2318.522s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2321.208s">I</a>  mean, I'm happy to vote on it tonight, unless Councilor Marks is also on the subject.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2326.191s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2328.313s">Mr.</a>  President, according to our sign ordinance, we don't allow movement on signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2334.377s">However,</a>  this council over the years, at least as long as I've been on, we have allowed a few signs here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2341.401s">And</a>  for extenuating circumstances, if you have a tough location, if the visibility is difficult, this is not one of them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2350.306s">And</a>  if you drive by, you know, it's great that they give out free vacuums in there, but it looks like it is 45 octopus around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2359.892s">You</a>  got all these new signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2361.673s">The</a>  awnings haven't even gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2363.974s">I</a>  don't know what else they want at that particular location, but I do not support movement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2370.818s">So</a>  if, you know, I mean, we can have a subcommittee meeting, but I will not be supporting this based on the fact that I do not support <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2379.407s">movement</a>  at this location, because I don't see any extenuating circumstance for that location, Mr. President, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2387.952s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2388.612s">And</a>  again, I think the extenuating circumstances that we discussed with the sign movement had to do a lot with churches and showing schedules for Christians at different locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2401.74s">I</a>  think other than that, on this <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2405.915s">I</a>  think the Citizens or the Century Bank that's on 93, that really doesn't really hit any of our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2414.899s">But</a>  again, I'm prepared to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2420.262s">I</a>  don't think that this falls in any need whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2424.704s">Everybody</a>  knows that there is a car wash there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2427.786s">Everybody</a>  knows that there's free vacuuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2433.348s">I</a>  know we've already approved <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2434.911s">the</a>  signage and the awnings that go all the way around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2437.733s">So,</a>  you know, as one resident who's also a customer, I can't see what else you want to put there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2446.8s">I</a>  think everybody and their cousins know that that location's there and what it's offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2453.305s">So</a>  I'm ready to vote and denial myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2455.767s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2456.548s">Councilor</a>  Miss. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2458.509s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli just took the words out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2460.451s">If</a>  you're driving down Middlesex Avenue, you know this car wash is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2463.824s">unless</a>  the committee wants to send it to subcommittee, I would be comfortable voting to deny the reversal tonight.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2469.767s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2470.347s">And</a>  we have Mr. Gilmour on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2472.649s">Mr.</a>  Gilmour? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2473.889s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2474.349s">Would</a>  you like to speak please? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2476.13s">Name</a>  and address on the record please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2480.172s">Technically,</a>  they already have the sign there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2482.674s">I'm</a>  at a sign company and he asked me to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2486.316s">I</a>  understand if he is not allowed, he is not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2492.379s">I</a>  let him know. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2496.589s">I'm</a>  sorry, could you repeat that please? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2498.311s">I</a>  say technically, I'm the sign company and he asked me to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2504.416s">He</a>  want to put a middle center because you want to show up when they have some promotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2511.743s">He</a>  don't have to put a band and put anything else, but if he's not allowed, not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2519.671s">What</a>  can I do? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2521.472s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Gilma.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2523.595s">Councilor</a>  Morell, you're the chairman.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2525.196s">I</a>  would move to vote on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2526.637s">I</a>  agree with my fellow councilors that there's no shortage of signs at this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2531.259s">It's</a>  pretty clear in our sign ordinance that movement is prohibited, which the business should be familiar with our sign ordinance at this point, considering the previous petitions for reversal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2540.923s">So</a>  I would move to vote on this tonight and I would move for a denial.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2545.545s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2546.505s">I</a>  think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, this application isn't just for a sign that has movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2551.287s">The</a>  sign is 36 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2553.351s">The</a>  ordinance calls for a sign that would be 30 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2556.453s">This</a>  sign looks like it's about anywhere between 10 to 15 feet in height. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2560.976s">And</a>  our ordinance says that signs of this nature should not exceed six feet in height. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2564.458s">So</a>  I think that this is clearly an issue where the council should not waste its time going through the exercise of futility of sending a two-way subcommittee.</p>
