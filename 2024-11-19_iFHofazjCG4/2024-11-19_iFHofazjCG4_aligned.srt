Present.

3

Councilor Marks.

4
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:02,893
Present.

5
00:00:03,113 --> 00:00:03,733
Councilor Morrell.

6
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:04,174
Present.

7
00:00:05,174 --> 00:00:07,916
President, please rise and salute the flag.

8
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:18,903
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

9
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:44,650
Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, Chapter 38, Section 18, and the Governor's March 18, 2020 order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Memphis City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

15
00:01:27,456 --> 00:01:29,960
Okay.

16
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:35,619
Motions, orders, or resolutions offered by Vice President Knight.

17
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:43,904
Be it so resolved that the Memphis City Council requests that the city administration provide an update regarding the status of contract negotiations with the clerical union staff.

18
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:44,585
Vice President Knight.

19
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:46,246
Mr. President, thank you very much.

20
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:52,810
Last week, we made inquiry into the status of the negotiations between our recreation department, building department, and the administration.

21
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,692
And this week, I'd like to ask for an update on our clerical union.

22
00:01:56,132 --> 00:02:02,236
It's my understanding that both of these bargaining units have gone without a contract for an extended period of time, and I personally don't see any reason why.

23
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:04,738
I think that they should be at the table negotiating.

24
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:06,799
If they're at a stalemate, then let the council know.

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,901
But at this point in time, Mr. President, I'm asking that we get an update.

26
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:14,785
Unfortunately, in our packets this week, you will see that the mayor did respond to last week's resolution.

27
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:19,228
And her response was, we will not comment on ongoing contract negotiations.

28
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:22,891
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that the resolution be forwarded to the administration.

29
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:29,873
with the anticipation that they see the error in their ways and provide us with the information that we need to make informed decisions moving forward into budget season.

30
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:35,134
If in fact these two collective bargaining agreements are settled, it will have a financial impact on this community.

31
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:45,117
And as the financial watchdog in this community, the Medford City Council, the body responsible for the appropriation of funds, I think it's well within our scope and authority to be informed of these decisions and what's going on.

32
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:48,418
So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.

33
00:02:49,323 --> 00:02:52,966
A motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

34
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,067
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

35
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:56,610
Councilor Behrs?

36
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,030
Yes.

37
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:58,111
Councilor Falco?

38
00:02:58,792 --> 00:02:59,032
Yes.

39
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,093
Vice President Knight?

40
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:00,614
Yes.

41
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:01,294
Councilor Marks?

42
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:01,915
Yes.

43
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:02,836
Councilor Morrell?

44
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:03,256
Yes.

45
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:04,217
Councilor Scarpelli?

46
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:04,577
Yes.

47
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:05,478
President Kerrio?

48
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:05,778
Yes.

49
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:07,220
7 in the affirmative, motion passes.

50
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:18,582
2-1-374 offered by Councilor Morrell, being so resolved that the City Council receive an update from the administration on current 40B project and applications in the city.

51
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:19,463
Councilor Morrell.

52
00:03:20,204 --> 00:03:21,264
Thank you, Mr. President.

53
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:28,250
Yeah, this is just seeking an update from the administration on the three ongoing projects, which to my understanding are still making their way through council.

54
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,491
As you know, this is a recurring item.

55
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,873
This has been placed by yourself on the agenda before.

56
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:37,217
Just seeking information and update from the administration, particularly because

57
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:43,903
These three developments are listed in the housing production plan that was delivered to us as affordable housing in the pipeline.

58
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:52,511
So I'm just seeking to understand if this is affordable housing that is actually coming through or this is actively being fought by the administration and what the update is there.

59
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:55,674
So just seeking a written update from the administration.

60
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,456
I don't know if there's anyone on the call tonight either.

61
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:14,969
I've requested to put through a resolution similar to this, but I was told that it didn't, we had this on the agenda less than 90 days.

62
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:24,139
So I did want to, if I could add to that, just if the Senate administration can also provide us with the,

63
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:40,314
with the tax revenue that is being lost right now with the lack of the 40B projects and follow up with the update on where we stand legally.

64
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:48,863
I've been told there was already a hearing today on one and didn't go too favorably for the administration.

65
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:53,707
So, which from what I've been told, I think it's going to follow suit.

66
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,349
So be interested to see.

67
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:57,230
So thank you, Mr. President.

68
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,372
Thank you, Mr. President.

69
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:01,534
I want to thank Councilor Morrell for bringing this forward.

70
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:06,438
I think most every councilor has actually had a similar resolution to this.

71
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:10,541
And yet we have not received any response from the administration regarding this.

72
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,663
And this is a major issue in our community.

73
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:20,130
We're talking about housing and we have got no information from the administration.

74
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,073
The administration wants to be transparent.

75
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:25,195
They have to be transparent about this here.

76
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:32,044
If we had these tied up in court, this is costing us, I'm sure hundreds of thousands of dollars.

77
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:50,461
So if Councilor Morrell wouldn't mind, I'd like to amend the resolution as I've amended, I think most of the other resolutions that have pertained to this matter to find out how much we have spent so far on legal costs regarding 40 Bs and where they are being charged on the budget.

78
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:57,347
And once again, I just want to thank Councilor Morrell for bringing this forward and I second the motion.

79
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:00,609
Thank you, Mr. President.

80
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,950
Thank you, Councilor Morrell and my fellow councilors.

81
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:06,153
I agree with the sentiments that everyone just echoed.

82
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:17,921
I would just also ask that we amend the paper to request that the administration give us an estimated timeline for when the legal process will be complete for the same reasons that my fellow councilors have outlined.

83
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:18,462
Thank you.

84
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:22,344
If I may, Mr. President.

85
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:25,026
Thank you.

86
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:32,703
I look at this situation with the 40B developments that are going on in this community, Mr. President, and I look at them as missed opportunities.

87
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:39,085
And we have an administration that campaigns on affordable housing and then fights tooth and nail to prevent it.

88
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:45,106
With just one of these projects, we're looking at probably close to $2.5 million in permitting fees, probably $250,000 per month in property taxes.

89
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:57,477
And it seems like it's a frivolous fight when five separate consultants, all independent of each other, say that the city's glam calculations are incorrect.

90
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,000
So I really think, Mr. President, that they should have run a friendly 40B.

91
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:15,070
We had Judy Barrett working with us, who's the renowned 40B, friendly 40B expert across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who's no longer with us for a variety of reasons, I think, that surround

92
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,392
the ongoing litigation, Mr. President.

93
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:32,105
So with that being said, I thank the councilors for bringing this up and I certainly look forward to bringing this solution, this issue to a head because we talk about what's going on in the inner belt of 95 and the need for affordable housing and the need to increase housing production.

94
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,887
We have a housing production plan.

95
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,349
These projects are mentioned in them, but where are we?

96
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:38,822
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

97
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:40,983
And if I could put it, I want to thank Councilor Morocco again.

98
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:47,244
Like Councilor Falco said, I think we've all brought this up at some point in the last year.

99
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:54,666
And again, we've gone through the housing production plan, and all we keep hearing about is affordable housing, affordable housing, affordable housing.

100
00:07:54,686 --> 00:07:57,187
And we're 670 units away from our magic number.

101
00:07:58,247 --> 00:08:04,552
Again, unfortunately, this is the only avenue we have for affordable housing in any kind of numbers.

102
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:10,356
So I don't know what the holdup is, and I support all my council's resolutions on this.

103
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:19,643
And hopefully, again, another time, this is probably the fifth or sixth resolution doing this, and we get some kind of answer.

104
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:23,766
So on the motion, Councilor Morrell, seconded by?

105
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:24,226
Second.

106
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:25,747
Seconded by Councilor Falcone.

107
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:26,768
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

108
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:32,381
as amended council bears.

109
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:32,861
Yes.

110
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:33,782
Council Falco.

111
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:34,282
Yes.

112
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:36,224
Vice President Knight.

113
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:36,804
Yes.

114
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:37,905
Council Marks.

115
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:38,725
Yes.

116
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:39,546
Council Morrell.

117
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:39,946
Yes.

118
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:41,147
Councilor Scarpelli.

119
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:41,567
Yes.

120
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:42,468
President carry yellow.

121
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:42,708
Yes.

122
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:58,868
21375 offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that long time resident business owner in the late Frank Andre be recognized for his dedication and commitment to the residents and businesses owners of Medford.

123
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:00,649
Councilor Mox.

124
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,650
Thank you, Mr. President.

125
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:09,573
It's a real honor and privilege tonight to mention the name of Frank Andre.

126
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,635
For those that do not know Frank,

127
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:18,900
Frank was an instrumental part of this community for many, many decades, Mr. President.

128
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:35,784
Frank Andrew was born in Worcester, Mass., and moved to Revere as a young boy, and then permanently located to his beloved Medford in 1936, living on Fulton Street for the next 80 years until his passing in 2016 at age 94.

129
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:46,977
Frank lived in Method with his parents, Michael and Phyllis, and siblings, Anthony, Nicholas, Francis, and Lena.

130
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:52,546
The family settled at 131 Fulton Street, a home that is still in the family today.

131
00:09:53,672 --> 00:10:04,937
A few years later, Frank met his future wife, Norma Luongo, who lived a few doors down at 105 Fulton Street, and later at 115 Fulton Street.

132
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:10,279
The couple married in 1946 and had one son, Chuck.

133
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:21,284
Frank and Norma purchased a new home at 125 Fulton Street with his grandson, Michael, and his wife, Gwen, and their two sons currently reside today.

134
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:35,899
To complete the family's occupation of the stretch of Fulton Street, Frank built a house for his parents at 137 Fulton Street in 1956, which is now occupied by his granddaughter, Carla.

135
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:41,796
Frank was involved in many businesses in Medford in the 1940s and 50s.

136
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:55,960
Among other things, he owned a bicycle rental shop, opened Frank Andre's restaurant, and then was involved in Andre's Market with his family, all located on Salem Street and Riverside Ave.

137
00:10:56,961 --> 00:11:05,424
In the early 1960s, Frank focused his attention to building when he founded the Andre Construction Company in Medford.

138
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:13,271
Andre Construction went on to build over 300 houses, with the majority built in North Meffitt.

139
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:27,016
Frank's home still dominates streets like Gaston Street, Haines Street, Mitchell Ave, Andrew Street, Saunders Street, Reeder Drive, Doonan Street, Fulton Spring Road, and many, many others.

140
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:33,659
He also owned many commercial properties in the city, primarily in Meffitt Square.

141
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:50,550
It was through his building and investing in properties that he first became interested in the Dyer Building that was formerly housed the Meffitt Theater, located at 36 Salem Street, which had fallen into disrepair and had closed in 1964.

142
00:11:53,138 --> 00:12:10,814
Frank eventually purchased the property along with the prominent local physician, Dr. Anthony Graffio from the Hackett family in 1965 with the idea of converting the building to the then novel idea of constructing office condominiums.

143
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:25,042
Things suddenly changed for the city of Meffitt, and in particular Meffitt Square and its merchants, on the night of November 1st, 1965, when a general round fire ravaged Meffitt High School.

144
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:38,556
when plans were announced a short time later to construct a new high school on Winthrop Street, Method Square had become dependent on businesses from almost 3,000 students, suddenly was facing a crisis.

145
00:12:43,462 --> 00:13:00,984
with the square facing the reality of many businesses leaving due to the high school relocation, then Mayor Jack McGlynn approached Frank and asked him to consider renovating the dilapidated theater, building and reopening it as the cornerstone of the Memphis Square community.

146
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:07,116
Frank knew nothing about the theater business, but did his investigative work.

147
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:17,300
And true to his Medford pride, and in an attempt to revitalize Medford Square, he met with Mayor Jack McGlynn and the city council and renovations began.

148
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:26,524
On August 2nd, 1967, Frank proudly opened the newly renovated and then state-of-the-art Medford Cinema.

149
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:29,705
The cinema opened to long lines,

150
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:36,690
with the first two movies being Disney's Snow White and the comedy hit Never Too Late.

151
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:46,718
In 1968, Frank opened Cinema 2 by renovating the old Colonial Hall that was located in the second floor of the building.

152
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:57,227
In 1969, the complex expanded to Memphis Cinema 1, 2, and 3, with the opening of Cinema 3 and the then converted balcony.

153
00:13:58,258 --> 00:14:09,102
Over the next few decades, it was mission accomplished for Meffitt Square as long lines of patrons waited to watch their favorite movies at Meffitt's only theater.

154
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:17,845
Hits like The Sound of Music, The Godfather, and Jaws brought thousands of people to Meffitt Square each week.

155
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:27,093
Frank became well-known in the theater circles in 1970 with his innovation of Dollar Night.

156
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:33,136
On Mondays and Tuesdays patrons could pay just $1 to see the movie of their choice.

157
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:48,542
This spawned huge crowds and also drew the attention of the Massachusetts State Police as it was not uncommon to have traffic at a standstill on Route 93 trying to get into Meffitt Square.

158
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:53,539
Local businesses thrived because of the success of the cinema.

159
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:15,492
Carol's Restaurant, Papageno's, the Pewter Pot, the Method Cafeteria, Savage's Deli, Brigham's, Baskin-Robbins, the Peking on the Mystic, the China Ocean, as well as the counters at Grant's and Woolworth's were all jam-packed before, between, and after all shows.

160
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:27,020
In addition, local merchants in the square started to stay open later and began to thrive again, enjoying the many patrons of the cinema that suddenly became newfound customers.

161
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,283
Method Square became revitalized.

162
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:40,673
Frank operated the cinema for decades until the advent of the mall-style multi-screen complexes that put an end to almost all neighborhood theaters.

163
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:48,030
Frank's other interests also included the owning of the Andre Thoroughbred Racing Stable.

164
00:15:48,871 --> 00:16:00,622
Frank was involved in local sports as well, serving as a long-time manager of the Hawks in the Nob Method Little League, as well as vice president of that league over a decade.

165
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:11,470
Frank was a staunch supporter of Meffitt High School athletics, and his biggest joy was watching his son, Chuck, and grandchildren, Michael and Carla, participate in Meffitt sports.

166
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:21,637
In fact, his son, Chuck, and his granddaughter, Carla, are the only father-daughter duo currently inducted into the Meffitt Mustang Hall of Fame.

167
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:26,398
Frank's family continues to make Meffitt their home today.

168
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:36,282
Chuck and his wife, Kathy, are both lifelong Meffitt residents, as are their grandchildren, Michael and Carla, and his two great-grandchildren, Leo and Miles.

169
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:52,055
Frank's son Chuck is the founder of Remax Andre Realty Services in Meffitt Square and continues to own and operate the Andre Chiefs, formerly the Hosmer Chiefs, Meffitt's only semi-professional baseball team.

170
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:57,877
Kyle is a teacher at Meffitt High School, while Michael is an executive at neighboring Assembly Row.

171
00:16:58,757 --> 00:17:10,086
Frank's contributions to the city run long and deep and are still evidenced today by his legacy and ongoing participation of his lifelong Medford family members.

172
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:17,813
Mr. President, I respectfully ask that we as a council vote on the motion tonight.

173
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:37,753
that a dedication and a plaque be placed in front of 36 Salem Street, which formerly housed the Meffitt Cinema, honoring and recognizing Frank Andre for his unselfish dedication to the residents and business owners of Meffitt.

174
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:44,180
Mr. President, you know, you hear this a lot, but I happen to know the Andre family.

175
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,941
I knew Frank and his wife, his lovely wife, and Chuck.

176
00:17:48,561 --> 00:18:06,987
And you couldn't meet a gentler, kinder man, would be the first, Mr. President, to extend a hand if he needed, would be the first to donate, and he did many, many times, keeping Method Sports going, Mr. President, and would be the first to step forward when this community needed.

177
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:17,321
And I think that's evident in what he did, Mr. President, during his part after that awful fire at Meffitt High School on Forest Street.

178
00:18:18,142 --> 00:18:20,025
And he was one of the driving forces.

179
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:22,047
There were other people, Mr. President,

180
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:31,038
But it's fair to say he was one of the driving forces to make the revitalization of Meffitt Square happen once again, Mr. President.

181
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:39,228
And I wish we had people like that around now, because we really could use the strong foundation, Mr. President, when it comes to

182
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:50,671
looking at the revitalization currently of Meffitt Square and the vision that was had back some 40, 50 years ago that I think would still apply now, Mr. President.

183
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:52,391
Hard work and vision.

184
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:56,292
And that's what Frank Andre and his family was all about.

185
00:18:56,732 --> 00:19:08,995
So it's with great pride that I ask that this be sent to the administration, Mr. President, and that a plaque and a dedication be held in the very near future on behalf of Frank Andre

186
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:15,137
in his commitment to the residents and business owners in Meffitt Square.

187
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:16,437
Thank you, Mr. President.

188
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,598
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

189
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:20,018
Outstanding rendition.

190
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:21,599
Councilor Scott Milley.

191
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,980
Thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this forward.

192
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:34,163
What a litany of success that the Andre family has put forth, with especially their patriarch,

193
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,123
This is why we love Medford.

194
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:48,951
I think people, it's funny that you often get confused in lifelong residents in Medford and people looking negatively at that.

195
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:51,974
And when you look at someone like the Andre family,

196
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,204
The reason why Memphis is such a great community and such a great city is families like the Andre family.

197
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:00,346
And we can never forget that.

198
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:05,010
I tell my kids all the time, you'll never know where you're going if you never know where you came from.

199
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:09,955
And it's important that people like Mr. Andre are remembered

200
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:12,510
of what they've done.

201
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:15,993
I've known the Andre family for a long time.

202
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:21,098
I was lucky enough to coach Collar and I conducted her into the Hall of Fame.

203
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:33,170
And again, what Mr. Andre passed off to his son and then passed off to their children, you see the commitment to Medford, becoming teachers.

204
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:36,554
working and volunteering for Little League.

205
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:50,027
When I was on the board in Little League, if you needed something, Frank was sitting on his stoop watching every single game like a dedicated Mustang.

206
00:20:51,969 --> 00:21:01,974
This is someone that we should find, you know, that we see a lot of names that are deserving this community along the streets, street corners and different plaques and monuments.

207
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:10,938
But when you talk about a person like Councilman Mach said, that really stepped up for his community and could have easily walked away and we didn't know where we'd be today.

208
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:24,326
So again, this is, I wholeheartedly second the motion and congratulate Council Marks for really highlighting a true Method Mustang that should be never forgotten.

209
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:24,907
So thank you.

210
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:25,987
Thank you.

211
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:26,948
Councilor Falco.

212
00:21:28,657 --> 00:21:29,338
Thank you, Mr. President.

213
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:31,441
I also want to thank Councilor Matz for bringing this forward.

214
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:40,274
As I was preparing for the meeting, I was reading through the resolution and it couldn't help but bring a smile to my face because I remember the theater as a kid.

215
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:43,799
I remember going and I actually remember seeing Jaws at that theater.

216
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:51,134
It just brought back some memories of, you know, just being a kid and walking through Method Square and doing those types of things.

217
00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:54,096
And I never knew that Mr. Andre owned the theater.

218
00:21:54,176 --> 00:22:01,421
So I just wanted to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and echo the sentiments of my colleague, Councilor Scarpelli.

219
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:06,264
The Andre family has always given back generously in time and donations.

220
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:09,166
And this is a very fitting tribute.

221
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:10,927
And I would also second the motion.

222
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:11,447
Thank you.

223
00:22:12,468 --> 00:22:12,948
Thank you.

224
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:13,769
Vice President Knight.

225
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:20,815
Maybe we can get his grandson Michael to come over from Assembly Row and get to work on Medford Square just like his grandfather did.

226
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:23,420
It'd be quite a legacy that he could leave behind if that were the case.

227
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:25,710
Thank you.

228
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,792
And again, I want to thank Councilor Marks for putting this forward.

229
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:36,420
The Andre family is synonymous with many things that meant for the generosity, the commitment, and the Mustang blue runs through their veins.

230
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,185
And as many people know, that building is currently going under, it's under renovation.

231
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,967
I will reach out to the owner of the property, who was a friend of mine.

232
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:53,852
and ask him about putting a plaque on the building similar to they did for several other people in the community on different buildings.

233
00:22:53,872 --> 00:23:00,856
So that was something I'll do tomorrow morning and along with send this to mayor for a sign in front of the building also.

234
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:06,440
On the motion, excuse me, Jane W. Jane W?

235
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:09,061
You have your hand up?

236
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:11,863
Jane W?

237
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,149
Mr. Clerk, can you unmute Jane W.?

238
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:38,240
Jane, I'm sorry, but we're not able to unmute you.

239
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:42,766
If we can, give me a second.

240
00:23:42,786 --> 00:23:44,387
Is she trying on her end, Mr. President?

241
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:47,049
Jane, can you try on your end to unmute yourself, please?

242
00:23:51,592 --> 00:23:53,493
All right.

243
00:23:54,654 --> 00:23:56,776
We have Andrew Castagnetti from East Medford.

244
00:23:57,376 --> 00:23:59,377
Mr. Castagnetti, name and address of the record, please.

245
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:05,522
It's great technology.

246
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:09,845
Can we unmute the fire tower, Mr. Castagnetti?

247
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:15,531
Hello.

248
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:20,795
Andrew Castanetti.

249
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:22,496
Thank you, Council President.

250
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:29,159
I don't know if you can hear me with all this plane noise above me in East Medford.

251
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,521
East Medford, yes, we can hear you.

252
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,642
You can hear me?

253
00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:34,943
Okay, the plane went by.

254
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:41,587
I want to commend Councilor Marks for bringing forward to commemorate

255
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:53,807
The gentleman and Dr. Graffield, for bringing, getting the cinema back into motion, from the ashes.

256
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,428
It was wonderful.

257
00:24:55,728 --> 00:25:00,232
And Councilor Marks mentioned all the beautiful businesses we had, World War Western, Grants, et cetera, et cetera.

258
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,953
He neglected only two.

259
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:11,860
One was Joe's pool room below the cafeteria on High Street and Forest, and also the small ball bowling where Harvey Van Guyde is also.

260
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:16,105
And it was great to have businesses doing some business.

261
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:19,948
However, the city, the politicians made a huge mistake.

262
00:25:20,949 --> 00:25:26,233
Back in 1970, when my wife graduated, that was the last year of the old Meffitt High School.

263
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:32,957
And unfortunately, they built the new high school and the so-called new high school in the West Meffitt Woods.

264
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:38,821
And in my opinion, it devastated the Meffitt Square economically.

265
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:41,043
And we've never, ever recovered from that.

266
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:44,641
Hopefully we all learn lessons, especially our next cities around us.

267
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:52,948
But it's wonderful that we commemorate him and have a plaque there for him because he did a lot for the city.

268
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,069
Thank you for listening.

269
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,130
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

270
00:25:56,791 --> 00:26:01,355
Okay, on the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by?

271
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:02,696
Second.

272
00:26:03,217 --> 00:26:04,778
Seconded by Councilor Scott Pele.

273
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:05,939
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

274
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,122
Councilor Peters?

275
00:26:09,322 --> 00:26:09,482
Yes.

276
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:10,555
Councilor Condoco.

277
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:10,795
Yes.

278
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:11,796
Vice President Knight.

279
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:12,756
Councilor Marks.

280
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:13,276
Yes.

281
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:14,057
Councilor Morrell.

282
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:14,437
Yes.

283
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:15,437
Councilor Scarpelli.

284
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:15,757
Yes.

285
00:26:15,797 --> 00:26:16,277
Councilor Kerrio.

286
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:16,617
Yes.

287
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:18,098
I move the affirmative, motion passes.

288
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:27,361
21376 offered by Councilor Marks being resolved in a moment of silence to be held for a long time before the rest of the spread of COVID-19.

289
00:26:28,342 --> 00:26:28,902
Councilor Marks.

290
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:32,243
Thank you, Mr. President.

291
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,546
I rise today for a very sad news, Mr. President.

292
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:48,050
Fred Papa Calangeli, known as Papa, passed recently, Mr. President.

293
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:54,494
Longtime Methodist resident, beloved husband of Joan Domenico Calangeli.

294
00:26:55,315 --> 00:27:03,939
And he was a family first gentleman, always with his grandkids, always with his wife, Mr. President, and his own kids.

295
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,021
He was a very active member of the St.

296
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:08,342
Joseph community.

297
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:14,718
a longtime member of the Sons of Italy and the Elks, and he served in the Korean War.

298
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:16,819
That's a mouthful, Mr. President.

299
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,343
He lived many lifetimes, and he was a man of great stature.

300
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:30,330
He owned and operated his own company as well, construction, and he specialized in masonry and underground pools.

301
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:34,594
He was a man that was always on the move, was always willing to help out.

302
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:36,135
If you needed something done,

303
00:27:36,544 --> 00:27:44,709
If you needed your cement stairs fixed over, it'd be the first thing you'd do with this little barrel and a cement equipment to help out Mr. President.

304
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:47,391
Never looking for anything, but to help you out.

305
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:49,992
That was the type of person he is, Mr. President.

306
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:52,154
And he will be sorely missed.

307
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:58,838
And I would ask that we dedicate this meeting in the name of Fred Papa Colangeli, Mr. President.

308
00:27:58,858 --> 00:27:59,198
Thank you.

309
00:27:59,438 --> 00:27:59,839
Thank you.

310
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,342
On the motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by Vice President Knight.

311
00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:07,196
The question is called the road.

312
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:12,739
Yes.

313
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:12,839
Yes.

314
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:13,119
Yes.

315
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:13,520
Yes.

316
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:13,960
Yes.

317
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:47,735
21377 offered by Councilor Falco will be resolved at DCI.

318
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:52,736
Trim the grass at the corner of Webster Street and Fountain Street in the interest of public safety.

319
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:53,817
Councilor Falco.

320
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:54,817
Thank you, Mr. President.

321
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:57,898
I bring this resolution again tonight.

322
00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:00,098
I feel like I bring this at least once a year.

323
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:07,280
And the grass at the corner of Webster Street and Fountain Street, there's a kind of like a median strip there.

324
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,402
And as you come out, if you take a left, you can see that the grass is getting really high.

325
00:29:12,442 --> 00:29:13,402
It's probably over a foot now.

326
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:17,671
And we can just have someone from the administration, please contact the DCR.

327
00:29:18,272 --> 00:29:24,856
And if we can have that mode in the interest of public safety, it's a problem that needs to be addressed.

328
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,999
We should be addressing these things sooner than later.

329
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,660
And we need to take pride in our community.

330
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,703
We shouldn't be letting the grass like this get out of control.

331
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:40,267
So if we could have someone from the administration contact DCR to have this cut as soon as possible.

332
00:29:40,808 --> 00:29:49,230
Councilor Falco, if you wouldn't mind amending that to doing the whole circle on both sides, not just Webster Street, all four of those corners are a mess.

333
00:29:50,410 --> 00:30:00,092
So if you wouldn't mind adding that as an amendment to clean the whole rotary on both sides of the highway, because it's pretty high all around that.

334
00:30:00,252 --> 00:30:03,153
Do you mean the rotary at- On the Webster Street?

335
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:11,195
So Webster Street and Fountain is like- On the other side of the highway, the grass is pretty tall over there and that whole rotary is a mess too.

336
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:11,736
Perfect.

337
00:30:11,996 --> 00:30:14,337
That's fine, I'm open to the amendment, sir, thank you.

338
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:15,538
Thank you.

339
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:16,119
Councilor Max.

340
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:17,399
Thank you, Mr. President.

341
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:23,143
I wanna thank Councilor Falco for putting this on and he consistently brings it up every year.

342
00:30:24,504 --> 00:30:32,870
A few weeks ago, I think we voted unanimously by this council to have DCI look at all the state areas in the community to pick up trash.

343
00:30:33,972 --> 00:30:45,062
I think we're at a point right now, Mr. President, we have so many roads in this community that involve participation from a state agency, which is DCR, that I think we have to bring them in.

344
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:46,383
I really do.

345
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:53,289
Today, I happened to take a walk in Wellington Circle across from Cappy's, and I wasn't going into the liquor store.

346
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,612
I probably should have gone into the liquor store, but I wasn't going into the liquor store.

347
00:30:57,032 --> 00:30:58,614
And when I tell you, Mr. President,

348
00:30:59,112 --> 00:31:00,192
really take a ride by.

349
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:02,473
It is so filthy and dirty.

350
00:31:02,533 --> 00:31:04,554
Think about everyone coming through Wellington.

351
00:31:04,914 --> 00:31:11,216
It's a disgrace with the trash and the objects that are just left out there and the overgrown grass.

352
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,836
It really is a disgrace.

353
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,197
And it's everywhere.

354
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:24,407
that these state roads are, I hate to say it, that we're not seeing a consistent pickup and cutting and mowing and so forth of DCI.

355
00:31:24,728 --> 00:31:29,533
So I would ask respectfully, Mr. President, that we ask them to appear before the Memphis City Council.

356
00:31:30,709 --> 00:31:34,831
probably be nice next week because the nice weather's here.

357
00:31:35,831 --> 00:31:56,480
Come before the Memphis City Council and be able to address what is the schedule for grass clipping, for pickup, and let them explain in every section, as Councilor Falco mentioned, you mentioned, I know Councilor Scarpelli, everyone behind this rail has mentioned, Mr. President, and have them explain what is the process and what is the schedule that they're going by.

358
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:58,341
Thank you, Mr. President.

359
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:01,238
Thank you.

360
00:32:01,998 --> 00:32:03,220
On the motion by.

361
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:05,442
I'm sorry, God helps the best.

362
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:06,363
Thank you, Mr. President.

363
00:32:06,543 --> 00:32:11,328
I know it's a lot of mirrors.

364
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:19,456
I would just ask that we also invite mascot because I believe Webster fountain and the Salem Street Rotary are dot not DCR.

365
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:21,148
Um, and it's a problem.

366
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:23,610
The grass is a problem, but the trash is a problem too.

367
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,493
And I don't even think those two state coordinate agencies are coordinating either.

368
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:31,936
So it might be good to have everybody in the room, um, to, to try to iron this out.

369
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,278
I live on a state road and it's a big problem.

370
00:32:34,438 --> 00:32:34,758
Thank you.

371
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:43,305
Also because these state agencies sometimes like to thumb their nose at local officials.

372
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:46,968
If we can invite a state delegation as well.

373
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:57,780
Okay, on the motion by Councilor Falco.

374
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:05,185
Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly as amended by President Caravaglia, as amended by Councilor Marks, and as amended by Councilor Beers.

375
00:33:06,646 --> 00:33:07,987
And then Councilor Marks again.

376
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:09,588
Did I get them all?

377
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,509
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

378
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:16,312
Councilor Beers.

379
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:16,692
Yes.

380
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,053
Councilor Falco.

381
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:18,633
Yes.

382
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:19,674
Vice President Knight.

383
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:20,134
Yes.

384
00:33:20,654 --> 00:33:21,195
Councilor Marks.

385
00:33:21,255 --> 00:33:21,535
Yes.

386
00:33:21,963 --> 00:33:22,483
Councilor Morrell?

387
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:22,864
Yes.

388
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:23,864
Councilor Scarpelli?

389
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:24,225
Yes.

390
00:33:24,405 --> 00:33:25,185
President Kerrio?

391
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:25,926
Yes.

392
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:27,787
Seven affirmative motion passes.

393
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:38,575
21378 offered by Councilor Falco being resolved that the administration provide an update with regards to the curbing that surrounds the McGlynn School Complex and the condition of Freedom Way.

394
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:39,536
Councilor Falco.

395
00:33:39,676 --> 00:33:40,417
Thank you, Mr. President.

396
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:48,903
I was notified by a resident last week about the condition of the curbing down at the Freedom Way and McGlynn School.

397
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:53,929
And they sent me a number of photos, I took a drive down by myself as well just to take a look.

398
00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:03,337
And I know back a few years ago, I believe the prior administration had started a project with regard to replacing the curbing at the McGlynn School and I believe

399
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:06,300
It might be finished, it might be partway finished.

400
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:15,342
I know that there is extra curbing that's on the side of the road, but there's still plenty of curbing around the school that some of it's completely obliterated.

401
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:17,022
It looks like it's just dust on the ground.

402
00:34:17,043 --> 00:34:23,244
So I just wanted to get some sort of an update from the administration as to when that's going to be finished or if it's going to be finished.

403
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:25,945
It doesn't look like there's enough curbing to finish the job.

404
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:30,230
but it does need to be addressed and the company needs to be replaced.

405
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,953
If someone comes from outside of the city and they see our schools like this, it's a disgrace.

406
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:39,836
It doesn't say much about what we're doing about our city and how we're treating our buildings.

407
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:45,080
We need to make sure we're safeguarding our buildings and our school properties for the future generations of the city.

408
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,281
And this is a problem that needs to be addressed.

409
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:50,964
So at this point, I'd just like to move approval.

410
00:34:51,044 --> 00:34:51,384
Thank you.

411
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:54,166
Mr. President.

412
00:34:56,615 --> 00:34:57,655
Thank you.

413
00:34:57,775 --> 00:35:00,456
I just want to second what Councilor Falco said here.

414
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:06,457
I mean, the condition of the roadway itself and the curbing, and in many cases, the sidewalks is a disaster.

415
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:13,818
I was down there three weeks ago at the McGlynn School, and it's a safety hazard in addition to being a shame on the condition itself.

416
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:21,860
I can remember two years ago, a meeting at some point where someone was complaining about the cost of granite curbing.

417
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,860
And I think this speaks to the larger issue

418
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:33,146
that I think we've all been talking about for a long time, which is we need to find a way to make sure that our infrastructure is fully maintained on a reasonable schedule.

419
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:38,629
Councilor Marks was talking about this in regards to road repair and replacement.

420
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:41,110
700 roads, we're doing six every certain number of years.

421
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:45,433
I mean, it's a serious problem and we need more than status quo plans.

422
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:53,497
So I'm really hopeful that someone in the administration will take this seriously and address this problem because someone could get hurt.

423
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:54,197
Thank you.

424
00:35:57,398 --> 00:35:57,979
Mr. President.

425
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:04,810
Thank you, Mr. President and my two colleagues Council beers and Council Falco, I think hit the nail on the head.

426
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:08,616
I just would say, Mr. President, this has been an ongoing issue.

427
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:11,842
And if we recall, I think it was last year, maybe the year prior.

428
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:18,363
that we had faculty members, we had parents come up to this very Method City Council.

429
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:25,527
And we had a teacher, Mrs. Castanetti, that called to light a number of the potholes and curbing.

430
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:35,753
And then shortly after that, Mr. President, she actually tripped and fell on a pothole in the square and did some serious damage to herself, Mr. President.

431
00:36:36,013 --> 00:36:42,057
And these are very serious incidences in the community and deserve the utmost attention.

432
00:36:42,518 --> 00:36:48,700
So I would ask that we get a report back immediately as Councilor Falco and Councilor Beers alluded to.

433
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:58,883
So I'll call the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Vice-President Knight.

434
00:36:58,903 --> 00:36:59,883
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

435
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:03,564
Councilor Marks, you want that?

436
00:37:03,584 --> 00:37:05,685
No, no, with Councilor Falco's service.

437
00:37:08,986 --> 00:37:09,766
Vice-President Knight seconded.

438
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:13,812
Councilor Behrs.

439
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:14,493
Yes.

440
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:15,613
Councilor Fevella.

441
00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:16,694
Vice President Knight.

442
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:17,355
Yes.

443
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:17,975
Councilor Marks.

444
00:37:18,295 --> 00:37:18,615
Yes.

445
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:19,256
Councilor Morrell.

446
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:19,816
Yes.

447
00:37:20,276 --> 00:37:20,977
Councilor Scarpelli.

448
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:21,357
Yes.

449
00:37:21,497 --> 00:37:22,198
President Kerrio.

450
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:24,019
Yes, I'm in affirmative motion passes.

451
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:29,542
Petitions, presentations of the matter.

452
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:38,688
21379 petition to reverse sign denial by Gilmar De Silva for Prestige Car Wash 277 Middlesex Ave, Medford.

453
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:42,150
Reason for denial, movement not permitted.

454
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:46,235
Councilor Morrell is the chairman of the sign committee.

455
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:48,156
Councilor Morrell.

456
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:51,638
I don't, I know this came before us.

457
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:55,160
I don't think we actually, if I'm wrong, I don't think we had a meeting on this one specifically.

458
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:03,404
I know this came before us, the multiple awnings, but I do not believe that this made it through our committee for this LED message center.

459
00:38:04,645 --> 00:38:07,586
If we can, Mr. President, point of information.

460
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:10,188
I concur with Councilor Morrell.

461
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,605
I think what we'll do tonight is reference to send this to the subcommittee on signs.

462
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:23,570
I know we've already met on this with the number of signs we've already allowed.

463
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:29,094
So I'm really not in favor of really supporting it with all these lights.

464
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:31,176
I don't know if the council would want to vote on it.

465
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:35,600
If you'd rather send it to subcommittee to get more in depth, I'll support that too.

466
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,502
But that's normally the course of action.

467
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:39,022
So thank you.

468
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:46,171
I mean, I'm happy to vote on it tonight, unless Councilor Marks is also on the subject.

469
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,012
Mr. President, if I could.

470
00:38:48,313 --> 00:38:53,956
Mr. President, according to our sign ordinance, we don't allow movement on signage.

471
00:38:54,377 --> 00:39:00,641
However, this council over the years, at least as long as I've been on, we have allowed a few signs here and there.

472
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:09,947
And for extenuating circumstances, if you have a tough location, if the visibility is difficult, this is not one of them, Mr. President.

473
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:19,672
And if you drive by, you know, it's great that they give out free vacuums in there, but it looks like it is 45 octopus around the building.

474
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:21,333
You got all these new signs.

475
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:23,594
The awnings haven't even gone up.

476
00:39:23,974 --> 00:39:30,158
I don't know what else they want at that particular location, but I do not support movement, Mr. President.

477
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:38,803
So if, you know, I mean, we can have a subcommittee meeting, but I will not be supporting this based on the fact that I do not support

478
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:46,071
movement at this location, because I don't see any extenuating circumstance for that location, Mr. President, Mr. President.

479
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:48,292
Thank you.

480
00:39:48,612 --> 00:40:01,720
And again, I think the extenuating circumstances that we discussed with the sign movement had to do a lot with churches and showing schedules for Christians at different locations.

481
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,362
I think other than that, on this

482
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:14,799
I think the Citizens or the Century Bank that's on 93, that really doesn't really hit any of our neighbors.

483
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:19,622
But again, I'm prepared to vote.

484
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:24,124
I don't think that this falls in any need whatsoever.

485
00:40:24,704 --> 00:40:27,285
Everybody knows that there is a car wash there.

486
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:32,508
Everybody knows that there's free vacuuming.

487
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,389
I know we've already approved

488
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:37,233
the signage and the awnings that go all the way around it.

489
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:46,740
So, you know, as one resident who's also a customer, I can't see what else you want to put there.

490
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,285
I think everybody and their cousins know that that location's there and what it's offered.

491
00:40:53,305 --> 00:40:55,727
So I'm ready to vote and denial myself.

492
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:56,247
So thank you.

493
00:40:56,548 --> 00:40:58,209
Councilor Miss.

494
00:40:58,509 --> 00:41:00,371
Councilor Scarpelli just took the words out of my mouth.

495
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:02,973
If you're driving down Middlesex Avenue, you know this car wash is there.

496
00:41:03,824 --> 00:41:09,307
unless the committee wants to send it to subcommittee, I would be comfortable voting to deny the reversal tonight.

497
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:10,267
Thank you.

498
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:12,629
And we have Mr. Gilmour on the call.

499
00:41:12,649 --> 00:41:13,169
Mr. Gilmour?

500
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:14,129
Yes.

501
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:16,090
Would you like to speak please?

502
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,251
Name and address on the record please.

503
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:22,654
Technically, they already have the sign there.

504
00:41:22,674 --> 00:41:26,296
I'm at a sign company and he asked me to apply.

505
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:31,678
I understand if he is not allowed, he is not allowed.

506
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:32,979
I let him know.

507
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:37,570
I'm sorry, could you repeat that please?

508
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:44,396
I say technically, I'm the sign company and he asked me to apply.

509
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:51,723
He want to put a middle center because you want to show up when they have some promotion.

510
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:58,389
He don't have to put a band and put anything else, but if he's not allowed, not allowed.

511
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:00,231
What can I do?

512
00:42:01,472 --> 00:42:02,153
Thank you, Mr. Gilma.

513
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:04,736
Councilor Morrell, you're the chairman.

514
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:06,457
I would move to vote on this tonight.

515
00:42:06,637 --> 00:42:11,219
I agree with my fellow councilors that there's no shortage of signs at this location.

516
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:20,903
It's pretty clear in our sign ordinance that movement is prohibited, which the business should be familiar with our sign ordinance at this point, considering the previous petitions for reversal.

517
00:42:20,923 --> 00:42:24,324
So I would move to vote on this tonight and I would move for a denial.

518
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:26,225
Vice President Knight.

519
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:30,567
I think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, this application isn't just for a sign that has movement.

520
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:32,228
The sign is 36 square feet.

521
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,612
The ordinance calls for a sign that would be 30 square feet.

522
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:40,295
This sign looks like it's about anywhere between 10 to 15 feet in height.

523
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:44,037
And our ordinance says that signs of this nature should not exceed six feet in height.

524
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:51,962
So I think that this is clearly an issue where the council should not waste its time going through the exercise of futility of sending a two-way subcommittee.

525
00:42:52,462 --> 00:42:52,803
Thank you.

526
00:42:53,223 --> 00:43:00,467
So on the motion by Councilor Morrell to deny the permits, seconded by- Seconded.

527
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:01,968
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

528
00:43:02,472 --> 00:43:03,632
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

529
00:43:06,653 --> 00:43:10,993
Mr. President, I just want to clarify that a vote, a yes vote is to deny?

530
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:11,574
That is correct.

531
00:43:12,194 --> 00:43:12,514
Thank you.

532
00:43:14,454 --> 00:43:15,094
Councilor Behrs?

533
00:43:15,254 --> 00:43:15,514
Yes.

534
00:43:16,434 --> 00:43:17,075
Councilor Falcon?

535
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:17,375
Yes.

536
00:43:17,655 --> 00:43:18,335
Vice President Knight?

537
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:18,715
Yes.

538
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:19,495
Councilor Marks?

539
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:19,975
Yes.

540
00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:20,795
Councilor Morrell?

541
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:21,135
Yes.

542
00:43:21,355 --> 00:43:22,115
Councilor Scarpelli?

543
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:22,355
Yes.

544
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,316
President Carabiniello?

545
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:23,756
Yes.

546
00:43:23,856 --> 00:43:28,136
Assembly to the permit of the signed motion is for denial.

547
00:43:29,637 --> 00:43:30,437
Reports of committees.

548
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:37,193
to get a paper in suspension from Vice President Knight.

549
00:43:37,834 --> 00:43:42,837
We have one paper under suspension.

550
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:46,259
Motion to take papers from the hand of the clerk.

551
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,583
On the motion by Councilor Beers, a second by Vice President Knight to take papers under suspension.

552
00:43:55,144 --> 00:43:56,385
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

553
00:43:58,866 --> 00:43:59,406
Councilor Beers.

554
00:43:59,507 --> 00:43:59,747
Yes.

555
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:00,867
Councilor Fevella.

556
00:44:00,927 --> 00:44:01,147
Yes.

557
00:44:01,328 --> 00:44:01,968
Vice President Knight.

558
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:03,176
Councilor Marks?

559
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:03,557
Yes.

560
00:44:03,837 --> 00:44:04,417
Councilor Morrell?

561
00:44:04,577 --> 00:44:04,797
Yes.

562
00:44:05,038 --> 00:44:05,758
Councilor Scarpelli?

563
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:06,138
Yes.

564
00:44:06,218 --> 00:44:07,039
President Kiriboy?

565
00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:07,499
Yes.

566
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:17,706
Offered by Vice President Knight, be it so resolved that the Memphis City Council commend Armstrong Gaming on their ongoing contributions to the city of Memphis.

567
00:44:17,926 --> 00:44:24,770
Be it further resolved that the Memphis City Council recognize May 16th through the 22nd as EMS Awards Week.

568
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:25,611
Vice President Knight.

569
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:27,552
Mr. President, thank you very much.

570
00:44:27,812 --> 00:44:31,995
As noted in the resolution, May 16th through the 22nd is EMS Awards Week.

571
00:44:32,557 --> 00:44:36,280
And our friends at Armstrong Ambulance have been a great partner here in the city of Metro.

572
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:51,250
From the amount of work that they do in community service, reaching out volunteerism, training everybody in CPR, the IEDs that they've, I mean, the IEDs that they've put out at local hockey rinks and parks and the like, Mr. President, Armstrong's just a great partner.

573
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:53,872
And this week is EMS Awards Week.

574
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:57,435
And today there's a celebration actually in Worcester, Massachusetts.

575
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,156
It's called the Convoy of Champions.

576
00:44:59,895 --> 00:45:10,581
where they're going to be having a small parade and some MedFlight helicopters driving around to celebrate and highlight the work that our EMS professionals do in this community and communities across not only Massachusetts, but the state.

577
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:18,205
This event is established by the Massachusetts Ambulance Association in coordination with its national partner.

578
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:27,230
And Mr. President, if we look back, and we remember just a few years ago, this council congratulated Sean Main from Armstrong Ambulance for receiving the Star of Life Award

579
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:37,806
And this celebration that's going on this week is where the Massachusetts Ambulance Association will award the Stars of Life.

580
00:45:37,826 --> 00:45:42,089
Two local individuals are receiving them, a gentleman from Ireland and a gentleman from Saugus this year.

581
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:44,610
No one from Medford isn't going to be a recipient this year.

582
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:49,133
However, I think it's important to point out and highlight the good work that Armstrong Ambulance does.

583
00:45:49,153 --> 00:45:53,475
They go above and beyond the call of duty, Mr. President, to be a partner in this community and a part of this community.

584
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,357
And with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

585
00:45:57,423 --> 00:45:58,864
Councilor Scarpelli.

586
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:01,425
Thank you, Council President.

587
00:46:01,445 --> 00:46:02,166
Thanks, Councilman.

588
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:05,588
It's funny that you bring this up.

589
00:46:05,768 --> 00:46:19,256
I think that my mom is going through some medical issues, and for a patient, they don't know who I am.

590
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:26,541
My sister, Lisa, whose last name is Sharae, has been working with the Armstrong Ambulance, and the professionalism and the caring

591
00:46:27,303 --> 00:46:36,808
and the effort they provided for my family to make sure my mother is comfortable and has the transportation needed.

592
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:47,212
And one thing we realized, how difficult it is for the common person to try to get in touch with healthcare organizations to make sure you can take care of your family members.

593
00:46:47,753 --> 00:46:52,755
And the assistance that was provided by Armstrong and people in their office was amazing.

594
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:56,797
And it's not because of who I am, they don't know who I am.

595
00:46:57,475 --> 00:47:12,683
Um, but, and I'm sure that they've done this across the community and, um, you know, I'm glad that council and I brought this up because when you see that type of care and that type of specialism, you know, you want to, you want to scream on the rooftop and say, Hey, you need a pat on the back.

596
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,285
So this is, I'm glad he put this forward.

597
00:47:15,305 --> 00:47:23,649
So there's a forum that I can say, thank you as, um, you know, as a relative that, uh, that they've taken care of and,

598
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:26,114
I applaud what they've done.

599
00:47:26,154 --> 00:47:43,984
And again, it's another organization that during through the whole pandemic, they didn't take a day off, they were first person through the door and making sure that our citizens were taken care of and transported to local hospitals to make sure they they live a healthy life.

600
00:47:44,024 --> 00:47:45,465
So I applaud them.

601
00:47:46,145 --> 00:47:49,948
And thank you, Mr. President.

602
00:47:50,028 --> 00:47:51,108
And I really appreciate that.

603
00:47:51,148 --> 00:47:52,249
And I bring this up as well.

604
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:56,860
You know, every day, EMS professionals are saving lives in this community.

605
00:47:57,921 --> 00:48:12,568
And I think we've asked so much of them, especially over the past 15 months, that this is really the least we can do to thank them, not just for their volunteers and their professionalism, but for their sacrifices that they've made to keep us all safe and healthy.

606
00:48:12,748 --> 00:48:14,329
So I support this resolution.

607
00:48:14,649 --> 00:48:15,050
Thank you.

608
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:21,013
And I want to thank Council Member Knight for bringing this forward again, during this difficult time.

609
00:48:21,713 --> 00:48:27,977
Armstrong has been volunteering at the vaccination clinics, going to people's homes to vaccinate them.

610
00:48:28,017 --> 00:48:33,041
And again, they've been a good partner for the city for many, many years.

611
00:48:33,861 --> 00:48:35,623
I'll support this resolution also.

612
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,605
So, Councilor Falco.

613
00:48:39,686 --> 00:48:42,127
Yes, thank you, Councilor, for bringing this forward.

614
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:44,949
And I would echo the sentiments of my colleagues as well.

615
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,892
Cataldo has been a great, great partner.

616
00:48:49,272 --> 00:48:49,552
Armstrong.

617
00:48:51,215 --> 00:48:52,056
I'm sorry, I apologize.

618
00:48:52,236 --> 00:48:53,556
I'm trying to ignore it.

619
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,317
It's funny, someone asked me all the time.

620
00:48:56,337 --> 00:49:00,419
They've been a great partner.

621
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:05,061
Sean's done a lot of hard work there, and we thank them for all their hard work.

622
00:49:05,361 --> 00:49:09,063
Like you mentioned earlier, we talk to Marion every week with the COVID update.

623
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:15,966
They're helping out, going to give seniors the vaccinations, and they're doing a great job.

624
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,047
They've been a great partner, and I'd like to say thank you.

625
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:23,064
Thank you, so on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

Councilor Morrell?

636
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:33,529
Yes.

637
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:34,590

Reports of committees, 21033, May 12th, 2021.

643
00:49:41,053 --> 00:49:41,973
Committee, this was

644
00:49:46,088 --> 00:49:52,351
in regards to the report of the parking commission that we talked about last week.

645
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:57,074
Council Member Lozanda, would you like to give a little brief?

646
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:02,917
Sure, it was a highlight of the report, which had several charges from the mayor.

647
00:50:02,957 --> 00:50:14,903
We discussed a lot of policy, policy suggestions, some of which really conversation hinged on just simple enforcement of laws or statutes that are already on the books.

648
00:50:15,582 --> 00:50:31,465
And we also explored what it might look like for it to take things in house, as well as kind of another, several common issues which are mentioned in the report and we're waiting to see what the administration does in it and seeing also what, how we can act on this as soon as possible and not leave it as just a report.

649
00:50:32,145 --> 00:50:33,725
Thank you Councilor Morrell.

650
00:50:33,745 --> 00:50:38,706
So on the motion by Councilor Morrell, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Scarpa and Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

651
00:50:41,006 --> 00:50:41,546
Councilor Behrs.

652

Yes.

653
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:43,167
Councilor Fevella.

654
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:43,467
Yes.

655
00:50:44,939 --> 00:50:45,479
Councilor Marks?

656
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,060
Yes.

657
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,760
Councilor Morrell?

658
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:47,121
Yes.

659
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:47,941
Councilor Scarpelli?

660
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:48,041
Yes.

661
00:50:48,562 --> 00:50:49,262
President Caravaglia?

662
00:50:49,323 --> 00:50:52,485
Yes, seven affirmative, motion passes.

663
00:50:52,505 --> 00:50:55,147
2-0-5-6-8, May 13th, 2020, Committee of Whole Report.

664
00:50:55,407 --> 00:51:10,820
This committee, this is the ongoing zoning report with Attorney Brabowski, which will be having another meeting, hopefully the last one before we finish this up, which will be in two weeks.

665
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:14,123
And again, so on the motion.

666
00:51:15,638 --> 00:51:25,560
comes to this, Mr. President, if I may, I just really do encourage residents to take a look at the recordings of the meetings we've held, attend our next meeting, we put a lot of work into this.

667
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,240
And you know, the process is out there.

668
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:33,681
And I'm actually echoing Councilor Marks on a recent comment on another committee report, just to see the work that we've done.

669
00:51:33,701 --> 00:51:34,641
And it is out there.

670
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:37,642
So if you haven't taken a look, it's worth a worth a watch.

671
00:51:38,202 --> 00:51:41,563
This is something that was started on the on the car on the President Falco.

672
00:51:42,303 --> 00:51:43,583
And hopefully,

673
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:49,109
You'll go to the next step before our summer, summer reset.

674
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:55,353
So again, thank Councilor Falco for starting this and hopefully we'll get this done in the fashion.

675
00:51:56,473 --> 00:51:57,134
Chair with motion.

676
00:51:57,834 --> 00:51:58,334
Move approval.

677
00:51:58,975 --> 00:52:02,797
The motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Vice President Knight.

678
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:04,257
Please call the roll.

679
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:07,099
Councilor Behrs.

680
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:07,479
Yes.

681
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:08,259
Councilor Falco.

682
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,520
Yes.

683
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,320
Vice President Knight.

684
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:09,700
Yes.

685
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,301
Councilor Marks.

686
00:52:10,481 --> 00:52:10,861
Yes.

687
00:52:11,621 --> 00:52:11,821
Yes.

688
00:52:12,802 --> 00:52:12,982
Yes.

689
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:15,573
Yes, 70 in the affirmative.

690
00:52:15,993 --> 00:52:16,814
Motion passes.

691
00:52:17,274 --> 00:52:18,495
Public participation.

692
00:52:19,356 --> 00:52:23,559
Joseph A. Biglioni, 446 Charles Street, Malden Mass, 02148.

693
00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:28,002
Mr. Biglioni, name and address of the record, please.

694
00:52:28,522 --> 00:52:31,784
Joe Viglione, 446 Charles Street, Malden Mass, 02148.

695
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:43,413
Mr. President, Mr. Biglioni, part of this you spoke on two weeks ago, cannot come back for 90 days, from the first part,

696
00:52:45,988 --> 00:52:50,691
And on the second part, it does not pertain to city business, and I am ruling it out of order.

697
00:52:51,011 --> 00:52:53,753
I strenuously disagree, because I didn't write the first petition.

698
00:52:53,813 --> 00:52:54,794
I'm ruling it out of order.

699
00:52:55,234 --> 00:52:56,735
I want to talk about political speech.

700
00:52:56,775 --> 00:52:58,616
We are ruling it out of order.

701
00:52:58,636 --> 00:53:00,877
You're retaliating against the Boston Criminal Court.

702
00:53:01,698 --> 00:53:05,300
And this man and the bank is public speech.

703
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,742
Could you please shut up the gentleman's microphone, please?

704
00:53:08,902 --> 00:53:09,723
Thank you, Mr. Bignoni.

705
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:10,964
Thank you.

706
00:53:11,924 --> 00:53:12,925
Again, thank you.

707
00:53:15,188 --> 00:53:15,448
Yes.

708
00:53:17,629 --> 00:53:18,249
Have a good day.

709
00:53:21,811 --> 00:53:22,692
Have a good day.

710
00:53:22,752 --> 00:53:23,072
Thank you.

711
00:53:24,313 --> 00:53:33,518
Say whatever you want.

712
00:53:33,538 --> 00:53:38,020
Does anyone that we have, does anyone want to speak on the public participation?

713
00:53:39,941 --> 00:53:40,882
Public participation.

714
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:46,431
Good evening.

715
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:47,532
Let me address the record, please.

716
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:49,073
Can I speak on any topic?

717
00:53:50,153 --> 00:53:50,994
I can't get you.

718
00:53:51,454 --> 00:53:54,055
Can I speak on any topic?

719
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:54,295
Yes.

720
00:53:54,736 --> 00:53:54,976
Okay.

721
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:56,617
I'd like to speak if I may.

722
00:53:57,437 --> 00:53:58,198
My name is Jean.

723
00:53:58,358 --> 00:53:59,838
I live at 35 Paris Street.

724
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:08,863
I was watching from home and I came in because you were talking about 40 B developments and the housing production plan.

725
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:15,567
And I wanted to come for you tonight to just put a fine point on a few things that you all were speaking about.

726
00:54:16,555 --> 00:54:25,078
The first, that the 40B projects are on hold and causing tax revenue losses is inaccurate.

727
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:37,183
We are in court because there is a disagreement on the calculation for GLAM and whether or not we qualify for safe harbor.

728
00:54:37,904 --> 00:54:46,167
And we are in court because currently the Baker administration appointees are declining all safe harbor applications.

729
00:54:46,927 --> 00:54:48,207
That's the first point I want to make.

730
00:54:48,868 --> 00:55:04,493
The second point I want to make is that the 40 bees that I mentioned in the housing production plan are referenced as being 100% counted as government algorithm affordable.

731
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:14,237
They are not 100% affordable, by no means are not truly affordable by what the majority of Medford residents can afford.

732
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:20,017
the units that are putting there that are affordable will either be 20 or 25%.

733
00:55:21,678 --> 00:55:36,122
So please, let's not walk away from today's conversation with the impression that we're declining 40 Bs that are 100% affordable opportunities for the residents of Medford and the greater area that we live in.

734
00:55:37,443 --> 00:55:42,004
I just wanna put a fine point on that because there seems to be

735
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:49,655
that people speak about 4DBs with a level of expertise that isn't really present.

736
00:55:50,195 --> 00:56:04,018
And it's important that we understand the complexities of 4DB and how they impact development and how they impact potential affordability because this is an extremely nuanced topic.

737
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:11,820
It's a political hot topic and it's a lot of discussion is underway about the right approaches

738
00:56:12,357 --> 00:56:27,761
to reach truly affordable solutions that target what the average person can, under a normal salary range, be able to afford to occupy, buy, rent, what have you.

739
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:37,584
So please, I'd just like to make sure that we're not walking away having our residents think that if these 40 Bs are built, they'll be 100% affordable and there'll be housing that everybody can.

740
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:39,065
Thank you for your time.

741
00:56:50,098 --> 00:56:57,140
Good evening, David McKillop 94 Rockland Road I just wanted to make mention of a couple of things that we spoke about earlier, you spoke about earlier tonight.

742
00:56:58,561 --> 00:57:05,263
Just suggestions, the first suggestion is, even if it's doable Mr President, if we are having issues with the state.

743
00:57:06,502 --> 00:57:08,063
making sure that their roads are clean.

744
00:57:08,203 --> 00:57:12,466
Is it possible that we could actually take the step to actually do it ourselves and charge the state?

745
00:57:13,026 --> 00:57:14,147
Is this something that can be done?

746
00:57:14,187 --> 00:57:18,449
Because why should the city be penalized for their ineffectiveness?

747
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,911
Why can't we just get it done and then charge them?

748
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:27,054
That's something that I think that we should look at and forcibly make that happen.

749
00:57:27,734 --> 00:57:29,675
On that topic, Vice President Knight.

750
00:57:29,715 --> 00:57:34,678
It's not uncommon that the city and the state enter into what's called maintenance agreements.

751
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:46,884
Sleepy Hollow being a perfect example of the Sleepy Hollow stretch along Route 16, leading up to the continent shells underneath the maintenance agreement, so the city methods responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of that area but they really have no control and direction.

752
00:57:47,805 --> 00:57:48,285
Other than that.

753
00:57:49,005 --> 00:57:50,546
So these maintenance agreements to exist.

754
00:57:52,703 --> 00:58:05,166
do we have the ability to stretch our already understaffed and overstretched DPW this much further to start taking on more properties when we quite frankly are doing a bad job handling the properties that we have right now?

755
00:58:06,271 --> 00:58:09,872
Well, that becomes an actual administrative and budget issue.

756
00:58:09,892 --> 00:58:11,052
And that's a totally different thing.

757
00:58:11,092 --> 00:58:16,873
But speaking about budget issues, we're talking about schools and how their maintenance issues are a huge issue.

758
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:19,393
And they've been a continual issue for quite some time.

759
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:20,473
And there's no denying that.

760
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:25,894
In fact, when the McGlynn was built, there was supposed to be money put aside for maintenance.

761
00:58:25,974 --> 00:58:29,075
And that obviously went into the general fund from what I understand.

762
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:35,076
Are we going to hold the administrative accountable for line items to get that maintenance

763
00:58:36,017 --> 00:58:39,699
out there and really structure so we can get these things done.

764
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,419
Those are some suggestions that I have.

765
00:58:41,499 --> 00:58:42,180
Thank you very much.

766
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,260
Thank you, Mr. McKillop.

767
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,000
Mr. President.

768
00:58:44,581 --> 00:58:45,701
Councilor Mox.

769
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:49,103
Just if I could, Mr. McKillop brings up a great point.

770
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:54,105
And in this city, we have an ordinance called the clean it or lean it ordinance.

771
00:58:54,785 --> 00:59:05,830
So the city of Method, if they don't like how you clean your property or maintain your property, they can go in there, put a lean on your property and hire an outside contractor to clean your property.

772
00:59:06,734 --> 00:59:16,780
But here we have a state agency that can leave their roads in deplorable condition, can leave them unkept, Mr. President, and there's no recourse we have as a community.

773
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:24,485
So I agree with Mr. McKillop that there should be something, some type of recourse that we have to say, you know, enough's enough.

774
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:30,289
And the cleaner the cleaner, I don't know if the state would fall back on our local ordinance.

775
00:59:30,749 --> 00:59:35,472
You know, the residents are at our mercy, but I'm not sure the state would, Mr. President,

776
00:59:36,134 --> 00:59:47,759
He brings up a valid point and so does Vice President Knight about maybe in the spirit of cooperation, that we can sign some type of agreement that would enable us to do.

777
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:49,259
I've said that for years.

778
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:54,261
If you live on a state road right now and want your tree trimmed, you've got to go to the state.

779
00:59:54,822 --> 00:59:58,383
If you live on a state road, you want your sidewalk done, you have to go to the state.

780
00:59:58,901 --> 01:00:01,122
And it's an act of Congress to get it done.

781
01:00:01,882 --> 01:00:05,784
You're paying the same tax as someone else that doesn't live on a state road.

782
01:00:06,124 --> 01:00:13,987
So there's no benefit of living on a state road other than the fact that you have to chase the state to do stuff on your street.

783
01:00:14,087 --> 01:00:16,568
So, you know, I've been saying this for years.

784
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:21,110
I would personally like to see the city take over all these roads, Mr. President.

785
01:00:21,432 --> 01:00:25,515
and have us accountable to the residents because the residents know us.

786
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:29,098
They don't know these people in DCR or in these other state agencies.

787
01:00:29,438 --> 01:00:32,800
They know the people here and the local officials and the local government.

788
01:00:33,161 --> 01:00:38,284
And I think it's a much better approach to have us responsible rather than some state agency.

789
01:00:38,524 --> 01:00:39,265
Thank you, Mr. President.

790
01:00:40,286 --> 01:00:41,286
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

791
01:00:42,327 --> 01:00:46,150
Okay, any further discussion on public participation?

792
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:51,281
Good evening.

793
01:00:51,462 --> 01:00:51,862
Good evening.

794
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:52,963
Name and address of the record, please.

795
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:54,544
My name is Tom Sutherland.

796
01:00:55,025 --> 01:00:56,246
I was married to Jean Barry.

797
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,889
And I'm here to talk on behalf of the name of the Columbus School.

798
01:01:00,649 --> 01:01:02,031
Thank you.

799
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:04,433
Me and Jean were married for over 22 years.

800
01:01:05,213 --> 01:01:10,378
And I just want to know how she was a dedicated teacher and an accomplished principal.

801
01:01:12,399 --> 01:01:15,142
I've learned quite a bit about Jean.

802
01:01:15,302 --> 01:01:16,703
She was very, very smart.

803
01:01:19,557 --> 01:01:28,102
I remember one time I came home from work, when we first got married, I came home from work at 4.35 o'clock, and she came walking in the house at 7.38 o'clock.

804
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:32,785
So I said to Jean, Jean, you think we can get home a little bit earlier?

805
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:34,526
And she says, why?

806
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:35,706
Because I like to eat earlier.

807
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:38,348
And she says, well, I don't know.

808
01:01:38,368 --> 01:01:39,649
I said, Jean, you're the boss.

809
01:01:40,769 --> 01:01:41,670
She said, I know I'm the boss.

810
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:43,871
I'm also the boss here, and I'll get home when I can.

811
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:44,772
You know?

812
01:01:46,372 --> 01:01:47,113
On our wedding day,

813
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:49,373
We got married at St.

814
01:01:49,413 --> 01:01:54,396
Joseph's, and as we were leaving the church, I saw this big smile come over Jean's face.

815
01:01:55,716 --> 01:01:58,978
She looked over and she saw her entire fifth grade class sitting there.

816
01:02:01,979 --> 01:02:04,780
Smiling, waving to her, they were so happy to see her teacher get married.

817
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:08,802
On the way to reception, I said to Jean, that was nice, was that your whole class?

818
01:02:09,102 --> 01:02:12,484
She said, that was her entire class that showed up to see her get married.

819
01:02:14,265 --> 01:02:14,505
Jean,

820
01:02:17,472 --> 01:02:19,033
had a real good sense of humor.

821
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:22,475
She was a teacher with the fifth grade at the same school.

822
01:02:22,796 --> 01:02:28,139
And the last day of the year, she would get the biggest kid, the biggest boy in the class in arm wrestle.

823
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,141
And she did it for 15, 16 years.

824
01:02:32,242 --> 01:02:36,265
So one day she was going to the last day at the same school and I said, you're doing arm wrestle today?

825
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:38,306
She said, I don't know, I think I'm in trouble.

826
01:02:38,326 --> 01:02:39,107
I said, why?

827
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:42,469
She said, this kid's awful big and he's been practicing.

828
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,331
So she came home that night

829
01:02:46,936 --> 01:02:47,797
And I said, what'd you do?

830
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:48,897
She said, I won.

831
01:02:49,338 --> 01:02:49,898
How'd you win?

832
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:51,699
I told him we had to change arms.

833
01:02:54,722 --> 01:02:55,402
She was smart.

834
01:02:58,945 --> 01:03:01,827
She volunteered for the Polar Express.

835
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:07,411
She also volunteered to have a theme day at the Columbus School.

836
01:03:08,111 --> 01:03:12,274
She thought that education should be fun, and she thought the kids really needed it.

837
01:03:15,352 --> 01:03:17,073
One day out of every month, there was a theme.

838
01:03:17,113 --> 01:03:21,277
It could be the Patriots, it could be the Bruins, it could be Halloween, but the kids would wear a costume.

839
01:03:22,158 --> 01:03:24,760
So Jean said, why should the kids have all the costumes?

840
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,961
Well, it was her costume.

841
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:33,487
It's a very elegant gown, all kinds of fancy ribbons on it, a tiara, and a wrap.

842
01:03:34,007 --> 01:03:37,150
And as the kids showed up, she told all the kids that she was the queen of the Columbus school.

843
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:42,634
And she would walk around the school that whole day and go into the cafeteria and have a lot of fun.

844
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:49,877
A lot of times, Jean was a famous walker, you know, and we'd be walking on buses or something like that.

845
01:03:49,897 --> 01:03:52,658
She would never be running to a, you know, a farmer student.

846
01:03:53,478 --> 01:03:54,878
You know, it always began the same way.

847
01:03:54,898 --> 01:04:04,721
They would embrace, they would have a great conversation, they would laugh, and the farmer student would always say to her, it was so great to see you, Ms.

848
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:05,061
Barry.

849
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:10,042
And she would come back to me and she would say, you know, that was, I had her over 20 years ago,

850
01:04:12,023 --> 01:04:16,105
She's married, she's got three kids, her husband's an electrician, and she's having a great life.

851
01:04:16,305 --> 01:04:20,307
I think that was Jean's reward, you know, that she was a part of this person's life.

852
01:04:22,388 --> 01:04:24,329
Excuse me.

853
01:04:24,709 --> 01:04:26,770
You know, Jean passed away about five years ago.

854
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:35,375
You know, I had talked to Fred DeLaRusso, and he said, no, we should start the wake at three o'clock, because there'll be a lot of people.

855
01:04:35,495 --> 01:04:38,336
Well, we started the wake at three o'clock, and the wake didn't get over until about 9.15.

856
01:04:39,096 --> 01:04:40,337
The line finally stopped, you know.

857
01:04:41,368 --> 01:04:52,575
While I was standing up there greeting the people who came to pay respects to Jean, I looked down, her entire medical staff, Dr. Urban and his entire medical staff had shown up for the week.

858
01:04:53,236 --> 01:04:58,599
They came up, they felt so bad that they could have done more for Jean and told me what a great person she was.

859
01:04:59,319 --> 01:05:01,601
She was a patient of Dr. Urban's for about eight years.

860
01:05:05,663 --> 01:05:07,665
I think the one thing that really affected me the most was

861
01:05:09,148 --> 01:05:13,852
I looked down, there's a little guy standing, he was about 35 years old, you know, and he was standing by himself.

862
01:05:14,973 --> 01:05:19,496
So when he came up to me and shook my hand, he told me that he was in Jean's fifth grade class.

863
01:05:20,717 --> 01:05:21,057
I said, good.

864
01:05:21,077 --> 01:05:23,519
And he said, I talked to Jean quite a bit, but he moved out of state.

865
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,081
He said, I talked to her by phone once in a while.

866
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:28,563
I feel so bad that she passed away.

867
01:05:28,743 --> 01:05:30,164
She was one of the best teachers I ever had.

868
01:05:31,305 --> 01:05:36,269
He looked at me real serious and he says, the life's lessons I learned in the fifth grade with Jean, I still use today.

869
01:05:39,155 --> 01:05:42,316
You know, impression of being left with people was amazing.

870
01:05:42,436 --> 01:05:49,759
You know, I can understand, you know, I can understand, you know, people just love Jean.

871
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:59,443
I know a lot of these newer, everyone is, probably everyone is knowing, you know, she always had such a, you know, positive attitude, you know, and a great personality.

872
01:05:59,503 --> 01:06:05,626
But anyway, you know, I know the school, it's a big thing to go on right now, you know,

873
01:06:07,052 --> 01:06:12,896
You know, I'm here to say, you know, I think the name Gene Barry School would be a great school, a great name for school if it's possible.

874
01:06:13,256 --> 01:06:16,078
But I'm sure there'll probably be a lot of qualified candidates to get it, you know.

875
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:24,623
But, you know, I'll finish this by saying that, you know, I think Method was very happy and very lucky to have Gene in the community.

876
01:06:24,643 --> 01:06:28,326
I mean, she was a dedicated teacher and a great community worker, you know.

877
01:06:28,346 --> 01:06:31,628
I think, you know, all the accolades you guys were well-deserved.

878
01:06:32,968 --> 01:06:33,949
I'd like to thank you for your time.

879
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:35,290
Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.

880
01:06:39,152 --> 01:06:41,514
Thank you, Mr President.

881
01:06:41,694 --> 01:06:50,902
If I can, Mr Sutherland, as one councilor that I could tell you that I was privileged to work for her on special occasions.

882
01:06:52,283 --> 01:07:00,850
Jean was a very dedicated and loving person to everybody that crossed that doorway at the Columbus School and the Dane.

883
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:05,113
I remember when they first opened the new Columbus and

884
01:07:07,785 --> 01:07:14,068
And I was a phys ed teacher at McGlynn, and we had to teach the ever-growing class to the fifth grade.

885
01:07:14,669 --> 01:07:18,431
And Jean brought me in, and she says, George, at the time, there was a female phys ed teacher.

886
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:22,653
She says, I need you to work with my young men in my fifth grade.

887
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:35,140
And she gave me strict instructions, and making sure that was very delicate, and making sure that most of these kids came from single-family homes that, obviously, we all know that abuts the housing projects.

888
01:07:36,233 --> 01:07:48,242
She wanted to make sure that I spent extra time making sure that we gave the time that they needed if they had any questions, because a lot of those kids didn't have a male role model in their lives, as she felt.

889
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,024
And that was her heart.

890
01:07:50,664 --> 01:07:53,907
And she was very caring to everybody that came in those doors.

891
01:07:54,147 --> 01:07:58,550
I remember when I was given the privilege of running the summertime programs.

892
01:07:59,731 --> 01:08:04,675
Principals are very, very territorial when it comes to their schools, even when it's not in session.

893
01:08:05,228 --> 01:08:19,295
And I remember Jean, when we went out looking for a school where we could do it, Jean stepped up and said, I would love to have that program, that summer program in our school, because it'll benefit that neighborhood and those kids most of all.

894
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:27,199
And she wasn't shy when it came to tell you how she felt.

895
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,120
And I respected that so much.

896
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,222
And both her and the whole family, I think all of her,

897
01:08:34,716 --> 01:08:38,578
brothers and sisters can say that they really meant something.

898
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:44,602
They really put forth a dedicated effort to the city of Medford.

899
01:08:45,042 --> 01:09:03,272
And I know there are other names on the list and that's a process in the school committee, but I want to make sure that this council made sure that someone who worked with her on a daily basis at times really understood the impact she made in that community, that South Medford community.

900
01:09:05,256 --> 01:09:12,399
I applaud you for coming up and sharing your stories about one of the greatest women around.

901
01:09:12,959 --> 01:09:18,961
And I tell you, I used to duck when I used to drive down Governor Zapp, because she used to fly or walk.

902
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:20,401
I don't know how he kept up with that pace.

903
01:09:20,461 --> 01:09:26,403
But I was always embarrassed, because she had bigger biceps than me when I'd walk into the pizzeria.

904
01:09:26,744 --> 01:09:27,584
But thank you.

905
01:09:28,024 --> 01:09:28,344
Thank you.

906
01:09:33,206 --> 01:09:33,766
Also, Mr. President?

907
01:09:35,107 --> 01:09:50,039
I think it's important, Mr. President, that as we look at this whole entire process of the name change, that we don't get overly emotional and start to make this a political issue.

908
01:09:50,179 --> 01:09:56,004
It's a political issue and the family should not be subjected to the politics of this process, right?

909
01:09:56,444 --> 01:10:00,247
Jean Barry Sutherland was nominated because she was someone that made a great difference in this community.

910
01:10:01,192 --> 01:10:13,375
And I think that, you know, going forward, she should be remembered for all the positive things that she did in this community and not be part of a political campaign to discredit her as they move forward in this political process of renaming the school.

911
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:16,175
Because I didn't have the privilege of going to the Dame School.

912
01:10:16,195 --> 01:10:26,637
I went to the Brooks, but right around junior high, I got a lot of friends that were over there at the Dame School that had Jean Barry, my friend, David Topper, very, very successful.

913
01:10:27,117 --> 01:10:29,858
To this day, he says, it's all because of Jean Barry.

914
01:10:30,825 --> 01:10:32,947
She gave them the tools to succeed.

915
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:38,610
So with that being said, you know, I just hope that the people out there in the community realize that Jean Barry has a family.

916
01:10:39,011 --> 01:10:40,011
Her family's here this evening.

917
01:10:40,772 --> 01:10:43,614
I don't think they're here this evening because the political process has been good to them.

918
01:10:44,194 --> 01:10:50,679
And as we move forward, I hope that we can move forward with some sensitivity because Jean's loss is still new and every day these people hurt.

919
01:10:50,819 --> 01:10:53,260
So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence.

920
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:54,201
Well said.

921
01:10:54,801 --> 01:10:55,402
Thank you, Vice President.

922
01:10:57,276 --> 01:10:58,777
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

923
01:10:59,077 --> 01:11:01,079
Good evening, my name is Marion Barry Ravani.

924
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:03,140
I live at 11 Thomas Street in Saugus.

925
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:06,283
I am a former resident of the city of Medford for many, many years.

926
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:11,627
I am Gene's sister, Gene's Barry Sutherland sister.

927
01:11:12,207 --> 01:11:17,651
And I am not here to defend my sister, Gene, by any stretch of the imagination.

928
01:11:18,132 --> 01:11:20,233
Gene's reputation stands alone.

929
01:11:22,215 --> 01:11:24,837
Gene was probably the best gift that my parents ever gave me.

930
01:11:26,019 --> 01:11:41,071
When I hear you counselors talking about the Colangeli family and the Andre family, and the words that you said about community and giving back and respect and volunteerism, that's who Jean Barry was.

931
01:11:41,871 --> 01:11:43,553
Jean was the oldest of eight children.

932
01:11:43,573 --> 01:11:44,894
She took charge.

933
01:11:45,054 --> 01:11:46,455
She worked hard all her life.

934
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:49,858
She ran the snack bar at the Medford Bowl Club.

935
01:11:49,918 --> 01:11:51,399
She was a camp counselor.

936
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:55,042
She worked at the registry when she was going through school.

937
01:11:58,001 --> 01:11:59,841
Jean stood up for the underdog.

938
01:12:00,201 --> 01:12:01,961
She always stood up for the underdog.

939
01:12:02,482 --> 01:12:03,362
She was fair.

940
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,722
She said what was on her mind.

941
01:12:06,303 --> 01:12:09,443
She said what she meant, but she always had the caring words.

942
01:12:10,804 --> 01:12:25,227
Some of the young people that were in her class through the years, whether it be at the Waite School, she was at the Gleason School, she was at the Dame School, excuse me, and she finished up her career at the Columbus School.

943
01:12:28,012 --> 01:12:37,394
They are now police chiefs, firemen, masonaries, business owners, painters.

944
01:12:38,594 --> 01:12:40,875
Jean made a positive difference.

945
01:12:42,475 --> 01:12:44,235
Jean taught respect.

946
01:12:45,935 --> 01:12:52,016
She taught them when they came into her school, when they came into her class, they were not allowed to wear a baseball cap.

947
01:12:52,817 --> 01:12:55,097
They were up in arms, the parents were up in arms.

948
01:12:56,028 --> 01:13:00,529
But when all was said and done, those kids knew what respect was.

949
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:05,351
She taught them to treat each other as ladies and gentlemen.

950
01:13:06,231 --> 01:13:14,174
Tom said how they had dress-up days, and Jean would have the kids, the boys, pull out the chair for the girl and hold the door.

951
01:13:15,014 --> 01:13:18,735
She was a positive influence in their life.

952
01:13:19,255 --> 01:13:23,096
There were a lot of families in a lot of situations.

953
01:13:24,057 --> 01:13:25,137
They were broken families.

954
01:13:25,974 --> 01:13:29,696
And she never, never pointed that out.

955
01:13:29,776 --> 01:13:31,497
She brought these kids together.

956
01:13:31,557 --> 01:13:33,238
She brought the families together.

957
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:36,740
She loves the City of Medford.

958
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,061
She truly loved the City of Medford.

959
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:40,902
She loved being a teacher.

960
01:13:41,562 --> 01:13:45,404
She said not having any children of her own, all these kids were her kids.

961
01:13:48,406 --> 01:13:51,627
For those of you who never met my sister, Jean, I'm sorry you didn't.

962
01:13:53,468 --> 01:13:55,089
She was an outstanding person.

963
01:13:55,668 --> 01:14:00,632
And for all of you who do know her, I appreciate all the support that you have shown her.

964
01:14:02,053 --> 01:14:03,475
It has been a tough time.

965
01:14:03,895 --> 01:14:06,477
Jean died only five years ago in December, Jean died.

966
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:09,360
But she never gave up the fight.

967
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,421
She never gave up the fight.

968
01:14:11,902 --> 01:14:22,371
She was there till the end with, you know, the Jingle Bell Festival, the Polar Express, you know, she just showed up for life.

969
01:14:24,372 --> 01:14:25,592
So I appreciate your time.

970
01:14:25,772 --> 01:14:27,013
I appreciate your support.

971
01:14:27,513 --> 01:14:27,853
Thank you.

972
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:34,315
Thank you.

973
01:14:34,395 --> 01:14:35,375
Thank you, Mr. President.

974
01:14:35,495 --> 01:14:38,816
And I want to thank Jean's family for coming up tonight.

975
01:14:38,836 --> 01:14:53,100
You know, Jean's name made it to the final 18 because of what Jean did in this community and the number of people she impacted over the many decades.

976
01:14:53,992 --> 01:14:57,794
and her public service to this community.

977
01:14:58,295 --> 01:15:00,296
So it is a fitting tribute.

978
01:15:00,976 --> 01:15:11,902
And I think it speaks volumes that Jean is a finalist because of her past, Mr. President, and what made her such a great person in our community.

979
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:22,208
You know, one thing I can recall, and this is going back many, many years ago, when I was first elected to the school committee, I was a real youngster at the time.

980
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:30,524
And we had our first negotiations with the Teachers Association and the school committee.

981
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:43,855
And we'd sit in separate rooms, I don't know if it's still done the same way, we'd sit in separate rooms and we'd go back and forth, volley back and forth with, this is what we're gonna offer you, this is what we want you to give up, back and forth.

982
01:15:43,935 --> 01:15:48,359
And it got so contentious, Mr. President, for several days,

983
01:15:49,798 --> 01:15:55,183
wasn't until Gene Barry stood up and said, why don't we meet in the same room together?

984
01:15:55,684 --> 01:16:00,368
You know, what a novel idea, bring people together, rather than have them in separate rooms.

985
01:16:00,949 --> 01:16:04,852
And you know what happens when you're in separate rooms, you're tougher in separate rooms, right?

986
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:07,615
And you want to play hard guy when you're in separate rooms.

987
01:16:08,195 --> 01:16:11,158
And when we Gene brought us together, Mr. President,

988
01:16:11,461 --> 01:16:13,142
And the words still went back and forth.

989
01:16:13,482 --> 01:16:14,003
Guess what?

990
01:16:14,343 --> 01:16:21,868
It was Gene Barry that stood up and said, we need to do this, not just for the teachers and the administrators, but for the children.

991
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:28,853
And that really struck home to a lot of people, Mr. President, because we said, let's put politics aside, right?

992
01:16:29,314 --> 01:16:34,318
And it was Gene that stood up and brought us together and made for a successful negotiation.

993
01:16:34,858 --> 01:16:41,624
And that was my very first, really, my very first introduction to what I'd say is politics in this community.

994
01:16:41,965 --> 01:16:43,486
And it was Gene that stood up

995
01:16:44,215 --> 01:16:45,296
to bring people together.

996
01:16:45,576 --> 01:16:47,857
And she did that over her whole career.

997
01:16:48,157 --> 01:16:53,560
If you ever saw Jean in the street, as Councilor Scott Kelly mentioned, she'd be walking with her and her husband.

998
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,681
They'd be out there in the community, Mr. President.

999
01:16:55,902 --> 01:16:56,622
She'd wave to you.

1000
01:16:56,642 --> 01:16:57,262
She'd say hi.

1001
01:16:57,502 --> 01:17:00,304
She'd take a second to talk to you, even if she was on a power walk.

1002
01:17:00,724 --> 01:17:02,885
That was the type of person Jean was.

1003
01:17:03,406 --> 01:17:04,166
It was in her heart.

1004
01:17:04,466 --> 01:17:07,188
There wasn't a phony bone in her body.

1005
01:17:07,668 --> 01:17:08,709
That's who Jean was.

1006
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:10,430
You couldn't change who Jean was.

1007
01:17:11,269 --> 01:17:38,755
And Mr. President, I think what I'm hoping happens during this process is that the 18 names that came up, Mr. President, they'll probably be vetted out, they'll be looked at, Mr. President, and they'll be discussed on merit, Mr. President, not on other circumstances that may become political or may be used as a political tool, but from the circumstance of the person's life and what that person did.

1008
01:17:39,096 --> 01:17:41,036
And clearly, Gene Barry,

1009
01:17:41,633 --> 01:17:44,654
represents everything that this community stands for.

1010
01:17:45,174 --> 01:17:51,156
And I think everyone would be honored if that's the case, to have Gene Barry's name on the school, Mr. President.

1011
01:17:51,636 --> 01:17:56,358
Everyone would be honored.

1012
01:17:56,378 --> 01:17:57,138
Thank you, Dr. Marks.

1013
01:17:57,158 --> 01:17:57,738
Thank you, Mr. President.

1014
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:01,599
Good evening.

1015
01:18:01,619 --> 01:18:02,640
Name and address of the record, please.

1016
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,800
John Petrova, 61 Locust Street.

1017
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,301
I'm honored.

1018
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:09,802
Longtime resident of Medford,

1019
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,086
Very proud to say that, I love the city.

1020
01:18:13,786 --> 01:18:17,007
I can stand here and talk for hours about Gene.

1021
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:20,789
My wife, if she could make it tonight, would be doing the same.

1022
01:18:21,649 --> 01:18:23,650
No one's gonna say a bad word about Gene.

1023
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:33,433
The only one that's gonna say something bad about Gene is on the committee to decide what the name's gonna be for the Columbus School.

1024
01:18:34,093 --> 01:18:36,434
And I don't know if you are all aware of this.

1025
01:18:37,514 --> 01:18:39,615
Maybe you are, maybe you aren't.

1026
01:18:40,393 --> 01:18:43,195
We're all aware of it, okay?

1027
01:18:44,236 --> 01:18:47,298
There's a couple of people on that committee.

1028
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:50,821
Mr. Petrolla, if you refrain from mentioning anyone's name.

1029
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:52,842
I will not mention anyone's name.

1030
01:18:53,803 --> 01:18:54,664
I would never do that.

1031
01:18:54,864 --> 01:18:55,164
Thank you.

1032
01:18:55,204 --> 01:18:56,725
I would hope you know me better than that.

1033
01:18:57,426 --> 01:18:59,447
Anyhow, there's a couple of people on the committee.

1034
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:06,733
I was like, it's just, I can't even begin to tell you.

1035
01:19:08,247 --> 01:19:28,905
how frustrating and how depressing it is to have this committee that was put together by the school committee decide who's gonna have the school named after him.

1036
01:19:29,746 --> 01:19:33,469
Because I'm gonna tell you right now, I'll be the bad guy.

1037
01:19:35,205 --> 01:19:40,807
it's not going to be what the people of Medford want it to be.

1038
01:19:43,108 --> 01:19:44,489
No one can tell me different.

1039
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:46,830
Nobody.

1040
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:50,151
What was said about Gene was disgusting.

1041
01:19:52,232 --> 01:19:53,992
Absolutely disgusting.

1042
01:19:54,052 --> 01:19:58,054
And I assume you guys all know, and you're saying about

1043
01:19:59,215 --> 01:20:06,218
Facebook chatter, and this ain't about people disagreeing, and this ain't about politics, okay?

1044
01:20:07,459 --> 01:20:08,199
It really isn't.

1045
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:17,184
This whole Columbus school is devastating, it's tearing the city apart, okay?

1046
01:20:18,024 --> 01:20:20,385
It should have never happened, okay?

1047
01:20:21,826 --> 01:20:24,307
It became an issue, it was brought up,

1048
01:20:25,622 --> 01:20:31,346
regardless of all the signatures and the 1,200 or 1,300 people that didn't want the name change.

1049
01:20:33,368 --> 01:20:41,834
I think I speak for a lot of people, Italian Americans, when I say that we would be honored, honored to have Jeannie.

1050
01:20:43,695 --> 01:20:54,983
But how could we possibly believe after what was said by two members and the person that appointed them

1051
01:20:56,223 --> 01:20:57,004
to that committee.

1052
01:20:58,605 --> 01:21:00,667
How can we believe it's a fair process?

1053
01:21:01,928 --> 01:21:10,115
I'm asking somebody, this whole process, okay, should be just, this committee needs to be, to just go away, all right?

1054
01:21:10,155 --> 01:21:15,419
Because Gene would win by a landslide, but that's not the way it's gonna happen.

1055
01:21:15,639 --> 01:21:18,001
I mean, look at the 18 finalists.

1056
01:21:18,061 --> 01:21:21,944
Gene's got, I don't know the exact numbers, 130, closest person to her got 20 votes, 25 votes.

1057
01:21:26,443 --> 01:21:35,166
but I can almost guarantee you that when, and it's unfortunate, but when it comes down to it, we all know what's going on with the school committee.

1058
01:21:36,467 --> 01:21:38,107
I have nothing against nobody.

1059
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:39,528
I really don't.

1060
01:21:40,268 --> 01:21:41,768
It's good to see you all here.

1061
01:21:41,868 --> 01:21:44,469
And it's, you know, like I said, I love this city.

1062
01:21:44,729 --> 01:21:45,370
I really do.

1063
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:54,413
And there's a lot of other things I wanted to bring up tonight, but this has got to be for Jean and Jean only tonight in the Columbus school.

1064
01:21:55,803 --> 01:22:00,968
There was also comments made about white Italian Americans.

1065
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,833
Those were the only ones that voted for Jeanne.

1066
01:22:05,994 --> 01:22:09,417
And we don't know how she treated black children.

1067
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,702
That's what was said.

1068
01:22:15,224 --> 01:22:16,085
Okay, so.

1069
01:22:17,168 --> 01:22:18,429
I'm just disgusted.

1070
01:22:18,969 --> 01:22:23,492
You won't get a person anywhere in the city to say anything bad about her.

1071
01:22:24,112 --> 01:22:31,937
Yet we have people on that committee had the nerve to say those words, to put them on a post.

1072
01:22:34,779 --> 01:22:36,720
They need to be taken off that committee.

1073
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,302
That whole committee should be just completely

1074
01:22:42,415 --> 01:22:45,756
You know, it just needs to be done.

1075
01:22:45,796 --> 01:22:49,996
Someone's gotta stand up and speak for everybody.

1076
01:22:51,157 --> 01:22:53,117
Somebody has to stand up.

1077
01:22:53,497 --> 01:22:54,857
It has to be done.

1078
01:22:56,797 --> 01:23:00,278
The Columbus School name change is a fuss.

1079
01:23:00,878 --> 01:23:06,719
Everyone in Medford knows it.

1080
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:09,820
You know, in the old days, we'd call it a bag job.

1081
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,160
And that's what this is.

1082
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:23,523
If the school committee is gonna get the final three names, I don't care if Jean has 10,000 names, you can bet they're not gonna give it to her.

1083
01:23:25,244 --> 01:23:27,905
So I don't know what you guys can do about it.

1084
01:23:28,245 --> 01:23:31,446
The mayor is silent, everyone's silent.

1085
01:23:32,886 --> 01:23:39,348
Everybody, the human rights commission, denigrating the American flag, the police chief,

1086
01:23:40,069 --> 01:23:42,611
The mayor... Okay, we're getting up.

1087
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:45,073
I'm just saying it's silence.

1088
01:23:45,773 --> 01:23:46,394
It's silence.

1089
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:47,094
It's got to end.

1090
01:23:47,434 --> 01:23:49,976
And this is where it's got to end with this Columbus school.

1091
01:23:50,777 --> 01:23:52,418
Someone has to do something.

1092
01:23:53,058 --> 01:23:55,060
I don't know who can do anything.

1093
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:58,142
But this committee needs to go away.

1094
01:23:58,282 --> 01:23:59,022
It does.

1095
01:23:59,543 --> 01:24:00,263
It needs to go away.

1096
01:24:03,326 --> 01:24:06,787
And I'm sure you guys are all aware of what's going on.

1097
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:08,047
So I'll leave it at that.

1098
01:24:09,487 --> 01:24:10,607
Nothing else I can say.

1099
01:24:17,869 --> 01:24:18,689
Any further discussion?

1100
01:24:22,469 --> 01:24:26,010
Sorry, I just have the numbers in case anybody wanted to know.

1101
01:24:26,530 --> 01:24:28,230
They posted during a meeting.

1102
01:24:29,151 --> 01:24:31,591
I'm not sure, I don't have it notated in front of me,

1103
01:24:31,998 --> 01:24:33,459
but I did take a screenshot.

1104
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:39,084
It's 114 people that submitted for Jean Barry Elementary School.

1105
01:24:39,604 --> 01:24:48,231
The next one was 22 submissions for Mystic Elementary, and then they decreased by their significant one.

1106
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:49,272
Thank you, Jean.

1107
01:24:49,733 --> 01:24:50,533
Councilor Falco.

1108
01:24:50,974 --> 01:24:51,694
Thank you, Mr. President.

1109
01:24:51,714 --> 01:24:57,219
I also want to thank the Barry and Sutherland families for coming down today and sharing your personal stories.

1110
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,882
I had the privilege to know

1111
01:25:01,858 --> 01:25:04,640
Miss Barry was a member of the school committee.

1112
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:08,622
And she was always positive, always smiling.

1113
01:25:08,642 --> 01:25:11,423
I remember the smile, always smiling.

1114
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:13,164
And you mentioned she was a gift.

1115
01:25:13,785 --> 01:25:16,346
And she was a gift to our community.

1116
01:25:16,406 --> 01:25:19,448
She was always there, always giving back.

1117
01:25:19,688 --> 01:25:25,531
I personally did not go to the Columbus school or any of the schools that she taught at, but my nieces and nephews did.

1118
01:25:26,351 --> 01:25:29,333
And I always heard great stories about Miss Barry.

1119
01:25:30,122 --> 01:25:31,982
and the work she did on a daily basis.

1120
01:25:32,542 --> 01:25:34,323
And they would talk continuously about her.

1121
01:25:35,443 --> 01:25:37,683
And during school community meetings, you'd always hear Ms.

1122
01:25:37,723 --> 01:25:41,884
Barry's name come up and the great things that were happening at the Columbus School.

1123
01:25:42,644 --> 01:25:47,145
And I can't thank you enough for coming down and sharing your personal stories with us.

1124
01:25:48,665 --> 01:25:53,506
I know they mean the world to me because I knew Jean and she was fabulous.

1125
01:25:53,546 --> 01:25:59,887
And like I said, I never forget the smile and the positive upbeat attitude, which this community could use now more than ever.

1126
01:26:00,748 --> 01:26:02,691
And I just want to thank you for coming tonight.

1127
01:26:02,711 --> 01:26:03,432
Thank you.

1128
01:26:14,945 --> 01:26:16,706
Hi, most of you people know me.

1129
01:26:16,766 --> 01:26:20,888
For the people that don't know me, I'm a Lockton, Medford resident.

1130
01:26:21,389 --> 01:26:26,711
Had a business here in town for over 28 years, Lister Insurance on Central Avenue.

1131
01:26:27,292 --> 01:26:30,674
I've been very involved in the community for a number of years.

1132
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:39,178
I was a Little League, I'm sorry, a T-ball coach for the South Medford T-ball League, and the team actually won.

1133
01:26:41,472 --> 01:26:41,852
twice.

1134
01:26:42,732 --> 01:26:45,353
I was also a soccer mom.

1135
01:26:45,753 --> 01:26:51,394
I also was secretary of the board of directors of Temple Shalom.

1136
01:26:52,195 --> 01:26:57,836
I was vice president of the Salem Street Business Association, worked closely with Tom Convery.

1137
01:26:58,336 --> 01:27:11,179
I also became president of the Salem Street Business Association for three years until we decided to break apart and merge with the Chamber of Commerce.

1138
01:27:12,199 --> 01:27:18,520
I've done a lot of social work for the community, participated in DARE events.

1139
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:22,481
Also, personally, I know.

1140
01:27:22,601 --> 01:27:27,562
I'll bring the mic closer.

1141
01:27:27,582 --> 01:27:28,842
Too much reverberation.

1142
01:27:28,882 --> 01:27:30,162
We appreciate all your services.

1143
01:27:30,202 --> 01:27:32,163
I have a big voice, I'm sorry.

1144
01:27:32,263 --> 01:27:32,443
Okay.

1145
01:27:32,883 --> 01:27:34,343
If you could speak on the topic.

1146
01:27:34,963 --> 01:27:40,884
Okay, so the point I'm trying to get at is, done a lot for this community.

1147
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,820
My son went to the Columbus School.

1148
01:27:44,441 --> 01:27:46,261
I loved this community.

1149
01:27:47,701 --> 01:27:48,882
My heart hurts.

1150
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:50,922
It's torn apart.

1151
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:53,002
I have been ridiculed.

1152
01:27:53,382 --> 01:27:56,883
I went to the police, support the police rally.

1153
01:27:57,383 --> 01:27:58,924
I was called a Nazi.

1154
01:27:59,504 --> 01:28:02,184
This Jewish woman was called a Nazi.

1155
01:28:03,464 --> 01:28:06,965
And I was blamed for bringing Method Youth there.

1156
01:28:08,525 --> 01:28:10,906
Betsy, if we could stay on the topic.

1157
01:28:11,557 --> 01:28:31,064
appreciate me I thought the topic was public, but it's okay so upset about besides a number of things is that I feel the school committee is ramming their agenda down our throat.

1158
01:28:31,704 --> 01:28:34,005
I really feel that the school children

1159
01:28:34,703 --> 01:28:39,287
This is a farce, as John said, this whole rigmarole.

1160
01:28:39,867 --> 01:28:45,091
And what's being left out is the most important thing of this community, our children.

1161
01:28:45,832 --> 01:28:52,337
Our children are being pushed aside while we decide upon the name of a school.

1162
01:28:52,858 --> 01:28:55,340
Please don't insult our intelligence.

1163
01:28:56,307 --> 01:28:58,288
And we don't want to hear anything we say.

1164
01:28:58,348 --> 01:28:59,708
It's like we get poo-poo.

1165
01:29:00,028 --> 01:29:02,649
This is absolutely ridiculous.

1166
01:29:03,089 --> 01:29:08,470
And I'm tired of the agenda that's being taught, which is Marxist and communist.

1167
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:09,891
And I said it.

1168
01:29:10,931 --> 01:29:17,873
And I'm just tired of the attitude the school committee's got to go, because they don't benefit us.

1169
01:29:18,393 --> 01:29:21,598
We the people are the people of this city.

1170
01:29:21,998 --> 01:29:22,699
Not them.

1171
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,302
They don't rule us.

1172
01:29:24,482 --> 01:29:26,345
They're supposed to do our bidding.

1173
01:29:26,425 --> 01:29:28,528
Right now, they're not doing our bidding.

1174
01:29:29,148 --> 01:29:29,629
Thank you.

1175
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:35,877
Mr. President, I do think we're losing a little bit.

1176
01:29:36,157 --> 01:29:38,178
I think we might be losing a little bit of focus here.

1177
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:44,041
I mean, ultimately this body is not responsible for the naming of the school, the renaming of the school, the process to rename the school.

1178
01:29:44,081 --> 01:29:45,381
And I think that's important to point out.

1179
01:29:45,982 --> 01:29:58,448
The only people that are responsible for the school committee chaired by the mayor, chaired by the mayor, the corner office, the corner office, Mr. President, not this, but this body has no ability to effectuate this change whatsoever.

1180
01:30:00,109 --> 01:30:01,009
Thank you, Mr. President.

1181
01:30:03,005 --> 01:30:08,811
I don't disagree with Vice President Knight, but I think what you're hearing tonight is a sense of frustration.

1182
01:30:09,932 --> 01:30:15,697
This council has always been the only forum that people can come up and speak.

1183
01:30:16,818 --> 01:30:22,764
And over the last year and a half, Mr. President, the school committee, you can only see them on Zoom, Mr. President.

1184
01:30:27,578 --> 01:30:32,740
Mr. President, and I think we have to maintain that this is the forum.

1185
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,841
There may be things said that we don't want to hear tonight.

1186
01:30:36,161 --> 01:30:50,585
There may be things that go off topic, but this is the forum, this is the people's forum, and we have to allow people the ability to come up and say things that may rub us the wrong way, we may agree with, but they have the right to say it.

1187
01:30:51,246 --> 01:30:52,486
And once we stifle that-

1188
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:58,175
I have no problem with what anybody's saying.

1189
01:30:58,295 --> 01:31:01,716
My problem is that there's nothing that we can do to fix it, right?

1190
01:31:01,796 --> 01:31:03,496
I just want to make that clear.

1191
01:31:03,637 --> 01:31:04,877
I agree a thousand percent.

1192
01:31:04,897 --> 01:31:06,137
John, someone's got to do something.

1193
01:31:06,157 --> 01:31:07,017
You got to do this.

1194
01:31:07,057 --> 01:31:07,957
We don't have the power to do it.

1195
01:31:07,997 --> 01:31:09,838
I agree a thousand percent.

1196
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:20,060
But what I just want to make sure is that, you know, it's been a year and a half where people were unable to come up and address their public officials, Mr. President, face to face.

1197
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:25,564
And there's a lot said about being face to face than being on Zoom, Mr. President.

1198
01:31:25,985 --> 01:31:30,589
And I think now what we're seeing is people want to get out, they want to voice their opinion.

1199
01:31:31,149 --> 01:31:37,135
And I think this needs to be the forum, because if we stifle it, there is no other forum in this community.

1200
01:31:37,415 --> 01:31:38,576
So we have to maintain

1201
01:31:38,936 --> 01:31:43,840
this as the ability for people to have a mechanism to vent their concerns, Mr. President.

1202
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:45,181
And I agree with Councilor Knight.

1203
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:48,623
We have no bearing on a school committee vote.

1204
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,344
We have zero bearing.

1205
01:31:50,684 --> 01:31:56,909
You know, if they want to rename the school and set up the committees, really, the only bearing we have is November.

1206
01:31:57,809 --> 01:32:02,513
If people want to make change, November's the time to make change, if you want to make change.

1207
01:32:06,976 --> 01:32:07,296
Thank you.

1208
01:32:07,336 --> 01:32:08,397
Name and address of the record, please.

1209
01:32:08,804 --> 01:32:11,406
Patricia Brady Darty, 235 Winthrop Street.

1210
01:32:13,807 --> 01:32:21,832
The people here tonight aren't so much here to ask you to do something, although some individuals may have said that to you.

1211
01:32:23,353 --> 01:32:33,399
They are here because they're extremely upset about the comments made by the individual, actually written on, I think, Facebook.

1212
01:32:33,519 --> 01:32:34,860
I saw a screenshot of it.

1213
01:32:36,401 --> 01:32:39,303
denigrating the Italians who took the time to vote.

1214
01:32:40,364 --> 01:32:44,808
And he said that they all voted for Gene Barry and they cheated.

1215
01:32:44,828 --> 01:32:46,489
We forgot that important point.

1216
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:49,352
In print, he wrote, and they cheated.

1217
01:32:50,092 --> 01:33:02,342
Well, you know, then the other thing he said, which was said earlier, he wasn't sure that Gene Barry had not treated black children badly.

1218
01:33:03,183 --> 01:33:05,685
Now that's the equivalent of saying when was the last time

1219
01:33:06,722 --> 01:33:08,422
When did you stop beating your wife?

1220
01:33:09,623 --> 01:33:11,583
Those are disgusting statements.

1221
01:33:11,923 --> 01:33:15,404
These people understand that you can't do anything about it.

1222
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:22,985
But as Councilor Mark so eloquently said, this is the people's forum.

1223
01:33:23,606 --> 01:33:26,126
I learned that from serving with Councilor Mayocco.

1224
01:33:27,386 --> 01:33:28,927
He said it over 30 years.

1225
01:33:30,187 --> 01:33:32,327
It's the only public forum in the city.

1226
01:33:34,268 --> 01:33:35,068
How did we get here?

1227
01:33:36,034 --> 01:34:00,103
How did we get to this point from a great city of 58,000 people who have a reputation of racial harmony to the point where we're here because people who are on city commissions say the flag represents rape and pillage and that people that the Italians

1228
01:34:01,299 --> 01:34:09,222
voted on, and maybe they did, and maybe they didn't, cheated, and that the person that they voted for may have mistreated black children.

1229
01:34:09,542 --> 01:34:11,043
How did we get here?

1230
01:34:14,124 --> 01:34:25,369
This is a city that in 1963 elected Madeline Duggar Andrews, the first black school committee person elected in the state of Massachusetts to a school committee.

1231
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:27,290
This is a city that in 1981 put

1232
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:32,766
Ken Holmes on the city council.

1233
01:34:34,666 --> 01:34:38,867
That's not the mark of a racist city and we're sick and tired of hearing it.

1234
01:34:39,347 --> 01:34:40,487
So how did we get there?

1235
01:34:40,807 --> 01:34:48,409
Well, it started when the mayor decided we're a racist city and there was a proclamation that we are racist and it's a health crisis.

1236
01:34:49,089 --> 01:34:52,750
No, we're not a racist city and we're sick of hearing it.

1237
01:34:58,072 --> 01:34:59,972
So what happened in the past year and a half

1238
01:35:01,132 --> 01:35:02,392
and I'll just do the topics.

1239
01:35:02,412 --> 01:35:05,053
You all probably know what happened with the subheadings are.

1240
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:11,634
After that, the Columbus school name changed.

1241
01:35:11,654 --> 01:35:24,457
Then we had the July 4th incident at Exchange Ave where over 200 people threw rockets and firecrackers at the police and they had to call in the state police

1242
01:35:24,935 --> 01:35:27,057
and the firefight is to help defend them.

1243
01:35:27,437 --> 01:35:28,498
And how did that happen?

1244
01:35:28,758 --> 01:35:36,886
Because people had been marching through the streets of Medford, calling the police names and saying, defund the police.

1245
01:35:37,506 --> 01:35:50,718
So then we had the rally here on the steps, as you all know, and at the end of the rally, very peaceful, loving rally, a group of teenagers who were holding Black Lives Matter signs very quietly,

1246
01:35:51,425 --> 01:35:57,047
crossed the parking lot, stood on the steps, and were yelling, F the police.

1247
01:35:57,387 --> 01:35:59,068
They chanted it for several minutes.

1248
01:35:59,108 --> 01:36:00,428
We have it on videotape.

1249
01:36:00,528 --> 01:36:04,610
There's no making that up.

1250
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:10,572
And then, two days later, the people at the rally and the organizers were condemned.

1251
01:36:11,773 --> 01:36:14,714
And not one, were condemned by the mayor's office.

1252
01:36:16,134 --> 01:36:18,115
And that gave ammunition

1253
01:36:18,608 --> 01:36:21,649
for people to start the Racist of Medford website.

1254
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:23,470
I'm on there.

1255
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:25,451
You know why it says I'm a racist?

1256
01:36:25,551 --> 01:36:26,992
Because I supported the rally.

1257
01:36:27,252 --> 01:36:28,953
I was an organizer for the rally.

1258
01:36:29,893 --> 01:36:34,015
Now, I've been a public figure, so people can call me whatever they want.

1259
01:36:34,895 --> 01:36:37,316
They can call me a slut, it doesn't make me one.

1260
01:36:37,976 --> 01:36:38,777
But you know what?

1261
01:36:38,797 --> 01:36:43,659
There are people on that,

1262
01:36:44,857 --> 01:36:49,198
site who never in their lives had their name in public print.

1263
01:36:50,359 --> 01:36:51,759
And they were devastated.

1264
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:59,722
And no one in public office in this city came forward and condemned it.

1265
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:07,224
Then we have racial sensitivity courses at the high school that the teachers had to take this winter.

1266
01:37:08,204 --> 01:37:09,645
Talking about white privilege,

1267
01:37:10,673 --> 01:37:15,474
and how the fact that if you're white, you automatically do not like minorities.

1268
01:37:16,255 --> 01:37:25,097
It's a version of the race theory, critical race theory, that's condemned by many states across this country.

1269
01:37:26,878 --> 01:37:33,780
Now, we don't have white privilege, and we're really sick and tired of people telling us we're racist when we don't see color.

1270
01:37:35,781 --> 01:37:36,761
Then we run into,

1271
01:37:37,785 --> 01:37:49,355
The flag where a commissioner felt it was okay to get up last month in an official meeting and say, the flag represents rape and pillage to certain people.

1272
01:37:50,396 --> 01:37:53,979
And the mayor shouldn't appear next to the flag in a meeting.

1273
01:37:53,999 --> 01:38:05,409
And then we end up last week finding out that the city's asking the state to waive veterans preference when they hired the police.

1274
01:38:08,167 --> 01:38:18,991
And now we're here because someone on a committee empowered to vote for the name change says the Italians cheated.

1275
01:38:21,352 --> 01:38:23,073
I would suggest that's how we got there.

1276
01:38:23,513 --> 01:38:29,275
That whole 18 months and no one's standing up for us, but ourselves in the background.

1277
01:38:30,736 --> 01:38:34,057
Well, we're here to tell you we're not gonna stand for it anymore.

1278
01:38:40,128 --> 01:38:41,389
We are all Americans.

1279
01:38:43,731 --> 01:38:44,411
We are here.

1280
01:38:44,431 --> 01:38:50,596
We're gonna stand in the breach and we're gonna work as a community, as Americans.

1281
01:38:52,658 --> 01:39:01,925
And we happen to believe what Martin Luther King said, which is he didn't want his children judged by the color of their skin.

1282
01:39:02,606 --> 01:39:05,628
He wanted them judged by the content of their character.

1283
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:09,091
And we do have something for you to do.

1284
01:39:10,328 --> 01:39:14,653
We hope that you will take the lead and stop this madness.

1285
01:39:15,715 --> 01:39:21,722
Please emulate Martin Luther King and speak up for us and stand with us.

1286
01:39:21,943 --> 01:39:22,323
Thank you.

1287
01:39:32,903 --> 01:39:34,544
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1288
01:39:34,624 --> 01:39:36,044
Yes, sorry, I have to read from my phone.

1289
01:39:36,144 --> 01:39:41,806
I'm Nadine Moretti, 126 Burgett Ave, and I've been a president of Medford for about 18 years.

1290
01:39:43,887 --> 01:39:46,528
Good evening, Medford City Councilors and fellow citizens.

1291
01:39:47,088 --> 01:39:52,590
Never in my life did I think I would be public speaking as many times as I have during this last year.

1292
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:55,591
Although with the exception of tonight, we're all on Zoom.

1293
01:39:56,451 --> 01:40:02,153
I am not comfortable with it, but have to keep speaking for one reason, the school committee meetings.

1294
01:40:05,313 --> 01:40:11,937
Attempting to censor Medford residents in the abuse of power and authority by some, not all elected school committee members.

1295
01:40:12,498 --> 01:40:20,843
This stems from almost one year of angst for many Medford residents and parents of school age children who attended and spoke on Zoom committee meetings.

1296
01:40:21,883 --> 01:40:25,886
And on a side note, it seems they should be back to person meetings at this point.

1297
01:40:26,886 --> 01:40:32,510
Censorship by definition means the suppression of speech, public communication of words that are offensive.

1298
01:40:33,045 --> 01:40:37,686
seeking to limit our very freedoms of thought and expression by imposing restrictions.

1299
01:40:38,306 --> 01:40:41,167
For example, not being able to state how long we live in Medford.

1300
01:40:42,027 --> 01:40:44,408
This is a direct violation of the First Amendment.

1301
01:40:44,848 --> 01:40:49,770
A school committee member shouldn't believe they hold the power to even think this, nevermind propose it.

1302
01:40:51,110 --> 01:41:02,193
Three months into this ongoing pandemic, the first emails were sent back in June, 2020, after having learned about the resolution to change the beloved Christopher Columbus Elementary School name after 90 years.

1303
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:09,766
Since that time, I alone sent 17 emails to the school committee and spoke at least six to eight meetings.

1304
01:41:09,786 --> 01:41:18,696
95% of my emails were regarding the Columbus name change, with a few other troubling topics concerning race in one way or another.

1305
01:41:20,317 --> 01:41:26,464
Being a parent of two high school students, I was very eager for answers about in-person learning above and beyond the Columbus issue, but

1306
01:41:27,066 --> 01:41:38,056
Columbus became the main focus of the school committee, even after hundreds of residents spoke and or emailed proving that more people were against this name change than for it, but it still moved ahead.

1307
01:41:39,577 --> 01:41:43,901
May 2021, where we have reached a scary level of opposition in Medford.

1308
01:41:44,802 --> 01:41:52,969
The villain and vehicle is social media, which has divided this city via endless posts that continue to defame names of citizens and worse.

1309
01:41:53,873 --> 01:42:01,038
Moreover, we have the Medford Human Rights Commission who held a meeting specifically regarding one citizen and continue to slander him.

1310
01:42:02,358 --> 01:42:06,661
Throughout this last year, not one thing has brought the residents of Medford together.

1311
01:42:07,502 --> 01:42:11,604
This Columbus name change has been at the helm of the division with no end in sight.

1312
01:42:12,505 --> 01:42:16,167
Nobody is putting an end to this uproar and it has reached its breaking point.

1313
01:42:16,687 --> 01:42:18,408
That is why we are here tonight.

1314
01:42:19,129 --> 01:42:22,311
When residents have to come to a city council meeting in droves,

1315
01:42:24,963 --> 01:42:31,886
to speak about other elected officials attempting to violate our First Amendment rights, that is the breaking point, and it's unconscionable.

1316
01:42:32,506 --> 01:42:45,210
Along with this, bringing to light a derogatory, racially-driven, and infuriating libel of our beloved teacher, principal, who for 40 years dedicated her life to teaching and leading Method students is disgraceful.

1317
01:42:46,090 --> 01:42:51,672
June Barry Sutherland is one of the top suggested names for the Columbus Elementary, and a well-deserving one at that.

1318
01:42:52,977 --> 01:42:56,199
I could go on and on, but you understand my point and my purpose tonight.

1319
01:42:56,779 --> 01:43:01,722
To put a stop to the few people attempting to infringe on our rights as Medford citizens and Americans.

1320
01:43:02,323 --> 01:43:07,946
To ensure the impact of our voices be heard after speaking up for a year but not being listened to.

1321
01:43:08,666 --> 01:43:14,510
To remind people that we live in a country where inalienable human rights are protected under the Constitution of the United States.

1322
01:43:15,751 --> 01:43:22,395
I just wanna say, I know you guys don't have any power to help really with this Columbus name change, we understand that.

1323
01:43:23,338 --> 01:43:25,320
We've been pleading, you've been emailed.

1324
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,481
It's not, you know, it's not that.

1325
01:43:28,542 --> 01:43:31,844
Nobody's taking charge of the bad that's going on in the city.

1326
01:43:32,025 --> 01:43:36,148
And I mean, a few people have spoke to it tonight, but it's, I think we've reached the breaking point.

1327
01:43:36,188 --> 01:43:39,390
Like I said, we come to you because we don't know where else to go.

1328
01:43:40,351 --> 01:43:44,554
So that's the reason that we're here to speak to you guys tonight, you know, and thanks for your time.

1329
01:43:44,894 --> 01:43:49,217
Thank you, Nidhi.

1330
01:43:49,538 --> 01:43:50,859
Mr. Scogno, you have your hand up.

1331
01:43:50,899 --> 01:43:51,439
Did you want to speak?

1332
01:43:53,159 --> 01:43:59,441
And, every did you want to speak, Mr. Clay, you know, could you hear me now.

1333
01:44:00,121 --> 01:44:01,662
Yes, I name an address of the record please.

1334
01:44:02,202 --> 01:44:04,702
Emery cuneo at 71 Felsway Medford.

1335
01:44:05,643 --> 01:44:12,585
Um, I wasn't able to come down tonight and I had no intention actually of speaking, however, watching this meeting.

1336
01:44:14,911 --> 01:44:22,657
I have to say how disheartening I am, not with not with the with the city council but in general, what's going on in our city.

1337
01:44:24,438 --> 01:44:25,839
As a former school committee member.

1338
01:44:26,379 --> 01:44:27,720
When I started years ago.

1339
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:36,047
The first thing I really challenged myself and making sure that we'd work on is bullying and the bullying one.

1340
01:44:36,867 --> 01:44:59,898
the internet, and we had many forums with many people, whether it be students or adults, police chief, police, we had experts from Bridgewater, and really felt better about those, those, not those rallies, those conferences with everybody and those meetings with everyone.

1341
01:45:00,678 --> 01:45:03,559
But I have to say, I feel like we've gone backwards.

1342
01:45:03,639 --> 01:45:05,920
It's not the children that we have to worry about.

1343
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:08,381
It is the adults that we have to worry about.

1344
01:45:09,242 --> 01:45:14,004
And unfortunately, we're the models for our children.

1345
01:45:14,164 --> 01:45:27,950
So what we do, what we say, how we say it, how we act, how we attack people on Facebook or any type of social media, it's something that our kids see.

1346
01:45:28,827 --> 01:45:35,571
Now, I don't plan on speaking on a lot of the things that everybody else has touched upon, but I will speak on a couple of things.

1347
01:45:36,251 --> 01:45:40,133
And that is one, Gene Barry, Sutherland.

1348
01:45:41,494 --> 01:45:44,296
Whether or not you know this person,

1349
01:45:45,493 --> 01:45:49,214
which I did and I respected and I still respect.

1350
01:45:49,294 --> 01:45:55,895
And now knowing her rest of the family still have the respect for, but that doesn't make a difference.

1351
01:45:56,395 --> 01:46:03,477
The difference is, is that you have a person who has family in the city, who has given a lot to this city.

1352
01:46:04,217 --> 01:46:09,818
No one has the right to speak and throw things out about someone.

1353
01:46:10,963 --> 01:46:17,750
What kills me is the fact that people that are writing are the ones that are saying we shouldn't act like this.

1354
01:46:19,051 --> 01:46:26,658
Now, with that being said, as an Italian, so far now, I've been called a cheater.

1355
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:30,101
I've been called other names.

1356
01:46:31,383 --> 01:46:35,466
Growing up in this city changed a lot of that.

1357
01:46:36,371 --> 01:46:48,719
because we became evolved and like we expected to respect everyone, we don't pick and choose which nationality we are going to respect.

1358
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:52,161
We respect all nationalities.

1359
01:46:52,981 --> 01:47:05,129
From an Italian who was bullied when she was in school, where my name was changed because I was an Italian, and over the years finally get respect that we are all being treated equally,

1360
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,269
That was wonderful.

1361
01:47:09,111 --> 01:47:15,076
And now to hear that if I'm Italian, I need to be quiet or I am now accused as a cheater.

1362
01:47:15,476 --> 01:47:26,287
I would love to know that if I wrote something like that about someone else from a different type of culture or a different nationality or a different group,

1363
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:33,252
If it would've been just thrown under the rug, shoved under the rug, and hey, it is what it is.

1364
01:47:34,472 --> 01:47:50,036
If we are going to advocate for diversity, and if we are going to advocate for fairness in this city, it has to start with all nationalities, all cultures.

1365
01:47:51,737 --> 01:47:52,397
And you know,

1366
01:47:53,676 --> 01:48:17,994
Heard something a few weeks ago, and I know but I think that I'm crazy but The thing that I heard was actually on It was on the Oscars and it was from Mr. Perry who received a humanitarian award and what I loved about what he said, and I truly believe this is that he said

1367
01:48:19,074 --> 01:48:24,697
We, in our hearts, do not have room for hate.

1368
01:48:25,757 --> 01:48:34,642
We do not have room for hate for Asians, or blacks, or whites, or police officers, or anyone.

1369
01:48:35,983 --> 01:48:37,864
We need to come to a middle.

1370
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:40,205
Well, I believe there's someone else.

1371
01:48:40,505 --> 01:48:42,446
I don't know why I have someone else on my screen.

1372
01:48:45,954 --> 01:48:48,197
What we need to do is we need to get the city down.

1373
01:48:49,218 --> 01:48:58,930
Not in the things of what we believe or who believes, but back in the middle to understand what the city's about.

1374
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:01,132
And I'm sorry, but I can't see the screen.

1375
01:49:01,152 --> 01:49:03,956
I actually see someone else on it.

1376
01:49:05,848 --> 01:49:10,811
But what I'm trying to say is we need to come to the middle, okay?

1377
01:49:11,191 --> 01:49:17,335
We're not saying because you're here so many years that you have a right to speak above someone else.

1378
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:20,738
What we're saying is let's talk together.

1379
01:49:21,878 --> 01:49:30,724
And it seems to me that the groups that are coming in contradict each other because they're treating each other like the ones that they're accusing other groups of being.

1380
01:49:32,721 --> 01:49:33,641
It's frustrating.

1381
01:49:34,021 --> 01:49:47,385
And now the latest I heard is for certain people that want to make sure that we, as when we present ourselves at a podium, are not supposed to say that we're lifelong citizens or residents of the city of Medford.

1382
01:49:47,745 --> 01:49:48,966
I don't know about anyone else.

1383
01:49:49,906 --> 01:49:50,887
But I'm proud of it.

1384
01:49:51,507 --> 01:49:52,487
I have grown up here.

1385
01:49:52,607 --> 01:49:54,748
I have chose to stay here.

1386
01:49:55,089 --> 01:49:58,911
I have chosen to keep my children and raise my children here.

1387
01:49:59,271 --> 01:50:00,371
It is not a disease.

1388
01:50:00,391 --> 01:50:01,912
It is not a leprosy.

1389
01:50:02,592 --> 01:50:03,373
It is a right.

1390
01:50:03,573 --> 01:50:07,055
And I want to be proud of I am an Italian American.

1391
01:50:07,455 --> 01:50:10,136
And yes, I am proud to say that I come from Fredford.

1392
01:50:11,077 --> 01:50:13,498
But I am not proud of where method is going.

1393
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:17,400
Thank you, Mr.

1394
01:50:23,752 --> 01:50:26,714
David McKillop 94 Rockland Road.

1395
01:50:27,515 --> 01:50:31,538
I did speak to the city council on zoom about this issue.

1396
01:50:32,058 --> 01:50:34,280
I'm sure some of you might be might have been aware of it.

1397
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:40,624
And I found not sure shy of begging them to just table the issue.

1398
01:50:40,984 --> 01:50:43,626
So we could have the time to absorb what was going on.

1399
01:50:44,347 --> 01:50:46,008
And I was met with complete silence.

1400
01:50:46,569 --> 01:50:51,132
Hence the reason why I came to the city council and spoke to the city council in a level of frustration

1401
01:50:51,740 --> 01:51:01,024
which today I probably apologize for because I know you physically can't do anything about changing the name, but there is something you can do.

1402
01:51:01,544 --> 01:51:02,504
There is something.

1403
01:51:03,685 --> 01:51:21,452
If these schools are asking and pairing up with stop and shop or some of these other places for money to raise money for the school, and yet we are spending money on changing a name when we don't need to be doing that, it's a budget issue.

1404
01:51:22,459 --> 01:51:24,242
and you folks sign off on the budget.

1405
01:51:25,003 --> 01:51:31,251
So maybe there's an area there that you can hold the city council accountable for.

1406
01:51:31,832 --> 01:51:38,542
Because if they're wasting money on changing a name, which could be tens of thousands of dollars or thousands of dollars, or whatever the cost may be,

1407
01:51:39,082 --> 01:51:42,223
You folks could actually sit there and say, hey, put the brakes on.

1408
01:51:42,623 --> 01:51:48,104
You got people out there begging people for, you're selling mattresses, you're buying cookies, you're doing this, you're doing that.

1409
01:51:48,125 --> 01:51:49,845
These kids have no paper, they have no pens.

1410
01:51:50,405 --> 01:51:58,227
We're begging everybody for money, but we can spend money on a change of a sign.

1411
01:51:58,387 --> 01:52:00,748
Mrs. Cuno said, we need to bring Medford back.

1412
01:52:00,808 --> 01:52:01,828
No, Medford's here.

1413
01:52:02,308 --> 01:52:03,689
Medford's right here.

1414
01:52:04,429 --> 01:52:08,050
Every single one of the Medford society citizens are right here.

1415
01:52:08,994 --> 01:52:10,175
They're talking to you.

1416
01:52:10,575 --> 01:52:11,336
They're begging.

1417
01:52:11,496 --> 01:52:12,156
I'm begging.

1418
01:52:12,416 --> 01:52:14,357
I mean, I don't even want to wear this mask.

1419
01:52:14,918 --> 01:52:17,339
We need to stand up and say enough is enough.

1420
01:52:17,379 --> 01:52:19,301
This community is a great community.

1421
01:52:19,821 --> 01:52:21,422
These people are great people.

1422
01:52:21,502 --> 01:52:22,523
Do we have differences?

1423
01:52:22,563 --> 01:52:24,044
Do we have problems?

1424
01:52:24,704 --> 01:52:25,725
What city doesn't?

1425
01:52:26,185 --> 01:52:30,287
Listen, folks, there's no such thing as perfect.

1426
01:52:30,968 --> 01:52:34,070
And anyone that tells you there is, they're lying.

1427
01:52:35,333 --> 01:52:45,702
There is no utopia, no society in the history of the world in human beings has ever achieved utopia.

1428
01:52:46,283 --> 01:52:48,264
There's no utopia.

1429
01:52:48,745 --> 01:53:00,175
There are only really great people trying really hard to stick together, find a way to live together, to commune together,

1430
01:53:00,584 --> 01:53:03,686
to have fun together, to grow families together.

1431
01:53:04,306 --> 01:53:05,647
That's what a community is.

1432
01:53:06,028 --> 01:53:14,513
And Medford is that community, and this is ridiculous, what we're allowing to happen in our city, and you folks should stand for it.

1433
01:53:14,933 --> 01:53:15,374
Thank you.

1434
01:53:15,634 --> 01:53:23,078
Thank you.

1435
01:53:23,179 --> 01:53:26,901
If anyone else, if anyone else, did we already get anyone else?

1436
01:53:27,928 --> 01:53:30,309
I just want to follow up with what Dave just said.

1437
01:53:30,369 --> 01:53:31,250
I sent an email.

1438
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:32,110
Name and address of the records.

1439
01:53:32,710 --> 01:53:38,433
Name is John Petrella, 61 Locust Street, lifelong resident.

1440
01:53:39,773 --> 01:53:40,914
Proud to say it again.

1441
01:53:42,695 --> 01:53:44,376
I just want to follow up with David.

1442
01:53:44,516 --> 01:53:47,517
I sent an email requesting information about the cost.

1443
01:53:48,778 --> 01:53:53,320
I don't know what's going on with it, but I had to go through Captain Kress.

1444
01:53:55,354 --> 01:54:00,096
Who by the way, I don't know about anyone else, but I don't, I refer it to the school committee.

1445
01:54:00,136 --> 01:54:09,300
She is in no way part of, as far as I'm concerned, she's spoken up and she's done, I think she's done a great job.

1446
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:11,261
Probably the only one.

1447
01:54:12,481 --> 01:54:19,684
But anyhow, the message I got was, this was from Catherine and she got it from the mayor.

1448
01:54:20,444 --> 01:54:23,906
John McLaughlin responded that a sign

1449
01:54:24,602 --> 01:54:27,724
just the sign could cost upwards of $15,000.

1450
01:54:29,364 --> 01:54:44,312
So I just thought I'd let you know that that's an email, you can have a copy if you want, but I've tried to get more information, but I guess they're not too concerned with, you know, what the total cost is going to be.

1451
01:54:44,852 --> 01:54:48,133
And the only other thing, I don't know how,

1452
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:54,251
politics, city politics, what you can and can't do.

1453
01:54:54,291 --> 01:54:56,493
I keep hearing can't, can't, can't.

1454
01:54:57,593 --> 01:55:01,096
I guess you can't, but why can't we?

1455
01:55:02,817 --> 01:55:05,739
I mean, do we have to go to the clerk?

1456
01:55:05,779 --> 01:55:07,039
Can we get a petition?

1457
01:55:07,099 --> 01:55:16,946
Can we get in the city something going to stop this proceeding with this Columbus school renaming committee to put an end to it?

1458
01:55:18,858 --> 01:55:24,965
I mean, especially with what's happened, there's gotta be, can't someone do a motion?

1459
01:55:25,045 --> 01:55:26,627
Can't something happen?

1460
01:55:27,047 --> 01:55:28,669
You guys can't even do a motion.

1461
01:55:30,150 --> 01:55:35,556
The same council of method can't put forward a motion to stop.

1462
01:55:37,418 --> 01:55:38,760
You can't put it on the ballot.

1463
01:55:39,694 --> 01:55:43,698
That's, even if it's non-binding, I'm asking a question.

1464
01:55:43,738 --> 01:55:47,201
We can't put it on, I'm not, listen, I understand.

1465
01:55:47,221 --> 01:55:49,002
Point of information, Vice President Knight.

1466
01:55:49,142 --> 01:55:54,907
This council stated time and time again that this is a school committee issue and it's not something we're gonna interject ourselves to get in the middle of.

1467
01:55:54,927 --> 01:55:58,330
I mean, we've all said that on numerous occasions since this thing has started.

1468
01:55:58,370 --> 01:56:00,452
It's a school committee issue, all right?

1469
01:56:00,752 --> 01:56:02,974
So let me finish, let me finish.

1470
01:56:02,994 --> 01:56:04,576
The school committee's made their mind up, all right?

1471
01:56:04,956 --> 01:56:06,357
The horse is out of the bind.

1472
01:56:06,417 --> 01:56:07,378
It's already running around the track.

1473
01:56:08,389 --> 01:56:08,689
Okay.

1474
01:56:09,009 --> 01:56:10,030
It's already running around the track.

1475
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:10,910
The horse is out of the back.

1476
01:56:11,571 --> 01:56:12,231
You're going backwards.

1477
01:56:12,351 --> 01:56:13,632
You got to focus on moving forward.

1478
01:56:14,112 --> 01:56:14,332
All right.

1479
01:56:14,352 --> 01:56:15,233
The name is going to get changed.

1480
01:56:15,253 --> 01:56:17,194
The school committee already voted for it.

1481
01:56:17,234 --> 01:56:18,334
You've asked for reconsideration.

1482
01:56:18,354 --> 01:56:21,196
They said, no, I'm not questioning their scope and their authority.

1483
01:56:21,536 --> 01:56:21,836
All right.

1484
01:56:22,076 --> 01:56:27,039
So, I mean, ultimately that's like the school committee coming and telling us every other week, do something different, do something different.

1485
01:56:27,299 --> 01:56:30,681
You know, we got to let them operate in this, in this sphere, in their world.

1486
01:56:31,101 --> 01:56:32,241
I'm not questioning you.

1487
01:56:32,341 --> 01:56:33,302
I'm not questioning.

1488
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:35,811
anything that you just said.

1489
01:56:35,951 --> 01:56:37,792
You know what I'm saying?

1490
01:56:37,812 --> 01:56:40,854
We're not looking to necessarily start the name change.

1491
01:56:48,462 --> 01:56:49,543
You guys can't do it.

1492
01:56:49,563 --> 01:56:53,064
I mean, I don't think I mean, I don't think there's anybody that's going to agree that was a good process.

1493
01:56:53,324 --> 01:56:54,585
The process was flawed from the start.

1494
01:56:54,605 --> 01:56:55,425
It's been a disaster.

1495
01:56:55,785 --> 01:56:58,926
Quite frankly, the city would be in a much better place if this was handled differently.

1496
01:56:59,226 --> 01:57:00,987
I agree with you 150% and we have 150% this was a disaster.

1497
01:57:01,227 --> 01:57:05,069
And we appreciate hearing that from you and I know a lot of the other counselors agree with you.

1498
01:57:05,089 --> 01:57:06,269
But I mean, I don't

1499
01:57:17,577 --> 01:57:18,958
I don't know, I'm at a loss here.

1500
01:57:19,839 --> 01:57:30,608
I mean, to me, this is just, it's sad that this school committee and the committee that they assigned,

1501
01:57:32,109 --> 01:57:34,231
is going to get away with this.

1502
01:57:34,431 --> 01:57:38,294
I mean, it's a- With all due respect, I share your frustration.

1503
01:57:38,554 --> 01:57:44,019
When I think about frustration, I think about a $5 million structural deficit that we have coming up in the next year's fiscal budget.

1504
01:57:44,359 --> 01:57:46,240
Those are the things that give me anxiety at night.

1505
01:57:46,621 --> 01:57:48,142
Those are the things that I lose sleep over.

1506
01:57:48,302 --> 01:57:50,744
I'm not questioning you guys have a tough job.

1507
01:57:50,784 --> 01:57:51,905
No one's questioning that.

1508
01:57:51,985 --> 01:57:53,046
We know what's coming up.

1509
01:57:53,086 --> 01:57:57,189
We know it's a tough year with the budget and we know everything else, but,

1510
01:57:58,931 --> 01:58:05,793
you know, just to have this procedure, it's just that it breaks my heart that this is going to happen and that's all.

1511
01:58:06,053 --> 01:58:12,476
I guess what I'm getting at is in the grand scheme of things, out of all the issues and problems that we have in this community, this is one, but there are bigger ones.

1512
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,656
There are much bigger ones.

1513
01:58:13,936 --> 01:58:15,717
There are much larger problems that we have in this community.

1514
01:58:15,737 --> 01:58:22,299
Like are we meeting our new growth figures so that we can just meet the inflation and the contractual obligations that we have

1515
01:58:22,953 --> 01:58:24,294
for collective bargaining agreements.

1516
01:58:24,634 --> 01:58:26,136
These are big questions.

1517
01:58:26,176 --> 01:58:27,077
These are big questions.

1518
01:58:27,117 --> 01:58:33,822
Quite frankly, the process surrounding the school renaming did nothing to bring this city together to put us in a better position to answer them.

1519
01:58:33,862 --> 01:58:38,966
Let me get an argument from anyone in the city about that.

1520
01:58:39,006 --> 01:58:40,448
We appreciate you guys.

1521
01:58:40,508 --> 01:58:46,593
And like I said, we know what you do, but understand the frustration

1522
01:58:47,385 --> 01:58:51,748
And us knowing that this is, I mean, it's a scam is what it is.

1523
01:58:52,148 --> 01:58:54,790
They're pulling off a scam.

1524
01:58:54,890 --> 01:58:57,751
I hate to say it, but that's what it is, you know?

1525
01:58:58,152 --> 01:59:00,273
Horrible words to use, really.

1526
01:59:00,553 --> 01:59:01,834
And I don't like using them.

1527
01:59:01,954 --> 01:59:03,635
But that's basically what they're doing.

1528
01:59:03,655 --> 01:59:05,456
So there's nothing we can do.

1529
01:59:05,856 --> 01:59:06,977
Nothing we can do.

1530
01:59:06,997 --> 01:59:08,978
Thank you.

1531
01:59:10,779 --> 01:59:12,120
Jean, your name and address on the record, please.

1532
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:13,501
My name's Jean Nuzzo.

1533
01:59:13,541 --> 01:59:15,042
I live at 35 Parris Street.

1534
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:21,252
I'm a proud lifelong Redford resident, a first generation Italian American.

1535
01:59:21,492 --> 01:59:26,174
My dad came to this country with lint in his pocket and a recipe for rock soup.

1536
01:59:26,634 --> 01:59:30,015
And he and my mom carved out a wonderful life for our family.

1537
01:59:30,415 --> 01:59:31,456
And I'm grateful for that.

1538
01:59:32,016 --> 01:59:33,857
I'm also Native American.

1539
01:59:34,597 --> 01:59:35,697
You might not know that about me.

1540
01:59:36,077 --> 01:59:38,958
So that is my background that I approached this issue with.

1541
01:59:39,979 --> 01:59:42,940
I'm really saddened by what is going on in our city.

1542
01:59:43,660 --> 02:00:12,145
and specifically with this issue, because although it may have begun as a political issue, we did have a moment when the committee was pulled together and brought together under their committee of the whole in their school committee meeting, where they could have risen above the politics of it and used it as an opportunity to join our community together, to look for opportunities to help the community learn about people like June Barry Sullivan.

1543
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:17,693
who I knew not very much about because I didn't have the privilege of attending any of her classes.

1544
02:00:18,314 --> 02:00:28,961
And many of the other 18 plus people that were put forth as potential nominees for the position or the honor of having the building named.

1545
02:00:29,542 --> 02:00:39,709
We could have had a situation where that committee crafted a schedule by which they could have provided us information about the candidates for naming.

1546
02:00:41,233 --> 02:00:44,575
additional information about the 18 people who were selected.

1547
02:00:45,015 --> 02:00:51,518
We could have had a lovely event and a lovely time period where we discussed it as a community.

1548
02:00:51,958 --> 02:00:56,180
We voted on it, and we found a way to celebrate when we renamed the building.

1549
02:00:56,700 --> 02:00:57,821
But we didn't do that.

1550
02:00:58,301 --> 02:01:09,086
It remained political, and it remained political because a handful of people are using their political will, regardless of what they're being told by their constituents.

1551
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:24,581
And while I agree through the chair with Councillor Knight, that we have grave concerns about our budget, the essence of what makes our government, our government is that it is by, of, and for the people.

1552
02:01:25,182 --> 02:01:34,848
Not five people on street, not seven people on city council, not one person in the mayor's office, but every last one of us.

1553
02:01:35,468 --> 02:01:38,450
And unless and until we can find a way

1554
02:01:38,950 --> 02:01:52,458
to come together to the middle and talk about what is best, what is right, what is fair, what is just, what is equitable, and what is equity in an honest and sincere way.

1555
02:01:53,339 --> 02:02:01,764
Through empathy and compassion and trying to understand one another, we are never, never going to move past where we are.

1556
02:02:02,685 --> 02:02:08,288
I'm going to be where I've always been, in the middle, trying to be the person that sees it from both sides.

1557
02:02:08,853 --> 02:02:10,295
I would hope that you all do that.

1558
02:02:10,675 --> 02:02:15,260
And I would hope that, although you may not be able to do something about it from behind this rail.

1559
02:02:15,715 --> 02:02:28,198
you will talk to your fellow members of our municipality and have some conversations with them about a way to move forward in a manner that helps us to heal, because we still can do that.

1560
02:02:28,558 --> 02:02:35,539
There is nothing about the date that was selected, other than the school committee decided that's when it needs to be.

1561
02:02:35,899 --> 02:02:44,781
There is no reason why as a community, we cannot decide to pump the brakes on this and really find a mechanism to move forward

1562
02:02:45,148 --> 02:02:49,190
where we rise up above it and use it as an opportunity to come together.

1563
02:02:49,610 --> 02:02:59,715
Because what I can tell you about Italian-Americans growing up in Italian-American homes is that we would never want to do something that hurts another person.

1564
02:03:00,727 --> 02:03:09,310
We would never want to step on another's right because we, in the past, have been considered non-white and treated badly.

1565
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:19,834
It's not the first time people have called Italian-Americans crooks and criminals, and it won't be the last time unless we all rise up together and demand better of this community.

1566
02:03:20,274 --> 02:03:21,335
I thank you for your time.

1567
02:03:22,335 --> 02:03:22,655
Thank you.

1568
02:03:22,675 --> 02:03:25,336
Thank you, Mr. President.

1569
02:03:28,337 --> 02:03:30,098
First, I want to thank Mr. Sutherland

1570
02:03:31,505 --> 02:03:32,866
Mr. Barry's family.

1571
02:03:33,846 --> 02:03:43,289
Many of the stories you've told tonight remind me of my time at the Davenport, the Hervey the Brooks, and the educators I have had in my life they brought me where I am now.

1572
02:03:44,489 --> 02:03:49,591
And then I've brought generations of students in this community to successful and wonderful lives.

1573
02:03:50,331 --> 02:03:57,153
So, I don't want to intercede on the as a city council or the business of the school committee or make a statement on the

1574
02:03:58,082 --> 02:04:02,165
renaming of the school because I think as my fellow counselors have said we don't have authority on the matter.

1575
02:04:03,446 --> 02:04:19,696
Separately, I do want to say something about one statement tonight, a timeline and a political statement about racism that was made tonight that wasn't related to what we're talking about around the school renaming that doesn't reflect the reality we face racism is a problem across the country.

1576
02:04:20,197 --> 02:04:21,558
And yes, even here in Medford.

1577
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:32,310
You may not want to hear it, but when we deny systemic racism, we ignore and erase the daily experiences of many Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American people in our city.

1578
02:04:33,111 --> 02:04:40,258
Dr. King was quoted, as has been quoted many times to justify not talking about racism.

1579
02:04:40,779 --> 02:04:42,801
In that same speech that he made in 1963, he said,

1580
02:04:44,903 --> 02:04:50,604
We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.

1581
02:04:51,325 --> 02:04:57,846
This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or taking the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.

1582
02:04:58,286 --> 02:05:03,967
Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.

1583
02:05:05,048 --> 02:05:10,389
Inalienable human rights were brought up tonight, and for some people in our community, they aren't being protected.

1584
02:05:11,097 --> 02:05:13,419
The idea of being treated equally has come up tonight.

1585
02:05:13,879 --> 02:05:17,342
And for some people in our community, that's not their reality.

1586
02:05:17,702 --> 02:05:20,705
For people experiencing racism, it is a big deal.

1587
02:05:21,645 --> 02:05:26,469
As Councilor Mark said, sometimes in a public forum, things are said that people don't wanna hear.

1588
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:29,131
I know some people don't wanna hear what I'm saying.

1589
02:05:29,492 --> 02:05:33,695
I've sat here and respectfully heard what you've said, and I hope you'll take consideration of what I'm saying.

1590
02:05:34,718 --> 02:05:38,979
We have an obligation to take action and an honest look at history and at racism.

1591
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:43,341
We will never have true unity without truth and reconciliation.

1592
02:05:44,241 --> 02:05:48,222
It's not time to make national political statements like racism isn't a problem here.

1593
02:05:48,763 --> 02:05:54,704
It is a time for us to be honest and true with each other and take action to address the problems that I hear about every day.

1594
02:05:55,165 --> 02:05:59,486
And that deeply saddened me, I think in the way that many of you feel deeply saddened by what you

1595
02:06:00,053 --> 02:06:01,134
are here to talk about.

1596
02:06:01,394 --> 02:06:05,076
So again, thank you, Mr. Sutherland, to the Berry family.

1597
02:06:06,517 --> 02:06:16,462
What I just said was not in relation to anything about that or the Columbus School, but to a specific statement I made about the timeline of what's happened in our community over the last two years.

1598
02:06:16,882 --> 02:06:17,242
Thank you.

1599
02:06:17,523 --> 02:06:18,603
Thank you, Councilor Beza.

1600
02:06:18,743 --> 02:06:20,704
Nicole DeMonica, do you have your hand up?

1601
02:06:22,005 --> 02:06:24,266
Yes, hello, how are you?

1602
02:06:24,286 --> 02:06:25,467
My name's Nicole DeMonica.

1603
02:06:26,287 --> 02:06:27,248
Name and address, please.

1604
02:06:29,021 --> 02:06:33,383
Yes, it's Nicole DeMonica and it's 51 Burnside Street.

1605
02:06:34,203 --> 02:06:36,404
And again, I'm a lifelong resident.

1606
02:06:36,644 --> 02:06:39,065
I've been in Medford my whole entire life.

1607
02:06:39,285 --> 02:06:44,788
I worked in the medical field in Medford for the last 20 years and I played sports.

1608
02:06:45,068 --> 02:06:46,288
My children is in Medford.

1609
02:06:47,189 --> 02:06:48,089
Everything is about me.

1610
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:49,590
It's been about Medford forever.

1611
02:06:51,057 --> 02:07:01,099
First of all, I want to say is we do appreciate all what you have been doing and we know that it's not your job and this might be frustrating to you.

1612
02:07:01,959 --> 02:07:05,240
So I do want to say that we really do appreciate your help in this.

1613
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:14,442
The reason why we did have to come to you is because we are hurt and we don't know what else to do and we're just coming to you because we want your help.

1614
02:07:15,262 --> 02:07:33,176
You know, so much has happened over the last year and so much stuff has been disheartening that we're at the point where now it's causing such a roughness and people are being talked about, councilmen are being talked about, you know, people, deceased people are being talked about.

1615
02:07:34,197 --> 02:07:37,343
that have done nothing but good to the community.

1616
02:07:37,864 --> 02:07:39,327
It's just gone too far.

1617
02:07:40,749 --> 02:07:46,700
But I do want to let you know that we really do appreciate your help and we know that it's not your job.

1618
02:07:47,709 --> 02:07:58,616
What I do want to also point out is what Adam said, is that you said that the process of name change is happening and that the city, you basically have to let the city council do their job.

1619
02:07:58,916 --> 02:08:00,698
I mean, the school committee do their job.

1620
02:08:01,238 --> 02:08:08,042
And I understand that, you know, as much as I didn't agree with the name change and, you know, I don't want it.

1621
02:08:08,923 --> 02:08:11,585
I agreed, I said, okay, it's happening, we're gonna do it.

1622
02:08:12,265 --> 02:08:15,548
So I even, you know, signed up to be on the committee.

1623
02:08:15,729 --> 02:08:16,690
I didn't get chosen.

1624
02:08:16,970 --> 02:08:20,233
Other people got chosen, you know, that lived there for about a year.

1625
02:08:21,775 --> 02:08:22,876
And that was fine.

1626
02:08:23,416 --> 02:08:27,600
So we went on and people have voted, you know, multiple people have voted.

1627
02:08:27,981 --> 02:08:30,043
It's not just the Italian community either.

1628
02:08:30,563 --> 02:08:31,324
Self-Method is

1629
02:08:32,505 --> 02:08:34,066
Multiple different nationalities.

1630
02:08:34,467 --> 02:08:46,675
It's just it's italian community, but that doesn't mean just italian people live there So when you sit when people are now saying after you know, people have put the time in they voted now Even though we didn't want the name change.

1631
02:08:46,715 --> 02:08:48,497
We said, okay, we're going with the process.

1632
02:08:48,537 --> 02:08:51,539
We're letting the student council Do their job.

1633
02:08:51,879 --> 02:08:54,161
I mean the school committee do their job, right?

1634
02:08:54,181 --> 02:08:54,681
We're doing it.

1635
02:08:54,741 --> 02:08:55,302
Like you said

1636
02:08:56,102 --> 02:09:05,348
Now we all did that and now we're being called cheaters and we're being talked about the deceased and council members are being talked about as well.

1637
02:09:05,368 --> 02:09:09,511
I mean, where do you what do you want us to do now?

1638
02:09:09,931 --> 02:09:12,112
We've basically done everything that we can.

1639
02:09:13,273 --> 02:09:16,536
I mean, look at Jean Barry, 114 to like two.

1640
02:09:17,157 --> 02:09:20,299
I mean, I mean, why are we even still talking about this?

1641
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:24,023
It goes back to even the petition that we had signed up.

1642
02:09:24,383 --> 02:09:28,907
You know, there was like over 1300 people that didn't want the name change.

1643
02:09:29,107 --> 02:09:34,472
And then we had about 300 people that were okay for the name change and they weren't even from.

1644
02:09:36,093 --> 02:09:38,435
So right there that was just one part.

1645
02:09:38,555 --> 02:09:46,843
Okay, the name changed more than method residents didn't want it now this gene Barry 114 to like 4 and 20 and now we're being called cheaters and and scammers.

1646
02:09:46,863 --> 02:09:47,444
I mean

1647
02:09:52,668 --> 02:09:56,129
This is where we're asking you because now we've done our job.

1648
02:09:56,209 --> 02:10:04,912
We follow the steps We've done what we need to do, but now they're still Basically trying to hurt us and now talking about our community.

1649
02:10:05,653 --> 02:10:06,713
I come from my parents.

1650
02:10:06,893 --> 02:10:20,018
I'm the first generation here I lost my parents when I was a child So when you have people now talking about the Italian community the way they are and

1651
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:22,160
It is, it is hurtful.

1652
02:10:25,961 --> 02:10:29,582
So I just want to know what can you do to help us?

1653
02:10:29,722 --> 02:10:30,622
Can you do anything?

1654
02:10:31,622 --> 02:10:32,002
That's all.

1655
02:10:33,483 --> 02:10:40,544
This is a school community matter has been alluded to several times this evening.

1656
02:10:41,904 --> 02:10:43,185
I'm Nicole and I go way back.

1657
02:10:43,345 --> 02:10:44,265
We went to high school together.

1658
02:10:46,317 --> 02:10:48,261
I have a question, because I'm not following.

1659
02:10:48,742 --> 02:10:50,666
People said something, this, that.

1660
02:10:51,448 --> 02:10:53,372
I don't pay too much attention to the social media stuff.

1661
02:10:53,793 --> 02:10:54,534
Well, Adam, you should.

1662
02:10:56,744 --> 02:10:58,685
said a lot about you a lot.

1663
02:10:59,386 --> 02:11:02,028
So you have to go on social media to find that.

1664
02:11:03,709 --> 02:11:06,971
But with that being said, who made these comments?

1665
02:11:07,011 --> 02:11:08,713
Was it a was it a member of the committee?

1666
02:11:08,773 --> 02:11:13,356
Was it someone as a member of the committee, and this the member of this committee, I'm not going to say the name.

1667
02:11:13,756 --> 02:11:15,618
But this is a two people that

1668
02:11:16,318 --> 02:11:19,321
Their husband in white they shouldn't have been on the committee in the first place.

1669
02:11:19,801 --> 02:11:32,974
This is someone that's very biased and very one-sided and very Vocal very verbally vocal saying people have abuse problems have alcohol problems have addiction problems You know italians are racist and everything.

1670
02:11:33,014 --> 02:11:38,899
This person has been very very vocal and very vulgar And he's the one machine

1671
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:42,103
They're now on this advisory board.

1672
02:11:42,443 --> 02:11:44,365
So Adam, there's someone like me, you know me.

1673
02:11:45,106 --> 02:11:47,549
I've been Methodist, please support Method, everything.

1674
02:11:48,209 --> 02:11:49,131
I didn't get chosen.

1675
02:11:49,171 --> 02:11:51,713
There's other people in Method that's been living there for a whole life.

1676
02:11:52,094 --> 02:11:58,861
But then we have someone like this that's been chosen and his wife has been chosen just like other people.

1677
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:04,912
And now they're talking about us.

1678
02:12:04,952 --> 02:12:12,175
The reason why I ask is because if it's a committee member, a person was appointed to the committee, then they consider the city employee or a public employee.

1679
02:12:12,455 --> 02:12:16,217
So that person would be subject to all the rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies that are in place.

1680
02:12:16,817 --> 02:12:22,260
So if the school department has a policy for say, social media use, then the members of the committee should be subject to that.

1681
02:12:22,700 --> 02:12:27,942
If the school department has say a bullying policy for online bullying, the members of the committee should be subject to that.

1682
02:12:28,513 --> 02:12:30,194
Great, that's what i'm asking.

1683
02:12:30,274 --> 02:12:31,395
That's what I want to know.

1684
02:12:31,596 --> 02:12:37,901
How can you what we don't know this we're not educated on this information But what can we do about it?

1685
02:12:37,921 --> 02:12:39,862
Because this are there policies in there?

1686
02:12:40,143 --> 02:12:42,344
I mean, uh, is this something that can happen?

1687
02:12:42,364 --> 02:12:52,233
Because I think if any one of you sitting on that podium right now, no matter what you what politics you are What would you like whatever if you read what's been written?

1688
02:12:53,397 --> 02:13:01,919
If you did not if you thought that this was normal and this is okay Then I don't know what to say about you, you know, because this this is not normal.

1689
02:13:01,939 --> 02:13:07,900
I think anybody who reads it will know it's not right So I won't this what can we do?

1690
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:13,941
Can't that this committee obviously is not built trustworthy the people on it.

1691
02:13:13,981 --> 02:13:16,841
It's very biased The way it was just pick was very biased.

1692
02:13:17,401 --> 02:13:19,742
I mean, it's not it's the committee should be

1693
02:13:20,542 --> 02:13:45,020
Torn down and start all over because it's not It's look what they're saying now now they're saying that we're stuffing you everyone here talks about jean barry I I didn't go to I didn't have jean barry, but I know jean barry, you know, and I know that she's a good student I know all that she's done done for this to the kid the community her per family has had to sit here and basically Been told that she's a racist and she basically saying that she hits black children

1694
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:50,704
Like, who says something like that about someone who's deceased that's done so much for the community?

1695
02:13:51,164 --> 02:13:52,485
Like, that's just horrible.

1696
02:13:52,565 --> 02:13:53,345
Don't you think so?

1697
02:13:54,846 --> 02:14:01,251
I, you know, warning was that I hate to see the family be damaged by this issue because it's becoming so political.

1698
02:14:01,271 --> 02:14:02,652
Yeah, I know.

1699
02:14:04,213 --> 02:14:04,513
Thank you.

1700
02:14:04,533 --> 02:14:05,274
I appreciate it.

1701
02:14:05,294 --> 02:14:06,114
Thanks for answering my question.

1702
02:14:06,174 --> 02:14:06,635
No problem.

1703
02:14:07,175 --> 02:14:09,797
Thank you.

1704
02:14:09,837 --> 02:14:10,457
Thank you, Nicole.

1705
02:14:10,917 --> 02:14:11,398
No problem.

1706
02:14:12,799 --> 02:14:14,340
Can you give me name and address of the record?

1707
02:14:15,187 --> 02:14:15,608
Excuse me.

1708
02:14:15,908 --> 02:14:18,310
My name is Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue.

1709
02:14:19,311 --> 02:14:20,633
I didn't want to come up here to speak.

1710
02:14:21,614 --> 02:14:30,263
And I was enjoying some of the wonderful comments that were made about Sonoma, if I have the name right, and some people's concerns.

1711
02:14:31,124 --> 02:14:34,948
But through you, Mr. President, I will not sit still.

1712
02:14:36,027 --> 02:14:37,749
and get a lesson on racism.

1713
02:14:37,769 --> 02:14:39,770
I'm sick and tired of that.

1714
02:14:40,071 --> 02:14:43,594
Mr. President, I didn't say that.

1715
02:14:44,214 --> 02:14:50,560
I'm tired of listening to people deny racism, Mr. President.

1716
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:53,283
I'm tired of listening to people who I get a call, Mr. President,

1717
02:14:58,792 --> 02:15:02,554
Mr. President, I represent the people.

1718
02:15:02,674 --> 02:15:03,155
I am.

1719
02:15:03,355 --> 02:15:04,516
I am.

1720
02:15:04,776 --> 02:15:06,897
We're not going to attack any council members.

1721
02:15:07,097 --> 02:15:08,098
Mr. President, may I?

1722
02:15:08,818 --> 02:15:09,099
No.

1723
02:15:09,519 --> 02:15:09,819
Good.

1724
02:15:10,099 --> 02:15:10,379
No.

1725
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:12,901
Point of information.

1726
02:15:13,181 --> 02:15:15,403
There's no attacking any council members in this room.

1727
02:15:15,643 --> 02:15:16,683
Point of information, Mr. President.

1728
02:15:16,703 --> 02:15:17,924
Point of information, Councilor Bitz.

1729
02:15:17,984 --> 02:15:18,484
Thank you.

1730
02:15:18,925 --> 02:15:27,150
I never said we're all racists, Mr. D'Antonio, and I think it is disrespectful to people in this community who have experienced racism

1731
02:15:28,114 --> 02:15:28,814
to deny it.

1732
02:15:34,297 --> 02:15:36,918
Mr. He said there's no racism in Medford.

1733
02:15:38,659 --> 02:15:43,181
One person at the real place.

1734
02:15:43,441 --> 02:15:43,721
Thank you.

1735
02:15:43,742 --> 02:15:44,142
Thank you.

1736
02:15:44,162 --> 02:15:45,702
That's a lie.

1737
02:15:58,250 --> 02:15:58,990
I didn't say that.

1738
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:00,611
It's not a lie.

1739
02:16:00,671 --> 02:16:05,714
And if Councilor Behrs wants to misinterpret what I said, he's welcome to do that.

1740
02:16:07,214 --> 02:16:15,579
But he'll stand as someone who's willing to put a verifiable truth out there.

1741
02:16:16,019 --> 02:16:17,460
I did not say that.

1742
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:21,682
What I said was, the mayor said we're a racist city.

1743
02:16:21,962 --> 02:16:23,283
And how did we get there?

1744
02:16:24,803 --> 02:16:25,844
We are Americans.

1745
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:29,061
We don't look at race, we never did.

1746
02:16:29,081 --> 02:16:31,863
And this city is a great city.

1747
02:16:32,804 --> 02:16:39,729
We are sick and tired of being told that we are racist, you know we're not subjects were citizens.

1748
02:16:40,764 --> 02:16:43,646
And that's why we are going to stand in the breach.

1749
02:16:44,547 --> 02:16:46,148
This is a Marxist agenda.

1750
02:16:46,488 --> 02:16:47,969
Someone said that earlier.

1751
02:16:48,069 --> 02:16:49,950
It's called divide and conquer.

1752
02:16:50,811 --> 02:16:52,752
And we're not putting it up with it anymore.

1753
02:16:54,554 --> 02:16:56,395
I'm just not sure what we're going after at this point.

1754
02:16:56,435 --> 02:16:58,176
We're just engaging in open debate at this point.

1755
02:16:58,216 --> 02:16:59,557
I'm not really sure what's happening.

1756
02:17:00,838 --> 02:17:03,340
Through the chair, I can tell you what this is about.

1757
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:08,904
This is about the fact that we are sick and tired of listening to people

1758
02:17:10,458 --> 02:17:16,921
who haven't experienced half of what most of this people in this room have due to their age or their inexperience.

1759
02:17:17,421 --> 02:17:22,504
I happen to have had the great privilege to have lived for 30 years in Judge Brooks's house.

1760
02:17:22,804 --> 02:17:24,565
We bought the house from his estate.

1761
02:17:25,205 --> 02:17:28,767
He marched in Selma in his 80s.

1762
02:17:29,147 --> 02:17:31,068
That's the type of people we come from.

1763
02:17:33,367 --> 02:17:34,608
And so what's tonight about?

1764
02:17:35,309 --> 02:17:46,119
We finally got sick and tired when we found out that this person on the committee put these statements in writing that the Italians cheated.

1765
02:17:46,859 --> 02:17:47,920
That's what this is about.

1766
02:17:48,341 --> 02:17:49,382
We want to be heard.

1767
02:17:50,543 --> 02:17:52,324
We know maybe you can't do a whole lot.

1768
02:17:52,404 --> 02:17:55,267
I have a suggestion for something you could do if you wanted to.

1769
02:17:56,867 --> 02:18:06,951
Councilor Mayorko told me that four votes of this city council could put an advisory question on the ballot in November, asking if we want the name change.

1770
02:18:07,211 --> 02:18:11,813
Yes, it may be too late, but at least people would feel like they've been heard.

1771
02:18:12,093 --> 02:18:14,334
Now that's your druthers whether you wanna do it.

1772
02:18:14,514 --> 02:18:15,814
So what are we doing here today?

1773
02:18:16,075 --> 02:18:17,675
We're saying we're sick and tired.

1774
02:18:18,175 --> 02:18:22,577
We're not gonna sit here when someone says that Jean Barry maybe mistreated black children.

1775
02:18:22,757 --> 02:18:24,338
We're not gonna sit here when the Italians

1776
02:18:25,356 --> 02:18:28,957
when a man wrote on that committee that the Italians cheated.

1777
02:18:29,997 --> 02:18:35,639
Nope, we're done, we're sick of it, and we're gonna come back here every night if we have to on Tuesday nights.

1778
02:18:35,979 --> 02:18:36,599
Thank you.

1779
02:18:36,619 --> 02:18:38,020
Mr. President, point of information.

1780
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:39,580
Point of information, counselor, it is.

1781
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:44,742
The mayor said that systemic racism is a public health crisis.

1782
02:18:45,022 --> 02:18:47,222
The mayor did not say this is a racist city.

1783
02:18:47,983 --> 02:18:52,944
That is scientifically verifiable, and it is something we need to address, thank you.

1784
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:54,300
Okay.

1785
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:57,343
Yes, we said that.

1786
02:18:59,064 --> 02:19:00,486
We have other people that want to speak.

1787
02:19:00,766 --> 02:19:02,607
Let's see, we have other people that want to speak first.

1788
02:19:04,189 --> 02:19:05,430
Sharon Diesso, please.

1789
02:19:05,930 --> 02:19:07,812
Sharon Diesso, name and address of the record, please.

1790
02:19:08,893 --> 02:19:13,237
Mr. Clerk, can you unmute Sharon Diesso, please?

1791
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:18,181
Hold on, Sharon.

1792
02:19:21,184 --> 02:19:21,484
Hold on.

1793
02:19:23,078 --> 02:19:24,059
Good evening, everyone.

1794
02:19:24,099 --> 02:19:24,699
Can you hear me?

1795
02:19:25,459 --> 02:19:25,639
Yes.

1796
02:19:25,659 --> 02:19:26,780
Name and address of the record, please.

1797
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:27,560
Thank you.

1798
02:19:27,640 --> 02:19:31,342
Sharon DSO 130 Circuit Road in Mass Ave in Medford.

1799
02:19:32,123 --> 02:19:40,267
Sadly, some of the comments that are just so genuine and so sincere tonight, everything ends up again in this city, political.

1800
02:19:40,887 --> 02:19:42,989
Let's get away from the politics for a second.

1801
02:19:43,149 --> 02:19:51,373
I am in agreement in many, many people in the city with the piece that every fine speaker said tonight, a little bit from everyone's comments.

1802
02:19:51,972 --> 02:19:56,416
Thank you all for attending tonight, and thank you, council members for listening to us.

1803
02:19:57,657 --> 02:20:11,490
About four to five weeks ago, the Medford transcript in the Somerville Medford News gladly picked up and printed my article on the Columbus School, like the movie, Goodbye Columbus, Not So Fast in Medford.

1804
02:20:12,251 --> 02:20:16,575
It even got picked up, and I was a guest on Howie Carr's show about two weeks ago.

1805
02:20:17,402 --> 02:20:22,484
Howie Carr's assistant is working on getting me the name, Mr. Petrella.

1806
02:20:22,524 --> 02:20:26,506
And if you'd like to get in touch with me, I know how he's very, very busy.

1807
02:20:26,546 --> 02:20:28,867
He was quite concerned about the city of Medford.

1808
02:20:29,247 --> 02:20:30,728
We do have long standing.

1809
02:20:31,344 --> 02:20:33,866
Do people move here constantly?

1810
02:20:34,006 --> 02:20:35,547
Is the price of real estate up?

1811
02:20:35,667 --> 02:20:41,471
I ask you all, even those listening, of course, would they move here in a racist, typical city?

1812
02:20:42,252 --> 02:20:42,492
No.

1813
02:20:43,073 --> 02:20:46,715
Everyone stop this year in the events and examine their conscience.

1814
02:20:47,075 --> 02:20:48,617
I'm sure I teach.

1815
02:20:48,937 --> 02:20:51,799
I still help two marvelous principals in Medford.

1816
02:20:52,219 --> 02:20:58,604
Besides being an adjunct professor at Bunker Hill, I helped Mr. Nicholas Tucci outstanding and also

1817
02:20:59,619 --> 02:21:02,022
a principal at the high school, Mrs. Aleva.

1818
02:21:02,662 --> 02:21:07,769
I ask you, when these working people worked through the pandemic, et cetera,

1819
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:10,490
What was the school committee doing?

1820
02:21:11,070 --> 02:21:21,652
Chasing around, trying to get votes, and talking about Christopher Columbus with some facts that I'm sure none of you ever even heard about in the 40, 50, and 60 years of your lives.

1821
02:21:22,073 --> 02:21:25,893
This is what Mrs. Brady is speaking about and why we're all frustrated.

1822
02:21:26,493 --> 02:21:35,255
Mr. Carr's assistant will be looking, Mr. Petrella, for the name of the organization who helps pleas like this in other cities.

1823
02:21:35,672 --> 02:21:42,795
It was the organization that replaced the Christopher Columbus statue in the North End.

1824
02:21:43,295 --> 02:21:46,016
I am Sharon Diesso at yahoo.com.

1825
02:21:46,436 --> 02:21:49,357
I welcome your comments and thank you all for listening to us.

1826
02:21:49,857 --> 02:21:50,318
Bye bye.

1827
02:21:50,338 --> 02:21:50,898
Go USA.

1828
02:22:05,537 --> 02:22:05,797
please.

1829
02:22:06,117 --> 02:22:07,398
Thank you for coming out of your shell.

1830
02:22:07,558 --> 02:22:07,758
Yes.

1831
02:22:08,198 --> 02:22:08,398
No.

1832
02:22:12,199 --> 02:22:26,683
Every, every, every, every listen, everything, everything that counts appears always says is to the extreme is to his opinion with what he is entitled to his opinion.

1833
02:22:26,823 --> 02:22:27,403
Absolutely.

1834
02:22:28,324 --> 02:22:28,804
So are we.

1835
02:22:30,248 --> 02:22:33,030
He ends everything with white supremacists.

1836
02:22:33,451 --> 02:22:34,291
He ends everything.

1837
02:22:34,772 --> 02:22:37,594
You said that Bedford is a racist city.

1838
02:22:37,774 --> 02:22:41,897
I will, I will, I will speak to the chair.

1839
02:22:42,158 --> 02:22:44,139
Everything with him ends in white supremacists.

1840
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:49,363
I debunk everything he says and he never responds.

1841
02:22:50,024 --> 02:22:50,424
Never.

1842
02:22:50,744 --> 02:22:51,005
Okay.

1843
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,881
He puts things out there as fact.

1844
02:22:54,241 --> 02:23:03,004
I find it extremely hard to believe that a 70 year old woman was pushed to the ground in front of 25 people and nobody helped.

1845
02:23:03,404 --> 02:23:04,104
I don't buy it.

1846
02:23:04,364 --> 02:23:05,324
I just don't buy it.

1847
02:23:06,505 --> 02:23:15,648
Anything that anyone says is taken as word, put out there as extreme, and that's what critical race theory does.

1848
02:23:16,328 --> 02:23:16,608
Thank you.

1849
02:23:18,440 --> 02:23:22,804
Okay, is anyone who hasn't speaking this evening would like to speak?

1850
02:23:27,228 --> 02:23:29,170
Okay, Betsy will be the last comments.

1851
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:33,254
Okay, Betsy Rooster, Roth Street, Medford Mass.

1852
02:23:34,875 --> 02:23:42,482
I wanna say that in a world where love lives, we don't see racism, we don't know racism.

1853
02:23:43,179 --> 02:23:45,941
This community used to be filled with love.

1854
02:23:46,501 --> 02:23:52,806
It just seems that in the past 18 months that we have been divided.

1855
02:23:53,266 --> 02:23:54,907
Comments have been made.

1856
02:23:56,448 --> 02:24:01,291
Our wishes, our desires for this community have been set aside.

1857
02:24:01,832 --> 02:24:04,994
All I've heard tonight is we can't do anything.

1858
02:24:05,114 --> 02:24:06,435
We can't do anything.

1859
02:24:06,915 --> 02:24:07,696
That's wrong.

1860
02:24:08,096 --> 02:24:09,557
We can do plenty.

1861
02:24:10,478 --> 02:24:11,539
Our numbers are great.

1862
02:24:11,979 --> 02:24:13,981
We're a strong, loving community.

1863
02:24:14,281 --> 02:24:15,442
We love Medford.

1864
02:24:15,722 --> 02:24:22,208
We don't wanna see it be, and I won't name any communities that are falling apart.

1865
02:24:22,708 --> 02:24:24,730
We don't wanna fall apart.

1866
02:24:25,050 --> 02:24:26,671
We wanna come together.

1867
02:24:27,072 --> 02:24:36,319
What it feels like with the school committee is that they are dividing us and they're losing their focus.

1868
02:24:37,580 --> 02:24:39,302
Spending all this time

1869
02:24:40,059 --> 02:24:56,352
on a school name change when our kids couldn't go back to school, and I forget who mentioned about pandering for go to stop and shop one week when the kids aren't even in school they want money for hand sanitizer the next week it's for something else.

1870
02:24:56,792 --> 02:24:57,072
I mean,

1871
02:24:58,393 --> 02:24:59,394
What is going on?

1872
02:24:59,454 --> 02:25:03,557
The kids aren't even in school and they want hand sanitizer for the school.

1873
02:25:03,637 --> 02:25:04,658
It's ridiculous.

1874
02:25:05,038 --> 02:25:06,439
I mean, we're not idiots.

1875
02:25:06,779 --> 02:25:08,240
We love this community.

1876
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:14,084
We want to know that the leaders that we chose care as much about this community as we do.

1877
02:25:15,725 --> 02:25:16,786
I want to hear more.

1878
02:25:17,106 --> 02:25:18,347
We can do something.

1879
02:25:18,627 --> 02:25:19,648
We can get together.

1880
02:25:19,688 --> 02:25:20,589
We can parlay.

1881
02:25:20,649 --> 02:25:21,389
We can talk.

1882
02:25:21,429 --> 02:25:26,393
We can share our ideas and share our love and not this division.

1883
02:25:26,943 --> 02:25:28,044
That's all I have to say.

1884
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:28,325
Thank you.

1885
02:25:28,545 --> 02:25:29,146
And hatred.

1886
02:25:29,446 --> 02:25:29,867
Thank you.

1887
02:25:34,573 --> 02:25:38,418
I just want to read the excerpt that everyone's referring to just so you guys can hear it.

1888
02:25:38,938 --> 02:25:39,779
That's all I want to say.

1889
02:25:39,839 --> 02:25:42,643
So Nadine Moretti, Birgit Ave, Medford.

1890
02:25:44,038 --> 02:25:52,223
A complete lack of information about local people that aren't historically significant, Jean Barry Sutherland received by far the most suggestions by the public.

1891
02:25:52,663 --> 02:25:58,086
Also, had the most widespread cheating and was mostly made by people that didn't want the name to change.

1892
02:25:58,526 --> 02:26:01,068
So we only got positive anecdotal information.

1893
02:26:01,548 --> 02:26:04,750
We don't know if, for instance, she was awful to black students.

1894
02:26:06,107 --> 02:26:15,051
The only supporters were white, mostly Italian American, that identified that way in their submission, and many who were known members and supporters of the Medford United.

1895
02:26:15,792 --> 02:26:28,418
This is also then racism, and should come under the entire, you know, umbrella of it, that this is racism, by this renaming committee member about

1896
02:26:29,947 --> 02:26:33,108
Mrs. Sutherland and white people and Italians.

1897
02:26:33,168 --> 02:26:39,029
So that, I guess it just encompasses the entire idea of it.

1898
02:26:39,249 --> 02:26:41,909
So I just wanted you to hear that's what was written, okay?

1899
02:26:41,929 --> 02:26:42,689
You've already spoken.

1900
02:26:42,950 --> 02:26:43,630
Thank you.

1901
02:26:44,090 --> 02:26:44,410
Thank you.

1902
02:26:45,650 --> 02:26:50,591
Again, if anyone else would like to speak, if not, we'll finish the debate on this.

1903
02:26:56,071 --> 02:27:00,734
I want to thank the Barry family who I've known for over 50 years for coming up this evening.

1904
02:27:00,775 --> 02:27:02,716
Thank you for coming up and again, I thank you for coming.

1905
02:27:05,278 --> 02:27:12,523
The records of the meeting of May 4th, 2021, the table records.

1906
02:27:12,543 --> 02:27:13,524
We'll pass to Councilor Marks.

1907
02:27:13,544 --> 02:27:15,065
Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

1908
02:27:15,225 --> 02:27:18,087
Mr. President, I reviewed the records, find them to be in order and move approval.

1909
02:27:18,248 --> 02:27:19,088
Thank you.

1910
02:27:19,108 --> 02:27:21,470
The motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by?

1911
02:27:21,710 --> 02:27:22,070

1912
02:27:22,811 --> 02:27:24,112
Seconded by Vice President Knight.

1913
02:27:24,152 --> 02:27:25,293

02:27:27,099 --> 02:27:27,379
Yes.

1916
02:27:27,939 --> 02:27:28,660

Yes.

1920

Councilor Martins.

1921
02:27:31,402 --> 02:27:31,742

Yes.

Councilor Scarpelli.

1925
02:27:34,324 --> 02:27:34,565
Yes.

1926
02:27:34,585 --> 02:27:35,365
President Kerrio.

1927
02:27:35,666 --> 02:27:35,906
Yes.

1928
02:27:36,486 --> 02:27:37,227
Motion passes.

1929

The records of the May 11th, 2021 meeting is passed to Councilor Morrell.

1930
02:27:40,990 --> 02:27:42,972
Councilor Morrell, how did you find those records?

1931
02:27:43,232 --> 02:27:47,115
I found them to be in order and with approval.

1932
02:27:47,175 --> 02:27:50,858
The motion by Councilor Morrell, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1933
02:27:50,878 --> 02:27:51,939
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1934
02:27:53,497 --> 02:27:54,097
Councilor Behrs?

1935
02:27:54,337 --> 02:27:54,657
Yes.

1936
02:27:55,118 --> 02:27:55,758
Councilor Fevella?

1937
02:27:55,978 --> 02:27:56,238
Yes.

1938
02:27:56,258 --> 02:27:57,078
Vice President Knight?

1944
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:00,560
Councilor Scarpelli?

1945
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:00,940
Yes.

1946
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:01,760

1947
02:28:01,900 --> 02:28:02,100
Yes.

1948
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:02,941
Motion passed.

1949
02:28:03,241 --> 02:28:04,842
Motion to adjourn.

1950
02:28:05,002 --> 02:28:06,842
Seconded by Councilor Behrs to adjourn.

1951
02:28:06,882 --> 02:28:09,023
Seconded by Councilor Scott.

1952
02:28:09,363 --> 02:28:12,465
Mr. President, if we could.

1953
02:28:12,865 --> 02:28:13,865
Thank you, Mr. President.

1954
02:28:14,365 --> 02:28:18,687
We received in our packet our correspondence regarding resolution 21-336 from the mayor

1955
02:28:22,150 --> 02:28:36,863
This is dated May 6th, and it's regarding my resolution that was offered two weeks ago about seeing if waste management could provide the residents a service of washing or power washing their recycle and their trash bin.

1956
02:28:37,243 --> 02:28:40,286
And this is the response we received from the administration.

1957
02:28:40,686 --> 02:28:47,733
It says waste management does not have the resources to perform the requested service of washing the cots.

1958
02:28:48,897 --> 02:28:53,200
per waste management, they have not been asked to wash cots for any other community.

1959
02:28:53,700 --> 02:28:59,804
Instead, residents are instructed to rinse their cots with a hose and let dry in the sun.

1960
02:29:00,505 --> 02:29:09,190
Spraying the interior with a cleaner, like a simple green, before washing will help the cots that are excessively dirty, Mr. President.

1961
02:29:09,651 --> 02:29:17,836
So this is a multi-multi-million dollar corporation, Mr. President, that doesn't have the whereabouts on a multi-multi

1962
02:29:18,309 --> 02:29:27,934
million dollar yearly contract to assist residents on barrels that may, after many years, have a stink to them, Mr. President.

1963
02:29:28,354 --> 02:29:43,883
And you're asking senior citizens, disabled people, and other people, Mr. President, in this community, to take a barrel that's four and a half feet tall, that weighs some 35 pounds, and flip it over and wash it out, Mr. President, I think is unacceptable.

1964
02:29:44,283 --> 02:29:45,664
So I would respectfully ask

1965
02:29:46,084 --> 02:30:03,496
that the administration, where they failed to convince waste management that this is a good idea on behalf of the 58,000 residents of this community, that the city now find a contractor, Mr. President, at their dime to find out

1966
02:30:04,967 --> 02:30:15,419
who would come out and clean, Mr. President, go around like they pick up the trash, they can go around and clean these barrels up, Mr. President, on behalf of the residents of this community.

1967
02:30:15,679 --> 02:30:23,568
And I would put that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that the city seek out another vendor if waste management is not willing to do so.

1968
02:30:24,112 --> 02:30:26,854
to clean the barrels throughout the community.

1969
02:30:26,894 --> 02:30:30,097
If you can say that, but next week, we got the motion to adjourn has already been offered.

1970
02:30:30,217 --> 02:30:30,817
Mr. President.

1971
02:30:31,338 --> 02:30:32,558
Councilor Best.

1972
02:30:32,739 --> 02:30:37,202
Will the cleaning service worker, the machine they used to pick up my trash has cracked the barrel in half.

1973
02:30:38,263 --> 02:30:39,464
Cracked the barrels in half.

1974
02:30:41,065 --> 02:30:43,647
We have a lot of stuff to do with waste minutes, but I appreciate you bringing this up.

1975
02:30:44,968 --> 02:30:48,250
I will hold on to it, maybe if the motion to adjourn.

1976
02:30:48,310 --> 02:30:49,791
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

1977
02:30:50,692 --> 02:30:52,954
Councilor Behr has offered a motion, Councilor Skarpelic second.

1978
02:30:53,899 --> 02:30:55,700
The motion to adjourn by Councilor Beall.

1979
02:30:55,720 --> 02:30:56,961
Wait a second, Mr. President.

1980
02:30:57,001 --> 02:30:59,163
We do have someone that just came up that wasn't in the room.

1981
02:30:59,323 --> 02:31:00,164
I withdraw my motion.

1982
02:31:00,724 --> 02:31:01,565
Excuse me.

1983
02:31:01,605 --> 02:31:02,105
Good evening.

1984
02:31:02,125 --> 02:31:03,246
Name and address of the record, please.

1985
02:31:03,807 --> 02:31:05,208
Gwendolyn Blackburn.

1986
02:31:06,249 --> 02:31:09,791
And I know that I'm very late getting here.

1987
02:31:10,812 --> 02:31:14,976
I was late hearing what was going on at your meeting.

1988
02:31:16,056 --> 02:31:17,898
I was appalled at

1989
02:31:18,425 --> 02:31:27,690
what I was hearing was happening, talking about Jean Barry, someone that I worked with for about 40 years in the school system.

1990
02:31:28,550 --> 02:31:31,552
And I couldn't wait any longer.

1991
02:31:31,572 --> 02:31:33,493
I finally said I had to come down here.

1992
02:31:33,973 --> 02:31:35,134
And my husband said, why?

1993
02:31:35,154 --> 02:31:35,934
What are you gonna do?

1994
02:31:36,335 --> 02:31:39,456
I said, I have to go because I think this is appalling.

1995
02:31:39,916 --> 02:31:43,338
What has been apparently going on, I didn't hear anything about it.

1996
02:31:43,858 --> 02:31:45,980
I don't know if you're finished your meetings,

1997
02:31:47,424 --> 02:31:59,732
this issue on the school naming of the school or what, if there's gonna be another meeting on this topic, I would just like to know about it because I'd like to come and speak on it.

1998
02:32:00,252 --> 02:32:10,659
Because I can't believe all the Jean Barry did in this city and everything that I'm hearing what I'm hearing at your meeting.

1999
02:32:11,419 --> 02:32:15,782
So all I wanna say is, didn't sound like it was over.

2000
02:32:16,678 --> 02:32:19,780
I mean, the issue had not been decided upon.

2001
02:32:20,701 --> 02:32:26,905
And I would like very much to be on your agenda if you're going to bring it up some more.

2002
02:32:27,606 --> 02:32:35,892
Because I am hurt to think of all that Gene Berry did in this school system, in Medford, and some of the rest of us.

2003
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:38,701
Mr. President, if Ms.

2004
02:32:38,761 --> 02:32:44,304
Blackburn would be willing to speak tonight, if you want to speak tonight, I'd be more than happy to suspend the rules.

2005
02:32:44,644 --> 02:32:46,024
We are up here and allow you to speak.

2006
02:32:46,385 --> 02:32:48,485
It's up to you if you want to speak on that issue.

2007
02:32:48,926 --> 02:32:53,068
Well, I want to know, is this issue all settled now?

2008
02:32:53,688 --> 02:32:56,469
We just heard from residents, we have not settled anything.

2009
02:32:57,049 --> 02:32:58,730
I'd like to come back.

2010
02:32:58,970 --> 02:33:00,351
I don't want to take up your time.

2011
02:33:00,911 --> 02:33:04,393
I know the meeting was ending, but I have

2012
02:33:05,109 --> 02:33:19,938
a lot of things I'd like to say, as much as I worked with Jean Barry and so many people in this school system, teachers, administrators in almost 50 years.

2013
02:33:20,838 --> 02:33:29,223
And to hear what I was hearing, I just feel like I'd like to come back when you have the time and say what I have to say.

2014
02:33:31,057 --> 02:33:33,498
I don't want to take up your time, because your meeting is over.

2015
02:33:33,518 --> 02:33:35,338
But I would like to come back.

2016
02:33:37,239 --> 02:33:38,359
Ms.

2017
02:33:38,399 --> 02:33:40,480
Blackburn, you know my respect for you is to the moon.

2018
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:46,881
So you're welcome at any time during public participation, even next week, if you'd like to come.

2019
02:33:47,342 --> 02:33:50,382
We can sponsor you to come up and share your remarks.

2020
02:33:50,502 --> 02:33:52,723

2024
02:33:59,741 --> 02:34:05,923
having the forum with someone with your background and your knowledge of what goes on and what people have done in our school system.
