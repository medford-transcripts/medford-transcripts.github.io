    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=42.076">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=42.637">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=44.177">So</a>  then the first question for all my guests is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=49.22">And</a>  what do you like to eat there?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=53.281">Well,</a>  it's it's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=54.628">been</a>  used many times already on your podcast, but I have to say Goldilocks they're right up the street from me and they're just right breakfast sandwich is pretty wonderful and also their owners Lindsay and Ed are just such great people and great contributors to our community.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=70.928">So</a>  do you have a favorite bagel?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=74.424">everything</a>  bagel.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=76.486">Yeah,</a>  that's a solid choice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=78.487">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=79.728">Okay,</a>  so I know we have a lot of you're involved in a couple different art groups throughout Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=85.172">And</a>  it sounds and we talked about sort of a list of those and maybe we could start with talking about the ArtsLive Medford Foundation.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=93.757">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=94.738">So</a>  ArtsLive Medford Foundation is a private foundation started by May Mark Brecht <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=101.24">who</a>  has been involved in numerous arts organizations over the years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=106.903">And</a>  really what she saw was a need for some additional funding for our programs here in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=113.626">We</a>  have our wonderful Medford Arts Council and some other resources, but we also knew that they weren't able to fully fund all of the programs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=121.69">And</a>  also because they're part of the state's Mass Cultural Council program, they have some limitations on what they can fund. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=128.055">And</a>  so she decided to create this foundation to enable us to fund some of these additional programs.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=135.238">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=135.598">Can</a>  you give some examples of what they've funded?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=138.88">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=140.0">So</a>  we have been in existence for six years now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=144.002">And</a>  over that time, we have funded programs including MARV, the Medford Art Bus through Arts Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=152.446">We</a>  funded some programs for the Lakota Youth Stay Program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=156.949">And</a>  also there is the third grade songwriting project in some of our public schools and various musical and theatrical performances, including the Medford Jazz Festival programs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=170.567">So</a>  a real variety of programs around the city.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=173.265">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=173.865">And</a>  so the idea is like, if you have an art related project that you need help funding, you can apply to Arts Alive.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=181.488">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=182.168">And</a>  it's a pretty simple application and we fund grants anywhere from $100 to $2,000.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=188.011">Arts</a>  Alive has also helped out this podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=193.493">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=193.913">And</a>  we were happy to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=195.013">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=196.754">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=198.6">Great.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=199.02">And</a>  we're going to have some links in the show notes about sort of how people can connect to Arts Alive or find out some more information as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=205.304">But</a>  do you have any recommendations about like best ways for folks to learn more about Arts Alive?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=211.047">If</a>  you're interested in finding out more about us, you can just send us an email at artsalivemedford, that's all one word, at gmail.com. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=219.652">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=220.373">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=221.76">And</a>  you also are involved with CACHE. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=224.423">Do</a>  you want to talk a little bit about that?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=226.986">So</a>  yes, I'm the president of CACHE. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=230.109">CACHE</a>  stands for the Coalition of Arts, Culture and a Healthy Economy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=234.694">And</a>  what we are is a coalition of 24 arts, culture, history and educational organizations in the city of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=242.361">And</a>  our role is really to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=244.377">promote</a>  and amplify the visibility of the arts and our amazing cultural resources that we have in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=251.52">There's</a>  also that healthy economy element. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=254.101">Not</a>  only are the arts an economic engine, but also we work on the relationship between the business and the arts community because there's a lot that we can do to help each other and work collaboratively together.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=267.705">Yeah,</a>  what's an example of that, like a relationship between arts and business?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=273.071">Well,</a>  one of the great examples is our circle the square program which we are so excited, we're bringing back live this summer on Saturday, June 18. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=282.98">After</a>  not having it for a couple of years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=285.802">So</a>  that was really born out of, you know, a couple of people looking around Medford square and saying, we need to do something to bring people into the square get them excited about coming down to Medford square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=298.112">And</a>  so while we program arts and culture activities all the way from City Hall down to Colleen's, we also engage all of the businesses or as many as many of the businesses as we can in the square and also outside the square come and have tables at the event. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=313.524">So</a>  getting people to walk into a storefront and find out more about these businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=318.047">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=319.548">So</a>  great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=320.389">And</a>  how did you how did you become involved? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=322.19">Like</a>  what's where does your sort of passion for art come from?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=326.229">Quite</a>  honestly, I don't have a background in the arts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=330.033">I</a>  was on the board of Medford Farmers Market. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=333.576">And</a>  my friend Susan Fairchild was on the board with me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=337.979">She</a>  was involved with Caché and said, come get involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=341.883">And</a>  she was actually the spark behind the initial idea for Circle Square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=347.127">And</a>  so she brought me into Caché. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=349.049">And</a>  then over the years, my role developed with the organization.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=353.535">Yeah,</a>  I think we've been hearing like a little bit too about the connection of art in Medford and like some another sort of theme on the podcast is like inclusivity and sort of thinking about equity and I've heard about some different art popping up around the city that is sort of related to those themes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=371.109">Is</a>  that something that Cachet is involved in?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=374.659">Not</a>  those specific projects that you may be referring to, but certainly we've made specific efforts towards inclusivity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=382.906">We</a>  certainly always try to ensure that our programming and our performers represent a variety of styles and different groups of people in our community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=396.922">And</a>  also, we did have an initiative a few years ago where we went out to different segments of the population to try to engage with them because we realized, you know, this expectation of you're going to come to us and engage with the way we want to engage. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=412.429">And</a>  we went to them saying, what do you want? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=414.831">And</a>  how can we be a part of your community as opposed to just inviting you to be part of ours?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=421.149">Yeah,</a>  that's like I think a theme that I've been hearing from folks in that in these like attempts to sort of be more representative of the of the people in the city or being able to like hear what folks are wanting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=432.494">Sounds</a>  great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=434.235">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=435.175">Is</a>  there anything else about cashier that you think it's important for folks to know about?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=439.257">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=440.317">So,</a>  first of all, in addition to Circle the Square, we have our Mystic River Celebration, which is actually our original festival. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=447.759">It's</a>  at the Condon Shell every fall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=450.56">We</a>  were able to bring that back last September, and it was such a wonderful event. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=454.101">It</a>  turned out to be a perfect, beautiful day, and I think people were really eager for an opportunity to come out and be part of the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=461.423">The</a>  other thing that we do have, we have our Arts Across Medford online calendar <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=466.824">which</a>  features events just within Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=469.986">And</a>  last year we had over 1,200 events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=473.408">It</a>  includes online events as well as now increasingly going back to in-person events all around the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=479.251">So</a>  I really encourage anybody to go check that out on our website. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=482.132">It's</a>  just cacheandmedford.org. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=484.373">Or</a>  also if anybody wants to, they can go to a link on the website and sign up and get weekly email updates about all of the events coming up.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=494.62">Awesome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=494.92">Is</a>  Cache involved in like the Makerspace at all in the library? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=498.343">We</a>  are not involved in the Makerspace. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=500.084">Makerspace</a>  is part of Arts Medford, a different arts organization in the city, although we certainly have involvement together and the Makerspace has been a member of Cache.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=509.992">Oh,</a>  cool.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=511.773">Great.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=512.674">Okay,</a>  so I think our final thing that we were wanting to talk about is the the Arts Collaborative and the Medford, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=522.827">Yes,</a>  Arts Collaborative Medford is very exciting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=526.431">We</a>  are working on the creation of a community arts center in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=531.918">There</a>  have been a number of attempts over many years to create an arts center. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=537.111">and</a>  our particular group has been active since 2017. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=539.553">We</a>  have representatives of CACHE, the Medford Arts Council, Arts Medford, city personnel and officials that have been working on this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=551.122">And</a>  originally we were looking at a city-owned property over off of Fulton Street that has been vacant for a few years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=559.845">But</a>  then a year ago, we were approached with an amazing opportunity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=564.09">One</a>  of the applicants for a cannabis dispensary offered us a space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=570.698">So</a>  we are partnering with Theory Wellness, which is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=575.303">looking</a>  to open a dispensary at what was the VW dealership on Mystic Ave, right next to Atlas Liquors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=582.067">They</a>  have offered us 10,000 square feet at the front of the building, what was the showroom. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=586.63">So</a>  it would be front and center, very visible to the public, that would be our community arts center.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=593.894">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=594.415">And</a>  what's your vision for the arts center?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=599.874">It's</a>  going to be a very multi-use space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=603.235">It</a>  actually has a beautiful layout already of large and small and medium-sized spaces. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=610.157">So</a>  it's going to be a mix of studios for individual artists. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=615.158">We'll</a>  have classrooms to have classes and workshops and various presentations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=621.14">And</a>  then there is a large space that could serve for a variety of performances and events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=626.261">It</a>  will also be a gallery space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=628.928">could</a>  be a meeting space for community events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=632.178">So</a>  it's gonna have a lot of opportunity for a variety of uses.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=636.757">And</a>  it sounds like this is a plan that's like in the sort of like approval process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=641.341">Is</a>  there anything that is important for the community to know about that or how to be involved?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=646.305">We</a>  are still waiting for the final approval. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=650.128">Theory</a>  Wellness was a very strong candidate among the candidates for a dispensary license. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=655.992">And</a>  they're in the process of, we believe, finalizing their host agreement with the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=661.236">So</a>  we're just waiting for that host agreement to be signed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=663.999">And</a>  then it's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=664.819">just</a>  steaming ahead, you know, the hope is that we can open this art center by the end of this calendar year.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=671.981">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=673.041">Is</a>  it something that like public support could help you move along or is it just sort of a like process?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=679.343">You</a>  know, it never hurts, but I think, you know, certainly we've had discussions directly with the mayor and other city officials. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=686.525">They</a>  know how <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=688.345">badly</a>  we want this project to move ahead. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=691.746">So</a>  they're certainly familiar with our intentions here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=695.227">It</a>  never hurts to remind people, you know, particularly if people are enthusiastic about this project to hear that, you know, we'd love to see this happen in our city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=703.97">Yeah,</a>  is it so is it open to like kids and adults like all ages or what's the sort of exactly, you know, we're still working out the details on, you know, any specific program, but certainly it will be accessible to everybody in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=718.656">And</a>  we in particular, so we'll have a variety of our own programming that will initiate and then also, you know, we'll have people rent space to have their own programming <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=728.207">but</a>  our focus on our own programming will be to keep things no cost or low cost as much as possible to make things as accessible as possible to everybody in the community.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=738.33">And</a>  it's, I think we, you and I talked a little bit offline about this, but the it sounds like it's part of it, like a part of the agreement with having the dispensary in this city is that they sort of donate that space.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=750.593">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=751.153">So,</a>  you know, part of the, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=754.787">negotiation</a>  of these host agreements is how they're providing a public benefit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=759.151">So</a>  this was a very concrete way that theory could provide a public benefit to the community by donating the space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=765.797">And</a>  they're not only donating the space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=767.358">I</a>  mean, they're committing the funds to the build out of the space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=771.141">It</a>  needs to be significantly upgraded to suit our needs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=778.687">And</a>  they're committing the funds for that.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=780.815">Okay,</a>  so once the host agreement is signed, then they'll start kind of working on making the space usable for the Arts Center.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=786.556">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=787.037">So</a>  there'll be significant renovations to the entire building. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=790.137">And</a>  also, we do want to just clarify for everybody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=793.018">So</a>  Theory is going to be at the rear of the building, we will be at the front of the building, and there's actually a space in between. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=800.26">So</a>  there will be no physical connection, just so you know, where you mentioned, you know, children being on the premises, there's no physical connection between this dispensary and the Arts Center space, we are wholly separate.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=810.783">helpful</a>  to know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=811.724">And</a>  that that area is on a bus line as well, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=814.666">Is</a>  it?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=815.327">It</a>  is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=815.667">So</a>  it'll be a very accessible space where it was a dealership. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=818.63">There's</a>  plenty of parking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=820.231">It's</a>  on a major road. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=821.792">So</a>  you know, very easy for people to get to.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=825.115">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=825.956">And</a>  not too far from you know, where the Green Line hopefully will be opening up soon.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=830.7">Yeah,</a>  awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=832.361">What</a>  are you most excited about for this Arts Center?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=837.077">It's</a>  hard to say because I've been working on this for so long. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=839.578">I</a>  just want to see it come to be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=842.859">Just</a>  the idea of it actually coming to fruition after, you know, thinking about this for so long. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=850.061">But</a>  I just can't wait for that day when we open the doors and we see the public there and people enjoying the space and having the opportunity to really engage with the arts in a way that they're not able to because we don't have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=863.065">a</a>  physical space for the arts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=864.526">All</a>  these amazing organizations, we operate out of people's homes and basements and, you know, community spaces and we don't really have a place for us to come together for the arts.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=877.494">Yeah,</a>  that sounds really exciting to have that space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=881.816">Was</a>  there anything else that you want to make sure to mention today?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=886.315">I</a>  think that mostly covers it, but certainly we have our Facebook and Twitter page for the Arts Center. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=894.803">As</a>  soon as we know that this is moving ahead, we will be announcing it publicly, and we'll be keeping everybody up to date. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=903.831">We've</a>  done a couple of surveys of the community, both lay community people and artists, to really get an understanding. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=911.098">of</a>  what they want to see in our art center. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=913.079">And</a>  that's important to us because we don't want to just do what we think people want. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=917.24">Again,</a>  we want to know what people want from us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=919.68">But</a>  I'm sure we'll be doing more with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=922.061">So</a>  keep your eyes open for it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=924.421">And</a>  please engage with us and let us know what you want to see.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=927.822">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=928.342">And</a>  you shared some really helpful links about everything that we've talked about today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=931.723">And</a>  I'll put those in the show notes for people to be able to stay updated about what's happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=938.525">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=939.165">Well,</a>  thank you so much, Laurel.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=940.984">Thank</a>  you for having me and letting me talk about all of these great projects.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=944.852">It's</a>  always exciting to hear about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=954.481">Thank</a>  you so much to Laurel Siegel. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=956.502">Shortly</a>  after recording this interview, Laurel updated me that the mayor has signed the host agreement with Thierry Wellness, the cannabis dispensary, allowing plans for the Arts Centre to continue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=966.924">You</a>  can find lots of information in today's show notes to follow some of the organizations Laurel mentioned today, as well as to follow the progress of Arts Collaborative Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=976.367">And</a>  now, let's hear from our kid correspondents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=986.687">Hi</a>  guys, thank you so much for meeting with me today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=989.408">If</a>  we could start by you just introducing yourself, so saying your name, pronouns, how old you are, and what school you go to.</p>

    <p>[-Ad9b17iUII_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=998.633">My</a>  name is Joe, my pronouns are he or him, and I go to fifth grade at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1008.288">My</a>  name is Conrad Hogan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1010.55">My</a>  pronouns are he or him and I go to third grade at Oralberts Elementary School. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1016.894">I</a>  am nine years old.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1019.571">Thanks,</a>  guys. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1020.772">So</a>  last time we met in the fall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1022.193">So</a>  we were kind of thinking about the year to come. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1024.715">And</a>  I asked you the question about favorite food. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1027.396">You</a>  said that hasn't changed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1028.437">So</a>  Colleen's, some ice cream and donuts with a difference. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1031.959">Solid</a>  choices, I think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1034.381">So</a>  we had talked before we started recording just about a couple of different things that you guys might want to chat about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1040.305">But</a>  yeah, I'm wondering what the highlights have been of your year since the last time we spoke.</p>

    <p>[-Ad9b17iUII_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1047.037">Me,</a>  definitely one of the big highlights was the new library opening on January 3rd. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1055.723">We</a>  went the day after for a first time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1058.625">It</a>  is definitely much better than the old one.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1064.71">Yeah,</a>  what do you like about it?</p>

    <p>[-Ad9b17iUII_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1067.552">So</a>  already I like the maker space, even though I haven't been in it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1073.249">I'm</a>  a future engineer, so I'm going to be probably spending some time in there once it opens, testing out prototypes, building prototypes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1087.88">I</a>  think the video game section, there's a teen room and you can rent out video games or play video games. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1095.945">But</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gaw8wtr2oeVRwKWpBRa9U?t=1097.727">You</a>  have to be how old?</p>
