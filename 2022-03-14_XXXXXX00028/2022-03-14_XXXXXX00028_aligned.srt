00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:07,602
Hey Medford Bites listeners, today we have two great interviews.

2
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:13,543
One all about the arts in Medford, and the other is an update from some young guests from earlier in this season.

3
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:14,583
Hope you enjoy.

4
00:00:14,603 --> 00:00:24,566
Alright, hi, thank you so much for joining me today.

5
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:28,947
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about yourself.

6
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,592
Thanks for inviting me.

7
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:33,212
My name is Laurel Siegel.

8
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:41,316
My pronouns are she, her, and I am involved in a number of different arts organizations and initiatives around Medford.

9
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:42,457
Awesome.

10
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:43,057
Thank you.

11
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:49,200
So then the first question for all my guests is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,641
And what do you like to eat there?

13
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,282
Well, it's it's

14
00:00:54,628 --> 00:01:10,908
been used many times already on your podcast, but I have to say Goldilocks they're right up the street from me and they're just right breakfast sandwich is pretty wonderful and also their owners Lindsay and Ed are just such great people and great contributors to our community.

15
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:12,650
So do you have a favorite bagel?

16
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:15,045
everything bagel.

17
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:17,847
Yeah, that's a solid choice.

18
00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:19,548
Awesome.

19
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:24,651
Okay, so I know we have a lot of you're involved in a couple different art groups throughout Medford.

20
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:32,637
And it sounds and we talked about sort of a list of those and maybe we could start with talking about the ArtsLive Medford Foundation.

21
00:01:33,757 --> 00:01:34,238
Absolutely.

22
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:40,822
So ArtsLive Medford Foundation is a private foundation started by May Mark Brecht

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,882
who has been involved in numerous arts organizations over the years.

24
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:53,306
And really what she saw was a need for some additional funding for our programs here in Medford.

25
00:01:53,626 --> 00:02:01,290
We have our wonderful Medford Arts Council and some other resources, but we also knew that they weren't able to fully fund all of the programs.

26
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,033
And also because they're part of the state's Mass Cultural Council program, they have some limitations on what they can fund.

27
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:13,638
And so she decided to create this foundation to enable us to fund some of these additional programs.

28
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:15,558
Awesome.

29
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:17,959
Can you give some examples of what they've funded?

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,860
Absolutely.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,782
So we have been in existence for six years now.

32
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:31,005
And over that time, we have funded programs including MARV, the Medford Art Bus through Arts Medford.

33
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:35,267
We funded some programs for the Lakota Youth Stay Program.

34
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:49,966
And also there is the third grade songwriting project in some of our public schools and various musical and theatrical performances, including the Medford Jazz Festival programs.

35
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,690
So a real variety of programs around the city.

36
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:53,545
Awesome.

37
00:02:53,865 --> 00:03:00,808
And so the idea is like, if you have an art related project that you need help funding, you can apply to Arts Alive.

38
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:02,068
Absolutely.

39
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:07,590
And it's a pretty simple application and we fund grants anywhere from $100 to $2,000.

40
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:13,413
Arts Alive has also helped out this podcast.

41
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:13,893
Absolutely.

42
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:14,993
And we were happy to do that.

43
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:16,194
Awesome.

44
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:17,054
Awesome.

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:18,820
Great.

46
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,284
And we're going to have some links in the show notes about sort of how people can connect to Arts Alive or find out some more information as well.

47
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:30,327
But do you have any recommendations about like best ways for folks to learn more about Arts Alive?

48
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:38,952
If you're interested in finding out more about us, you can just send us an email at artsalivemedford, that's all one word, at gmail.com.

49
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:39,973
Awesome.

50
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:40,613
Great.

51
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,183
And you also are involved with CACHE.

52
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,886
Do you want to talk a little bit about that?

53
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:49,989
So yes, I'm the president of CACHE.

54
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:54,033
CACHE stands for the Coalition of Arts, Culture and a Healthy Economy.

55
00:03:54,694 --> 00:04:01,861
And what we are is a coalition of 24 arts, culture, history and educational organizations in the city of Medford.

56
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:03,863
And our role is really to

57
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:10,719
promote and amplify the visibility of the arts and our amazing cultural resources that we have in the city.

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,540
There's also that healthy economy element.

59
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:26,025
Not only are the arts an economic engine, but also we work on the relationship between the business and the arts community because there's a lot that we can do to help each other and work collaboratively together.

60
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:32,007
Yeah, what's an example of that, like a relationship between arts and business?

61
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:41,999
Well, one of the great examples is our circle the square program which we are so excited, we're bringing back live this summer on Saturday, June 18.

62
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,841
After not having it for a couple of years.

63
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:57,592
So that was really born out of, you know, a couple of people looking around Medford square and saying, we need to do something to bring people into the square get them excited about coming down to Medford square.

64
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:12,663
And so while we program arts and culture activities all the way from City Hall down to Colleen's, we also engage all of the businesses or as many as many of the businesses as we can in the square and also outside the square come and have tables at the event.

65
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:17,947
So getting people to walk into a storefront and find out more about these businesses.

66
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:18,367
Yeah.

67
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:20,028
So great.

68
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,170
And how did you how did you become involved?

69
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,612
Like what's where does your sort of passion for art come from?

70
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,512
Quite honestly, I don't have a background in the arts.

71
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:33,035
I was on the board of Medford Farmers Market.

72
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:37,859
And my friend Susan Fairchild was on the board with me.

73
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,882
She was involved with Caché and said, come get involved.

74
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:46,006
And she was actually the spark behind the initial idea for Circle Square.

75
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:48,989
And so she brought me into Caché.

76
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,971
And then over the years, my role developed with the organization.

77
00:05:53,535 --> 00:06:10,788
Yeah, I think we've been hearing like a little bit too about the connection of art in Medford and like some another sort of theme on the podcast is like inclusivity and sort of thinking about equity and I've heard about some different art popping up around the city that is sort of related to those themes.

78
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:12,650
Is that something that Cachet is involved in?

79
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:21,585
Not those specific projects that you may be referring to, but certainly we've made specific efforts towards inclusivity.

80
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:35,617
We certainly always try to ensure that our programming and our performers represent a variety of styles and different groups of people in our community.

81
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:52,329
And also, we did have an initiative a few years ago where we went out to different segments of the population to try to engage with them because we realized, you know, this expectation of you're going to come to us and engage with the way we want to engage.

82
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,390
And we went to them saying, what do you want?

83
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:59,793
And how can we be a part of your community as opposed to just inviting you to be part of ours?

84
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:12,274
Yeah, that's like I think a theme that I've been hearing from folks in that in these like attempts to sort of be more representative of the of the people in the city or being able to like hear what folks are wanting.

85
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:12,954
Sounds great.

86
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:14,535
Awesome.

87
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:18,417
Is there anything else about cashier that you think it's important for folks to know about?

88
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:19,777
Absolutely.

89
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:27,719
So, first of all, in addition to Circle the Square, we have our Mystic River Celebration, which is actually our original festival.

90
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,140
It's at the Condon Shell every fall.

91
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,061
We were able to bring that back last September, and it was such a wonderful event.

92
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:40,362
It turned out to be a perfect, beautiful day, and I think people were really eager for an opportunity to come out and be part of the community.

93
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:45,924
The other thing that we do have, we have our Arts Across Medford online calendar

94
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:49,586
which features events just within Medford.

95
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:52,687
And last year we had over 1,200 events.

96
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:58,931
It includes online events as well as now increasingly going back to in-person events all around the city.

97
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:02,112
So I really encourage anybody to go check that out on our website.

98
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,953
It's just cacheandmedford.org.

99
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:12,858
Or also if anybody wants to, they can go to a link on the website and sign up and get weekly email updates about all of the events coming up.

100
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:14,780
Awesome.

101
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,642
Is Cache involved in like the Makerspace at all in the library?

102
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:20,064
We are not involved in the Makerspace.

103
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:29,551
Makerspace is part of Arts Medford, a different arts organization in the city, although we certainly have involvement together and the Makerspace has been a member of Cache.

104
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:30,232
Oh, cool.

105
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:32,554
Great.

106
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:40,680
Okay, so I think our final thing that we were wanting to talk about is the the Arts Collaborative and the Medford, yeah.

107
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:45,971
Yes, Arts Collaborative Medford is very exciting.

108
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:50,897
We are working on the creation of a community arts center in Medford.

109
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:56,303
There have been a number of attempts over many years to create an arts center.

110
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:59,453
and our particular group has been active since 2017.

111
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:11,062
We have representatives of CACHE, the Medford Arts Council, Arts Medford, city personnel and officials that have been working on this.

112
00:09:11,122 --> 00:09:18,828
And originally we were looking at a city-owned property over off of Fulton Street that has been vacant for a few years.

113
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:23,449
But then a year ago, we were approached with an amazing opportunity.

114
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:30,157
One of the applicants for a cannabis dispensary offered us a space.

115
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:34,362
So we are partnering with Theory Wellness, which is

116
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:41,127
looking to open a dispensary at what was the VW dealership on Mystic Ave, right next to Atlas Liquors.

117
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:46,570
They have offered us 10,000 square feet at the front of the building, what was the showroom.

118
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:53,194
So it would be front and center, very visible to the public, that would be our community arts center.

119
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:54,175
Awesome.

120
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:58,117
And what's your vision for the arts center?

121
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:02,475
It's going to be a very multi-use space.

122
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:10,077
It actually has a beautiful layout already of large and small and medium-sized spaces.

123
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:14,918
So it's going to be a mix of studios for individual artists.

124
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:20,320
We'll have classrooms to have classes and workshops and various presentations.

125
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,241
And then there is a large space that could serve for a variety of performances and events.

126
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:28,542
It will also be a gallery space.

127
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,375
could be a meeting space for community events.

128
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:35,106
So it's gonna have a lot of opportunity for a variety of uses.

129
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:41,281
And it sounds like this is a plan that's like in the sort of like approval process.

130
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:46,024
Is there anything that is important for the community to know about that or how to be involved?

131
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:49,807
We are still waiting for the final approval.

132
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:55,932
Theory Wellness was a very strong candidate among the candidates for a dispensary license.

133
00:10:55,992 --> 00:11:00,336
And they're in the process of, we believe, finalizing their host agreement with the city.

134
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:03,898
So we're just waiting for that host agreement to be signed.

135
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:04,459
And then it's

136
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:11,421
just steaming ahead, you know, the hope is that we can open this art center by the end of this calendar year.

137
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:12,601
Wow.

138
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:19,303
Is it something that like public support could help you move along or is it just sort of a like process?

139
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:26,465
You know, it never hurts, but I think, you know, certainly we've had discussions directly with the mayor and other city officials.

140
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:27,005
They know how

141
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:30,586
badly we want this project to move ahead.

142
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:35,207
So they're certainly familiar with our intentions here.

143
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:43,610
It never hurts to remind people, you know, particularly if people are enthusiastic about this project to hear that, you know, we'd love to see this happen in our city.

144
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:58,216
Yeah, is it so is it open to like kids and adults like all ages or what's the sort of exactly, you know, we're still working out the details on, you know, any specific program, but certainly it will be accessible to everybody in the community.

145
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:07,820
And we in particular, so we'll have a variety of our own programming that will initiate and then also, you know, we'll have people rent space to have their own programming

146
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:17,449
but our focus on our own programming will be to keep things no cost or low cost as much as possible to make things as accessible as possible to everybody in the community.

147
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:29,493
And it's, I think we, you and I talked a little bit offline about this, but the it sounds like it's part of it, like a part of the agreement with having the dispensary in this city is that they sort of donate that space.

148
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:31,133
Exactly.

149
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:32,894
So, you know, part of the,

150
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:39,091
negotiation of these host agreements is how they're providing a public benefit.

151
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:45,756
So this was a very concrete way that theory could provide a public benefit to the community by donating the space.

152
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,218
And they're not only donating the space.

153
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:50,961
I mean, they're committing the funds to the build out of the space.

154
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:58,587
It needs to be significantly upgraded to suit our needs.

155
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:00,189
And they're committing the funds for that.

156
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:06,196
Okay, so once the host agreement is signed, then they'll start kind of working on making the space usable for the Arts Center.

157
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:06,996
Exactly.

158
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,817
So there'll be significant renovations to the entire building.

159
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,338
And also, we do want to just clarify for everybody.

160
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:19,960
So Theory is going to be at the rear of the building, we will be at the front of the building, and there's actually a space in between.

161
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:30,302
So there will be no physical connection, just so you know, where you mentioned, you know, children being on the premises, there's no physical connection between this dispensary and the Arts Center space, we are wholly separate.

162
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:31,324
helpful to know.

163
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:34,446
And that that area is on a bus line as well, right?

164
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,107
Is it?

165
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:35,587
It is.

166
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:38,590
So it'll be a very accessible space where it was a dealership.

167
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,851
There's plenty of parking.

168
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:41,712
It's on a major road.

169
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,595
So you know, very easy for people to get to.

170
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:45,435
Great.

171
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:49,659
And not too far from you know, where the Green Line hopefully will be opening up soon.

172
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,341
Yeah, awesome.

173
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,423
What are you most excited about for this Arts Center?

174
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:59,558
It's hard to say because I've been working on this for so long.

175
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:01,959
I just want to see it come to be.

176
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:09,181
Just the idea of it actually coming to fruition after, you know, thinking about this for so long.

177
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:22,485
But I just can't wait for that day when we open the doors and we see the public there and people enjoying the space and having the opportunity to really engage with the arts in a way that they're not able to because we don't have

178
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:24,266
a physical space for the arts.

179
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:36,753
All these amazing organizations, we operate out of people's homes and basements and, you know, community spaces and we don't really have a place for us to come together for the arts.

180
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:39,815
Yeah, that sounds really exciting to have that space.

181
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:44,378
Was there anything else that you want to make sure to mention today?

182
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:54,563
I think that mostly covers it, but certainly we have our Facebook and Twitter page for the Arts Center.

183
00:14:54,803 --> 00:15:03,551
As soon as we know that this is moving ahead, we will be announcing it publicly, and we'll be keeping everybody up to date.

184
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:10,418
We've done a couple of surveys of the community, both lay community people and artists, to really get an understanding.

185
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:13,019
of what they want to see in our art center.

186
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,220
And that's important to us because we don't want to just do what we think people want.

187
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,100
Again, we want to know what people want from us.

188
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,961
But I'm sure we'll be doing more with that.

189
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:23,821
So keep your eyes open for it.

190
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:27,262
And please engage with us and let us know what you want to see.

191
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:28,262
Awesome.

192
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:31,703
And you shared some really helpful links about everything that we've talked about today.

193
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:36,884
And I'll put those in the show notes for people to be able to stay updated about what's happening.

194
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:38,885
Thank you.

195
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:40,145
Well, thank you so much, Laurel.

196
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:44,331
Thank you for having me and letting me talk about all of these great projects.

197
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:46,596
It's always exciting to hear about.

198
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:56,181
Thank you so much to Laurel Siegel.

199
00:15:56,502 --> 00:16:06,284
Shortly after recording this interview, Laurel updated me that the mayor has signed the host agreement with Thierry Wellness, the cannabis dispensary, allowing plans for the Arts Centre to continue.

200
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:15,526
You can find lots of information in today's show notes to follow some of the organizations Laurel mentioned today, as well as to follow the progress of Arts Collaborative Medford.

201
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,947
And now, let's hear from our kid correspondents.

202
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,848
Hi guys, thank you so much for meeting with me today.

203
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:36,212
If we could start by you just introducing yourself, so saying your name, pronouns, how old you are, and what school you go to.

204
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:47,458
My name is Joe, my pronouns are he or him, and I go to fifth grade at the Roberts Elementary School.

205
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:50,129
My name is Conrad Hogan.

206
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,694
My pronouns are he or him and I go to third grade at Oralberts Elementary School.

207
00:16:56,894 --> 00:16:57,895
I am nine years old.

208
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:00,752
Thanks, guys.

209
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:02,173
So last time we met in the fall.

210
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:04,615
So we were kind of thinking about the year to come.

211
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:07,376
And I asked you the question about favorite food.

212
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:08,397
You said that hasn't changed.

213
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:11,739
So Colleen's, some ice cream and donuts with a difference.

214
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:12,980
Solid choices, I think.

215
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:19,564
So we had talked before we started recording just about a couple of different things that you guys might want to chat about.

216
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:24,608
But yeah, I'm wondering what the highlights have been of your year since the last time we spoke.

217
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:34,703
Me, definitely one of the big highlights was the new library opening on January 3rd.

218
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:38,605
We went the day after for a first time.

219
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:44,069
It is definitely much better than the old one.

220
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,890
Yeah, what do you like about it?

221
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:52,055
So already I like the maker space, even though I haven't been in it.

222
00:17:53,249 --> 00:18:06,679
I'm a future engineer, so I'm going to be probably spending some time in there once it opens, testing out prototypes, building prototypes.

223
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:15,885
I think the video game section, there's a teen room and you can rent out video games or play video games.

224
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:16,606
But yeah.

225
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,388
You have to be how old?

226
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,559
you need to graduate elementary school.

227
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,220
Yeah, anywhere from graduating elementary school to graduating high school.

228
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:30,441
Wow.

229
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,881
So something to look forward to for you next year.

230
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:33,801
Yep.

231
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:36,442
Awesome.

232
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:40,162
What are some of the things in the maker space that you're excited to use?

233
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:48,044
Well, I've heard there might be a 3D printer and maybe a laser.

234
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:50,207
Cool.

235
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:55,051
And that's basically all I'm really excited about.

236
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:56,011
Awesome.

237
00:18:56,712 --> 00:19:00,074
I've been really wanting to try 3D printing.

238
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:03,016
So I'm excited about that.

239
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,118
Yeah, that sounds really cool.

240
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,459
What about the books at the library?

241
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,721
Any book recommendations that you guys have?

242
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,204
I'm not really a big book guy.

243
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:17,786
I stick more to like sports.

244
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,362
Um, I would definitely recommend books by Stuart Gibbs.

245
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:29,364
He is my favorite author right now.

246
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:34,446
And he, he writes some really good like preteen books.

247
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:44,530
They've got books about spies, the moon, um, a zoo, some, some, uh,

248
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:48,677
some like night people and they're like mysteries.

249
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:48,977
Yeah.

250
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:50,818
And they're mysteries.

251
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:51,738
Cool.

252
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:52,799
That sounds awesome.

253
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:57,161
And I know that the space at the library, just the big kids room is like a lot different.

254
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:57,782
Have you guys checked?

255
00:19:57,802 --> 00:19:59,103
How much have you guys checked out?

256
00:19:59,163 --> 00:19:59,663
Yeah.

257
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:01,044
It's a lot of space.

258
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:02,745
Yeah.

259
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:03,085
Awesome.

260
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:04,285
Cool.

261
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:08,388
Um, what, so the new library is definitely a highlight of the year so far.

262
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,629
Uh, what else has been going on for you guys?

263
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:16,247
Um, what else is skiing?

264
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:17,087
Yes.

265
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:17,868
Yep.

266
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:18,929
That's a lot.

267
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:20,009
Yep.

268
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,992
I heard you guys do cross country skiing and downhill skiing.

269
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:23,792
Yeah.

270
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:25,754
And what are your favorite spots for that?

271
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:36,661
Um, so we cross country skate the Leo J. Martin golf course and ski track in West Massachusetts.

272
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,363
And we take classes there.

273
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:44,771
on Saturdays from about 8.30 to 10 a.m.

274
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:51,556
and on Wednesday nights from around 6.30 to 7.30.

275
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:58,320
And we have an epic pass for downhill.

276
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,562
We can go anywhere in the New England radius.

277
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:03,504
No, there are certain mountains.

278
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:06,966
Yeah, certain mountains that we don't need to pay for.

279
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:07,786
Wow.

280
00:21:09,162 --> 00:21:11,944
instead, but we've been going there a while.

281
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,326
What's your, what's your favorite place for downhill skiing?

282
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:18,427
Mount Snow.

283
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,028
That's in Vermont.

284
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,672
We've been to a lot of mountains, so I can't have a favorite.

285
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:28,833
They were all good.

286
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,493
Awesome.

287
00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:31,874
That's great.

288
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:33,935
And we did get some snow recently.

289
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:38,838
So what do you guys like to do around, around home, around Medford when it's, when you have a big snowstorm?

290
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:44,830
We usually play tackle football outside in our yard.

291
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,930
Wow.

292
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,111
If the snow's deep enough.

293
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:49,471
Yeah.

294
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:50,611
If the snow's deep enough.

295
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:54,252
Sounds kind of hard to run in deep snow and tackle each other.

296
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:55,793
We push it down with our feet.

297
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:57,273
Yeah, we push it down with our feet.

298
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:07,636
And we also like playing at like whatever weather with our neighbors, Cam and Brennan, like we mentioned last episode.

299
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:09,397
Shout out to them again.

300
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:12,519
Nice favorites of the neighborhood.

301
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:15,082
Yeah.

302
00:22:15,722 --> 00:22:15,943
Awesome.

303
00:22:15,963 --> 00:22:16,623
What about sledding?

304
00:22:16,643 --> 00:22:17,364
Do you guys do sledding?

305
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:19,626
Yeah, we did some of it.

306
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:23,651
Um, yeah, I went sledding at seven bumps.

307
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:27,114
By the Fellsmere Pond there.

308
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:28,275
Yeah.

309
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,677
I think that was Saturday I did it.

310
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,201
It was very icy and very fast.

311
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:39,946
Yeah, that place can be a little scarier.

312
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,748
It can be very scary.

313
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:45,752
Like you can feel like you're about to go into a pond.

314
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:46,472
Yeah.

315
00:22:47,153 --> 00:23:02,403
So um what I kind of don't like is the people don't listen to you if you're at the top of the hill yelling watch out but if you're if you're rumbling down the hill toward them yelling watch out then they actually listen to you.

316
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:11,228
Yeah yeah I think it's scary too because sometimes little kids will go on the other side and so there's like collisions and all yeah but it's fun too.

317
00:23:11,248 --> 00:23:12,249
Yeah yeah yeah.

318
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,290
Awesome.

319
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:15,331
What about school?

320
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:17,393
Any highlights of the school year so far?

321
00:23:18,194 --> 00:23:20,376
Today was our 100th day.

322
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:23,339
Yep, today was our 100th day of school.

323
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:24,080
Wow.

324
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,062
And what happens on the 100th day of school?

325
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:32,668
Usually we'll do like fun papers, still like math, but with a little 100th day theme.

326
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:33,048
Today

327
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:42,417
Our teacher did absolutely nothing and didn't even tell us.

328
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:50,802
And it wasn't until I got into the car after school that I found out that it happened to be the 100th day.

329
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:51,783
Oh, man.

330
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:54,865
So you didn't celebrate it at all in your class today?

331
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:56,666
We did a scavenger hunt.

332
00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:58,267
Yeah, we did a little scavenger hunt.

333
00:23:58,987 --> 00:23:59,668
Like the whole school?

334
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:03,443
Yeah, but that was for a different reason.

335
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:08,125
Our teacher had a baby in November.

336
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:08,185
Oh.

337
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:19,771
Ever since, but today was the subs last day with us because our teacher is going to come back on Monday.

338
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,972
Oh, wow.

339
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:22,672
Are you excited to see your teacher again?

340
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:24,493
Yes, definitely.

341
00:24:25,054 --> 00:24:25,474
That's hard.

342
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:27,315
That sounds like she left in the beginning of the year.

343
00:24:28,704 --> 00:24:30,726
Um, yeah, around November.

344
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:35,089
Cool.

345
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,390
I bet you'll get to hear lots of stories about her new baby.

346
00:24:38,371 --> 00:24:38,711
Yeah.

347
00:24:40,132 --> 00:24:40,432
Awesome.

348
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:46,917
And I know you guys, you mentioned last time, something that I had never heard of, which was the enrichment classes that they have at the Roberts.

349
00:24:46,957 --> 00:24:49,579
So those are happening now, right?

350
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:50,619
Yeah.

351
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:54,382
We are doing an acting, um,

352
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:59,007
and the play is next Thursday.

353
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:02,129
What's the play?

354
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:04,231
It takes place in a castle.

355
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:08,013
My mom is right around the corner and she hasn't seen it.

356
00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:10,055
Oh, it's a secret, okay.

357
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,236
We'll have to wait to hear about it.

358
00:25:12,717 --> 00:25:13,197
Yeah.

359
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:13,397
Awesome.

360
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:26,472
And I know, Conrad, you have a new talent since the last time we talked, too.

361
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:29,274
You picked up the guitar, right?

362
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:31,255
He's going to grab it.

363
00:25:33,076 --> 00:25:35,518
So I wanted to give you a chance to play something for us, if you'd like.

364
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:46,098
do do

365
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,495
Oh, awesome.

366
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:20,076
Are you taking lessons for the guitar?

367
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:21,837
Yeah, that's great.

368
00:26:22,877 --> 00:26:23,498
Wow.

369
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:24,598
And what's that song called?

370
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,380
That's right.

371
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,380
Awesome.

372
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:33,001
Great.

373
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:34,761
Well, is there anything else?

374
00:26:35,082 --> 00:26:38,623
I know we're talking about maybe thinking about the summer, what you guys are looking forward to.

375
00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:40,904
Anything else you want to mention?

376
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:43,805
So this,

377
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:48,795
This upcoming summer, I'm going into meal school.

378
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:53,239
So it's probably going to be a very big summer for me.

379
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:59,626
But that's basically all I really have to look forward to.

380
00:27:00,046 --> 00:27:01,247
Do you know if you've got anything?

381
00:27:01,648 --> 00:27:02,008
Oh.

382
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:02,789
And camps.

383
00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:04,891
Yeah, what kind of camps do you guys do?

384
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:07,914
I'm taking a piano camp.

385
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:15,403
It's like a week of school, except for pianists.

386
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:19,325
Mill School for pianists, it's one week.

387
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:24,949
It's like from nine to two every day.

388
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:25,049
I am

389
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:33,975
So we have a recital coming up on Saturday.

390
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:34,615
Tomorrow.

391
00:27:34,935 --> 00:27:35,456
Tomorrow.

392
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:43,040
And after that, I will be going to a baseball, to a baseball tryouts.

393
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,221
So a baseball league thing.

394
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:47,162
Yep.

395
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:48,242
Wow.

396
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:50,684
Do you guys do any other camps for the summer?

397
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:55,466
No, but we play flag football.

398
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:56,306
Yeah.

399
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:58,928
We're going to play flag football, soccer.

400
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:00,913
all different sports.

401
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:03,794
Awesome, that sounds really fun.

402
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:06,476
Do you have anything else you guys look forward to for the summer?

403
00:28:08,757 --> 00:28:18,182
Not really, but we were talking about before podcast, you were asking if we could talk a bit about our road trip last summer.

404
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,083
Yeah, that sounded really cool.

405
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:22,145
Do you want to say anything about it?

406
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:28,008
Yeah, so we rented an RV and we

407
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:38,696
started driving on July 17th, and we drove all the way from here to Yellowstone.

408
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:47,140
Yep, Yellowstone, Wyoming, in Wyoming, and back in the RV in three weeks, came back on August 5th.

409
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,322
Wow, and that was because there's something for fourth graders, isn't there some kind of thing with national parks?

410
00:28:52,902 --> 00:28:56,284
For fourth graders, well, if you're in fourth grade,

411
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,121
you get a free pass to any national park.

412
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:06,005
Fourth grade counts as anywhere in between when you start fourth grade and when you start fifth grade.

413
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:06,746
Oh, wow.

414
00:29:07,226 --> 00:29:09,507
You get a free pass to any national park.

415
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:11,088
Awesome.

416
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:13,009
What's that?

417
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,210
Sorry.

418
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,851
That's a lot.

419
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:16,712
Yeah.

420
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:22,555
From what I've heard, it was $30 a person to get into Yellowstone.

421
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,863
But because it was there, it didn't cost us anything.

422
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:31,425
And one additional point that we went into, Joe was sleeping.

423
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:35,607
And we need to tell the story that we had him sleeping.

424
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:51,819
So I was sleeping in the cabin above the driver's seat, and the RV pulls in and the person says, do you have a fourth grader in your vehicle?

425
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:55,380
And my dad says, yes, he's sleeping above us.

426
00:29:57,788 --> 00:30:02,511
Luckily, she took his word and let us in.

427
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:03,131
Okay.

428
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:06,112
So you went to what other parks did you go to besides Yellowstone?

429
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:14,057
Um, we went to look at your shirt.

430
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:19,699
Rocky Mountain National Park.

431
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,002
Grand Teton, Pictured Rocks,

432
00:30:25,243 --> 00:30:26,284
Niagara Falls.

433
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:27,924
Niagara Falls State Park.

434
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:34,668
Oh, and Lambeau Field National Park in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

435
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:36,569
Wow.

436
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:39,730
Is that where the Packers play?

437
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,091
Yes.

438
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:40,951
Okay, nice.

439
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:43,692
What was the best part of the trip?

440
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:45,893
We went to Mount Washua.

441
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:46,914
Oh, wow.

442
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:49,055
You guys saw a lot in three weeks.

443
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:50,956
Yeah.

444
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:52,677
What was the best part of the trip?

445
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:56,287
I have to say Green Bay.

446
00:30:57,048 --> 00:31:09,851
There was a KOA that we stayed out at and it had like a swimming pool and stuff that you can rent, like vehicles.

447
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:13,612
I think it had a mini golf course.

448
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:15,777
Yeah.

449
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:17,259
Let me make this short, man.

450
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:20,361
Everything you can possibly imagine.

451
00:31:20,662 --> 00:31:21,022
Wow.

452
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:21,723
Where was that?

453
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:23,504
A pancake house.

454
00:31:24,245 --> 00:31:27,167
Oh, you can eat pancakes.

455
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:27,968
Whoa.

456
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:31,992
In Palmer Gulch, South Dakota.

457
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:32,953
Wow.

458
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:34,214
That sounds awesome.

459
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:36,216
What was the weirdest thing about the trip?

460
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:37,457
What was the weirdest thing that happened?

461
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:39,038
Weirdest thing?

462
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:39,999
Hmm.

463
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:47,774
Oh yes, Mitchell, South Dakota, home of the world's only corn palace.

464
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:49,355
Corn palace?

465
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:50,495
Yes.

466
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:53,517
What is that?

467
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:55,858
It's exactly what it sounds like.

468
00:31:56,218 --> 00:32:02,021
This whole palace, it's not really made of corn, but it's like corn themed.

469
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:05,702
Oh wow.

470
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:08,924
Yeah, it's four stories tall.

471
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:10,825
And it says on the,

472
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,601
on the front, on the main entrance, the world's only corn palace.

473
00:32:16,362 --> 00:32:17,882
That's some kind of claim, I guess.

474
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:18,122
Yeah.

475
00:32:19,182 --> 00:32:19,423
Wow.

476
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:19,723
Yeah.

477
00:32:20,903 --> 00:32:28,605
Was there anything that surprised you or anything like you'd give advice to somebody else who was taking a cross country trip like this?

478
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:31,546
There's one thing I would suggest.

479
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:36,708
Number one, I can get very stinky inside of the RV.

480
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:39,649
And number two, if you go to Yellowstone,

481
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:51,232
Don't be surprised if you smell something horrible, because some of the geysers and hot springs smell putrid.

482
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:53,233
Horrible.

483
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:54,074
Yeah.

484
00:32:54,794 --> 00:32:58,337
And there's like this platform that you walk along, it smells

485
00:32:59,308 --> 00:32:59,788
Horrible.

486
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,551
Rotten eggs times 10.

487
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:04,591
Rotten eggs.

488
00:33:05,012 --> 00:33:05,432
Sulfur.

489
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:06,132
Sulfur.

490
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:06,733
Yeah.

491
00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:14,858
This, my wife is from this town in Oregon and they have like hot springs there and it comes out of this like, like a bubbler, like, like a water bubbler.

492
00:33:15,258 --> 00:33:18,140
And she tricked me and she said, this is the best thing you'll ever taste.

493
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,161
And she made me try it.

494
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:20,702
And it tastes like rotten eggs.

495
00:33:20,742 --> 00:33:21,502
It was disgusting.

496
00:33:21,962 --> 00:33:22,963
But she, she tricked me.

497
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:25,745
I imagine that's what you were smelling in Yellowstone.

498
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:26,942
Yeah.

499
00:33:27,683 --> 00:33:28,383
Except.

500
00:33:28,984 --> 00:33:30,425
Yeah.

501
00:33:31,186 --> 00:33:31,426
Wow.

502

Awesome.

506
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:39,852
Well, we covered a lot today.

507
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:43,275
Is there anything else that we missed or anything else you guys want to talk about?

508
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:45,036
No, not really.

509
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,978
And February break's coming up.

510
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:52,702
This episode will probably come out after February break, but you guys have any good plans for the break?

511
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:58,110
We're going to go skiing at Mount Snow for most, if not all, of the week.

512
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:00,332
Nice.

513
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:01,012
Awesome.

514
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:01,913
Your favorite mountain.

515
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:03,154
Yeah.

516
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:03,995
Good.

517
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:04,955
Awesome, guys.

518
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:07,117
Well, thank you so much for making the time for me.

519
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:08,498
