    <p>[m_f8x2fP_Xk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=29.319s">My</a>  name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=35.641s">Welcome</a>  to another live monthly presentation of First Friday's Words and Music, and getting us back into the groove for 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=45.823s">It's</a>  October, and that means that local elections are right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=51.705s">We've</a>  already seen forums, debates, and visits from across the political spectrum. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=58.316s">So</a>  we're going to take a slightly different tack on the season. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=63.883s">I</a>  should let you know that this program is supported in part by a grant from the Medford Arts Council, a local commission that is supported by the Massachusetts Cultural Council in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=76.666s">As</a>  always, we are serving and highlighting community once again here at 111 Arlington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=83.26s">We</a>  ask you to please be courteous to your neighbors as we move through the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=87.985s">Masking</a>  is not mandatory, but it is certainly welcomed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=91.828s">The</a>  coronavirus is still a very real thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=96.252s">So</a>  we appreciate the broadcast work being done by the folks at Medford Community Media, led by Kevin Harrington, who's back there, for guiding us as we... Yes, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=108.063s">As</a>  we broadcast to you via Medford Community Media, channel nine for Comcast and 47 for Verizon and the MCM YouTube feed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=119.688s">If</a>  you're out there watching on your electronic devices or your television, welcome to the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=126.291s">So</a>  it is indeed election season. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=130.572s">And</a>  two stalwarts of city hall are locked in a pitched battle for the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=136.855s">They</a>  appeared in a public debate the other day, and perhaps made you a bit wiser about their political platforms and aspirations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=145.739s">Tonight,</a>  however, we're going to look at things through a slightly different lens, as we have a sit-down conversation with one half of the equation in Medford's impending mayoral race. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=159.486s">Now</a>  in the run up to this evening's program, pointed political questions were advanced to me to ask our guest. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=167.785s">I</a>  won't be asking those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=170.787s">I</a>  am intentionally putting politics aside so that you can get a sense of the person beyond agendas, controversies, and conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=181.416s">That</a>  said, it is my distinct pleasure to welcome Medford City Councilor and mayoral candidate Rick Caraviello to the table of First Fridays at the WMCC. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=196.247s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=197.617s">Rick</a>  is a husband, a father, grandfather, business owner, and a 12-year member of the Medford City Council, including three terms as council president. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=208.747s">Rick</a>  brings a wealth of knowledge and dedication to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=212.85s">He</a>  is a lifelong resident of Medford, having raised his children in the community with his wife of 47 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=220.874s">Carol</a>  Caraviello is sitting here up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=224.055s">He</a>  has been an active member of the community, supporting organizations such as the Medford Kiwanis, the Medford Chamber of Commerce, and Medford Youth Hockey, WMCC, where he is no stranger. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=237.641s">He</a>  drops by pretty regularly, and he has demonstrated a sincere appreciation for this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=244.543s">Throughout</a>  his career, Caraviello has demonstrated a deep commitment to supporting working people and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=252.345s">Rick,</a>  welcome to West Medford Community Center, back, and to First Friday's Words of Music.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=257.706s">First</a>  of all, thank you, and it's my honor and privilege to be here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=261.487s">Excellent,</a>  excellent.</p>

    <p>[m_f8x2fP_Xk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=262.548s">So</a>  to begin your first Friday's visit to our neighborhood home, I want to get us in to a historical frame of mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=271.616s">I</a>  write a lot of poetry that speaks to the legacy, mission, and vision of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=279.844s">I</a>  want to share a piece of verse. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=282.406s">This</a>  is the one that has gotten me almost famous. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=287.757s">It's</a>  called Hired by the Mystic, and if you're ever on Mystic Ave, and you go by the Mystic mural, which is on the abutment wall across from the Somerville projects, <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=303.799s">25</a>  plus years in the making, two panels painted every year by a muralist by the name of David Fichter, and it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=311.55s">It's</a>  absolutely amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=313.072s">And</a>  the last two panels, which were painted last year and put in place this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=319.9s">I</a>  had the honor of being on one of the panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=323.101s">And</a>  then the other panel is a panel of children involved in environmental work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=328.864s">So</a>  if you ever have a chance to see it, you know, go check it out because I think it's an amazing, and not just because I'm on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=335.647s">But</a>  anyways, a piece of this poem is on that mural as well, and it's called Hired by the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=341.909s">They</a>  gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it, just a few streets hard by the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=348.516s">Banks</a>  turned a blind eye behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=353.04s">Class</a>  was an irresistible force, an immovable object. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=358.899s">It</a>  wasn't the written rule, but white folks knew the legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=362.022s">In</a>  our place, in this Mystic Valley space, where slaves and rum and ships had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=373.372s">So</a>  it was hard by the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=374.733s">We</a>  went muddy and a bit turned down, the only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=382.674s">But</a>  we named it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=384.195s">We</a>  claimed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=385.356s">We</a>  made it our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=387.658s">Even</a>  in the heat of summer, when the shores were parched and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=395.424s">We</a>  followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=399.067s">On</a>  our own Jordan shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=404.531s">We</a>  caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teeming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed hard by the mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=412.777s">We</a>  became community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=414.401s">We</a>  commanded unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=416.044s">We</a>  raised up our children in the way they should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=419.858s">As</a>  the river ebbs and flows, the tides will turn and our fortune grows. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=424.279s">A</a>  few more streets become our homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=426.62s">Houses</a>  on Sharon join Kin on Jerome. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=429.981s">From</a>  Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the white folk make more room for blacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=435.643s">The</a>  color line recedes a bit, church and school and the center sit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=440.344s">The</a>  ville becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shores. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=444.773s">Now</a>  the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=452.495s">That</a>  muddy mystic most days is clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=454.675s">The</a>  banks are freshly cut and green. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=457.096s">Faces</a>  once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=460.556s">These</a>  streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=467.478s">condominium</a>  culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, invest, and dispossess. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=476.343s">Now</a>  those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city and sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=485.879s">And</a>  yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins to where it ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=492.025s">The</a>  only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=506.579s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=507.519s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=508.331s">So</a>  that's a little reflection on how this neighborhood came to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=513.932s">Let's</a>  have a friendly chat with Rick Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=517.873s">So</a>  Rick, can we talk a bit about what you believe you know about this particular West Medford neighborhood?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=524.355s">Well,</a>  I live right down the street, as many of you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=528.036s">And</a>  I went to school with everybody in the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=537.205s">If</a>  you look on the wall here, you see many pictures of people who made the center what it is, and I remember many of them growing up, but there's one in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=547.49s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=549.111s">13</a>  years ago, when I decided to run for office, as you said, I had always been involved in the community, doing different things, but I was out campaigning, out walking the streets, and I came upon Wally Counts' house. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=563.719s">I</a>  didn't know that it was his house, <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=565.785s">I</a>  rang the bell, it was a hot summer night. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=567.767s">Oh</a>  Rick, how you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=569.948s">It's</a>  hot, come in and have some water. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=571.93s">So</a>  we sat down in his living room with his wife and we had a talk and he said, you know Rick, I've known you a long time, you've always done good for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=584.625s">And</a>  he says, I've supported a lot of candidates that I thought were going to be good candidates and do good for the community down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=595.289s">He</a>  says they didn't live up to their promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=600.923s">After</a>  an hour of talking and I made a commitment to him that I would always make sure that I'd be down here and take care of this community as long as I was able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=613.534s">And</a>  I hope Mr. Counts is proud of what he supported 13 years ago.</p>

    <p>[m_f8x2fP_Xk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=620.52s">13</a>  years ago, okay, very good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=626.107s">Family,</a>  I know, you know, because you and I, we talk a lot, is a very important element of your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=633.349s">How</a>  do you feel that family life has shaped the person that you are today?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=638.451s">Well,</a>  you have my wife there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=640.972s">We've</a>  been married 47 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=643.073s">And</a>  we were both, we got married young. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=647.754s">And</a>  I was, you know, young, and my wife, <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=654.488s">kind</a>  of brought me up, and so I hope that she's proud of the prison that she's developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=662.133s">My</a>  parents gave her a 22 when she was a little boy, and this is what I've grown up to be, and I owe it all to her.</p>

    <p>[m_f8x2fP_Xk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=668.698s">Oh</a>  my gosh, fantastic, fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=671.239s">Well,</a>  you know, you kind of are answering one of the questions that I want to ask you, and maybe you've already answered it in a certain way, but can you talk about who your early role models and heroes were?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=686.831s">I</a>  didn't really have any early role models or heroes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=690.837s">I'm</a>  an only child. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=693.962s">My</a>  mother passed away a few weeks after I was born. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=700.133s">I</a>  don't have like brothers or sisters like other people did. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=703.115s">So</a>  being in the NHL is a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=705.156s">So</a>  I didn't really have anyone to look up to. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=708.838s">Just</a>  my parents, and that was about it.</p>

    <p>[m_f8x2fP_Xk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=711.7s">OK,</a>  so we always ask this question when we're with our friends from different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=718.563s">Who</a>  did you run with? <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=719.524s">Who</a>  were your pals? <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=721.665s">Who</a>  were your partners?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=724.066s">Believe</a>  it or not, we still hang with our core group of junior high school friends that moved on to high school, and we go out probably every couple of weeks with our core 10 or 12 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=737.89s">And</a>  Peter Petrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=742.111s">I</a>  know Petrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=742.871s">Peter</a>  Petrella.</p>

    <p>[m_f8x2fP_Xk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=744.772s">Pete</a>  was in my class, class of 75.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=747.052s">That</a>  was the other Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=748.553s">There</a>  was two Peters. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=749.873s">It</a>  was two Peters, that's Peter the Accountant. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=752.015s">This</a>  is his cousin. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=753.596s">Tony</a>  Daddario, George Garofalo, Jack Santoro. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=760.001s">We</a>  started out the Lincoln Junior High and we remained friends forever.</p>

    <p>[m_f8x2fP_Xk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=763.824s">All</a>  right, all right, cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=766.506s">That</a>  sounds like it would sound if it was coming from me.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=768.487s">And</a>  then over the years we took in some of the West Bedford kids, The Clocks, Kenny Mayarco.</p>

    <p>[m_f8x2fP_Xk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=775.172s">Okay,</a>  okay, I knew Kenny Mayarco.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=779.815s">And</a>  I say, and to this day, we're friends.</p>

    <p>[m_f8x2fP_Xk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=783.616s">And</a>  close friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=786.657s">So</a>  you've been doing the work that you've been doing at City Hall for close to a decade and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=794.519s">What</a>  has it taught you about yourself?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=799.509s">I</a>  can tell you now, I'm certainly not the same person I was 12 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=804.517s">I've</a>  grown, I've learned, and I've changed my attitude on a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=811.926s">It's</a>  helped me to grow and grow into a different person. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=815.848s">Though</a>  I always had a value system, the value system has changed over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=819.849s">And</a>  again, I always managed to stay involved in the community as I am now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=826.512s">I</a>  still belong to the Kiwanis. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=827.772s">I</a>  still work at the food bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=829.693s">I</a>  do work at the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=830.813s">So</a>  as you know, I've been dedicated to this community my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=834.415s">And</a>  I don't come from, my parents never did this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=840.757s">Where</a>  it came from is when I was like about 45, and I met a friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=846.683s">He</a>  says, why don't you join a meeting at the corners for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=850.908s">I</a>  gave his number. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=852.43s">And</a>  it was kind of them who shaped me, because we met every week, and it was a bunch of community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=859.517s">And</a>  I would listen to them, and they would tell the stories of the good things they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=862.98s">There</a>  was a few political people in there, but they were the ones that actually taught me community service. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=868.824s">And</a>  I kind of commend them for doing it.</p>

    <p>[m_f8x2fP_Xk_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=872.727s">Yeah,</a>  so when we talk about role models and heroes, perhaps some of your role models and heroes came out of that group.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=879.072s">Back</a>  then, there was a lot of political people, and there were business and community leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=885.877s">I</a>  learned from them, and I aspired to be them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=890.342s">I</a>  was the young kid back then, and they were all older. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=893.405s">But</a>  you listen to the stories they would tell, even the politician stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=899.791s">They</a>  talked about the good things they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=902.813s">As</a>  I tell even my new Councilors, there isn't a better feeling than doing something good for somebody who really needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=910.378s">And</a>  I'm not talking about, you know, like Joe Jones calling, hey, can you fix the pothole? <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=913.82s">But</a>  somebody who really needs help that doesn't relate to your job as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iwHfXwWQ0nY&t=919.664s">And</a>  it's a real good feeling when you do something good for somebody.</p>
