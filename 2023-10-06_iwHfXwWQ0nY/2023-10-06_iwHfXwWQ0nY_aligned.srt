1
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:10,630
do

2
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:34,940
My name is Terry E. Cotter, and I direct elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

3
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:44,783
Welcome to another live monthly presentation of First Friday's Words and Music, and getting us back into the groove for 2023.

4
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:50,725
It's October, and that means that local elections are right around the corner.

5
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:57,534
We've already seen forums, debates, and visits from across the political spectrum.

6
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:02,722
So we're going to take a slightly different tack on the season.

7
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:16,046
I should let you know that this program is supported in part by a grant from the Medford Arts Council, a local commission that is supported by the Massachusetts Cultural Council in the city of Medford.

8
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:22,528
As always, we are serving and highlighting community once again here at 111 Arlington Street.

9
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,524
We ask you to please be courteous to your neighbors as we move through the evening.

10
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:31,248
Masking is not mandatory, but it is certainly welcomed.

11
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:34,831
The coronavirus is still a very real thing.

12
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:46,802
So we appreciate the broadcast work being done by the folks at Medford Community Media, led by Kevin Harrington, who's back there, for guiding us as we... Yes, absolutely.

13
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:59,328
As we broadcast to you via Medford Community Media, channel nine for Comcast and 47 for Verizon and the MCM YouTube feed.

14
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:05,170
If you're out there watching on your electronic devices or your television, welcome to the show.

15
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,532
So it is indeed election season.

16
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:15,955
And two stalwarts of city hall are locked in a pitched battle for the mayor's office.

17
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:25,059
They appeared in a public debate the other day, and perhaps made you a bit wiser about their political platforms and aspirations.

18
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:38,326
Tonight, however, we're going to look at things through a slightly different lens, as we have a sit-down conversation with one half of the equation in Medford's impending mayoral race.

19
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:46,674
Now in the run up to this evening's program, pointed political questions were advanced to me to ask our guest.

20
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:49,627
I won't be asking those questions.

21
00:02:50,787 --> 00:03:00,695
I am intentionally putting politics aside so that you can get a sense of the person beyond agendas, controversies, and conflict.

22
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:12,685
That said, it is my distinct pleasure to welcome Medford City Councilor and mayoral candidate Rick Caraviello to the table of First Fridays at the WMCC.

23
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:16,728
Absolutely.

24
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:28,206
Rick is a husband, a father, grandfather, business owner, and a 12-year member of the Medford City Council, including three terms as council president.

25
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:32,330
Rick brings a wealth of knowledge and dedication to the community.

26
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:39,733
He is a lifelong resident of Medford, having raised his children in the community with his wife of 47 years?

27
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:43,135
Carol Caraviello is sitting here up front.

28
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:56,941
He has been an active member of the community, supporting organizations such as the Medford Kiwanis, the Medford Chamber of Commerce, and Medford Youth Hockey, WMCC, where he is no stranger.

29
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:04,023
He drops by pretty regularly, and he has demonstrated a sincere appreciation for this neighborhood.

30
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:11,825
Throughout his career, Caraviello has demonstrated a deep commitment to supporting working people and their families.

31
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:17,606
Rick, welcome to West Memphis Community Center, back, and to First Friday's Words of Music.

32
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:20,367
First of all, thank you, and it's my honor and privilege to be here this evening.

33
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:22,488
Excellent, excellent.

34
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:30,976
So to begin your first Friday's visit to our neighborhood home, I want to get us in to a historical frame of mind.

35
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:38,843
I write a lot of poetry that speaks to the legacy, mission, and vision of this community.

36
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:41,485
I want to share a piece of verse.

37
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:46,269
This is the one that has gotten me almost famous.

38
00:04:47,757 --> 00:05:01,536
It's called Hired by the Mystic, and if you're ever on Mystic Ave, and you go by the Mystic mural, which is on the abutment wall across from the Somerville projects,

39
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:11,349
25 plus years in the making, two panels painted every year by a muralist by the name of David Fichter, and it's amazing.

40
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,711
It's absolutely amazing.

41
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:17,758
And the last two panels, which were painted last year and put in place this year,

42
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,501
I had the honor of being on one of the panels.

43
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:28,283
And then the other panel is a panel of children involved in environmental work.

44
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:35,167
So if you ever have a chance to see it, you know, go check it out because I think it's an amazing, and not just because I'm on it.

45
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:40,469
But anyways, a piece of this poem is on that mural as well, and it's called Hired by the Mystic.

46
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:47,735
They gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it, just a few streets hard by the river.

47
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:52,179
Banks turned a blind eye behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money.

48
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,605
Class was an irresistible force, an immovable object.

49
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,181
It wasn't the written rule, but white folks knew the legal.

50
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:12,531
In our place, in this Mystic Valley space, where slaves and rum and ships had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.

51
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,673
So it was hard by the Mystic.

52
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:21,799
We went muddy and a bit turned down, the only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town.

53
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,595
But we named it.

54
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:24,956
We claimed it.

55
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:26,697
We made it our own.

56
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:34,903
Even in the heat of summer, when the shores were parched and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river.

57
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:38,306
We followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront.

58
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:44,171
On our own Jordan shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ.

59
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:52,137
We caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teeming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed hard by the mystic.

60
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:53,920
We became community.

61
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:55,703
We commanded unity.

62
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:58,609
We raised up our children in the way they should go.

63
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:03,799
As the river ebbs and flows, the tides will turn and our fortune grows.

64
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,200
A few more streets become our homes.

65
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,281
Houses on Sharon join Kin on Jerome.

66
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:15,322
From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the white folk make more room for blacks.

67
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,644
The color line recedes a bit, church and school and the center sit.

68
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:23,805
The ville becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shores.

69
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:31,715
Now the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same.

70
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,655
That muddy mystic most days is clean.

71
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:36,636
The banks are freshly cut and green.

72
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:40,496
Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town.

73
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:46,858
These streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines.

74
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:55,302
condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, invest, and dispossess.

75
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:04,748
Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city and sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan friends.

76
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,364
And yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins to where it ends.

77
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:22,635
The only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own.

78
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:26,999
Thank you.

79
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:27,860
Thank you.

80
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:33,332
So that's a little reflection on how this neighborhood came to be.

81
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:36,133
Let's have a friendly chat with Rick Caraviello.

82
00:08:37,873 --> 00:08:43,214
So Rick, can we talk a bit about what you believe you know about this particular West Memphis neighborhood?

83
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:47,415
Well, I live right down the street, as many of you know.

84
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:53,137
And I went to school with everybody in the whole city.

85
00:08:57,205 --> 00:09:06,330
If you look on the wall here, you see many pictures of people who made the center what it is, and I remember many of them growing up, but there's one in particular.

86
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,091
Okay.

87
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:23,479
13 years ago, when I decided to run for office, as you said, I had always been involved in the community, doing different things, but I was out campaigning, out walking the streets, and I came upon Wally Counts' house.

88
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:24,740
I didn't know that it was his house,

89
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:27,506
I rang the bell, it was a hot summer night.

90
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,868
Oh Rick, how you doing?

91
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:31,369
It's hot, come in and have some water.

92
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:42,939
So we sat down in his living room with his wife and we had a talk and he said, you know Rick, I've known you a long time, you've always done good for the community.

93
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:54,669
And he says, I've supported a lot of candidates that I thought were going to be good candidates and do good for the community down here.

94
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:56,910
He says they didn't live up to their promise.

95
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:12,714
After an hour of talking and I made a commitment to him that I would always make sure that I'd be down here and take care of this community as long as I was able to.

96
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:19,880
And I hope Mr. Counts is proud of what he supported 13 years ago.

97
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,902
13 years ago, okay, very good, very good.

98
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:32,829
Family, I know, you know, because you and I, we talk a lot, is a very important element of your life.

99
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:37,691
How do you feel that family life has shaped the person that you are today?

100
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:40,232
Well, you have my wife there.

101
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:43,053
We've been married 47 years.

102
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:46,974
And we were both, we got married young.

103
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:52,356
And I was, you know, young, and my wife,

104
00:10:54,488 --> 00:11:02,113
kind of brought me up, and so I hope that she's proud of the prison that she's developed.

105
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:08,497
My parents gave her a 22 when she was a little boy, and this is what I've grown up to be, and I owe it all to her.

106
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:11,199
Oh my gosh, fantastic, fantastic.

107
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:24,308
Well, you know, you kind of are answering one of the questions that I want to ask you, and maybe you've already answered it in a certain way, but can you talk about who your early role models and heroes were?

108
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:30,196
I didn't really have any early role models or heroes.

109
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:32,620
I'm an only child.

110
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:36,105
My mother passed away a few weeks after I was born.

111
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,075
I don't have like brothers or sisters like other people did.

112
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:45,136
So being in the NHL is a little different.

113
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:48,818
So I didn't really have anyone to look up to.

114
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,299
Just my parents, and that was about it.

115
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:57,943
OK, so we always ask this question when we're with our friends from different places.

116
00:11:58,563 --> 00:11:59,464
Who did you run with?

117
00:11:59,524 --> 00:12:01,625
Who were your pals?

118
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:02,526
Who were your partners?

119
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:17,690
Believe it or not, we still hang with our core group of junior high school friends that moved on to high school, and we go out probably every couple of weeks with our core 10 or 12 people.

120
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,631
And Peter Petrella.

121
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:22,831
I know Petrella.

122
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:23,771
Peter Petrella.

123
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:27,012
Pete was in my class, class of 75.

124
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:27,752
That was the other Peter.

125
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:29,173
There was two Peters.

126
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,975
It was two Peters, that's Peter the Accountant.

127
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:32,775
This is his cousin.

128
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:37,339
Tony Daddario, George Garofalo, Jack Santoro.

129
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:43,664
We started out the Lincoln Junior High and we remained friends forever.

130
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:46,085
All right, all right, cool.

131
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:48,467
That sounds like it would sound if it was coming from me.

132
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:55,032
And then over the years we took in some of the West Bedford kids, The Clocks, Kenny Mayarco.

133
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:57,574
Okay, okay, I knew Kenny Mayarco.

134
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:03,296
And I say, and to this day, we're friends.

135
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,077
And close friends.

136
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:13,779
So you've been doing the work that you've been doing at City Hall for close to a decade and a half.

137
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,420
What has it taught you about yourself?

138
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:24,137
I can tell you now, I'm certainly not the same person I was 12 years ago.

139
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:30,728
I've grown, I've learned, and I've changed my attitude on a lot of things.

140
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:34,787
It's helped me to grow and grow into a different person.

141
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,829
Though I always had a value system, the value system has changed over the years.

142
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:46,131
And again, I always managed to stay involved in the community as I am now.

143
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:47,672
I still belong to the Kiwanis.

144
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:49,373
I still work at the food bank.

145
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:50,773
I do work at the library.

146
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:54,315
So as you know, I've been dedicated to this community my whole life.

147
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:58,156
And I don't come from, my parents never did this.

148
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:06,643
Where it came from is when I was like about 45, and I met a friend of mine.

149
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:10,808
He says, why don't you join a meeting at the corners for us?

150
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:11,589
I gave his number.

151
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:18,796
And it was kind of them who shaped me, because we met every week, and it was a bunch of community members.

152
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:22,659
And I would listen to them, and they would tell the stories of the good things they did.

153
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,064
There was a few political people in there, but they were the ones that actually taught me community service.

154
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:32,707
And I kind of commend them for doing it.

155
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:38,852
Yeah, so when we talk about role models and heroes, perhaps some of your role models and heroes came out of that group.

156
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:44,836
Back then, there was a lot of political people, and there were business and community leaders.

157
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:50,241
I learned from them, and I aspired to be them.

158
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:53,385
I was the young kid back then, and they were all older.

159
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:58,810
But you listen to the stories they would tell, even the politician stories.

160
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,012
They talked about the good things they did.

161
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:10,318
As I tell even my new counselors, there isn't a better feeling than doing something good for somebody who really needs it.

162
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:13,800
And I'm not talking about, you know, like Joe Jones calling, hey, can you fix the pothole?

163
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,963
But somebody who really needs help that doesn't relate to your job as a city.

164
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:23,506
And it's a real good feeling when you do something good for somebody.

165
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:27,850
I've been to a couple of those Kiwanis meetings.

166
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,810
We're a different group.

167
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:33,855
Listen, the one thing that you're guaranteed, okay, is the stories.

168
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:35,056
Absolutely.

169
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:36,977
The other thing is the food, man.

170
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:38,439
Y'all like to eat, man.

171
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,279
You don't remember when

172
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:45,025
Remember the Happy Haddock?

173
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:45,786
We used to meet there.

174
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:46,386
Yeah.

175
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:46,787
Yeah.

176
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,510
And when the Happy Haddock closed, we didn't have a place to go.

177
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:53,095
And the club almost broke up because over the food.

178
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:53,976
Yeah.

179
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:58,381
We were going to eat and finally we ended up going to Bocelli's.

180
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:59,222
Bocelli's, absolutely.

181
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:02,306
Yeah, we were going to different places and the food was

182
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:08,469
was the most important thing and also got the club almost disbanded because we had nowhere to go.

183
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:09,309
That's too funny.

184
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,330
With food.

185
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,430
Yeah, well.

186
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,072
And I say, you know, I think everybody in the room, you know, it's a family thing.

187
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:16,412
We all grew up with food.

188
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:20,474
Food was, you sat around on a Sunday and you had dinner with your family.

189
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,815
I know now that's a forgotten thing, but

190
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:35,688
I think most of the people in this room, remember you went to your grandparents' house on a Sunday for dinner, or they came to yours, and even as a family, you sat down every night and you had dinner together.

191
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:39,691
And again, people, everyone does take out, even my own kids I see.

192
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,136
you know, home-cooked meals.

193
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:46,938
My wife still cooks a meal every night for us and our hosts, and she keeps the tradition going.

194
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:49,198
Trying to get our kids there is a whole nother thing, though.

195
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:50,659
I understand, I understand.

196
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:57,001
But I think it's a tradition, in particular in this community, that's really respected.

197
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:03,802
And like you say, it doesn't happen nearly as often or as much as it used to, but that's the way we grew up.

198
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:05,043
It absolutely is.

199
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:13,467
Okay, so you've been serving the city of Medford for the better part of 12 years, maybe a little bit longer than that.

200
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:18,530
What has that service taught you about the people that live here in Medford?

201
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,393
It's taught me to respect everybody in this community and to be available to everybody.

202
00:17:23,413 --> 00:17:29,036
I think everybody knows part of the thing is Rick always answers the phone when people call.

203
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,057
I'm always available for everybody.

204
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:33,458
If you need something, I'll come to your house.

205
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:34,359
I don't need you to come to me.

206
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,460
And also, I don't like emailing people.

207
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,280
I don't like texting.

208
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:42,201
If you want something, I'd rather talk to you in person.

209
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:45,642
Everybody knows if you need something, I'll be at your house.

210
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:47,183
Anything you ever needed, I'm here.

211
00:17:48,143 --> 00:17:48,683
And that's me.

212
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:50,604
I'm more of a hands-on type person.

213
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:52,084
Okay, okay.

214
00:17:52,844 --> 00:18:05,728
So, you know, and again, I mean, these questions kind of bleed into each other in some ways, but, you know, what made you decide, first decide to get involved with city government and run for city council?

215
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:12,010
Well, as we said earlier, you know, I was always involved with the community and do other things.

216
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:16,862
I did want to do it at an earlier time.

217
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:20,906
I remember, I don't know if you remember, remember when they were doing all the gas work over here?

218
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:23,409
They were tearing up all the streets, putting the gas line in.

219
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:26,852
There may be some folks who remember it better than I do.

220
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:33,879
I was kind of, I kind of got involved with that and I was kind of angry because the gas company just wasn't taking care of the people.

221
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,263
And I was, I had thought about running back then, but

222
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:42,376
You shouldn't run when you're angry or have a cause.

223
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:49,138
You should run because you want to run to do the right thing and not have a cause.

224
00:18:49,318 --> 00:18:53,640
And my kids had all been grown, so I had the time to dedicate to it.

225
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,401
And I felt it was a good move up for me.

226
00:18:57,461 --> 00:19:04,883
And again, my friends at the Kiwanis, they inspired me to do it because I saw them, I saw many of them there.

227
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:08,945
Like I said, we were local leaders at the time.

228
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:11,646
And I think that was just an inspiration for me.

229
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:20,569
So I know that this is kind of subject to change and the landscape is constantly shifting, but

230
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:25,692
share whatever you want to share.

231
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:30,620
What's your current vision for the future of the city of Medford?

232
00:19:33,845 --> 00:19:35,388
One of the things I don't like right now

233
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:40,518
is we've become a community of old Medford and new Medford.

234
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:45,039
And we have a divide in the community, and I don't like the divide.

235
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,399
I didn't grow up in a community that was divided.

236
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,039
I grew up in one community.

237
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:55,640
And that's one of my goals is to bring everybody back to the middle so we're all together as a community.

238
00:19:56,241 --> 00:20:02,702
Even if you just moved here in the last couple of years, people like us who lived here our whole lives, I think we need to be one community.

239
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:11,206
That's one of my biggest things that I'd like to do if I was elected mayor was get the unity back.

240
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:14,729
I want the community that we grew up in where everybody was friendly with everybody.

241
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,131
No more us versus them.

242
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:33,100
So maybe that in some ways at least partially answers the question about how you came to the decision that you wanted to run for mayor.

243
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:46,389
So it really wasn't in my thoughts up until last year.

244
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,751
And after the last election,

245
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:53,885
My vote total was quite high, higher than it had ever been.

246
00:20:54,865 --> 00:21:01,967
And some new people came onto the council, and I had to take the back seat.

247
00:21:02,787 --> 00:21:09,168
I'd always been a leader in the council, and now I was on the minority end.

248
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,909
Welcome to my life, okay?

249
00:21:12,989 --> 00:21:14,370
I was on the minority end.

250
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,951
I didn't like sitting there doing nothing every week.

251
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:28,874
I mean, I voted correctly and everything, but there were some issues that I would have liked to have done, but as they say, if you don't have the votes, you don't have the votes.

252
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:38,438
So that kind of spurned my decision, and we had a little family meeting at the house, and it didn't go over too well.

253
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:48,370
with some members of the family, but I moved on and here I am today.

254
00:21:50,553 --> 00:21:51,854
It's been a tough time.

255
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:54,418
I think my wife will tell you how hard it's been on her.

256
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:58,819
It's been tough on me, I'm out every day, and it's really been pressing.

257
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:02,560
It's a lot harder than I ever thought it was gonna be.

258
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,020
Okay, all right, all right.

259
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:14,823
So you may have, again, you know, because you keep anticipating what I'm gonna ask you, you may already have answered this part of the question, but how does your wife feel about it?

260
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:16,343
How does Carol feel about it?

261
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:35,604
I think she's I think she's on board now okay um and I get it it's hard for her mm-hmm I you know I can't keep dragging her everywhere you know she's got her things to do and she's a grandmother you know and yes and it's

262
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:53,787
Taking her away for some things that she likes to do with the kids and I said listen It's only another month away says we can I said you can't I says you gotta stop being a grandma for like the next five weeks Yeah, which is hard for her because you know, she wants to be the grandma absolutely So it's been a little long a little tough.

263
00:22:53,987 --> 00:22:55,229
Okay on all of us.

264
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:55,269
I

265
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:58,972
All right, all right.

266
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,654
I've never done this before in an interview.

267
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:10,560
In a lot of instances, it's because I don't always have the husband and the wife or the partners in a relationship.

268
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:16,405
So I can't do it, but I can do it tonight because Carol's here too.

269
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:24,211
So what three words would you use to describe Mrs. Caraviello?

270
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:27,283
She's my rock.

271
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:29,404
She's my inspiration.

272
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:30,164
Okay.

273
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:33,585
And again, she inspires me to do better.

274
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,326
Okay, okay, all right.

275
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:38,967
All right, so shout it out, Carol.

276
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:42,888
What three words would you use to describe Rick?

277
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:44,288
She can't say that on TV.

278
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:45,748
Mm-hmm.

279
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,494
I love it.

280
00:24:02,714 --> 00:24:05,536
Okay, all right, there it is, there it is.

281
00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:13,601
So 47 years of marriage is a wonderful thing to make note of.

282
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:20,145
Okay, what do you know now that you wish you had known day one?

283
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:23,407
About my wife?

284
00:24:25,248 --> 00:24:26,869
About being with her, you know.

285
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:27,750
Believe it or not.

286
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,665
I know her better than she knows her.

287
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,366
I know everything about her.

288
00:24:35,286 --> 00:24:39,467
I know, I can tell as soon as I walk in the house with the face on the wall.

289
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:41,688
I said, you know, I write in, I sense the attitude.

290
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:47,589
I can read her to a T. Me, I'm a little more complex.

291
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:55,810
I tell her, I tell her, I says, you know, I says, we've been married 47 years and you still haven't figured me out yet.

292
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,771
I'm a little more complex than she is.

293
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:04,474
I know I can tell, as soon as I walk in the house, I know if this is a situation, if I've done something wrong.

294
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:09,737
Yeah, I only have 37 years in, right?

295
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:11,819
So you got an extra 10 years on me.

296
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:13,680
I think I know.

297
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,361
But they can fool you.

298
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:17,143
No, she can't fool me.

299
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:20,426
I know her to a T. I know.

300
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:24,250
If I had her sitting in this chair, she'd be saying something different, but that's another story.

301
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,152
That's another story for another time.

302
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,193
That's fantastic.

303
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:28,314
That's fantastic.

304
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:34,160
So, you know, you've been at this for a long time and you certainly have got

305
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:42,645
legacy moments, you've got some wonderful things that you've been able to do or be a part of in city government.

306
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:45,607
Talk about two or three of the things that you're most proud of.

307
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:49,947
Probably the most proud of is the Medford Public Library.

308
00:25:50,387 --> 00:25:50,628
Okay.

309
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:59,293
I worked four years to bring that to Medford, going to the conference every year.

310
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:02,555
And there'd be a library table there.

311
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:05,977
It was a convention for municipal governments.

312
00:26:06,157 --> 00:26:06,337
Okay.

313
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:11,408
I would go there and the library would be open.

314
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:13,811
I said, you know, that all these communities were getting libraries.

315
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:16,555
And he says, oh, he says, is Smith on the list?

316
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:17,777
No.

317
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:19,499
Oh, jeez.

318
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,824
So after three or four, after the fourth year,

319
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:25,808
I finally got us on the list.

320
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:32,615
And the library foundation came to MedFed, and they agreed that we needed a library.

321
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:41,706
And this is something, so I brought it to Mayor Burke, and Mayor Burke could have told me, Rick, you know, we're not doing it.

322
00:26:43,206 --> 00:26:52,950
But she took it, and between the two of us, we got the $12 million in upfront financing to get the library.

323
00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:01,532
I also sit on the Memphis Public Library Foundation, I'm the co-chair, and we raised another $6 million to help defray the cost.

324
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:03,273
So in a sense, essentially,

325
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:11,261
City of Medford has a brand new state-of-the-art library for about 45 cents on the dollar, which in today's thing is a steal.

326
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:16,908
And that's probably one of the things I'm most proud of, that I could deliver something that to a community.

327
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,770
As a city councilor, not even as a mayor.

328
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,112
And I thank Mayor Burke for her help in doing that too.

329
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:35,157
I can tell you, with regard to the library, kind of one of the proudest moments that I had as a poet was being asked to write a piece to commemorate the library.

330
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:41,899
And then when the family came to do the dedication, being asked to read some of it.

331
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,288
I think that that library is like, it's a plum.

332
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:53,172
Probably getting about 10,000 people a month that go through there.

333
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,595
We have a dedicated children's library now.

334
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:58,860
You actually have a room where you can have

335
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:04,746
someone like yourself speak, we bring authors in there.

336
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:11,513
Be surprised at the amount of people in this community that don't have access to the internet and don't have access to computers.

337
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:14,015
They go there, they do job interviews there.

338
00:28:15,636 --> 00:28:20,719
You go there between 9 and 11, you can't get in the second floor because it's packed with children.

339
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:24,840
There's maker space, there's private study rooms.

340
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:29,483
It's a great building to be in.

341
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:36,646
That's probably my proudest achievement, that I can bring my own kids back there and say, this is what your father did.

342
00:28:36,826 --> 00:28:37,767
Yeah, yeah.

343
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:44,172
Well, I've had probably three or four different events in the Bonsignori room.

344
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:49,916
It's a great, it's one of the great spaces in Medford now for meetings and gatherings.

345
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:54,400
So if I could give you a little story about the Bonsignori room.

346
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,581
Go for it.

347
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:58,843
We sold everything in the building.

348
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,865
Chairs, anything, anybody want anything?

349
00:29:01,085 --> 00:29:01,885
We sold everything.

350
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:02,446
Name it, name it.

351
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,226
We named everything.

352
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:10,808
I knew Bob Bonsignori a little bit, and he reached out to me and said, geez, Ricky, I'd like to help out in the library, do something.

353
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:11,729
I said, great.

354
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:19,156
I says, I'll have the woman, the fundraiser, she'll give you a call, and whatever you want to do, you do.

355
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:24,581
So I gave him the number, and he calls me back and says, is this guy real?

356
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:25,682
I says, why?

357
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,183
He says, he's donating $400,000.

358
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:31,053
for the room, I said, whoa, Jesus.

359
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:34,096
I was like, taken back.

360
00:29:34,697 --> 00:29:37,600
Because Bob doesn't live, he lives in California now.

361
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:46,450
But yeah, I was taken back when he came back with, he says, if I give you that much money, will you name it after, and he named it after his mother and father.

362
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,472
And he brought her there,

363
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:56,638
before the library opened as a surprise to show her that this is what I did for you as a son.

364
00:29:57,738 --> 00:29:59,619
It was a touching moment.

365
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:06,182
He was one of my guys in high school, Bobby Bonsignore.

366
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:07,943
I was kind of shocked when he came up with that kind of number.

367
00:30:07,963 --> 00:30:12,925
I thought maybe a couple thousand dollars, but when she said that number, I was like, whoa.

368
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:15,206
Next time I ask him for some loot, man, I'm going to start it.

369
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:17,124
He's got plenty.

370
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:18,504
I'm gonna start at a bigger number.

371
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:20,505
I'm thinking small here.

372
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:23,065
Very good, very good.

373
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:35,208
Okay, so as you think about collaborations and community building in the city of Medford, what gives you the most hope?

374
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:39,189
I have hope for our city.

375
00:30:39,969 --> 00:30:44,450
And I want to bring it back

376
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,452
to a time when we're all united together.

377
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:58,845
And again, I think I said this before, I just don't like when I go, even when we have these meetings and people write on social media, you know,

378
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,781
People tell me, one of the knocks on me is, I'm Old Medford.

379
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,082
And I don't understand New Medford.

380
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:09,983
I am Old Medford, I was born and raised here.

381
00:31:10,323 --> 00:31:12,844
A lot of my friends have since all moved away.

382
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:13,984
I chose to stay here.

383
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:17,865
I chose to raise my family here, and send my kids to school here.

384
00:31:18,405 --> 00:31:19,626
I'm really proud of that fact.

385
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:24,647
And when people tell me that I'm Old Medford and I don't get it, they're wrong, I do get it.

386
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:26,228
I do get it, and I want,

387
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:30,289
The new people in Memphis that moved here, I want them to get it too.

388
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:34,770
I want them to know the community that I grew up in and that you grew up in.

389
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,030
Many of these people in this room grew up in.

390
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,050
I want that community back again.

391
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:39,251
I want the closeness.

392
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:41,711
I want people to walk around the streets and be friendly.

393
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:45,812
I don't like when people walk by my house and neighbors and they don't even say hello anymore.

394
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:47,373
You don't know your neighbor anymore.

395
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:48,473
That's not...

396
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:51,195
That's not what I like.

397
00:31:51,716 --> 00:31:53,117
You know me, I'm a friendly guy.

398
00:31:53,397 --> 00:31:56,441
But I want that unity back in our community.

399
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,022
I want the community that I grew up in.

400
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,904
And I want everybody to be together.

401
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,226
Okay, all right.

402
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:04,269
So that's the hope that you have.

403
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,333
Again, it may answer some of the next question.

404
00:32:09,114 --> 00:32:10,255
What gives you Ajita?

405
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:17,333
Um, I don't know.

406
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,855
On a personal basis, or on a government basis?

407
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:25,718
Well, let's try to avoid the politics, because you end up calling somebody a name, and we don't want that.

408
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:32,522
Yeah, kind of on a personal, but kind of an expansive personal basis.

409
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:34,804
What keeps you up late at night?

410
00:32:35,524 --> 00:32:37,786
What makes you take that second antacid?

411
00:32:41,007 --> 00:32:45,349
I'm kind of a sensitive person, and I don't like when people talk bad about our community.

412
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:48,370
That doesn't sit well with me.

413
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,892
Like I said, I take pride in my community.

414
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:59,234
I love and I care, and I have concern for our community.

415
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,455
That's really what keeps me up at night.

416
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:06,437
And again, people know when you call, I want to be there.

417
00:33:08,098 --> 00:33:08,778
I want to help people.

418
00:33:10,078 --> 00:33:16,100
I've made my last probably 35 years of my life helping people.

419
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,240
And I want to continue doing that.

420
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,281
Very good.

421
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:20,001
Very good.

422
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:30,383
How do you think what you've learned during your tenure as a city councilor will inform how you move forward as a potential mayor of Medford?

423
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,403
I've learned a lot, like I said, over the years.

424
00:33:34,043 --> 00:33:36,606
I'm certainly not the same person I was 12 years ago.

425
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:38,368
I've grown on the job, I've learned.

426
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,213
I understand more now how government runs.

427
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:47,319
When you're the new guy, my first year, you had all these ideas.

428
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:49,302
I was going to change the world.

429
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:53,544
And you learn quickly, it's not happening.

430
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:54,445
It's not happening.

431
00:33:55,345 --> 00:34:01,428
The ideas that you have don't come to fruition because I didn't understand how government worked.

432
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:07,791
And people try to equate the private world and the government world.

433
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:10,172
And I come from private business.

434
00:34:11,192 --> 00:34:11,773
It doesn't work.

435
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:14,094
It's not the same mentality.

436
00:34:14,935 --> 00:34:18,678
As a business owner, you make a decision today and it happens tomorrow.

437
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:24,922
You make a decision in government, well, we have to form a committee and do a study or bring in a consultant.

438
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:29,225
So that great idea you had now takes a year and a half to get done.

439
00:34:30,186 --> 00:34:33,228
So that's kind of a frustration that happens.

440
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:41,766
I understand how government works and I understand what it takes to make government better also.

441
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:44,708
That kind of takes me into my next question.

442
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:47,010
You are, you are, you're right ahead of me.

443
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:54,276
So in terms of running your own business, and that's been a benefit to a lot of folks in the community.

444
00:34:54,296 --> 00:35:03,363
We've actually, I wanted to get the ladies an appointment at the salon up in Medford.

445
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:05,584
at the high school.

446
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:17,367
I think this was either the first or the second time we went, and I called you to see about transportation, and you sent limos down.

447
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:18,267
You sent two limos down.

448
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:19,247
Yeah, I sent limos down.

449
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:20,768
And Joe jumped in the car.

450
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:22,008
He was the first guy in the car there.

451
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:52,104
and went, you know, we went to, they call it, I think they called it Mystic Waves at the time, and everybody got, including Joe, everybody got a nice manicure, and it was good, but I think that kind of responsiveness in running your own business and wanting to treat people nice, treat people right, you know, how does that knowledge and that practice translate into running a city?

452
00:35:56,149 --> 00:36:01,373
My dad had a small business and I worked with him.

453
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:05,195
It was mostly a woman-oriented business.

454
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:12,781
He taught me to make sure you don't treat people, treat everybody good.

455
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:15,082
Treat everybody the way you'd want to be treated.

456
00:36:16,303 --> 00:36:18,905
My dad was a tough guy to work for.

457
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:19,886
I'm not gonna tell you he wasn't.

458
00:36:24,013 --> 00:36:27,156
in his generation was work, then family.

459
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:31,860
Because if you didn't work, then, you know, so... You don't work, you don't eat.

460
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,343
The job came first and family came second.

461
00:36:34,383 --> 00:36:35,604
That's how he grew up.

462
00:36:36,204 --> 00:36:40,368
And I took some of that, but, you know, as I...

463
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:45,094
grew older, family came first, and job came second.

464
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:46,394
Dad couldn't understand that.

465
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:51,538
Because if I wanted to be home with the kids, he couldn't grasp that thought.

466
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:58,382
And that's, I think, where we kind of, after a while, I sort of went off into my own and doing something different.

467
00:36:59,423 --> 00:37:04,406
Because Dad just, he was an old school working guy.

468
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:05,787
Works six days a week.

469
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:13,618
I remember my mother, all my other friends, their parents maybe came home at five.

470
00:37:14,118 --> 00:37:15,280
My dad didn't come home till seven.

471
00:37:16,562 --> 00:37:18,285
God bless my mother and my second mother.

472
00:37:21,593 --> 00:37:23,034
she wouldn't eat until he came home.

473
00:37:23,714 --> 00:37:32,720
And she had his dish there, and she had his glass with ice, and as the ice melted, she put more ice in, and as soon as he came in, he would drink Tab, remember Tab?

474
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,021
Yeah, I remember Tab.

475
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:39,144
So he'd drink Tab, and she wouldn't eat until he came home.

476
00:37:39,265 --> 00:37:40,145
Tab and Fresca.

477
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:41,226
Yeah, yeah, that's what he drank.

478
00:37:41,266 --> 00:37:44,068
Yeah, that was my dad, that's what they drank, Tab and Fresca.

479
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,135
A lot of us had dads like that.

480
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:50,136
I know my father was like that.

481
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,836
Loved his family, don't get me wrong.

482
00:37:54,156 --> 00:38:00,578
All of his family, he was a real family guy, but work, he was first.

483
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:08,139
I would shudder to say he was a workaholic, but he was close, he was on the spectrum.

484
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:13,140
But that's what allowed him to provide for his family.

485
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:18,223
And that was the most important thing in the world to him, was being able to provide for his family.

486
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:28,249
But what I did learn from him, even though all the people he had working there, but they all knew if they had a problem, they could go to him.

487
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:34,092
Whether it be a family problem or something, but he would always help out the family if they needed help.

488
00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:38,495
And I think that's something I learned from him.

489
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:41,309
It's beautiful, yeah, absolutely.

490
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:47,953
Okay, so I'm a game player, you probably have figured that out by now.

491
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:51,436
Will you play a little word association with me?

492
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:59,601
Okay, I'm gonna give you the word, you don't have to answer it with a single word, you can be as expansive as you wanna be, but family.

493
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:01,583
Family's very important to me.

494
00:39:03,764 --> 00:39:04,544
It always has been.

495
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:08,065
Again, I was the only child.

496
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:12,987
I didn't have brothers and sisters, so my kids are very important to me.

497
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:14,367
My grandchildren are important to me.

498
00:39:14,507 --> 00:39:15,448
How many grandchildren?

499
00:39:15,648 --> 00:39:16,048
We have eight.

500
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:17,328
Seriously?

501
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:17,468
Yeah.

502
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:19,189
So how many kids?

503
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:19,509
Three.

504
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:21,314
And do they all have?

505
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:21,974
They all have kids.

506
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:22,694
Okay.

507
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:22,995
Yeah.

508
00:39:23,415 --> 00:39:23,675
All right.

509
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,037
So at Christmas time, it's like a full house.

510
00:39:26,677 --> 00:39:37,243
So Christmas time, don't come to my house at Christmas time because every kid has to get like a lot of stuff.

511
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:39,245
They get too many things.

512
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:40,185
Okay, okay.

513
00:39:40,285 --> 00:39:42,767
And I tell my wife, you don't have to buy him that much stuff.

514
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:44,288
I said, they're getting old enough.

515
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:51,398
she won't like this, but my son's 45 and she'll call him up and ask him for his Christmas list.

516
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:53,819
Yeah, he says, stop.

517
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:55,899
What do you want for Christmas?

518
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:56,900
Give me a list for him.

519
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:03,901
And you know, if you grow up in an Italian family, the son is always at the top of the food chain.

520
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:05,082
Yeah, yeah.

521
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:09,523
But she'll call up at Christmas time, you know, I didn't get your list, what do you want for Christmas?

522
00:40:09,723 --> 00:40:10,243
I said, stop, he's 45.

523
00:40:12,728 --> 00:40:15,832
I'm 60 plus but I could still send you my Christmas list.

524
00:40:16,353 --> 00:40:18,475
All right, very good, very good.

525
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:20,738
Okay, laughter.

526
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,604
I'm a pretty, you know me, I laugh all the time.

527
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:27,125
We like to have fun.

528
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:31,298
Okay, okay, good.

529
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,660
It's good.

530
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,881
It's good for the soul.

531
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:34,562
It's good, no, it's good.

532
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,625
Best medicine, absolutely.

533
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:42,351
Some people tell me I don't take things seriously enough.

534
00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:46,216
I do, but we can always have a little levity in anything we do.

535
00:40:46,436 --> 00:40:48,419
Absolutely, I agree with that.

536
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:49,080
Leadership.

537
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:50,617
I think I'm a leader.

538
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,698
I think I'm a very good leader.

539
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:55,439
I've led half a dozen organizations in the city.

540
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,982
And I've left every one of them in a better place than when I started.

541
00:41:00,382 --> 00:41:00,602
All right.

542
00:41:00,762 --> 00:41:02,183
Can't ask for a whole lot more than that.

543
00:41:02,803 --> 00:41:03,203
Courage.

544
00:41:06,384 --> 00:41:07,385
I think I have courage.

545
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,385
I think I have a lot of courage.

546
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:10,866
I took a lot of courage to do what I'm doing now.

547
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:12,906
To stand up and do that.

548
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:20,469
When no one else in the city was standing up to do it, I stood up and said, I want to do this.

549
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:21,609
Okay, okay.

550
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,450
Integrity.

551
00:41:24,631 --> 00:41:25,632
I value my integrity.

552
00:41:26,312 --> 00:41:27,973
I value my reputation.

553
00:41:28,813 --> 00:41:36,058
I've worked very hard to become a well-respected member of this community, and I intend to keep it.

554
00:41:36,338 --> 00:41:47,965
And I say, as you know, I can go into any circle of this community, whether it be this community, the business community, the art community, I'm well-respected no matter where I go.

555
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:53,408
I'm very proud of my integrity in the community.

556
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:53,789
Okay.

557
00:41:54,149 --> 00:41:54,449
Okay.

558
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,370
Very good.

559
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:03,577
So, you know, I think it's only fair, and I try to do this whenever I have a one-on-one interview, is, you know, flip the script.

560
00:42:03,877 --> 00:42:06,299
We do a lot of things down here at the community center.

561
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:09,742
Do you have any questions that you want to ask me tonight?

562
00:42:10,502 --> 00:42:11,824
As you know, I'm here a lot.

563
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,485
I stop in just on the whim.

564
00:42:13,505 --> 00:42:16,968
You know, I know a lot of people in the room.

565
00:42:16,988 --> 00:42:18,689
I know a lot of people that are on that wall.

566
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,402
I really, you know, as you know, I don't really have any questions because I'm here all the time.

567
00:42:25,422 --> 00:42:42,928
And if you've got questions, I ask you and I say, so, you know, you know me, I just, if I drive by, I stop in and say, hello, uh, you know, the, uh, people are having lunch, you know, we come in and we talk and, uh, I'm, you know, I'm glad to, you know, uh, be able to, uh, buy the people here lunches, uh, uh, you know, a few times a year.

568
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:49,931
I'm happy to do it because they're all, everyone here is a good, good people and I respect everybody in the room here.

569
00:42:50,251 --> 00:42:51,272
Very good, very good.

570
00:42:51,352 --> 00:42:54,155
OK, so I'm going to give you the last word.

571
00:42:54,635 --> 00:42:55,837
What are your parting thoughts?

572
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:00,902
I don't know.

573
00:43:00,922 --> 00:43:02,183
I don't really have any.

574
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:03,224
I just want to.

575
00:43:05,171 --> 00:43:08,633
I want to be a valued asset to our community.

576
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:13,715
I want to continue to do good things for the community.

577
00:43:14,716 --> 00:43:18,057
It makes me feel good when I do good things.

578
00:43:18,237 --> 00:43:20,899
Like I said, there isn't a better feeling

579
00:43:22,045 --> 00:43:25,967
than when you actually help someone in real need.

580
00:43:26,347 --> 00:43:33,311
And I'm not saying like political need, but someone who has a real problem that you could step in to help.

581
00:43:33,331 --> 00:43:40,614
Like an example, there was a woman, family getting kicked out of their house.

582
00:43:42,695 --> 00:43:45,297
And they were on a voucher and the rent went up.

583
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:55,161
And the young girl called me and says, they're kicking me out because I no longer meet the standard so I can stay in the house.

584
00:43:55,181 --> 00:43:59,442
But I have the money to pay the extra thing, the extra rent.

585
00:44:00,022 --> 00:44:02,563
And housing authority saying, well, you can't do that.

586
00:44:02,863 --> 00:44:04,764
Even though you have the money, you have to go.

587
00:44:04,804 --> 00:44:10,706
And the young girl didn't have a husband, but she had two kids.

588
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,587
And I went to the housing authority and says,

589
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,702
how can you kick this person out?

590
00:44:18,704 --> 00:44:21,047
And there was a gentleman there who was fairly new.

591
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:24,473
He said, well, it's, you know, she has to, you know.

592
00:44:24,553 --> 00:44:24,933
Okay.

593
00:44:55,848 --> 00:45:05,497
All right, don't die on me now, come on, not under my interview.

594
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:07,800
I don't want to be blamed for this.

595
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,381
We've had a lot of

596
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:16,131
You all right?

597
00:45:16,352 --> 00:45:17,693
Take a moment, relax.

598
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:18,934
Oh my goodness.

599
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:23,217
We've had a lot of things happen to us on this program.

600
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:26,039
This is the first.

601
00:45:28,181 --> 00:45:30,323
Take your time.

602
00:45:38,229 --> 00:45:39,650
You want to delete that part and start again?

603
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:46,435
I will never live this down.

604
00:45:47,776 --> 00:45:48,837
I will never live this down.

605
00:45:49,317 --> 00:45:53,780
I have people walking up to me on the street saying, man, remember that coughing attack you had?

606
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,362
What was up with that, man?

607
00:45:55,402 --> 00:45:57,163
What was going on with you?

608
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:02,197
I said, I had a little cough, I had a little tickle in my throat, and you know.

609
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:12,725
But as I said, the gentleman that was helping her at the housing authority was a new guy, he didn't understand.

610
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:16,207
I said, she's saying I can pay the extra $100.

611
00:46:16,327 --> 00:46:18,989
He said, I don't care if she can pay, she's gotta get out.

612
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,932
And I said, what do you mean she's gotta get out?

613
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:23,872
She's got nowhere to go.

614
00:46:23,892 --> 00:46:25,794
I said, yo,

615
00:46:26,946 --> 00:46:29,187
was supposed to be helping people, not hurting people.

616
00:46:29,827 --> 00:46:36,850
Well, there's nothing I can do, and we went kind of long, and I reached out over his head, and we found there was a way to keep the woman in her house.

617
00:46:37,651 --> 00:46:44,894
And she ended up staying, and she came up to me and hugged me and says, you know, you changed my life, and she thanked me for that.

618
00:46:45,534 --> 00:46:46,715
And those are things that,

619
00:46:48,632 --> 00:46:51,333
It wasn't something, it wasn't a council job.

620
00:46:52,153 --> 00:46:55,614
It was something that you do and say, and those are the things that you want to do.

621
00:46:55,654 --> 00:46:56,435
You want to help people.

622
00:46:57,095 --> 00:46:59,956
Like I said, I'm not talking about fixing a pothole or something straight.

623
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:07,759
Helping someone that doesn't have anything to do with government, that doesn't have access maybe to, call me, can you help?

624
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,600
Senator Maki's office.

625
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,983
And you reach out to them because they don't know how to get in touch with Senator Maki or Representative Clark.

626
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:17,965
And you use influence or whatever.

627
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,387
And that's how you really help people.

628
00:47:20,827 --> 00:47:25,290
And get them to things that doesn't really have anything to do with your city job.

629
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,072
And I take pride in doing that thing.

630
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:30,514
And people know they can call me to get that stuff done.

631
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:31,475
Very good.

632
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:36,118
Well, obviously, the community center

633
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:46,173
has been and really has to remain kind of an impartial entity, not take a particular political stance.

634
00:47:48,294 --> 00:47:50,754
We want everybody to be our friend.

635
00:47:51,595 --> 00:47:53,315
And I think everybody is your friend.

636
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:58,337
Yeah, well, because having friends is what allows us to keep this organization open.

637
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:12,551
So if you have any friends that want to be our friend, especially friends like Bobby Barnes and Uri, or Mayor Bloomberg, feel free to share them with us.

638
00:48:13,051 --> 00:48:14,712
We promise we'll be nice to them.

639
00:48:16,152 --> 00:48:20,673
But Rick, really, thank you so much for bringing your spirit of personal engagement to this community.

640
00:48:20,693 --> 00:48:22,334
Thank you for having me.

641
00:48:22,394 --> 00:48:23,994
I always enjoy coming down here.

642
00:48:24,095 --> 00:48:25,355
Absolutely.

643
00:48:25,415 --> 00:48:27,936
I come here all the time just to say hello.

644
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:37,068
I love the people in this room, a lot of them are my friends and I see them all the time and I thank them for allowing me to be their friend also.

645
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:46,601
Throwing your hat in the Medford-Merrill race has certainly made for a very interesting political season.

646
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:47,401
Yes, it has.

647
00:48:47,481 --> 00:48:51,082
And I think it's been a fairly clean campaign.

648
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:56,044
I have the utmost respect for the mayor, and I'm sure she has the same for me.

649
00:48:56,084 --> 00:49:01,286
And I think you've seen Banter going back and forth.

650
00:49:02,846 --> 00:49:04,948
It hasn't been on each other's character.

651
00:49:04,968 --> 00:49:08,630
We could agree to disagree on the issues, and that's what it's all about.

652
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,172
But not be disagreeable.

653
00:49:11,512 --> 00:49:12,913
Some issues we agree on, some we don't.

654
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:18,057
But we're not attacking each other's character, which is something that's...

655
00:49:19,477 --> 00:49:20,338
not happened in the past.

656
00:49:20,378 --> 00:49:21,058
You got that right.

657
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:24,879
And like I say, I have the utmost respect for her and the job she's doing.

658
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,580
I'm sure she would say the same about you.

659
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,001
I'm sure.

660
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:29,221
Yeah.

661
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:30,661
Okay.

662
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:32,522
And again, thank you.

663
00:49:32,642 --> 00:49:34,042
Thank you everybody for having me here tonight.

664
00:49:34,062 --> 00:49:36,523
It's been an honor and a privilege to be here.

665
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:39,484
And again, win or lose, I'll always be here anyway.

666
00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:40,045
Absolutely.

667
00:49:40,485 --> 00:49:40,985
Absolutely.

668
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:46,830
Okay, folks, so get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin.

669
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,251
We're going to take a break.

670
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:54,416
We're going to reset the stage, and I'll come back and share some West Memphis Community Center announcements.

671
00:49:55,096 --> 00:49:56,418
But thank you for your engagement.

672
00:49:56,438 --> 00:50:02,883
Thank you for listening, and I hope you enjoyed our conversation with Councilor Caravello.

673
00:50:03,403 --> 00:50:03,644
Thank you.

674
00:50:17,907 --> 00:50:19,909
I've had a lot of things happen to me.

675
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:21,950
I've never had that happen to me before.

676
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,692
That's pretty hilarious actually.

677
00:50:46,465 --> 00:50:47,387
like that before.

678
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:50,775
Okay, so I've got that one.

679
00:51:10,507 --> 00:51:11,167
All right.

680
00:51:11,207 --> 00:51:11,987
So is she channel three?

681
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:12,707
She's this one right here?

682
00:51:12,727 --> 00:51:13,708
Yes, she's three.

683
00:51:13,748 --> 00:51:16,708
So these two, oh, we're gonna leave these open.

684
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:17,308
Floor is his.

685
00:51:17,368 --> 00:51:18,028
Okay, perfect.

686
00:51:18,068 --> 00:51:19,929
Cool, we'll use one of these as your MC mic.

687
00:51:41,954 --> 00:51:43,155
Check, check, okay, good.

688
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:46,478
Yeah, those are always fun, aren't they?

689
00:51:46,678 --> 00:51:48,860
Comes out of nowhere.

690
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,763
Out of nowhere, Kevin, my goodness.

691
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:55,186
All right, cool.

692
00:51:55,206 --> 00:51:56,527
That's all right.

693
00:51:56,567 --> 00:52:00,891
Microphone check, one, two, check, one, two.

694
00:52:04,781 --> 00:52:33,154
And Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew, and Andrew

695
00:52:33,434 --> 00:52:37,377
Okay, so, where do you want to be?

696
00:52:37,397 --> 00:52:38,318
Okay, chair, anything?

697
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:40,720
Chair, whatever's good.

698
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,882
If there's water back there, do you need it?

699
00:52:43,902 --> 00:52:44,422
That's fine.

700
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:02,016
Okay.

701
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,197
Oh, I want you.

702
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:37,872
No, no.

703
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:05,828
OK, we're going to get started while I still have a voice.

704
00:54:05,928 --> 00:54:05,968
OK.

705
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:30,491
Okay.

706
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:34,797
All right.

707
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:44,270
All right.

708
00:54:47,908 --> 00:54:56,759
So I just want to go through a few announcements, a couple things I want to share with you, and then we will get back to it.

709
00:54:59,162 --> 00:54:59,603
Seniors.

710
00:55:00,737 --> 00:55:10,185
Wherever you come from, all over the Medford Road map, come join us Tuesday through Thursday for a nutritious lunch and a vibrant fellowship.

711
00:55:10,665 --> 00:55:12,406
Lunch is served at 12 noon.

712
00:55:12,506 --> 00:55:17,951
You can call 781-483-3042 to make a reservation.

713
00:55:18,772 --> 00:55:24,336
And every once in a while, you know, Councilor Caraviello will serve us up a nice buffet.

714
00:55:25,897 --> 00:55:27,458
And he's even cooked himself for us.

715
00:55:30,382 --> 00:55:39,344
Okay, October 20th, we are sponsoring an apple-inspired potluck from 6 to 9 p.m.

716
00:55:39,444 --> 00:55:45,325
Come out and bring your favorite covered dish to share while we peel some apples, okay?

717
00:55:45,405 --> 00:55:52,147
And then on the 21st, we'll take those apples that we peeled and we will make apple butter.

718
00:55:53,098 --> 00:55:53,598
Okay?

719
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:57,301
Music and more fun activities during the day.

720
00:55:58,002 --> 00:56:01,164
There's a flyer on our bulletin board, so check it out.

721
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:11,871
Okay, and then on November 4th, join the Community Center and Mothers Out Front for the annual Medford Pumpkin Smash.

722
00:56:12,712 --> 00:56:13,192
Okay?

723
00:56:13,893 --> 00:56:15,114
Pumpkins get weighed.

724
00:56:15,899 --> 00:56:20,281
They get smashed, and then they get recycled through composting.

725
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:24,763
It's gushy fun for the whole family, okay?

726
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:32,067
Weekly, the new and improved WMCC Fiber Arts Club is open to all.

727
00:56:33,328 --> 00:56:43,813
What began as a group of senior ladies knitting has evolved into a club for anyone that enjoys any type of fiber arts, from crocheting to quilting and beyond.

728
00:56:44,758 --> 00:57:00,182
The group is also engaged in charitable activities, donating time and effort toward bringing their work to nursing homes, chemo and prenatal wards, a fun social activity, and a great community service.

729
00:57:00,242 --> 00:57:05,423
Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, this club would love to have you join.

730
00:57:05,483 --> 00:57:10,765
And that happens on Thursdays at 1 o'clock, right here at the West Memphis Community Center.

731
00:57:14,228 --> 00:57:19,531
We're in the, you know, about the last week of our brick by brick fundraising campaign.

732
00:57:20,032 --> 00:57:28,917
We're going to put another 70-ish commemorative bricks with the existing bricks that we have out there in our front portico.

733
00:57:29,977 --> 00:57:34,760
If you want to participate, four by eight bricks with four lines of text are $100.

734
00:57:36,301 --> 00:57:39,443
8x8 bricks with six lines of text are $225.

735
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:45,266
We're shutting it down probably toward the end of next week, so get on board.

736
00:57:45,767 --> 00:57:47,848
There are still prime spaces left.

737
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,002
and then how you can help us financially.

738
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:56,546
Your tax-deductible donations help support the mission of WMCC.

739
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:59,908
Partner with us in carrying this mission forward.

740
00:57:59,948 --> 00:58:05,372
Please consider making a tax-deductible donation to this vital community organization.

741
00:58:05,432 --> 00:58:08,635
You can make your donation by phone, online, or by check.

742
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:12,838
Please contact Lisa Crossman at 781-483-3042 for more information or to become a member.

743
00:58:12,878 --> 00:58:13,259
All right.

744
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:26,931
So, like I said, while I still have a voice, let's get to the lyrical miracle of the evening.

745
00:58:28,032 --> 00:58:34,896
Farai Malik is a jazz and contemporary vocalist, composer, and music educator.

746
00:58:35,636 --> 00:58:48,764
She received her bachelor's degree in contemporary improvisation from New England Conservatory of Music in 2017, where she studied with vocalist and composer Dominique Ede.

747
00:58:49,384 --> 00:59:04,870
Upon completion, she continued on to receive a master's degree in contemporary performance at Berklee Global Jazz Institute in 2018, under the tutelage of world-renowned pianist and composer Danilo Perez.

748
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:12,350
Since 2018, Farai has been a member of Danilo Perez's Global Messengers.

749
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,251
They are Grammy award winning.

750
00:59:14,311 --> 00:59:15,291
They're international.

751
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:16,472
They're all over the world.

752
00:59:17,172 --> 00:59:18,373
And she's singing with them.

753
00:59:18,613 --> 00:59:19,953
So she got that going for her.

754
00:59:20,654 --> 00:59:25,536
In addition to her performance ventures, Farai is a passionate music educator.

755
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:31,799
In January of 2020, she founded Allegro Virtual Preparatory Instruction, LLC.

756
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:43,213
An online learning platform that strives to provide students with access to the highest possible level of preparation for the study of music in higher education.

757
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:59,067
I met Farai through our mutual friend Stacey Clayton, who has managed to snag several wonderful singers for her annual concerts over at the Somerville Community Baptist Church.

758
00:59:59,848 --> 01:00:05,812
This is her second time singing for First Fridays, but it's her first time live and in person.

759
01:00:07,287 --> 01:00:14,632
Ferrari will be accompanied by the wonderful and equally renowned guitarist and composer, Caio Affioni.

760
01:00:15,193 --> 01:00:20,657
Caio has spent the last 10 years making a lasting impression on the East Coast jazz scene.

761
01:00:21,237 --> 01:00:31,925
Caio has performed extensively as a sideman, accompanying jazz giants such as Jerry Boganzi and Christian Sands, Brazilian legends Jacques and Paula Morellenbaum,

762
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:41,272
and leading his own project, the Caio Afiuna Quintet, as well as collaborating with the international collective Imagine 5.

763
01:00:41,352 --> 01:00:52,621
Originally from Sao Paulo, Brazil, Afiuna's compositions uniquely blend together with the essence of Brazil and his deep knowledge of the North American jazz tradition.

764
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:56,905
I am over the moon to get them here.

765
01:00:57,886 --> 01:00:59,987
I'm so excited to hear them both perform.

766
01:01:00,868 --> 01:01:04,889
I know you will be too, so I'm gonna get out the way and let y'all cook.

767
01:01:19,412 --> 01:01:29,054
The autumn leaves drift by my window

768
01:01:34,687 --> 01:01:47,454
The autumn leaves of red and gold.

769
01:01:50,676 --> 01:01:52,097
I see your lips.

770
01:01:53,717 --> 01:02:01,842
Oh, the summer kisses.

771
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:15,763
the sunburned hands I used to hold.

772
01:02:20,263 --> 01:02:33,906
Since you went away the days grow long and soon I'll hear

773
01:02:34,882 --> 01:03:01,313
♪ Old winter songs ♪ ♪ But I miss you most of all, my darling ♪ ♪ When autumn leaves start to fall ♪

774
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:25,409
The autumn leaves drift by my window The autumn leaves of red and gold I see your lips, the summer kisses

775
01:03:26,912 --> 01:03:32,555
The sunburned hands I used to hold.

776
01:03:35,076 --> 01:03:41,259
And since you went away, the days grow long.

777
01:03:42,579 --> 01:03:48,642
And soon I'll hear old winter's song.

778
01:03:51,243 --> 01:03:54,044
But I miss you most of all.

779
01:03:59,332 --> 01:04:04,536
when autumn leaves start to fall.

780
01:04:38,231 --> 01:04:39,252
do do

781
01:05:14,353 --> 01:05:14,454
do

782
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:27,266
do do do do

783
01:06:50,851 --> 01:06:58,035
The autumn leaves drift by my window The autumn leaves of red and gold

784
01:07:26,491 --> 01:07:32,715
The sunburned hands I used to hold.

785
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:40,721
Oh, but since you went away, the days grow long.

786
01:07:41,842 --> 01:07:48,446
And soon I'll hear old winter songs.

787
01:07:49,547 --> 01:07:54,731
But then I'll miss you most of all, my darling.

788
01:07:57,844 --> 01:08:17,698
When autumn leaves start to fall When autumn leaves start to fall When autumn leaves start

789
01:08:32,048 --> 01:08:33,088
Thank you so much.

790
01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:38,109
Thank you, Terry, for having us.

791
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:44,811
It's it's such a pleasure and a joy to be here and to be here with one of my dear friends, Kyo.

792
01:08:44,971 --> 01:08:48,952
So we're so happy to be performing this set of music for you.

793
01:08:48,972 --> 01:08:51,892
We've got some jazz standards, a couple original compositions for you.

794
01:08:51,932 --> 01:08:52,732
We hope you enjoy.

795
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:57,253
That was Autumn Leaves, as requested by Terry.

796
01:08:57,353 --> 01:08:59,114
And then we're going to do another one of your requests.

797
01:08:59,254 --> 01:09:00,554
This is God Bless the Child.

798
01:09:12,059 --> 01:09:13,540
do do

799
01:09:28,211 --> 01:09:34,593
them that's not shall get, them that's not shall lose.

800
01:09:35,613 --> 01:09:43,156
So the Bible says, and it still is news, yes.

801
01:09:43,996 --> 01:09:53,299
Because mama may have and papa may have, but God bless the child.

802
01:09:54,921 --> 01:09:57,022
It's got his own.

803
01:09:57,042 --> 01:10:04,825
It's got his own.

804
01:10:06,365 --> 01:10:12,047
Yes, the strong gets more while the weak ones fade.

805
01:10:13,988 --> 01:10:16,009
The empty pockets don't.

806
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:37,717
Dare ever make the greatest Mama may have and Papa may have But God bless the child that's got his own That's got his own

807
01:10:52,545 --> 01:11:10,356
and they're crowding around the door now when you're gone and spinning ends they don't come no more

808
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:19,806
Rich relations give crusts of bread and such.

809
01:11:20,706 --> 01:11:27,810
You can help yourself, but don't take too much.

810
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:28,991
No, no, no, no, no.

811
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:41,699
Because mama may have and papa may have, but God bless the child that's got his own.

812
01:11:42,935 --> 01:11:45,199
That's got a soul

813
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:44,022
you

814
01:13:29,384 --> 01:13:29,445
you

815
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:39,175
Money, you've got lots of friends And they're crowded round the door Now when you're gone and spending ends They don't come no more

816
01:14:42,242 --> 01:14:46,684
Rich relations give, crust of bread and such.

817
01:14:47,965 --> 01:14:56,230
You can help yourself, but don't take too much, no.

818
01:14:57,150 --> 01:15:09,857
Because mama may have, papa may have, but God bless the child that's got his own.

819
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:17,419
God bless the child that's got his own.

820
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:27,261
God bless the child that's got his own.

821
01:15:27,601 --> 01:15:37,002
That's got his own.

822
01:15:40,723 --> 01:15:41,543
Thank you so much.

823
01:15:52,659 --> 01:15:54,960
This is one of my very favorite ballads.

824
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,881
This one's Skylark.

825
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:41,154
Skylark, have you anything to say to me?

826
01:16:44,575 --> 01:16:48,737
Won't you tell me where my love can be?

827
01:16:54,039 --> 01:17:05,643
Is there a meadow in the midst where someone's waiting to be kissed?

828
01:17:05,723 --> 01:17:17,467
Oh, Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring?

829
01:17:21,562 --> 01:17:43,692
where my heart can go a journey over the shadows and the rain to a blossom cover lane and in your lonely flag

830
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:54,156
Haven't you heard the music in the night?

831
01:17:54,236 --> 01:18:13,250
Wonderful music, faint as a will-o'-the-wisp, crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon.

832
01:18:21,255 --> 01:18:34,129
I don't know if you can find these things, but my heart is riding on your wings.

833
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:42,838
So if you see them anywhere, won't you leave?

834
01:19:27,722 --> 01:19:28,223
Buh-bye

835
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:17,069
And in your lonely flight, haven't you heard the music in the night?

836
01:21:17,269 --> 01:21:35,323
Wonderful music, faint as a will-o'-the-wisp, crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the

837
01:21:38,682 --> 01:22:06,152
Skylark I don't know if you can find these things But my heart is riding on your wings So if you see them anywhere

838
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:25,907
Thank you.

839
01:22:25,927 --> 01:22:27,689
Kayo, happy uni.

840
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:38,618
So we're going to do a little Stevie Wonder tune now, one of my favorites.

841
01:22:41,261 --> 01:22:42,182
This is Overjoyed.

842
01:23:00,829 --> 01:23:23,544
Over time, I've been building my castle of love just for two, though you never knew you were my reason.

843
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:25,826
I've gone much too far.

844
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:36,488
now to say that I've got to throw my castle away.

845
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:42,073
I have picked out a perfect come true.

846
01:23:45,617 --> 01:23:52,103
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming.

847
01:23:57,441 --> 01:24:07,986
The sad man has come from too far away for you to say come back some other day.

848
01:24:08,007 --> 01:24:14,230
And though you don't believe that they do, they do come true.

849
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:19,472
For did my dreams come true when I looked at you?

850
01:24:19,873 --> 01:24:22,254
And baby, to whether you would believe

851
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:42,041
You too might be overjoyed, over love, over me.

852
01:24:42,721 --> 01:24:49,706
Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone.

853
01:24:53,959 --> 01:25:03,724
just to find that I found what I've searched to discover.

854
01:25:05,805 --> 01:25:16,490
I've come much too far for me now to find the love that I sought can never be mine.

855
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:19,211
And though you don't believe that they do,

856
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:45,292
they do come true for did my dreams come true when I looked at you and maybe to whoever you would believe you too might be oh for joy oh for love over me and though the

857
01:25:49,131 --> 01:26:07,960
What do they know, foreign romance All true love needs is a chance And maybe with a chance you will find You too like I overjoyed, overloved

858
01:26:36,395 --> 01:26:36,875
East of the sun.

859
01:26:36,915 --> 01:26:38,216
East of the sun.

860
01:26:38,296 --> 01:26:40,917
I'm going to pick it up.

861
01:26:40,957 --> 01:26:42,418
I'll do another one of my favorite standards.

862
01:26:42,438 --> 01:26:44,059
This one's East of the sun.

863
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:47,640
E flat.

864
01:26:48,241 --> 01:26:58,465
Want to take a course on that?

865
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:01,887
One, two, one, two, three.

866
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:08,659
do do

867
01:27:51,095 --> 01:27:55,578
East of the sun and west of the moon.

868
01:27:57,699 --> 01:28:01,922
We'll build a dream house of love, dear.

869
01:28:01,942 --> 01:28:08,206
Close to the sun in the day, near to the moon at night.

870
01:28:08,726 --> 01:28:11,508
We'll live in a lovely way, dear.

871
01:28:11,768 --> 01:28:14,450
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight.

872
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:18,973
Just you and I, forever and a day.

873
01:28:20,806 --> 01:28:25,207
Our love will not die, because we'll keep it that way.

874
01:28:25,227 --> 01:28:32,229
Up among the stars, we'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune.

875
01:28:32,769 --> 01:28:37,830
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear.

01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:41,891
East of the sun and west of the moon.

East of the sun and west of the moon dear, we'll build a dream house of love dear.

881
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:02,641
love will not die cause we'll keep it that way.

882
01:31:02,661 --> 01:31:10,123
Up among the stars we'll shine in harmony of life to a lovely tune.

01:31:10,663 --> 01:31:16,265
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear.

East of the sun and west of the moon, dear.

East of the sun and west

886
01:31:37,162 --> 01:31:37,562
Thank you.

887
01:31:37,582 --> 01:31:44,186
We're going to change it up a little and do an original of mine.

888
01:31:44,686 --> 01:31:46,347
This is entitled Tonight.

889
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:49,028
And if you like it, you can find it on YouTube.

890
01:31:49,609 --> 01:31:52,831
It's under my name and the Salt Lick Sessions.

891
01:31:53,551 --> 01:32:00,215
I'm going to be recording it later this year in December for my debut album, which will be coming out next year.

892
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:02,636
So thank you.

893
01:32:17,113 --> 01:32:22,137
Tonight, I sang the melodies I wrote for you.

894
01:32:22,478 --> 01:32:25,320
Nothing left unsaid.

895
01:32:26,341 --> 01:32:30,265
Still, I'm going home alone tonight again.

896
01:32:30,285 --> 01:32:34,628
They had had it all.

897
01:32:49,445 --> 01:32:57,488
I look out and see unfamiliar silhouettes of people in the crowd.

898
01:32:58,668 --> 01:33:04,090
The ghost of you dancing in the shadows on the street.

899
01:33:05,211 --> 01:33:14,234
The cold nights get lonely and I know you'd be here with me if you could.

900
01:33:15,776 --> 01:33:25,406
And when my moon is rising, your sun is shining, and the joys of summer days are still with you.

901
01:33:26,327 --> 01:33:35,938
And so my heart grows weary, but I can imagine your voice whispering sweeter things in my ear.

902
01:33:47,059 --> 01:33:54,924
Tonight I heard a melody reminding me of you.

903
01:33:56,485 --> 01:34:00,467
And here I sit longing to be alone with you.

904
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:08,772
The sound of your voice lingers in my mind.

905
01:34:09,653 --> 01:34:12,315
It's music to my ears.

906
01:34:13,672 --> 01:34:19,935
How long will I be lonesome for a season, for a year?

907
01:34:20,635 --> 01:34:29,199
The cold nights get lonely and I know you'd be here with me if you could

908
01:34:31,248 --> 01:34:41,136
And when my moon is rising, your sun is shining, and the joys of summer days are still with you.

909
01:34:42,197 --> 01:34:53,065
So my heart grows weary, but I can imagine your voice whispering sweeter things in my ears.

910
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:57,208
And that you.

911
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:04,120
here.

912
01:35:48,677 --> 01:35:48,738
you

913
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:29,187
Oh, you'd be here with me if you could.

914
01:36:30,728 --> 01:36:40,292
And when my moon is rising, your sun is shining, and the joys of summer days are still with you.

915
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:52,618
And so my heart grows weary, but I imagine your voice whispering sweet nothings in my ears.

916
01:37:04,836 --> 01:37:18,309
just for you here inside my head sitting here at home alone tonight again.

917
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:26,256
Thank you.

918
01:37:36,886 --> 01:37:41,689
This is one of my favorite standards that didn't make the list somehow, but I felt like doing it.

919
01:37:41,729 --> 01:37:42,489
So we're going to do it for you.

920
01:37:42,509 --> 01:37:49,433
I'll start right on that one.

921
01:37:49,453 --> 01:37:49,613
One, two.

922
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:55,211
Grab your coat and get your hat.

923
01:37:56,332 --> 01:37:59,573
Leave your worries on the doorstep.

924
01:38:00,193 --> 01:38:06,475
Just direct your feet to the sunny side of the street.

925
01:38:06,575 --> 01:38:11,817
Can't you hear that pitter pat and that happy tune?

926
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:20,213
Life can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street.

927
01:38:20,853 --> 01:38:28,238
I used to walk in the shade with those blues on parade.

928
01:38:28,938 --> 01:38:31,820
Oh, but I'm not afraid.

929
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:35,502
This rover crossed over.

930
01:38:37,483 --> 01:38:39,664
If I never had a sense.

931
01:38:41,876 --> 01:38:49,984
Rich as Rockefeller, gold dust at my feet, on the sunny side of the street.

Just outrank your feet to the sunny side of the street.

Yes, absolutely.

951

We got another one for you.

952
01:43:22,932 --> 01:43:26,853
This is one of my favorite old gospel tunes.

Come on, sing with me.

01:45:08,131 --> 01:45:19,637
To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away.

957
01:45:25,657 --> 01:45:34,285
I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.

958
01:45:35,165 --> 01:45:42,031
When I die, hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away.

959
01:45:55,697 --> 01:46:12,452
weary days and then I'll fly away to a home where joy shall never end.

960
01:46:12,552 --> 01:46:17,797
I'll fly away.

961
01:46:30,731 --> 01:46:35,334
fly away.

962
01:46:35,394 --> 01:46:41,357
When I die, hallelujah by and by.

963
01:47:08,254 --> 01:47:08,414
Mm!

964
01:47:08,474 --> 01:47:08,554
Mm!

965
01:47:43,952 --> 01:47:44,452
Sing with me.

966
01:47:46,353 --> 01:47:53,595
Oh, I'll fly away, oh, glory.

967
01:47:55,816 --> 01:48:01,017
I'll fly away.

968
01:48:01,138 --> 01:48:06,919
When I die, hallelujah, bye, bye.

969
01:49:03,147 --> 01:49:04,448
Thank you, Terry, for having us.

970
01:49:07,089 --> 01:49:07,949
Thank you for listening.

971
01:49:13,631 --> 01:49:14,211
Okay, so...

972
01:49:17,032 --> 01:49:37,936
One of the things that I, you know, kind of have prided myself on since we began this venture probably close to 65 shows ago, we've done five plus years of shows, is not putting anything in front of you that I would be ashamed, you know, for you to see.

973
01:49:38,736 --> 01:49:41,557
So, and obviously this night is no different.

974
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:42,937
I mean, this is high level

975
01:49:43,681 --> 01:49:45,741
high-level, high-level stuff.

976
01:49:46,822 --> 01:49:58,064
So I just, I want to say thank you to Farai and to Kayo, you and that marvelous guitar of yours, for a really, really wonderful night of music.

977
01:49:58,584 --> 01:50:02,745
I appreciate you both, and I hope if I ask again, you'll come again.

978
01:50:02,765 --> 01:50:05,326
All right, very good, very good.

979
01:50:05,926 --> 01:50:10,007
Ladies and gentlemen, Farai Malek and Kayo Afeyouni.

980
01:50:10,207 --> 01:50:11,347
Kayo Afeyouni.

981
01:50:16,113 --> 01:50:25,375
Okay, so that's a wrap for this live edition of WMCC's Monthly Words of Music program.

982
01:50:25,775 --> 01:50:27,455
We're so happy to be back in the game.

983
01:50:27,535 --> 01:50:28,196
I'm serious.

984
01:50:28,556 --> 01:50:36,897
Visiting with you in your living rooms and your other household spaces, as well as being here at our second home, the West Medford Community Center.

985
01:50:37,338 --> 01:50:42,979
I want to thank my man Kevin Harrington back there and Medford Community Media.

986
01:50:44,079 --> 01:50:46,300
for helping us to be live on local cable.

987
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:55,486
And to thank you all for coming out and spending another night with us, enjoying what the WMCC has to offer.

988
01:50:56,066 --> 01:51:08,774
And if heck doesn't freeze over and I can stop myself from coughing, we'll be back in November with another edition of First Friday's Words and Music, featuring the sitting mayor, Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

989
01:51:09,714 --> 01:51:16,762
Okay, before we fade to black, here's one more reminder about what's happening next at the WMCC.

990
01:51:17,523 --> 01:51:28,335
First and foremost, this program is supported in part by a grant from the Medford Arts Council, a local commission that is supported by the Massachusetts Cultural Council and the city of Medford.

991
01:51:30,723 --> 01:51:34,445
October 20th, the Apple Potluck from 6 to 9.

992
01:51:34,565 --> 01:51:40,348
Come out and bring your favorite covered dish to share with your neighbors while we peel apples.

993
01:51:40,809 --> 01:51:49,494
And then on the 21st, we'll turn those apples into apple butter with other fun activities and the music, of course.

994
01:51:50,534 --> 01:51:56,539
November 4th, join WMCC and Mothers Out Front for the annual Medford Pumpkin Smash.

995
01:51:57,079 --> 01:52:01,743
Pumpkins get weighed and smashed and then recycled through composting.

996
01:52:02,383 --> 01:52:04,505
It's gushy fun for the whole family.

997
01:52:05,326 --> 01:52:10,830
And then finally, the WMCC Fiber Arts Club is open to all.

998
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:18,696
What began as a group of senior ladies knitting has evolved into a club for anyone that enjoys any type of fiber arts.

999
01:52:19,116 --> 01:52:32,648
From crocheting to quilting and beyond, the group is also engaged in charitable activities, donating time and effort to bring their work to nursing homes and other places that might need it.

1000
01:52:32,668 --> 01:52:39,454
A fun social activity and a great community service, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, the club would love to have you.

1001
01:52:40,915 --> 01:52:45,299
And we are in the last few days of our brick-by-brick fundraising campaign.

1002
01:52:45,719 --> 01:52:50,404
Another 70-ish commemorative bricks are being added to our front portico.

1003
01:52:51,024 --> 01:52:55,649
If you want to participate, four-by-eight bricks with four lines of text are $100.

1004
01:52:56,610 --> 01:53:00,213
Eight-by-eight bricks with six lines of text are $225.

1005
01:53:01,254 --> 01:53:04,937
We're shutting it down toward the end of next week, so get on board.

1006
01:53:05,658 --> 01:53:06,758
That's all, folks.

1007
01:53:07,158 --> 01:53:15,100
Join the set of November for our conversation with Mayor Kern, Lingo Kern, on a new edition of First Fridays, Words and Music.

1008
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:20,961
Send us your email addresses if you want to be included in our regular constant contact connection.

1009
01:53:21,401 --> 01:53:23,762
You can also call us at 781-483-3042.

1010
01:53:23,942 --> 01:53:32,303
For Lisa and myself and Kevin, good night, be safe, and stay healthy.

1011
01:53:32,343 --> 01:53:34,284
We hope to see you again soon.
