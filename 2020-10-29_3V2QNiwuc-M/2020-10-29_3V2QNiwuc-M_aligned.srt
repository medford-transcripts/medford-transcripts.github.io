1
00:00:02,225 --> 00:00:05,029
Hello, good evening.

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:06,611
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:09,594
Hopefully you are joining us live.

4
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:19,366
As discussed at the school committee meeting and other communications, tonight is a night to have a forum with our class of 2021.

5
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:26,478
to discuss events, to discuss some concerns, to discuss things that are working.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,826
As you can see here, there are multiple administrators here as well as class advisors and a class officer.

7
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:42,092
We encourage you to put comments in that we will try to answer as we go through tonight.

8
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:47,837
We also have questions that were given to us previously through info at medford.k12.ma.us.

9
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,002
that we will try to answer.

10
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:57,125
If we're not jumped on it right away, please make sure you put it in the comments for us to review.

11
00:00:57,205 --> 00:01:05,430
So we will wait and we will try to answer any questions that come up on comments so that we can address what you're looking for.

12
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,291
Oh, hi, Gabby.

13
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:10,593
Gabby's a class officer as well.

14
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:33,176
So, I don't see any comments yet, so let's try to... So, Mr. DeLeva, can we just do some quick introductions, if I can put out there to the audience there, that we have Lacey Intapa, who is the Senior Class Vice President, Class 2021, and Gabby Yamamoto, who is the Senior Class Secretary.

15
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,320
Also, the co-advisors, the extraordinarily hardworking Riley Jones and Cheryl Giordano.

16
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,703
And of course, you know me, you know Mr. Fallon, Mr. DeLeva,

17
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:47,150
Of course, Dr. Cushing, our assistant superintendent and our assistant director principal vocational school, Ms.

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,830
Fitzpatrick.

19
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:54,857
So just a quick shout out and recognition to our hardworking team, in particular the students who have really been stepping up so far.

20
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:56,919
Thank you.

21
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,384
So probably a good thing, because again, I don't see comments, but a lot of things have been about events.

22
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:03,886
So maybe we talk a little bit.

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:12,022
start off with events and then if there's anything regarding other aspects of the high school or the vocational school we can definitely try that.

24
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:19,284
So does somebody want to take it away and just do a little bit of an overview of things that we were talking about regarding events?

25
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:21,985
I'm happy to get that started.

26
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:23,846
Great, thank you.

27
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:24,086
So

28
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:25,907
I know some of you will know me.

29
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:26,888
I'm Cheryl Giordano.

30
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:28,188
I'm a teacher at the high school.

31
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:37,831
I've been with the class since our freshman year and we are really blessed with a group of students who are creative and out of the box thinkers.

32
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:41,253
So I think that while this year will be very different.

33
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:42,053
I think we don't

34
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:46,545
We couldn't ask for anything more from a group of kids to be able to do this.

35
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:49,246
So we're very pleased with some of the ideas that they've come up with.

36
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:58,068
I just want to give you an overview that we're thinking already about some events for the fall, things that are outdoors, socially distanced.

37
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:02,789
We might need to limit numbers a little bit to be in compliance with the Medford public health guidelines.

38
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:06,570
So we want to try and offer multiple smaller events

39
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:10,660
so that students might not be able to go to everything, but they can go to something.

40
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,421
That is kind of our goal there.

41
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:19,626
I know there have been lots of questions and comments about prom or some sort of senior dance.

42
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:23,268
And I do want to let you know that we are thinking about that.

43
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:26,530
We've been talking about it with Mr. Black and Mr. Patrick.

44
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,871
That is definitely on our mind.

45
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:30,644
May is also a long time away, right?

46
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:35,505
So what will happen in May is what's going to happen in May, but we will do something.

47
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:49,510
Whatever we can hobble together under the circumstances we find ourselves in, we will do something to help these wonderful students mark the end of what has been a very long journey for them in terms of getting a public education.

48
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:55,190
So I wanted to throw it now to our two students who are here.

49
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,854
They've come up as part of the team with some wonderful ideas for the fall.

50
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:06,160
So Lacey or Gabby, would one of you like to talk about a couple of the ideas for this fall?

51
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:10,634
Um, yeah, I can talk about a couple of ideas we've gone through.

52
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:15,296
So, something that was requested a lot was a senior sunrise.

53
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:19,578
Which we are really excited about hopefully starting a new tradition at the high school.

54
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,900
And so basically, we're all going to get together 1 morning.

55
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,403
In November, a Saturday morning, and we are going to watch the sunrise together.

56
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:30,384
Um, just as a nice.

57
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:33,443
beginning of the year event that we can all do together.

58
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:36,984
And we have also started planning a drive-in.

59
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:46,447
So we are hoping to show a movie at the high school and have people in the parking lot just to have together.

60
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:48,480
Yeah, to add on.

61
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:58,709
With the senior sunrise, we're hoping to also have another event at the end of the year, which would be a senior sunset to kind of celebrate the seniors in their senior year, you know, rising and then leaving.

62
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:08,437
Also with the drive-in, we have a tentative date for the day, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, that's going to be probably held within the high school parking lot.

63
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:12,621
And we're also, it's going to be a free event, but we're going to also be selling concessions.

64
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:19,251
So I'll jump in there because there's a question about NHS induction.

65
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:30,059
Our goal is to follow the guidelines and have this event occur, again, as long as we're just in compliance with what happens.

66
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:44,749
The tough part will be, excuse me, is determining the venue, depending on what the current theater has the ability to do, or we put it in a different area within the building.

67
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:51,796
but we are looking to host events, certain events that we know we can be in compliance for.

68
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,780
I think you're muted there, Mr. Gluck.

69
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:04,701
Thank you.

70
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:05,581
Thank you, Mr. Leib.

71
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,343
So good evening parents and everyone else watching, students.

72
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:15,005
We appreciate your presence here and thank you for bringing this forward as something that you were looking forward to.

73
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:16,149
having with us.

74
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,550
I think I just sort of want to speak in broad terms.

75
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:26,311
I feel like I want to give a lot of credit to every single person who is doing something to make the school year work in some way.

76
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:30,612
And that is everybody in some part and to some extent.

77
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:44,474
Figuring out how to make this work with the new set of circumstances, obviously much credit to anyone involved with advancing senior activities, whether it's at school level or whether there's caring parents who coalesce together to try to find some way to make this work.

78
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:54,291
You know, so I think that, you know, one thing to just put out to the group is that a lot of work has happened, will continue happening.

79
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:58,894
And I hope tonight we can just shape some of the direction that people really would like to see happening.

80
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:04,196
If I can just jump in on some of the questions so far.

81
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:09,559
So, you know, a student question from Aiden just regarding senior events in the winter, considering it will be cold outside.

82
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,282
You know, I think to myself, there's some friends of ours who are from,

83
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:19,149
you know, Calgary, who, uh, you know, laugh at us when we talk about indoor dining closing, cause it's too cold.

84
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:25,132
You know, I think we need to, we need to be creative and resilient and maybe there's some way to do some fun events outside, even if it is a little bit chilly.

85
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:31,836
You know, we luck out and get a balmy night, but, you know, we think to ourselves, what can work, what can be safe and, uh, plan it, plan a makeup night.

86
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:35,018
If it's a little tough, um, you know, the weather's truly bad.

87
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:41,382
Um, but you know, just like Lacey was saying, looking forward and Gabby was saying, looking forward to things where we can do a socially distant.

88
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,182
because that's truly, you know, I think right now what we have to work with, you know, we can't expect otherwise.

89
00:07:47,463 --> 00:08:02,229
I think we could also think about things, and I know it's tough, but I mean, rentals of certain tents, space heaters, I mean, those are ideas that are outside of the box that, you know, need to be a little bit different.

90
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:07,592
I mean, in my thought process, you know, we could definitely decorate the parking lot better than

91
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:13,917
know, the way it's looked in the past for just parking cars or things up on the field.

92
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:23,160
I think this is a time for us to be creative as best that we can and think a little bit outside than our norm.

93
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:31,423
I'll just also throw in that this gives us the opportunity to also take advantage of the cold, right?

94
00:08:31,463 --> 00:08:31,683
Like

95
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:44,049
First blizzard comes there's no reason why we can't have small pockets of seniors meeting at local parks around the city to have no man building contest right but then like feeds into a virtual piece so like.

96
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:50,895
I think that yes, cold outside is an element we have to consider, but I don't think it has to mean that we can do nothing.

97
00:08:51,335 --> 00:08:57,462
It just means that we have to get, like people are saying, more creative and use that cold to help spur on ideas.

98
00:08:57,482 --> 00:09:06,472
And just to add to that, I think also with the students, much credit to them, they've been creative and coming up with new ideas and new things to start.

99
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:15,779
you know, ideas of putting events in different areas of Bedford so that each kind of group of students feels like something happens in their own part of the city.

100
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:28,389
And so we're definitely gonna keep trying to be as creative, like Cheryl said, as possible and opening it up to, you know, community and student, you know, ideas and requests as well.

101
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,131
Can I- I think- Oh, go ahead.

102
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:31,291
Sorry.

103
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:38,010
This year has also proven that we can do things virtually, and there's nothing wrong with doing things virtually.

104
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,091
People should always keep their eye on the senior class Instagram.

105
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,192
We're always running events.

106
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:45,393
We're always trying to get people together without getting together.

107
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:49,875
Can I speak to the senior 60 hour requirement?

108
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:57,038
I would like to follow up on that question with Stacey Shulman, our director of guidance and clinical services, just to make sure we know what's going on with that.

109
00:09:57,058 --> 00:09:58,799
I think there has to be some flexibility there.

110
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,940
There's really no doubt about that, especially if kids were

111
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:09,835
interfered with the pandemic and we're looking to do some service, that is something where I think there's just going to require some amount of flexibility and accommodation.

112
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,217
So I'll plan to update the senior community when I know more there.

113
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:19,882
Right, and to follow up too, it's something that we just don't wanna waive right away.

114
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:24,965
I think, as Mr. Blau said, it's more of flexibility and accommodation.

115
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:27,487
And again, another thing of thinking outside of the box,

116
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:32,599
where I just don't wanna just right away take it away.

117
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:36,281
It is within our graduation requirements.

118
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:43,906
I think last year, we knew that some students were never gonna be able because we just were never sure what was gonna happen.

119
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:48,009
So we had to kind of think about waiving that requirement.

120
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:55,614
But this being a full year, I just wanna make sure that we're thinking and not just taking that off the table.

121
00:10:56,275 --> 00:11:05,482
So I think, yes, as Mr. Blauck said, following up with Mrs. Shulman, I think as an admin team, we're going to have to sit down together and kind of make a determination.

122
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:08,064
Maybe the hours are lessened.

123
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:19,953
Regarding that I saw someone do something with getting supplies to our school and donating, and that was more of a CCSR project, but that doesn't mean that that's limited

124
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,081
to just the CCSR.

125
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:24,083
Students can do, you know, individual things.

126
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:37,172
I mean, even if, like you're saying, you're hosting a virtual story reading for students, you know, those are younger students, you know, those are things that, you know, we get to think outside the box.

127
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:47,800
So we will definitely, you know, inform you regarding that requirement, but we definitely want to kind of not make sure we take it off the table right away.

128
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:52,259
Someone's asked about clubs and activities.

129
00:11:52,619 --> 00:12:00,224
So our game plan for that is that Mr. Fallon and Mr. DeLeva will be coordinating a master list of clubs and activities that we will publish to the school community.

130
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,226
Some clubs have already launched.

131
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:15,914
The important thing is just to systematize that around exactly how things are launching, how do you get contact information, where are things meeting, whether they're virtual, if we're going to do in-person, what would be the safety measures and protocols there.

132
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,876
So that's something again that we, you know,

133
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:29,206
I don't want to make excuses, but there's a lot of things that are happening now and clubs and activities are something that we've, you know, more recently in the past two weeks or so, I've been coordinating to prepare some sort of master document.

134
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:31,127
That's just to help Emma with her question.

135
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:34,669
And we do have some clubs that are currently running.

136
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:44,137
like the Asian Club is currently running, the Anime Club is currently running, the Gay-Straight Alliance is currently doing events.

137
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:54,465
So we do have small pockets of clubs that are going through, but I think as what Mr. Blount said, that we make sure that our master list is out there for you, so you're aware.

138
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:58,688
I know that some club members reach out to other club members, and so that's how that's known.

139
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:02,791
I try to post things out too from emails.

140
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:04,473
I know the students get an email from me

141
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:12,508
every morning and it started off as like who's absent but now it's turned into a let me give you some information kind of thing.

142
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:18,071
So I always encourage students to check their morning emails just to get that information as well.

143
00:13:22,498 --> 00:13:34,166
Um, there was, since people may have joined, it's been about 10 minutes in, um, Dave did, Mr. Blount did a great job giving some introductions for us earlier, but maybe we can go around from the top clockwise, maybe starting with Ms.

144
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:38,569
Giordano and take a moment to, um, just reintroduce everybody.

145
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:41,170
So, um, I am Cheryl Giordano.

146
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,832
Uh, I am one of the faculty advisors for the class of 2021.

147
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:48,455
Um, and I am an English teacher at the high school.

148
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:55,526
Oh, am I at the top here?

149
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:56,887
I just want to make sure.

150
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:59,089
Yeah, I think you're next, Mr. DeLava.

151
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:00,230
I'm Paul DeLava.

152
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,532
I'm principal of the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

153
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:05,894
I'm glad to have this forum with everybody.

154
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:11,878
Hi, I'm Lacey Antapa.

155
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:18,063
I am the senior class vice president, and I'm new to the council this year, but I'm really excited about getting this year going.

156
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:23,046
Hi, I am Riley Jones.

157
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:28,047
I am a history teacher and co-advisor with Sheryl this year.

158
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:36,570
I'm really excited to work with these students because they've been absolutely wonderful and very hardworking.

159
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,852
Hi, I'm Alice Beth Fitzpatrick.

160
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:47,313
I'm the assistant principal and director of the career and technical education at the vocational school.

161
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:48,994
And so my

162
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:54,138
crew are the juniors and seniors who are CTE students.

163
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:55,700
Those are the ones who will report to me.

164
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,223
I'm really happy to be here to support the senior class, and I miss you guys.

165
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:02,345
So I hope you're all doing well and staying healthy.

166
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:07,349
Hi, Dave Block, assistant principal for high school students, grades 11 and 12.

167
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,712
Hi, I'm Gabby.

168
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:13,193
I'm the senior class secretary.

169
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,115
I've been secretary for the last four years.

170
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:23,198
Hi seniors, Mr. Chad Fallon, proud principal of Medford Vocational Technical High School, glad to see you tonight.

171
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,300
Dr. Cushing, you're muted.

172
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,661
Hi, my name is Dr. Cushing.

173
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:36,541
I'm the assistant superintendent for secondary.

174
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:45,303
I'm actually, despite not being able to unmute the microphone there, I am behind the scenes primarily tonight to help run and orchestrate this.

175
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:50,395
Um, really, really, really, um, excited to have this forum.

176
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:57,019
We will do more forums, uh, as, as next week rolls around for other parents, uh, in the lower grades.

177
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,040
Um, I do see a question here.

178
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:05,383
Um, and is there a timeframe for when the HVAC systems will be repaired so our seniors can return to school?

179
00:16:05,403 --> 00:16:06,444
It's a great question.

180
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:12,767
Um, in the past several weeks, there has been a significant amount of repairs that have been done to our outside schools.

181
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,573
Uh, and we are now turned, uh, all of our contractors on to the high school.

182
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,775
Uh, and that's been going on for some time.

183
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:29,499
Um, some of the repairs are easy as in, um, cleaning out coils that have been built in with a lot of.

184
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:37,223
Um, I guess look and gook, uh, for lack of a more technical technical term, um, which limits their functionality.

185
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:39,985
Um, some repairs are actually.

186
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:45,670
replacing motors and other repairs are replacing entire units.

187
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:55,298
So the situation is significant and we are working diligently to make this happen.

188
00:16:55,478 --> 00:17:06,346
As a former high school principal and someone who's dedicated the last 19 years of my life, as have the other educators here, and I'm not sure how long for all of them, but we're all about the same age, so I'm gonna say about the same time.

189
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,729
We want nothing more than to have your students back

190
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:16,953
High school, I think, even having been a middle school principal, I think high school is like the awesome part.

191
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,154
And I just, it's the culmination, it's the opportunity for so much.

192
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:32,278
And we wanna make sure that your students, your children have these experiences and make sure that they're back in school learning in person as much as possible.

193
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,639
We know our teachers want that.

194
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:36,820
We know that our parents want that.

195
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:50,254
Um, and I firmly believe that we're going to continue to build a robust opportunity for students, um, to, um, we're going to be getting kids back in as quickly as possible.

196
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:57,696
So, um, and the next question is, will the vocational students be returning to the high school before the other seniors?

197
00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:05,739
Um, we are going to be working hard to get those shops up and running so that you guys have appropriate air exchange.

198
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:10,062
and that we will be successful.

199
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:21,630
If I don't answer any of your specific questions, please feel free to email info at medford.k12.ma.us or you can email directly at pcushing at medford.

200
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:30,276
I'm also happy to speak on the phone as I've spoken to dozens of parents over the last several weeks and have those one-on-one personal conversations.

201
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:35,159
It is our priority to get kids in school and keep them in school.

202
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:43,778
So with that I'm gonna step in the background and let the students this I just have one question Gabby, what is your cat's name?

203
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:54,684
All right, awesome, so I'm just gonna on my mind so thank you and have a great day

204
00:18:56,961 --> 00:19:00,322
Mr. Fallon, I did notice some questions about shop hours.

205
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:04,044
So yeah, Zach, I see you there.

206
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:05,584
Mr. Zach Anderson, hope you're well.

207
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:06,925
Thanks for your question.

208
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:13,087
So what we're working on is like Dr. Cushing said, I have air reports actually in front of me right now that we received today.

209
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:15,528
We're working on which programs can open.

210
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,088
We're working on some offsite opportunities.

211
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:22,490
So if you guys just hang tight, I know it's been a long run, but within the next few weeks,

212
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,554
There's going to be some plans, some phased-in plans that are going to be shared with the community as soon as it's safe to do so.

213
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,254
So I hear you.

214
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:37,019
Ours, in terms of requirements for us, we're going to do everything we can to get you ready for your next step after high school.

215
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:43,783
Ours, with regard to the state and what's required for CTE students, of course, have been modified.

216
00:19:43,843 --> 00:19:48,346
And I have been in contact with the state, so I don't want anyone to worry about that in terms of your competency attainment.

217
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:49,326
We're going to get you there.

218
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:50,207
Thank you.

219
00:19:51,697 --> 00:19:54,078
I wanted to just go back a little bit.

220
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:58,079
I noticed Celia had made a comment about PTO.

221
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,581
And I just wanted to let them know that we're going to be reaching out.

222
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:02,781
We'd love to meet and talk.

223
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:07,623
And as advisors, we definitely want to touch base with them.

224
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:11,304
So we'd love to hear their ideas and whatever.

225
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,625
We know that that's a great partnership.

226
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,806
So we'll definitely be reaching out soon.

227
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,947
And I just want to build onto that because I think

228
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:24,566
like you bring up a great point that that our seniors are going to need things this year.

229
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:34,115
We would love every senior to have a t-shirt or a hoodie regardless of financial situation and we know this year that we're going to have a lot more students struggling in that area.

230
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:40,261
We want students to be able to participate as much as we can and so we're trying to do things as cheaply as possible on our end.

231
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:43,785
So for everyone be watching emails and

232
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:52,289
I'm a Bedford resident, so I'm on some of the Medford groups, like we're gonna be looking maybe if you have this weird piece of equipment that we're trying to get.

233
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:55,312
Somebody said something about snowshoeing in the fells, and I think that's lovely.

234
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:57,874
We need snowshoes for that to happen, right?

235
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:12,866
So just be paying attention because the more we can reach out to the community for your support, the better we can help each other and really give these kids kind of the best opportunity to all of them.

236
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,535
And so that is just one of the things that we're thinking out.

237
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:19,019
So we're going to be looking at those particular partnerships and reaching out.

238
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,041
So stay tuned.

239
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,364
I'm sorry.

240
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:24,786
Go ahead.

241
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:29,532
I was just going to jump to the SAT testing question.

242
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:43,072
I was just going to say the other day, the guidance team did a great job managing the first SAT in person in the building.

243
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:50,735
It was really well organized and orchestrated and lots of provisions were taken into account.

244
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,295
And so I'm hopeful that everybody

245
00:21:52,802 --> 00:21:54,704
was successful with their testing day.

246
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:59,368
But I'm sure that the guidance team will be sending out more information if we're able to do that again.

247
00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:08,197
I mean, everything does depend on how our city continues to stay safe and to stay able to offer things like that.

248
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:10,379
But the guidance team will be reaching out.

249
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:14,282
I'm going to pass it back up to Mr. Lee if he has something to add on that.

250
00:22:15,363 --> 00:22:34,930
So thank you and and and miss miss Patrick definitely explained it as best as I could as well I think the one thing that we are is we are talking about doing another date But what you people have to realize is when you're an SAT testing site You also have the opportunity of outside people coming into the building.

251
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,511
So within what we had done is

252
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,949
It was really specific to Medford High School students.

253
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:57,973
So we're trying to make sure that we get permission again from the SAT College Board that we can do that, you know, just making sure that it's Medford because that's something that, you know, there are so many emails I get from people from Malden and Somerville that signed up as

254
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:03,754
a testing site to come to Medford and, you know, the normal dates have been shut down.

255
00:23:03,814 --> 00:23:05,535
So we do want to try to do it again.

256
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:12,221
It's just going to take a little planning with the college board, but it's something that it's definitely a discussion that we're trying to do.

257
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:16,786
May I speak just quickly?

258
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,227
There's some questions about homework.

259
00:23:19,162 --> 00:23:20,904
And the quantity and the amount.

260
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:37,959
There's two things I want to say I mean one is that obviously we want to make sure that whatever we're doing this year academic wise is sustainable, and is going to, you know, is going to be something that holds for for months and months because you know it's a long year we're only about 20% through it, you know, it's a long year.

261
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:43,308
And of course, we don't want kids to be so overwhelmed that they're falling apart, that that's never anybody's intention.

262
00:23:43,628 --> 00:23:45,889
I've heard from a few parents about this sort of concern.

263
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,672
I do wanna emphasize, I don't think tonight is the night to really come to the conclusion on those.

264
00:23:51,392 --> 00:24:01,257
I think that collecting a body of concerns and taking those to the curriculum directors and some lead teachers in those departments and having some good conversations about what's expected at their level.

265
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,638
I don't think we can answer those capably tonight.

266
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:06,520
Although I do appreciate knowing and I've heard,

267
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:07,776
Parents know it.

268
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:17,440
I've heard from a good number of parents around those concerns around screen time and the number of hours in front of a screen and assignments and that sort of thing.

269
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,463
But I need to also respect where teachers are coming from and where their curriculum directors are guiding them and directing them.

270
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:29,325
So I would say those are ones to table and potentially bring forward in either a different forum or a different setting.

271
00:24:29,949 --> 00:24:39,977
Um, so, you know, I just want to put that out there to the community that you acknowledge those questions, but, uh, you know, let's, um, I'd like to focus tonight a little more on activities and ways to support your senior experience, if that makes sense.

272
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:42,019
And if anyone would like to add to that, you know, please feel free.

273
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,161
Yeah, I just, I'm going to follow up there.

274
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:50,726
Um, and as Mr. Block said, I've received the same amount of probably your phone calls and discussions as well.

275
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:52,967
And I do have a meeting with the directors.

276
00:24:53,688 --> 00:24:57,211
I know there's pacing guides, you know, there's things that, that.

277
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:02,207
some certain courses require more moving at an accelerated pace.

278
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:04,868
And unfortunately that's causing.

279
00:25:04,908 --> 00:25:07,029
The other part to remember is everybody's remote.

280
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:26,955
So it's not easy for us to communicate with one another when we're in the building and you have a group of students and you know that you have the same student as the other student as an educator and you're not realizing how much is being given from one class to another class to another class to another class.

281
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:32,318
So it's something that we are bringing up with the curriculum directors and the pacing guides.

282
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:40,906
But as I think Mr. Block said, it's going to take a little bit of time and we can't give a definite answer tonight, but it is on our radar.

283
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:50,014
So I think the one thing I want to make sure that we put out there is that we are talking about it as a building admin team and as a curriculum admin team.

284
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:55,921
So I want to just jump in here for a question that Zach and Michael were asking.

285
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:58,203
That's what we call fake news.

286
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,985
There was no matter found in the air.

287
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:08,530
So I just wanted to address that because I don't want that type of question to go unanswered and people to think that we're trying to dodge it.

288
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,633
The reality is, is that the air in the schools is totally fine.

289
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,401
There's just not movement of it in some places.

290
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:23,822
And you'll get problems when you bring students and adults back in if there's not movement of air.

291
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:28,863
And then just on a normal level, carbon dioxide will build up, those types of things.

292
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:30,723
And then we're in the middle of a pandemic.

293
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:39,044
So we want to have at least a minimum of a four in all learning spaces and make sure that we can do that.

294
00:26:39,124 --> 00:26:41,725
And for Zach and Michael, the folder with all the

295
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:48,393
All of the reports have been posted to the Medford Public Schools Facebook page.

296
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:51,515
So you can go with that.

297
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:54,316
You can find them there and happy to do it.

298
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:59,598
I'm going to put up a question now about Adopt a Senior and banners with senior photos on them.

299
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:01,479
I know we discussed that last year.

300
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:02,839
So you guys can take it away.

301
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,340
So I'll jump on that.

302
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,681
Adopt a Senior was outstanding last year.

303
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:11,103
Much credit to the organizers of that and Celia who posed that was one organizer.

304
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:13,857
Outstanding, that to me is a definite.

305
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:21,179
The idea of setting up a Class of 2021 Facebook page is a definite in my view.

306
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:31,923
Setting up senior banners, other ways to put recognition out to students, all things that I think are doable, they're outstanding, they're obviously safe in terms of COVID.

307
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:39,365
It looks like from Kelly's comment here that there are so many people who are looking to support us in some way or another.

308
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:43,411
And that's just, earnestly, that's just so appreciated.

309
00:27:43,952 --> 00:27:49,776
These were things I thought went perfect last year, when it was a lot harder to do anything.

310
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:52,938
We're talking April, May, you know, in the spring.

311
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:56,561
So I'd say there's some that are just definites in my mind.

312
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,362
I appreciate, you know, the reminders about them.

313
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:05,307
And Mrs. Catallo has reached out to me too, and indirectly, we might need,

314
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:14,541
the inflatable drive-in movie screen right now, because I think that's something that we definitely could utilize.

315
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:18,905
I know the PTO when I was at the Andrews had worked on something like that as well.

316
00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:30,815
So I'll just put that out there right now that I'm looking for the big screen, inflatable big screen that we could all watch a movie outside either on the field or in the parking lot.

317
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,036
Great.

318
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:39,377
And the senior barbecue is one of the like traditional senior events for the end of the year.

319
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:48,325
So that's definitely something just like, you know, as we know about prom, you know, may look different, but it's definitely something that's on our radar.

320
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:53,869
So we certainly are thinking about and have already, you know, had conversations about that for sure.

321
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,371
So thank you.

322
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:58,183
Perhaps the advisors would like to speak.

323
00:28:58,523 --> 00:29:03,386
I'm sorry, the officers who are on board with us tonight, if you've got any viewpoints around things you'd like to see.

324
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:06,588
I know we mentioned the sunrise and the sunset activity.

325
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:08,729
Excellent.

326
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:10,970
First, I've heard of that idea, but I'm in love with it already.

327
00:29:11,391 --> 00:29:17,394
So if you have some viewpoints or priorities, Lacey or Gabby, you'd like to share or help answer some questions.

328
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:25,423
Going back to the senior t-shirts and the senior sweatshirts, we actually do have our design contest up.

329
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:27,824
I wanted to bring that up just to get more entries.

330
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:32,007
It closes, I believe it's November 2nd, correct me if I'm wrong.

331
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:41,893
So I think that's a really good way to get involved and just giving the seniors back, just something back, I guess.

332
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:43,474
Great, wonderful.

333
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:47,921
Yeah, we also have some other events that we're trying to plan throughout the year.

334
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:57,349
Right now we're collaborating with the CCSR and the NHS to try and do something like the coffeehouse outside at the end of the year, depending on what the regulations look like.

335
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,892
We thought that might be just a fun way to get all the clubs together.

336
00:30:02,513 --> 00:30:10,302
have that nice event that so many theater kids, especially drama kids, music kids, are missing out on any opportunity to perform.

337
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:15,869
We're also talking about what prom might look like, like getting food trucks or

338
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:26,234
getting a photographer because just show up and take pictures and get a nice professional photo that you can post online, which is honestly what a lot of people want out of prom in the first place.

339
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:38,019
We've also talked about holding different events in the field, like a silent dance was one that we were thinking about with headphones and spaced out with chalk and whatnot.

340
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,840
So yeah, we definitely would like support.

341
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:44,042
We've been reaching out to the community on the Facebook and whatnot.

342
00:30:44,402 --> 00:30:46,523
Anything people want to offer is something that we'd accept.

343
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:59,181
Can I ask the officers to give us a little bit of a student perspective during school or remote schooling, just to hear your thoughts about it.

344
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:06,765
I know that's kind of putting you on the spot, but I think it's important for everybody to hear, you know, it's not just about the teachers.

345
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:08,066
It's not just about ourselves.

346
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:11,608
It's about you guys too, and how you feel, um,

347
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:14,887
public school is working, or maybe not working.

348
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:17,467
I'm hoping working better, but not working.

349
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:21,408
So just to get your perspective, because I know you guys represent students as well.

350
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:24,089
So just like to hear some thoughts.

351
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:30,530
Yeah, online schooling is honestly very difficult.

352
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,791
Personally, I'm really grateful that I can learn virtually.

353
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:41,967
I'm a pretty hands on learner.

354
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:49,373
I thrive in science classes, so like lacking labs and physical stuff has been really hard for me.

355
00:31:49,393 --> 00:31:51,695
I've been getting really tired at the end of the day.

356
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:58,850
But it's really the safest option that we have right now.

357
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,311
And I think a lot of us are trying to understand that, and that's what keeps us motivated.

358
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,512
But I think teachers have done a really good job.

359
00:32:05,572 --> 00:32:07,273
They're staying on top of things.

360
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:08,333
We're reaching out.

361
00:32:08,353 --> 00:32:12,094
The guidance team has also done a really great job of reaching out.

362
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:22,317
I know personally, with my college applications and stuff, and each teacher just is kind of catering to their students, which is really appreciated on our behalf.

363
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:29,714
Um, yeah, I mean I'm not gonna lie and say it's been easy, because it's not been it's not been easy on anyone.

364
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:41,658
But, you know, like, personally I'm a person who's very involved in all my extracurriculars, and it's been kind of awful to not be able to do any of them I mean we don't have been we don't have deer we don't have drama we don't have.

365
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:50,942
A lot of the things that we would normally be doing around this time, and it's saddening, but it's also, you know, we got to do what the senior class has always done best, which is adapt.

366
00:32:50,962 --> 00:32:52,243
We're a class of many firsts.

367
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:57,966
You know, our freshman year, we're the class that started marching for our lives, which is crazy because that seems like eons ago.

368
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,488
And, you know, we have to do what Medford High does best, just adapt and learn and get better.

369
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,041
Wait, I'm sorry.

370
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:12,527
There's a question about the Mustang mall, Mr. Fowler.

371
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:16,816
And I don't know if you want to tackle that one or that's all right.

372
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:17,598
I don't see it.

373
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:18,119
I'm sorry.

374
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,181
I'm watching here too.

375
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:21,636
So what about the Mustang Mall?

376
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:22,256
Is that open?

377
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:24,137
Is there a way those items can be sold to our students?

378
00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:32,460
So actually, the programming and web development students and the business marketing students are working on an e-commerce site for the Mustang Mall.

379
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,741
I don't know that it's going to, I mean, it's in the works now.

380
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:40,643
So I would say I'll be posting some information about that soon so that you can order things online.

381
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:42,943
But we are going to make things available for sure.

382
00:33:43,263 --> 00:33:44,504
So stand by for that.

383
00:33:48,934 --> 00:33:58,544
I'll answer, go into Stephan Langstroth's question about if we're going to remain online for the foreseeable future is the reason why the school day can't start a little later.

384
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:03,690
You know, that makes sense.

385
00:34:04,685 --> 00:34:12,887
but there are so many constituents that are involved in that kind of determination, not just students, but teachers.

386
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:18,228
And there was a lot that kind of went together to make the schedule.

387
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:24,089
And it wasn't just Mr. DeLava says that we are starting school at 745 and that's it.

388
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:29,430
There was a lot of discussion that happened within teachers with the intent of us coming back.

389
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,170
And I think that's where the focus

390
00:34:31,874 --> 00:34:36,695
had been because the two schedules have to be aligned when we do come back.

391
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:46,457
But, Stephan, what I will say is that I think we could reevaluate depending on what we know the timeframe is.

392
00:34:47,297 --> 00:34:49,618
But it needs to be like everybody at the table.

393
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:53,559
I'm talking teachers, administrators, students, and we're all on the same page.

394
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:00,340
And then the other part I wanted to bring up, and Gabby, you brought this up as well, it's kind of,

395
00:35:01,172 --> 00:35:08,016
where I'm sad is, and Lacey, you know this too, I love watching the performances, fall, spring.

396
00:35:09,617 --> 00:35:17,841
And, you know, I think that's something that, you know, we need to try to find alternatively, because that's a club that's currently not running, right?

397
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:26,166
If you think about it, because we don't have the fall festival, we just need to kind of figure out how to get that going as well.

398
00:35:26,306 --> 00:35:28,887
And maybe it's some kind of virtue.

399
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:30,568
I mean, I know it's weird, but like,

400
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:34,995
We have some capabilities to do tapings and things like that.

401
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:43,038
You know, something that maybe we do it and it's more of a TV show than it is a TV special, right?

402
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:47,120
You know, like when they do the Sound of Music Live or something like that.

403
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:59,866
So something to think about for the future as well, because I do feel, one thing I feel is that you want to try to answer to everybody's strengths or things that they enjoy and things that they love.

404
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:04,997
just because I got some clubs running right now doesn't mean I don't want to have the other clubs running too.

405
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:07,978
So something to think about down the line.

406
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:22,243
I want to just jump in and respond to Marina's question about the powder puff game and it just sort of the types of activities in general that, you know, if we're going to plan for in-person activities, you know, I think the reality that we all know is that there are, there are safe activities and there are activities that are risky.

407
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:25,825
And, you know, of course our priority will always be to keep our kids safe.

408
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:29,746
And, you know, if we're looking at something that can happen in person,

409
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:39,643
where distancing can be ensured, where people can gather in a way that we know really without a great amount of doubt is going to be okay.

410
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,004
I'm wary of the sporting, anything involving sporting.

411
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:52,108
And again, this is something that so many of us miss in so many ways because we've had to modify it or just simply give it up in terms of athletics.

412
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:59,371
But if I look at something like a hike in the fells where there's distancing ensured, okay, that seems more like a doable.

413
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:01,305
you know, there's other things that are going to be tougher.

414
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:15,011
Um, so, you know, I, I really, what I really appreciate and admire is that the way that so many parents and kids have creatively come up with ideas that can somehow still be safe, but you can still be together in person and have fun.

415
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:21,634
And I think that's just a broad theme that everybody needs to keep thinking on and sort of riffing on when they, uh, when they bring forward these ideas.

416
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:28,497
And one last thing I'll put forward just for this group here is that, you know, one area of improvement that, you know, I think that we need to make sure happens in our school,

417
00:37:29,031 --> 00:37:31,912
is a type of communication that is consistent and informative.

418
00:37:32,312 --> 00:37:47,956
And I know things have been happening, but if we can sort of systematize that communication so that you're well-informed, either through a Facebook page or post from the senior class, class 2021, students are informed through the Google Classroom, and that there's just sort of a multi-pronged way to get the word out.

419
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:56,038
So I just say in broad themes, keep the ideas coming, and we'll keep the communication methods as consistent and as robust as we can.

420
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,751
I can speak to college too.

421
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:05,714
So seniors are actually afforded three excused absences per the student handbook.

422
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:08,676
You have three excused absences to visit colleges.

423
00:38:09,697 --> 00:38:15,661
We have found over the years that it's best to let parents and families and students decide when they would be able to do that.

424
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:24,367
And if you have a college visit or other sort of career pursuit visit, if you want to please bring that information forward to me or Ms.

425
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:27,770
Fitzpatrick, if you're a CTE student, and just let us know that you need a day

426
00:38:28,211 --> 00:38:31,052
so that you can, you need a Dix U so that you can make a visit.

427
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:33,093
You know, you have a three per the student handbook.

428
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:38,494
If you find you need more, please, you know, don't hesitate to reach out to us for a discussion about, you know, how that might look.

429
00:38:38,554 --> 00:38:39,435
But just to answer Ms.

430
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:42,236
Graves question, yes, we can definitely accommodate that.

431
00:38:44,717 --> 00:38:50,398
And just to kind of follow up on that too, with the attendance part of it, you know, attendance is kind of unique this year.

432
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:54,700
If you think about it, we do a lot of figuring out

433
00:38:55,481 --> 00:39:00,564
which students are present by the end of the day, where before everything was done at the beginning of the day.

434
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:11,009
So we have to see like which students basically attend classes or how many classes that they attend remotely to determine whether they're here for the full day.

435
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:18,433
And the point I'm making here is when we know that you're going to take a day to go to college, we can inform

436
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:26,983
teachers so that they're aware that that student's not going to be present during this school day.

437
00:39:27,543 --> 00:39:35,546
So letting your assistant principal know allows us to also give the information remotely to our teachers so they're aware.

438
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,607
So they're not just saying, oh, this one's missing class today.

439
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,847
They're aware that they're going to college.

440
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:46,529
The only thing that maybe we used to ask for, and I want to make sure that we still do, is just some kind of

441
00:39:47,463 --> 00:40:12,599
verification but it's hard right virtually like if you're going to a virtual open house you might not be able to get that documentation so um you know in the past we've asked for like just a quick letter from the college that hey susie or johnny we're here for the day doing a college visit and that allowed us to uh excuse the absence at that time miss grace was was i think referencing the c3 day

442
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:15,130
that we had for the past few years.

443
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:19,373
And, you know, that was something that worked well in that we had juniors and many sophomores taking the PSAT.

444
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,394
So what I want to offer out to, you know, Ms.

445
00:40:21,414 --> 00:40:28,519
Graves, anyone else interested, is that possibly we look into that in January when we host a PSAT, you know, as that being a possible release day.

446
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:36,544
I think that's going to need a little bit of planning, but that had traditionally been in October during the traditional sort of pre-pandemic October PSAT.

447
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:42,108
But I think, I believe that day is in January, and I can follow up on that, and you'll see whether we can dedicate a day.

448
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:44,236
Thank you.

449
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,820
I just want to sort of answer the lunch question.

450
00:40:50,521 --> 00:41:01,649
What I would ask is that if you look in the old bell schedule, the lunch period, the issue is there used to be two lunches, right?

451
00:41:01,689 --> 00:41:04,291
So we had a first lunch and a second lunch.

452
00:41:04,771 --> 00:41:09,595
I will tell you that our lunch is pretty much aligned with first lunch.

453
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,096
It's not too far off.

454
00:41:11,926 --> 00:41:14,087
than what we normally had for first lunch.

455
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:20,289
The difference this year is if students do come into the building, you're going to have everybody taking one lunch.

456
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:24,791
We're not going to have two lunches because we don't want to have two big groups congregating.

457
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:29,833
So having the different cohorts basically allows us to have one lunch.

458
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:36,716
And again, with the remote schedule and the hybrid schedule, those two things have to be aligned.

459
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:41,458
So everybody's going to have to have lunch at the same time, including the teachers themselves.

460
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,302
So we want to make sure that we're staying aligned.

461
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:49,826
So we were not too far off of what first lunch normally was.

462
00:41:51,167 --> 00:42:00,116
As a teacher who has historically taken first lunch the last four years, lunch this year is actually 14 minutes later for me than it normally is.

463
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:03,619
So I'm like living the lunch dream here.

464
00:42:06,522 --> 00:42:07,923
But it is early in the morning.

465
00:42:10,134 --> 00:42:11,755
I want to speak to the yearbook question.

466
00:42:11,775 --> 00:42:14,998
Uh, there was from an email about how senior pixels would be organized and put in the yearbook.

467
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:25,686
Um, I think that is a question to refer out to Mr. Ambrose and his yearbook staff, you know, see if there is any way to gather some, uh, let's say some pictures that students had taken or some things that, uh, you know, came out, you know, on the field.

468
00:42:25,986 --> 00:42:36,254
You know, I mean, of course, uh, there, if there wasn't a group picture taken during the sporting time, my first thought is there, is there another way to bring that together as another way to get the faces, get the pictures in.

469
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:48,657
You know, what I do know is that the yearbook staff is up and running and working very hard, you know, and like with anything, they're trying to collect as much as they can in as traditional a fashion as they can.

470
00:42:49,378 --> 00:42:56,701
You know, I mean, but there's going to, you know, there's naturally going to be some things that, you know, get away from certain groups, especially if the particular thing ended.

471
00:42:57,061 --> 00:42:59,922
But I hold out hope, you know, their publishing deadlines aren't until the spring.

472
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:04,024
So, you know, if I can refer those questions out to him just to, you know, broadly speaking,

473
00:43:04,446 --> 00:43:11,290
we make sure we get everybody in there and everything that happened in there, you know, as we always do, and, you know, make it a knockout yearbook like it always is.

474
00:43:13,812 --> 00:43:25,659
Also, just to follow up on the yearbook, if there are any of my CTE seniors who are interested in helping with the CTE pages in particular, I'd be really happy to connect with you and try to

475
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,757
like work on those designs, that would be fantastic.

476
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:39,466
Also, I'd like to say that I've already been contacted by two separate Yearbook staff members to kind of get our input and ask, you know, what any, you know, events.

477
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:45,511
So it seems like they've got a really solid staff that's really aware and they're working really hard.

478
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:51,296
They've already put out announcements to the class about, you know, just any kind of quarantine pictures and things like that as well.

479
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:54,358
So Yearbook is gonna look a little different, I think, but

480
00:43:55,379 --> 00:43:57,560
but they're working really hard behind the scenes for sure.

481
00:44:01,481 --> 00:44:11,724
I had a brief conversation with Mr. Maloney yesterday about a couple of things and one of those was around looking at February as a potential return time for some sporting activity.

482
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:15,985
I don't know for sure what the dates are, what the MIA is telling us.

483
00:44:16,626 --> 00:44:21,367
That could be something that we refer out to him or if we see if Dr. Cushing has any insights on those.

484
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:28,692
Um, but of course, you know, it was, it was great to have, um, what the amount of athletic opportunities that we did have, um, was, was truly wonderful.

485
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:30,533
And I'm glad that many kids got to take part in that.

486
00:44:33,034 --> 00:44:39,497
And the other thing to add in there too, is we have opened up winter, um, registration.

487
00:44:39,517 --> 00:44:43,779
Uh, we don't like, like, um, Mr. Block had said, we.

488
00:44:45,865 --> 00:44:49,489
don't know what's going to happen, but we want to make sure the registration does happen.

489
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:59,240
Because if we do get to go ahead on certain things, we want to make sure that our athletes are registered and ready to go, even when it comes to physicals and things of that nature.

490
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:01,783
So that registration is currently open.

491
00:45:02,684 --> 00:45:07,049
If you look at the high school page, and some people saying they're not getting all the updates,

492
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:19,347
When you go to the high school page you have to go to high school news And then every post that that I tend to send out as an email also is posted there as well So that's a place where you can grant gather information

493
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:29,449
as well and you can actually subscribe it's an RSS feed so anytime I post you could set your email up to get that post as well if that's one way you want to get communication as well.

494
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:49,461
I do know that communication has been something that's been brought up as well regarding emails and try to send more robocalls along those emails as well just to to follow up but my suggestion here is as well if you know you are not receiving an email it is very very important that you contact the main office because obviously there's an issue

495
00:45:50,381 --> 00:46:13,928
Ran a report with one of my emails if I think it was the SAT email I noticed that some people are blocked and that could be a for any reason like the messenger that we send out has like unsubscribe buttons to it and that kind of causes issues and you could accidentally hit that on your phone and not be able to get another email because it's considered blocked so if you are running to any issues regarding connecting and

496
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,784
please, please, please reach out to the main office so that we are aware and we can do our best to kind of address that.

497
00:46:21,204 --> 00:46:22,965
We've also talked about sending out a form.

498
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:24,766
Ms.

499
00:46:24,786 --> 00:46:37,134
Fitzpatrick can definitely bring that up because that's something that she came up with as an idea as a building admin team of sending out a form for parents so that we can get updated information, contact information.

500
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,975
So be on the lookout for that.

501
00:46:39,055 --> 00:46:40,596
That's something that we're working on as well.

502
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,498
So I just wanted to jump in.

503
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:53,004
We have the plan is for Medford to continue with the athletics.

504
00:46:54,745 --> 00:47:02,589
We're gonna have to be in continuous consultation with Marian O'Connor, our director of health for the city of Medford.

505
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:12,055
And we wanna make sure though that we're giving our student athletes that opportunity to participate, to get that energy out, to do those types of things.

506
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:24,520
But we also, right now, the governor shut down the rinks across the state, which is really unfortunate, especially since Medford has its own hockey rink that it can access at any point.

507
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:30,165
But our plan is to continue to move forward with the workouts.

508
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:32,507
I see a parent just put that question in.

509
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:33,909
I'll pop it up on the screen.

510
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:39,013
And we really want to make sure that our student athletes are able to have these opportunities.

511
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:56,053
If Medford were to go in the red or anything along those lines, I shouldn't say were, but as we are, it's something that I think we need to be very cognizant of and make sure that we can.

512
00:47:56,073 --> 00:48:07,456
To answer Aiden McLaughlin's question as to whether or not fall sports will ever happen for the seniors, are they getting pushed back to the spring right now?

513
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:13,312
And I'm not sure how this happens having played football myself growing up and into college.

514
00:48:14,112 --> 00:48:17,315
Uh, right now fall sports is scheduled to start on February 22nd.

515
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:25,780
Uh, now having grown up in new England, a lot of times the ground is still frozen and there's this white stuff that tends to accumulate at certain points.

516
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:35,027
Um, that is difficult to run cross country, play soccer, football, um, uh, you know, other sports.

517
00:48:35,923 --> 00:48:42,885
Um, I don't know if the marching band, uh, is going to be marching through snow, but, um, we're going to try to figure it out.

518
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:49,627
And, uh, we don't have an answer for you on that, but, uh, our, our goal is to make.

519
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:56,390
You has to allow for you to have as many opportunities as possible for these traditional senior year events.

520
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:03,572
Um, so I'm going to step out again, but I did want to just answer those sports questions as I've been working with the athletic director.

521
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,781
to make sure that we can make those things happen.

522
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:16,246
And if we can't have competitive sports, then at least continue the conditioning, at least continue having students connected to adults for good positive relationships.

523
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,027
And thank you.

524
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:27,091
I just- Advisors, I do see a point of that.

525
00:49:27,151 --> 00:49:29,993
It's October 29th, and they're wondering what events we have.

526
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:32,590
coming up, so I was wondering if you could jump on that.

527
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:39,932
So I'll just point out that we have already put out two virtual events on Instagram.

528
00:49:39,952 --> 00:49:44,634
So there was the senior t-shirt contest, which Lacy mentioned.

529
00:49:44,934 --> 00:49:47,455
We also put up a pumpkin carving contest.

530
00:49:48,495 --> 00:49:57,918
The senior sunrise is currently tentatively scheduled for November 24th, or excuse me, 21st, which is after a lot of the early admission college dates

531
00:49:58,206 --> 00:50:06,509
So the students were thinking that would be a nice moment to like kind of stop and pause and come together as a lot of them have been working hard on college admissions, we know.

532
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:15,852
And then the movie night is also tentatively scheduled for November, I think it's the 25th.

533
00:50:15,932 --> 00:50:19,474
It's the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which is a half day for the students.

534
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:19,894
So, and

535
00:50:20,848 --> 00:50:24,249
it has traditionally been, and I'm assuming this year will be like a real half day.

536
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:28,330
So not like an asynchronous half day where like the school day will end at noon.

537
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,691
And then that will give us time to kind of come together and set that up.

538
00:50:31,751 --> 00:50:37,833
And students can come before going off to their holiday events with their families.

539
00:50:37,973 --> 00:50:40,374
So those are the tentative dates that we have right now.

540
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:49,877
And as the students have mentioned, brainstorming lots of other ideas, I saw a comment earlier about, can we start the traditional senior stuff earlier than May?

541
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:54,145
Trust me, I've been working with these seniors for four or this class for four years.

542
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:57,989
They will fill any moments they can find with an activity.

543
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,792
They have no problems.

544
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:05,477
And a lot of the comments you guys have been giving us are great ideas and we will throw them around.

545
00:51:05,497 --> 00:51:10,463
So there's certainly a lot of stuff to get going.

546
00:51:12,242 --> 00:51:22,608
And I think it was mentioned before the idea that we're working in collaboration or they're seeking to work in collaboration with things like the CCSR and the National Honor Society.

547
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:32,874
And so I think there's a possibility that they'll be running like events where we'll be helping out or the students will be working with other groups.

548
00:51:33,034 --> 00:51:35,235
So those things will definitely be happening.

549
00:51:36,377 --> 00:51:39,038
They are very good at coming up with ideas.

550
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:43,981
We also talked about doing small events that we did last year with fundraising.

551
00:51:44,522 --> 00:51:57,669
We don't necessarily need fundraising this year, but we thought it might be a good opportunity to support Medford small businesses to have those days where you order at a certain restaurant and you're all separate, but at least you're all eating the same food with your friends.

552
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:06,093
I wanted to address there was a discussion about guidance and senior and college applications.

553
00:52:07,774 --> 00:52:15,500
One thing that I know that we're trying to do with our guidance counselors is every Wednesday we have this a half hour advisory period.

554
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,101
So the past

555
00:52:18,157 --> 00:52:24,385
The past Wednesday, we actually had our freshmen, because our freshmen never really had their guidance overview.

556
00:52:24,966 --> 00:52:29,852
So we made sure that during that period, that advisory period, that the guidance counselors were available.

557
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:36,361
They met with all of them in one big group, and then they put them into breakout groups for the individual counselors that were with them.

558
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:40,746
That's something that we're also trying to do with the seniors as well when it comes to college applications.

559
00:52:41,247 --> 00:52:49,517
I think that takes planning though and making sure that the breakouts in but I just want to make sure that people understand that we are doing our best to make sure that.

560
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:53,320
You know, there's attention to college applications.

561
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:58,661
We do know that that's this is around the time and we know there's early decisions that are trying to be made.

562
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:07,984
We just sent out an email regarding how to upload letters of recommendation through Naviance just to remind people on how to do that process as well so

563
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:14,140
You know, again, in a remote setting, it's just, you know, trying to talk.

564
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,381
I try to do as much communication as I can with the staff.

565
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:23,862
It's a lot easier when we're face-to-face and we're having these conversations, but those things are happening.

566
00:53:23,882 --> 00:53:32,264
Lacey, you did mention, by the way, that you were, your guidance counselor had reached out to you, so I just didn't know how that experience was, if you wanted to just kind of update us.

567
00:53:34,944 --> 00:53:37,805
Uh, yeah, so, um, I'm sorry.

568
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:44,007
Um, so we had previously met with guidance before covet hit.

569
00:53:44,207 --> 00:53:49,329
I know I got to just where I lie in the alphabet with my guidance counselor with my last name.

570
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:50,450
But, um.

571
00:53:52,335 --> 00:54:02,302
There were earlier meetings regarding college and guidance counselor started reaching out to the students that said that they were interested in early action.

572
00:54:02,963 --> 00:54:09,287
So, I. I know during my elective period, I had a meeting with my guidance counselor lasted about an hour.

573
00:54:09,307 --> 00:54:14,111
We went through the checklist that we typically go through when it is an in person meeting.

574
00:54:14,631 --> 00:54:16,933
So I think that guidance is doing a pretty good job.

575
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:21,156
But if they haven't reached out, I'm sure that you can reach out to your guidance counselor.

576
00:54:21,176 --> 00:54:24,638
I've emailed my guidance counselor so many times.

577
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:26,259
Thank you, Ms.

578
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:27,000
Horne, by the way.

579
00:54:28,521 --> 00:54:31,123
But they are here for you, I'm sure.

580
00:54:31,923 --> 00:54:35,166
Just if you haven't heard, reach out if you are in need.

581
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,087
I would be happy to speak to graduation.

582
00:54:39,108 --> 00:54:40,369
We talk about a hill to die on.

583
00:54:43,171 --> 00:54:43,992
That's my hill to die.

584
00:54:44,012 --> 00:54:48,115
And we, it, I, it, it's something I just, I feel so strongly has to happen.

585
00:54:48,175 --> 00:54:50,917
And when we were very close last year, we don't need to get into it.

586
00:54:51,757 --> 00:54:53,379
Um, but we were very close last year.

587
00:54:53,399 --> 00:54:54,179
We had a great plan.

588
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:55,540
It was endorsed by the city.

589
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,162
Um, we had so many meetings.

590
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:01,945
Other communities were doing it at a time when, uh, you know, it was much more touch and go with COVID.

591
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:05,948
Um, so that's something, you know, you have my sincere pledge.

592
00:55:06,128 --> 00:55:07,990
Everybody in this space feels the same way.

593
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:08,410
I know that.

594
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:15,941
Um, and, uh, you know, we have to work out a great number of details that that's, it's a long way out, but it also is not a long way out.

595
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:19,102
Um, in that we need to start thinking and planning sooner than later.

596
00:55:19,722 --> 00:55:23,723
So, you know, I think that's something that's, that's, that's ever on our minds.

597
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:25,563
Um, we want to have a traditional experience.

598
00:55:25,963 --> 00:55:29,684
You know, I will say right now, it is not something that we want to be a virtual experience.

599
00:55:30,364 --> 00:55:36,666
Um, that's one thing where we look and say, what's the way to, you know, to manage the risk and have something that is going to be in person.

600
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:43,594
Again, it's October, we don't have a graduation plan laid out at the moment, but it is in our hearts to make that happen.

601
00:55:44,295 --> 00:55:48,538
And, you know, and again, you have my sincere pledge that that's that's a big one for me.

602
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:49,198
That's my hill.

603
00:55:50,894 --> 00:56:03,024
And I'll second what Mr. Blount said, because as we tried with class of 2020, there's a lot of effort that went into how close we were to having that experience.

604
00:56:03,704 --> 00:56:11,391
And I want to kind of reiterate exactly what he said, that this is something that we're dedicated to, that we're not saying we're giving up.

605
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:19,197
And just going right to virtual, we're going to try everything we possibly can to have a live graduation experience.

606
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:31,165
of course, that's always dependent on, you know, rules and things that go on throughout the community, and that the Board of Health approves.

607
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:36,087
We were very close last time, and we would definitely, we will try our hardest to get to where we were.

608
00:56:39,408 --> 00:56:43,110
So I want to third that, and I have to say that

609
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:48,232
It was extraordinarily sad that we weren't able to have high school graduation.

610
00:56:48,252 --> 00:56:54,697
High school graduation, as I kind of mentioned earlier with high school, high school graduation is the pinnacle.

611
00:56:55,518 --> 00:57:00,702
There are so many students, you know, who are very strong academically and it's a crowning achievement.

612
00:57:00,802 --> 00:57:11,732
And then there are some students who struggle, who, you know, the community of the high school and the community of teachers throughout their career have rallied around them to really help them, to support them.

613
00:57:12,386 --> 00:57:15,548
coaches, parents, friends, whoever.

614
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:22,052
And it's a crowning achievement for so many kids for so many different reasons.

615
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:30,977
And I really hope that we're able to honor not only the class of 2021 in person, but that we can even consider something for the class of 2020.

616
00:57:31,778 --> 00:57:41,584
My niece was a college graduate last year and their beautiful graduation at her college was just canceled and done virtually in her backyard.

617
00:57:42,717 --> 00:57:46,539
I hope not only Medford, but I hope that other institutions will consider this.

618
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:53,543
I did wanna pop in on one question that Felice Bailey asked.

619
00:57:53,883 --> 00:57:58,906
I'm actually gonna, I accidentally, a question came in and I clicked and the answer came out from her son.

620
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:01,248
So good job, Colin.

621
00:58:02,108 --> 00:58:05,790
But I wanted to answer her question.

622
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:12,194
And so her question is cohort A has had two positive cases within a week in building B, which is the safest.

623
00:58:13,034 --> 00:58:14,856
What building were the SATs taken in?

624
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:20,482
So there are a lot of factors that go into how someone gets this virus.

625
00:58:21,363 --> 00:58:27,710
And, you know, we are doing diligent work to keep students separated in the building, to maintain six feet of space.

626
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:35,238
When seniors come in, it is going to be extraordinarily important that you maintain physical distancing.

627
00:58:36,152 --> 00:58:40,556
that you keep your masks on, that you frequently wash your hands or sanitize.

628
00:58:41,336 --> 00:58:46,701
I think you'll be amazed at the amount of sanitizers that are up in the building, pretty much everywhere.

629
00:58:47,181 --> 00:58:51,305
You can't look into a space or down a hallway without seeing a sanitizer.

630
00:58:51,925 --> 00:59:00,753
I would say that what we really need to do is make sure that that work is done by our students and our staff.

631
00:59:01,725 --> 00:59:11,229
So one thing that we can't control, and this recently happened in Marblehead and many other communities across the state, we can't control the behaviors of students outside of school.

632
00:59:12,029 --> 00:59:19,972
And we can't make students stay away from one another, we can't make students not gather.

633
00:59:20,652 --> 00:59:30,256
And we need to make sure that as much as possible, you're following Dr. Fauci's rules, that it's the mask, sanitizing, and physical distancing.

634
00:59:30,991 --> 00:59:35,875
Um, so, you know, we do have good air movement in building B at this point.

635
00:59:36,696 --> 00:59:39,558
Um, so it's, it's just one of those things.

636
00:59:39,678 --> 00:59:42,741
The, the SATs were taken on the first floor of C building.

637
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:48,205
Um, I, myself with Mrs. Schulman, we went down and we measured six feet of space from all the desks.

638
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:58,533
Uh, then we also moved in, uh, our HEPA filters to the spaces so that there were HEPA filters in every room, um, moving the air.

639
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,395
Uh, so I just wanted to step in and.

640
01:00:00,885 --> 01:00:06,188
give an answer to that question and then hand it back to the group.

641
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,431
So I know it's about 845.

642
01:00:10,531 --> 01:00:13,293
So I think I'm going to answer this last question.

643
01:00:13,353 --> 01:00:22,459
And then, um, I know that we'll probably plan on having more forums like this, um, you know, in the coming weeks as we get closer to certain things and certain events.

644
01:00:23,314 --> 01:00:29,055
But one thing that was brought up was April break by Stephen Langsher.

645
01:00:29,075 --> 01:00:33,776
I think what happened last year with April break, again, everything was so new.

646
01:00:33,856 --> 01:00:35,457
We didn't know what was going to happen.

647
01:00:36,037 --> 01:00:43,779
So there was things that needed to be adjusted because the school year, I mean, we all were kind of everyone knows March 13th, right?

648
01:00:43,879 --> 01:00:44,519
That's the date.

649
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:49,740
So we weren't aware if we were coming back or coming back and who had done what for work.

650
01:00:50,399 --> 01:00:56,502
This year, the district calendar is posted on the homepage and all the breaks that are listed are listed.

651
01:00:56,542 --> 01:01:06,486
So for example, you know, this next Tuesday, which is election day, that is a day off from school for teachers and students.

652
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,848
So that's in the calendar and good to go.

653
01:01:09,928 --> 01:01:12,109
Veterans Day next week, that's a day off.

654
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:13,820
the following week.

655
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,301
I'm sorry after November.

656
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:16,702
That's a day off.

657
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:18,283
That's in the calendar.

658
01:01:18,503 --> 01:01:23,527
So we are honoring the breaks that are currently in the calendar.

659
01:01:24,428 --> 01:01:36,137
So I personally want to thank first our advisors, our students, the vocational school, Dr. Cushing for taking the time to be part of this forum.

660
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:46,028
Um, as was mentioned as well is we will try to, you know, whatever questions we didn't get to, we'll review and we'll try to kind of do an FAQ kind of thing.

661
01:01:46,048 --> 01:01:49,991
Um, but I wanted to say, I appreciate everybody being part of this.

662
01:01:50,212 --> 01:01:56,957
And again, this is a great environment where we can address things as best we can and, um, virtually.

663
01:01:57,217 --> 01:02:01,120
And, um, I look forward to hearing more and doing more of these kinds of, uh, forums.

664
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,341
So thank you everyone.

665
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:06,230
Thank you everyone.

666
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:07,752
I want to give a quick shout out to everyone.

667
01:02:07,832 --> 01:02:08,633
Thank you so much.

668
01:02:08,713 --> 01:02:11,336
The students on here were phenomenal as were the class advisors.

669
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:17,304
and we will be putting together that FAQ for early to middle of next week.

670
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:25,029
Feel free to continue to send your questions to info at medford.k12.ma.us.

671
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:38,499
I have been forwarding them to all of the adults on the call, and I have no problem forwarding to the young adults as well so that everyone can see them, but they will be there for you to see and to have answered.

672
01:02:39,397 --> 01:02:40,637
We're going to end the broadcast now.

673
01:02:41,757 --> 01:02:45,658
And I really look forward to a day soon when I can say it's a great day to be a Mustang.

674
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:53,940
I haven't said it because let's be honest, it's a really challenging day to be a teacher, a student and all of that.

675
01:02:53,960 --> 01:03:02,222
And, you know, hopefully we can start getting positive and start really getting our kids back in the building.

676
01:03:02,462 --> 01:03:03,242
So thank you very much.
