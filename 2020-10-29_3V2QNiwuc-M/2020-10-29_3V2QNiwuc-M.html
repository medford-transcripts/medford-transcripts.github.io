    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=2.225s">Hello,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=5.049s">Hello</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=7.872s">Hopefully</a>  you are joining us live. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=10.916s">As</a>  discussed at the school committee meeting and other communications, tonight is a night to have a forum with our class of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=21.314s">to</a>  discuss events, to discuss some concerns, to discuss things that are working. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=27.92s">As</a>  you can see here, there are multiple administrators here as well as class advisors and a class officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=35.726s">We</a>  encourage you to put comments in that we will try to answer as we go through tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=42.552s">We</a>  also have questions that were given to us previously through info at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=49.741s">that</a>  we will try to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=51.062s">If</a>  we're not jumped on it right away, please make sure you put it in the comments for us to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=57.205s">So</a>  we will wait and we will try to answer any questions that come up on comments so that we can address what you're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=66.691s">Oh,</a>  hi, Gabby. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=69.272s">Gabby's</a>  a class officer as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=76.842s">So,</a>  I don't see any comments yet, so let's try to... So, Mr. DeLeva, can we just do some quick introductions, if I can put out there to the audience there, that we have Lacey Intapa, who is the Senior Class Vice President, Class 2021, and Gabby Yamamoto, who is the Senior Class Secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=93.696s">Also,</a>  the co-advisors, the extraordinarily hardworking Riley Jones and Cheryl Giordano. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=98.34s">And</a>  of course, you know me, you know Mr. Fallon, Mr. DeLeva, <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=103.226s">Of</a>  course, Dr. Cushing, our assistant superintendent and our assistant director principal vocational school, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=107.19s">Fitzpatrick.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=108.251s">So</a>  just a quick shout out and recognition to our hardworking team, in particular the students who have really been stepping up so far.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=116.459s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=118.1s">So</a>  probably a good thing, because again, I don't see comments, but a lot of things have been about events. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=122.484s">So</a>  maybe we talk a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=124.52s">start</a>  off with events and then if there's anything regarding other aspects of the high school or the vocational school we can definitely try that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=132.122s">So</a>  does somebody want to take it away and just do a little bit of an overview of things that we were talking about regarding events?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=140.725s">I'm</a>  happy to get that started.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=142.806s">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=143.926s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=144.847s">I</a>  know some of you will know me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=145.947s">I'm</a>  Cheryl Giordano. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=146.988s">I'm</a>  a teacher at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=149.269s">I've</a>  been with the class since our freshman year and we are really blessed with a group of students who are creative and out of the box thinkers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=158.312s">So</a>  I think that while this year will be very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=161.393s">I</a>  think we don't <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=162.964s">We</a>  couldn't ask for anything more from a group of kids to be able to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=166.745s">So</a>  we're very pleased with some of the ideas that they've come up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=170.046s">I</a>  just want to give you an overview that we're thinking already about some events for the fall, things that are outdoors, socially distanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=178.088s">We</a>  might need to limit numbers a little bit to be in compliance with the Medford public health guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=183.289s">So</a>  we want to try and offer multiple smaller events <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=187.278s">so</a>  that students might not be able to go to everything, but they can go to something. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=190.9s">That</a>  is kind of our goal there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=194.603s">I</a>  know there have been lots of questions and comments about prom or some sort of senior dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=200.506s">And</a>  I do want to let you know that we are thinking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=204.008s">We've</a>  been talking about it with Mr. Black and Mr. Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=206.55s">That</a>  is definitely on our mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=208.763s">May</a>  is also a long time away, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=210.724s">So</a>  what will happen in May is what's going to happen in May, but we will do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=215.805s">Whatever</a>  we can hobble together under the circumstances we find ourselves in, we will do something to help these wonderful students mark the end of what has been a very long journey for them in terms of getting a public education. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=230.386s">So</a>  I wanted to throw it now to our two students who are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=235.23s">They've</a>  come up as part of the team with some wonderful ideas for the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=239.334s">So</a>  Lacey or Gabby, would one of you like to talk about a couple of the ideas for this fall?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=247.512s">Um,</a>  yeah, I can talk about a couple of ideas we've gone through. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=250.934s">So,</a>  something that was requested a lot was a senior sunrise. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=255.816s">Which</a>  we are really excited about hopefully starting a new tradition at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=260.479s">And</a>  so basically, we're all going to get together 1 morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=264.681s">In</a>  November, a Saturday morning, and we are going to watch the sunrise together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=268.423s">Um,</a>  just as a nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=271.482s">beginning</a>  of the year event that we can all do together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=274.003s">And</a>  we have also started planning a drive-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=277.524s">So</a>  we are hoping to show a movie at the high school and have people in the parking lot just to have together.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=287.779s">Yeah,</a>  to add on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=289.12s">With</a>  the senior sunrise, we're hoping to also have another event at the end of the year, which would be a senior sunset to kind of celebrate the seniors in their senior year, you know, rising and then leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=299.509s">Also</a>  with the drive-in, we have a tentative date for the day, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, that's going to be probably held within the high school parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=309.018s">And</a>  we're also, it's going to be a free event, but we're going to also be selling concessions.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=315.709s">So</a>  I'll jump in there because there's a question about NHS induction. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=320.252s">Our</a>  goal is to follow the guidelines and have this event occur, again, as long as we're just in compliance with what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=330.439s">The</a>  tough part will be, excuse me, is determining the venue, depending on what the current theater has the ability to do, or we put it in a different area within the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=345.953s">but</a>  we are looking to host events, certain events that we know we can be in compliance for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=360.059s">I</a>  think you're muted there, Mr. Gluck.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=364.321s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=364.841s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Leib. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=365.661s">So</a>  good evening parents and everyone else watching, students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=369.363s">We</a>  appreciate your presence here and thank you for bringing this forward as something that you were looking forward to. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=375.589s">having</a>  with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=376.729s">I</a>  think I just sort of want to speak in broad terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=379.73s">I</a>  feel like I want to give a lot of credit to every single person who is doing something to make the school year work in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=387.031s">And</a>  that is everybody in some part and to some extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=391.632s">Figuring</a>  out how to make this work with the new set of circumstances, obviously much credit to anyone involved with advancing senior activities, whether it's at school level or whether there's caring parents who coalesce together to try to find some way to make this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=405.026s">You</a>  know, so I think that, you know, one thing to just put out to the group is that a lot of work has happened, will continue happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=414.491s">And</a>  I hope tonight we can just shape some of the direction that people really would like to see happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=420.735s">If</a>  I can just jump in on some of the questions so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=424.256s">So,</a>  you know, a student question from Aiden just regarding senior events in the winter, considering it will be cold outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=430.08s">You</a>  know, I think to myself, there's some friends of ours who are from, <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=434.946s">you</a>  know, Calgary, who, uh, you know, laugh at us when we talk about indoor dining closing, cause it's too cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=439.169s">You</a>  know, I think we need to, we need to be creative and resilient and maybe there's some way to do some fun events outside, even if it is a little bit chilly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=445.552s">You</a>  know, we luck out and get a balmy night, but, you know, we think to ourselves, what can work, what can be safe and, uh, plan it, plan a makeup night. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=451.876s">If</a>  it's a little tough, um, you know, the weather's truly bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=455.038s">Um,</a>  but you know, just like Lacey was saying, looking forward and Gabby was saying, looking forward to things where we can do a socially distant. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=461.92s">because</a>  that's truly, you know, I think right now what we have to work with, you know, we can't expect otherwise.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=467.463s">I</a>  think we could also think about things, and I know it's tough, but I mean, rentals of certain tents, space heaters, I mean, those are ideas that are outside of the box that, you know, need to be a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=482.249s">I</a>  mean, in my thought process, you know, we could definitely decorate the parking lot better than <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=488.675s">know,</a>  the way it's looked in the past for just parking cars or things up on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=494.197s">I</a>  think this is a time for us to be creative as best that we can and think a little bit outside than our norm.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=505.401s">I'll</a>  just also throw in that this gives us the opportunity to also take advantage of the cold, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=511.463s">Like</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=512.489s">First</a>  blizzard comes there's no reason why we can't have small pockets of seniors meeting at local parks around the city to have no man building contest right but then like feeds into a virtual piece so like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=524.488s">I</a>  think that yes, cold outside is an element we have to consider, but I don't think it has to mean that we can do nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=531.335s">It</a>  just means that we have to get, like people are saying, more creative and use that cold to help spur on ideas.</p>

    <p>[Riley Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=537.482s">And</a>  just to add to that, I think also with the students, much credit to them, they've been creative and coming up with new ideas and new things to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=547.232s">you</a>  know, ideas of putting events in different areas of Bedford so that each kind of group of students feels like something happens in their own part of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=556.159s">And</a>  so we're definitely gonna keep trying to be as creative, like Cheryl said, as possible and opening it up to, you know, community and student, you know, ideas and requests as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=569.93s">Can</a>  I- I think- Oh, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=571.171s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=573.168s">This</a>  year has also proven that we can do things virtually, and there's nothing wrong with doing things virtually. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=578.59s">People</a>  should always keep their eye on the senior class Instagram. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=581.111s">We're</a>  always running events. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=582.232s">We're</a>  always trying to get people together without getting together.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=587.034s">Can</a>  I speak to the senior 60 hour requirement? <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=590.235s">I</a>  would like to follow up on that question with Stacey Shulman, our director of guidance and clinical services, just to make sure we know what's going on with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=597.058s">I</a>  think there has to be some flexibility there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=599.059s">There's</a>  really no doubt about that, especially if kids were <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=602.389s">interfered</a>  with the pandemic and we're looking to do some service, that is something where I think there's just going to require some amount of flexibility and accommodation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=610.135s">So</a>  I'll plan to update the senior community when I know more there.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=613.737s">Right,</a>  and to follow up too, it's something that we just don't wanna waive right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=619.902s">I</a>  think, as Mr. Blau said, it's more of flexibility and accommodation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=625.165s">And</a>  again, another thing of thinking outside of the box, <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=629.397s">where</a>  I just don't wanna just right away take it away. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=632.619s">It</a>  is within our graduation requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=636.501s">I</a>  think last year, we knew that some students were never gonna be able because we just were never sure what was gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=644.867s">So</a>  we had to kind of think about waiving that requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=648.029s">But</a>  this being a full year, I just wanna make sure that we're thinking and not just taking that off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=656.275s">So</a>  I think, yes, as Mr. Blauck said, following up with Mrs. Shulman, I think as an admin team, we're going to have to sit down together and kind of make a determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=666.523s">Maybe</a>  the hours are lessened. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=669.985s">Regarding</a>  that I saw someone do something with getting supplies to our school and donating, and that was more of a CCSR project, but that doesn't mean that that's limited <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=680.74s">to</a>  just the CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=682.121s">Students</a>  can do, you know, individual things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=684.643s">I</a>  mean, even if, like you're saying, you're hosting a virtual story reading for students, you know, those are younger students, you know, those are things that, you know, we get to think outside the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=697.212s">So</a>  we will definitely, you know, inform you regarding that requirement, but we definitely want to kind of not make sure we take it off the table right away.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=710.758s">Someone's</a>  asked about clubs and activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=712.619s">So</a>  our game plan for that is that Mr. Fallon and Mr. DeLeva will be coordinating a master list of clubs and activities that we will publish to the school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=721.005s">Some</a>  clubs have already launched. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=722.886s">The</a>  important thing is just to systematize that around exactly how things are launching, how do you get contact information, where are things meeting, whether they're virtual, if we're going to do in-person, what would be the safety measures and protocols there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=736.195s">So</a>  that's something again that we, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=738.72s">I</a>  don't want to make excuses, but there's a lot of things that are happening now and clubs and activities are something that we've, you know, more recently in the past two weeks or so, I've been coordinating to prepare some sort of master document. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=749.426s">That's</a>  just to help Emma with her question.</p>

    <p>[Paul D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=751.687s">And</a>  we do have some clubs that are currently running. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=755.87s">like</a>  the Asian Club is currently running, the Anime Club is currently running, the Gay-Straight Alliance is currently doing events. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=764.857s">So</a>  we do have small pockets of clubs that are going through, but I think as what Mr. Blount said, that we make sure that our master list is out there for you, so you're aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=774.885s">I</a>  know that some club members reach out to other club members, and so that's how that's known. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=779.789s">I</a>  try to post things out too from emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=782.872s">I</a>  know the students get an email from me <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=785.143s">every</a>  morning and it started off as like who's absent but now it's turned into a let me give you some information kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3V2QNiwuc-M&t=792.568s">So</a>  I always encourage students to check their morning emails just to get that information as well.</p>
