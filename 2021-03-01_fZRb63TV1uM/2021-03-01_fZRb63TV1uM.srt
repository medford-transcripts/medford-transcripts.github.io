1
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:08,576
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't fixed and now it's still saying there's a engagement and strategic planning meeting 5 to 6 30 tonight, and it doesn't list this one.

2
00:00:09,196 --> 00:00:18,401
[SPEAKER_08]: So this, this meeting is posted on the main page on the main page of the website if you scroll to the bottom it has today's meeting posted.

3
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:25,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So if it's a second, a second posting we've we've tried to get it on the front page.

4
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:28,639
[SPEAKER_08]: The upcoming meetings right now.

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:37,770
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can definitely, I didn't realize that the other calendar had incorrect information.

6
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will get it there as well.

7
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:45,579
[SPEAKER_08]: But today's meeting is posted on the main page at the bottom.

8
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:46,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

9
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:48,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make sure it's posted somewhere.

10
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

11
00:00:50,316 --> 00:01:00,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And Susie just sent the revised schedule to Rachel right now as well to see if she can make those adjustments on that other calendar.

12
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:01,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

13
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:01,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, great.

14
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:02,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

15
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:02,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

16
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:03,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

17
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:05,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

18
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Member Graham?

19
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:10,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we still a physical posting city?

20
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:11,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words,

21
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:22,057
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't the question whether Clerk Hurtubise has this physically posted in order for it to be a compliant meeting?

22
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:23,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct still?

23
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:24,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

24
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so does the clerk have this meeting posted?

25
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:28,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

26
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:29,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

27
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

28
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,849
[SPEAKER_08]: All meetings are sent to the clerk's office first.

29
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,030
[SPEAKER_08]: He gets it.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

31
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:39,092
[SPEAKER_08]: First listing, yes.

32
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:47,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then, you know, questions about not being a physical posting city, I think are important ones for the city to take up.

33
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:56,901
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, as it relates to compliance with the open meeting lie, I think as long as it's posted with the clerk, we're okay.

34
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:58,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be right.

35
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:00,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think officially we're okay.

36
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:04,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I just still have an issue with it being wrong on the school website.

37
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:05,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

38
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I just just want to make sure it nicely that we, you know,

39
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:19,752
[SPEAKER_03]: try to get all Susie and Lisa and Rachel Powery now who's involved in the calendar to make sure they're talking every day and getting the right information out.

40
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:23,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, Lisa Evangelista has her hand raised.

41
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:23,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yep.

42
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:26,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Mayor.

43
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:26,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Lisa.

44
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:37,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's confusing, I'm sorry, but it's always posted, obviously Susie sends it to Adam first, Jackie gets it, so it's put on the website.

45
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:39,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it on the website.

46
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also on the blog and it's also sent to all the PTO Facebook pages.

47
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:47,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do try to get the word out as best we can.

48
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:54,410
[SPEAKER_04]: As for the calendar, Rachel always handled it just because the physical plant

49
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,844
[SPEAKER_04]: of the buildings who are under community schools.

50
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:05,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why she was assigned the master calendar, because they needed to know who was in the buildings at what time and for how long.

51
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,734
[SPEAKER_04]: So with school committee not being in buildings right now, I think it just went by the wayside.

52
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:16,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna take the blame for that because Susie is new and she wouldn't have known that either.

53
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:21,722
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, now we all know, so we'll make sure Rachel's in the loop.

54
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:23,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, awesome.

55
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, from now on then if a meeting is changed.

56
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:31,254
[SPEAKER_04]: The website and the calendar are two different things and unfortunately I handle by two different people.

57
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:33,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so when the change comes in, Ms.

58
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:42,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Wise does the agendas, so you'll send the changes to Rachel and Lisa.

59
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:43,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

60
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:43,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

61
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:44,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect, thank you.

62
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,486
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sorry, thank you.

63
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:47,107
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's okay.

64
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,600
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're recording, we're live.

65
00:03:50,580 --> 00:04:09,330

[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have member McLaughlin to thank for coordinating all of the evaluations.

80
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:08,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, member McLaughlin.

81
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:12,084
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome, Mayor.

82
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:18,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, Member Ruseau, for creating the templates, because it would have been double the job had those not existed.

83
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,930
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm happy that they exist.

84
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

85
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:24,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll have them for next time around to guide the process.

86
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:25,933
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was really helpful.

87
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:26,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

88
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:27,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

89
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:28,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Very helpful.

90
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:32,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you want to screen share?

91
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:35,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Or does anybody have questions?

92
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:39,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like us to screen share, Mayor?

93
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:40,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do that.

94
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:43,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that might be best, and we can discuss from there.

95
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

96
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a quick question, a process question.

97
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:49,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

98
00:06:51,285 --> 00:07:03,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for not knowing this, but there is, I believe there's a state system that the review is input by Mr. Murphy or somebody that is a compliance requirement like this.

99
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:06,655
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just create this spreadsheet and then file it away.

100
00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:08,076
[SPEAKER_00]: The state gets it.

101
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:24,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, I just wanna, um, understand, you know, that submission, um, what, you know, for the numbers that will be going over, I'm pretty clear that that's exactly what they'll be expecting.

102
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:33,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but from the feedback perspective, um, I'm not really sure what the form is that, you know, if the feedback even gets put into the state system or not.

103
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:37,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I'm just curious if anybody does know that detail because

104
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:47,671
[SPEAKER_00]: I think feedback, at least for myself, was certainly a harder part of this, and where that's gonna go and how that's gonna go matters, I think.

105
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:52,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Edward-Vincent?

106
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:59,235
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a system, TeachPoint, and it will go into that portal.

107
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:11,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the hard copy of all of the documents will go into my hard file that is kept in HR.

108
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:22,061
[SPEAKER_08]: So the hard copy of all the documents that were sent to me will be collated and placed in the hard file.

109
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,382
[SPEAKER_08]: For DESE purposes of reporting, it's the rating that gets

110
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:35,866
[SPEAKER_08]: the overall rating is what ends up getting reported in the DESE portal.

111
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

112
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

113
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:51,594
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm wondering, based on what Member Ruseau was just saying a moment ago, do we need

114
00:08:53,548 --> 00:09:06,240
[SPEAKER_05]: a motion that these forms are used and moved forward in the future through DESE, or are you just saying that this is part of the process that already exists within DESE that they get these forms?

115
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:10,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we need to formally accept these forms now that they've been created?

116
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering about process as well.

117
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:15,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I think because this particular

118
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:26,109
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, last go around when I got it, it wasn't as comprehensive with the, you know, the spreadsheet and the tables.

119
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,873
[SPEAKER_08]: So this kind of gives a very detailed breakout.

120
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:42,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So this whole document can be probably attached as an artifact or attached to the spreadsheet.

121
00:09:44,553 --> 00:10:02,191
[SPEAKER_08]: the portal, but like all the documents that were submitted, I will just have all of this kept in the hard file and then uploaded to the portal so that DESE has it as a record.

122
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:08,117
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's the rating that normally is what goes into the system, the official rating.

123
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,023
[SPEAKER_05]: So can you guys see this?

124
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:30,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you seeing my screen now?

125
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:31,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.

126
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:36,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's hard to read with the feedback, so I can just collapse the files on the feedback.

127
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:50,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just looking at, if you guys want, Mayor, we're just looking at the measure and the score, or do you wanna leave open the feedback cells as well, and I can just scroll over for each member?

128
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how do you guys wanna do this?

129
00:10:53,485 --> 00:11:04,448
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go over maybe the scores first and then just briefly discuss anything that wants to be discussed as far as the comments go.

130
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:06,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

131
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:13,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys want me to collapse the cells so that it's easier to just see these or do you want to, are you fine with just leaving them open?

132
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:14,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me some direction.

133
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I mean, I think I could read them the way they are.

134
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:21,553
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to scroll down as I go standard based on curriculum,

135
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Standards-based unit design, 3.57.

136
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:25,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Lesson development support, 3.5.

137
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:28,149
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as instruction is concerned, that's a 3.53.

138
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Instructional practices, 3.76.

139
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:31,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Quality of work, 3.53.

140
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Diverse learners needs, 3.31.

141
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,110

196
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:13,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Member Van der Kloot.

197
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you're done, right?

198
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

199
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:37,985
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just have to say that this is really an outstanding review for a new superintendent, or a still newish superintendent, if you would.

200
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:49,169
[SPEAKER_07]: That not one of the numbers is lower than a three, and most of them are 3.5 or higher is just truly remarkable.

201
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:59,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, the overall picture that we see here is of a very strong performance by the superintendent.

202
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:05,741
[SPEAKER_07]: For the sake of the audience, I just want to mention that it's a numbers we were reading was a score.

203
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:09,987
[SPEAKER_07]: each of the committee members rated the superintendent.

204
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:16,331
[SPEAKER_07]: One was the lowest rating that she could receive in an area and four was the highest.

205
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:20,353
[SPEAKER_07]: And we could differentiate by doing a 3.5.

206
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:25,857
[SPEAKER_07]: But what you're seeing is that in all areas, the superintendent

207
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:37,641
[SPEAKER_07]: had a very strong showing where not only the majority of the committee, but the whole committee thought that she was doing work of three or higher.

208
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Remembering 4.0 is the very highest.

209
00:16:43,123 --> 00:16:48,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And we saw the breakdown of the sheets in some areas, people gave her fours completely.

210
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:53,167
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we did it a little bit differently.

211
00:16:54,548 --> 00:17:07,152
[SPEAKER_07]: In the future, I'd like to spend a little bit more time talking through each of the areas with my fellow committee members, just so that we're all sure that we're rating the particular item in the correct way.

212
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:11,794
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, really, congratulations, Superintendent.

213
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say this is a very, very strong showing.

214
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:22,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that when you opened it up today, we must have seen that that smile must have lit up your office for sure.

215
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, member van de Kloet.

216
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:28,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, members of the school committee.

217
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:48,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really pleased, very happy with the evaluation and the level of complexity, the spreadsheet and being able to look at the feedback and read the narratives and the descriptions that went

218
00:17:49,369 --> 00:18:14,321
[SPEAKER_08]: that were given so I know that a lot of time and work went into that process and I appreciate it incredibly and I'm you know very honored and I always say in my communications that I am the proud superintendent of Medford Public Schools and this evaluation confirms that we

219
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:21,304
[SPEAKER_08]: believe that the work that needs to be done in Medford is the work that is taking place.

220
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:26,325
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am committed to continuing to work hard.

221
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:43,490
[SPEAKER_08]: And since you as a school committee member, members as a team gave fractional improvements where there are areas that clearly I can continue to push myself and strive.

222
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,472
[SPEAKER_08]: for those fours, I'm gonna continue to do that.

223
00:18:48,072 --> 00:19:04,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I will continue to keep applying myself and looking at the areas where there was more constructive feedback, where the opinion was that I could be doing more, and I will continue to try to do that.

224
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:06,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

225
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:09,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Van der Kloot.

226
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:10,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

227
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:11,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

228
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:13,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Member Ruseau?

229
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

230
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I also wanted to say thank you Dr. Edouard-Vincent, it's been a pleasure working with you.

231
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:34,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really interesting to be able to put this data together I actually, you know, it was tedious for sure, but it was really interesting because it let me do a deep dive into the evaluations and really see sort of where the members were and be able to do some comparative

232
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:42,500
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of, you know, layperson analysis, if you will, or what have you, and the narrative was really helpful as well.

233
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I think the message is very much that, you know, we're, we're fortunate to have you.

234
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:51,302
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing a great job in a lot of areas.

235
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:54,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this evaluation certainly shows your strengths.

236
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:58,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also think it does show us where we have some work to do.

237
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:01,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm looking forward to working.

238
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:13,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that for every member here that was able to share where there was work to do, there was full confidence that you recognize that and are capable and able to be a leader in those realms.

239
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:15,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited about that, especially

240
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:18,218
[SPEAKER_05]: with a review like this again on year number three.

241
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:19,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that this is great.

242
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:34,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And just for the record, Mayor, also, I'm assuming this is, I know that the superintendent was saying that this goes in to the file, and I'm assuming, you know, these are public records, obviously, we're showing them in a public meeting, so folks can see them if they want to look further.

243
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:35,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that accurate, Mayor?

244
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:42,604
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my actually first time evaluating the superintendent.

245
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:44,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Van der Kloot, can you speak to that at all?

246
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:46,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know where the evaluations usually go?

247
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:50,146
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't know.

248
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:59,430
[SPEAKER_07]: We always did them in public or we did a, you know, spoke about our evaluations in public.

249
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they were given to the superintendent.

250
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:05,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I would assume that it's just a public,

251
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:11,855
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, paper, which is available to the public, but I don't know how we want to post it.

252
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:18,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in response to that, I do also want to say, if I could, Mayor, is it okay for me to just respond?

253
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Member McLaughlin, then Member Rizzo.

254
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:20,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

255
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:28,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in response to that too, I just want to, again, I think that this is a really great example of process and, you know, what didn't occur in the past.

256
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:33,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think both having a narrative that explains what this process is, and as Member van de Kloot was saying,

257
00:21:34,324 --> 00:22:01,927
[SPEAKER_05]: having some discussion about these you know individual items and also as the superintendent is evaluating herself knowing that this will be the form um when she does her self-evaluation that will be um the rubric that we'll be working with so that it will help inform that and the process as well I think is really critical so I think also for those who are watching the good news is is that there's a process in place there's a form that you know is existing we'll be using moving forward and um I think rules policy and

258
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:07,849
[SPEAKER_05]: the equity subcommittee is a good example of sort of really getting these policies moving and putting things into place.

259
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,949
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very happy to see this.

260
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:17,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I want to thank the committee for putting the processes in place and making them transparent.

261
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:18,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

262
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:22,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin, member Rousseau?

263
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:25,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor, could I go after member Rousseau?

264
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:28,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, member, member Kreatz, I didn't see you there.

265
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:29,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, no problem, that's fine.

266
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:30,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks.

267
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:34,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

268
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be doing this all over in 16 weeks.

269
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:44,024
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the side effects of being so late is that we will actually gain practice in a shorter amount of time than normal.

270
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:54,691
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope everybody, as I was writing my own comments and trying to do the review, it was challenging to realize that this is not for this year.

271
00:22:54,711 --> 00:23:00,915
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when people, if anybody in the public is looking at this,

272
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:09,322
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to remember that this is for the year ending June 30, 2020, 30, 31, whatever the numbers are.

273
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,963
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will be at this again in very short order.

274
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:30,506
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only other, the only additional feedback from what's in here is that, you know, the superintendent, I don't believe lived through the previous protocol for doing a review, which was absolutely horrible.

275
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:34,609
[SPEAKER_00]: pages and pages of questions for which we didn't have answers.

276
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:39,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a huge improvement that the state put through, DESE, I believe.

277
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:46,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great, but it still does have some of the shortcomings that the old system had.

278
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:56,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that we may be asked a question, I'm just looking at the current screen, you know, lesson development support.

279
00:23:56,098 --> 00:23:59,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a paragraph somewhere that tells you what that means.

280
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And

281
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:11,787
[SPEAKER_00]: as with the old system, but in much, much less severity, individual members may not actually be able to answer the question.

282
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,007
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, is that we must answer the question.

283
00:24:15,227 --> 00:24:17,268
[SPEAKER_00]: We must put a number for every item.

284
00:24:17,648 --> 00:24:18,808
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not optionals.

285
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:30,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just urge the superintendent and her team to think about each of these items and realize that the members

286
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:47,280
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciate a lot, having had work product presented in some fashion, whether it's simply a report or in some partisan presentation, that will allow us to feel like we have a clue what that thing meant when we get to the review.

287
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,964
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, this this is a dramatically better review process than the old one.

288
00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:58,847
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's actually doable, like asking that question of the old system,

289
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:00,508
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been ridiculous.

290
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:09,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just the graphically detailed questions we had to answer before were impossible for anybody to truly give a good review on every item.

291
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:16,041
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited that most of the things that I was putting a number for, I actually knew the answers to.

292
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:27,071
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made me feel really good and confident about my ratings, but there certainly were a couple of items and I can't name them off the top of my head where I kind of felt like, you know, I don't know.

293
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:30,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not that I don't know, because I don't think it's happening.

294
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:47,414
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because during the course of our work, and the pandemic obviously didn't help, during the course of our work, I didn't really feel like I had an understanding of how something was happening that we were actually supposed to review you on.

295
00:25:47,474 --> 00:25:50,656
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment, operational systems.

296
00:25:50,997 --> 00:25:56,401
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very confident that the operational systems are being worked on very aggressively, but

297
00:25:57,758 --> 00:26:00,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have a, have I ever seen a document that explains what those are?

298
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:00,800
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

299
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:09,105
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the only feedback I have is sort of to help us in the next review, which will be remarkably soon.

300
00:26:10,106 --> 00:26:23,194
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be good to also think about this list, which I don't believe will probably change for many years to come and think about how you can reveal that these items are happening to the school committee through the course of a year.

301
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:26,756
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I really had to say on that.

302
00:26:30,982 --> 00:26:31,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So member Kreatz.

303
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:33,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, hi.

304
00:26:33,903 --> 00:26:36,224
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I just want to thank my fellow committee members, Ms.

305
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:41,885
[SPEAKER_02]: McLaughlin and Mr. Russo for all their hard work collecting and compiling the ratings and feedback.

306
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:52,269
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, I won't go on because she has all the feedback, but I just want to reiterate what's in my feedback is that Dr. Edward Benson, you have done a remarkable job as superintendent.

307
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:54,309
[SPEAKER_02]: You got us through the pandemic.

308
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:56,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still transitioning.

309
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:02,372
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're, you know, we're doing very well compared to some of our other fellow, you know, communities.

310
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:05,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't be prouder to have you as our superintendent.

311
00:27:06,154 --> 00:27:10,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thank you for your leadership, your friendship, and I look forward to another successful year.

312
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:15,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

313
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:16,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

314
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:17,238
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Member Mustone.

315
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:21,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Mayor.

316
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:28,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Maurice, I just want to say I thought it was very telling that you scored so high on ethics.

317
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:41,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what really shows the community or the community already sees it, that you are such a respectable or you respect others, you're respectable, you are open minded.

318
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:49,733
[SPEAKER_01]: You listen, you think about right and wrong, and you really work together with your team and with the families and the students.

319
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:59,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was glad to see that ethical number, because I really do think you're one of the most justice-centered person I know.

320
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for being here.

321
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:03,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Mustone.

322
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:04,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Mustone.

323
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:05,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

324
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:29,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Maurice for all your hard work, I think, you know, doing a review is always sort of challenging because you're trying to encapsulate a lot of work into a few bullets and to be concise and but to be specific so it's.

325
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:32,646
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a really complicated process on its best day.

326
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:40,113
[SPEAKER_06]: It's even more complicated when we sort of throw at you seven people's like opinions of the same question.

327
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:46,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do want you to know that if you have questions about my comments in particular, I'm always happy to answer them.

328
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:54,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do know that as someone who's invested in growth mindset like yourself, that

329
00:28:54,727 --> 00:29:04,891
[SPEAKER_06]: you probably read the areas of opportunity as like the loudest, shoutiest things on this review because that is what happens when you are committed to moving forward.

330
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:22,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And so certainly making sure that you know that we weren't just like loudly shouting about the things that you could continue to progress on and do better on, but just overall your commitment over this pandemic has been remarkable.

331
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:23,518
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

332
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:25,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Graham.

333
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:26,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

334
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:27,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Graham.

335
00:29:28,815 --> 00:29:29,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm the last one.

336
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,296
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hard for me.

337
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:34,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It was January, February of 2020.

338
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:52,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I was drinking from a fire hose myself and watching you at school committee meetings and all the work that you've done, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and then all of a sudden COVID hit and we were running crazy with what to do and how to best serve our students and obviously our faculty.

339
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:59,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope through it all, you have showed true leadership.

340
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:09,203
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been responsive and communicated every step of the way, not only with the committee, but also with parents and guardians through your weekly updates.

341
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:14,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the communication has so much improved over the last year.

342
00:30:15,545 --> 00:30:17,126
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just really proud of you for that.

343
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:20,748
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that's meant a lot to me, communication and transparency.

344
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:28,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just, I really commend you and I know you're going to continue to move forward and develop into an even better superintendent.

345
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:37,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope when we're evaluating you, and I think somebody said 16 weeks, they have your response to COVID and, you know, trying to get our kids back to school and getting them back safely.

346
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:40,698
[SPEAKER_03]: You've proven to be a true leader in that area.

347
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:43,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one that we all thank you for.

348
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:46,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mayor.

349
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:48,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Rossell?

350
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:49,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

351
00:30:50,084 --> 00:31:03,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, actually, if this is usually something brought up, but the school committee doesn't review the other people on this call, the other administrators, and that's both a good and a bad thing.

352
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:13,688
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad thing is that we don't have an opportunity to say how great we think you are, and I think that a lot of my review ratings, especially the higher ones, frankly, were that

353
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:29,569
[SPEAKER_00]: that the superintendent has assembled a good team and in my comments, you'll see that it's like the execution of what's to come, the confidence in that execution is there.

354
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:39,238
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have an opportunity to review the assistant superintendents, but I hope that they take

355
00:31:40,762 --> 00:31:44,183
[SPEAKER_00]: something from this review to reflect on them as well.

356
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:47,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that is important to me.

357
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:50,525
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for your great work, all of you, frankly.

358
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:51,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

359
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:54,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, member Rousseau.

360
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:59,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And collaboration was one of my core values, the sea of aces.

361
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:06,131
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm not here without the wonderful senior leadership team that I have.

362
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:09,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, Suzanne, Dave, and Joan,

363
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:20,038
[SPEAKER_08]: and Tom who have been with us working hard to make Medford Public Schools the best district in the Commonwealth.

364
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:24,680
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is a shared evaluation between all of us.

365
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:36,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thank you for recognizing that they are part of the team and that I cannot do this work alone without the power of a team.

366
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:37,688
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

367
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,714
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think the members of my senior leadership team as well.

368
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:51,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this will be posted publicly one way or another, whether that be the website, most likely the website.

369
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:56,919
[SPEAKER_03]: If nobody else has any further comments, is there a motion to adjourn?

370
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor, I think, do we have to motion to accept the review?

371
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,940
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.

372
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to accept the review.

373
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:07,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

374
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:08,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

375
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

376
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, roll call.

377
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:14,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Kathy Kreatz?

378
00:33:14,831 --> 00:33:16,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

379
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:17,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

380
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:17,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

381
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:20,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

382
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Mustone?

383
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:22,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

384
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:24,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau?

385
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:25,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

386
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:27,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Van der Kloot?

387
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:27,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

388
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:30,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

389
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:31,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

390
00:33:31,454 --> 00:33:33,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

391
00:33:33,355 --> 00:33:34,595
[SPEAKER_03]: The review is accepted.

392
00:33:35,742 --> 00:33:37,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn.

393
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:39,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.

394
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:50,354
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember Andrew knows these things much better than me, but I, I believe we also have to put this on the agenda for Monday to vote this in the general meeting as well.

395
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:51,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to make sure that that happens.

396
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:53,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we probably should.

397
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:56,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

398
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, now I get confused on that one.

399
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:02,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.

400
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:04,743
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because it's a committee of the whole, not a subcommittee.

401
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:11,086
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, usually we would move something from the committee of the whole to the regular.

402
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:20,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to officially move this to regular agenda for Monday night to be officially approved by member Rousseau, seconded by member.

403
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:24,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, may I make a suggested motion?

404
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:26,977
[SPEAKER_05]: it.

405
00:34:27,077 --> 00:34:35,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I think that it would make more sense to have it reported out at the, um, regular school committee meeting as opposed to another committee of the whole meeting.

406
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,552
[SPEAKER_05]: That is Monday night.

407
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:38,973
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

408
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:39,313
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

409
00:34:39,354 --> 00:34:39,934
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Monday night.

410
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:40,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

411
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:41,156
[SPEAKER_05]: And may I

412
00:34:42,108 --> 00:34:42,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

413
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:42,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

414
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:43,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

415
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:58,233
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also, again, if we could, I would like to make a motion to move to the rules, policy and equity subcommittee, a process, a narrative process for the evaluation moving forward.

416
00:34:58,793 --> 00:35:10,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, a step-by-step written, you know, here's what we do first, here's what we do second, we look it all over and then bring it back to the committee as a whole to either pass or not pass.

417
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:16,786
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think for posterity, in addition to these forms that were created that were very helpful, there needs to be step-by-step guidance.

418
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:23,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to report this to regular school committee on Monday night for official approval.

419
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:26,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And a second motion to refer

420
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:35,815
