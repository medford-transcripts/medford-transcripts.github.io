1
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:08,576
It wasn't fixed and now it's still saying there's a engagement and strategic planning meeting 5 to 6 30 tonight, and it doesn't list this one.

2
00:00:09,196 --> 00:00:18,401
So this, this meeting is posted on the main page on the main page of the website if you scroll to the bottom it has today's meeting posted.

3
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:25,325
So if it's a second, a second posting we've we've tried to get it on the front page.

4
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:28,639
The upcoming meetings right now.

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:37,770
So I can definitely, I didn't realize that the other calendar had incorrect information.

6
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,593
So I will get it there as well.

7
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:45,579
But today's meeting is posted on the main page at the bottom.

8
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:46,220
Okay.

9
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:48,775
I just want to make sure it's posted somewhere.

10
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,856
Let's see.

11
00:00:50,316 --> 00:01:00,142
And Susie just sent the revised schedule to Rachel right now as well to see if she can make those adjustments on that other calendar.

12
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:01,082
Awesome.

13
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:01,703
Great, great.

14
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:02,023
Thank you.

15
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:02,343
Thank you.

16
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:03,404
Okay.

17
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:05,905
Mayor?

18
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:07,626
Yes, Member Graham?

19
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:10,388
Are we still a physical posting city?

20
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:11,349
So in other words,

21
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:22,057
isn't the question whether Clerk Hurtubise has this physically posted in order for it to be a compliant meeting?

22
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:23,458
Is that correct still?

23
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:24,259
Yes.

24
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,762
Okay, so does the clerk have this meeting posted?

25
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:28,823
Yes.

26
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:29,924
Oh, okay.

27
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,346
Yes.

28
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,849
All meetings are sent to the clerk's office first.

29
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,030
He gets it.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:37,831
Okay.

31
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:39,092
First listing, yes.

32
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:47,636
Um, and then, you know, questions about not being a physical posting city, I think are important ones for the city to take up.

33
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:56,901
But, um, as it relates to compliance with the open meeting lie, I think as long as it's posted with the clerk, we're okay.

34
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:58,982
I'll be right.

35
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:00,923
Yeah, I think officially we're okay.

36
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:04,585
I just still have an issue with it being wrong on the school website.

37
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:05,285
Oh, yeah.

38
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,307
I just just want to make sure it nicely that we, you know,

39
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:19,752
try to get all Susie and Lisa and Rachel Powery now who's involved in the calendar to make sure they're talking every day and getting the right information out.

40
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:23,113
Mayor, Lisa Evangelista has her hand raised.

41
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:23,913
Oh, yep.

42
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:26,094
Hi, Mayor.

43
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:26,854
Hi, Lisa.

44
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:37,176
I know it's confusing, I'm sorry, but it's always posted, obviously Susie sends it to Adam first, Jackie gets it, so it's put on the website.

45
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:39,217
I put it on the website.

46
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:43,025
It's also on the blog and it's also sent to all the PTO Facebook pages.

47
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:47,427
So we do try to get the word out as best we can.

48
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:54,410
As for the calendar, Rachel always handled it just because the physical plant

49
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,844
of the buildings who are under community schools.

50
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:05,870
And so that's why she was assigned the master calendar, because they needed to know who was in the buildings at what time and for how long.

51
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,734
So with school committee not being in buildings right now, I think it just went by the wayside.

52
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:16,318
So I'm gonna take the blame for that because Susie is new and she wouldn't have known that either.

53
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:21,722
So anyway, now we all know, so we'll make sure Rachel's in the loop.

54
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:23,062
Okay, awesome.

55
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,929
Okay, from now on then if a meeting is changed.

56
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:31,254
The website and the calendar are two different things and unfortunately I handle by two different people.

57
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:33,696
Okay, so when the change comes in, Ms.

58
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:42,523
Wise does the agendas, so you'll send the changes to Rachel and Lisa.

59
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:43,224
Okay.

60
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:43,924
Okay.

61
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:44,905
Perfect, thank you.

62
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,486
All right, sorry, thank you.

63
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:47,107
No, that's okay.

64
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,600
All right, we're recording, we're live.

65
00:03:50,580 --> 00:04:09,330

Signed, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent of schools.

79
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:06,218
I know we have member McLaughlin to thank for coordinating all of the evaluations.

80
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:08,418
Thank you, member McLaughlin.

81
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:12,084
You're welcome, Mayor.

82
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:18,428
And also, Member Russo, for creating the templates, because it would have been double the job had those not existed.

83
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,930
So I'm happy that they exist.

84
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,891
Thank you, Member Russo.

85
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:24,973
And we'll have them for next time around to guide the process.

86
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:25,933
So that was really helpful.

87
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:26,614
Yes.

88
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:27,635
Thank you, Member Russo.

89
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:28,355
Very helpful.

90
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:32,458
Is there anything you want to screen share?

91
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:35,000
Or does anybody have questions?

92
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:39,663
Would you like us to screen share, Mayor?

93
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:40,123
I can do that.

94
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:43,639
I think that might be best, and we can discuss from there.

95
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,060
Okay.

96
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,082
I just have a quick question, a process question.

97
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:49,643
Thank you.

98
00:06:51,285 --> 00:07:03,393
I apologize for not knowing this, but there is, I believe there's a state system that the review is input by Mr. Murphy or somebody that is a compliance requirement like this.

99
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:06,655
We don't just create this spreadsheet and then file it away.

100
00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:08,076
The state gets it.

101
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:24,574
Um, and, um, I just wanna, um, understand, you know, that submission, um, what, you know, for the numbers that will be going over, I'm pretty clear that that's exactly what they'll be expecting.

102
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:33,776
Um, but from the feedback perspective, um, I'm not really sure what the form is that, you know, if the feedback even gets put into the state system or not.

103
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:37,677
And, um, I'm just curious if anybody does know that detail because

104
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:47,671
I think feedback, at least for myself, was certainly a harder part of this, and where that's gonna go and how that's gonna go matters, I think.

105
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:52,333
Dr. Edward-Vincent?

106
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:59,235
We do have a system, TeachPoint, and it will go into that portal.

107
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:11,839
And then the hard copy of all of the documents will go into my hard file that is kept in HR.

108
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:22,061
So the hard copy of all the documents that were sent to me will be collated and placed in the hard file.

109
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,382
For DESE purposes of reporting, it's the rating that gets

110
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:35,866
the overall rating is what ends up getting reported in the DESE portal.

111
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,631
Great, thank you.

112
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,391
Member McLaughlin?

113
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:51,594
So I'm wondering, based on what Member Rousseau was just saying a moment ago, do we need

114
00:08:53,548 --> 00:09:06,240
a motion that these forms are used and moved forward in the future through DESE, or are you just saying that this is part of the process that already exists within DESE that they get these forms?

115
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:10,124
Do we need to formally accept these forms now that they've been created?

116
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,286
I'm wondering about process as well.

117
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:15,909
I think because this particular

118
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:26,109
you know, last go around when I got it, it wasn't as comprehensive with the, you know, the spreadsheet and the tables.

119
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,873
So this kind of gives a very detailed breakout.

120
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:42,700
So this whole document can be probably attached as an artifact or attached to the spreadsheet.

121
00:09:44,553 --> 00:10:02,191
the portal, but like all the documents that were submitted, I will just have all of this kept in the hard file and then uploaded to the portal so that DESE has it as a record.

122
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:08,117
But it's the rating that normally is what goes into the system, the official rating.

123
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,023
So can you guys see this?

124
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:30,265
Are you seeing my screen now?

125
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:31,485
Yeah, okay.

126
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:36,567
I know it's hard to read with the feedback, so I can just collapse the files on the feedback.

127
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:50,813
So we're just looking at, if you guys want, Mayor, we're just looking at the measure and the score, or do you wanna leave open the feedback cells as well, and I can just scroll over for each member?

128
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,114
Like, how do you guys wanna do this?

129
00:10:53,485 --> 00:11:04,448
We can go over maybe the scores first and then just briefly discuss anything that wants to be discussed as far as the comments go.

130
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:06,149
Okay.

131
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:13,411
Do you guys want me to collapse the cells so that it's easier to just see these or do you want to, are you fine with just leaving them open?

132
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:14,671
Give me some direction.

133
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,992
I think, I mean, I think I could read them the way they are.

134
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:21,553
If you want to scroll down as I go standard based on curriculum,

135

195
00:15:12,186 --> 00:15:12,386
Mayor?

196
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:13,547
Yes, Member Van de Kloet.

197
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,921
Yes, you're done, right?

198
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,021
Yes, thank you.

199
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:37,985
So I just have to say that this is really an outstanding review for a new superintendent, or a still newish superintendent, if you would.

200
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:49,169
That not one of the numbers is lower than a three, and most of them are 3.5 or higher is just truly remarkable.

201
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:59,516
So, you know, the overall picture that we see here is of a very strong performance by the superintendent.

202
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:05,741
For the sake of the audience, I just want to mention that it's a numbers we were reading was a score.

203
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:09,987
each of the committee members rated the superintendent.

204
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:16,331
One was the lowest rating that she could receive in an area and four was the highest.

205
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:20,353
And we could differentiate by doing a 3.5.

206
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:25,857
But what you're seeing is that in all areas, the superintendent

207
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:37,641
had a very strong showing where not only the majority of the committee, but the whole committee thought that she was doing work of three or higher.

208
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,723
Remembering 4.0 is the very highest.

209
00:16:43,123 --> 00:16:48,325
And we saw the breakdown of the sheets in some areas, people gave her fours completely.

210
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:53,167
You know, we did it a little bit differently.

211
00:16:54,548 --> 00:17:07,152
In the future, I'd like to spend a little bit more time talking through each of the areas with my fellow committee members, just so that we're all sure that we're rating the particular item in the correct way.

212
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:11,794
But again, really, congratulations, Superintendent.

213
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,135
I have to say this is a very, very strong showing.

214
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:22,143
And I think that when you opened it up today, we must have seen that that smile must have lit up your office for sure.

215
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,681
Thank you so much, member van de Kloet.

216
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:28,022
Thank you so much, members of the school committee.

217
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:48,529
I was really pleased, very happy with the evaluation and the level of complexity, the spreadsheet and being able to look at the feedback and read the narratives and the descriptions that went

218
00:17:49,369 --> 00:18:14,321
that were given so I know that a lot of time and work went into that process and I appreciate it incredibly and I'm you know very honored and I always say in my communications that I am the proud superintendent of Medford Public Schools and this evaluation confirms that we

219
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:21,304
believe that the work that needs to be done in Medford is the work that is taking place.

220
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:26,325
And I am committed to continuing to work hard.

221
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:43,490
And since you as a school committee member, members as a team gave fractional improvements where there are areas that clearly I can continue to push myself and strive.

222
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,472
for those fours, I'm gonna continue to do that.

223
00:18:48,072 --> 00:19:04,182
And so I will continue to keep applying myself and looking at the areas where there was more constructive feedback, where the opinion was that I could be doing more, and I will continue to try to do that.

224
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:06,384
Thank you.

225
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:09,326
Thank you, Member Van de Kloot.

226
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:10,546
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

227
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:11,607
Member McLaughlin?

228
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:13,128
And then Member Russo?

229
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,420
Thank you.

230
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,982
I also wanted to say thank you Dr. Edward Vincent, it's been a pleasure working with you.

231
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:34,868
And it was really interesting to be able to put this data together I actually, you know, it was tedious for sure, but it was really interesting because it let me do a deep dive into the evaluations and really see sort of where the members were and be able to do some comparative

232
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:42,500
sort of, you know, layperson analysis, if you will, or what have you, and the narrative was really helpful as well.

233
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,128
And, and I think the message is very much that, you know, we're, we're fortunate to have you.

234
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:51,302
You're doing a great job in a lot of areas.

235
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:54,804
I think this evaluation certainly shows your strengths.

236
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:58,346
And I also think it does show us where we have some work to do.

237
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:01,387
And I'm looking forward to working.

238
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:13,314
I think that for every member here that was able to share where there was work to do, there was full confidence that you recognize that and are capable and able to be a leader in those realms.

239
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:15,095
So I'm excited about that, especially

240
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:18,218
with a review like this again on year number three.

241
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:19,740
So I think that this is great.

242
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:34,617
And just for the record, Mayor, also, I'm assuming this is, I know that the superintendent was saying that this goes in to the file, and I'm assuming, you know, these are public records, obviously, we're showing them in a public meeting, so folks can see them if they want to look further.

243
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:35,699
Is that accurate, Mayor?

244
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:42,604
This is my actually first time evaluating the superintendent.

245
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:44,705
Member Van de Kloot, can you speak to that at all?

246
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:46,965
Do you know where the evaluations usually go?

247
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:50,146
You know, I don't know.

248
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:59,430
We always did them in public or we did a, you know, spoke about our evaluations in public.

249
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,311
Then they were given to the superintendent.

250
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:05,712
I would assume that it's just a public,

251
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:11,855
you know, paper, which is available to the public, but I don't know how we want to post it.

252
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:18,178
Just in response to that, I do also want to say, if I could, Mayor, is it okay for me to just respond?

253
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,658
Yes, Member McLaughlin, then Member Rizzo.

254
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:20,258
Yep.

255
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:28,722
Just in response to that too, I just want to, again, I think that this is a really great example of process and, you know, what didn't occur in the past.

256
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:33,984
And so I think both having a narrative that explains what this process is, and as Member van de Kloot was saying,

257
00:21:34,324 --> 00:22:01,927
having some discussion about these you know individual items and also as the superintendent is evaluating herself knowing that this will be the form um when she does her self-evaluation that will be um the rubric that we'll be working with so that it will help inform that and the process as well I think is really critical so I think also for those who are watching the good news is is that there's a process in place there's a form that you know is existing we'll be using moving forward and um I think rules policy and

258
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:07,849
the equity subcommittee is a good example of sort of really getting these policies moving and putting things into place.

259
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,949
So I'm very happy to see this.

260
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:17,851
And again, I want to thank the committee for putting the processes in place and making them transparent.

261
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:18,291
Thank you.

262
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:22,193
Member McLaughlin, member Rousseau?

263
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:25,293
Mayor, could I go after member Rousseau?

264
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:28,314
Yes, member, member Kratz, I didn't see you there.

265
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:29,415
Okay, no problem, that's fine.

266
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:30,375
Okay, thanks.

267
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:34,679
Thank you.

268
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:37,100
We will be doing this all over in 16 weeks.

269
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:44,024
So one of the side effects of being so late is that we will actually gain practice in a shorter amount of time than normal.

270
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:54,691
So I hope everybody, as I was writing my own comments and trying to do the review, it was challenging to realize that this is not for this year.

271
00:22:54,711 --> 00:23:00,915
And I think when people, if anybody in the public is looking at this,

272
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:09,322
I think it's important to remember that this is for the year ending June 30, 2020, 30, 31, whatever the numbers are.

273
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,963
So we will be at this again in very short order.

274
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:30,506
And the only other, the only additional feedback from what's in here is that, you know, the superintendent, I don't believe lived through the previous protocol for doing a review, which was absolutely horrible.

275
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:34,609
pages and pages of questions for which we didn't have answers.

276
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:39,631
And this was a huge improvement that the state put through, DESE, I believe.

277
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:46,154
And it's great, but it still does have some of the shortcomings that the old system had.

278
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:56,078
And that is that we may be asked a question, I'm just looking at the current screen, you know, lesson development support.

279
00:23:56,098 --> 00:23:59,179
I mean, there's a paragraph somewhere that tells you what that means.

280
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,560
And

281
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:11,787
as with the old system, but in much, much less severity, individual members may not actually be able to answer the question.

282
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,007
The problem is, is that we must answer the question.

283
00:24:15,227 --> 00:24:17,268
We must put a number for every item.

284
00:24:17,648 --> 00:24:18,808
There's not optionals.

285
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:30,010
So I would just urge the superintendent and her team to think about each of these items and realize that the members

286
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:47,280
really appreciate a lot, having had work product presented in some fashion, whether it's simply a report or in some partisan presentation, that will allow us to feel like we have a clue what that thing meant when we get to the review.

287
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,964
And again, you know, this this is a dramatically better review process than the old one.

288
00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:58,847
And I feel like it's actually doable, like asking that question of the old system,

289
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:00,508
would have been ridiculous.

290
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:09,736
I mean, just the graphically detailed questions we had to answer before were impossible for anybody to truly give a good review on every item.

291
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:16,041
So I'm excited that most of the things that I was putting a number for, I actually knew the answers to.

292
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:27,071
And that made me feel really good and confident about my ratings, but there certainly were a couple of items and I can't name them off the top of my head where I kind of felt like, you know, I don't know.

293
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:30,640
I mean, it's not that I don't know, because I don't think it's happening.

294
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:47,414
It's because during the course of our work, and the pandemic obviously didn't help, during the course of our work, I didn't really feel like I had an understanding of how something was happening that we were actually supposed to review you on.

295
00:25:47,474 --> 00:25:50,656
The environment, operational systems.

296
00:25:50,997 --> 00:25:56,401
I'm very confident that the operational systems are being worked on very aggressively, but

297
00:25:57,758 --> 00:26:00,740
Do I have a, have I ever seen a document that explains what those are?

298
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:00,800
No.

299
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:09,105
So that's just the only feedback I have is sort of to help us in the next review, which will be remarkably soon.

300
00:26:10,106 --> 00:26:23,194
It would be good to also think about this list, which I don't believe will probably change for many years to come and think about how you can reveal that these items are happening to the school committee through the course of a year.

301
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:26,756
So that's all I really had to say on that.

302
00:26:30,982 --> 00:26:31,722
So member Kratz.

303
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:33,803
Yes, hi.

304
00:26:33,903 --> 00:26:36,224
First, I just want to thank my fellow committee members, Ms.

305
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:41,885
McLaughlin and Mr. Russo for all their hard work collecting and compiling the ratings and feedback.

306
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:52,269
And I just, I won't go on because she has all the feedback, but I just want to reiterate what's in my feedback is that Dr. Edward Benson, you have done a remarkable job as superintendent.

307
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:54,309
You got us through the pandemic.

308
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:56,270
We're still transitioning.

309
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:02,372
and we're, you know, we're doing very well compared to some of our other fellow, you know, communities.

310
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:05,633
I couldn't be prouder to have you as our superintendent.

311
00:27:06,154 --> 00:27:10,956
And I thank you for your leadership, your friendship, and I look forward to another successful year.

312
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:15,477
Thank you very much.

313
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:16,278
Thank you.

314
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:17,238
That's Member McStone.

315
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:21,823
Thanks, Mayor.

316
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:28,025
Dr. Maurice, I just want to say I thought it was very telling that you scored so high on ethics.

317
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:41,810
And I think that's what really shows the community or the community already sees it, that you are such a respectable or you respect others, you're respectable, you are open minded.

318
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:49,733
You listen, you think about right and wrong, and you really work together with your team and with the families and the students.

319
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:59,557
And I was glad to see that ethical number, because I really do think you're one of the most justice-centered person I know.

320
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,817
So thank you for being here.

321
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:03,698
Thank you, Member McStone.

322
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:04,939
Thank you, Member McStone.

323
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:05,439
Member Graham?

324
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:29,503
Thank you, Maurice for all your hard work, I think, you know, doing a review is always sort of challenging because you're trying to encapsulate a lot of work into a few bullets and to be concise and but to be specific so it's.

325
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:32,646
it's a really complicated process on its best day.

326
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:40,113
It's even more complicated when we sort of throw at you seven people's like opinions of the same question.

327
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:46,459
So I do want you to know that if you have questions about my comments in particular, I'm always happy to answer them.

328
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:54,087
And I do know that as someone who's invested in growth mindset like yourself, that

329
00:28:54,727 --> 00:29:04,891
you probably read the areas of opportunity as like the loudest, shoutiest things on this review because that is what happens when you are committed to moving forward.

330
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:22,037
And so certainly making sure that you know that we weren't just like loudly shouting about the things that you could continue to progress on and do better on, but just overall your commitment over this pandemic has been remarkable.

331
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:23,518
So thank you.

332
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:25,313
Thank you, Member Graham.

333
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:26,214
Thank you so much.

334
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:27,714
Thank you, Member Graham.

335
00:29:28,815 --> 00:29:29,955
I think I'm the last one.

336
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,296
It was hard for me.

337
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:34,497
It was January, February of 2020.

338
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:52,865
I was drinking from a fire hose myself and watching you at school committee meetings and all the work that you've done, Dr. Edward Vincent, and then all of a sudden COVID hit and we were running crazy with what to do and how to best serve our students and obviously our faculty.

339
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:59,737
And I hope through it all, you have showed true leadership.

340
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:09,203
You've been responsive and communicated every step of the way, not only with the committee, but also with parents and guardians through your weekly updates.

341
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:14,926
I think the communication has so much improved over the last year.

342
00:30:15,545 --> 00:30:17,126
And I'm just really proud of you for that.

343
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:20,748
It's something that's meant a lot to me, communication and transparency.

344
00:30:20,808 --> 00:30:28,371
So I just, I really commend you and I know you're going to continue to move forward and develop into an even better superintendent.

345
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:37,556
And I hope when we're evaluating you, and I think somebody said 16 weeks, they have your response to COVID and, you know, trying to get our kids back to school and getting them back safely.

346
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:40,698
You've proven to be a true leader in that area.

347
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:43,339
And it's one that we all thank you for.

348
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:46,003
Thank you, Mayor.

349
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:48,063
Member Rossell?

350
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:49,644
Thank you.

351
00:30:50,084 --> 00:31:03,666
I don't know, actually, if this is usually something brought up, but the school committee doesn't review the other people on this call, the other administrators, and that's both a good and a bad thing.

352
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:13,688
The bad thing is that we don't have an opportunity to say how great we think you are, and I think that a lot of my review ratings, especially the higher ones, frankly, were that

353
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:29,569
that the superintendent has assembled a good team and in my comments, you'll see that it's like the execution of what's to come, the confidence in that execution is there.

354
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:39,238
So we don't have an opportunity to review the assistant superintendents, but I hope that they take

355
00:31:40,762 --> 00:31:44,183
something from this review to reflect on them as well.

356
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:47,324
I know that that is important to me.

357
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:50,525
So thank you for your great work, all of you, frankly.

358
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:51,566
Yes.

359
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:54,327
Thank you, member Rousseau.

360
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:59,749
And collaboration was one of my core values, the sea of aces.

361
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:06,131
And so I'm not here without the wonderful senior leadership team that I have.

362
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:09,212
Peter, Suzanne, Dave, and Joan,

363
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:20,038
and Tom who have been with us working hard to make Medford Public Schools the best district in the Commonwealth.

364
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:24,680
And so this is a shared evaluation between all of us.

365
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:36,787
And I thank you for recognizing that they are part of the team and that I cannot do this work alone without the power of a team.

366
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:37,688
So thank you.

367
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,714
and I think the members of my senior leadership team as well.

368
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:51,657
Okay, so this will be posted publicly one way or another, whether that be the website, most likely the website.

369
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:56,919
If nobody else has any further comments, is there a motion to adjourn?

370
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,900
Mayor, I think, do we have to motion to accept the review?

371
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,940
I think.

372
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,201
Motion to accept the review.

373
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:07,009
Second.

374
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:08,549
Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

375
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,550
Roll call.

376
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,210
Yeah, roll call.

377
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:14,211
Kathy Kretz?

378
00:33:14,831 --> 00:33:16,511
Yes.

379
00:33:16,591 --> 00:33:17,151
Member Graham?

380
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:17,991
Yes.

381
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:20,172
Member McLaughlin, yes.

382
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,912
Member Stone?

383
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:22,492
Yes.

384
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:24,533
Member Rousseau?

385
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:25,393
Yes.

386
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:27,393
Member Van de Kloot?

387
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:27,874
Yes.

388
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:30,154
Mayor Lungo-Kern?

389
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:31,034
Yes.

390
00:33:31,454 --> 00:33:33,015
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

391
00:33:33,355 --> 00:33:34,595
The review is accepted.

392
00:33:35,742 --> 00:33:37,624
Motion to adjourn.

393
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:39,625
Oh, sorry.

394
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:50,354
I just remember Andrew knows these things much better than me, but I, I believe we also have to put this on the agenda for Monday to vote this in the general meeting as well.

395
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:51,835
Just want to make sure that that happens.

396
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:53,916
Yeah, we probably should.

397
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:56,238
I don't know.

398
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,981
Yeah, now I get confused on that one.

399
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:02,762
Yeah, I don't know.

400
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:04,743
It's because it's a committee of the whole, not a subcommittee.

401
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:11,086
But yes, usually we would move something from the committee of the whole to the regular.

402
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:20,151
Motion to officially move this to regular agenda for Monday night to be officially approved by member Rousseau, seconded by member.

403
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:24,133
Actually, may I make a suggested motion?

404
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:26,977
it.

405
00:34:27,077 --> 00:34:35,829
I guess I think that it would make more sense to have it reported out at the, um, regular school committee meeting as opposed to another committee of the whole meeting.

406
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,552
That is Monday night.

407
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:38,973
That's right.

408
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:39,313
That's right.

409
00:34:39,354 --> 00:34:39,934
That's Monday night.

410
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:40,175
Sorry.

411
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:41,156
And may I

412
00:34:42,108 --> 00:34:42,288
Yes.

413
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:42,948
Member McLaughlin.

414
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:43,548
Yeah.

415
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:58,233
And then also, again, if we could, I would like to make a motion to move to the rules, policy and equity subcommittee, a process, a narrative process for the evaluation moving forward.

416
00:34:58,793 --> 00:35:10,501
So in other words, a step-by-step written, you know, here's what we do first, here's what we do second, we look it all over and then bring it back to the committee as a whole to either pass or not pass.

417
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:16,786
But I think for posterity, in addition to these forms that were created that were very helpful, there needs to be step-by-step guidance.

418
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:23,631
Motion to report this to regular school committee on Monday night for official approval.

419
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:26,653
And a second motion to refer

420
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:35,815
the process to the rules, policy and equity subcommittee to create a process and timeline for how to evaluate superintendent moving forward.

421
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:38,517
Sorry, I seconded member Russo's.

422
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:41,799
I'm sorry, I should have taken a roll call for that before I made the second motion.

423
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:42,759
My apologies, Mayor.

424
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,023
Okay, motion by member Russo, seconded by member McLaughlin to move this to the regular school committee for an official vote.

425
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:51,504
Roll call.

426
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:53,045
Member Kratz?

427
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:53,686
Yes.

428
00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:55,026
Member Graham?

429
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:55,687
Yes.

430
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:58,625
Member McLaughlin, yes.

431
00:35:58,705 --> 00:35:59,906
Member McStone?

432
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:00,326
Yes.

433
00:36:02,188 --> 00:36:02,849
Member Russo?

434
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:03,789
Yes.

435
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,011
Member Van de Kloet?

436
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:05,511
Yes.

437
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:06,692
Mayor Lungo Kern?

438
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:09,134
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

439
00:36:09,675 --> 00:36:11,176
Now your motion, Member McLaughlin?

440
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:12,057
Yes.

441
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:13,358
To create a policy.

442
00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:15,500
Great policy.

443
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,342
Seconded by Member Van de Kloet.

444
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:18,964
Roll call.

445
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:21,366

Yes.

447
00:36:24,343 --> 00:36:25,183
Member Kretz?

448
00:36:25,764 --> 00:36:25,944
Yes.

449
00:36:27,044 --> 00:36:28,125
Member McLaughlin, yes.

450
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:28,865

Yes.

458
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,730
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

459
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:42,872
Thank you to that subcommittee.

460
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:44,593
Motion to adjourn?

461
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:50,515
Motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kretz.

462
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:51,736

Yes.

Yes.

469

Yes.

471
