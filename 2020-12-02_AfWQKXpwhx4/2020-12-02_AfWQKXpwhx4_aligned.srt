9
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,090
So the objectives for today's meeting,

10
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:32,040
are to discuss stakeholder requirements for improved and seamless communications, outline and review current technical supports and systems used by MPS.

11
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,804
This communication strategy work is being developed based on the below approved school committee resolution.

12
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:49,355
Be it resolved that the communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee begin a district-wide effort to develop a communication strategy roadmap that examines our current communications processes and technology system views.

13
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:59,192
Be it also resolved that the strategy work explores our efforts to reach all audiences, including families and staff within the district, and recommend improvements to increase our success.

14
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:07,097
Be it also resolved that the strategy effort review the MPS website and recommended changes to improve the quality of the content therein.

15
00:02:08,438 --> 00:02:15,962
And so today, what we talked about doing today was specifically to focus on

16
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:41,258
some of the technology platforms, and more importantly, the requirements or the opportunities that we see as a collective whole to start to inform having some systemic ways and processes to make sure this communication is able to be pushed out in various methods in a timely fashion.

17
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:55,132
According to the agenda, I think one of the first things we wanted to spend a little bit of time talking about was our district's goals around the communication strategy efforts.

18
00:02:56,273 --> 00:03:07,376
And then we'll talk about opportunities and any requirements that various stakeholder groups may have or want to share about communication in general.

19
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,897
And then talk a little bit about

20
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:29,631
what we have in place today that is used so that we can figure out what the next steps are to not only understanding where we're at and what we feel like we need, but then, you know, creating a pathway to being able to identify what is missing.

21
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:39,717
And in some cases, I imagine prioritize related spending if that becomes necessary, if there are tools needed that we don't have.

22
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:48,439
So I think the first thing on the agenda, really just to talk about our overall goals around communication.

23
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:52,001
And I do see some members of the public have joined us.

24
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:58,705
So I wanna encourage you guys all to participate as well, but I'll open the floor.

25
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:00,446
What's that?

26
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:03,487
Do you wanna take attendance?

27
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:04,188
Oh, yes.

28
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:07,970
Member McLaughlin.

29
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,870
Present.

30
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,331
And member Kratz.

31
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:12,672
And member Graham.

32
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:17,296
So three present and zero absent.

33
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:19,458
Thank you.

34
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:31,207
So I think the first, you know, the first agenda item from my standpoint is more discussion oriented around our goals for communication across the district.

35
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:39,234
And certainly it's hard to talk about goals without talking about opportunities sort of mixed in with those goals.

36
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:42,876
I'm happy for that conversation to flow however it flows.

37
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:50,360
But I didn't know if there was anyone who wanted to start or offer a starting point.

38
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,382
And then, Susie, I'm making an assumption that you're taking notes.

39
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:58,604
But if that's not the case, just let me know so I can try to grab them as we go.

40
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:00,345
I am taking notes.

41
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:01,205
OK, perfect.

42
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:04,247
And do you want me to be time keeper, Jenny?

43
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:05,448
That would be great.

44
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:08,429
OK, so it's five minutes.

45
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:17,212
All right, so district.

46
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:23,657
So I guess the first agenda item is around goals for our communication strategy effort.

47
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:37,407
And I have heard a number of things voiced certainly in the community over time that talk about the communication strategy in a bigger sense, but as it relates to

48
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:54,345
what our expectations are of the district as a community and what the district's expectations are of being able to communicate with parents and members of the community.

49
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:56,587
So I think that's a good place to start.

50
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:02,090
And I don't know if anyone has anything they want to offer.

51
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,412
Melanie?

52
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,191
Yeah, just a point of information.

53
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:10,253
Are you asking what other current district goals around communication?

54
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:19,179
I wasn't asking that because I think I was making an assumption that we don't have.

55
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,762
Stated goals around.

56
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:26,704
Communication, but maybe that is a good place to start.

57
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,928
If we do have stated goals around communication,

58
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:34,243
that would be a good place to start.

59
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:36,824
And if not, perhaps that's the conversation we should be having.

60
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:50,607
The superintendent was talking to us just before this meeting, but the phone was cutting out.

61
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:51,947
And so I'm not sure if Ms.

62
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:56,428
Galussi or Dr. Cushing know if that connection was reestablished.

63
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:00,109
And if not, I think

64
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:12,302
we can do our best to bridge that gap until Dr. Edward-Vincent is back, but I know she was just in transit, so I think it'll just take a minute or two, but could you, Ms.

65
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:14,162
Graham, could you just repeat that question one more time?

66
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:30,668
Sure, I think Melanie was asking a question that made me sort of realize I've jumped to a conclusion, which is that we don't have a stated set of goals around communications

67
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:32,724
across the district.

68
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:43,052
And I think to be fair, maybe we do, and people just don't know what they are, but it's, I think it's okay if we don't just yet either.

69
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:49,437
So, I think I would be inclined to defer to Dr. Cushing and Ms.

70
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:51,339
Glucy specifically because I know that

71
00:07:52,200 --> 00:08:00,344
the committee and the administration were in the development of the formation of a strategic plan over the course of the last year.

72
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:06,287
I know that's something that this, I think it's the subcommittee, but perhaps it was a different one, was engaged in as well.

73
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:18,594
And I think that while that's still in development and draft form, I would imagine that that is an articulation as to the substantive goals.

74
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:21,275
And from a communications perspective,

75
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:35,843
I think every strategic plan is in some respects a communication vehicle because it is informing all constituencies as to where the concentration of the work is and what the focus is.

76
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:46,590
And so to the degree that building awareness and knowledge of those goals so that people understand the identity of the Medford Public Schools and

77
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:57,477
what is being prioritized and probably most importantly, why the impact that that has both on bringing about greater equity and just expanding the opportunities that students enjoy.

78
00:08:57,497 --> 00:09:15,283
I don't know that there's a more specific articulation other than this is the substantive educational mission and how do we most effectively inform the community and prospective stakeholders certainly in order to build that awareness.

79
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:16,104
I'm not sure if that's,

80
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:21,848
That's sort of from what I've seen in terms of what has been developed and certainly the work that we're doing.

81
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:29,534
I think the only other thing I would say is that in the moment, every goal is being influenced by COVID-19.

82
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:35,739
And I take your question to sort of extend beyond the particular crisis that we're in.

83
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,784
But I think for administrators right now, and probably for educators, for everybody,

84
00:09:42,873 --> 00:10:02,927
the pandemic is so all-consuming in terms of how it affects the operations of the organization, we are expending an enormous amount of capital and energy to make sure people are informed, not so much about the breadth of the vision and the educational implications of advancing it, as much as making sure everyone's informed about how school currently operates.

85
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:11,153
And that is frustrating, frankly, because none of us sort of got into this work solely so we could make sure that we hit our

86
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,253
the percentage of students and staff tested that we want to for a virus, right?

87
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:31,685
That's not the mission of the organization, but at the moment, it is the work of the organization, because without effectively communicating how our operations are being affected, students, staff, and families are not in a position to really get what they need out of the district.

88
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:40,692
And I think that is, I think it's worth noting that because it's sort of informing how everything at the moment is prioritized, but hopefully,

89
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:45,099
You know, it's certainly not our expectation that that will last in perpetuity.

90
00:10:45,919 --> 00:11:01,002
And to follow on what Mr. Murphy was saying, under fostering collaborative relationships, the initiative on the draft strategic plan is to engage in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally proficient communications with the Medford Mustang community.

91
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:09,244
You know, our early indicators of success are established district marketing communications plan, MARCOM,

92
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:24,193
uh, established district controlled social media accounts, um, deploying a new website, um, and a district smartphone application, um, of which we have not yet received the training I mentioned because of a problem with the trainer.

93
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:37,875
Um, but there is, um, those are the early indicators of success that we are working on, um, with some other action items listed under that, uh, for future work.

94
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:47,741
I also think that some of that work also started with some of the task force meetings over the summer.

95
00:11:47,821 --> 00:12:06,385
So part of one of the task forces over the summer in the reopening of schools was geared towards specifically communication and working in that effort to keep the community informed of all of our reopening efforts and what we're doing to make sure that

96
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:25,427
the community is safe and that we're reopening our schools and all the work that went into that and some of that work has continued in the fact that we have, you know, made sure that the superintendent sends out her weekly communication on Fridays and that's something that the community now has gotten

97
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:30,750
used to seeing and expecting on Fridays, Wednesdays are the commercial day.

98
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:42,156
So I think there are some goals that maybe started over the summer that have also continued a little bit throughout the year during this COVID time, as Mr. Murphy said.

99
00:12:42,176 --> 00:12:44,597
Yeah, absolutely.

100
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:53,622
And I think some of the things that started in that task force, which I was a part of, you know, there was definitely an acknowledgement that

101
00:12:56,563 --> 00:13:08,750
It was too lofty a goal for everyone to be happy with anything we might say over the next year, because that's just like sort of not the current reality.

102
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:22,217
But we talked a lot about the fact that if people were unhappy, it wasn't at the hands of us not communicating

103
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,391
what is happening, right?

104
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:28,293
So I may not like what you're saying to me, but it's not that you're saying nothing.

105
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:34,837
So we sort of, I think that task really tried to say like, what is our reality?

106
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,478
And like, what are we trying to accomplish here?

107
00:13:36,538 --> 00:13:40,160
And we wanna make sure, you know, basic fundamental things are happening.

108
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:51,666
And I think as that program started to roll out, and I think even now, what it did sort of reveal, at least for me is that we,

109
00:13:53,173 --> 00:14:01,099
definitely didn't have good systems in place to enable the kind of communicating that we're doing.

110
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:11,047
So, I probably helped like 25 people over the course of the summer who were like, I don't get any emails and I don't know why.

111
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:14,570
And people have tried to fix it and they can't.

112
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:20,655
And so I think there are systemic issues that sort of get in the way of us being able to

113
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,411
to simply reach everybody.

114
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:30,218
So I think that's like one consideration when we're talking about having a broader strategic plan is what are those platforms that we're going to use?

115
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:31,939
Who's going to use them?

116
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,081
What are they going to be used for?

117
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:37,624
And how do we sort of drive some of that consistency?

118
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:48,873
And then there are a number of folks who have joined us from various PTOs because I think when I think about the various communities, we have certainly our PTOs

119
00:14:49,623 --> 00:15:02,353
have a unique perspective on their own school community and how communication flows within their community and the feedback that they get, but they also have like these same challenges of how do they communicate with their community.

120
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:09,938
And you can be, you know, I think it's quite easy to be on one group's mailing list and not on the other.

121
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:16,703
So I get all the emails that my PTO sends, but I get none of the emails that the administration sends, for example, or vice versa.

122
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,765
And part of that is because

123
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:24,319
I don't think we have a single way that we push out those communications.

124
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,141
They historically have happened in lots of different ways.

125
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:40,351
And I'm just curious, you know, when we talk about opportunity, for me, some of the deficiencies are around like we're spending energy helping individuals troubleshoot their email access.

126
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:45,214
We are not spending that energy actually communicating, right?

127
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:46,155
We're just troubleshooting.

128
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:47,796
So what are the ways that we could

129
00:15:51,036 --> 00:16:19,644
investigate or explore the technology that we have available to us to change how we're doing things so that that piece of the process gets a little bit more streamlined and simple so that parents could, you know, in my mind, I would like parents to be able to go to one place and know that if their information is correct in this one place that anybody district wide who's trying to communicate with them can effectively reach them.

130
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,252
And I'm not sure that exists just yet.

131
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:39,064
And then when I think about communicating, it's one thing to sort of push out a message, it's another to know that it's being received, and it's another entirely to know that it's being opened, and maybe then you extrapolate that it's been read.

132
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:49,973
And I don't know enough about our system currently to know whether that is something that is even possible in our current

133
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:51,489
technical portfolio.

134
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:53,611
So the answer to that question is yes.

135
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:58,815
And so when parents reach out to me or to anyone and say I'm not getting the emails.

136
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,318
We can actually see what time they've opened it.

137
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:14,244
We can see, you know, if for whatever reason they're not getting an email, we can see a lot of times the parents have, I think, unwittingly removed themselves from the email distribution list.

138
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,245
And we can see that.

139
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:23,730
We can also see if it's being directed to a spam folder or something along those lines to a slightly more limited degree.

140
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,292
But one parent emailed me last week.

141
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:34,814
I'm not getting them and our system says, no, you are, and this is the time that it was opened by someone.

142
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:39,556
And so that then gives the parent the opportunity to go in to see what might be happening.

143
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:42,578
Melanie?

144
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:48,020
Yeah, for a point of information, do we know that, do we have data?

145
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:54,704
I'm assuming we do, but I'm asking, do we have data on, you know, every family that we know that their emails are active?

146
00:17:55,443 --> 00:18:02,225
And I guess to Jenny's point, not just that they're being read, Jenny, but I guess to take it a step further, that they're being understood, right?

147
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:13,387
So whether it's language difficulties or, you know, the tone of the email or the way that it's written, I guess, do we know, you know, how do we know they're being read?

148
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:21,049
Like you said, you have the data that they're being read, but again, do we have a list of all the updated emails for whatever the thousands of people that we have?

149
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:24,410
And then, you know, are they actually being understood based on,

150
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,471
any response data that we might have.

151
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:28,472
Dave?

152
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:48,802
It's a fluid situation and certainly something that the district has to be vigilant about because email addresses change and we have a sensor and where we're seeing this right now is yesterday we began student testing for COVID-19.

153
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:51,663
And so there's a tremendous amount of

154
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,152
uh, data production to make sure that that works smoothly.

155
00:18:56,792 --> 00:19:02,296
And, uh, you know, obviously it's only for students for whom a consent form has been, um, submitted.

156
00:19:02,356 --> 00:19:17,724
So I'll just very quickly plug that if anyone's listening, encourage friends and family members to send in consent forms, but we have the full list and it's rare to not have operative, um, emails, but like I said, it's fluid.

157
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:19,225
So you have to constantly keep at it.

158
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:21,046
And when there are problems, address it.

159
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:35,957
mostly at the school level, to the deeper question of how do we sort of gauge the effectiveness of the communications and is it really, are people sort of digesting and processing that information?

160
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:44,763
Again, I think that's another thing you have to be vigilant about and constantly, because it's connected entirely to the relationship building between the family and the district and knowing when

161
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:46,368
there are that gaps.

162
00:19:46,748 --> 00:20:06,439
In terms of evidence of effectiveness, one thing I would point to is the surveys that have been administered with regard to the reopening had, at least just speaking for myself, I guess, in my view, a tremendous success rate in terms of responsiveness.

163
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:09,801
Now, that doesn't mean it was 100%, and you have to wonder, like,

164
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:22,551
Is it the families who are in most need of effective communication and building stronger relationships vis-a-vis the school and the student that are the ones that are in the smaller percentage for which there is no responsiveness?

165
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:29,897
But even still, this, and granted, every district families were paying close attention during the summer because everybody wanted to know, are we going back?

166
00:20:29,957 --> 00:20:30,557
Is it in person?

167
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:31,278
So on and so forth.

168
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:35,661
But even still, for the survey response rates to be as high as they were,

169
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:47,178
in the middle of the summer does speak, I think, to some degree of strength in terms of the bond in which the district relies for communication.

170
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:50,460
That's not to say, like, there isn't need for continuous improvement.

171
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,401
I think there definitely is.

172
00:20:51,861 --> 00:21:00,228
And I think it's both in terms of perfecting our methods and the mediums that we use and just ensuring strong relationships between families and schools.

173
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:09,901
because that ultimately is what's most important and what I think leads to effective channels of communication is that the relationships are there and are strong.

174
00:21:09,981 --> 00:21:14,722
So, but I just would say, I don't think it's ever like, yes, we do that well or no, we don't do it.

175
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:21,504
It just has to be something that has to be continuously improving both from a technical perspective and from a more substantive relationship building perspective.

176
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:29,566
And when you are looking at those like statistics, open rates, those kinds of things,

177
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:37,888
and you're pushing emails, are they going from school brains or are they going from school messenger?

178
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:43,731
Like I think over the summer, I heard that the two sort of talk to each other, but don't quite.

179
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:52,035
So I was just like, I don't feel like I properly understand the connection between the systems.

180
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:59,360
So School Brains is the SIMS information that's the student information management system for the district.

181
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:10,522
Every single school district, whatever it is, if it's Aspen or Redeker or iPass or fill in the blank of any other brand of product that's out there, operates with something like this.

182
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:12,542
That is what's known as a relational database.

183
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:17,363
Generally speaking, these companies offer a communications platform.

184
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:20,784
In my previous experiences with

185
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:24,923
iPass, it was called iAutoAlert.

186
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:31,445
After trying it, we realized that there are certain reasons why companies specialize in these products.

187
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:45,270
The communications piece is a very important one, and generally speaking, should be held by a company like School Messenger or Blackboard or something along those lines, because it's what they do, they're experts on it,

188
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,622
And so what these databases do is they talk to each other.

189
00:22:51,282 --> 00:23:00,425
And so when a change happens, generally speaking, at some time in the wee hours in the morning, there's an automatic update that happens between the two systems.

190
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:09,168
And so School Messenger will automatically pull from school brains to automatically update all of the information.

191
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:15,570
Now, part of the problem of why some emails or something might be wrong is data entry.

192
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:25,235
And so the issue around data entry is, is when forms come back, you have people entering the forms, checking the forms, doing those types of things.

193
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:28,576
So you may have an issue of human error.

194
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:44,900
One of the things that we are currently working to deploy is, and has been deployed, I should say not working, is right now, parents can go into School Brains across the district and they can update their demographic information.

195
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:52,602
All right, so they can log in you, Jenny Graham, Melanie Goughlin, anyone else who's a parent who has a child in the district.

196
00:23:53,022 --> 00:24:06,568
can log into SchoolBrains and you can update your phone number, you can change your email, you can check to see that there's a period where it should be in your email and not a comma or that numbers weren't transposed and you're getting the wrong information.

197
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:20,314
So those are the fundamentally critical pieces of information that now we're taking it, we're hopefully moving away from the forms and having to update those things as frequently as every year and really relying on

198
00:24:20,854 --> 00:24:25,336
families to be able to keep track and, you know, to do those things.

199
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:28,678
Now we, on our side, have to accept those changes.

200
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:38,582
It's not an automatic because, you know, sometimes students get the information and put their own email address in there.

201
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:50,388
But there are ways to avoid that, and that's how we do it, by accepting the changes, reviewing them, and school personnel handle that.

202
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:54,306
So the two systems do talk to each other.

203
00:24:55,286 --> 00:25:01,569
And we use, are we using, what is Blackboard do?

204
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:10,993
So Blackboard right now is a, is the mobile application that is being used in some schools across the district.

205
00:25:11,434 --> 00:25:13,054
We're awaiting a training date on that.

206
00:25:13,074 --> 00:25:16,936
The training date that we had was canceled due to an issue with the trainer.

207
00:25:17,456 --> 00:25:21,218
And we're just waiting on a training date to get all the principals up to speed on that.

208
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,973
And so that allows us to have a mobile application.

209
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:28,835
We're currently halfway through a three year contract.

210
00:25:30,536 --> 00:25:33,458
Last year was only deployed in limited schools to test it out.

211
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:38,582
And we're looking to make sure that that is out there across the district.

212
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:45,987
Okay, so

213
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:54,319
School brains is the piece of technology that elementary school families do not have access to.

214
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:55,000
Is that right?

215
00:25:57,602 --> 00:26:05,649
So they don't have access the way that middle school and high school does because the teachers don't record their grades within school brains.

216
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:15,037
They use it to do their report cards, but they don't upload grades and assignments in school brains the way that the secondary level does.

217
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,219
So parents do have access to go in and edit.

218
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:31,286
So if they've made, if they have a different phone number or things like that, they can edit their personal demographics, but they're not going to be able to see their children's grades the way that the secondary level will.

219
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:39,831
And do parents know that they could or should be doing that in school brains in the elementary schools?

220
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:51,820
No, when it comes to the elementary level, I think that that is something this year that Kim Miles has been working now that she's fully the one that's working with the school brains.

221
00:26:52,260 --> 00:27:02,146
She has been working on that with the school brains company so that we can get to the point where elementary families are able to edit their own personal information.

222
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:05,648
As of right now, it's done by the school based secretaries.

223
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:07,989
Got it.

224
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,030
And so

225
00:27:10,894 --> 00:27:25,020
it sounds like one of our goals, whether via the pandemic or just in a larger sense is that school brains becomes the place where all district communications come from.

226
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,341
I don't think that is what happens in practice always.

227
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:39,305
And certainly when you kind of dive down into the weeds of like how other, how principals, teachers, et cetera, communicate with parents.

228
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,511
I know that there are other tools out there that PTOs are using.

229
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:54,035
So I'm just trying to understand, like, are we, is there a concerted effort for us all to be sort of funneling to Schoolbrains?

230
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,576
Is that what you're saying?

231
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:59,577
So Schoolbrains is not the communication vehicle.

232
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:00,458
Right.

233
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:01,598
School Messenger, Facebook.

234
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,680
But it's the place where you would put your email.

235
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,460
Right.

236
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,362
So Schoolbrains is the secure data management system

237
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:13,054
for all student information in the district.

238
00:28:14,635 --> 00:28:26,203
And that's really critical because it contains a host of sensitive private information that should not be out there.

239
00:28:27,284 --> 00:28:31,447
It identifies a wealth of information about a student.

240
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:39,372
And so that system communicates with the contact information, the directory data

241
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:56,542
of email, phone numbers, things like parent names, those types of things gets communicated with school messenger, which is then what we push the bulk of our emails, the bulk of our, not the bulk, all of our phone messages come from.

242
00:28:58,216 --> 00:29:02,418
Right, so if a parent is not, exactly what Dr. Cushing said.

243
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:14,304
So if a parent is not receiving an email or robocall from the district, then the first step needs to be working at the school-based level with the secretary to see why.

244
00:29:14,825 --> 00:29:19,747
So if it's that they've changed their phone number, their email, there's a typo.

245
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:26,631
I will say there have been instances in the past where families have maybe knowingly or unknowingly

246
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:34,426
um, you know, marked school emails in like spam or something.

247
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:38,008
And so they directly go there or they're directly removed from their emails.

248
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:50,533
And so there have been a few instances where some of our, um, communication staff here have had to restore, um, so that they will accept again, the school emails.

249
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:52,694
Um, Melanie.

250
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,076
Yeah, thank you.

251
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:56,276
So,

252
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:04,845
Peter, so we didn't get to school brains until middle school, clearly, because the motivation, too, is to check your students' grades, right?

253
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:13,811
So a lot of families won't be motivated necessarily by just going in to change info, but to be able to check the grades is certainly motivating for families, and also to check assignments, what have you.

254
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:21,437
But do I understand correctly that you're saying, Peter, that school brains then converts to school math, not converts, but has a,

255
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:27,539
that's a school messenger, that's the email or no?

256
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:30,700
It is an entirely separate product.

257
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,920
Right, and also isn't school, thank you.

258
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:38,221
And also school messenger also has sort of tiers of accessibility, does it not?

259
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:48,483
Like if I'm not mistaken, some school officials, when you talk about sort of the level of private information, some school officials are able to see like IEP data, 504 data, whatever others are not.

260
00:30:48,523 --> 00:30:52,264
So it all depends on sort of a need to know, is that right or not right?

261
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,091
In school brains, yes.

262
00:30:55,412 --> 00:30:58,173
School messenger does not have any of that information.

263
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:05,878
Right, so it's a tiered database system for a management system on a need-to-know basis as well.

264
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:11,321
So it's a little bit more complicated than just a straight database, right?

265
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:22,087
Yes, so it's with a multi-level relational database and is extraordinarily complicated.

266
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:24,768
Okay.

267
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:46,199
Um, but it sounds like, you know, one of our goals is that all families will have access to school brains so that they can maintain their own contact information so that the district can reach them, you know, via whether it's school messenger or blackboard or robocall.

268
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:52,582
But if the data is not in school brains appropriately or correctly, that

269
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,532
Family is not going to be communicated with as we push out updates.

270
00:31:57,613 --> 00:31:58,834
OK.

271
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:07,379
So I know there are a number of people on the phone who joined us from PTO's and I didn't know if you all had anything you wanted to.

272
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,283
Contribute to the discussion as it relates to like you all as a stakeholder group.

273
00:32:15,864 --> 00:32:18,146
In terms of communications you receive from the.

274
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:26,808
the district or things you hear about or communication needs that you have that sort of fit into this discussion.

275
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:28,188
So I just wanted to.

276
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:36,692
Sort of ask if you all if any of you I see a bunch of faces had anything you wanted to say Kristen.

277
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:39,153
Hello everybody.

278
00:32:41,014 --> 00:32:49,118
I think from a PTO standpoint it would be helpful to us to be able to have some sort of limited access to

279
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:50,987
emails.

280
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:54,429
Right now, our only way to reach people is like, who do you know?

281
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:56,290
Do you have so and so's email?

282
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,012
Are you friends with her on Facebook?

283
00:32:58,272 --> 00:33:08,879
And, you know, and really just through Facebook, which is maybe not the most effective way to reach the most diverse audience and to make everybody feel included.

284
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,542
So it would be helpful if we had some sort of

285
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:20,874
controlled access to emails, not student grades, not anything like that, but that would probably be helpful to us.

286
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:22,535
Which PTO, Kristen?

287
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:24,095
McGlynn Middle.

288
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:40,221
I know that at Brooks, they have a system that they use that does sort of the same things that we're talking about, which is called A2Z Connect.

289
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:47,607
And I believe McGlynn Elementary may be using A to Z as well, but I could be wrong about that.

290
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:52,469
Amanda?

291
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:55,730
Hi.

292
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,391
I saw your little box lighting up.

293
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:01,292
There's all sorts of other noise going on.

294
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:03,432
I was just going to echo what Kristen said.

295
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:11,175
I think especially at the middle school and the high school level, everything changes when she hit middle school, I think, as far as

296
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:13,430
being able to communicate with other families.

297
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:14,971
It's a whole nother world.

298
00:34:16,113 --> 00:34:22,779
You know, I think we've done as good a job as we can at the Brooks using that A to Z directory, but it is super labor intensive.

299
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:32,830
And we just had our school council meeting yesterday and we were talking about, especially in this time of COVID in the, you know, we're not all hanging out on the,

300
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:35,610
playground picking up our kids every day.

301
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:43,334
And so there's a lot of lost connections, especially I think at the younger grades and for any first time parents and first time families.

302
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:58,041
And if there was definitely a way for us to be able to communicate with those families, you know, through just email, I think, you know, we don't need to have all that other information.

303
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:00,302
I don't even feel like we need to necessarily have phone numbers

304
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:03,277
or addresses or anything like that.

305
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:15,990
I think mostly by email, although I do know that, you know, that could limit some contacts for those who maybe don't have continuous, you know, internet connection and whatnot.

306
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:18,913
So that's what I have to say.

307
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:19,594
Thanks, Amanda.

308
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:50,215
Is that, I mean, I think that is something that recurs and certainly at the elementary level, I think the other driver of wanting some sort of platform among parents at the elementary school level is to establish your network of friends as your kids sort of

309
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:59,732
go progress through the grades and they go from having you know three friends in one class they go to another class and they realize like oh there's more than like three friends that I can have and.

310
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:04,376
Their network start to grow and families are trying to be in contact with each other.

311
00:36:05,718 --> 00:36:12,625
Certainly, that is something that I think the brooks Community I think that's why the mcglenn started using it as well, has.

312
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:21,851
appreciated about using A to Z, although it is amazingly labor-intensive for a volunteer organization to maintain that kind of thing.

313
00:36:23,772 --> 00:36:38,060
And then I think what inevitably happens, particularly in the elementary level, is it comes up on a kid's birthday or some reason why you want to reach out to the whole class.

314
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,762
And it has, at times, I think, been really difficult for parents

315
00:36:42,607 --> 00:36:58,755
figure out how to access the right group of families to make sure that if you are intending to include an entire classroom full of children, that you're not relying on your seven-year-old to remember the first and last name of 18 children in your class.

316
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:09,161
So I think at the elementary level, they have this sort of other requirement of how they connect to each other that does change over time and become

317
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:25,565
I guess sort of less important because families make those connections and have ways to sort of get to people that they know when they get to middle school, high school that you don't have when you start out in Medford Public Schools when your children are very young.

318
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:35,253
So I think there, to me, it sounds like there's sort of a need or a requirement for the PTOs to have some level of

319
00:37:36,683 --> 00:37:40,606
way to communicate with this same group of people that Medford Public Schools is communicating with.

320
00:37:41,587 --> 00:38:01,281
And then I think there are, there's like this other question of families having a need or a want to communicate with others and are there tools out there or does our current tool set allow for those kinds of things to happen that we just haven't enabled or are they not possible?

321
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:06,365
Are there tools out there that do make those things possible that sort of integrate

322
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:07,359
in that way.

323
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:12,221
And I don't know if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions on that.

324
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:22,785
I think what you just said brought up two thoughts from me.

325
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:30,247
One is that in my time going through the Medford public schools, I mean, I've been blessed to have Ms.

326
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:35,069
Galussi as a communicator and Mr. Tucci as a communicator, both of whom are fabulous at it.

327
00:38:35,473 --> 00:38:36,833
Not everybody is great at it.

328
00:38:37,974 --> 00:38:48,296
Secondly, the method by which a teacher uses to communicate to families changes year to year.

329
00:38:48,897 --> 00:38:54,898
I've had teachers use Dojo, Blooms and Remind.

330
00:38:55,298 --> 00:39:04,861
So I think it would be beneficial if as a system we decide this is the preferred platform for teachers to communicate

331
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:13,989
to families, because I know for me, when I communicate, I teach first grade, when I communicate to my families, we're asked to use Dojo.

332
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:16,611
So many of the families are already in the system.

333
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:22,317
All I have to do is just click and they're all, I just upload their information from kindergarten.

334
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,201
And thirdly, the use of the app this year has been helpful.

335
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,863
My daughter's in seventh grade and

336
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:34,101
they must have been asked to put the app on their phones at some point.

337
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,242
So a lot of the information goes straight to her.

338
00:39:36,362 --> 00:39:39,784
And she'll say to me, did you get that information about X, Y, and Z?

339
00:39:39,804 --> 00:39:44,828
And I'm like, yes, like, you know, just one more set of eyes out there sifting through information.

340
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:49,511
So the ability to communicate definitely changes as the students grow.

341
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:55,835
And some of the onus shifts from always just the parent to the child.

342
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,276
And that definitely helps kids

343
00:39:58,275 --> 00:40:06,757
who maybe don't have parents who speak English or maybe just don't have parents that have the bandwidth to stay in touch all the time.

344
00:40:07,097 --> 00:40:12,959
And when the children can do that, we are able, it's just one more point of connection that we can reach.

345
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,660
So just something to consider.

346
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Thanks.

347
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:21,081
I'll be out in a minute.

348
00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:31,603
Sorry guys.

349
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:41,966
Okay, so I think those, I think those sort of get to like special requirements and stakeholder groups.

350
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:57,090
Are there other things around comments from our various stakeholder groups that we should talk about before we move on to where our technology might be able to intersect with some of these requirements?

351
00:40:59,586 --> 00:40:59,906
Lisa?

352
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,289
Oh, we can't hear you, Lisa.

353
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:05,170
Can you not unmute?

354
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:07,812
Well, that would be helpful.

355
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:09,032
There you are.

356
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:18,418
No, I'm just saying, I do not have children, but I can see my sister who has twins, and she works full time, and her husband works full time.

357
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:24,102
So if you're all on the computer, what emails do you open?

358
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:28,045
If the kids came home and said, well, we're doing this tomorrow, Mom.

359
00:41:29,606 --> 00:41:34,569
she may not open the email, which might have further information about tomorrow because the kids mentioned it.

360
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:50,218
I just think that having worked in the city for so long, we went from people calling you on the phone when they had a question to now they potentially email or sometimes they even text you if they have that capability.

361
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,760
But do people check as much as

362
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:59,868
they can in, you know, living, living life.

363
00:41:59,928 --> 00:42:04,168
And I think that's, you know, you tend to check when you're looking for a specific thing.

364
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:05,749
But I'm not, I don't know.

365
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:10,290
I mean, I don't know if everybody checks a, their emails daily, do they have the time?

366
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:14,950
Or, you know, is that is it helpful sending emails?

367
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,891
Or is it helpful sending the school messenger?

368
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:21,592
You know, like, what, what do people definitely check?

369
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,352
I guess would be my question.

370
00:42:27,305 --> 00:42:30,627
And I think the answer is, it depends who you are.

371
00:42:30,707 --> 00:42:39,573
Like, and I think that's, you know, I think when you talk about reaching people, talking about preferences makes a huge difference.

372
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:54,583
So, you know, in a full, like if you were looking at sort of a full scale communications operation, you would know that Melanie prefers a text and Kristen prefers an email and Jenny prefers a robocall or, or

373
00:42:55,738 --> 00:42:57,219
know, and Kathy wants all three.

374
00:42:57,239 --> 00:42:58,920
You know what I mean?

375
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:09,205
Like you would have the ability to say this is how this person wants to be communicated with and then channel those communications to the place where it's going to reach them the fastest.

376
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:11,727
I don't know if our systems have that capability.

377
00:43:11,887 --> 00:43:13,488
Like the city's new system because

378
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,321
I probably didn't check off anything.

379
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:20,984
And so I get it everywhere in my house, my cell phone, you know, even on my work phone.

380
00:43:21,044 --> 00:43:21,264
So.

381
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:24,426
So, yeah, that's what that's what I mean.

382
00:43:24,466 --> 00:43:27,548
I mean, there's something like we have to get to that point.

383
00:43:27,848 --> 00:43:29,510
Where will people always go?

384
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,610
Right.

385
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:35,213
And I think that's as you said, it's very individualized.

386
00:43:36,054 --> 00:43:38,215
So I Melanie point.

387
00:43:38,514 --> 00:43:40,295
Yeah, I mean, I really appreciate that, Jenny.

388
00:43:40,315 --> 00:43:42,315
I think that's critical.

389
00:43:43,396 --> 00:43:46,377
Perfect example, Monday, Burlington School was called off.

390
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:48,277
My daughter's not a district placement in Burlington.

391
00:43:48,797 --> 00:43:49,858
The van came and got her.

392
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:50,838
She went up there.

393
00:43:50,898 --> 00:43:52,258
We didn't know school was called off.

394
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,419
We didn't get them.

395
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:58,100
It was an email that was buried because we're so inundated with emails.

396
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,221
There was no robocall.

397
00:43:59,241 --> 00:43:59,921
There was no text.

398
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:02,682
And text is the way, like I tell people all the time, if you have to reach me,

399
00:44:03,262 --> 00:44:04,302
Text is the way to reach me.

400
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:05,203
I have my phone with me.

401
00:44:05,303 --> 00:44:18,228
It pops up I see it might not be able to get back to it right away, but I see it emails I have like four different emails for all different occasions and it just email has gotten to be so overwhelming and I see that with the kids as well like

402
00:44:18,761 --> 00:44:23,443
This generation, the students in particular, they are not an email generation.

403
00:44:23,503 --> 00:44:25,924
It's almost like trying to call them on the telephone.

404
00:44:26,365 --> 00:44:32,368
When I first got a babysitter, and I would call the babysitter all the time, and this babysitter never responds to me.

405
00:44:32,988 --> 00:44:34,509
And finally, somebody was like, text them.

406
00:44:34,689 --> 00:44:37,790
And I had no sooner sent the text that it would be responded to.

407
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:39,271
And it's the same.

408
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:45,374
Don't email a high school student if you really expect to get an answer from them anytime soon, because it's just not going to happen.

409
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:51,184
I'm sliding more and more into that because it's the immediacy of like all of the demands that we have on us.

410
00:44:51,684 --> 00:44:57,046
So I really, you know, agree, Jenny, that, you know, there has to be a choice of what those are.

411
00:44:57,566 --> 00:45:01,627
And then when the, and also I think that there has to be a tiered level of communication.

412
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:05,769
So clearly when there's something as important as there is no school, right?

413
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:12,291
Like we have caught, you know, that needs to be like probably every communication channel you have, whether they said they preferred this or not.

414
00:45:12,795 --> 00:45:15,556
like, you know, do every blast them from every way that you can.

415
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:24,978
So I think that there's gonna be tiers within that as well, but, you know, God, it would be so great to have a system where we could choose what our preference was and that there was some way to funnel it.

416
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:26,858
Peter?

417
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:31,779
So I just wanna respond to what Kristen mentioned about ClassDojo and Remind 101.

418
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:33,739
Those are really great tools.

419
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,300
We are signatories to the Student Data Privacy Consortium.

420
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,181
And so while I believe that those two are

421
00:45:41,815 --> 00:45:52,644
Any tools that we use for communication that access student or family data must fall within these, the parameters established by the Student Data Privacy Consortium.

422
00:45:52,764 --> 00:45:53,284
That's first.

423
00:45:54,365 --> 00:45:54,665
Second,

424
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,146
There is a product out there that would replace School Messenger.

425
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:02,667
It's called Blackboard.

426
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,308
It's also, it's the same people behind the application.

427
00:46:06,768 --> 00:46:14,510
We were, as a district, it's a better product and it's fiscally a little bit better as well.

428
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,791
So we were going to move to that this summer.

429
00:46:19,792 --> 00:46:24,713
We put that on hold because of the whole COVID situation,

430
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:28,894
And it's a pretty dramatic change, to be honest.

431
00:46:29,355 --> 00:46:36,589
And the last thing that I or anyone else wanted to do was to upset anything with our communications at such a critical time.

432
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:58,649
So the Blackboard platform has a more powerful linkage to Facebook, to text messages, for people to select how they wanna get it, but for us to be able to push, I think in a much more efficient manner, the messages that we need to push.

433
00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:02,411
So we'll probably make that shift this coming summer.

434
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:13,149
We'll look at what School Messenger offers as upgrades and things like that, but we'll probably look to make that shift this summer.

435
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:18,211
And it allows us a little bit more flexibility.

436
00:47:18,311 --> 00:47:29,475
I also don't see a reason why PTOs working with school principals can't use our broadcast email functionality.

437
00:47:31,003 --> 00:47:35,465
to put messages out through school messenger at this time.

438
00:47:36,205 --> 00:47:47,868
Like, but that would be a partnership between the principals and the PTO, like when important stuff is coming up or to do certain things along those lines to help support their work.

439
00:47:48,288 --> 00:47:56,830
And then it would maintain people's privacy of information because it's not being handed out to a third party.

440
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,611
That would be my only concern is

441
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:07,594
Like we hold the information as the agency that it's given to and that authorization piece to give it out.

442
00:48:07,994 --> 00:48:25,277
So, but if we're delivering a message, we're not violating what some people might see as that sacred trust of their personal information, even for something as generic as your email or your phone number or things along those lines.

443
00:48:27,035 --> 00:48:41,284
Yeah, and I think the question about the PTOs is that there can be a tremendous amount of activity that falls into the bucket of like not the most important thing a principal needs to do in a day.

444
00:48:42,245 --> 00:48:50,770
That is really important to the school community, but it's like the last thing the principal should be spending time pushing out.

445
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:54,873
Like, you know, hey, this fundraiser is about to close and this is your last chance.

446
00:48:55,673 --> 00:49:19,835
You know, those are the kinds of things that, you know, I think PTOs would feel bad asking school administrators to participate in in that way, if there was another way for us to preserve the sort of security aspect, but also enable them to be their own agents in that way.

447
00:49:20,735 --> 00:49:22,317
And so perhaps as we look at

448
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:33,648
messenger and blackboard there's an opportunity to say are there ways to grant like junior level access to certain folks who can push out emails on behalf of PTOs and things like that.

449
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:51,542
That may be a good way to to try to get at some of this without allowing people access to to data and I think you know one ways one of the ways A to Z does that is you sort of have the option to say

450
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,953
what kind of communications that you want.

451
00:49:54,433 --> 00:50:06,136
And if you don't want any communications from the PTO, for example, like you just say, I don't, I'm willing to put like my name in there as though my child is in this classroom, but I don't want any communications.

452
00:50:06,176 --> 00:50:13,057
And then there's no access to that data based on what the parent has opted in for.

453
00:50:13,217 --> 00:50:15,818
It's like, you have to say it's okay, or it's not.

454
00:50:16,758 --> 00:50:19,399
So that might be something that Blackboard

455
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:25,697
or even school messenger could do for us if we are able to get to looking at that kind of upgrade this coming summer.

456
00:50:26,915 --> 00:50:29,677
And I just wanted to jump in as well.

457
00:50:29,757 --> 00:50:52,293
As I was thinking about the different platforms and what was shared with Dojo and Talking Points and the different platforms that my daughter's teacher, I think it was Dojo last year, this year it's Talking Points where it's like a generic, their cell phone number is kind of kept private, but

458
00:50:53,013 --> 00:51:00,378
It's you download this particular app, and then they respond and communicate, and it keeps track of communication.

459
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:08,142
So I know that people have to pick what they feel works for them at that given time, but the point is to try to improve communications.

460
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:20,730
But what I like about the idea of an A to Z is as a parent, I get an incredible amount of communications that come to me.

461
00:51:23,197 --> 00:51:38,302
where I'm getting text messages constantly, things that are not maybe relevant to my particular needs, but a lot of text messages, a lot of emails, and trying to sift between that, that it can sometimes become overwhelming.

462
00:51:38,982 --> 00:51:42,143
And so right now, in particular,

463
00:51:43,383 --> 00:51:54,767
to what Mr. Murphy had said earlier, so much of the communication that is going out right now is specific to how we're handling or things that are going on with the pandemic.

464
00:51:55,147 --> 00:52:02,710
So some families will prioritize that communication and then let's say there is

465
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:15,604
an online opportunity for an online raffle or something like that, that they could say, well, I'm not, I don't want to get four reminders about a reminder.

466
00:52:16,546 --> 00:52:39,513
So I'm thinking maybe a happy medium would either be to try to ask parents for some type of a release, whether it was an A to Z or something like that, where you were explaining parents have the option to say, I'd like to be told about special events, but not about

467
00:52:40,620 --> 00:53:00,636
you know, they could pick and choose the types of communications that they want to receive because it may end up, you know, especially if you have more than one child in multiple schools, it could truly end up being, you know, too much communication and they end up missing to the point that Ms.

468
00:53:00,696 --> 00:53:09,483
Member McLaughlin shared, missing one important announcement that school was closed because you have 15 other emails coming in and you're looking at,

469
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:17,588
You look at 14 of the 15 of them, and the 15th one is the one that you missed that you should have read.

470
00:53:18,089 --> 00:53:25,654
So I almost feel like trying to find out how much is enough communication?

471
00:53:26,314 --> 00:53:28,956
What modality works?

472
00:53:29,216 --> 00:53:36,261
Some people communicate frequently in little blurbs, some email, some do lengthier communications.

473
00:53:36,682 --> 00:53:37,862
Should it be a newsletter?

474
00:53:39,496 --> 00:53:48,523
you know, do people like talking points or dojo or, you know, some kind of classroom communication.

475
00:53:48,543 --> 00:54:03,374
And I know for some of our EL teachers, it's slipping my mind right now, but there is a platform that our EL teachers use to communicate with the English learner families.

476
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,396
It's the talking points, talking points.

477
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:33,959
yeah so talking points as well i know i couldn't remember if it was that platform but i know it translates and so that's the one that they uh the talking points i guess they um can translate and so you know would that be the one to say to the entire district everyone switch to talking points or if a particular teacher loves dojo and that works for him or her so it's

478
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:50,052
trying to foster and wanting to encourage greater communication at all levels, but at the same time trying to give people the opportunity to be able to use a modality that works best for them.

479
00:54:50,672 --> 00:54:55,936
So I just wanted to put that out there as another consideration.

480
00:54:58,218 --> 00:54:59,679
Yeah, I like that a lot.

481
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:00,420
Claire?

482
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:02,885
Hi, good evening.

483
00:55:03,546 --> 00:55:20,053
I wanted to just put in an idea I completely agree superintendent about the overload that could the potential overload that all groups using this all groups associated with the school at different levels all using the same platform.

484
00:55:20,709 --> 00:55:31,383
It sounds idyllic in a way that we could all be harmoniously living in the world, digital world, the same one to save data but you're right, it could cause chaos.

485
00:55:32,785 --> 00:55:36,069
But it occurs to me that one strategy might be

486
00:55:37,891 --> 00:55:41,372
So I have a website for my business.

487
00:55:41,532 --> 00:55:50,274
And one of the things that I pay for as part of the business is I get an allotment of free email campaigns.

488
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:52,055
And I had just done that today.

489
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:57,936
And I can see it on this little dial of how much I've used of whatever I have until I have to start paying for it.

490
00:55:58,497 --> 00:56:03,458
And it occurred to me that an option for if we're all going to be using the same system might be that the PTOs get

491
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:09,645
three messages a month, or whatever we want to set what it is.

492
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:18,748
And then it's up to the PTOs to be judicious with our communications and to be really mindful about a schedule.

493
00:56:18,988 --> 00:56:26,571
And I think that's one of the things that PTOs, well-run and well-managed PTOs can do, can schedule.

494
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:35,636
when we want the news to go out, when we want the reminders to go out, so that we don't overload the system, but that we could still share in a system.

495
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:55,148
So I have no other further ideas of what system to use and how to regulate it, but I just thought it might be an idea of if that's one of the options, I think as a PTO president, I think it would be completely fair and reasonable to say, you can use this platform, but you only get this many communications.

496
00:56:55,608 --> 00:56:57,569
So be thoughtful about that.

497
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:04,010
I love that suggestion of knowing that it's a set amount.

498
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:23,015
But I'm just wondering if we said PTOs have three allotments a month, and some teachers are sending out one or two communications, or maybe an email or a text message, depending which one they're using.

499
00:57:25,604 --> 00:57:39,693
what, you know, and what do people prefer to the conversation that was said earlier, when member McLaughlin said she was calling, nobody answers the phone right now, but at the text message, you'll eventually get to it or you'll see it and you'll respond.

500
00:57:41,114 --> 00:57:43,336
What modality do the parents prefer?

501
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:46,338
So that, that is something as well.

502
00:57:47,127 --> 00:58:01,953
I think I wonder if in processing what modality people would prefer, I think of an important data piece is the types of information that we're wanting to push out, right?

503
00:58:01,993 --> 00:58:06,634
So is this an all-schools, all-children communication?

504
00:58:08,115 --> 00:58:22,402
you know, a PTO event that is open to all grades, right, and that that's a larger piece of communication versus a Mrs. Mastoni Columbus classroom thing.

505
00:58:22,782 --> 00:58:24,343
It might not be the same system.

506
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,284
So I've had a bunch of teachers who've used

507
00:58:26,764 --> 00:58:49,218
you know, Blooms, who've used Message Me, I think that's what it was, and that was a very class-specific, and that was a lot of communications, but it was very class-specific, and it became a different pattern of putting that class hat on versus the app, say, the Mustang app, which when I get those alerts,

508
00:58:49,898 --> 00:58:58,943
I've already trained myself that that is the district wide or principal sanctioned should pick up a notice.

509
00:58:59,223 --> 00:59:17,593
And so in thinking about which ones we're gonna choose, a little bit of a seriousness of the message and the large groupness of the message may help us sort through where we go and what we choose to do and the size of the audience for each message type.

510
00:59:20,187 --> 00:59:32,496
Yeah, and I think having a system that allows some flexibility so that as those types of communications change over time, they are easy enough to change in the system.

511
00:59:32,636 --> 00:59:36,799
They're easy for people to change their mind about.

512
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:46,906
I'm always sensitive to systems that require somebody to reach the assistant superintendent in order to make a change to their preferences.

513
00:59:46,946 --> 00:59:49,888
Those kinds of things concern me because I think that's where

514
00:59:51,366 --> 00:59:53,787
become non systemic and they start to fall apart.

515
00:59:53,887 --> 01:00:00,929
So when we talk about what we want the applications to be able to do for us, those would be things.

516
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:04,630
Those would be things that I would want to see us be able to do.

517
01:00:05,911 --> 01:00:08,392
I see Kristen has her hand in the air.

518
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:12,273
Hi, sorry to be a pest.

519
01:00:12,453 --> 01:00:17,855
I was just thinking though, you know when we're discussing sifting through information, this is maybe.

520
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:30,566
A suggestion, I'm no communications expert by any means, but like for Lisa, when she's releasing her information, I get most of her information through let's say Facebook.

521
01:00:31,826 --> 01:00:36,448
If when releasing certain types of information, maybe we use different graphics.

522
01:00:38,311 --> 01:00:44,275
a certain set type of graphic that each time I see it, I know it means school committee meeting.

523
01:00:45,717 --> 01:01:02,189
That will catch my eye and I'll be able to visually decide if that's something I wanna click on and read more about, or if it's something Columbus specific, or if it's a community event, or if it's something like that, that using a specific graphic might be a way to filter what applies to me.

524
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,311
Just a thought, I'll stop now.

525
01:01:10,643 --> 01:01:10,883
Alani?

526
01:01:12,904 --> 01:01:23,628
Yeah, I really like the idea of visuals, Kristen, because they're universal and I think that they, you know, I'm a visual learner and I think that they translate, right?

527
01:01:23,648 --> 01:01:25,029
We don't have to worry about a lot of that.

528
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:26,670
So I think that's a really great idea.

529
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:30,691
But I also think that consistency across the district is really critical.

530
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:38,815
So this is where I really ran into trouble when the kids started to go, you know, we have three children, so they started to go to different schools and every school had different

531
01:01:40,014 --> 01:01:40,735
uh, modalities.

532
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:43,457
And then every teacher within the school had different modalities.

533
01:01:43,597 --> 01:02:06,612
And so you're trying to figure out, I was constantly paying catch up on wall, which teacher is actually doing which modality, you know, and that's why it was so critical this year when we were looking at, you know, the pandemic, when we were deciding on remote, what we were using, was it Google classroom, was it zoom, whatever, like that we were, had this consistency across the board because if parents, as we all know, have multiple children,

534
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,975
have to figure out the five different modalities, it's just not going to work.

535
01:02:10,275 --> 01:02:11,958
So we need consistency.

536
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:20,934
So I think we really need to involve obviously the teachers and the union in this decision for whatever we end up deciding, but they need to have input.

537
01:02:21,254 --> 01:02:29,555
I do know earlier when you guys were talking about talking points, we've got a ton of feedback from EL teachers and families that they love talking points.

538
01:02:29,595 --> 01:02:30,396
So that's good to know.

539
01:02:30,436 --> 01:02:37,337
But I think it would be good to know from staff what are the modalities that they do like and then sort of going from there.

540
01:02:37,377 --> 01:02:42,098
But one or two in a very consistent way across the district, I think has to be.

541
01:02:42,898 --> 01:02:43,458
the way we go.

542
01:02:43,478 --> 01:02:46,179
Agreed.

543
01:02:47,579 --> 01:03:10,864
The other thing that we had on our agenda as a stakeholder group were some of our subgroups of students, particularly our English language learners, but also our families where the parents may not speak English, but the children speak English, or they used to be in our EL program and they've since sort of

544
01:03:12,396 --> 01:03:18,281
assimilated into the Gen Ed space, but there may not be complete fluency at home.

545
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:35,535
So I think the other thing or the other concern that I have is about those folks, you know, not showing up to the Zoom call to tell us what they need from communication and whether we're like meeting their requirements or not.

546
01:03:37,116 --> 01:03:41,480
And I think that's sort of a conversation we have a lot and often

547
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:44,091
in various ways.

548
01:03:44,151 --> 01:04:08,132
I know we talked a lot about it during the task force on communication over the summer, but I did hear, I heard from a teacher recently who was saying like, there's all this communications going out, but there is a population of families who still don't completely know what they've chosen or if they still have a choice

549
01:04:09,048 --> 01:04:19,474
or if they can make a change or what, you know, sort of what this, what this means, you know, as, as, you know, the pandemic continues to unfold.

550
01:04:20,075 --> 01:04:35,664
So I think for some of our subgroups, I think I worry the most about are they like receiving and able and are being able to engage with the communications that we're sending, even though we are translating, which I think is,

551
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:45,141
a huge step forward in something that only happened sort of sporadically in the past, but now it's happening with some consistency, which is amazing.

552
01:04:45,161 --> 01:04:59,486
I don't feel like, I think we have great strategies to know whether we're reaching people in a way that's meaningful so that they are able to engage with the content.

553
01:04:59,506 --> 01:05:05,188
And I don't know if there's necessarily a technology component or a fix to that,

554
01:05:06,127 --> 01:05:23,964
or not, but I wanted to throw that out there because even though I don't believe there's a tremendous number of people on the phone that can sort of represent that subgroup, I think they are important to make sure we're thinking about.

555
01:05:23,984 --> 01:05:28,728
Member McLaughlin's hand is up, I was gonna jump in.

556
01:05:28,748 --> 01:05:30,970
So sorry, let me yield to Member McLaughlin.

557
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,316
Thank you, superintendent.

558
01:05:34,336 --> 01:05:37,078
That's very nice of you.

559
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:40,841
I was just going to say, yeah, there's a number of subgroups that are concerning.

560
01:05:40,881 --> 01:05:42,002
And so I would agree.

561
01:05:42,062 --> 01:05:55,152
And I think we need to, I think that's, you know, almost its own, you know, subcommittee or subset of a subcommittee to think about how we're going into the community, because I don't think necessarily those subgroups are going to come to us.

562
01:05:55,232 --> 01:05:58,795
We need to seek them out or find community leaders who will help us seek them out.

563
01:05:59,236 --> 01:06:00,537
But I also think to that end,

564
01:06:02,307 --> 01:06:07,611
I know that Joan Bowen has been working more also with out-of-district families.

565
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:10,393
So, you know, that's a big component as well.

566
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:16,297
Those, you know, families are, and they have, you know, are entirely entitled to the life of the school for their child.

567
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:18,899
They are still Medford public school students.

568
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:22,581
But also just to that end, like whether or not they in fact have

569
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:25,023
School email addresses.

570
01:06:25,544 --> 01:06:26,505
So that was interesting.

571
01:06:26,545 --> 01:06:31,090
We just had a bounce back on a school email Joan just FYI And I thought well, that's weird.

572
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:41,000
I don't know if you know, she fell off the roster But so that's a point to consider but also just yeah like and then I think again to that end superintendent our

573
01:06:42,742 --> 01:06:58,337
our students who are in foster care, our students who are homeless students, right, those fluid students that are coming in and out, and how we are, especially if we have families that we know are consistently fostering children within the district, that we're really, you know, enabling those relationships and making it easy for them to get

574
01:06:59,768 --> 01:07:02,151
different foster children's information changed or whatever.

575
01:07:02,191 --> 01:07:16,949
So I think it'd be really, really helpful to have a group, even a very small group that represents, you know, that diversity, you know, the BIPOC diversity and the socioeconomic diversity and the ability diversity.

576
01:07:17,924 --> 01:07:21,967
so that those people could tell us what is really helpful for them.

577
01:07:22,628 --> 01:07:32,155
And certainly, I think we have different constituents in the community that can help identify some of those community leaders that maybe that can speak to some of those issues.

578
01:07:36,658 --> 01:07:41,102
In responding to what you just shared, Member McLaughlin, I would say that

579
01:07:44,005 --> 01:07:55,616
that's like that level of communication, like grassroots, it's like the next level, which I think is something we definitely should be shooting for.

580
01:07:57,037 --> 01:08:06,606
I know where our English learner families are, we communicate frequently with Mr. Paul Teixeira for his

581
01:08:09,581 --> 01:08:16,830
teachers and staff where a level one and level two students who are newcomers are newcomers.

582
01:08:19,187 --> 01:08:24,309
Those teachers are communicating frequently with the families.

583
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:35,474
I was in a classroom on Monday, and if need be, some of the teachers will transition.

584
01:08:35,514 --> 01:08:47,419
If they're bilingual, they'll say something again in the other language and have the students respond back and do the reverse translation, which happened on Monday in one of the classrooms that I was in.

585
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:57,747
And so the students at that point in time were able to understand exactly what was being said as they are still acquiring the language.

586
01:08:58,268 --> 01:09:04,333
You do definitely need to have those additional steps in place.

587
01:09:04,893 --> 01:09:17,044
And so I know we're not there yet, but eventually to be able to have greater translation available or greater visuals available to the suggestion of

588
01:09:17,564 --> 01:09:24,830
what type of a communication is it so people kind of know when I see the Mustang here, this is what it means.

589
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:39,422
When I see the Mustang on the left side, this is what it means to come up with some kind of visual image or symbol so that it will help to facilitate and promote greater communication.

590
01:09:39,502 --> 01:09:40,643
So I think that that is

591
01:09:43,468 --> 01:09:54,392
To remember Graham's point about right now, anything that's going out from central office from my office or from the schools should be going out in the four languages.

592
01:09:54,992 --> 01:09:59,714
That is what we are trying to do every time that we're sending communication out.

593
01:10:00,254 --> 01:10:04,520
to make sure that that is consistent and everyone knows that that's happening.

594
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:16,117
So there are some details where it wasn't being done as consistently, but to be able to say, okay, we can't have 15 languages, but we're going to at least have these four every single time we send something out.

595
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:23,135
And trying to at least commit to translating it four times.

596
01:10:23,276 --> 01:10:38,528
We're not yet at that level where we can have translation available in all of those key languages at this point in time, but trying to create either those opportunities or specific opportunities to target

597
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:56,262
different populations and thinking back to the summer when we did do the roundtables and we had significant community community involvement and participation and we did have the translators available, but even with the translators being available.

598
01:10:59,108 --> 01:11:03,891
Some people stated their work schedule, the timing, they couldn't make that particular time.

599
01:11:04,651 --> 01:11:20,880
But again, just when those opportunities happen, to continue to say we're going to have this as a possibility or an available resource to you and hopefully be able to have it catch on so that if they can't attend, maybe they'll ask a designee to attend.

600
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:24,522
who will be able to get the information back to the families.

601
01:11:25,222 --> 01:11:41,754
So I think we just have to keep working at those types of situations and finding ways to just keep communicating on the multiple levels so that we're reaching, you know, trying our best to reach 100% of the community.

602
01:11:42,815 --> 01:11:43,155
Thank you.

603
01:11:44,056 --> 01:11:44,376
Joan?

604
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:47,728
Yes, I just wanted to piggyback on that a little bit.

605
01:11:47,788 --> 01:12:02,057
So for our EL students that are also identified as student with disabilities, we have a conversation with the parents, with an interpreter and how they want to have their documents translated or interpreted for them.

606
01:12:02,537 --> 01:12:09,501
And I think that's also important for our EL families to look at how do they want communications provided to them?

607
01:12:09,601 --> 01:12:10,982
Do they prefer email?

608
01:12:11,022 --> 01:12:11,742
Do they prefer

609
01:12:13,503 --> 01:12:19,845
a phone call or a text message or something like that, because we're looking, we're assuming that everyone's going to read an email.

610
01:12:20,286 --> 01:12:25,507
And like we said, people have problems with bandwidth, or maybe they don't have access to a computer that easily.

611
01:12:25,988 --> 01:12:33,570
But finding out from the families how they want to be communicated with and what method would work best for them.

612
01:12:33,991 --> 01:12:40,653
I know that could be a big undertaking, but we found it's really worked well for the special education department that

613
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,901
They don't need an interpreter.

614
01:12:43,061 --> 01:12:48,284
We could send them a translated document and somebody can read it to them or whatever it may be.

615
01:12:48,324 --> 01:12:54,127
But it's just something where we want to talk about how we want to be communicated via email, cell phone.

616
01:12:54,467 --> 01:12:58,229
We might want to take that into consideration for our EL families as well.

617
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:09,075
Yeah, I would like to make sure that when we're looking at what Blackboard or any system can do for us, that it can also help us identify

618
01:13:09,736 --> 01:13:15,101
I need translation services and what is that preference?

619
01:13:16,482 --> 01:13:23,488
Because I think, like you said, something like that on an individualized level is very labor intensive.

620
01:13:23,528 --> 01:13:37,480
And we just frankly, we don't have a communications department that has the bandwidth to do this sort of in that like manual way, but that is where technology can help us start to collect this information

621
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:42,098
start to understand what those requests are so that we can start to meet them.

622
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:50,769
The other question I had, when you're doing video, Dr. Edward-Vinson, are there translations happening on the video?

623
01:13:53,612 --> 01:13:54,293
Oh, you're still on mute.

624
01:13:54,645 --> 01:14:01,290
sorry, at the TV studio, they don't have that capability yet at this point in time.

625
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:10,216
It's a specific, I don't know if it's a software or something that works with the TV studio capabilities.

626
01:14:10,897 --> 01:14:22,024
So I think closed captioning might be able to happen for some of the TVs, but to be able to translate into the multiple languages is like a special,

627
01:14:23,145 --> 01:14:26,248
additional programming or software.

628
01:14:26,568 --> 01:14:31,712
So they do not have that capability at the TV studio at this point in time.

629
01:14:31,832 --> 01:14:44,081
So there is an organization called Rev.com and once you have a video you can send it to them and they can subtitle it for you.

630
01:14:44,702 --> 01:14:46,303
And so you send it off to them

631
01:14:46,948 --> 01:14:50,291
They do the subtitling, and it's very inexpensive.

632
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,814
It's like a 24-hour turnaround or something like that.

633
01:14:55,516 --> 01:15:09,989
And when I've done it, I think the English subtitles are free, which helps for those who are hearing impaired, or maybe I don't want to listen to a video out loud for some reason or another.

634
01:15:10,029 --> 01:15:11,470
I'm on a train or whatever, right?

635
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:39,291
back in regular times when people wrote to train places, but it also allows you to say, I want this translated in Spanish and Arabic, you know, whatever it is, and you send it off, they send back files with those closed captions right in the file so that if you're going to post it, I know if you're going to post it to Facebook, you can post it in a way that it's a video, like one video, and all of those things are implicit in the one video.

636
01:15:41,282 --> 01:15:45,525
you just have to post it the right way, but then you could also post them as separate files.

637
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:54,912
I just know every time I've done it, I've been surprised at how affordable it is to translate a video.

638
01:15:54,932 --> 01:16:04,419
I mean, typically a relatively short video, but I don't think it would be like a backbreaking budget expense to be able to do that.

639
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:08,503
And that may get some different traction than you're able to get today.

640
01:16:10,049 --> 01:16:12,883
That may be something worth looking into as well.

641
01:16:13,843 --> 01:16:16,725
I wouldn't have a problem definitely looking into it.

642
01:16:16,845 --> 01:16:41,243
I know that when I do the commercials, I try to keep them very brief working with the TV studio department, but once it's done, even if it's like, you know, two to three minutes, the time for them to upload and, you know, if you mention a website, there are storyboards, there are things that have to be, you know, entered and uploaded.

643
01:16:42,043 --> 01:16:42,844
On their side.

644
01:16:42,944 --> 01:16:47,267
So normally it's about a two hour turnaround, and that's in English.

645
01:16:47,287 --> 01:16:49,789
So I'm wondering.

646
01:16:52,906 --> 01:17:01,811
what probably would end up happening is if something was done and if we were using a Rev.com, there would be a delay.

647
01:17:01,972 --> 01:17:19,143
It would be, once we get the additional languages, we'd have to send it back to the TV studio so that Patrick Gordon or Cat or anyone else who works with him would be able to, I guess,

648
01:17:21,067 --> 01:17:22,949
whatever it is reposted or whatever, yeah.

649
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:28,434
To be able to have it posted when it's playing on a TV channel.

650
01:17:29,675 --> 01:17:40,046
And I just don't know if that, would it, I don't know the level of complexity once it's available in English.

651
01:17:41,653 --> 01:18:08,999
them to be able to go back like would that be another two hours per language um or is it something that would just be you know a push of a button and it was just two minutes so i'm not i'm not sure but i can definitely you know look into that sure ask um what you know how would that work i will um i will send you the information that i have to pass along um and it may be that um

652
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:14,034
you know, we can post to social media easily in that format.

653
01:18:14,075 --> 01:18:18,599
And it takes a little bit of a lag or something to post it to the TV channel.

654
01:18:18,659 --> 01:18:19,080
I don't know.

655
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:27,548
So I can send you the information along with what I have done in the past, just as like a frame of reference.

656
01:18:27,608 --> 01:18:31,012
And then if there's a way for us to integrate that, I think that would be really helpful.

657
01:18:34,378 --> 01:18:48,453
We are a few minutes from the end of the meeting and one of the things that I think we've talked a little bit about are some of our subgroups and spending some time thinking about those subgroups in particular.

658
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:53,839
And I think Melanie said that could be a meeting unto itself and I tend to agree.

659
01:18:55,453 --> 01:18:59,435
We do not have an agenda topic yet for our April meeting.

660
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:12,942
So my thought is that we slot that into our April meeting, which gives us ample time to make sure that we can reach out into the community, figure out how to engage the right folks in that conversation.

661
01:19:13,002 --> 01:19:20,846
But I can put that on the agenda for the April meeting, which is the next meeting where we don't yet have a topic because we will run out of time today.

662
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:22,307
And I don't think we have like

663
01:19:22,682 --> 01:19:24,403
perfect audience for that conversation.

664
01:19:24,524 --> 01:19:26,685
So does that work, Melanie?

665
01:19:27,826 --> 01:19:28,627
Yeah, that's a great idea.

666
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:29,848
What's the date on that, Jenny?

667
01:19:30,589 --> 01:19:31,189
April 6th.

668
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:32,570
April 6th.

669
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:33,771
So it would be, yeah.

670
01:19:33,871 --> 01:19:36,494
And then I'd love to work with creating a flyer.

671
01:19:36,754 --> 01:19:39,416
Again, we could do different languages.

672
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:45,441
Superintendent, maybe you could be mentioning that in some of the commercials, what have you.

673
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:47,763
But I'm assuming you also speak

674
01:19:48,457 --> 01:19:50,520
Haitian Creole, is that accurate?

675
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:52,862
I definitely can speak it.

676
01:19:53,523 --> 01:19:56,666
If you were Haitian Creole, you probably would be laughing.

677
01:19:56,686 --> 01:20:00,330
Oh, all right.

678
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:01,171
Well, that's different.

679
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:03,374
But am I understandable?

680
01:20:03,434 --> 01:20:03,734
Yes.

681
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:05,356
That's good to know.

682
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:15,380
Yeah, so I mean, I think sometimes it's worth sort of doing, you know, a little bit of that too, just to, you know, I think, you know, thinking about, again, Bowman and Diehl, the symbolic frame, right?

683
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:18,781
Like what, letting people know that you really are reaching out and trying to do this.

684
01:20:18,841 --> 01:20:27,484
And I think also just to that end, for member Graham, you know, a few years ago, we were tasked with really, you know, tripling the size.

685
01:20:27,504 --> 01:20:34,026
Our goal was to triple the size of the Medford CPAC, specifically with participation around English learners.

686
01:20:34,665 --> 01:20:36,166
And we achieved that goal.

687
01:20:36,306 --> 01:20:41,511
And a huge, huge part of the way that we did that was just building those one-to-one relationships.

688
01:20:42,011 --> 01:20:50,938
So literally having, you know, five of your people tasked with you contact three people and go have coffee with them and meet with them and whatever, you know.

689
01:20:51,258 --> 01:20:58,124
And then, you know, they tell two friends, then you ask them, can you meet two people, whatever, that old commercial, we told two friends, two friends, two friends.

690
01:20:59,346 --> 01:21:02,527
that we're dating ourselves now, but whatever that was, that BRAC or something.

691
01:21:03,527 --> 01:21:05,647
But anyway, so I think that that would be great.

692
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:06,808
I'm all on board with that.

693
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:07,288
Thank you.

694
01:21:11,069 --> 01:21:20,310
So I think just to recap, we sort of talked about a lot of different, I'll say like goals, requirements, et cetera.

695
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:22,431
And it seems like the time is right.

696
01:21:22,771 --> 01:21:27,412
And perhaps in these minutes, we can sort of crystallize what they are.

697
01:21:29,441 --> 01:21:40,165
so that when we think about a full implementation of Blackboard or any other, whether it's Blackboard or it's not, we know what those requirements are.

698
01:21:40,845 --> 01:21:57,591
And so when we're implementing, we can be thoughtful about making sure those requirements can be implemented as we implement versus sort of, you know, what always happens is you implement and then you say, oh, well, we forgot this thing and now it's too hard to go back and fix because we weren't thinking about that architecture at the time.

699
01:21:58,833 --> 01:22:19,948
The other thing that we didn't talk about that was on my mind is whether, and it sounds like it might, like a Blackboard-style technology would also integrate and allow us to have a more consistent present, like district-owned presence when we're pushing out to social media.

700
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:27,814
I think a lot of that happens sort of catch-as-catch-can now for lots of reasons, but if Blackboard can start to be the integrator

701
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:40,912
of those kinds of posts, I think that also allows people to start to dial in their social media interests if those posts are all coming from the same place.

702
01:22:40,952 --> 01:22:57,000
But I do feel like at times I see posts from all over the place as it relates to my kids going to school that we could consolidate with a tool that can do that for us.

703
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,851
And so actually, I think that's a good point.

704
01:22:59,871 --> 01:23:07,075
I think the other thing too, though, is that we need to really look at consolidating social media accounts.

705
01:23:08,055 --> 01:23:22,302
And because here's the thing is we are supposed to be, and we are, but all school districts are supposed to independently archive separate from anything native to say Facebook or Twitter or whatever it may be.

706
01:23:23,059 --> 01:23:28,360
we are required to independently archive all of these social media accounts.

707
01:23:28,981 --> 01:23:44,485
And so what a lot of districts have done is they've streamlined and only have a few accounts, all right, to keep information centralized, but then you're also limiting the amount that you have to back up or the amount of accounts you have to back up.

708
01:23:45,825 --> 01:23:52,367
And does Blackboard provide or maybe a requirement that sort of coming out is

709
01:23:53,508 --> 01:24:05,174
a place to natively store those posts that ultimately push out so that somebody can go in and say, these are the posts I'm going to make.

710
01:24:05,294 --> 01:24:08,436
And they're going to go to these various social media platforms on this date.

711
01:24:08,516 --> 01:24:10,737
And you sort of set it and forget it.

712
01:24:11,258 --> 01:24:17,301
You also have that archival space, that archival place, because it's all in a central application.

713
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:21,123
And you're not natively copying and pasting on Facebook and on Twitter.

714
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:33,748
your Facebook account gets deleted, you still have the platform, it's a CRM platform typically, that sort of comes to mind for me, where you would then have all of that like right in the platform.

715
01:24:35,649 --> 01:24:46,317
I don't know if Blackboard has that capability or if some sort of additional platform is needed to handle that social media integration piece.

716
01:24:46,882 --> 01:24:50,323
So the first part, yes, it can definitely handle that.

717
01:24:51,043 --> 01:24:55,244
But I don't know the answer to the archival aspect.

718
01:24:55,304 --> 01:25:02,866
So it saves messages to a certain degree, like a certain time span.

719
01:25:04,067 --> 01:25:10,228
But as right now, in School Messenger, you have to specifically request to save the message content.

720
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:13,609
Otherwise, it's not saved.

721
01:25:14,529 --> 01:25:14,849
Got it.

722
01:25:17,559 --> 01:25:26,427
So there may be a good reason to, as we sort of consolidate our social media presence, have a tool that allows us to do that.

723
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,792
I mean, I use one for my organization.

724
01:25:31,873 --> 01:25:34,335
It's very inexpensive.

725
01:25:34,675 --> 01:25:39,199
I don't even know what we pay for it, but it's probably less than $100 a year or something like that.

726
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:41,762
It's very inexpensive, but it allows us to

727
01:25:42,427 --> 01:25:48,352
to proactively say this is what we're going to do on this day, take the time, set it all up, and then it's there forever.

728
01:25:48,372 --> 01:25:58,079
So it might be something if Blackboard can't do that, there might be another tool out there that would enable something like that to happen and provide that archival.

729
01:26:03,983 --> 01:26:06,946
Does anybody have any other questions or comments?

730
01:26:07,006 --> 01:26:08,587
I think we have like one minute left.

731
01:26:09,502 --> 01:26:18,047
And I was hoping we would finish early because somebody was taking claim of finishing a meeting early last week, but I'll settle for just on time.

732
01:26:18,087 --> 01:26:22,750
You said we're going to have a competition member Graham from now on.

733
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,631
We're all competing to see who can end on time or early.

734
01:26:25,671 --> 01:26:27,032
I don't know what the prize is going to be.

735
01:26:27,092 --> 01:26:28,893
So don't get your hopes up too much.

736
01:26:31,074 --> 01:26:33,876
Is there anything else before we adjourn?

737
01:26:36,478 --> 01:26:37,138
Motion to adjourn.

738
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:46,713
All right, a motion to adjourn by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kretz.

739
01:26:47,634 --> 01:26:49,095
So roll call, member McLaughlin?

740
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:50,156
Yes.

741
01:26:50,876 --> 01:26:51,376
Member Kretz?

742
01:26:51,977 --> 01:26:52,177
Yes.

743
01:26:53,077 --> 01:26:53,638
Member Graham?

744
01:26:53,738 --> 01:26:53,998
Yes.

745
01:26:54,838 --> 01:26:55,539
Meeting is adjourned.

746
01:26:55,559 --> 01:26:56,339
Great meeting.

747
01:26:56,359 --> 01:26:56,960
Thank you, everyone.

748
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:57,180
Bye.

749
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,580
Bye.
