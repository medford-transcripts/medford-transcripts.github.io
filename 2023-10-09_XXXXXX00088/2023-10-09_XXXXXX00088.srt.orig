[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:45,882
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you so much for being with us today.

10
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:50,644
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:52,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

12
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:55,425
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Rick Caraviello, and my pronoun would be he, him.

13
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,345
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a current Method City Councilor.

14
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,366
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going on my sixth term.

15
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:04,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a current candidate for Mayor of the City of Method.

16
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:05,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

17
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:09,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are going to talk much more about your campaign for mayor.

18
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:16,414
[SPEAKER_04]: But before we do that, we just want to ask you the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

19
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:17,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do you like to eat there?

20
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:21,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have several places I eat.

21
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:23,439
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever met me, I'm kind of a bigger guy.

22
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,541
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think I've missed many meals.

23
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:31,265
[SPEAKER_00]: But I pretty much try to frequent everywhere.

24
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:34,628
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the owners of the restaurants are my friends over the years.

25
00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:41,629
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the vault, I go to Razzo's, Bocelli's, Avellino's.

26
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:44,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pretty much hit the game at all times.

27
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably, I probably do Razzo's a little more than some of the other places.

28
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:53,772
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's food is always pretty good there.

29
00:01:54,553 --> 00:01:54,873
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

30
00:01:55,813 --> 00:01:57,533
[SPEAKER_00]: It's food is always very good there.

31
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of Italian I'm hearing there.

32
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:02,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a favorite dish at any of those places?

33
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:08,426
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I always try to look at the specials first and get something that I don't have at home.

34
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:13,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter what restaurant I go to, that's where I always look first.

35
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:16,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

36
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:18,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I did notice you're having a fundraiser at Casey's in Somerville.

37
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:21,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I, we, we had that last week.

38
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:22,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you did.

39
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:22,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

40
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:23,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, that was last week.

41
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

42
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, see, that already happened.

43
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:34,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I actually had my engagement party there, uh, many years ago and we, I used to live like right next door, but I was wondering how, uh, why you picked a place in Somerville.

44
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they were owned by, it's owned by a method family.

45
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:38,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.

46
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:39,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you knew that.

47
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:40,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.

48
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:41,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice people there.

49
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:42,476
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, that's why.

50
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:46,440
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also having another event.

51
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:46,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

52
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:49,783
[SPEAKER_00]: in a couple of weeks, women for Rick Caraviello.

53
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Over at the board on October 5th.

54
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:55,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, awesome.

55
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,265
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make sure to put that in our show notes so people can.

56
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:01,305
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Shelley, I'll hand it over to you.

57
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:02,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so let's jump in.

58
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:15,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick, maybe you could start out by teaching us a little bit about the motivation behind running for mayor and some of the thought processes that have gone into your decision to consider candidacy.

59
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:16,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

60
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:24,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, I've been on the council for, uh, this would be my sixth term, but it would be close to 12 years.

61
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:29,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I'm not happy with the direction that the city is going right now.

62
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:36,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I could, uh, I think I can do a better job, um, with, uh, things that are happening or not happening.

63
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little disappointed with, uh,

64
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:51,685
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a tremendous building boom that's gone through the area and we didn't capitalize on it, which I don't know if you've been to Malden, see what they did in Malden.

65
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,147
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did that during the COVID time.

66
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:55,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Assembly Square.

67
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:57,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, buildings are still going up there.

68
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:02,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So Everett, I mean, and everybody has sort of passed us by.

69
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:05,712
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have anything even in the pipeline.

70
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:07,633
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about a lot of stuff.

71
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:10,063
[SPEAKER_00]: but nothing has happened right now.

72
00:04:10,203 --> 00:04:15,085
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see your interest rates through the roof, um, building costs are high.

73
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:18,606
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're seeing nothing happening here in Medford.

74
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:26,469
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you say like, um, building, you're talking about like housing business, all of the above housing.

75
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:33,412
[SPEAKER_00]: We, um, we have two 40 B projects that would probably put almost a thousand, uh,

76
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:38,655
[SPEAKER_00]: rental units on the market, which 25% of them would be affordable.

77
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:42,656
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is still stuck in court for three years.

78
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:49,778
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is sort of going through its process, but that was stuck in court for three years.

79
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:57,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just wasted legal fees on cases that historically cities don't win against 40B projects.

80
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's the role of the mayor in something like that?

81
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:08,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would assume that the mayor made the decision to challenge these in the court.

82
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,677
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a council decision.

83
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,562
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody talks about affordable housing.

84
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:21,188
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, this is the only avenue to get affordable housing is through these 40Bs.

85
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:34,724
[SPEAKER_04]: So one thing you're naming that's motivating you to run for mayor is sort of like the increase in business and building in the city.

86
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:38,646
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that you're noticing isn't happening at the rate that you'd want it to.

87
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,386
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is correct.

88
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:50,370
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get calls from other people in development saying, if we come here, do we have places for our people to live?

89
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,892
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is no at the moment.

90
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,582
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd say that's been a positive thing for me to run for mayor.

91
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say that a little bit more, what you mean about that?

92
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,466
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no places for people to live.

93
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:05,126
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry?

94
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:06,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say what you mean about like what?

95
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:11,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I get calls from, I've been getting calls from developers who want to come bring their business to Medford.

96
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're saying, if we come here, do we have a place for our employees to live?

97
00:06:16,496 --> 00:06:19,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And housing isn't a premium in Medford.

98
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:23,381
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, you know, when you're turning away,

99
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:32,507
[SPEAKER_00]: 800, 900, 1,000 units of permits, which are not impacting neighborhoods, that says something.

100
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:36,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what would you do differently?

101
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:41,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope that we can get these projects back on track and get them done.

102
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:47,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're losing millions of dollars in tax revenue by them just sitting idle.

103
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:52,073
[SPEAKER_00]: And never mind the amount of legal fees that we're spending to defend these cases that are not winnable.

104
00:06:54,423 --> 00:07:09,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are criticisms of like our current mayor's job but what about like what would, how do you, how do you think you would approach the office or think like sort of reason like what what are kind of your priorities for what you would do as I think we should, we should have sat down and negotiated.

105
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:15,234
[SPEAKER_00]: on day one, instead of immediately sending them off to court.

106
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:30,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the one that's almost ready to come through, at the end of the day, we ended up losing 50 apartments, and we didn't really get anything out of it, other than wasting three years of nothing and lost tax revenue and building permit fees.

107
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:39,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, again, I think like, this also seems like focusing on the job that's currently being done, but like for you, where would you start?

108
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:44,555
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you wanna do if on your first day as mayor if elected?

109
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:52,660
[SPEAKER_00]: On my first day in office, first of all, I would talk to everybody in city hall first.

110
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,883
[SPEAKER_00]: And my thing in city hall was the word no will no longer exist.

111
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:08,487
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm tired of hearing from people saying I go to departments and all I hear is no, no.

112
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:13,308
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that word no to exist anymore.

113
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:18,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Government is there to help people, not just shut the door on them and say, no, I can't do anything.

114
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,550
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer should be, let me see what I can do to help you.

115
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:30,513
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to plan to redevelop areas of say Mystic Avenue is

116
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:49,443
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 years of no development there in our, you know, and then on the past election, our current we have ran on on stopping development on Mr Gavin you and now here we are another three years later, and nothing's going on there, Mr Gavin you was the gateway to Medford.

117
00:08:50,837 --> 00:08:59,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you said, so I want to go back to what you were saying about City Hall when you say like, you're hearing a lot of people saying no, and that their job of government is to help.

118
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:00,984
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

119
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:04,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, what do you think that and like, can you say more about like that?

120
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:05,988
[SPEAKER_04]: What are what is being said no to?

121
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:10,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I know the mayor talks about changing the culture of City Hall.

122
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:13,794
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have we have so many vacant positions there.

123
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:18,317
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that, which, which is a really a big, big issue there.

124
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:26,460
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're short staffed in most of the office because when either people just aren't coming, you know, we can't hire them.

125
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:34,083
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say when they go there, they're tired of making phone calls to departments and not even getting the phone picked up.

126
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:40,891
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they get there, sometimes they get a little bit of attitude, but people tell them no.

127
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:45,633
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a city solicitor to guide us on any of our issues also.

128
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:50,054
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have legal stuff piling up that sit there and do nothing.

129
00:09:52,778 --> 00:10:00,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I do hear that like hiring across the board in lots of cities and lots of just like businesses has been difficult recently.

130
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:05,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I do wonder too about how the budget impacts that.

131
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:06,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what are we able to pay people?

132
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:15,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is some of this like not being able to solve problems related to financial resources that the city has?

133
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:17,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a little bit of both.

134
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:21,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're not known as the best payers in the

135
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:29,402
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal world, I think we have to increase the salaries of department heads in order to attract people here also.

136
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:30,843
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the problem.

137
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:38,289
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you're looking for a city solicitor that, you know, you want to pay them, you know, not a lot of money and that's an issue.

138
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:50,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think restructuring some salaries would have to be done, you know, going forward, not on day one, but that's a discussion that has to be had with the council because that needs council approval.

139
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:56,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they did vote on that in the council, did we recently vote on increasing salaries at city hall?

140
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:03,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, some, uh, some of them did get increases, uh, some didn't.

141
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:05,195
[SPEAKER_04]: But how did you vote?

142
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:06,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you vote on that?

143
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:07,756
[SPEAKER_04]: And how did you vote on that?

144
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:08,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I voted in favor.

145
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:10,338
[SPEAKER_04]: In favor of increasing salaries.

146
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:10,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

147
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:17,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let's say we don't listen to these people need to need to have a living wage and I'm in all in favor of that.

148
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:19,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

149
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:37,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Though Rick claims in this interview that he voted to increase salaries for employees of City Hall, in a April 25th City Council meeting he actually voted no to increase cost of living raises and salaries for City Hall employees.

150
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:44,000
[SPEAKER_04]: A link is provided in the show notes to those meeting minutes and the following is an audio clip of that vote.

151
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:50,993
[SPEAKER_01]: 23-059, proposed wage adjustment for non-union personnel, eligible for third reading, April 25th, 2023.

152
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have a motion?

153
00:11:53,155 --> 00:11:55,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Approve the third reading.

154
00:11:55,597 --> 00:12:00,321
[SPEAKER_01]: On the motion of Vice Chair Behrs to approve the third reading, seconded by Councilor Sang.

155
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:01,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

156
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:15,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

157
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:28,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think 1 of the things we try to focus on in this podcast is sort of the idea of equity and inclusivity among the city.

158
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's something that we've seen change a little bit over the last couple of years, like, having more.

159
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:45,967
[SPEAKER_04]: representation in city government from folks maybe who have been less represented, like women, like folks of color, renters.

160
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:55,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering how you see the issue of equity in Medford and sort of what your kind of goals would be in terms of increasing equity in the city.

161
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all in favor of a fair and equitable process for everyone.

162
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe also how your role as mayor might support, you know, like folks of color,

163
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:12,470
[SPEAKER_02]: women you mentioned with the women for care of yellow event at the Ford, I have no issue with women are people of color.

164
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I'm interested.

165
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:17,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything should be fair and equitable everybody.

166
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:22,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm glad to hear you have no issue with women or people of color.

167
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that.

168
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:32,232
[SPEAKER_04]: But how do you imagine increasing representation of those folks or outreach to those communities?

169
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:33,313
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel?

170
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:44,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think what we've been hearing in the last couple of years, especially around 2020 when city council was voting on making racism a public health emergency,

171
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:56,389
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you imagine we can do better as a city in sort of including those sort of different groups of people?

172
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:05,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, I think if you've been in City Hall lately, you'll see it's mostly women in there.

173
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:11,421
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of women of color that have taken, we have a

174
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:18,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity Director Frances Nwaji has done an outstanding job since she's come on.

175
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:22,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I give her credit, the mayor credit, that was a good hire.

176
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:30,480
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also didn't have in the past, we didn't have human resources either.

177
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,321
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now have a human resources director, which is a positive thing too.

178
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:45,699
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, everyone that gets hired will be interviewed fairly and we'll go from there.

179
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:58,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like women in City Hall hold roles where their decision-making power has weight for, you know, the direction of the city or choices that will affect people?

180
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Most certainly.

181
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:05,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our board of health director is a woman.

182
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Our diversity director is a woman.

183
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Our HR director is a woman.

184
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Our superintendent is a woman.

185
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:21,118
[SPEAKER_00]: So women pretty much dominate the political scene in Medford.

186
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:21,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

187
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:26,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are like, those, like I said, are hires of our mostly for the most part hires of our current mayor.

188
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:41,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And so how would you continue or expand or like, how would you sort of make that, you're mentioning staff and I'm wondering about like residents, constituents, like how are we like including those people, engaging those people in our city that maybe haven't been engaged.

189
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:47,525
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you look at the boards and commissions, they're both, uh, they're both men and women, uh, people of color.

190
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:48,726
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of boards that I,

191
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,772
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't happy with because I didn't think they were diverse enough, especially the charter commission.

192
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:59,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel represented the city correctly because on that board, there's no person of color.

193
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:07,898
[SPEAKER_00]: The largest population growth in the city of Medford is Asian and there's nobody from the Asian community on that board either.

194
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:12,261
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a little disappointed with the makeup of that board.

195
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:17,343
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we would have learned from our mistakes that we made with the Mr. Tuck School by

196
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,503
[SPEAKER_00]: just putting one group on the commission there.

197
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what would you do to change that?

198
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:39,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how would you change how that, how those things are- When they're appointed, I think you need to take a look and see who's on the board and just appoint everybody fair and equitable from all walks of life in the city of Medford.

199
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:40,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

200
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, so let's say like those boards, like I'm on the Charter Review Commission, which I would agree lacks a lot of diversity.

201
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,172
[SPEAKER_04]: But we applied for those positions, right?

202
00:16:48,832 --> 00:17:01,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's say no people of color or no people of any sort of, I mean, there's also a lot of people that are older on that committee and a lot of people that have lived in Medford for a long time.

203
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:08,659
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you imagine we can get more people to apply that have varied identities?

204
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the mayor should have reached out to more neighborhoods to encourage them to apply.

205
00:17:16,023 --> 00:17:26,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I, one of my major concerns in the beginning was I wanted to see a representative from every ward on the Charter Commission.

206
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:30,727
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my, one of my things right from day one.

207
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:35,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So like ward representation in that sense is important to you?

208
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:41,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I wanted to see a representative from every ward of the city on that Charter Commission.

209
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the NOC is, everybody's from West Medford that's on the committees.

210
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:56,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always been, you know, because listen, I get it, people volunteer this week and you try to take the volunteers, but all the volunteers always seem to come out of the West Memphis area.

211
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:02,190
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we could have reached out and did a better job.

212
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:09,976
[SPEAKER_04]: So something you would consider doing yourself if you had the job would be to change that outreach model?

213
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:10,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

214
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:19,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the mayor or other people in the office, they could have reached out to other people and try to sway them to get on these committees.

215
00:18:22,924 --> 00:18:26,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about your opinions or your perspective on volunteerism, right?

216
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:41,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from my experience at the HRC, I think one significant boundary is that the amount of time required to participate effectively is often not available to folks who are marginalized in a multitude of ways.

217
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:50,203
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you're talking to probably the most person who's volunteered the most out of anybody in the whole city over the last 30 years than me.

218
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:56,386
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on boards, commissions, food banks, library, you name it.

219
00:18:56,587 --> 00:19:01,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Caraviello has been a volunteer for 30 plus years, long before I got into governments.

220
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always a community volunteer.

221
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:07,633
[SPEAKER_02]: But is that without another source of income?

222
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:12,866
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just something I did.

223
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:13,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd always been a volunteer.

224
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:18,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, I've been on the Chamber of Commerce.

225
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:21,269
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, you name it, the Library Commission.

226
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:25,770
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also had an income available to you while you were volunteering.

227
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider myself semi-retired, too.

228
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:34,292
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have an income, and I volunteer.

229
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,053
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you're married, right?

230
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have access to a partner.

231
00:19:39,153 --> 00:19:41,515
[SPEAKER_00]: I am married for 47 years.

232
00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:44,236
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three children and I have eight grandchildren.

233
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

234
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:50,140
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of male careers are built from decades of unpaid labor performed by female partners.

235
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:50,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

236
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, when we're talking about women participating commissions, we often don't have access to that.

237
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:57,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confused with the question.

238
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think she's saying that like

239
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:17,122
[SPEAKER_04]: What allows folks to volunteer is like an assumption that they have an income that supports their family so like I can volunteer at night because I don't have to work at night I work during the day to support my family, and my wife watches our kids so that I can do that work right like.

240
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:24,668
[SPEAKER_04]: So and I think what we know about marginalized communities is they might not have the time to volunteer, right?

241
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:37,618
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they were given a stipend, or if there was some other, or child care was provided for volunteering for these positions, that would attract a more diverse audience, or a more diverse pool of applicants.

242
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:41,662
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some boards and commissions that do pay stipends.

243
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too many of them that do that.

244
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:54,750
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that would have to be discussed about changing the board.

245
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:59,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but you know, childcare is always an issue.

246
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:04,315
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we, I know we lack childcare, afterschool childcare in the city of Medford.

247
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:08,538
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been an advocate of moving that forward, you know, increasing childcare.

248
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:11,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, the days of the mom staying home,

249
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:16,730
[SPEAKER_00]: When I grew up or kind of my mom always worked also so I'm on the fire both work.

250
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:23,714
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you don't see the latchkey kids anymore, where kids go home with the key and you wait for your parents get on those days.

251
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:28,538
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to expand our after school childcare programs.

252
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:31,279
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always been an issue of mine.

253
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:34,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

254
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,564
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking a little bit about the Charter Review Committee.

255
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:43,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if you have any thoughts about the reviews to the charter.

256
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:47,469
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned feeling it important to have representatives from each ward on that committee.

257
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:50,410
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel about ward representation in general?

258
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:57,854
[SPEAKER_00]: My honest opinion is I was never a proponent of ward representation.

259
00:21:58,254 --> 00:22:02,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it gives you bigger governments with less representation.

260
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:09,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody from any part of the city can call me and I'm there for them.

261
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:15,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Where sometimes they feel afraid to reach out of their ward or whatever to call somebody.

262
00:22:15,894 --> 00:22:20,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So not a proponent of order.

263
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:24,258
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the will of the people, that's fine.

264
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:32,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the will of the people is, that's my personal, I just think it just gives you better government, I mean, bigger government with less representation.

265
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:41,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think too, like, there's, you know, and looking at the, at how Medford is structured, we have 7 city councilors and 8 wards.

266
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:50,502
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's already automatically, like, parts of the city that aren't represented, even if we, even if those 7 city councilors were equally distributed among the city, which we know they're not.

267
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:58,046
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think too, one of the things that the charter is looking at is balance of power and the mayor has an incredible amount of power right now.

268
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:06,950
[SPEAKER_04]: If that were your position in the future, what are your thoughts on balance of power for our city government?

269
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,252
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always believed that the council should be a partner in government.

270
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:19,176
[SPEAKER_00]: From the day I've been elected, that was always a peeve of mine that the council was always left out of things.

271
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:27,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I've served with three different mayors, and our charter says we're supposed to meet with the mayor every month.

272
00:23:27,846 --> 00:23:28,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I correct with that?

273
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:30,947
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about that.

274
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:31,947
[SPEAKER_00]: It was part of the charter.

275
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:38,509
[SPEAKER_00]: In 12 years, I don't think we've met with all three mayors a dozen times.

276
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be lying with that.

277
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,152
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a proponent of being a partner with the council because you need the council.

278
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:50,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I told the people that are running for council that if I'm elected mayor,

279
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:52,894
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be a partner in government.

280
00:23:54,596 --> 00:24:00,585
[SPEAKER_00]: If it means changing some of the structure, that's all well and fine, but they need to have more say.

281
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:07,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil, do you have any other thoughts?

282
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:27,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm just reflecting on maybe goals for the role or, you know, when you're talking about partnering with the council, my head goes to sort of longer term, how you might use the full term, um, you know, to serve the city or what kind of change priorities you have, um, or what your long game might be, those kinds of.

283
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:34,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, uh, on, on the, on the term limits of the two year term versus the four year term.

284
00:24:34,469 --> 00:24:35,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the question you're asking?

285
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,278
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just curious.

286
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:40,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a lot of the conversation has been around what happens if you do get elected.

287
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:45,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wonder what your long-term thoughts, hopes, plans for Medford might be.

288
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,360
[SPEAKER_00]: My long-term hope is to bring the city together.

289
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:54,061
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you hear about the big discussion about new Medford, old Medford.

290
00:24:55,442 --> 00:24:56,342
[SPEAKER_00]: I want one Medford.

291
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:59,042
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to bring everybody back into the middle.

292
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:02,283
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen, we've become a divided community over the last few years.

293
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:04,234
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like that.

294
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:05,394
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that at all.

295
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:06,995
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should be united.

296
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:13,099
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a happy medium where the new residents are happy, and the old residents are happy.

297
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:16,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, everybody knows it's part of the gentrification of cities.

298
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:24,126
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to bring everybody back into the middle and make it inviting for everybody, not new or old.

299
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:25,707
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to serve everybody.

300
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:27,608
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we do that?

301
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:29,610
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hard thing.

302
00:25:30,498 --> 00:25:41,765
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I want to do, both as a person, whether I'm on the council or mayor or not, it's just something I believe that should happen.

303
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:46,988
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be a warm and welcoming community to everybody who lives here.

304
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:53,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want people to feel left out because they just moved here, and I don't want the people who lived here all life to feel like the new people are pushing them out.

305
00:25:54,373 --> 00:25:59,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I hear as I'm going around to people.

306
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:10,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I think that is an idea that probably brings a lot of peace to people.

307
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:18,642
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do wonder like the how, because it sounds like it would take some conversations and some work to sort of bring people together.

308
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:19,663
[SPEAKER_04]: It would.

309
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:20,484
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take some work.

310
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:23,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you that's an easy task.

311
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:24,907
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a task.

312
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:28,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think by more community events,

313
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:34,161
[SPEAKER_00]: involving both old and new when we do something.

314
00:26:34,222 --> 00:26:39,506
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody feels involved, not just the new people doing stuff or the old people doing stuff.

315
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,407
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can do things together.

316
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:44,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

317
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

318
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:50,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other things that you want to make sure that you mention that we haven't asked you about?

319
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:56,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, probably my proudest achievement as a city councilor was bringing the library to Medford.

320
00:26:58,134 --> 00:27:03,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I worked on for four years and I brought it, I brought it to the library with a funding source.

321
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:13,364
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I also sit on the, I'm the vice chair of the, of the, of the public library foundation, which we've helped raise $6 million to defray the cost.

322
00:27:13,404 --> 00:27:20,869
[SPEAKER_00]: So we essentially own a state of the art, a state of the art library for close to 50 cents on the dollar.

323
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one, not many communities are saying that and people, people are amazed at what we've done.

324
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:28,279
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring the library here.

325
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,261
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, we actually brought it in under budget.

326
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:36,683
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now that's probably one of the greatest resources in the community.

327
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:44,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also instrumental in bringing the art center that's gonna be opening to Medford in a couple of months.

328
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:55,814
[SPEAKER_00]: When the people from the Cannabis Commission, not commission, but the Cannabis Theory of Wellness reached out to me, they said, we have 5,000 square feet of space.

329
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:58,913
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do with it?

330
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:03,675
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, the art community has been looking for a home for the last 20 years.

331
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,216
[SPEAKER_00]: This is perfect.

332
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:07,196
[SPEAKER_00]: They agreed.

333
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:12,478
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to my fellow counselor, Max, who was part of the arts commission and the art people.

334
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:14,739
[SPEAKER_00]: We hooked them up together.

335
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:22,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And three years of waiting for it to get approved, we're going to have an art center for free.

336
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:30,178
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right on Mr. Galloway, which is, again, another source of pride for myself and the council.

337
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looks beautiful, the pictures that I've seen.

338
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's going to be great.

339
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:36,401
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be great.

340
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:37,561
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have a home.

341
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:47,466
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to have to worry about for, you know, I know eventually they're going to have to start paying rent, but at least they'll have, you know, so many years to start saving some money.

342
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:53,509
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when it comes time to have to, you know, have to start paying, they'll have it.

343
00:28:56,354 --> 00:28:58,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?

344
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:01,897
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about it.

345
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:05,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want to ask about me?

346
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we do like to ask a fun fact.

347
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:12,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about you that we might not know or something that might surprise us to learn about you.

348
00:29:14,264 --> 00:29:16,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I've been involved in many things over the years.

349
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:23,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason I got involved, I was never really a political person,

350
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:27,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I served as president of the Youth Hockey Association.

351
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,653
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, the old MDC, which is now the DCR, was going to condemn the building.

352
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:38,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were going to tear it down because there was no funding.

353
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:44,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started going to our local representatives and staying there at the state house.

354
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:53,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I found a friend, the late Senator Shannon, who delivered half a million dollars

355
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,241
[SPEAKER_00]: to the rink, kept it open, and that's why it's still open today.

356
00:29:57,281 --> 00:30:02,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my picture hangs down there at the rink with then-Governor Weld to keep it open.

357
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:05,643
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been a real source of pride for me, too.

358
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:07,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, I just take pride in what I do.

359
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:09,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a community person.

360
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:18,906
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I say, I still work at the food bank, even though, you know, a lot of people have passed off, and then I do that every week.

361
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:21,387
[SPEAKER_00]: I belong to the Memphis Kiwanis Club.

362
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:26,258
[SPEAKER_00]: I still sit on, I'm still the vice chair of the Public Library Foundation.

363
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:29,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a president and executive director of the Chamber of Commerce.

364
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:36,844
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, what you didn't know is, as my term as president, the executive director passed away.

365
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:46,550
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sat in as executive director for two years with no pay until they finally brought someone in and then they had the money to pay somebody.

366
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do take pride in my community.

367
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:51,673
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the Chamber of Commerce you were just saying?

368
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:51,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

369
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:54,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

370
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:58,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, any other, anything else you want to mention before you wrap up?

371
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,203
[SPEAKER_00]: That's anything you want to ask me.

372
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:05,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you mentioned the Ford, maybe just the Ford.

373
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:08,606
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, I think, uh, that's about it for me.

374
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:18,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're running, uh, I, you know, I have a bunch of house parties happening at different places, but, uh, you know, coming down to the last, uh, 60, 70 days and I'm just trying to, you know,

375
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:28,070
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the phone every day, making phone calls, trying to beat the, you know, beating up the pavement a little bit and just trying to be as active as possible.

376
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:29,611
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

377
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much for your time.

378
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:31,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

379
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:32,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.

00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:43,643
