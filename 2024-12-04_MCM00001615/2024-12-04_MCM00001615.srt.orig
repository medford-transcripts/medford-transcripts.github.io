1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:16,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, why don't we start by just going through the administrative stuff, and we approve the minutes from last time, motion to approve the minutes from last time.

2
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:19,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry I sent those out so late, everybody.

3
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:22,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get a chance to look at them?

4
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:24,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, yeah.

5
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:28,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at it before we started the meeting.

6
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:34,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Did everybody else get a chance to look at them?

7
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:39,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, I honestly did an overview of it, but it looked good from what I saw.

8
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:45,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not look at them.

9
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:47,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I did either.

10
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:53,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can wait off on approving it, Brenda.

11
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:56,075
[SPEAKER_04]: We can discuss it for the next meeting?

12
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:57,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

13
00:00:57,816 --> 00:00:58,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

14
00:00:58,656 --> 00:00:59,357
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good.

15
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:12,620
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I wanted to bring up here, I know tonight's meeting was supposed to be a hybrid and that didn't pan out.

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to make the December meeting a hybrid meeting?

17
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:22,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure, yeah.

18
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:26,928
[SPEAKER_04]: If we keep it on Monday, I should be able to come into the office.

19
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:29,269
[SPEAKER_02]: What day would it be, Brenda?

20
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday.

21
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:35,104
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know, like, what date, like, like December 16th.

22
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:41,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think that'd be, that'd be bad.

23
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:42,208
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

24
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Natasha, Stacey, any thoughts?

25
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.

26
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:56,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good.

27
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:59,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever the group decides is good with me.

28
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:06,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I am good, but if anything come up, I'll let you guys know.

29
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:08,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

30
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:16,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the meeting after that is on a holiday.

31
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:18,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Martin Luther King Day.

32
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,111
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that?

33
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be absent on that day.

34
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:34,925
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so do we want to move it to a different day and what day would be best for you?

35
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:38,787
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would have been January 20th.

36
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:44,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want to postpone it to the week after or before?

37
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the 27th?

38
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

39
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind the 27th.

40
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:53,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Either date should work for me.

41
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:57,446
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the December date?

42
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:58,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

43
00:02:58,146 --> 00:03:05,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Martin Luther King Day is on the 20th, so we could either- December, the December date.

44
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:05,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the December.

45
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:06,792
[SPEAKER_06]: The hybrid date.

46
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Will be December 16th.

47
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:10,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sorry about that.

48
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:12,195
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

49
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:14,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have been writing it down.

50
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:21,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so for January, we can either do it on the 13th or the 27th.

51
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:21,621
[SPEAKER_04]: 27th is good.

52
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:29,133
[SPEAKER_04]: 27.

53
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:29,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.

54
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:30,934
[SPEAKER_04]: It works for me.

55
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:33,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Natasha, does that work for you?

56
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me one second.

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm checking my calendar.

58
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:38,281
27.

59
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:40,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a Monday?

60
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:41,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

61
00:03:41,123 --> 00:03:41,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Monday, 530?

62
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:42,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

63
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:50,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is this calendar like this?

64
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:07,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess we'll move it to Monday, January 27.

65
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:11,087
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds great.

66
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:25,711
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were just talking earlier, before everyone joined, that it sounds like the calendar invitations that I thought everybody had are not actually appearing on your calendars.

67
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:30,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to delete those and send out new ones.

68
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me know if you

69
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:46,372
[SPEAKER_01]: receive them just so that like just reply yes to them so that I have that information because I thought you've been getting them the whole time.

70
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:16,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other sort of administrative things that we want to talk about?

71
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:27,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than just go over the city actions, right?

72
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, but that's not that's not under the administration.

73
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:34,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't have anything really.

74
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else?

75
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Have any concerns.

76
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:47,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Administrative I'm sorry January 27 will this be hybrid or zoned.

77
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:56,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we had talked about alternating between zoom and hybrid, so it would be zoom only.

78
00:05:56,828 --> 00:06:00,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, unless you would prefer it to be hybrid.

79
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

80
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:16,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda.

81
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:20,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Under administrative, it says introduction of guests.

82
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:23,836
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't see.

83
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:26,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm reading the wrong 1.

84
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking at the minutes from the last.

85
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting 1 with you.

86
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

87
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because we had guests last time we don't have any.

88
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:00,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, do we want to move on to the.

89
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Bedford connects events.

90
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

91
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:07,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

92
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:07,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

93
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:10,857
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, how did the winter preparedness event go?

94
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:17,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't there, unfortunately, but so I was just asking everybody else.

95
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:22,593
[SPEAKER_04]: The lady from ABCD end up coming.

96
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:25,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Her name is Roxanne, I think.

97
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:26,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

98
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:27,617
[SPEAKER_02]: She did.

99
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:28,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

100
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:31,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

101
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,540
[SPEAKER_02]: But in all honesty, it was a really good event.

102
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,562
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of people.

103
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:36,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

104
00:07:37,383 --> 00:07:38,383
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people.

105
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:41,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went to set up our table.

106
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:45,748
[SPEAKER_01]: and leave, because I had the stuff.

107
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were people lined up for it, like 45 minutes beforehand.

108
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,311
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to hear.

109
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:56,272
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.

110
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:58,592
[SPEAKER_08]: And people were still coming in, too.

111
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:05,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Even after I left, I left like, I think around close to 730-ish.

112
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:09,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Were there enough coats and hats for everybody?

113
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

114
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:11,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

115
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:23,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's helping I was helping Jennifer with some of the stuff that Alicia's or Alicia's Alicia's your what?

116
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

117
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia.

118
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:26,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

119
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:26,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

120
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:28,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what I say.

121
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:33,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I think because my mom says Alicia, so I get, sorry.

122
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:38,730
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's the stuff that her organization had donated, like the hats and stuff.

123
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:44,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And that alone was a lot, you know, nevermind the coats and everything that was donated.

124
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:48,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good to hear that it was enough stuff for everybody.

125
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:53,893
[SPEAKER_01]: So you didn't run out of hats and coats and things like that?

126
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no.

127
00:08:55,993 --> 00:09:09,937
[SPEAKER_02]: In all honesty, even even if we did like run out, we had like the list of like people to put their names and stuff for like what's up later, like chats, just in case they needed something, they could reach out.

128
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:18,519
[SPEAKER_02]: But scarves and and and, you know, hats and everything, there was like a ton of them left over.

129
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Jackets was really good, right, Stacey?

130
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:25,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Natasha, it was, it wasn't.

131
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:27,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was funny.

132
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,325
[SPEAKER_06]: We left with, we packed up some coats and stuff as well.

133
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,669
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but everything left over.

134
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:38,049
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens to the things that are left over?

135
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:39,669
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good question.

136
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:41,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really sure what happened to them.

137
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,611
[SPEAKER_06]: There were still some people, you know, we were putting things in bags and boxes.

138
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:54,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really sure where they were gonna land, but there were still people there that were going through stuff and still taking stuff.

139
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:59,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the Medford Family Network takes whatever's left.

140
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:04,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, gives them to families, but I'm not 100% sure.

141
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:07,025
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think that's what Catherine was saying.

142
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:09,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me.

143
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wasn't sure what was going to happen.

144
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:24,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Because like Lizette was saying, there was talk about, you know, taking names just in case we got calls and folks needed some things or they were calling looking for some things.

145
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:26,632
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, yeah.

146
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:31,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, it was a successful event, Brenda.

147
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, really good.

148
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to hear.

149
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:40,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It was night and day from last year.

150
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:43,486
[SPEAKER_02]: big time.

151
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:52,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this year was just more like organization and you know more thought out than like last year.

152
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:59,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year I mean like I guess the only flaw was just not having everyone like grab one jacket.

153
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,931
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a limit right?

154
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:05,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the jackets immediately like went out when we like opened.

155
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:09,354
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think for this time we did really really good job.

156
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,054
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, I think the being at city hall was was a benefit as well.

157
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:25,384
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, parking and the size of the room and and people just kind of probably see in city hall for the 1st time too.

158
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:25,864
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

159
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:28,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the city.

160
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:31,493
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't in the library.

161
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:33,434
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the big room in the library.

162
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:48,345
[SPEAKER_02]: But in all honesty, I do feel, like Stacey said, like being in the City Hall, it's a different type of like, you see City Hall in a different light, not just like all like, you know, meetings and all this other stuff and like official things.

163
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:54,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to use the chambers for like a event like that was really like cool.

164
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:55,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think

165
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:13,739
[SPEAKER_02]: In all honesty, we should be using that more often for all of our, like, events and stuff so people can get comfortable to coming, you know, into the building and then getting information right on the spot instead of having to go to the library or this other place or whatever.

166
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,680
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, like, right there, you know?

167
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

168
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:21,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you partner with more organizations this year?

169
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:23,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

170
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:31,639
[SPEAKER_06]: It seemed like there were definitely more people there, it seems, this year.

171
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Seemed that way anyway.

172
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

173
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:42,101
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

174
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:44,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very sad that I couldn't be there.

175
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:49,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did the Electrify Medford table go okay?

176
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:50,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

177
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:55,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always nervous, but I'm not there.

178
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:57,188
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, don't be.

179
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:00,431
[SPEAKER_02]: The table still gets people there.

180
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:03,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, Natasha, what's your friend's name?

181
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,456
[SPEAKER_02]: The one from the Haitian task force?

182
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:07,778
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the one who... Ruth.

183
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:08,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Ruth.

184
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:11,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then Zila came afterwards.

185
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did very well with the table.

186
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:14,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

187
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:27,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, any other events coming up?

188
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:36,887
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the winter extravaganza, December 4th.

189
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:42,828
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not next Wednesday, but the Wednesday after.

190
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:48,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're all going to be there because that's when our meetings are anyway.

191
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So should be fun.

192
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:53,425
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

193
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:55,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll be tabling then too.

194
00:13:55,246 --> 00:14:00,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have a table all set, all reserved and everything?

195
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:02,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I assume so.

196
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

197
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:11,854
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, I think we're going to discuss more about the event this week.

198
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:18,855
[SPEAKER_04]: because we were just like more can more prioritizing the winter preparedness event last week.

199
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,958
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have more details and more organization about it.

200
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:26,961
[SPEAKER_04]: This in the coming days.

201
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:28,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.

202
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:33,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So last year, all of the tables were outside.

203
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:44,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the tree raffle and the, there were like children's activities and stuff that were, was happening inside.

204
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:51,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so when you say outside, you mean outdoors, not like outside in the hall.

205
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:53,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, like actually outdoors.

206
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:56,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there are like, there were like food trucks that were there.

207
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:57,787
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too cold.

208
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,128
Yeah.

209
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:00,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year was cold.

210
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you went last year, Natasha?

211
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:11,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not really last year, because I don't remember the extravaganza.

212
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:14,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I was here, yeah.

213
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:19,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so you're saying is that this year it's going to be outside, Brenda?

214
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:26,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the plan, unless this year is bad and then they'll move it in or something, but yeah.

215
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:34,630
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be like the seaport, freezing cold, and then we're going to have to have hot chocolate, because if not... They had free hot chocolate last year.

216
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:39,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh, I don't know what this weather.

217
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:42,504
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an early event too, right?

218
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:43,884
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like at 4.30.

219
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 4.30 to 6.30.

220
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:47,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

221
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:51,047
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not too bad.

222
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:02,252
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think Catherine was talking about doing arts and crafts in our room.

223
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,447
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you know, okay, perhaps thing.

224
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,567
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I don't know.

225
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:11,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if, you know, our, our office will be.

226
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:19,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Our tabling or, you know, if there'll be stuff out outside, but like said, we'll probably.

227
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps we'll get more information about it this week.

228
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:27,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like it would be so cool to do something like that outside.

229
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:29,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

230
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:45,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I talked with Marie Cassidy briefly about because Medford Family Network usually does like an arts and crafts activity inside about doing some sort of like gingerbread house decorating thing.

231
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:55,121
[SPEAKER_01]: With like, you know, some little educational things about here are things you can do to your house and or electrify Medford.

232
00:16:55,141 --> 00:17:02,164
[SPEAKER_01]: But we hadn't hadn't solidified anything yet, so that that's a good reminder that I should reach back out to her about that.

233
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:08,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it says here on the thing at Medford City Hall.

234
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is rain date Thursday, December 5th.

235
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,630
[SPEAKER_02]: 2024 430 to 630.

236
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:19,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so they won't be moving it inside.

237
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,111
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just be moving the date.

238
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:26,575
[SPEAKER_02]: If the 1st for the official, I think it says Wednesday, December 4th, like.

239
00:17:27,335 --> 00:17:31,918
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, so it looks like there's going to be a lot of, like.

240
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:36,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Vendors as well, so, yeah, it's outside.

241
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:45,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other events coming up.

242
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:51,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

243
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:52,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

244
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for this year that's... Maybe one later, like December 14th.

245
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:00,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget what it was.

246
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:05,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to consult the county.

247
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:22,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the only other thing that I have coming up for electrified Bedford is, um, we're doing an event at the library on January 16th.

248
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,904
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another month out even.

249
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:35,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's just going to be, uh, a thing, you know, another thing, introducing people to electrify Medford, if they want to come and talk to coaches right there.

250
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:48,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the pumpkin smash that was on November 2nd, um, was actually a really well attended event.

251
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:58,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised at how many people came through there and how, um, like engaged they were.

252
00:18:58,257 --> 00:19:03,661
[SPEAKER_01]: People were like really coming over to the table and talking with us for a long time while their kids were playing with stuff.

253
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:09,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a good group of people to be talking to about this sort of stuff.

254
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:10,527
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

255
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:14,584
[SPEAKER_06]: What time is the event on the 16th?

256
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:15,485
[SPEAKER_06]: The January 16th event?

257
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:15,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

258
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:18,928
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 7 to 8 at the library.

259
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:49,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do you want to move on to city updates?

260
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:56,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.

261
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:58,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

262
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:00,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for electrify Medford, we've had.

263
00:20:00,414 --> 00:20:07,899
[SPEAKER_01]: 92 people sign up and so far, 26 of them have been coached.

264
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:10,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Um.

265
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:18,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, oh, I applied for the national, sorry, the Mass Save Community First Partnership.

266
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:27,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is like a 3 year program where we would work really closely with national grid to do outreach about the massive program.

267
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:31,822
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really just kind of an extension of what we're already doing with electrify Medford.

268
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:35,966
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would allow us to get monthly updates from them.

269
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:41,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Including data about, like, measures that have been installed in Medford.

270
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:45,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we can kind of see our impact a little bit better.

271
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:53,403
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll also be able to do bill inserts in people's energy and gas bills.

272
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:58,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that's something that we get so we can move forward.

273
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:02,070
[SPEAKER_01]: We should hear probably in January if we did.

274
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:10,567
[SPEAKER_01]: One additional thing there, small business outreach is a part of it too.

275
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:22,218
[SPEAKER_01]: So I talked with our economic development planner and she would be willing to put in some hours doing outreach to small businesses about Mass Save too.

276
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:25,861
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would become part of the Electrify Medford program too.

277
00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:38,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, oh, the electricity aggregation program.

278
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:44,601
[SPEAKER_01]: So letters went out to residents about the new pricing that starts with their December billing cycle.

279
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:52,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had a lot of calls, mostly people already on the aggregation who think they have to sign up again.

280
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:57,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the record, they don't have to sign up again if they're already on the aggregation.

281
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:01,090
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just get the new pricing automatically.

282
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:09,773
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have come across some people who heard about it and wanted to switch and were on competitive suppliers.

283
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:15,335
[SPEAKER_01]: One person was paying $0.28 per kilowatt hour.

284
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:19,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new pricing for the aggregation is $0.14.

285
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:24,498
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were paying double what they could get for the aggregation.

286
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:38,274
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time we come across someone like that, I'm really horrified, but I'm glad that we're doing this outreach in this program so that they can save some money.

287
00:22:38,294 --> 00:22:48,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I submitted Medford's Green Communities annual report.

288
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:55,941
[SPEAKER_01]: To the state Department of energy resources, so this is for municipal.

289
00:22:56,882 --> 00:23:01,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Building and vehicle use, so it's just municipally owned buildings and vehicles.

290
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:12,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and our total energy use is down 19% from our 2009 baseline, which is when we started those reports.

291
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Um.

292
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:27,108
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we weather normalize that, so like if the weather were the same essentially as it was in 2009, it's only a 14.5% reduction.

293
00:23:27,348 --> 00:23:38,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really just because winters have been warmer that it's down, it's the difference between the 14.5 and the 19% there.

294
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:46,603
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's good progress.

295
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:59,430
[SPEAKER_01]: We had promised for green communities, we have pledged to reduce our energy use by 20%, so we haven't hit our 20% pledge yet, but we are so close.

296
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:13,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Energy Committee had a meeting last Wednesday, and they're looking to add two new members.

297
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:22,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had some people already apply through the boards and commissions website.

298
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:30,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, the boards and commissions application form, but if, you know, anybody who might be interested.

299
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:35,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely send this along so that they can sign up.

300
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,268
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a process where they.

301
00:24:40,822 --> 00:24:50,091
[SPEAKER_01]: They put they put through the application and then we talk with them and then we would like, recommend people to the to the mayor and then the mayor would appoint them.

302
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:54,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me drop in the chat.

303
00:24:55,736 --> 00:24:57,338
[SPEAKER_01]: The link to that, uh.

304
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Form the application form for the boards and commissions page.

305
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:12,205
[SPEAKER_01]: The energy committee was also interested in starting a zero waste Medford initiative.

306
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:19,330
[SPEAKER_01]: There was someone from the community at their last meeting who came in, who was very enthusiastic in talking to them about it.

307
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:23,211
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've gotten very interested in this.

308
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:40,995
[SPEAKER_01]: They were talking about potentially setting up like swap events, doing a campaign to get restaurants not to use like black plastic containers, which aren't recyclable, fix-it clinics, electronics recycling.

309
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:43,036
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all stuff that's happening kind of

310
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:50,823
[SPEAKER_01]: here and there and they're wanting to sort of like organize it more to get the word out more and do more of these things.

311
00:25:54,246 --> 00:26:03,314
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's something that you're interested in getting involved in, I would definitely make sure to keep you, to connect you with them more.

312
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're also interested in developing

313
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:30,056
[SPEAKER_01]: After the wildfire smoke, they were really interested in developing some more air quality communications to send out to people, like some quick, easy to understand tips and then like a link to the purple air maps that show like real time where the air quality is bad.

314
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:33,357
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see if it's bad in your neighborhood at the moment.

315
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:49,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, they were thinking, you know, as well as like for droughts and heavy rainfall and snowfall and other extreme weather, it would be good to have like tips like that already prepared, because we didn't really have anything like that to send out that day.

316
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:59,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've reached out to Catherine and Mary Ann to see what the Board of Health has for any of these topics.

317
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:05,490
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like they get some communications from the state, but that might not necessarily be

318
00:27:09,953 --> 00:27:13,877
[SPEAKER_01]: pinpointed or targeted to things quite that exactly.

319
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:18,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have to follow up on exactly what that might look like.

320
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:27,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that that's something that people would be interested in or that would be useful to people?

321
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:46,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think anybody would pay attention to it?

322
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:53,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, to be honest.

323
00:27:58,068 --> 00:28:02,009
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you guys doing when the smoke was so bad?

324
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:04,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you like look stuff up online or?

325
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:11,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in all honesty, my mom like,

326
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:16,368
[SPEAKER_02]: made all of us wear masks, obviously.

327
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:21,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, no, we just didn't, like, we didn't air out the house.

328
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:22,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we just, like, kept it closed and stuff.

329
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:31,037
[SPEAKER_02]: She didn't really, like, I didn't really, it didn't really affect my area as much, like, on Salem Street.

330
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:31,997
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that bad.

331
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:38,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody on your areas was worse, but here it wasn't that bad.

332
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:41,563
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, going out with masks was one.

333
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:43,258
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing we did.

334
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:46,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty bad.

335
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:55,741
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was like, because I remember I was like, kind of, I could physically see like, there was like the fog and stuff.

336
00:28:56,921 --> 00:29:00,302
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, and then I like looked it up.

337
00:29:00,402 --> 00:29:05,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just said, like, there were forest fires in like, the New Hampshire area.

338
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:11,885
[SPEAKER_04]: But after that, like, what can you really do other than just like wear the mask and

339
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,375
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.

340
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:32,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, they have tips for like, depending on the air quality in your in your neighborhood, like how long you should spend outside before like, how much you should limit your activity.

341
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:32,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

342
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:44,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they did have that advice we shared in our Facebook group to our community.

343
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:49,739
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially my son, who had asthma.

344
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:51,739
[SPEAKER_08]: So we thought about the people who has asthma.

345
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,880
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you don't really need anything, stay in.

346
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:01,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And like Liz, I was saying, suggest wear masks as you know, if if you need to be out there.

347
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:01,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm hmm.

348
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:14,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you, can you see my screen?

349
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:16,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

350
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:20,968
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the purple air map that I was talking about.

351
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:27,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, and it shows you like the particulate matter in particular, in particular areas.

352
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:37,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so like right now in Medford, it's, it's not bad, but like over here in Arlington right now, it's actually quite bad.

353
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:57,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are like particular like recommendations for like limit your time outside to a certain amount of time based on like this number here or the, you know, what color this is essentially.

354
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:02,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think it's so high in that area specifically?

355
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,716
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.

356
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:09,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like, you know, the surrounding areas are not that bad.

357
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:11,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

358
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:15,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if there's like a house fire or something, right?

359
00:31:16,945 --> 00:31:18,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that in, you said that's in real time?

360
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:23,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's every two minutes that it updates.

361
00:31:23,588 --> 00:31:23,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

362
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:27,509
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is see, oops.

363
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:29,410
[SPEAKER_01]: He zoomed in too much.

364
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,211
[SPEAKER_02]: You use purple air, Brenda.

365
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:36,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the, um, Accuweather.com.

366
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:43,422
[SPEAKER_01]: That that shows the air quality to.

367
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:47,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like, for example, now it says it's fair.

368
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:52,967
[SPEAKER_02]: 34, so the air quality is generally acceptable for most individuals.

369
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:58,970
[SPEAKER_02]: However, sensitive groups may experience minor or moderate symptoms for long term exposure.

370
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it shows, like, the current.

371
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,592
[SPEAKER_02]: An air quality scale.

372
00:32:12,248 --> 00:32:21,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think purple air might have more local sensors than the weather does.

373
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:28,917
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also limited now, so certain neighborhoods in Medford, for instance, have no sensors there.

374
00:32:28,937 --> 00:32:32,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the state had a grant program.

375
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:52,862
[SPEAKER_01]: where you could get a certain number of sensors and then do outreach to ask people to install them in their own homes or outside their homes in particular neighborhoods to try to increase the coverage in the area.

376
00:32:57,585 --> 00:33:07,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it might be if it was if it was something that folks, you know, if it was some sort of link somewhere or something, or even if it was like a robo call that went out.

377
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:13,931
[SPEAKER_06]: About the air quality, and they said, you know, you could check link.

378
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:17,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people might be interested just to see how close things are.

379
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:31,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's first thing in the morning, you know, whether they want to send their kids to, you know, are their kids going to walk to school that day, you're going to throw them in the car and drop them off, you know, that sort of thing.

380
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:38,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you can get down to just where things are worse, you know, it might not be so bad at your house, but up by the

381
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:43,380
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the middle school, it might be a whole, whole different thing.

382
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:49,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's one of those things, 6 in 1, half a dozen of another, I think, you know, just kind of depends on.

383
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:54,036
[SPEAKER_06]: If you got people who need to go out that day or.

384
00:33:56,164 --> 00:34:01,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I was in the hospital during that time, and I was in Melrose.

385
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:05,191
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was actually pretty bad first thing in the morning.

386
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you could smell it in the hospital.

387
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:09,715
[SPEAKER_06]: And I could see it.

388
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:12,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I could just see the haze.

389
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:17,301
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was pretty bad, because I was like, yo, what is that smell?

390
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:21,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, I caught on the news what it was.

391
00:34:21,785 --> 00:34:23,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was primarily in the morning.

392
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:48,933
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah that's when it was was worse or the only time i really noticed it was in the morning this was like like maybe three weeks ago two weeks ago yeah i i remember there was like you're saying stacy there was like a very strong burning wood smell and like a visible smog in the air yep

393
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:52,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.

394
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:57,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was when I left my house, my house, there was a faint smell, but not terrible.

395
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And the closer I drove to work, I was like, it got worse and worse and worse.

396
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:11,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right, Stacey, like people might not just by looking outside know what to expect, sending their kids off, whatever.

397
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:11,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

398
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:26,543
[SPEAKER_06]: especially if you can look ahead to where you gotta go, or, you know, you know what I mean, where you gotta go, where you gotta get to next, how close is it to your own home, and, you know.

399
00:35:26,823 --> 00:35:27,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

400
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:34,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, with climate change, stuff like this is going to happen more often.

401
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:40,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you don't think of wildfires being a particular threat in Massachusetts, but...

402
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it only happened in California, not only in California, but that's what we hear about it most.

403
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:52,362
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's more wildfires and stuff, but yeah, it was, yeah.

404
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:53,982
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

405
00:35:56,703 --> 00:36:02,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes like, um, these are naturally occurring.

406
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:03,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

407
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:07,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually like, it's actually good for the environment.

408
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:09,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

409
00:36:10,506 --> 00:36:16,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, naturally occurring, yes, but because there's been such a drought.

410
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:20,554
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything is really dry.

411
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:22,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when things catch, they just go.

412
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:30,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And with climate change, you're going to have more droughts because hot air holds more moisture into it.

413
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:34,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the hotter the air is, the longer it holds that moisture in.

414
00:36:38,144 --> 00:36:40,848
[SPEAKER_01]: or it has the capacity to hold that moisture in for longer.

415
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:50,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're more likely to have longer periods of droughts and then like a lot of rain coming down all at once instead of it raining every once in a while.

416
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:02,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, on that happy note.

417
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:08,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was just making me think about the kooks who say that, you know, climate change is not a thing.

418
00:37:10,136 --> 00:37:10,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

419
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:15,558
[SPEAKER_02]: You made me, you guys made me think about when I was in Ecuador.

420
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:20,279
[SPEAKER_02]: There was such a drought that there was electricity, like shutdowns.

421
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:23,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was all scheduled every like four hours.

422
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,661
[SPEAKER_02]: We had like no electricity for like four hours.

423
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:28,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like insane.

424
00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:31,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was not fun.

425
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:35,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, it made me feel like I was back in Lebanon again.

426
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

427
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:42,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Climate change is real.

428
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to move on to the tree ordinances?

429
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:56,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

430
00:37:58,855 --> 00:38:00,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yes, excuse me.

431
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:07,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the city council committee of the whole is actually taking this up this Wednesday.

432
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:11,385
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not voting on anything.

433
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:15,308
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just looking at it and just the ordinance isn't discussing them again.

434
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:18,951
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite quite a while since the last time they took it up.

435
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:24,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me drop into the chat.

436
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,658
[SPEAKER_01]: The links to the.

437
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:36,703
[SPEAKER_01]: To that meeting, which has all of the ordinance information in it if people are interested.

438
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:49,128
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, there haven't been any edits since the last time.

439
00:38:49,148 --> 00:38:52,970
[SPEAKER_01]: The energy committee talked about it.

440
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:57,552
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still conversation about.

441
00:38:58,997 --> 00:39:19,676
[SPEAKER_01]: does the city have the resources to be able to manage a tree ordinance, especially a private tree ordinance where there are like permit applications and actually like making sure that people are monitoring to make sure that people are actually doing what they're supposed to.

442
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:23,219
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that's going to be part of the discussion too.

443
00:39:25,854 --> 00:39:35,452
[SPEAKER_01]: But entries Medford is meeting tomorrow night at six o'clock to talk about this and prepare for the committee of the whole meeting on Wednesday.

444
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:46,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And Trees Medford is also working on creating a landmark trees list for Medford.

445
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:57,389
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that some other towns have done where they basically just have a list of like, historically significant or just very old or.

446
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:18,775
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of landmark trees where they'll do like walking tours and things like that just so that there's some awareness of like important trees in the community so that people might be able to like rally around them if there's some threat to it at some point, I think.

447
00:40:21,596 --> 00:40:25,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not related to the ordinance, but that's something else that Trees Medford is doing.

448
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:44,964
[SPEAKER_01]: just a refresher the tree ordinances there's one that focuses on trees in city-owned property and there's one that focuses on trees on private property and then there's one that sets up a committee to oversee that

449
00:40:50,844 --> 00:40:52,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of details in there.

450
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:57,949
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see if you click through into the agenda, there's a lot of details about like.

451
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:07,337
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, permits you have to apply for and fines that you might need to pay for cutting down trees of a certain size and things like that.

452
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:11,882
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about trees, Brenda.

453
00:41:12,182 --> 00:41:14,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the I was talking to the mayor.

454
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:24,407
[SPEAKER_02]: After the event, I saw her like, watering the new trees that were around City Hall.

455
00:41:24,927 --> 00:41:25,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

456
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:26,108
[SPEAKER_02]: And um,

457
00:41:27,228 --> 00:41:43,677
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah so she said that there was like a few like that were like planted around like medford so if we ever see one to like you know there's like the bag there you just put like the water in for us to fill it just in case i wanted to let you guys know

458
00:41:45,018 --> 00:41:50,144
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see a tree, like you guys have water or something like to water it.

459
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:54,570
[SPEAKER_06]: So is it self-watering?

460
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,072
[SPEAKER_06]: So the blue bags just need to be filled with water?

461
00:41:57,092 --> 00:41:58,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

462
00:41:58,374 --> 00:41:58,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

463
00:42:04,777 --> 00:42:05,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an FYI.

464
00:42:05,637 --> 00:42:08,979
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing how much water those things hold, though.

465
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:12,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a new tree in my backyard that we planted this spring.

466
00:42:12,761 --> 00:42:19,925
[SPEAKER_01]: It has taken a lot of water during the drought to keep it alive.

467
00:42:19,945 --> 00:42:26,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of time that I just spend there with a hose filling that bag every single day is great.

468
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:28,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think

469
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:32,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like one, like, you know, like the water gallon.

470
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:36,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like one of those and maybe a little more.

471
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

472
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:40,372
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like a lot more than that, what I'm feeling now.

473
00:42:40,472 --> 00:42:42,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

474
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:45,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the mirror with one whole big one and she filled that thing.

475
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:48,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh my God, just for like one.

476
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:53,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a lot.

477
00:42:57,545 --> 00:43:01,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this drought is not being kind to the new trees.

478
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:14,934
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of those things, though, where you're like, OK, you don't want people watering their lawns, necessarily, because that seems like a waste of water during a drought.

479
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:23,598
[SPEAKER_01]: But trees, because they're like long-term investments, new trees in particular.

480
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:31,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so they need if they need a fighting chance to root and.

481
00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:37,289
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, yeah, definitely.

482
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:47,853
[SPEAKER_06]: When I hear things like that, I always think about, you know, students and community service and, you know, I don't know, maybe it could be a science thing or something where.

483
00:43:48,914 --> 00:43:54,296
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the kids, you know, they get a map of where these trees are and stuff and, you know, they.

484
00:43:55,547 --> 00:43:59,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody bring a jug or two, you know?

485
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:00,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

486
00:44:01,254 --> 00:44:13,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the city has a water truck that they bring around to water the trees, but I don't know if they just can't get to them often enough or what.

487
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:14,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

488
00:44:14,984 --> 00:44:25,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just always think, you know, community service, you know, small ways to do community service and, you know, projects for the kids at school, something to do.

489
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:26,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

490
00:44:27,628 --> 00:44:41,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that way they can get involved with like, like the knowledge of like, like knowing how important it is, especially for, like you said, Brenda, that route that we're going in.

491
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:48,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be really cool if they, like, each, like, next to each tree had, like, a thing about it.

492
00:44:50,636 --> 00:44:51,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know.

493
00:44:51,096 --> 00:44:52,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is.

494
00:44:52,317 --> 00:44:54,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like a little post or something.

495
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:55,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

496
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a thing, yeah.

497
00:44:58,622 --> 00:45:01,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually.

498
00:45:02,064 --> 00:45:03,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is, actually.

499
00:45:03,725 --> 00:45:12,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's even an adopt-a-tree program that people can volunteer to water trees

500
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:15,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what they're thinking of is like trees near your house.

501
00:45:16,753 --> 00:45:22,995
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be easier for you to commit to watering, but that's what this website that I just dropped into the chat.

502
00:45:26,637 --> 00:45:31,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Girl Scout Troop 68137 created this website.

503
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw that.

504
00:45:38,941 --> 00:45:41,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Each bag holds between 10 and 14 gallons of water.

505
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:43,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.

506
00:45:44,614 --> 00:45:45,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why it's hard.

507
00:45:45,774 --> 00:45:48,575
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something you can just like walk up to a tree and water.

508
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:51,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you gotta have a hose that you can get from somewhere.

509
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:52,057
[SPEAKER_06]: That's insane.

510
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:53,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're not kidding.

511
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:55,738
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of H2O there.

512
00:45:56,919 --> 00:45:58,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

513
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,700
[SPEAKER_06]: That's more than a gallon, girl.

514
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:00,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

515
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, well, I don't need to tell you what I heard.

516
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I'm just saying.

517
00:46:06,522 --> 00:46:07,363
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I hear you.

518
00:46:07,423 --> 00:46:08,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

519
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:10,164
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of water.

520
00:46:12,977 --> 00:46:16,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'd be volunteering to do that.

521
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:20,921
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just a little too much water to be carried around.

522
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:29,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's why I was thinking if you were doing something that's near your home, you might be able to run a hose out from your home or something.

523
00:46:29,944 --> 00:46:30,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

524
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:31,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

525
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think at this point, we need to pray to mother nature to, you know, do her thing.

526
00:46:39,743 --> 00:46:42,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's that's insane.

527
00:46:42,564 --> 00:46:44,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

528
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:54,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else for the tree ordinances any questions or.

529
00:46:54,689 --> 00:47:01,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but this stuff is interesting to see if you don't send it to us, Brenda, I don't think people know.

530
00:47:03,335 --> 00:47:06,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless I don't know, or do you get this?

531
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:10,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, trees, the trees, Medford thing.

532
00:47:11,978 --> 00:47:18,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, trees, Medford is a very active group there at a lot of events that I'm tabling out for electrify Medford.

533
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,261
[SPEAKER_01]: They give out lots of trees.

534
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:24,282
[SPEAKER_01]: They just did a big tree distribution thing this fall.

535
00:47:24,302 --> 00:47:25,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.

536
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:36,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a thing on their website where people can request a free tree in the spring to plant in their backyards.

537
00:47:38,053 --> 00:47:54,781
[SPEAKER_05]: That picture looks like it could be in West Medford actually.

538
00:47:56,181 --> 00:47:57,302
[SPEAKER_02]: The one on the tree?

539
00:47:58,018 --> 00:48:04,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the on the adopted tree looks like it could be the bridge there right before the.

540
00:48:05,562 --> 00:48:09,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Rotary either that or mystic river road where the.

541
00:48:11,045 --> 00:48:16,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Basketball courts are, but I don't see any basketball on the other side.

542
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be the other end.

543
00:48:22,731 --> 00:48:25,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have the map of where they put all the trees.

544
00:48:42,534 --> 00:48:45,836
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nothing else about the tree ordinances.

545
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:51,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time we talked a little bit about green jobs.

546
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:55,302
[SPEAKER_01]: And.

547
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:09,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke with our economic development director just to get his suggestions for like how to go about something like this.

548
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:17,173
[SPEAKER_01]: And he suggested partnering with MassHire because they do job fairs and things like that.

549
00:49:17,193 --> 00:49:21,937
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's in contact with them regularly anyway.

550
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now he's talking with them because of the

551
00:49:27,162 --> 00:49:40,836
[SPEAKER_01]: the Anheuser-Busch plant closing down and trying to help those folks get new jobs.

552
00:49:41,257 --> 00:49:44,060
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in pretty regular contact with them.

553
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:57,978
[SPEAKER_01]: If hosting a mass hire job fair is something that we would be interested in doing in Medford, I think that's something that we could pursue with him.

554
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:33,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you think would be useful?

555
00:50:33,814 --> 00:50:35,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think people would be interested?

556
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:39,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.

557
00:50:39,398 --> 00:50:45,661
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it ties in pretty well with my new job.

558
00:50:47,662 --> 00:50:56,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, definitely I can get in contact with him maybe to set up something in the future.

559
00:50:58,519 --> 00:50:59,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Charbel, what's your new job?

560
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:06,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this like financial security community connector.

561
00:51:06,846 --> 00:51:10,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So my new title.

562
00:51:11,489 --> 00:51:14,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this ties in pretty good with that.

563
00:51:19,816 --> 00:51:20,516
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

564
00:51:21,417 --> 00:51:26,061
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested, I could just set up a time for the three of us to talk about it.

565
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:27,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

566
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:41,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually, you know, I'm available to speak like during this time on most weekdays, but I don't know if that will work for him.

567
00:51:41,372 --> 00:51:41,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

568
00:51:41,912 --> 00:51:52,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Sal, I don't think Sal is often available weeknights except for Wednesday nights.

569
00:51:53,178 --> 00:51:56,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you available Wednesday nights at all?

570
00:51:58,689 --> 00:52:02,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's usually when we have our meetings, so I guess not.

571
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:06,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, do you guys have weekly meetings on Wednesdays?

572
00:52:06,868 --> 00:52:07,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

573
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:07,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

574
00:52:08,371 --> 00:52:08,972
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean.

575
00:52:10,687 --> 00:52:22,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you were thinking about, you know, just, you know, having conversation about, you know, something that comes up every now and again, I think you'd, you'd get a pass, I think, right?

576
00:52:23,397 --> 00:52:28,141
[SPEAKER_06]: You miss one, you know, you miss meeting every now and again, you'd probably be able to get a pass.

577
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:29,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

578
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:34,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your meetings usually go until 730?

579
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:38,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Like seven.

580
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:50,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, seven o'clock, but I can like I can take we can have the meeting during During the meeting and then I'll just have somebody catch me up.

581
00:52:51,018 --> 00:52:51,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I can read.

582
00:52:51,538 --> 00:52:53,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can step out.

583
00:52:53,779 --> 00:53:03,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so Well, did you know Brenda that we we changed our our positions I didn't know I

[SPEAKER_02]: liaison now for Haitian Creole with Darlene, and Stacey's the liaison for the, what is it?

586
00:53:41,312 --> 00:53:43,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a liaison, just a community liaison.

587
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:44,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

588
00:53:45,714 --> 00:53:47,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a community liaison.

589
00:53:47,334 --> 00:53:48,295
[SPEAKER_02]: We all changed.

590
00:53:49,135 --> 00:53:52,396
[SPEAKER_01]: What is Tamiya's new focus?

591
00:53:53,117 --> 00:53:53,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Tamiya?

592
00:53:55,544 --> 00:54:00,653
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, Samia is of the young, the youth and families.

593
00:54:03,919 --> 00:54:08,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we each all changed our positions.

594
00:54:09,985 --> 00:54:10,425
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

595
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:17,507
[SPEAKER_01]: So does that mean that you're not directly connected to, because before you were directly connected to different partners, right?

596
00:54:18,327 --> 00:54:23,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one person was working more closely with the Medford family network and stuff like that.

597
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:26,290
[SPEAKER_04]: In different languages.

598
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:35,052
[SPEAKER_04]: We like, we still like, like we still support our liaison counterparts.

599
00:54:37,033 --> 00:54:47,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, if, for example, if Samira, my mom, needs help with, like, any Arabic-related stuff, you know, I can still help with that.

600
00:54:48,021 --> 00:54:58,089
[SPEAKER_04]: But pretty much, it's just under the new grant, they had to restructure our jobs and our, like, our responsibilities, pretty much.

601
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,552
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, bureaucratic stuff.

602
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:04,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

603
00:55:04,294 --> 00:55:04,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

604
00:55:07,149 --> 00:55:17,482
[SPEAKER_04]: But since you bring that up about the mass hire job fair, it would tie in well with what my new responsibilities entail.

605
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would be great.

606
00:55:24,574 --> 00:55:30,941
[SPEAKER_04]: If Catherine won't mind if I missed a meeting just to, you know, like, set something up.

607
00:55:32,543 --> 00:55:35,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

608
00:55:36,147 --> 00:55:38,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we could just do something from like 7 to 7 30 or something on a Wednesday.

609
00:55:41,912 --> 00:55:42,973
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of times, yeah.

610
00:55:42,993 --> 00:55:44,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too late for you?

611
00:55:45,014 --> 00:55:45,735
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

612
00:55:45,835 --> 00:55:48,937
[SPEAKER_01]: On Wednesdays, we're at City Hall until 7.30 anyway.

613
00:55:49,417 --> 00:55:50,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

614
00:55:51,058 --> 00:55:52,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

615
00:55:52,379 --> 00:55:54,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you both be at City Hall?

616
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:58,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget.

617
00:55:58,303 --> 00:55:59,043
[SPEAKER_04]: What's his name?

618
00:56:00,765 --> 00:56:02,746
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Sal DeStefano.

619
00:56:02,766 --> 00:56:08,210
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the economic development planner and he's out of my office.

620
00:56:09,053 --> 00:56:10,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you.

621
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:10,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

622
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:12,599
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

623
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,301
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

624
00:56:15,383 --> 00:56:15,964
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

625
00:56:17,627 --> 00:56:20,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so I'll email him and you sure about.

626
00:56:21,605 --> 00:56:22,485
[SPEAKER_01]: just set something up.

627
00:56:23,186 --> 00:56:37,452
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, there are existing resources out there that we could pull together to just, you know, have this list of resources that could be shared out to people, whether that's in a flyer or on social media or whatever.

628
00:56:37,472 --> 00:56:46,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also maybe have a, like a physical job fair at some point.

629
00:56:46,976 --> 00:56:47,957
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be interesting.

630
00:56:47,977 --> 00:56:49,858
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be perfect.

631
00:56:49,998 --> 00:56:50,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

632
00:56:55,708 --> 00:57:08,276
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm obviously more interested in the green jobs part of it, but I think Sal and probably you Charbel would be wanting to open it up to more things than just green jobs for these resources.

633
00:57:09,517 --> 00:57:19,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, like we just need, uh, just need like more, I guess, awareness on how people can

634
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:26,238
[SPEAKER_04]: get like, you know, good paying jobs and get the skills for it as well.

635
00:57:26,278 --> 00:57:31,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, green jobs or, or whatever, it's all relevant, you know.

636
00:57:40,343 --> 00:57:45,385
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's all that I had on my, we had on our agenda here.

637
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:48,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else that folks wanted to talk about today?

638
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:56,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

639
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I circle back on what you guys were talking about the job fair?

640
00:58:06,644 --> 00:58:10,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Charbel, if you do have that meeting, can I get a little information?

641
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:19,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Because me and Darlene were kind of brainstorming not too long ago about having a job fair in the community.

642
00:58:19,251 --> 00:58:29,197
[SPEAKER_08]: But we were kind of like focusing it more on the migrant, you know, and because there are a lot of them are really

643
00:58:30,392 --> 00:58:31,573
[SPEAKER_08]: My phone fell off my hands.

644
00:58:31,793 --> 00:58:34,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

645
00:58:34,675 --> 00:58:46,364
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them are having issues when it comes to trying to land a job, like interview problems, and the employers are kind of like really tough on them too.

646
00:58:47,422 --> 00:59:03,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe if we could kind of like talk to the employee, that's what we were brainstorming during our meeting, the Haitian Method Task Force, to like have a person that would go out and kind of say, okay, how do you, you guys, like, what do you feel about hiring immigrants?

647
00:59:04,051 --> 00:59:13,357
[SPEAKER_08]: And then two, how lenient is the interviews part with them, you know, because of the limited of English,

648
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:21,043
[SPEAKER_08]: So they could kind of give them a slack in a sense, you know, because some of them it's like, OK, interview.

649
00:59:21,444 --> 00:59:26,268
[SPEAKER_08]: And they kind of give them like a really big question.

650
00:59:26,788 --> 00:59:27,689
[SPEAKER_08]: What is your strength?

651
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:28,850
[SPEAKER_08]: What is your weakness?

652
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:32,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And these people sometimes certain vocabularies they don't understand.

653
00:59:32,373 --> 00:59:33,594
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like really hard.

654
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:38,638
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they just brush them off and say, OK, come back when your English is a little better.

655
00:59:38,738 --> 00:59:42,321
[SPEAKER_08]: So if somebody could like talk to them in that sense.

656
00:59:42,863 --> 00:59:49,187
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if that's your job, Charbel, somebody, a spokesman, you know, to kind of talk to them.

657
00:59:49,908 --> 00:59:51,209
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely connected.

658
00:59:52,450 --> 01:00:03,377
[SPEAKER_04]: But what do you think of just like you come into the meeting since, Natasha, you work for, you work with Mass Hire, right?

659
01:00:04,218 --> 01:00:07,040
[SPEAKER_08]: No, well, I don't work directly with them.

660
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of bring people to them.

661
01:00:10,342 --> 01:00:11,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I work with ABCD.

662
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:12,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

663
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:13,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

664
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:30,041
[SPEAKER_08]: They affiliate in a sense of me, the students that I have, I kind of like, um, send them their way so they could register and get a job quest ID so they could start learning how to get into the system and basically get trained to get ready for work.

665
01:00:30,782 --> 01:00:31,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

666
01:00:32,423 --> 01:00:33,224
[SPEAKER_08]: In that sense.

667
01:00:35,025 --> 01:00:39,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, I still don't, do you think it would be like a good idea if you, if you,

668
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:42,215
[SPEAKER_04]: join the meeting as well.

669
01:00:42,815 --> 01:00:43,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I don't mind.

670
01:00:45,256 --> 01:00:49,417
[SPEAKER_04]: You can gather something or you can add something from your experience.

671
01:00:50,577 --> 01:00:53,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

672
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:55,259
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be from 7 to 7.30, I'm not sure.

673
01:00:55,539 --> 01:00:59,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's fine.

674
01:01:00,641 --> 01:01:06,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it would be this week based on people's schedules right now.

675
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:09,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and it probably wouldn't be next week.

676
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:10,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Next week's holiday.

677
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:18,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, we're still there at City Hall until 730, but... What?

678
01:01:20,017 --> 01:01:24,239
[SPEAKER_03]: November... Is it going to be 20-something?

679
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute.

680
01:01:27,421 --> 01:01:28,942
[SPEAKER_08]: City Hall don't get out early?

681
01:01:28,962 --> 01:01:32,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I've heard.

682
01:01:32,343 --> 01:01:35,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they'll tell us on the day of that we can get out early.

683
01:01:37,018 --> 01:01:37,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

684
01:01:50,785 --> 01:01:51,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my goodness.

685
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:53,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but you know what?

686
01:01:53,606 --> 01:01:56,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do it after the winter extravaganza.

687
01:01:56,368 --> 01:02:01,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that should work.

688
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,332
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like that's the first Wednesday that

689
01:02:07,033 --> 01:02:08,174
[SPEAKER_01]: That people will be free.

690
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:12,577
[SPEAKER_04]: No way, exactly what time the extravaganza is.

691
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:14,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 4.30 to 6.30.

692
01:02:14,518 --> 01:02:15,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.

693
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:19,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, that should work.

694
01:02:23,284 --> 01:02:23,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

695
01:02:25,386 --> 01:02:28,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Natasha, remind me again what you do with ABCD.

696
01:02:32,328 --> 01:02:36,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the title is Employment Services Advisor.

697
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:39,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, why are they trying to make it so fancy?

698
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:40,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a career advisor.

699
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:41,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Just say that, will you?

700
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:48,872
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the title they give me.

701
01:02:48,992 --> 01:02:49,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, OK.

702
01:02:50,672 --> 01:02:51,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

703
01:02:51,672 --> 01:02:53,152
[SPEAKER_01]: This is right up your alley, though.

704
01:02:54,213 --> 01:02:54,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

705
01:02:55,193 --> 01:02:55,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

706
01:02:56,699 --> 01:03:04,961
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially as we're looking to like pull together lists of resources and stuff, Natasha, you're going to be a resource for that.

707
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:06,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

708
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

709
01:03:12,503 --> 01:03:12,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

710
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:14,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

711
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll reach out to Sal about that tomorrow then.

712
01:03:18,365 --> 01:03:25,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, anything else about brain jobs or about jobs in general?

713
01:03:34,258 --> 01:03:36,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else folks want to talk about today?

714
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:53,342
[SPEAKER_01]: For our next meeting, I have a list of possible future meeting topics here that I've just been jotting down as we, from month to month.

715
01:03:55,864 --> 01:03:57,425
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was green giveaways.

716
01:03:59,866 --> 01:04:05,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Having each member come with a list of suggestions, is that something that folks could do for the next meeting?

717
01:04:09,772 --> 01:04:11,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Like suggestions that we give away?

718
01:04:12,634 --> 01:04:21,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like things that we could give away at events and things that are not terrible for the environment.

719
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:24,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard.

720
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,534
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really hard.

721
01:04:25,554 --> 01:04:28,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent you my favorite.

722
01:04:28,377 --> 01:04:31,619
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been like, it's crazy.

723
01:04:32,881 --> 01:04:40,867
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's not easy, especially like something that it's like, not as expensive for us to be able to like, get to.

724
01:04:41,468 --> 01:04:46,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the thing is, there is, but it's like, on the pricier side of it.

725
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:48,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have a budget, I'm assuming.

726
01:04:48,854 --> 01:04:48,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So

727
01:04:53,063 --> 01:05:00,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we talked about this a little bit last time, but I was not ready with a list this time and I didn't think anybody else would be.

728
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:08,997
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna give like seed packets away.

729
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:10,779
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

730
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something?

731
01:05:13,381 --> 01:05:14,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed packets?

732
01:05:14,743 --> 01:05:15,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed.

733
01:05:15,123 --> 01:05:17,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, seed packets.

734
01:05:17,425 --> 01:05:18,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect, seed.

735
01:05:21,102 --> 01:05:23,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, looking up green giveaways.

736
01:05:26,224 --> 01:05:28,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I came up with, I think I put that there.

737
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:31,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I also did the fans.

738
01:05:32,486 --> 01:05:33,726
[SPEAKER_02]: The fans is a good 1.

739
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:36,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda, the.

740
01:05:37,408 --> 01:05:39,688
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like that 1 will go.

741
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:48,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to add that to the agenda for next time?

742
01:05:48,892 --> 01:05:49,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

743
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:54,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at some down.

744
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:58,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might see if the tree warden can come.

745
01:06:00,238 --> 01:06:05,082
[SPEAKER_01]: To talk about the where the ordinances is that something that you're interested in.

746
01:06:08,045 --> 01:06:11,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's such a cool job title to.

747
01:06:11,308 --> 01:06:12,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Tree boarding.

748
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:25,896
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had something jotted down last time about under transportation topics about bus routes.

749
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:28,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?

750
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Or route, the bus route.

751
01:06:33,582 --> 01:06:35,403
[SPEAKER_01]: The 94, yeah, the new bus routes.

752
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:37,825
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one that's being taken out, right?

753
01:06:40,507 --> 01:06:40,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

754
01:06:40,908 --> 01:06:44,651
[SPEAKER_01]: I shared the flyer with information about that, right?

755
01:06:45,651 --> 01:06:45,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

756
01:06:45,891 --> 01:06:47,513
[SPEAKER_01]: About the changes to the routes.

757
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:56,915
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we want to discuss about that?

758
01:06:56,935 --> 01:07:18,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see.

759
01:07:18,346 --> 01:07:19,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

760
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:19,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

761
01:07:22,022 --> 01:07:25,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I was debating when I was looking at the minutes from last time.

762
01:07:25,845 --> 01:07:45,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we can sign the petitions, but is there anything more we can do as a way to sort of like spread the word or maybe try to like delay this?

763
01:07:49,419 --> 01:07:55,082
[SPEAKER_01]: This has already gone into effect, right?

764
01:07:55,102 --> 01:07:59,164
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going into effect next year, right?

765
01:08:00,465 --> 01:08:03,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought it went into effect today.

766
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,768
[SPEAKER_01]: What, the redesigning?

767
01:08:07,729 --> 01:08:08,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, OK, sorry.

768
01:08:09,009 --> 01:08:12,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody I know had said something to me about the new bus.

769
01:08:12,091 --> 01:08:14,112
[SPEAKER_01]: He was surprised by the new bus route today.

770
01:08:17,715 --> 01:08:19,796
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume that that's what he was talking about.

771
01:08:19,816 --> 01:08:19,856
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

772
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:22,979
[SPEAKER_04]: On the flyer says like late 2025.

773
01:08:23,019 --> 01:08:23,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OK, late 2025, early 2026.

774
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:23,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

775
01:08:23,959 --> 01:08:27,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I obviously was not paying enough attention to that.

776
01:08:27,682 --> 01:08:29,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so maybe I don't know if

777
01:08:48,695 --> 01:08:52,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Our transportation director would be able to come to the meeting.

778
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:00,584
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe I can ask him for some more information about what.

779
01:09:02,045 --> 01:09:06,329
[SPEAKER_01]: He thinks people can do for the about the new bus routes.

780
01:09:08,731 --> 01:09:11,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he has been advocating for Medford.

781
01:09:12,013 --> 01:09:17,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Bus routes himself in statewide meetings that he goes to and stuff, but.

782
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:28,683
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are ways that people can get involved more directly other than what we put out on the other than what I sent you about the that flyer.

783
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:31,586
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be good to know.

784
01:09:31,606 --> 01:09:36,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I emailed you about that.

785
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:37,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Brenda.

786
01:09:37,832 --> 01:09:46,380
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as, like, I asked you if there was available and, like, other languages so people can see it.

787
01:09:47,622 --> 01:09:53,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the only thing I had was a paper version of that flyer that somebody dropped off in our office.

788
01:10:11,179 --> 01:10:11,740
[SPEAKER_01]: But it might be.

789
01:10:14,946 --> 01:10:17,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we dropped them off in our office, actually.

790
01:10:18,267 --> 01:10:19,248
[SPEAKER_01]: But that might be something.

791
01:10:19,328 --> 01:10:24,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that worthwhile to for for you to translate and and get out to people?

792
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:29,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

793
01:10:30,812 --> 01:10:43,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would be it would be good to even like, for example, the winter extravaganza where there's a lot of people there, maybe have that so that people can be aware of it.

794
01:10:44,252 --> 01:10:45,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And give it out.

795
01:10:49,634 --> 01:11:00,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let me let me I said, let me let me talk to the transportation director here and see if he had if there are other things that he's aware of that we can be sharing with people too.

796
01:11:01,297 --> 01:11:01,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

797
01:11:04,038 --> 01:11:06,439
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that way, we can also post it on our Facebook.

798
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:09,439
[SPEAKER_02]: That has to be obviously, like, accurate.

799
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:10,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

800
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:11,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

801
01:11:14,751 --> 01:11:23,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, unless folks have other things that they want to get on the list for the next meeting.

802
01:11:23,213 --> 01:11:27,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that might be it.

803
01:11:35,475 --> 01:11:38,076
[SPEAKER_04]: So motion to adjourn the meeting.

804
01:11:45,744 --> 01:11:47,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're seconding it, Lizette?

805
01:11:47,505 --> 01:11:49,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I second it.

806
01:11:49,866 --> 01:11:51,967
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what my peace sign was.

807
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:54,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have the audio up.

808
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:58,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Then all in favor, say aye.

809
01:12:00,372 --> 01:12:00,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

810
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:04,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

811
01:12:04,374 --> 01:12:06,675
[SPEAKER_07]: And aye.

812
01:12:06,795 --> 01:12:11,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Lizette, why are you giggling?

813
01:12:13,425 --> 01:12:14,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Natasha's so funny.

814
01:12:15,006 --> 01:12:15,826
[SPEAKER_02]: We all went, aye.

815
01:12:15,846 --> 01:12:17,947
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, I like a pirate.

816
01:12:18,427 --> 01:12:18,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

817
01:12:18,607 --> 01:12:19,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
