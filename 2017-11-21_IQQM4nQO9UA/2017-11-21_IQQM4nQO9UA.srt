[SPEAKER_10]: The 35th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will be called to order.

00:00:09,428 --> 00:00:10,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Clerk, call the roll.

3
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:33,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Chairman Marks.

4
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:34,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

5
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Five present, two absent.

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Please rise to salute the flag.

7
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:50,367
[SPEAKER_09]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

8
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:57,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to suspend the rules, um, to take papers under suspension.

9
00:00:58,371 --> 00:00:59,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Del Russo, all in favor?

10
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:06,063
[SPEAKER_10]: paper 17-seven five one offered by council and night be resolved.

11
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:22,120
[SPEAKER_10]: City solicitor in conjunction with the chief of police and building commissioner provide the council with a draft ordinance establishing safety standards, regulating the commercial display and storage of firearms, ammunition and firearm accessories in the city of method.

12
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:23,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Council night.

13
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:25,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

14
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:33,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Looking back in the newspaper over the summer, I think if we all recall a police standoff up in Saugus along Route 1.

15
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:40,938
[SPEAKER_12]: And what happened was the gentleman had made his way into a Dick's Sporting Goods up in Route 1 and got his hands on some firearms, Mr. President.

16
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,758
[SPEAKER_12]: And this resulted in a police standoff.

17
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:44,539
[SPEAKER_12]: They closed down Route 1 for a number of hours.

18
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Recently in our community, we were very lucky to open up a Dick's Sporting Goods.

19
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:52,543
[SPEAKER_12]: And this Dick's Sporting Goods is a great, great facility.

20
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:57,990
[SPEAKER_12]: However, they do sell some questionable material that I don't personally support, which would be firearms, Mr. President.

21
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,277
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is in no way, shape, or form an attempt to push back on people's Second Amendment rights.

22
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, what it is is an effort to regulate,

23
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,784
[SPEAKER_12]: The safe storage and sale and display of firearms, ammunition, and firearm accessories in the city of Medford.

24
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,826
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the cat's out of the barn.

25
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:16,846
[SPEAKER_12]: The horse is out of the barn.

26
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,088
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a facility here in the community that's selling firearms.

27
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:25,313
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's incumbent upon us as a council to take all the steps that are necessary to ensure that we maintain that the community remains safe.

28
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:35,460
[SPEAKER_12]: So, with that being said, Mr. President, I bring this forward as a conversation starter, a spot for us to jump off from a launching pad, if you want to call it that, for us to start this discussion and have this conversation.

29
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:40,466
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support the measure and move for approval.

30
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:44,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

31
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Second by Councilor Falco.

32
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:48,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Del Russo.

33
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:52,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I support this as a conversation starter, Mr. Chairman.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,000
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion.

35
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,181
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

36
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:57,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

37
00:02:58,102 --> 00:02:58,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed?

38
00:02:59,323 --> 00:02:59,984
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it.

39
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:01,926
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion is adopted.

40
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:06,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the city clerk.

41
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Second motion.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any other papers?

43
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:15,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

44
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,122
[SPEAKER_10]: So papers in the hands of the city clerk.

45
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:20,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's three more.

46
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:22,323
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got 17, seven 52 under suspension.

47
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:35,844
[SPEAKER_10]: And the suspension 17-752, administration refund taxpayers in the city council, November 14th, 2017.

48
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:43,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Who offered this?

49
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:47,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

50
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:52,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

51
00:03:52,316 --> 00:04:04,983
[SPEAKER_12]: This paper here is paper 17752, which reads, be it resolved the city administration refund taxpayers all convenience fees incurred during the current fiscal year as a result of the online payment of tax bills issued by the city.

52
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:11,127
[SPEAKER_12]: And be it further resolved that the city administration take the necessary steps to eliminate or assume such fees going forward.

53
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:18,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, I've run into several situations, gotten several phone calls, bumped into people that have attempted to pay their property tax bills online.

54
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:24,417
[SPEAKER_12]: And when they go in there to pay their property tax bill, they're assessed a convenience fee.

55
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:27,099
[SPEAKER_12]: The last one that I heard was upwards of close to $50, Mr. President.

56
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:30,234
[SPEAKER_12]: And that doesn't sound too convenient to me.

57
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:31,515
[SPEAKER_12]: We're sitting here in the community.

58
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:32,915
[SPEAKER_12]: We're asking robocalls to go out.

59
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:34,516
[SPEAKER_12]: We're asking things to get posted on the website.

60
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:37,438
[SPEAKER_12]: We're asking people to utilize technology more and more.

61
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,138
[SPEAKER_12]: We shouldn't be charging them to do it.

62
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,640
[SPEAKER_12]: We should be encouraging it, not discouraging it, Mr. President.

63
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,623
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm asking that the administration look into this and to take the appropriate steps to either waive the fee, assume the fee, or eliminate the fee.

64
00:04:55,008 --> 00:05:06,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a little hour after my name, so I'm the last person that wants to, um, uh, see people taxed, especially when they get, uh, tax that come up from behind them.

65
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:23,695
[SPEAKER_03]: So this could be construed at that, but I would want to hear an explanation about this, uh, from, uh, either the treasurer or Alicia, uh, Nunley, um, on what our expenses are and how this is something that can, if not,

66
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:27,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't want to see people pay $50 every just to pay a bill.

67
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:36,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I certainly, uh, uh, know that at some point, uh, to provide services, we need revenue to do that.

68
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:51,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so I support this, but I'd like it, uh, uh, to, uh, amended that, uh, we get an explanation in person from, uh, the appropriate person from the, uh, city administration regarding these financial matters.

69
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:52,796
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's,

70
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:57,109
[SPEAKER_03]: amenable to the presenter of the resolution.

71
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:00,612
[SPEAKER_03]: In the spirit thereof.

72
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:02,614
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly have no problem with that, Mr. President.

73
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:06,677
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're going to take a vote, I want it to be an informed vote and I want everybody behind the rail to be comfortable with it.

74
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:17,485
[SPEAKER_12]: With that being said, I'd be happy to even withhold the request until we have the presentation from the treasurer or the financial director, whatever the council feels comfortable with.

75
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:21,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I just think this is an opportunity for us to get... They can be simultaneous.

76
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:24,615
[SPEAKER_03]: most things move.

77
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,196
[SPEAKER_10]: So you want to refer it to the subcommittee?

78
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,357
[SPEAKER_12]: We can do that too.

79
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:32,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Audit and finance?

80
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:33,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that?

81
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:35,939
[SPEAKER_10]: No, let's move it along.

82
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:37,959
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fine.

83
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:42,241
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, my motion is to have it passed, but you know, go to the administration.

84
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:49,223
[SPEAKER_12]: But if the council has questions, then I have no problem going along with whatever it is that it will take to make sure that this comes to fruition.

85
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:54,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So the motion on the floor is by Councilor Knight to have this submitted to the city administration.

86
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:55,846
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

87
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:57,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Opposed?

88
00:06:57,287 --> 00:07:00,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you amend it, Councilor?

89
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:00,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I amended it, yes.

90
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to ask that we have an in-person explanation of why this is going on.

91
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:08,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we send it to the administration?

92
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:09,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Simultaneously.

93
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,400
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

94
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:13,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

95
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:14,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed?

96
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:15,922
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it.

97
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:17,123
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion is adopted.

98
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:18,658
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency.

99
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:31,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President papers in the hands of the clerk offered by council of marks be resolved that the sidewalk in front of one 10, one 12 Warren street be replaced in the interest of public safety approval motion for approval.

100
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:32,169
[SPEAKER_10]: All's in favor.

101
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed?

102
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,930
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it.

103
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,211
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion is adopted.

104
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:36,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

105
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:38,294
[SPEAKER_10]: We resolved that the electronic,

106
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:46,900
[SPEAKER_10]: speed sign be placed after Winthrop Circle heading toward West Medford Square on High Street in the interest of public safety.

107
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Move approval, Mr. President.

108
00:07:49,282 --> 00:08:07,835
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may, Mr. President, as your well-hearing, I'm sure, has been reported to you in why you put this on there, is that we have certainly a lot of hasty driving there that has resulted in a number of bad situations, Mr. President, and I think that would be a good place for that monitoring.

109
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:15,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It serves to quell and remind people of their own behaviors, especially since there's been a citywide adjustment in the speed limit.

110
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:16,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

111
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:17,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor on the motion.

112
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:18,845
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor.

113
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:19,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

114
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:19,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed.

115
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:21,266
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it.

116
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:22,506

120
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed.

121
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,147
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it, the motion is adopted.

122
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:42,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to revert back to regular order of business.

123
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:44,092
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

124
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:44,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

125
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposed?

126
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:45,794
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it.

127
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:57,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 17-750 offered by Vice President Mox be resolved that the construction work on Harvard Street from Main Street to Benton Road be discussed.

128
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

129
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:45,967
[SPEAKER_10]: We all received several emails regarding the national grid is determined that a gas main on Harvard Street for Main Street to Benton Road will be replaced starting Monday, November 13th, which was yesterday lasting four weeks, taking place Monday through Friday from 7 p.m.

130
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,068
[SPEAKER_10]: to 5 a.m.

131
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:49,250
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the original request.

132
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:58,042
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, since then, uh, there's been some, uh, emails going back and forth, uh, that the work will now take place during the day.

133
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:05,086
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, I have yet to get confirmation from chief Sacco who needs to make that decision.

134
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:17,853
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, uh, the concerns I've heard from residents, and I know many of my colleagues have, uh, was really the lack of notification of residents in the area and the lack of input from any residents.

135
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:25,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Some residents found out through finding a flyer on the street that this work was going to take place.

136
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:44,757
[SPEAKER_10]: And many homes in the area that directly abut this and whose bedroom windows are located within 20 feet from potential construction at night naturally would have some grave concerns about sleep disruption during a four week span.

137
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's a number of residents

138
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:51,165
[SPEAKER_10]: here that would like to speak on the issue, Mr. President.

139
00:10:51,865 --> 00:11:09,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I would ask that this project be duly notified through Reverse 911 in the city, Mr. President, alerting residents when this work will take place, how long the work will take, and when it will be done.

140
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:16,204
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's going to be during the day or the evening is extremely important, Mr. President, that residents are aware of this.

141
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So at this time, I'd open the floor.

142
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,793
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone from the direct abundance would like to speak.

143
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:26,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

144
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:27,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

145
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:28,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

146
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:29,660
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Angela Ferrari.

147
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at two 15 Harvard street and my unit is 19.

148
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:42,590
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm directly on Harvard street and most certainly the entire area right up outside my door and bedroom will be affected by this.

149
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:45,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as you mentioned, we learned of this.

150
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:52,555
[SPEAKER_01]: by a flyer, this flyer, being taped to my outside door on last Friday afternoon.

151
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:55,276
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was literally four days ago.

152
00:11:56,357 --> 00:12:08,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew nothing about this until then, and clearly I don't think any of the other condo owners at the Lincoln Kennedy School complex learned about it either until we got these notices.

153
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:11,944
[SPEAKER_01]: This opens up, obviously, a whole plethora of issues.

154
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:14,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only the

155
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:20,323
[SPEAKER_01]: original idea of working overnight, which still has yet to be resolved.

156
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:36,370
[SPEAKER_01]: So we as residents don't know if we're going to be disrupted overnight or in the day, but clearly we all object to the overnight work because that means none of us will get any sleep for four or five weeks, whatever this work is slated to be done by.

157
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:44,446
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if it does go in the daytime, and I understand that they need to upgrade this work.

158
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:45,890
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that it needs to be done.

159
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:59,433
[SPEAKER_01]: What they didn't do is get the residents input as to how that's going to affect us by way of the fact that we are a private association, we are a private property.

160
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:07,399
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens is a lot of times we get individuals cutting through our property to turn around and go the alternate way.

161
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,364
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't take into effect that the workers will be there extremely early in the morning

162
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:23,050
[SPEAKER_01]: to with big trucks digging or needing to park or causing dust up or issues for people that might have health problems.

163
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:29,154
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that was discussed or even brought to the property owners and gotten input by.

164
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:31,976
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of families in these units.

165
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:40,302
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly both people who work and people who have families are going to be disrupted not only with needing to reroute

166
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,522
[SPEAKER_01]: going in and out of the homes or our parking spaces.

167
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:50,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition to that, it's over the holidays.

168
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:53,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they've chosen a very difficult time of year.

169
00:13:54,148 --> 00:14:01,833
[SPEAKER_01]: It's holidays, it's, you know, now we potentially could be faced with weather issues that could delay the construction from being finished.

170
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:08,777
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're looking potentially going into like, you know, mid to late December, if that's the case, you know, if we do have some weather issues.

171
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:27,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that, I think there's a part of this notice that says temporary or permanent restoration of disturbed areas will be in accordance with the town ordinance.

172
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:38,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So that doesn't give us a lot of faith that the street being ripped up is going to be returned to the current state that it's in.

173
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:52,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself, as a resident, had a problem with a manhole cover that was constantly banging, and I raised the issue and complained about it for the last year and a half, almost two years.

174
00:14:53,165 --> 00:15:03,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And less than a month or two ago, I finally got that manhole cover fixed, and I finally was able to start getting a good night's sleep with it banging constantly.

175
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:07,209
[SPEAKER_01]: What this is now saying is it's going to rip up the entire street over again.

176
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:16,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And when is, you know, then we're dealing with when are these original, the original state of the road going to be back to normal, somewhat normal.

177
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:31,968
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, recently over the summer, the intersection of Main Street and Harvard that had had terrible, you know, bumps and divots in the road right by a business on the corner there, finally got repaired.

178
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:34,149
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that's going to be all ripped up.

179
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,369
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it was a number of concerns.

180
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:44,677
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the disruption, the noise, the lack of notice, we're not confirmed when they're going to do the work, whether it's day or night.

181
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:54,894
[SPEAKER_01]: potential delays in case there's weather, and then of course what the road status is gonna be back to normal if and when it's gonna finally be back after they rip it all up.

182
00:15:55,474 --> 00:16:03,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we all have to make individual appointments for National Grid to connect our service again.

183
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:14,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like a number of steps that is going to take place according to their notice, and I don't know if you've received a copy of the notice, which if you haven't, I'd be happy to give you mine or make a copy.

184
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:14,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

185
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:25,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be important for you to have that so that you can refer to it.

186
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:37,221
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I, for one, understand and I'm happy that they're doing an upgrade, but I think that it just completely could have been handled more appropriately and gotten input from the residents.

187
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:40,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for hearing from me.

188
00:16:40,184 --> 00:16:40,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

189
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:41,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?

190
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:41,946
[SPEAKER_01]: No?

191
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:42,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

192
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:42,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

193
00:16:46,392 --> 00:16:48,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, your name and address for the record.

194
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:51,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, my name is Christopher Donovan, 4 Lorraine Road, Bedford, Mass.

195
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:58,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one question, are we getting a new sidewalk up at Winthrop Ave through this mitigation money through National Grid?

196
00:16:59,044 --> 00:17:02,387
[SPEAKER_11]: To go back to the prior incident, we did discuss that.

197
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:08,793
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of the 200 feet that we were told that Winthrop Street will now have sidewalk throughout the district.

198
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:10,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's national grid is going to take care of that.

199
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:11,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a national grid.

200
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was ever source.

201
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,969
[SPEAKER_05]: That was already set.

202
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that pod set something?

203
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,311
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is incinerating and we'll be, that'll be part of next week's meeting too, I believe.

204
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could see this part of the MOU.

205
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was in the MOU.

206
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:23,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

207
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all.

208
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:24,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

209
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:25,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

210
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:28,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else?

211
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:36,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kind of waiting to be the last one speaking because I'm the newest president of Medford.

212
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:40,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not the Dillard's, but we moved in at the end of July.

213
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.

214
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you.

215
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:44,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Address of the record.

216
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:45,232
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Rod Marden.

217
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:49,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm at 215 Harvard street, unit 17.

218
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:51,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the honored.

219
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:58,175
[SPEAKER_08]: neighbor, Evangeline, who gave a thorough, comprehensive presentation of the problems.

220
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:16,523
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing that I would like to add to that is, standing here, I'm very fortunate to be standing here today because when I moved in, for about five weeks in a row, I was not able to sleep because of that manhole cover.

221
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:19,144
[SPEAKER_08]: and my health deteriorated.

222
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:22,525
[SPEAKER_08]: My arrhythmia got much worse.

223
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:27,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to get an emergency appointment with Dr. Felton's office.

224
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:39,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And my concern when I saw this flyer and it was shoved into my door, I had a few questions.

225
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:42,395
[SPEAKER_08]: One that were addressed by Angela and also

226
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:47,816
[SPEAKER_08]: how much coordination was there between National Grid and the City of Medford.

227
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:53,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if there was coordination with Chief Sacco in his department regarding this.

228
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:57,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Many unanswered questions as to what's going to happen.

229
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:07,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I was very glad to see that things were changed to the daytime, but I'm not sure whether the change happened because of

230
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:12,408
[SPEAKER_08]: some pressure from emails or whether there was any sort of effort and coordination with the city.

231
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,669
[SPEAKER_08]: We have no information about that.

232
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:20,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think before work begins, there should be coordination with the city about this.

233
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:31,637
[SPEAKER_08]: One other point, this is a street that's used by school buses and I have a concern of what's going to happen with the rerouting of those school buses.

234
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:32,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh,

235
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:39,434
[SPEAKER_08]: If the work was done over the summertime, there would probably be a lot less disruption to the local public schools here.

236
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:45,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that should be considered, unless there's an emergency situation with the gas leak that they have to explore.

237
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:54,665
[SPEAKER_08]: The flyer gave some hint that they have to drill some holes to find out where the pipe is.

238
00:19:55,486 --> 00:20:00,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering whether they're doing anything about whether the report of the gas leak or not.

239
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:07,455
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so many questions that have been left unanswered that the residents don't have the answers to.

240
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:16,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that we need to take a look, as Medford residents and as our elected representatives,

241
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:25,560
[SPEAKER_08]: make sure that this work proceeds in the healthiest and best way possible for the residents and for the city.

242
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:26,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

243
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:27,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

244
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:35,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, for one, I know that this council has worked very hard with making sure that our, uh, uh,

245
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:40,209
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, or natural grid never saw us and other utilities do what they need to do.

246
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:41,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So I find this disheartening.

247
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,551
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be the first time I'll see that, that announcement.

248
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:48,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this is, uh, something that we'll, we'll get on as soon as we can.

249
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:52,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for coming out tonight and, uh, and sharing your opinions.

250
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:52,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

251
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:54,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we have a motion.

252
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:57,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any other, anyone else?

253
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:57,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

254
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:08,598
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?

255
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:10,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Rick Giganti, Hobbit Street, 139.

256
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:14,627
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a ton of things for us.

257
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:17,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God for the local coffee shop.

258
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:19,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise I wouldn't have even known about this.

259
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Tony.

260
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:30,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on the other side of the world on this one because I'm on the other side of main street, but that's going to impact me tremendously, whether it's night or day.

261
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:42,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, if you don't know Harvard street, and I'm sure you guys all know, uh, me trying to get out of my driveway at a normal day is a task, let alone trying to do something like this.

262
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:51,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if it's at nighttime, I have an issue because I have rental property and, and unfortunately I've been trying,

263
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:53,833
[SPEAKER_06]: very desperately to try to get parking permits.

264
00:21:54,333 --> 00:22:00,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't get a parking permit because Harvard street doesn't have parking permits, but where I'm located, they're saying I can park on the street.

265
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:03,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, I can't park on the street, not in front of my house.

266
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't have a sign that says no parking both sides.

267
00:22:07,603 --> 00:22:12,887
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we ended up doing with my tenants is they're parking up in front of two 15 on the opposite side.

268
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:14,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if they're going to rip up the road,

269
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:16,276
[SPEAKER_06]: How are we going to park?

270
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are we going to park?

271
00:22:17,357 --> 00:22:22,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I get a parking permit for these tenants of mine, which are two, two females that work.

272
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:29,187
[SPEAKER_06]: One works at, um, Leahy clinic on, on, uh, she's a nurse and she does 12 hour shifts.

273
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:32,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's getting in at seven and leave it at seven or six.

274
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes she does overtime.

275
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:36,494
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I have another one that works at Raytheon who does overtime.

276
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:38,395
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to have an issue with parking.

277
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:42,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Great things were mentioned here tonight.

278
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:48,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Weather's going to be coming up, four weeks, daytime, nighttime, school buses.

279
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:50,527
[SPEAKER_06]: We see it all.

280
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind just even the fire apparatuses.

281
00:22:55,071 --> 00:22:56,992
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a major state road.

282
00:22:57,573 --> 00:23:01,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I was told when I tried to get a sign for just stopping

283
00:23:03,277 --> 00:23:14,241
[SPEAKER_06]: 200 feet or 100 feet from the red line, from the red light in the four corners, so that I could get out of my driveway on a red light, figuring maybe they could stop here on red.

284
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:20,023
[SPEAKER_06]: That was against all the laws and rules because it's a state road.

285
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:24,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this going to be a state-funded project?

286
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:27,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we gonna get anything, be in Harvard Street, be in the state road?

287
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:29,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Has that come up?

288
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:34,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was an issue when I went up against a traffic commission before on Havard Street.

289
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,878
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of issues.

290
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm looking around.

291
00:23:39,642 --> 00:23:40,964
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a lot of people here.

292
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:45,250
[SPEAKER_06]: And for Havard Street, you know the traffic on Havard Street and you know the people on Havard Street.

293
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:53,268
[SPEAKER_06]: There should be a lot more people up here other than just four or five of us talking, especially with the impact that this is going to have.

294
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:58,991
[SPEAKER_06]: School buses alone, it's a big safety issue, and you're coming into holiday season.

295
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:13,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, try to push it out a little bit more and get some more people, some more thoughts, but there needs to be some more action for this particular construction to go on.

296
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:15,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

297
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:15,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

298
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:21,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

299
00:24:21,698 --> 00:24:22,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations everybody.

300
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the concern I have is, you know, what Harvard is a very, very busy street.

301
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:30,066
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of traffic every day.

302
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:31,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a plan?

303
00:24:31,828 --> 00:24:39,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Has anybody seen a plan on what they would do for alternative routes for people to take, you know, regardless of school buses or,

304
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:45,514
[SPEAKER_07]: construction trucks with the green line going up, the concrete trucks that you see every day going up there.

305
00:24:47,115 --> 00:24:47,715
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a concern.

306
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:49,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the traffic going to go?

307
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:56,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Because right now, Bonner Avenue, tremendously overcrowded in the mornings and the afternoons.

308
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:58,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Golden Avenue, all those areas.

309
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to affect people driving around in the area trying to make it back and forth to work.

310
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:09,137
[SPEAKER_07]: make it back home, and I just wish that before they started this.

311
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:23,106
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, I don't agree with the time frame when they're going to do it, because based on some of the previous work that they've done, it hasn't been broom cleaned and has to be re-repaired.

312
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:26,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Winter time is going to be tough.

313
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:34,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I might as well just put sand back in the holes there because the concrete or whatever they put there, I don't think it's going to make it through the winter season.

314
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,676
[SPEAKER_07]: The most important thing, I think, is the people that have stores.

315
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:41,898
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a busy season for them.

316
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:46,820
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the Oasis restaurant, you have Buccelli's, you have Ata's Pastries, you have LaCasha's.

317
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,762
[SPEAKER_07]: This is when a lot of people make their money because of all the different parties they have for the holiday season and everything.

318
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:57,944
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I don't even know that these people, the store owners, were made aware of this.

319
00:25:59,745 --> 00:26:02,907
[SPEAKER_07]: The most important thing is, where are you going to get your cannolis for Thanksgiving?

320
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:05,047
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm more concerned about, Mr. Theodore.

321
00:26:05,408 --> 00:26:06,028
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

322
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:09,149
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, I would expect more from National Grid.

323
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,472
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know you guys will do what you have to do to get things squared away.

324
00:26:14,652 --> 00:26:14,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

325
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:16,272
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.

326
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:23,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I think this is that we just had a Committee of the Whole meeting with the project being done with Eversource.

327
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:31,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the biggest things we talked about is, as we move forward with that, before we approve it, is having more of community input and making sure we have community meetings.

328
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:35,879
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I find this disheartening that this has happened again to this neighborhood.

329
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I know that you have champions behind this rail that are going to make sure that we do what we can right now.

330
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:43,721
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. Vice President, if you can.

331
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:48,128
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to thank the residents for coming up tonight.

332
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:55,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, where, where this is a non emergent job, um, I know it's dealing with a gas line.

333
00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:02,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I think it's crucial that, uh, the city, and I'm not going to point the finger at, uh, the utility company.

334
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:07,494
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the city that represents the residents of this community, not the utility company.

335
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:11,260
[SPEAKER_10]: The city should have a clerk of the work assigned to the project.

336
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:19,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Residents should be aware of exactly who in the city is the contact person for every project that's taking place in this community.

337
00:27:20,363 --> 00:27:32,567
[SPEAKER_10]: And if a traffic plan, as Mr. D'Antonio mentioned, is out there, everyone should be aware if they're going to be closing off certain sections, if they're going to be diverting traffic.

338
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:35,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone in that area should be aware, Mr. President.

339
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:37,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have yet to hear anyone that's aware of

340
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:39,946
[SPEAKER_10]: anything that's going on with this project.

341
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:50,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, the fact that it is not an emergency project, to me, the city should be sitting down with National Grid and talking about mitigation.

342
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,570
[SPEAKER_10]: What can we do?

343
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,432
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we realize lines get older and so forth and need replacement.

344
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think anyone doubts that.

345
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:07,916
[SPEAKER_10]: But on behalf of the residents of this community, we should be able to sit down with these utility companies and request certain things, Mr. President.

346
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:14,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know on Harvard, you know, we've talked about broken sidewalks at Nauseum, up and down Harvard Street.

347
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:17,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't it be nice to be able to go to the utility company and say, you know what?

348
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:24,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of the inconvenience, we would ask that you replace, you know, 30 different sidewalks on Harvard.

349
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:27,867
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, to me, that's a no-brainer.

350
00:28:28,868 --> 00:28:32,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Those discussions should be happening between the city and the utility companies.

351
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,671
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think all they're doing is approving things and no follow-up.

352
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,217
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're seeing it time and time again.

353
00:28:40,778 --> 00:28:55,887
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask, Mr. President, in the form of a motion that a clerk of the works be assigned to this project immediately and the residents be notified who in the city is going to be the contact person for this particular project.

354
00:28:56,247 --> 00:29:07,894
[SPEAKER_10]: The traffic plan be provided also, Mr. President, whether it's on the website so city residents can view it or that the direct abutters receive a copy of the traffic plan

355
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:13,243
[SPEAKER_10]: And also that, going forward, that the city discuss mitigation.

356
00:29:13,823 --> 00:29:25,626
[SPEAKER_10]: When a project of this size comes in and it's going to be an impact to the community through traffic, through noise, through disruption of everyday quality of life, as was mentioned, you get the holidays coming up.

357
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:37,169
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, these are the things that we should be using as leverage with the utility companies to get them, Mr. President, to do curb to curb, as we've talked about, restoration.

358
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:46,209
[SPEAKER_10]: rather than just restoration in the area where they're digging, new sidewalks, new handicapped ramps, you know, improved lighting, whatever it might be.

359
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:52,094
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is the time to hit up these multibillion-dollar companies on behalf of the residents of this community.

360
00:29:52,434 --> 00:29:56,177
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I would offer those three initiatives, Mr. President, in the form of a motion.

361
00:29:56,197 --> 00:29:57,598
[SPEAKER_10]: The Vice President Okay.

362
00:29:57,638 --> 00:30:05,845
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion, Vice President Obama, that we amend that, amend the paper that we forwarded, the mitigation,

363
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:10,779
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, the clerk of the works traffic plan and the clerk of the works, right?

364
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:12,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Neighbor communications.

365
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,482
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the four pieces I believe that we need to send to the administration.

366
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amended.

367
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:19,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

368
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:22,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So second council night, all in favor.

369
00:30:23,085 --> 00:30:23,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

370
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:24,346
[SPEAKER_05]: All opposed.

371
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:26,207
[SPEAKER_05]: The ayes have it.

372
00:30:28,528 --> 00:30:29,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

373
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:29,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

374
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice president.

375
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:32,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

376
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:35,231
[SPEAKER_10]: We received the correspondence, um, from the,

377
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:41,206
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, city solicitor, uh, to mayor Burke regarding council resolution 16-73.

378
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:57,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, this was a resolution I offered well over a year ago that the city and the city, the city council and their wisdom, uh, asked that, uh, an ordinance be drafted up by the city solicitor who I am very grateful, uh, took the time to draft this up.

379
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:04,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I would like to send this particular paper to the subcommittee on business and economic development.

380
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:07,215
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, just for the edification of the viewing audience.

381
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, this is a consumer protection ordinance.

382
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:13,436
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, if I could just read it briefly, Mr. President, please do.

383
00:31:13,696 --> 00:31:32,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, it says dear mayor Burke and the above caption resolution, the city council requested that the city solicitor draft an ordinance requiring any retail or wholesale business, which is made aware of an incorrect store price that has the ability to communicate with the customer through the offering of a store savings card,

384
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:41,884
[SPEAKER_10]: or other method be required to refund or credit all customers who purchased an item marked incorrectly.

385
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:54,491
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes on to say the code of mass regulations already requires prompt payment be made to customers who have been overcharged and the store owners maintain a price accuracy and missing price report.

386
00:31:54,951 --> 00:32:00,935
[SPEAKER_10]: This takes it one step further, Mr. President, and I think it really is a consumer-friendly ordinance

387
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:05,889
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not aware of anyone in this state that has an ordinance like this.

388
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:15,051
[SPEAKER_10]: But once a store is on notice of an incorrect price, you can go up and talk to the store manager and they'll reimburse you the difference.

389
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:18,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Some stores will even give you the item for free.

390
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:21,212
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'm asking, Mr. President, we take it one step further.

391
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,153
[SPEAKER_10]: In this day and age with technology and store cards and

392
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:51,948
[SPEAKER_10]: credit and debit cards and everything else, that store, once they're on notice that a price is incorrectly marked, they should be able to go through that day's worth of receipts and see who else bought that item and maybe wasn't savvy enough to pick up on the incorrect price, and then they reach out to the customer and either credit their debit card or their charge card or send them out the difference in the meal, Mr. President, on the difference

393
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:54,705
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, and price that was incorrectly marked.

394
00:32:55,345 --> 00:33:11,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Steve, uh, Champoli, who's our, uh, director of seal of weights and measures, uh, reviewed this language and, uh, his, I don't want to quote him, but he said he can't wait to get this enacted so he can start enforcing it, Mr. President.

395
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:20,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I would ask that it be sent to the subcommittee for, uh, it's due diligence and vetting and, uh, eventual passage.

396
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:25,904
[SPEAKER_10]: of this very important consumer-friendly protection ordinance, Mr. President.

397
00:33:25,924 --> 00:33:26,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, Mr. Chairman.

398
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:28,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

399
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:31,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the resolution is very important.

400
00:33:31,587 --> 00:33:32,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Consumers appreciate it.

401
00:33:32,748 --> 00:33:41,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to, on the motion, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo that this go to subcommittee on economics.

402
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:42,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Business and economic development.

403
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Business and economic development.

404
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record.

405
00:33:47,716 --> 00:33:49,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushion Street.

406
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:57,944
[SPEAKER_00]: On that vein of overcharging consumers, I'd like to share a story that happened to me.

407
00:33:58,024 --> 00:34:05,870
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought $20 worth of gasoline a few weeks back in this city at a gas station.

408
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,913
[SPEAKER_00]: And mathematics, I sort of know.

409
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:12,775
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was 7.5 gallons.

410
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:17,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it should have been 8 gallons because it was exactly

411
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,341
[SPEAKER_00]: $2.49 and nine-tenths per gallon.

412
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:24,063
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking there should be eight gallons for $20.

413
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:29,985
[SPEAKER_00]: And I questioned the attendant who poured the gas into my vehicle.

414
00:34:30,926 --> 00:34:33,847
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I just work here, you know.

415
00:34:34,747 --> 00:34:41,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess what I'm trying to say is people should probably pay attention at the gas pumps.

416
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:45,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought gas to the following same station weeks later.

417
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:50,488
[SPEAKER_00]: and it came out exactly eight gallons at $2.50 a gallon.

418
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:51,709
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was corrected.

419
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:57,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about the weights and measures, if that was just an abnormality or what.

420
00:34:58,271 --> 00:34:59,231
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I wanted to say.

421
00:34:59,371 --> 00:34:59,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

422
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:11,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe at the end of the meeting, Mr. Cassin, if you could give us the name of that company that we can actually, not publicly, but ask the weights and measures director, Mr. Champoli, to look into that.

423
00:35:11,255 --> 00:35:13,856
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what his job is, to make sure those,

424
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,488
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand, but I'm a sub-Method graduate.

425
00:35:17,528 --> 00:35:20,930
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to be so-called Mr. Belgian rat.

426
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave a note.

427
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,772
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will keep an eye on that station.

428
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:25,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

429
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

430
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:37,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, just if I could, just for the education of the viewing audience, Mr. Champoli is responsible for all scales in the community, as well as pumps.

431
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:43,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look at any of the gas pumps, it should have a dated sticker on it that shows that it was re-inspected

432
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:48,413
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, not only for accuracy, but also the octane level, uh, is checked at the pumps too.

433
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:52,635
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you provide that information, uh, we can definitely add that to his list.

434
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:53,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

435
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:56,296
[SPEAKER_05]: They also do the oil trucks and all our cabs too.

436
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, okay.

437
00:35:58,397 --> 00:36:01,938
[SPEAKER_05]: On that, on that motion, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

438
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:06,305
