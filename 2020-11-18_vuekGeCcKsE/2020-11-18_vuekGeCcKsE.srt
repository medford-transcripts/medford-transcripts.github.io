1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:02,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, happy birthday all around.

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:07,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's wonderful.

3
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:22,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so that's why we have to make sure we're ending in the appropriate time because the necessity for me, she lives in Maryland and I have to call while the little boys are awake and singing happy birthday and all the rest, so.

4
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, very nice.

5
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:26,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's see, who else is here?

6
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:33,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do want to say that I just got off the phone with the superintendent who's stuck in traffic.

7
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:43,220
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's going to try and join via her phone, but I'm just letting everybody know that update.

8
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:44,681
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

9
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:48,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just taking a look whether Tanya is here yet.

10
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:49,504
[SPEAKER_08]: She is.

11
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:50,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I am here.

12
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:52,065
[SPEAKER_08]: You're so good.

13
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:53,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

14
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:53,666
[SPEAKER_08]: And Alex?

15
00:00:54,947 --> 00:00:55,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm here.

16
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:59,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have permission to change my name, sorry.

17
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:01,909
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, Alex Roy, I'm here.

18
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:02,630
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, great.

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,151
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, terrific.

20
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:06,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jenny is here.

21
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:13,439
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mia Mustone, who's the other member, said she could not come.

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Paul here yet?

23
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:17,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet.

24
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:23,929
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to be joining us just as someone else, another committee member, today since Mia couldn't make it.

25
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:25,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

26
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:27,982
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to read this long thing.

27
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:30,183
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me find out where it went.

28
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:31,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

29
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:38,167
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you would, today is November 18th.

30
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:39,848
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just after four o'clock.

31
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,329
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a meeting of the curriculum subcommittee.

32
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:49,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Please be advised that on Wednesday from four to 530, there will be a curriculum subcommittee meeting held through

33
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:52,093
[SPEAKER_08]: remote participation via zone.

34
00:01:52,614 --> 00:02:01,520
[SPEAKER_08]: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss a plan for incorporating disability awareness into daily instruction as a pilot program in the Metro Public Schools.

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12th order submitting certain provisions of the open meeting law,

36
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:15,712
[SPEAKER_08]: 301 paragraph 18 in the governor's March 15, 2020 order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place.

37
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:20,956
[SPEAKER_08]: This meeting of the Medford School Committee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

44
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:22,217
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there was a change to that which I'm going to find in a second.

45
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:24,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll repeat that.

52
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:31,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to have Joan Bowen and Susanna Campbell present, but we're going to start off with a different presentation first by our SPEDPAC.

53
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,311
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, today,

54
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:40,368

55
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:44,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, we've been booted because there's another meeting.

56
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,331
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much for all of that.

57
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:54,574
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could ask, as is our custom, if everybody could rise so we could say the Pledge of Allegiance.

58
00:04:56,841 --> 00:05:07,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with justice and liberty for all.

59
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:08,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

60
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Jenny, could I ask you to take the roll?

61
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

62
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:17,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham here.

63
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:18,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Member van der Kloot?

64
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:19,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Here.

65
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And Member Mustone is absent.

66
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:25,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And instead, Member Ruseau?

67
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:28,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here, hello.

68
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:29,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, hello.

69
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:30,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

70
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:52,250
[SPEAKER_08]: So today we're gonna start off with a presentation that I don't know who's the lead person, but Tanya and Alex are going to start off with a presentation at the beginning of our meeting here so we can review the work that they've been doing over the years as part of the PAC.

71
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex will be the lead.

72
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:56,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to present.

73
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:58,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to share my screen with you.

74
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:03,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I didn't hear that.

75
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:04,528
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

76
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:13,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

77
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:15,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody is seeing the presentation.

78
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:16,213
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Alex Lorik.

79
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a Medford resident.

80
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:28,342
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a mother of a sixth grader who has intellectual disabilities and is receiving special education services at McLean.

81
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:36,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And together with Tanya Sullivan, I am the co-chair of Medford CPAC, at least for the next two hours, because we have elections tonight.

82
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:38,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Alex, it's kind of cut off on the left-hand side.

83
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:39,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

84
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:43,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anybody else, it should say disability is natural.

85
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:45,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see everything?

86
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I see ability is natural.

87
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking it's cut off a little bit.

88
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:54,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine is cut off as well.

89
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:56,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I can.

90
00:06:56,741 --> 00:07:00,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see this?

91
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:03,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's cut off on the left a little bit.

92
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:06,504
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really nothing I can do.

93
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:07,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's better.

94
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:07,744
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

95
00:07:08,664 --> 00:07:09,404
[SPEAKER_03]: That's much better.

96
00:07:09,444 --> 00:07:10,604
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

97
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:10,784
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

98
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:11,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

99
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:11,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

100
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:12,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

101
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:23,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we want to present to you about the advocacy that CPAC did regarding the adoption of a disability awareness curriculum at four public schools.

102
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:26,285
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been working on this for a while.

103
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:35,194
[SPEAKER_02]: We are advocating for roughly 20% of my four public school students who receive some kind of special education services and for their families.

104
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,036
[SPEAKER_02]: We have started

105
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:50,647
[SPEAKER_02]: This advocacy at school level, particularly at Roberts and at Brooks, but it did become clear that we need a top-to-bottom approach and we need central administration commitment for this.

106
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:52,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So we met with central administration.

107
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:54,929
[SPEAKER_02]: We presented CPAC several times.

108
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:03,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do feel that we were heard and there was progress, particularly in September, 2018, when the special education subcommittee was created.

109
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:10,988
[SPEAKER_02]: The focus that year, 2018-2019, was on disability awareness curriculum and on community participation.

110
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:16,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the ideas that I'm presenting today emerged from those discussions.

111
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:27,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, in terms of progress, Susanna Campbell created and delivered in May 2019 disability awareness training for teachers and for administration.

112
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:27,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do hope that

113
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:34,619
[SPEAKER_02]: this initiative is going to be the foundation for the Disability Awareness Curriculum for our students.

114
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:54,727
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose for a Disability Awareness Curriculum is teaching students to develop understanding and respect for fellow students with physical, sensory, and developmental disabilities by providing accurate, age-appropriate information that highlights the unique perspectives and strengths people of all abilities bring to our community.

115
00:08:55,852 --> 00:09:01,656
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want to emphasize the fact that such a curriculum will have benefits for all students.

116
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:06,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It will engage their natural curiosity.

117
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,721
[SPEAKER_02]: It will open their minds to different perspectives.

118
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:10,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It will teach them kindness.

119
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:18,448
[SPEAKER_02]: The students will gain knowledge about a range of disabilities and chronic medical conditions.

120
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,551
[SPEAKER_02]: They will develop understanding and respect through hands-on learning.

121
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:32,924
[SPEAKER_02]: it will expand the perceptions of how all people are different and they are the same and students will become more comfortable talking and reaching out to peers with disabilities.

122
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:38,328
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be less likely to engage in or tolerate bullying and they will learn how to be allies.

123
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,393
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the implementation, obviously we are parents and this is going to be done by

124
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:48,703
[SPEAKER_02]: teachers and other educational professionals.

125
00:09:50,204 --> 00:10:05,171
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are ideas that emerge over many discussions, and we do hope that the final product is going to look something like this, particularly in terms of intentionality and in terms of consistency across schools and across grades.

126
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:10,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are hoping that this is going to be again a district-wide initiative.

127
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:14,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Teaching units are going to be created for a variety of disabilities.

128
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:31,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly for those conditions that qualify as disabilities under the Social Security Administration, which are bolded in this presentation, but also for other conditions that affect our students, such as asthma, epilepsy, allergic conditions.

129
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:40,863
[SPEAKER_02]: The district is going to identify age and grade appropriate units, meaning that, for instance, a decision is going to be made that the second grade

130
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:58,461
[SPEAKER_02]: all students are going to be exposed to units for blindness and physical disability, for instance, such that by a particular grade, for instance, at the end of the elementary school or the end of the middle school, all students are going to be exposed to all units.

131
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:03,803
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to teach two or three units per grade, potentially as part of the ELA curriculum.

132
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:08,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this will kind of ensure that the students are going to stay with this topic

133
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:13,877
[SPEAKER_02]: for several days in the same way that they are staying with their ELA units.

134
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are going to have time to really work with this topic.

135
00:11:20,784 --> 00:11:24,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Materials for each unit are going to be identified at district level.

136
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,131
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are going to be a reading list.

137
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:30,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Reading materials are going to be available to teachers.

138
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:33,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiction and nonfiction, vocabulary activities,

139
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:38,216
[SPEAKER_02]: There are going to be guidelines for discussions or writing sessions.

140
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:44,039
[SPEAKER_02]: There are going to be hands-on activities, including details about resources available in the district.

141
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:54,765
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, if they are teaching a unit on blindness, the teachers are going to know where they can find some books written in braille so they can demonstrate that and the students can have that experience.

142
00:11:54,825 --> 00:12:01,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if they are teaching a unit on physical disability, they can have access to a wheelchair, and again, the students can have some hands-on experience.

143
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:09,286
[SPEAKER_02]: The materials is going to be presented in a variety of ways, such as videos materials are going to be available for teachers.

144
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:14,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to try to keep students engaged and keep their curiosity going.

145
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:19,590
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, providing examples of famous people that have disabilities.

146
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:28,133
[SPEAKER_02]: In conclusion, introducing a disability awareness curriculum in Medford Public Schools remains a priority for CPAC.

147
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,974
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe that the need is as acute as ever.

148
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:37,847
[SPEAKER_02]: We are really thankful and encouraged that this subcommittee is taking this issue and is addressing this issue.

149
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:40,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And we hope to make meaningful progress.

150
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:43,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

151
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

152
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Alex.

153
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:50,268
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for all your work with the special education pack.

154
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:58,695
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, this is something that I've believed in very firmly and have been part of the discussions in the previous years.

155
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:00,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the year, right?

156
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:01,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

157
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:02,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.

158
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:07,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Having said that now, I think I'm going to turn it over to Joan and or Susanna.

159
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know who's going to take the lead.

160
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:11,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

161
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:13,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Susanna, are you going to screen share?

162
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:19,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'll screen share the presentation.

163
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:20,277
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

164
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:22,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to walk through it, or do you want to walk through it?

165
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:26,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is your creation, so.

166
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:32,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I can start and talk about the course, and then maybe you want to talk a little bit more about next steps.

167
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:33,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

168
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:38,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that I need somebody to make me a co-host, though, so I can share.

169
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,349
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be all set.

170
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:41,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

171
00:13:41,557 --> 00:14:04,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to see if I can hit the present button.

172
00:14:06,865 --> 00:14:08,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, are you able to see that?

173
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:08,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

174
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:23,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is just an overview of the course that I ran the year before last and some next steps that we are hoping to implement this spring.

175
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:34,228
[SPEAKER_06]: So the name of the course that we ran, and we are going to be running again this coming year, or in January of 2021, is Disability Awareness in the Classroom.

176
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:42,866
[SPEAKER_06]: And this professional development offering is currently available on the PD website.

177
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:56,833
[SPEAKER_06]: It's open for registration, and we're hoping to have lots of different people participate, including teachers, but also paraprofessionals, administrators, all staff.

178
00:14:56,973 --> 00:15:04,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that anybody who works in the school environment will really benefit from this training because it's about building a community

179
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:06,395
[SPEAKER_06]: of people who are enlightened.

180
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:10,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's really about the whole school, not just teachers.

181
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,222
[SPEAKER_06]: The dates and times are on this slide.

182
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:19,126
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll begin in January on Thursday afternoons, wrapping up in February.

183
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:21,548
[SPEAKER_06]: The hours are after school.

184
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:34,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to hold this via Zoom or Google Meet, just because I think that given the current climate, that's going to be more feasible and safe at this point.

185
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:54,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So the outcomes for the course are that the participants will learn the history of disabilities in America and the legislation that's been put into place to protect people with disabilities, that they will understand disability bias and the concept of ableism.

186
00:15:54,245 --> 00:16:04,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And ableism is a societal attitude that people who are not disabled are considered kind of the norm

187
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:18,226
[SPEAKER_06]: and that it is more favorable to walk than it is to roll in a wheelchair, that it's better to speak than it is to communicate with a communication device.

188
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:25,972
[SPEAKER_06]: So being able to understand that that's part of society and how to break down some of those beliefs will be part of this course.

189
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:27,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Understanding

190
00:16:28,423 --> 00:16:36,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Disability etiquette so that teachers are able to model and people within our district are able to use proper disability etiquette.

191
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:47,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is things like if somebody is in a wheelchair that, you know, you don't touch their chair, that if you think somebody might need assistance that you ask them if they want assistance, you don't just assume and step in.

192
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:52,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Develop a deeper understanding of what it's like to be a student with a disability.

193
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,032
[SPEAKER_06]: we go through a variety of disabilities in the course.

194
00:16:57,212 --> 00:16:58,814
[SPEAKER_06]: They're listed under number five.

195
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:10,442
[SPEAKER_06]: So we talk about autism, communication, disabilities, blindness, intellectual disabilities, dyslexia, hearing impairment, fine motor issues, and many more.

196
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:17,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it is a little bit controversial to do kind of these

197
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:24,947
[SPEAKER_06]: activities where they give a person an opportunity to kind of experience what it might like to have a disability.

198
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:38,477
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we do this, we talk about what could the teachers or the individuals who are participating really take away from it in terms of what can they understand might help their students to access better when they go through these simulations.

199
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:44,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Number six, we identify literature that has positive representations of

200
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,542
[SPEAKER_06]: persons with disabilities that they can incorporate into their classroom learning.

201
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.

202
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:56,648
[SPEAKER_06]: We identify tools that can be used to break down disability stereotypes.

203
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:10,057
[SPEAKER_06]: The teachers develop lesson plans that target student disability awareness, identification of similarities between students with and without disabilities, acceptance, positive attitudes, uniqueness, and inclusion.

204
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:18,921
[SPEAKER_06]: We identify strategies, accommodations, and modifications that facilitate the participation of students with various disabilities in everyday teaching.

205
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:22,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not just about a certain unit.

206
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:26,565
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that can be incorporated in the content areas consistently.

207
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:32,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And the participants understand why disability awareness is important to teachers and to students.

208
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:39,431
[SPEAKER_06]: So the key curricular concepts are that we want

209
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:48,435
[SPEAKER_06]: are educators to be incorporating positive representations of people with disabilities into their content area lessons.

210
00:18:49,095 --> 00:19:01,058
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether we're talking about a high school social studies teacher or we're talking about a preschool teacher, that they can take these positive representations and work it into their curriculum.

211
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:06,191
[SPEAKER_06]: that they will use universal design for learning during everyday teaching.

212
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:10,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And universal design for learning is learning that helps everybody have better access.

213
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:17,039
[SPEAKER_06]: That we can incorporate anti-ableism language and practices into the content area lessons.

214
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:29,948
[SPEAKER_06]: So that if we are reading a book and there are examples of ableism in the book and you're talking about older students that you can kind of delve into that and have a conversation and clear that up so that

215
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:36,609
[SPEAKER_06]: we're reframing these misconceptions that are related to disability while addressing content.

216
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:48,220
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to build a more inclusive classroom environment where students can see that they are all very similar with or without disability, and that they're also unique in their own ways.

217
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:55,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And to create a community of learners who celebrate differences and support one another in an appropriate way.

218
00:19:56,433 --> 00:20:01,717
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Joan, do you want to kind of take over and talk about our next steps there?

219
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:02,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

220
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:12,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next steps are that, you know, we have the participants complete the professional development course that will be held from January to February in 2021.

221
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:18,549
[SPEAKER_05]: After the completion of the course, we want to pilot

222
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:34,640
[SPEAKER_05]: and recruit those staff members who either participated in the 2019 professional development or this year's professional development to pilot a disability awareness curriculum within our schools.

223
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would work with these individuals.

224
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:42,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be any grade level, any content area.

225
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:46,184
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to try to get as many volunteers as we can to be able to do this.

226
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:54,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once we establish what the curriculum will look like, we want to pilot in the classrooms from March to May 2021.

227
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:56,406
[SPEAKER_05]: We also want this to continue.

228
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:59,067
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want this to be a one and done sort of thing.

229
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:03,488
[SPEAKER_05]: We want it to be implemented and embedded in everyday instruction.

230
00:21:05,168 --> 00:21:16,233
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where we're headed and we feel like this is really valuable for the disability awareness we don't, you know, there are sort of your box curriculum.

231
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:27,913
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the work that the staff and that Susanna has done with the disability awareness course really personalizes it and makes it individualized for our students in Medford Public Schools.

232
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we're headed.

233
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:31,974
[SPEAKER_05]: We're excited for it.

234
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:36,996
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a huge turnout for the professional development in 2019.

235
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:43,699
[SPEAKER_05]: We're anticipating that we will have a large number of faculty and staff members attending this one.

236
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:48,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we will take the next steps and we can update as we go along.

237
00:21:52,446 --> 00:22:03,372
[SPEAKER_06]: If you would like, I could show you a couple of examples of some lessons that were created out of the 2019 course.

238
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:10,516
[SPEAKER_06]: This might help people to kind of understand where this came from and where we might be going.

239
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me just pull one up here.

240
00:22:14,978 --> 00:22:19,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so let's see.

241
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you able to see this okay?

242
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:22,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

243
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:23,470
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

244
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:30,012
[SPEAKER_06]: So this lesson was created by a fifth grade teacher, Ms.

245
00:22:30,052 --> 00:22:32,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Pires, who now has a new last name.

246
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:42,154
[SPEAKER_06]: But she took a book out of my mind, which is something that she was using as part of her ELA curriculum.

247
00:22:42,914 --> 00:22:45,275
[SPEAKER_06]: And this book is focused on a

248
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:55,503
[SPEAKER_06]: intermediate grade student who has a physical disability and is not able to speak.

249
00:22:56,504 --> 00:23:01,246
[SPEAKER_06]: And the students read this as part of their ELA instruction.

250
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:09,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was able to incorporate all of these different elements of the

251
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:20,452
[SPEAKER_06]: curriculum frameworks so that she was addressing her ELA standards while also addressing the disability awareness.

252
00:23:20,472 --> 00:23:27,114
[SPEAKER_06]: So there were essential questions that really helped the kids to discuss disability and to understand more about it.

253
00:23:27,734 --> 00:23:32,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So she had language objectives, the targeted academic language,

254
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:49,290
[SPEAKER_06]: she was also able to go through and talk about student preconceptions and misconceptions of, you know, what is cerebral palsy and what are the preconceptions that students had of those with disabilities and their abilities.

255
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:54,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what was interesting about this particular character is that while she was not able to speak, she was very intelligent.

256
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,053
[SPEAKER_06]: And once she was given

257
00:23:56,643 --> 00:24:05,806
[SPEAKER_06]: the opportunity to communicate with a communication device, it opened up a world where she was able to really express everything that she had been thinking all along.

258
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:08,927
[SPEAKER_06]: So she, you know, Ms.

259
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:17,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Pires went through and made all of these, all of these specific steps in terms of outlining the lessons.

260
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:19,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she also included these

261
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:26,302
[SPEAKER_06]: leading questions that could be used to facilitate conversation or written feedback.

262
00:24:27,762 --> 00:24:42,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you have, we created a drive of all of these different lesson plans so that this way, you know, as teachers are looking for how can they incorporate disability awareness into their

263
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:52,750
[SPEAKER_06]: everyday lessons, they have a drive, and these are from the 2019 course, where these are all different lessons that are based on grade level.

264
00:24:52,770 --> 00:25:04,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have preschool, primary grades, intermediate grades, grades six through eight, nine plus, and we also had unified arts because we had an art teacher participate.

265
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what else is in there.

266
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,889
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had a music teacher, an art teacher.

267
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:21,837
[SPEAKER_06]: So we really can be applying this across all different classes throughout the school day.

268
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:24,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it's really exciting.

269
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the teachers enjoyed it.

270
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that I really enjoyed leading the course.

271
00:25:30,244 --> 00:25:41,828
[SPEAKER_06]: we have a tremendous resource here already that we're going to build upon this year so that when individuals, you know, volunteer to pilot, they'll be in a really good position to have a lot of resources right at their fingertips.

272
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:46,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody have any questions about that?

273
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:59,058
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Suzanne, can you tell me how many teachers took the course the first time and what your hope is for enrollment.

274
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to say that it was about 48.

275
00:26:01,381 --> 00:26:02,062
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time around.

276
00:26:06,536 --> 00:26:14,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, to be honest with you, how many we'll get this year because I feel like people are a little bit saturated and overwhelmed this year in general.

277
00:26:14,904 --> 00:26:16,645
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much that they're juggling.

278
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:25,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope that, you know, we will get, I'm hoping about 15, 20 is kind of like, I feel like a good expectation.

279
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:30,358
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that it's being held via Zoom might be more appealing to some because they can, you know,

280
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:32,734
[SPEAKER_06]: log in from wherever they are.

281
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:46,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the thought would be that we would just continue this the following year so that eventually we would be catching kind of more and more of the individuals so that in the end, we would be giving everybody this coursework.

282
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:49,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

283
00:26:51,064 --> 00:27:00,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that this work that you've been doing is really excellent, you know, and I've loved seeing the lesson plans.

284
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:12,518
[SPEAKER_08]: My only concern is it's possible that a student would go through eight grades and not happen to get any consistent

285
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:18,609
[SPEAKER_08]: discussion from year to year, depending on who this child's teachers are.

286
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's where we need your support, to be honest.

287
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:28,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that, you know, up until this point, it has been, you know, a volunteer basis.

288
00:27:28,795 --> 00:27:36,720
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that that's where Alex and Tanya are coming from, that they want this to be recognized so that then maybe we can identify

289
00:27:37,765 --> 00:27:44,468
[SPEAKER_06]: some different specific topics that would be targeted at each grade level so that we don't have that possibility.

290
00:27:45,108 --> 00:27:55,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to start with a pilot first, but I think that the hope would be that down the road, we can do what Alex said, that in grades one and two, they're covering a couple of specific topics.

291
00:27:55,613 --> 00:28:05,937
[SPEAKER_06]: In grades three and four, it's a couple of different specific topics so that then we are making sure that as kids work through the school system, that they're getting all of these different lessons.

292
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:07,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Jenny?

293
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:28,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Susanna, I think my question is, did we make a conscious decision that we were going to build this incrementally over time instead of purchasing a curriculum that would put in place exactly what you're talking about?

294
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:36,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So it strikes me that the, I heard wonderful things about the professional development, but it strikes me that

295
00:28:37,055 --> 00:29:00,833
[SPEAKER_09]: the output of the professional development was so that people could go off and like build their own stuff, which is okay, but it's not sort of foolproof in that we can't guarantee that we are covering the curriculum in a linked and progressive fashion if every teacher is off independently creating.

296
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:05,637
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just curious, like what research we did to decide that we weren't going to

297
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:09,525
[SPEAKER_09]: buy something and instead we were going to build this way.

298
00:29:11,226 --> 00:29:16,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would have to go back to kind of the discussion that we had with Kathy Madaglio.

299
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, Alex, looks like she wants to say something as well.

300
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:32,398
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that part of what we were concerned about with a quote unquote boxed curriculum is that then it's kind of one and done, as Alex said, that the kids have a specific unit.

301
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:48,437
[SPEAKER_06]: but that if the teachers aren't really learning the underpinnings of how to do this on their own, they're not able to just kind of incorporate it naturally and become kind of educated readers themselves as they're looking at a book and reading it to have those discussions.

302
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:55,120
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that the background knowledge and really understanding the history of disability, really understanding ableism,

303
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:06,325
[SPEAKER_06]: is something that is, it takes a little bit longer and it's not really something that you're going to just, you know, give one presentation, have people come in and do that and walk away with that underlying knowledge.

304
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:13,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this is building kind of teachers who are able to then incorporate it daily rather than just two weeks during the year.

305
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:14,249
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.

306
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:15,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, absolutely.

307
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:16,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

308
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:23,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, I think the professional development is critical because I, without it, you can't do that authentically, I guess.

309
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:32,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the professional development piece is sort of different, at least in my mind, than the curriculum piece.

310
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:51,288
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have 10 topics we wanna cover and we don't have a curriculum that sort of does scope and sequence to cover those 10 topics, how are we sure we didn't miss a topic somewhere that we should have covered?

311
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:53,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's, so I don't,

312
00:30:53,732 --> 00:31:15,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the professional development is important for all the reasons you just described, but to me, that's sort of a different discussion than choosing to incrementally build things voluntarily versus identifying what the need is and determining, and maybe there's nothing out there, I don't know.

313
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:17,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I just was curious if you guys had looked at all of that.

314
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:20,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I might, yeah.

315
00:31:21,282 --> 00:31:24,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Susan, do you want to answer and then go to Alex?

316
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:34,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that Alex probably wants to talk a little bit about understanding our differences, because that is somewhat of a boxed curriculum that focuses on those, but she has some experience with that.

317
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:35,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe she'd like to comment.

318
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:45,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so CPAC actually did a lot of research trying to look for a curriculum that would answer our needs, and there is nothing out there.

319
00:31:45,111 --> 00:32:03,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, through discussions with the special ed subcommittee and with Cathy Medavio, we kind of got the conclusion that what we want to do, we want to infuse the curriculum with disability awareness information and allow students to spend a little bit more time with each topic.

320
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,908
[SPEAKER_02]: What exists, the closest we could find was something that is called understanding our differences.

321
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:13,529
[SPEAKER_02]: which was created in Newton, they are selling that.

322
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:24,358
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way it is done, it is, for instance, for a unit on autism, the whole school gets together and they stay with that topic for two hours.

323
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:27,701
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do some activities and they have some guests, but that's it.

324
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:31,404
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a two hour event and then they go to the classroom and it's done.

325
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:36,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, like I said, we're hoping to be able to go more in depth.

326
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:40,986
[SPEAKER_02]: and let the students stay with the topic and really interact with the ideas more.

327
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:47,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are in a situation in which we do have to kind of invent this, invent the wheel.

328
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:48,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

329
00:32:49,072 --> 00:32:51,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, that's super helpful.

330
00:32:52,955 --> 00:32:55,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, so do we have a framework?

331
00:32:55,477 --> 00:33:02,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, are we working toward a framework of, like, here is what we want to be teaching at each grade level?

332
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:04,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, has that...

333
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:12,579
[SPEAKER_09]: been articulated and Susana, I think you sort of said you needed support from the school committee.

334
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:16,441
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm interested in what that is, what support it is that we could provide.

335
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:18,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just say something.

336
00:33:19,322 --> 00:33:31,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can learn from understanding our differences and the list of conditions and disabilities that I provided in my PowerPoint is what they are offering.

337
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:32,930
[SPEAKER_02]: And

338
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:38,548
[SPEAKER_02]: they actually have some guidelines of what they present at each grade.

339
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:39,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can look at that.

340
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:47,299
[SPEAKER_02]: They are covering just elementary school, so maybe we want to do elementary and middle school, or we want to play with that.

341
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:52,004
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is some information out there that we can use.

342
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:53,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Melanie?

343
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:56,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

344
00:33:56,322 --> 00:34:08,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to speak from a parent perspective, but also as the former co-chair of the CPAC, we had actually, Kathy Medaglio and I, and the CPAC had been working on this idea for some time.

345
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, we did purchase Understanding Our Differences.

346
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:18,588
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Brooks School for fifth grade as part of the inclusion committee for the Brooks.

347
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:23,289
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the autism unit, but it never was actually implemented.

348
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:33,211
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up having a transition between a former principal and a newer principal, and it sort of just fell through the gap, and it just was never picked up again.

349
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:40,613
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the other part of the problem with a one-time event, you know, that if it doesn't happen, if something gets rescheduled, obviously it's not going to happen.

350
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:42,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kathy and I talked much more

351
00:34:42,662 --> 00:34:47,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was expensive by the way, it was like $1,500 for the one unit for fifth grade.

352
00:34:48,168 --> 00:35:04,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was some, we were looking at whether we wanted to expand that, but Kathy and I had talked more and that was when Kathy was really talking about infusing the curriculum and not having a one and done for all of the reasons that folks mentioned and actually starting with a pilot

353
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:16,724
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to the understanding our differences, right, Alex, where it started with a grade for the curriculum so that there was a curriculum map, if you will, for one grade as you're talking about, like, what is the framework?

354
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:22,090
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you start small with a pilot with one curriculum map for that grade, if you will.

355
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:25,946
[SPEAKER_01]: and then looking beyond expanding after potentially that year.

356
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:30,868
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to add to the point of Susanna's disability awareness curriculum.

357
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:39,952
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so well-received last time, and you've done such an amazing job on the syllabus and working with all that, that we're really glad to see all of that, Susanna.

358
00:35:39,992 --> 00:35:46,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has been an evolution of the past, I would say, five years of discussion and work, the combination of that.

359
00:35:47,036 --> 00:35:49,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks, I just wanted to add that.

360
00:35:51,015 --> 00:36:03,923
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had a question, um, the book that you cited, uh, from the teacher's lesson plan, out of my mind, is that a book that fifth graders, um, in most classes are reading?

361
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:05,784
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

362
00:36:05,884 --> 00:36:11,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So the teachers have opportunities to be able to select different books that address the curriculum frameworks.

363
00:36:11,848 --> 00:36:17,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was not, um, one that would be aligned with journeys was an extra novel that she was reading.

364
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:36,946
[SPEAKER_06]: with her class and one part of the course was that we took different books and we presented them and talked about them and then teachers kind of selected something that really spoke to them or went out on their own and created a lesson around these books that have positive representations of people with disabilities.

365
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:42,368
[SPEAKER_06]: And then those books were all put into the school library.

366
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:54,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So that they were available and I know that the school librarian also at the Andrews and McGlynn happened to be there during the presentation because it was in the library and she started purchasing a bunch of books that kind of run that list as well so.

367
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:57,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that I think is a little bit of a grassroots effort.

368
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:02,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that if we want to select specific books, that's something that we need to talk about.

369
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:09,296
[SPEAKER_06]: If we decide that we want to have very specific goals for each grade level, that's something that needs to be laid out.

370
00:37:09,356 --> 00:37:10,857
[SPEAKER_06]: That work has not been done yet.

371
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:13,979
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not to say that it's not important.

372
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:15,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's very important.

373
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think that we have quite taken that step as of yet.

374
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:20,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So that to me would be a next step.

375
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:46,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, what I'm thinking is that, you know, again, it's wonderful the work you're doing today and the work you'll do in the next go round, but is there a way to, you know, suggest to other teachers who aren't participating at least to be looking at that lesson plan, which seems to be very comprehensive, so that maybe they'll be choosing that book too.

376
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:49,184
[SPEAKER_08]: to read in their classrooms.

377
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:54,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, my concern is what you're doing is fantastic.

378
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:57,970
[SPEAKER_08]: It just is for those who either aren't participating.

379
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:04,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And I totally understand that this year is so, again, how do we get all the curriculum pieces in?

380
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:07,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why it's so fantastic to be able to infuse it into the curriculum.

381
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:13,421
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm wondering how we can encourage all teachers

382
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,427
[SPEAKER_08]: to be looking at those.

383
00:38:16,787 --> 00:38:27,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering if we can identify a couple of lesson plans for each grade and send them out and just say, hey, FYI, this is one of the things that the district is really looking at.

384
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:29,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's some great lesson plans.

385
00:38:30,195 --> 00:38:36,439
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think that for some of our teachers, they might be vastly relieved to have it laid out so clearly.

386
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess I'm trying to say, how do we ramp it up a little bit more?

387
00:38:45,136 --> 00:39:00,369
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and I'm looking into next year too, how are we making sure that we are hitting, that there's, I mean, there's multiple topics, not just one topic, but so many different topics effectively for our students.

388
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:09,477
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I bet there will be some teachers who would just absolutely shine at doing this, but if your kid is not in that class, that's what the problem is.

389
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:10,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

390
00:39:10,738 --> 00:39:16,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that having it aligned with some different curriculum that we already have in place.

391
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:24,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for example, I know in the second grade journeys curriculum, they have some stories that are all around blindness and Braille.

392
00:39:24,873 --> 00:39:31,299
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's a nice segue because that's something that all teachers that are using the journeys curriculum are going to be addressing with their students.

393
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:32,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of an easy way to go.

394
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:34,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we need to

395
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:45,404
[SPEAKER_06]: be talking with Dr. Chiesa and making sure that, you know, as we're making suggestions around literature, that we really have, you know, her input as well, because obviously that's her department.

396
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:47,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Jenny?

397
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:57,627
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I guess sort of one thing that I was thinking about as you were talking, Susanna, and to Paulette's point,

398
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:10,661
[SPEAKER_09]: are there contractual levers that would allow us to make a PD like this required over some stretch of time?

399
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:15,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think that's like one starting gate, right?

400
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:21,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this PD is really important and it was well-received, but it is fundamentally voluntary at the moment.

401
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,889
[SPEAKER_09]: So is there some lever

402
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:34,708
[SPEAKER_09]: in the contract that we would have to like kind of tug on to say, this is going from something that's voluntary to something that's required in some way.

403
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:54,674
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if anyone has the answer to that question, but that certainly is a question that I have about how to make sure that we do sort of expose everybody to this professional development, because it, like I said, it sounds like it was incredibly well done and informative.

404
00:40:57,492 --> 00:41:02,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really, it depends on kind of the priorities of the time in the year.

405
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:12,556
[SPEAKER_06]: We certainly do have some mandatory PDs that happen during the year, but it's always a matter of, you know, what is our top priority at that particular moment?

406
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:21,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are some things that we need to make mandatory and we need to do those within the contract, within the teacher's contract, so that we're offering them at times that they are obligated to be there.

407
00:41:22,558 --> 00:41:25,259
[SPEAKER_06]: The times that this course are being run are after school hours.

408
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:26,679
[SPEAKER_06]: They're outside of contract hours.

409
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:31,180
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wouldn't be able to mandate that teachers attend something after school hours.

410
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:42,402
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that I would kind of look to probably somebody, you know, either Joan or Suzanne to kind of speak more on that about, you know, what we would be able to do in terms of contract.

411
00:41:44,383 --> 00:41:50,664
[SPEAKER_05]: So I also think that it's for their licensure, their education licensure, that they do have to

412
00:41:52,681 --> 00:42:09,626
[SPEAKER_05]: work towards so many PDPs for say special education, and this could be something that we offer if it's, you know, so many PDPs, you can use it towards your relicensure and make sure that you meet the special education requirement and that would be for all teachers, not just special education teachers.

413
00:42:10,686 --> 00:42:14,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that we can look at at how is we, how do we present it to

414
00:42:15,627 --> 00:42:27,532
[SPEAKER_05]: staff that this is something that you want to use, you want to take advantage of, because we can meet this requirement throughout the school year within a two month period to get those PDPs, that sort of thing.

415
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,173
[SPEAKER_05]: But like Susanna said, it is outside of

416
00:42:31,073 --> 00:42:56,685
[SPEAKER_05]: their contractual hours, but I think this is where the pilot program is going to be important because the people that take the course are going to go back into their schools and sort of be the cheerleaders about this is the importance of what I learned in this professional development and sort of come up with maybe some professional learning communities, things like that, that they can share what they learned and then it can grow from there within the school

417
00:42:57,805 --> 00:43:01,128
[SPEAKER_05]: building itself so that's something that we're looking at as well.

418
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:03,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that's great.

419
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:16,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Joan just took the words right out of my mouth because I was just gonna say that we're starting with the pilot, and then growing it from there I think, ultimately right the goal is that every single educator

420
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:20,302
[SPEAKER_04]: is having the opportunity to be a part of this training.

421
00:43:20,502 --> 00:43:21,402
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the goal.

422
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:27,484
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have to start with the pilot so that we can have those pieces built in that Joan was talking about.

423
00:43:30,064 --> 00:43:44,028
[SPEAKER_04]: The professional learning communities, using common planning time, all of those building blocks so that we can have the correct process for what's going to be the most effective way to deliver this to everybody.

424
00:43:45,743 --> 00:44:09,927
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other thing I was thinking about, Susanna, as you were talking particularly about the ELA curricula, this committee has an agenda item to create sort of an audit or a catalog of all our curricula and whether they are meeting our needs or not, and whether we are gonna start seeking new curricula and various components

425
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:34,175
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sort of wondering, Paulette, if we prioritize the ELA and literacy block for lots of reasons, but I think one of them is this sort of natural tie to say, have we evaluated our current curriculum with a lens of how does it help advance our objectives about disability awareness?

426
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:35,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it doesn't,

427
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there others out there that do a better job of that?

428
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:44,914
[SPEAKER_09]: So that that becomes part of our criteria as we look at our ELA curriculum at various levels.

429
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:54,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So there might be a way to add some supports there that like you said, like there's like little nuggets of it in the journeys curriculum, but probably not nearly enough.

430
00:44:55,616 --> 00:45:01,637
[SPEAKER_09]: So how do we think about that when we think about whether the journeys curriculum is the right curriculum for us?

431
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:09,507
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember, we also just last month talked about the racial equity piece.

432
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,308
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not just this.

433
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:21,237
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's multiple things that we're trying to provide comprehensive education for our kids.

434
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:25,981
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to talk a little bit more.

435
00:45:26,301 --> 00:45:27,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Maurice, I see superintendent.

436
00:45:30,106 --> 00:45:33,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I could even I just wanted to weigh in on.

437
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:47,094
[SPEAKER_07]: The piece regarding, I'm kind of happy there isn't an official canned curriculum that exists, because sometimes people will just check the box.

438
00:45:48,094 --> 00:46:00,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think as we shift, and we want to have a true mindset shift, when you do think about curricula, and you are creative, and you are able to have teachers and

439
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:08,252
[SPEAKER_07]: curriculum directors involved in creating something from the grassroots.

440
00:46:08,924 --> 00:46:17,749
[SPEAKER_07]: and kind of looking at the existing curriculum that's in place and finding areas where you can really make intentional connections.

441
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:20,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it sticks better for the children.

442
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:32,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we think about having this mindset shift, you know, eventually to roll it in grade level by grade level or focus on specific areas,

443
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:40,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel that letting it happen organically is the best way for it to bring about authentic change.

444
00:46:42,715 --> 00:47:02,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am excited about the course being offered again because there was such positive feedback for all the people who were able to participate in the first go round that I feel there's a lot of people kind of waiting for this second session to start in January.

445
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,202
[SPEAKER_07]: And if anything, I mean, I know it's going to be by Zoom that, you know, Susanna may end up with like a waiting list and have to say, well,

446
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:20,128
[SPEAKER_07]: let's target maybe a specific grade level or look at what it is to see if we could, that would be a good problem.

447
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:38,000
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just saying, I feel when you bring about new curriculum and you introduce it, you have to provide the right training, the right backbone so that people can understand the rationale behind it and be able to have it connect to something that already exists.

448
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:40,041
[SPEAKER_07]: So it doesn't feel like it's,

449
00:47:41,122 --> 00:47:44,444
[SPEAKER_07]: one more thing being added on, but it's just part of the work.

450
00:47:45,364 --> 00:48:07,214
[SPEAKER_07]: And to the point of what was said last month with looking at our curriculum across the board and saying, where can we integrate or incorporate racial awareness and equity awareness, instead of having it be, we're adding this on because we have to check the box, if it is just

451
00:48:07,812 --> 00:48:15,298
[SPEAKER_07]: incorporated, it will not feel like an add on and the students will be the greatest beneficiaries of it all.

452
00:48:15,898 --> 00:48:21,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to bring up that point.

453
00:48:21,923 --> 00:48:27,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wondering whether any of the teachers who've participated before have been from the vocational school.

454
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:37,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that there were any vocational teachers who participated last time that I can remember.

455
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:39,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to go back and double check the list.

456
00:48:40,403 --> 00:48:52,834
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have a variety of staff who participated, including administrators, paraprofessionals, a couple of paraprofessionals, and pre-K through high school.

457
00:48:53,494 --> 00:48:55,976
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't remember there being a vocational teacher.

458
00:48:56,116 --> 00:48:58,158
[SPEAKER_06]: There were unified arts teachers, though, as I mentioned.

459
00:48:58,874 --> 00:49:14,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, where I'm what I'm thinking is that, you know, as teachers are attending this they're also learning more about the disabilities that they students might have, particularly say, you know, a student on the spectrum.

460
00:49:18,308 --> 00:49:20,089
[SPEAKER_08]: that that goes across the board.

461
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:40,802
[SPEAKER_08]: So it may not be that the carpentry teacher in essence is really teaching or developing a unit, but also I guess there's another piece of saying, how do we make sure that our staff is knowledgeable about different disabilities that their students have?

462
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,144
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know how we do that.

463
00:49:44,164 --> 00:49:45,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody wanna address that?

464
00:49:46,311 --> 00:50:03,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So the course is two, it's kind of two pronged that a part of it is about learning how to teach students about disabilities and how to be, you know, kind of a mindset that is inclusive.

465
00:50:04,018 --> 00:50:14,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other part of the course is about the teachers learning about disability so that they can learn how to use universal design so that they are giving access to

466
00:50:15,843 --> 00:50:18,484
[SPEAKER_06]: more students in a very natural way.

467
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:22,105
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that both of those kind of go hand in hand.

468
00:50:22,205 --> 00:50:40,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of the course is actually going through how are students found eligible for individualized educational plans, which I think general educators really benefit from that background because they're not always sure, you know, which kids qualify and why and why not and how can a student have a disability and not have an IEP in some cases.

469
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:45,252
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we talk about 504s and about the laws that apply to those.

470
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:48,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that there's a lot of education that goes into this.

471
00:50:48,494 --> 00:50:52,616
[SPEAKER_06]: That's way more than just, um, knowing how to teach kids about disability.

472
00:50:53,096 --> 00:50:57,358
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about giving the teachers the background knowledge so that they can help their own students access.

473
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:08,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and we all learn a little bit about ourselves too, because we realize that we're all using different strategies to help ourselves because we all have strengths and weaknesses and it's, you know, it's kind of an eyeopening experience.

474
00:51:09,064 --> 00:51:09,544
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

475
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:11,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

476
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else like to have a question?

477
00:51:15,483 --> 00:51:15,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Comment?

478
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:17,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Joan?

479
00:51:18,206 --> 00:51:18,346
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

480
00:51:19,147 --> 00:51:25,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Paula, when we do have a student with a disability and the vocational teachers or other teachers are

481
00:51:26,573 --> 00:51:30,914
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, want assistance with the IEP accommodations or modifications.

482
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:32,855
[SPEAKER_05]: We do do a lot of consultation.

483
00:51:32,915 --> 00:51:34,195
[SPEAKER_05]: We pull the team together.

484
00:51:34,215 --> 00:51:37,296
[SPEAKER_05]: We say, you know, what does this accommodation mean?

485
00:51:37,696 --> 00:51:41,237
[SPEAKER_05]: How does that, how can you implement that in your particular classroom?

486
00:51:41,277 --> 00:51:45,118
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what, so there's a lot of ongoing consultation throughout the school year.

487
00:51:45,658 --> 00:52:04,354
[SPEAKER_05]: So teachers get to know the students, what their IEPs mean, how to implement them, and any issues or concerns that come up, the team will meet to relook at things and revisit the IEP, and just to offer any sort of assistance that would need to occur within the school year.

488
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:06,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

489
00:52:07,737 --> 00:52:09,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody else have any questions?

490
00:52:10,439 --> 00:52:11,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Alex?

491
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:18,974
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a question about how I understand the process.

492
00:52:19,314 --> 00:52:30,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is going to be the training that Susanna is going to offer, and then we are going to open the pilot to a couple of teachers, and they are going to pick their own topics.

493
00:52:30,603 --> 00:52:36,548
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to pick disabilities that interest them, I'm assuming, and create lesson plans.

494
00:52:36,828 --> 00:52:40,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And then is there going to be a report by the end of the year?

495
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how are we going to find out how

496
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:47,601
[SPEAKER_02]: it worked and what the next plans are, next steps?

497
00:52:49,702 --> 00:53:07,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Alexia, that was exactly my question, is saying how will we follow up on this and then make sure that we're expanding on it in successive years and being able to also evaluate our success of

498
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:14,295
[SPEAKER_08]: implementing this curriculum or in our larger school.

499
00:53:16,216 --> 00:53:16,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Any thoughts on?

500
00:53:18,717 --> 00:53:23,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Next steps, I would say we need to identify the teachers who will be conducting the pilot.

501
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:36,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there needs to be work that's done with that professional learning group so that we will be talking with that committee to find out what is appropriate at that grade level.

502
00:53:37,428 --> 00:53:51,477
[SPEAKER_06]: to be targeting, what is already present in the curricula for that gray level that could be tied to this disability awareness course so that we will be kind of doing that work hand in hand with the teachers.

503
00:53:51,657 --> 00:53:55,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they are the experts in knowing what it is that they are already teaching.

504
00:53:56,821 --> 00:54:04,465
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, what books they use or what books they might want to substitute in or out and, you know, collaborating as well with the content teachers.

505
00:54:04,565 --> 00:54:12,029
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a teacher who feels like they really wanted to target this through some of the social studies curricula, then we could do that.

506
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:20,614
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's somebody who feels that they really want to target it through ELA, we could do that, but we need to pull in the appropriate directors to make sure that they're also on board.

507
00:54:20,714 --> 00:54:21,615
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that

508
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:33,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really lay out exactly the plan because I think that what we need to do is get the pilot going and have that be a professional learning community where we're really working on that work together with the educators.

509
00:54:34,788 --> 00:54:39,151
[SPEAKER_08]: How many teachers are you thinking in terms of the pilot?

510
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:44,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that we will see how many people volunteer.

511
00:54:44,773 --> 00:54:46,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm

512
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to aim big.

513
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:54,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if we end up with three different grade levels that we can try at once, I'm open to that.

514
00:54:54,755 --> 00:55:01,708
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as we have the staff who are willing and able to do that work, I'm there to support them.

515
00:55:02,937 --> 00:55:18,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I would think that it makes sense for this topic, again, that we touch back on it, either at the end of the year or definitely at the very beginning of next year, so we can see what happened and where we are.

516
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that seem, the pilot program was listed in the original presentation, was that from March to May?

517
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:30,982
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, so I feel like having a report for you in June makes sense.

518
00:55:31,506 --> 00:55:32,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that would be great.

519
00:55:33,126 --> 00:55:36,187
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can either add it on, perhaps, to our topics.

520
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:41,308
[SPEAKER_08]: We do know how crazy June gets, but I think that we need to circle back to it.

521
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:42,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Alex?

522
00:55:44,169 --> 00:55:46,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, another idea, I guess.

523
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:54,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that in the summer 2019, I think, Susana, you had a grant and you had the

524
00:55:55,570 --> 00:56:00,331
[SPEAKER_02]: adaptive books initiative, right, where teachers worked on that project.

525
00:56:00,371 --> 00:56:20,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if it's possible, maybe again over the summer, some teachers that are interested and are more natural, like attracted to this subject, to maybe work on something like this and use the summer to create more units and lesson plans, similar to the one that you share, and maybe the school committee can help with that.

526
00:56:23,158 --> 00:56:28,499
[SPEAKER_06]: The adapted book workshop that took place over that summer was a ton of fun.

527
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:34,161
[SPEAKER_06]: We created lots of different books at all different levels that were accessible to different students.

528
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:51,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And we still are using many of those books, but I think that that does overlap nicely, Alex, because you can look at what are the materials the teachers are using, and then what adaptations do we need to make to make those materials accessible?

529
00:56:53,207 --> 00:56:54,048
[SPEAKER_06]: for different students.

530
00:56:54,108 --> 00:56:56,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that that's a really good idea.

531
00:56:56,509 --> 00:57:03,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where we are in terms of, you know, grant funding for that, but it's certainly something that I can look into for you.

532
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:24,774
[SPEAKER_08]: As you say that, it also jogs me to be thinking that there are budget implications because we want to make sure that if there are particular books or units that people are excited about presenting, that they have the books or materials that they need.

533
00:57:25,395 --> 00:57:33,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So doing this prior to budget so that we were knowledgeable about what we would need would be particularly good.

534
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:35,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Paulette?

535
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Paul.

536
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:37,846
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.

537
00:57:38,526 --> 00:57:43,167
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure that we do pay special attention to funding.

538
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:48,388
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure we don't slide back into thinking PTOs are an actual way to fund anything.

539
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:50,369
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not.

540
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:54,750
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a source of dramatic inequality.

541
00:57:55,450 --> 00:58:00,831
[SPEAKER_00]: And any ideas of relying on the PTOs to fund anything should be rejected outright.

542
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:04,072
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not going to put it in the budget, then we are not supporting it.

543
00:58:06,305 --> 00:58:07,666
[SPEAKER_00]: period, end of sentence.

544
00:58:08,386 --> 00:58:21,811
[SPEAKER_00]: So I obviously very much wanna do all this, but I wanna make sure when we say we wanna do this, that we're not just relying on parents that can afford to make donations to their school's PTO, which is not all parents and not all schools.

545
00:58:24,052 --> 00:58:27,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

546
00:58:28,574 --> 00:58:29,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Melanie.

547
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:33,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, I appreciate that.

548
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:40,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say from a parent perspective as well from member Rousseau about not all schools have that benefit.

549
00:58:40,827 --> 00:58:55,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's true, which is why those funds particularly were used for from one PTO, one school PTO, the Brooks PTO, but they benefited the entire community because they were provided to all of the schools, the adaptive books.

550
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,982
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think to that point,

551
00:58:57,662 --> 00:58:58,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really important point.

552
00:58:58,483 --> 00:59:02,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Um some schools as we know, or have much more funding and much more access to funds than others.

553
00:59:02,745 --> 00:59:06,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we're thinking about how we're providing, um.

554
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:08,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything to our community.

555
00:59:08,829 --> 00:59:11,431
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be thinking about how we're providing it to all of our schools.

556
00:59:12,371 --> 00:59:15,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just had to add that as well, because I think that is a really important point.

557
00:59:16,394 --> 00:59:16,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can

558
00:59:23,532 --> 00:59:27,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree and understand that sharing has happened and that's wonderful.

559
00:59:28,675 --> 00:59:34,619
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that the school committee really can't pass a policy to do something that will depend on donations happening or not happening.

560
00:59:35,019 --> 00:59:40,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we really aren't supporting it if we aren't backing it up with a line item in the budget.

561
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:43,544
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say we're supporting it, we can campaign on supporting it.

562
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:49,127
[SPEAKER_00]: We are absolutely black and white not supporting it if it's not actually something we budget for.

563
00:59:51,777 --> 01:00:13,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so Jenny, would you like to make a motion that the school committee curriculum subcommittee receive a reconvene in June or prior to budget so that we can get an update and we can see what funding might be necessary to continue this work?

564
01:00:16,995 --> 01:00:17,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.

565
01:00:17,976 --> 01:00:18,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to make that motion.

566
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:20,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

567
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:26,847
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll second it.

568
01:00:26,987 --> 01:00:35,693
[SPEAKER_09]: But I particularly want to make sure that what those budgetary considerations are come to us long before June.

569
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:43,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So perhaps there's a way for us to have the motion say that as part of the budget request

570
01:00:44,638 --> 01:00:58,228
[SPEAKER_09]: that comes to us from, maybe it's the special education budget, that there will be a line item ask in your request to cover the work that we talked about.

571
01:00:59,929 --> 01:01:00,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do that.

572
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:01,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's great.

573
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Jenny, will you call the roll?

574
01:01:03,692 --> 01:01:03,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

575
01:01:04,993 --> 01:01:05,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Van der Kloot?

576
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:06,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

577
01:01:07,254 --> 01:01:07,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

578
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:08,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

579
01:01:08,595 --> 01:01:09,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mustone is absent.

580
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:10,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so

581
01:01:11,382 --> 01:01:14,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Two affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

582
01:01:14,626 --> 01:01:14,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

583
01:01:15,607 --> 01:01:18,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I think that we've really covered it.

584
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,273
[SPEAKER_08]: First, thank you, Alex and Tanya.

585
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:22,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything else that either of you would like to add?

586
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,483
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just to say thank you to everyone for

587
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:38,309
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, helping us make this come to fruition, hopefully, whether it be through a pilot and we grow it naturally that way.

588
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:44,113
[SPEAKER_03]: But we would just really appreciate the opportunity to present this to you today.

589
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

590
01:01:45,975 --> 01:01:46,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you.

591
01:01:46,515 --> 01:01:46,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

592
01:01:47,415 --> 01:01:52,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to both of you and to the work of the PAC over not just this year, but for many years.

593
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,121
[SPEAKER_08]: And that includes Melanie, too.

594
01:01:56,182 --> 01:01:56,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

595
01:01:57,972 --> 01:02:03,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just want to remind her we have a meeting in December off the top of my head.

596
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:09,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say it's December 11 December 10, I believe, 10, so it's a 10 so close.

597
01:02:09,568 --> 01:02:09,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

598
01:02:09,848 --> 01:02:12,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we were going to look at addicts.

599
01:02:13,978 --> 01:02:16,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

600
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:17,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

601
01:02:17,879 --> 01:02:19,900
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're looking at mathematics in December.

602
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,021
[SPEAKER_08]: We will again continue to let everybody here know.

603
01:02:23,201 --> 01:02:36,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So now this may be unprecedented, but, and Melanie, I know that you've had maybe a slightly shorter meeting, but I am going to ask whether we have a motion to adjourn.

604
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:38,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn.

605
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,784
[SPEAKER_08]: That means that we have actually accomplished something we have yet to accomplish.

606
01:02:46,146 --> 01:02:48,413
[SPEAKER_08]: We are having a shorter meeting than called for.

607
01:02:48,874 --> 01:02:51,763
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's because everybody was so well prepared.

608
01:02:52,104 --> 01:02:53,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so very much.

609
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:54,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

610
01:02:54,392 --> 01:02:55,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
