1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,581
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:03,121
My name is William Hewig.

3
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:05,443
I'm the Cable Counsel for the city of Medford.

4
00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:23,214
And I'm here to assist and conduct a cable television public hearing pursuant to the requirements of the Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 166A, which require a public hearing prior to granting cable television licenses or renewal licenses.

5
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:29,318
Accordingly, it's 6 PM now, and I call our public hearing to order.

6
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:41,263
I'm going to turn the meeting over at this time to Steve Smurty, who is the Communications Director for the City of Medford.

7
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:41,703
Thank you.

8
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:46,226
No problem.

9
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,009
As Bill said, I'm Steve Smurray, I'm the Communications Director for the City.

10
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:52,573
This is our Cable Licensing public hearing.

11
00:00:52,594 --> 00:01:01,665
You're going to hear today from Kevin Harrington, our Station Manager at MCM, as well as our Cable Counsel, Bill Huig.

12
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:08,932
We're going to have a brief presentation, a brief video, and a brief slide deck that Kevin's going to do.

13
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:13,616
And then we're going to have a brief Q&A if there are any questions.

14
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,380
Please use the React hand up emoji.

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,503
It's in the bottom of your screen on the toolbar with the little heart.

16
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:22,365
And then you can just click the hand up, and we'll call on you.

17
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:24,206
Or you can put your questions in the chat.

18
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:35,752
I also want to now read into the record of the Notice of Cable Television Public Hearing that was published in the Boston Globe on October 24th and October 31st.

19
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:38,914
Notice of Cable Television Public Hearing.

20
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:46,478
Please take notice that the City of Medford, Massachusetts, as issuing authority for a cable television license under MGL,

21
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:52,698
Section 166A will hold a public hearing on Wednesday, November 13th at 6 p.m.

22
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,741
The public hearing will be held virtually on Zoom.

23
00:01:56,221 --> 00:02:02,646
The purpose of the public hearing will be to determine whether to issue a cable television license to Verizon and Comcast.

24
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:17,119
All applications, reports, statements, and license drafts to be considered at the hearing that constitute public records under state law are available for public inspection during regular business hours and for reproduction at a reasonable fee.

25
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:30,911
Members of the public are invited to attend and be heard on the topic, A, whether the current cable operator is in full compliance with its currently existing cable license, and B, what are the Town's future community cable-related needs.

26
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:44,622
Okay, and I think I already introduced Bill and Kevin, so now I'm going to hand it back over to the chair, Council Bill Hewitt.

27
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:47,528
Thank you, Steve.

28
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,890
And good evening once again, everyone.

29
00:02:51,331 --> 00:03:03,521
I usually like to begin public hearings relating to cable renewal by giving you an overview of the process, a very brief overview of the process, beginning with good news and bad news.

30
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:06,564
I always start with the bad news first.

31
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:11,288
And the bad news is that a lot of the things that people come to a cable hearing for

32
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:16,332
are looking for in the renewal of a cable television license are not available to us.

33
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:28,703
Those specifically include reductions in cable rates, programming changes, or anything related to broadband, the provision of broadband or internet services by either the cable operators.

34
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:33,770
Unfortunately for us, those are not on the negotiating table.

35
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:43,345
This is by virtue of a number of regulations of the FCC and federal and state statutes that govern the procedure that we're undertaking at the moment.

36
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:59,738
So, although we welcome comments on any of those items, because they will be passed along to the cable operators, please understand that we cannot negotiate for any of those and we will not be able to produce any changes in any of those for you with the renewal license.

37
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,600
And now for the good news.

38
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,141
What can we get?

39
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:09,246
Well, the main thing we get from renewal cable licenses or initial cable licenses are funding support

40
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:14,389
for public access purposes and for the community or the city's cable-related needs.

41
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:19,051
And that funding support comes in two categories.

42
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:31,938
One, it's annual funding support for the annual operating budgets of the city's access provider, MCM, in the form usually of a percentage of gross annual revenues.

43
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:45,865
And the second form that these funding support comes in is something called a capital and equipment grant, which is sometimes on an annual basis or sometimes spread out or sometimes at the beginning of the license or at the middle of the end of the license.

44
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:58,655
But it's a large funding grant that allows the community and the access provider to acquire equipment and other capital needs that might arise over the course of the license term.

45
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:11,420
And the other thing that we can get and do get from cable television licenses, apart from funding support, is what I call side benefits, such as, for example, technology upgrades.

46
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:16,242
For example, the prior upgrade from 650 to 780 megahertz.

47
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:24,408
the installation of fiber optic lines, and now, most recently, the provision of HD channels for PEG surfaces.

48
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:31,173
All of those were provided by renewal of licenses, and some of them were provided in the middle of a renewal term.

49
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:42,062
But we can get and request those, and we will be requesting HD channels for PEG during the two license renewal negotiations we will be shortly undertaking.

50
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:48,568
The other thing that we can get is we can continue to get free public drops and free

51
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:59,642
basic service provided to public buildings and school buildings throughout the community.

52
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:04,666
And we have a long list of those public buildings that currently get that service, and they will continue to do so.

53
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:14,693
In addition to that, we get certain types of additional services, such as senior citizen discounts, which we'll get from one of the licensees, but not all of them.

54
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:20,614
So that's the idea of what we will be negotiating for, what we can get, what we can't get.

55
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:27,336
I will tell you we have two licenses that are coming up for renewal during the next year, 2025.

56
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:31,777
The first one will be Verizon, which is up on February 2nd, 2025.

57
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:37,459
And the second one is the Comcast license up for renewal on July 30th, 2025.

58
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:58,064
The other thing I'll let you know is, because we'll be dealing with this during our negotiations, the Comcast license can be renewed for up to 10 years, and I'm recommending that we renew it for the longest possible term, so that we have a continual income stream upon which we can depend for access and community cable-related purposes.

59
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,005
Verizon, however, will only renew for five years.

60
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:07,727
So we'll renew for five years, and then we'll renew for another five years, presumably in the middle of the Comcast term.

61
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:15,455
That said, as you earlier heard, the purpose of the hearing is to do two things.

62
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:23,899
To help your negotiators in the city in ascertaining the city's future community cable related needs.

63
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,381
And we seek your help and your assistance and your input for that.

64
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:34,345
And the second thing, the second purpose of the hearing is to provide a compliance audit for both Comcast and Verizon.

65
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:43,771
Our Comcast, or is Comcast, and is Verizon, are the two of them together in current compliance with their licenses.

66
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:52,458
We seek your assistance here to tell us if you have complaints about service, about customer service, about billing practices, or about signal quality.

67
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:58,664
for either one of those two operators, because those would constitute violations of the license.

68
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:02,387
And we would like to know that during the course of our negotiations.

69
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,630
That will assist us in two ways.

70
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,993
One, it'll perhaps give us a little bit of leverage in our negotiations.

71
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:09,735
But more importantly than that,

72
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:17,298
renewal time is the best possible time to get the cable operators to correct any issues or problems they have.

73
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,043
Because they are seeking a renewal themselves, they will respond quickly to any complaints we pass to them.

74
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,045
So keep that in mind, please.

75
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:33,612
And if you have any complaints or issues with either one, please let us know either tonight or by communication to email or letter.

76
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:43,240
to the City of Medford, and in particular to one of the two individuals who are with us tonight, Steve or to Kevin.

77
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:46,423
That concludes my presentation.

78
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:49,106
I'll now turn the floor

79
00:08:49,726 --> 00:09:05,746
over to Kevin Harrington, the station manager for MCM, who's going to give us some information in the form of a video and some slides about the benefits and the advantages and the services that MCM provides to the citizens and the subscribers of Medford.

80
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:06,387
Kevin.

81
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:08,913
Thank you, Bill.

82
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,354
Thank you, Steve.

83
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:12,054
Thank you, everyone, for tuning in.

84
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:16,376
As I've already previously mentioned, my name's Kevin Harrington.

85
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:19,497
I am the station manager for Medford Community Media.

86
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:27,801
I took over in October of 2021, and I've been having a pretty exciting adventure since then.

87
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:28,721
And one of the most

88
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:44,181
invigorating elements of working at this station, other than all the fantastic members and folks that I work with around the city, is seeing how much potential MCM has, seeing how much room for growth there is.

89
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:59,721
So for tonight's meeting, we put together a video that is meant to give you a sense of what this station, not only what it does, but what it can mean to the folks here in the community that participate in it.

90
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:01,181
We interviewed some of our members.

91
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:05,222
We produced this video all in-house at MCM.

92
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:08,583
So I wanted to first shout out my production coordinator, Sarah.

93
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:11,865
who's the other full-time employee here at the station.

94
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:19,592
I want to also shout out our co-op student from the Media Tech shop of Medford Vocational Technical High School, Jonathan Malerba.

95
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:30,841
I also want to shout out my previous production coordinator, Cat Darnell, who is now one of the two teachers at the Media Tech shop at the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

96
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:33,043
She helped us out with this shoot as well.

97
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,167
And so with all that set up out of the way,

98
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:45,760
I'm going to now share my screen so that you can see the video we've created, and I will mute my mic briefly.

99
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:53,047
And let me just confirm, Ken, you should be able to see a white screen.

100
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,671
Looks good, okay.

101
00:10:57,392 --> 00:11:00,395
And now I'm gonna mute my mic and I'll let this take it away.

102
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,726
Coming to Medford Community Media, I think one of the things that grabbed me right away were the people.

103
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:25,911
I'm Laura Duggan and I've been a member of Medford Community Media for about six years.

104
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:30,875
The show that I do here is called Looking Back at Medford History.

105
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:38,321
My name is Terry E. Cotter and I manage elder services and special programs at the West Medford Community Center.

106
00:11:38,969 --> 00:11:44,273
I'm Steve Bertorelli, and I'm the host and creator of the Stevie B Show here on Medford Community Media.

107
00:11:44,794 --> 00:12:04,711
I was drawn to Medford Community Media because we wanted to make sure that folks who couldn't attend our program physically would still have an opportunity to see it, because we thought it was not only a program for our immediate catchment, which is the West Medford community, but really for the city of Medford.

108
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:14,816
Well, back in the 90s, believe it or not, in 1995, I went into the studio, which was on Canal Street here in Medford, that we're looking for people to join.

109
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:27,323
And since I'm an actor, in my spare time, I always wanted to learn about production, television, and I always wanted help with, you know, behind the scenes, with camera work and directing.

110
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,925
And I also wanted to host my own show.

111
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,187
And I've enjoyed every minute of it.

112
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:41,402
And we have probably aired at least 60 interview shows for that program.

113
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:43,283
It's been a lot of fun doing it.

114
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:50,926
And in addition to the show I do here, I've done three movies based on my one-woman plays.

115
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:59,632
Well, my experience in working with Medford Community Media has been globally a really, really good thing.

116
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:05,897
We started out with Patrick Gordon back when he was the station manager.

117
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:17,406
And he was always available, always gave us access to the best equipment, and coming to do the shoots over at the community center.

118
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:19,147
And when we went through,

119
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:30,040
You know, the changes that we went through with COVID and coming into working with Kevin, that just continued.

120
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,100
It was almost seamless.

121
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:38,866
Staff here, from you to Kat to Sarah, have just been so helpful and so encouraging to me.

122
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,368
And it's very well run by their station manager.

123
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:46,691
I will give him an absolute 100% vote of praise because I like working with him.

124
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:47,492
He's a lot of fun.

125
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:57,182
You guys have been so helpful to me, and you've always been someone I can always talk to whenever I have anything personal to say, and you guys are top-notch.

126
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:58,464
I can't thank you guys enough.

127
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:00,825
How would it be great to grow?

128
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:06,747
Well, if they had more staff, they could do more outreach in the community, for sure, cover more city events.

129
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:14,169
And also, they might have enough staff to actually teach classes on how to edit, how to film.

130
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:24,492
More classes, I think, to learn more about the technology, from Photoshop to Adobe, and learning how to be a director behind the scenes.

131
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:39,602
I would want to see MCM continue to, you know, kind of build its portfolio of artistic programming, as well as to interact even probably more with the new Arts Center that we have here.

132
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:42,043
It can only grow if you get more staff.

133
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,465
I am amazed what they can do with just two.

134
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:56,098
As much as I love this studio, I think that the station, it should have a new location for it because it's right where its location is, possibly somewhere near Mefford Square.

135
00:14:56,118 --> 00:15:15,823
And always to have the facility to do more programming in the studio that maybe needs a little bit more room or that maybe is a little bit more challenging from a technical standpoint and would require some different equipment that perhaps the station doesn't now have.

136
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:31,692
Well, I think this station is very important because whereas Medford no longer has a local newspaper, it provides a lot of coverage on various programming that's going on around the city and meetings that happen.

137
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,273
Medford has a pretty significant elderly population.

138
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:51,623
So being at home and being able to click on to the two public access channels as well as the educational channels and government channels is really important to folks who can't get around the way that they used to.

139
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:52,804
public access.

140
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:58,827
If you want to make a show whether it be about politics or even gardening or any other thing you can come and do a show here.

141
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:07,393
Plus you have government where you see city council meetings, you get to see what's going on in the city of Medford, what's happening and that's another thing.

142
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:14,618
I also think it provides an opportunity for young people who are interested in the media to come and learn and

143
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:23,607
use the equipment and be trained in terms of editing and different aspects of television production.

144
00:16:24,128 --> 00:16:37,882
And really, beyond maybe the offerings that the school has, Medford High School has itself in media arts, it's really the only place where this can be done on a significant level.

145
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:49,508
I really love that this is a place where grown-ups or young folks alike can come here and make something they want.

146
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:50,628
They can be creative.

147
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:57,170
They can create something fictional, non-fictional, and just exercise that drive.

148
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:09,114
I think what Medford Community Media means to me on a personal level, it's the ability to extend relationships.

149
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:18,538
The relationship that we as a community-based organization have with our local constituency, with the greater city.

150
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:26,136
and with, you know, with individuals who are interested in the kinds of things we do with our programming.

151
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:32,261
So I think all of what we do at the community center is relationship driven.

152
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,944
I kind of came out of my shell.

153
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:38,306
I discovered acting and it was something that I

154
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:46,390
really love to do and it introduced me to so many friends that I have, friends for life pretty much.

155
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:56,860
This station has become very important to me because it's allowed me to express my creativity and use it to create projects.

156
00:17:57,341 --> 00:18:02,886
It's really added to the quality of my life and because the staff up here is very friendly and warm and welcoming.

157
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:08,808
I really get a lot of personal satisfaction and excitement about every show that I'm preparing.

158
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:13,690
And when I watch it on TV, you know, it gives me a real charge.

159
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,450
It really does.

160
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:22,032
One thing I will never forget was when I was doing my cable access show, and I was at a place in Medford called Amici's, which is a pizza place.

161
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:30,895
And I was eating my lunch, and these three kids came up from a local school and said that, you're the guy on the show, right?

162
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:31,875
Can we get your autograph?

163
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:36,157
And I'm like, no one has ever asked me for an autograph in my life.

164
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:45,343
And I really, I just, I signed some paper plates with a marker, you know, but it's, it feels good to know that people are watching you.

165
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:51,907
The, the, the feedback that I've gotten is so generous and so positive and, uh, I love doing it.

166
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:55,049
And thanks to the station in a way I've came out of my shell.

167
00:18:55,289 --> 00:19:09,562
Having this relationship with MCM is really, really important to me personally because I have a great personal relationship with Kevin Harrington and with the staff that he brings to do our shoots.

168
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:18,710
Kat Darnell, before she became a Medford teacher and instructor, she was instrumental in a number of the things that we did here at the station.

169
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,570
pull my husband in occasionally.

170
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:26,272
He and I have just found this to be such a positive thing in our life, an excitement.

171
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:35,074
And my friend Ruth, who's on a lot of projects, and Irene, who comes occasionally, adds a lot to the quality of our life, and it's exciting.

172
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:42,216
And I think because we're having such a good time, I'd like to think everybody out there is also having a good time.

173
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:53,325
Okay.

174
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,147
Thank you, everybody.

175
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:58,450
That was our little MCM video we put together.

176
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:05,939
And so now I would like to pivot to a slide presentation that we prepared.

177
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,160
So bear with us again.

178
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,583
We're just going to get the screen share going over here.

179
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:29,522
And how's that look for everybody, Steve and Bill?

180
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:30,444
You can see that okay?

181
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:32,929
Yeah, it's good.

182
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,271
Fantastic, so this is a pretty short presentation.

183
00:20:38,291 --> 00:21:04,837
I don't want to belabor it too much but this is basically just going to highlight the Estimates for what what we're going to need going forward what we're going to want going forward By kind of projecting what we what our budget is this year and then what it would look like next year and that we would hopefully replicate that for the Coming years after that for the for the length of licenses and then also some of the capital expenses that we're going to look at

184
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:13,624
So this table here is just to give you a glance at what fiscal year 25, which we're in right now.

185
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:15,906
This is what we're doing.

186
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:21,331
We have the two full-time roles for the MVTHS co-op.

187
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:25,574
That's technically one role, but it's two students who alternate.

188
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:29,237
Weeks because there's a shop week in an academic week.

189
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:42,666
We have stipends set aside so there's our personnel and then our expenses are 50k a year as of right now and so we're looking about two hundred and eight thousand four hundred twenty four and

190
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:52,133
And this fiscal year 26 that we're projecting here is if we kind of expanded the team to what I would hope to do.

191
00:21:52,233 --> 00:22:05,444
So I would love to have, because we are a PEG station, we have public access, educational access, and government access, I would like to have a production coordinator for each of the three letters in PEG we currently have.

192
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:13,348
Sarah Pendenza as our production coordinator, so she could be in the gov spot and then we would have two other production coordinators.

193
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:26,133
As of right now, we're estimating this role at the highest step for the CAF that it's in, so basically the highest possible in the salary grade, just to overestimate slightly, you know what I mean?

194
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:28,694
You don't want to, you'd rather overestimate than underestimate.

195
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:32,516
just to make sure that you kind of have the wiggle room, as it were.

196
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:37,459
But I want to remind everyone that the figures are all, these are preliminary estimates, right?

197
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,539
Nothing is set in stone.

198
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,260
This is just what we're kind of working on right now.

199
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,922
I would also want to add a role for a meeting coverage videographer.

200
00:22:45,576 --> 00:23:02,552
I have a few people that cover the booth, including Sarah a decent amount of the time and myself, and I would want to have a dedicated role where we could pay somebody to cover the booth and we could keep myself and Sarah here at the studio to help our members with those studio productions.

201
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:10,501
So then that total would come up, it would be an increase in our personnel totals, bring it up to $279,889.86, and bring our total, again, estimated fiscal year budget to $329,889.86.

202
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:23,389
Some capital projects.

203
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:27,591
I won't go too deep in the weeds on these unless people have follow-up questions.

204
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:30,733
I would love to answer and talk shop about any of these.

205
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:33,995
But I'll just hit a couple of the big ones.

206
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:41,699
And again, this is trying to estimate in the next 10 years what we would want to spend our capital on.

207
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,100
We have a second page of this, by the way.

208
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,963
So studio lighting upgrade would be the big one and will be the one that I would want to do the soonest.

209
00:23:49,823 --> 00:24:05,443
Lighting system in the studio is adequate for the moment, but it doesn't really allow for a lot of control of individual lights It's kind of they're all on or they're all off So we want to give people more creativity and freedom to use lighting and lighting cues And also just to make sure that we have up-to-date equipment

210
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:07,465
And then we have a couple of things.

211
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:16,357
The Alden Chambers, we've recently completed an audio upgrade, which was ARPA funds, so that was separate from what we're working with here.

212
00:24:16,777 --> 00:24:23,986
But the video camera system, the switching system, and how it integrates with the broadcast, we'd want to upgrade that.

213
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:50,838
uh... on the sooner side and then a couple of things including uh... an eighty upgrade for the rooms two oh one into a seven city hall and you can carry the rest of them are all pretty uh... self-explanatory studio camera just meeting cameras in the studio care of field camera media camera can bring out the field pretty pretty self-explanatory but i was like to make sure that that tv lingo is a kind of skin glossed over and then here we have a couple more items

214
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,965
including replacing the iMacs.

215
00:24:53,985 --> 00:25:02,711
We have some iMacs for our editing computers that have been workhorses for a long time, but they are from some from 2015, some from 2017.

216
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:04,593
They are showing their age.

217
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:10,778
So we're going to want to get those redone either with up-to-date iMacs or possibly replacing them with PCs.

218
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:16,142
We would also, the studio relocation I want to mention, this is a very, very

219
00:25:18,043 --> 00:25:32,348
Broad guesstimate because if the high school is replaced in the next 10 years, which I know a lot of folks are hoping to have that happen, I believe there's a whole committee trying to plan on a possible.

220
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:52,791
school renovation and what have you because we're on high school grounds that would affect us greatly so just want to have that project set aside so that if for some reason we can't access this current space for however many months or even a year we would have to budget in renting space somewhere

221
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:57,114
lugging all the gear out and then, you know, eventually coming back into our new spot.

222
00:25:57,634 --> 00:26:01,856
And then a production truck van is a wish list blue sky item.

223
00:26:02,276 --> 00:26:09,560
I would love to have a van, even if it's not kitted out as a production van with a built in switching system and the ability to live stream.

224
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,023
Just even having a branded van that we could, you know, not put so much wear and tear on our personal vehicles.

225
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:17,664
And also it would be branded.

226
00:26:17,724 --> 00:26:19,184
We would have a little bit more.

227
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:25,026
You know, name recognition, driving around town, that kind of thing would be nice.

228
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:29,287
So that about completes the slides.

229
00:26:29,307 --> 00:26:31,827
So I'll stop the screen share there.

230
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:36,268
And I will hand it back over to Bill, I believe.

231
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:46,270
And I believe you're muted at the moment, Bill, if you don't mind just unmuting your microphone.

232
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,352
Yeah, still muted.

233
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:57,434
All right.

234
00:26:57,855 --> 00:26:58,276
How's that?

235
00:26:58,677 --> 00:26:59,198
There you are.

236
00:26:59,398 --> 00:26:59,759
Perfect.

237
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,100
All right.

238
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:02,425
Um, let me get that little,

239
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,188
OK, I'm back.

240
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:06,970
Thank you for that presentation, Kevin.

241
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,491
That was extremely helpful.

242
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:21,702
And it was a great video showing a lot about your program with MCM and the benefits that are so apparent to not only the members of the community, but also to your staff and the folks who work for you.

243
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:28,308
And the numbers that you gave us, of course, are preliminary in nature.

244
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:32,970
This is the product of the ascertainment process we're involved in.

245
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:38,952
So our task is to determine our future needs, both on an annual operating basis and also in future capital.

246
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:40,733
And we're putting that together now.

247
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:44,574
And that will serve as the basis of our negotiations with the two cable operators.

248
00:27:45,815 --> 00:27:51,557
The next thing on the agenda is to read into the record any letters or emails we have from any members of the public.

249
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:53,638
At present, we don't have any.

250
00:27:54,178 --> 00:28:03,764
But I'm inviting any of you who are out there watching to do so, to send us letters or email messages and tell us two things.

251
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:12,589
One, what would you like to see in the cable television licenses for Comcast and for Verizon as they get renewed in the year 2025?

252
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:17,952
And two, do you have any complaints about the compliance with their licenses of either

253
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:20,894
on the part of either Comcast or Verizon.

254
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:32,033
And again, the types of compliance complaints that are helpful for us to know are if you've had problems with customer service, for example, being put on hold for a long time.

255
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:40,271
if you've had problems with signal quality, and if you've had problems with billing or any financial issues.

256
00:28:41,112 --> 00:28:53,819
If you have, let us know, because that's an important part of our negotiations with each one of the cable operators, and it will assist us greatly if you let us know any difficulties, problems, or complaints you may have.

257
00:28:56,361 --> 00:29:07,748
And now we're going to turn the public hearing over to members of the public who may be in attendance, may be watching, and may wish to have questions or comments for us.

258
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:15,753
And for that, I'm going to turn the meeting back over to Steve, who's going to call on any members of the public who wish to speak.

259
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:16,474
Thank you, Steve.

260
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:17,735
Thanks, Bill.

261
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:29,048
I just also want to reiterate if you do have any letters or emails or you want to get in touch with us in any way regarding our cable licensing, you can either email me, which would be the easiest way.

262
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:35,435
My email, I will also put in the chat, but it is ssmirti, S-M-I-R-T-I, so two S's.

263
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:38,697
at medford-ma.gov.

264
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:51,759
You could also send us actual letters in the mail and address them, attention to myself at Medford City Hall, room 202, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA 02155.

265
00:29:53,340 --> 00:30:02,702
As I said at the start of the meeting, if you have a question, you can either put it in the chat or you can use the hand up emoji and I will ask you to unmute and you can ask a question.

266
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,180
So are there any questions out there?

267
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:20,843
Okay, I don't see any, so I think I will send it back up to you, Bill.

268
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:29,705
And I would just reiterate again, if you're watching this later and you have a question, please feel free to email myself or Kevin, and we'll get the answer for you.

269
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:31,033
Bill.

270
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:32,253
Thank you, Steve.

271
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:39,935
Members of the public, those of you who are watching or who will watch, there is still an opportunity for you to participate.

272
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:44,236
You don't have to just watch tonight and you don't have to just listen tonight.

273
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:46,416
You can watch this video.

274
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:50,217
It'll be posted on the town's website and it'll be available for review by you.

275
00:30:50,877 --> 00:30:55,158
And if those of you who do so in any future point of time,

276
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:10,324
do that, please do communicate to us with any issues you would like to see addressed by cable operators and or what you would like to see in the future community cable related needs for the City of Medford.

277
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:11,765
This is your license.

278
00:31:12,545 --> 00:31:14,686
The folks you have before you are your servants.

279
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:21,948
They are here to enhance your life in the City of Medford by providing with public cable access and

280
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:34,220
and interfacing, allowing citizens in the city to interface with their government, with their fellow citizens, with the town's history, and with the programming that MCM has and will offer to you.

281
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:37,623
So please do participate.

282
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:40,727
Please let us know if you have anything you would like us to know.

283
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:46,071
We will be beginning our negotiations with Comcast and with Verizon later on in the fall.

284
00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:49,594
As I mentioned earlier, the Verizon license is up first.

285
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,414
It's January.

286
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:52,816
The Comcast license is up in July.

287
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:56,719
So that's the time frame in which we will be operating.

288
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,722
And what I'd like to say now is thank you.

289
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:05,366
Those of you who watch, those of you who will participate in the future, please continue

290
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:16,249
to participate and to keep us within the loop because we depend on you for assistance as we begin to prepare for negotiating the renewal licenses.

291
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,113
Thank you all, everyone.

292
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:19,015
Good evening.

293
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,360
And the public hearing is now closed.

294
00:32:23,284 --> 00:32:23,945
Thank you, everyone.

295
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:26,250
Thanks, everybody.
