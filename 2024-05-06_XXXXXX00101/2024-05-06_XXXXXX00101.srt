7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

[SPEAKER_03]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:44,098
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thanks so much for joining me today.

10
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:49,462
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't mind just starting by introducing yourself, so saying your name and pronouns and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:56,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I am Emily Lazzaro, she, her, and I am a Medford City Councilor.

12
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:58,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Emily.

13
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:06,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to start out just with our same question that we ask everybody at the beginning of the show, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

14
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,803
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite place to eat in Medford has not changed since the last time we talked.

15
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:11,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still Goldilocks.

16
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:15,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I like a lot of places, but I think Goldilocks is still my go-to.

17
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:22,556
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just on, I think they were on, uh, Jim and Marjorie on GBH maybe yesterday.

18
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:25,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were talking about bagels and flour and everything.

19
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:25,699
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very fun.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but my favorite thing is the rosemary salt bagel.

21
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:29,523
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing.

22
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:33,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was, uh, really fun to listen to them on the radio.

23
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's definitely a favorite of a lot of people.

24
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:37,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

25
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:37,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, great.

26
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:45,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So the last time you were here, or the last time we talked to you, you were running for city council and now you have been elected to the city council.

27
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:46,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So congratulations.

28
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:51,990
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering if you want to give us any updates or like reflections on how the first couple of months have been.

29
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:56,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, yeah, it's been a real whirlwind.

30
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:59,781
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been largely awesome.

31
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a lot of good experiences.

32
00:02:02,443 --> 00:02:06,727
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also been really challenging in some ways I didn't expect.

33
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:21,037
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a lot of really long meetings with a lot of public participation that's gotten pretty contentious because there have been a lot of changes proposed in the city that are, I think, reflecting some growing pains that are happening.

34
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:36,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, it's been really reflective of the challenges that we're facing but also really reflective of people's willingness and interest and engaging in the democratic process and.

35
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:42,209
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a really interesting working experience.

36
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:53,056
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been working through a lot of new proposals and a lot of changes to the way that we are doing business in city council.

37
00:02:55,477 --> 00:03:07,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Our city council president, Zach Baer, has changed the way that we are presenting our agendas, changed the way that we released a governing agenda in the beginning of our term.

38
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:16,388
[SPEAKER_01]: with a plan for what we're gonna present over the course of the whole two years, like everything that we're intending to do, and a rough timeline.

39
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:20,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's subject to change, but everything that we're hoping to accomplish.

40
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:31,779
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of it seemed a little bit maybe scary to some people, so they kind of like came out and said, hey, we're concerned about a lot of this, and we got a lot of pushback.

41
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily think it's reflective of everybody in town, but a lot of people were

42
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:43,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Worried about it so came out and spoke against it, but it also resulted in us having a lot of meetings that lasted past one in the morning.

43
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:50,767
[SPEAKER_01]: like personal kind of pushback.

44
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:57,731
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just our last meeting made a change to the rules about public participation.

45
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:09,537
[SPEAKER_01]: We cut down from five minutes per participant to three minutes and 90 minutes as a general limit on each section of public participation.

46
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:19,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Like per agenda item, but we actually amended that to be 90 minutes and then one minute per person after the 90 minutes if there's a large group of people.

47
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:26,190
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just for the regular meetings, not for committee meetings, those being the things where we take one item and sort of delve into it more deeply.

48
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:35,538
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all been a lot of changes really quickly, which I think is sort of reflecting in the community that people are kind of trying to adjust.

49
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:41,443
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all going through a period of adjustment, and we're figuring it out together.

50
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:48,609
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping to have a lot more opportunities to engage with the community through listening sessions, through meetings with

51
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,034
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Councilors and community members at the senior center, at the library.

52
00:04:54,054 --> 00:05:09,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm also on the committee for resident services and, um, community engagement, which, uh, we're hoping to put out monthly newsletters and, uh, updating people on what we're doing and how we're hoping to engage people.

53
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:10,629
[SPEAKER_01]: And engagement is always good.

54
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:13,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's something we hope continues.

55
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:14,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, yeah.

56
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:16,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And you mentioned this two-year plan.

57
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can people find that?

58
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:19,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a PDF.

59
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:21,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I have to look.

60
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:22,794
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be on our website.

61
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:24,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can link to it in the show notes.

62
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.

63
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:26,175
[SPEAKER_03]: We can definitely link to it in the show notes.

64
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

65
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:34,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I know it seems like a lot of excitement in the first couple months.

66
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:36,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Some meetings that maybe

67
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:45,023
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't go as, or maybe it's as expected, but, you know, sort of seeing kind of the shift, you know, I think we saw a shift in sort of the composition of city council.

68
00:05:45,063 --> 00:06:01,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And so maybe the pushback is kind of anticipated, but, um, seems like it could be difficult at times to manage, but, um, so I'm wondering with all that kind of, you know, you'd shared your priorities before being elected.

69
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if you could share kind of some of your current priorities.

70
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:05,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

71
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:08,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, affordable housing is always a priority of mine.

72
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:17,102
[SPEAKER_01]: I especially am interested in making sure housing is available for people who are kind of at the bottom of the economic ladder.

73
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:32,668
[SPEAKER_01]: People who have fallen through the cracks or or faced a couple of economic challenges that have made it impossible for them to secure housing because of various situations.

74
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes

75
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:43,876
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very easy to miss a payment of rent or a mortgage for some reason and face eviction very quickly sometimes.

76
00:06:44,496 --> 00:07:04,185
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're like a gig worker or maybe a service sector worker, I have a friend who's a nanny and has like a legal issue and as a result has a pending legal thing come up on a background check which means she cannot get a nanny job

77
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:20,060
[SPEAKER_01]: which means she can't pay her rent, which means she's facing an eviction and she has an elementary school aged child and is now suddenly, you know, like talking to people at like, she lives in a town with an office of housing stability.

78
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:25,383
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, she has like services for that sort of thing, but we don't have that kind of thing in Medford.

79
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:30,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So these sorts of things are very pertinent to like my concerns, my priorities.

80
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:30,706
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

81
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:55,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Affordable housing making sure that we're we're trying to take care of people that are just on the cusp of that sort of issue and Homeless services that kind of thing we have a very small Very effective and powerful group of people that works on that in City Hall, but we could always use more and a lot of our a lot of the things that we've been working on are to bolster our

82
00:07:57,522 --> 00:08:01,925
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable housing trust that we established, but hasn't had a lot of funding put into it yet.

83
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:19,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can use that once we fund it, we can use it to pay for things like complexes, to fund complexes like Wapling Court, which is something that's being, going through the approval process now.

84
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:22,820
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a rebuilding of a,

85
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:27,971
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, housing project that's in behind the Whole Foods in Medford.

86
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:38,899
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, uh, we could like partially fund something like that as a city, uh, instead of, uh, using, you know, grant, grant funding and other funding resources.

87
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if we had an affordable housing trust that we had been paying into for longer.

88
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:46,885
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that kind of thing.

89
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:50,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also really interested in looking into our city's infrastructure.

90
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:51,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

91
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:55,369
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically water and sewer is something that we're going to be talking about soon.

92
00:08:55,429 --> 00:09:01,230
[SPEAKER_01]: We have something on the agenda this week to discuss it that was brought forward by Councilor Scarpelli.

93
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really interested in talking about that.

94
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,831
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of deferred maintenance in the city that's really coming to a head soon.

95
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:19,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very eager to look into ways that we can update our city's infrastructure in the most effective and efficient way possible.

96
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:25,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Without, you know, you can't, there's so much to do and you can't do everything all at once.

97
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:32,780
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as you can figure out a way to balance everyone's priorities and do things in the best way possible.

98
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:37,866
[SPEAKER_01]: now that we're ready to actually take action, I think it's gonna be really good for the city.

99
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:48,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that those are two things that I hear people talk about a lot is like affordable housing, the cost to live in Medford, and then also the state of our kind of like streets.

100
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:54,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hear like, there's a lot going on all at once.

101
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:57,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder kind of what is supporting that?

102
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:01,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what is what are what you see as sort of like barriers to accomplishing those things?

103
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:07,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason that it's all, it feels like it's happening all at once is because it wasn't happening for so long.

104
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:18,156
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, we had one mayor for 28 years and it was during that time, it was easy for us to say everything was fine and kind of chug along.

105
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:24,761
[SPEAKER_01]: And also during that time and maybe after that time, a lot of

106
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,912
[SPEAKER_01]: the demographics of the city shifted.

107
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:35,198
[SPEAKER_01]: As people got priced out of different parts of this region, more younger families moved in.

108
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,962
[SPEAKER_01]: People from different backgrounds moved in.

109
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:44,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the makeup of Medford is different than it used to be.

110
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:50,831
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that live here want Medford to grow and to change with the people who live here.

111
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:54,517
[SPEAKER_01]: we're hoping to catch up now.

112
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:56,298
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing a lot of catching up all at once.

113
00:10:57,018 --> 00:11:00,239
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of catching up to do.

114
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we try to do that, we have to do it piece by piece.

115
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:19,566
[SPEAKER_01]: But trying to balance everybody's priorities is going to be the challenge, like making sure that we're paying attention to updating the schools, updating the roads, updating the water and sewer infrastructure, paying attention to climate mitigation, paying attention to

116
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:25,778
[SPEAKER_01]: other things that are falling into disrepair at the same time.

117
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:30,903
[SPEAKER_01]: As you do one project, it takes a long time, and then you're deferring the next project.

118
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:34,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And then before you know it, you do three projects, and the first one needs to be redone again.

119
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:39,310
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything kind of falls into place on a timeline like that.

120
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:46,017
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think as long as we're not approaching all of this from a place of,

121
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:52,712
[SPEAKER_01]: fear and resistance and thinking that when things change, it means that somebody's being left behind.

122
00:11:52,733 --> 00:12:05,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we can avoid that way of thinking, then everybody is coming along and everybody's being, everybody gets to be part of it and everybody gets to benefit from it.

123
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:09,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're all in it together.

124
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:13,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I think that we can all see it as a net positive.

125
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:19,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think and I watched the meeting where you all talked about the real estate transfer fee.

126
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:22,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked to Kit and Matt a couple of weeks ago.

127
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:39,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there was this there was, you know, a large crowd there that and they all seem to be in agreement with each other about, you know, the what they were sort of interpreting as like an unfair burden on people who own homes.

128
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:42,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's like a

129
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:53,333
[SPEAKER_03]: trend that I seen sometimes is like it's not like sometimes it's like this change means you're taking something away from me, or like I'm going to lose something or.

130
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:58,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, which like, and, and I also talked to like a lot of people in the city who really do want.

131
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:03,030
[SPEAKER_03]: a place that's nice to live and to take care of their neighbors.

132
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wonder how you make sense of that or how that comes up for you.

133
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:17,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest problem with that meeting, the real estate transfer fee meeting, was the intentional misinformation that was swirling around about that.

134
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:26,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Because by the end of the meeting, we had some people that came up a couple times and had genuine questions that we answered for them.

135
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:51,705
[SPEAKER_01]: about the real estate transfer fee and how, frankly, for developers who would be the target of that fee, that it would be borderline insignificant to their bottom line, and that that is what we needed people to grasp, that it's not about punishing people

136
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:54,999
[SPEAKER_01]: who are struggling.

137
00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:20,507
[SPEAKER_01]: It is about utilizing the people who are making a significant profit from the real estate market in Medford and suggesting that they have the opportunity to give back to Medford, the city that made it possible for them to make a large profit.

138
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:24,837
[SPEAKER_01]: and have the rest of the city benefit from it.

139
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:33,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this city is what gave them the opportunity to make that profit.

140
00:14:34,724 --> 00:14:49,736
[SPEAKER_01]: The services in the city, the things that are happening in the city, the schools and the parks and everything about the city that exists here, even the proximity to Boston, whatever, the jobs that are here, that's what made that property value increase to that degree.

141
00:14:50,898 --> 00:15:01,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's logical that there would then be a small percentage of it that goes back to the city that allows the city to continue to prosper.

142
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:04,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the way you have to think about it.

143
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:12,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it's not, it doesn't take away from the profits that are made by developers because their profits are so much.

144
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:13,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And that,

145
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:21,151
[SPEAKER_01]: We would be thinking of it strategically with carve outs so that we're protecting people who need protection.

146
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:23,734
[SPEAKER_01]: People on fixed incomes.

147
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:28,639
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing is, real estate transfer fee was not my proposal.

148
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not even on the committee that's going to be hashing out the details of this.

149
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:42,535
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do plan, once they do discuss it in committee, I plan to attend it and pay attention to what they're talking about.

150
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:44,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Though that committee is focused a lot on zoning reform right now.

151
00:15:47,158 --> 00:15:50,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may not be, it may be a while before they discuss it.

152
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,983
[SPEAKER_01]: But once they do, I'll be in attendance.

153
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:55,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't, I'm not a voting member.

154
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:59,327
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't vote until it's back in regular committee or committee of the whole.

155
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:05,083
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it is, I mean, I haven't made up my mind because it hasn't been hammered out yet.

156
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:09,886
[SPEAKER_01]: But another thing I would want to say is that committee meetings are open to the public.

157
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:11,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Committee meetings are open meetings.

158
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:13,988
[SPEAKER_01]: They're advertised the same way as regular meetings.

159
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:18,570
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people are interested in learning more about these things, they should definitely plan to attend committee meetings.

160
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,211
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to be shorter.

161
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:22,071
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have public comment.

162
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:25,313
[SPEAKER_01]: You can talk for longer because there's usually less people.

163
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:26,534
[SPEAKER_01]: You can engage.

164
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:28,234
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go back and forth if you need to.

165
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:41,779
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great opportunity to see Councilors talking to each other for longer periods of time because you're really talking about the details of a proposal and discussing things at length.

166
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular meetings, we don't have time to do that because we're talking about a lot of things.

167
00:16:46,062 --> 00:16:49,185
[SPEAKER_01]: But the committee meetings, we're talking about one thing for like an hour.

168
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:53,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's real nitty gritty stuff.

169
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,421
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, real estate transfer fee, the only reason we were talking about it is because the governor wants it.

170
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:00,242
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more likely to happen.

171
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:06,204
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exciting because it could help us fund our affordable trust fund.

172
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:08,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

173
00:17:08,465 --> 00:17:11,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that actually clarifies a lot of the questions that I had.

174
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:12,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

175
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:18,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I know you just, I know before we started recording, you were chatting, we were chatting a little bit about your work at the Malden Warming Center.

176
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:23,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to see like, you know, if you had, if that's kind of brought up any connections to Medford.

177
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:25,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, for sure.

178
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:32,685
[SPEAKER_01]: So people who are dealing with homelessness aren't tied down to a municipality.

179
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:42,529
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have at the Malden Warming Center, we have people that come from other cities, of course, so you just go if you're unhoused, you go wherever you can access services.

180
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:46,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So we frequently would have guests that are from Medford.

181
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:49,872
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're

182
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:56,102
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't seasonal overnight shelters in Medford.

183
00:17:56,682 --> 00:18:00,766
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any shelters in Medford for men.

184
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:01,947
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a family shelter.

185
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:05,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it only has seven beds, seven rooms.

186
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:11,456
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to refer people to other towns.

187
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:27,965
[SPEAKER_01]: so my I have a goal to establish a warming center in Medford, but the There are a lot of models There's a model in particular that we could follow that Somerville and Revere have been doing the past couple of years Somerville.

188
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:37,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just started it this year these there the armory space on Highland Ave and Revere used their

189
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:38,743
[SPEAKER_01]: City Hall.

190
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:43,204
[SPEAKER_01]: But they contract housing families, which is a non-profit.

191
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:50,426
[SPEAKER_01]: But both of them followed kind of the playbook of the Malden Warming Center, which has been operational for six years now.

192
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:53,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the same basic rules.

193
00:18:54,407 --> 00:19:00,869
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been having conversations with a few parties about opening a center in Medford.

194
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:02,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to figure out a space.

195
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:07,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that we can make that happen for this coming winter.

196
00:19:07,454 --> 00:19:12,118
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on our governing agenda for me to try to move that forward.

197
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:30,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because as a region, I think it's really important that we all kind of work with other municipalities and make sure that we're trying to close all the gaps and do our part as a community as well to bolster the services that are being offered so that we can

198
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:39,015
[SPEAKER_01]: assist other cities that are, some are taking on more responsibility than others.

199
00:19:39,535 --> 00:19:43,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't, I don't think it means that those cities have more homeless people.

200
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,538
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it means that those cities offer more services.

201
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where people will go to access the services.

202
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:48,979
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not being turned away.

203
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:54,221
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and we don't, you know, at the Malden Warming Center, that's a nonprofit, but it does have a lot of city support.

204
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,682
[SPEAKER_01]: So the,

205
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:03,418
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't check papers at the Malden Warming Center.

206
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,858
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have ID checks.

207
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:09,400
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't ask for verification that you have some kind of Malden connection there.

208
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be the same in Medford.

209
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:19,963
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be like, as a community, we're trying to offer services to help people when they need help.

210
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:24,564
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the way of thinking about it.

211
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:28,295
[SPEAKER_01]: people who need help can come here.

212
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:35,319
[SPEAKER_01]: We will try to catch you before you fall through the last rung of the ladder.

213
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:35,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

214
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

215
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:53,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like bringing up for me like some comments that I heard at that meeting about the transfer fee, which were like somebody saying, well, sort of accusing the city council of running like a social service agency, which seems like actually a nice thing to be.

216
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:53,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

217
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:57,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like many cities offer social services.

218
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that is like one of the things that cities do.

219
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:04,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have, yeah, and like I plug her all the time, but our city social worker is like awesome.

220
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:06,309
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's one person, right?

221
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,132
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have one, I know.

222
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:09,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the...

223
00:21:10,114 --> 00:21:14,796
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that, yeah, just like the sort of unseen needs that definitely exist here.

224
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:19,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, yeah, I think that that is like a sad thing to try to accuse.

225
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:21,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, God forbid somebody needs social services.

226
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:23,360
[SPEAKER_01]: God forbid you do sometime.

227
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:23,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

228
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,763
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and yeah, like, like, that's what I think that's what people sometimes don't understand is that, like,

229
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:41,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not particularly religious, but for the grace of God, go I. We're all on the cusp of, at any point, some horrible thing could befall any of us.

230
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:50,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the responsibility of local government is to have these things available for people if they need them.

231
00:21:50,998 --> 00:22:00,504
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody who comes to meetings and says things to me that are maybe sometimes not nice, I want them to know that I

232
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,513
[SPEAKER_01]: still, I want to help them.

233
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:06,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be available to help them if they need help.

234
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:15,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if they don't like the way that I talk or move my face or body, I still want to help them if they need help.

235
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,292
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I ran for this position.

236
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:27,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I have these conversations with the guests that we help with the Malden Warming Center sometimes where it's like, maybe they are annoyed at me.

237
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:30,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they are resistant to the things that we're offering.

238
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they don't like the meal that night.

239
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:34,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they don't like the blanket that we're giving out.

240
00:22:34,882 --> 00:22:36,804
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually had a lot of problems with blankets this year.

241
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Our laundry service was not good.

242
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:41,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we didn't have blankets.

243
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:46,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to apologize to everybody and get up front and be like, listen guys, we don't have blankets tonight.

244
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:55,376
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm really sorry, we can turn the heat up, you can get an extra sweatshirt from the donation closet, but like, I'm really sorry we don't have blankets.

245
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:59,840
[SPEAKER_01]: You can complain to me about it, and I will hear you out, but I'm sorry.

246
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:11,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, as much as you want to complain to me, and as much as you want to say, why do you make me wait outside when it's cold, and I have to wait until seven o'clock, why are you doing this to me?

247
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:14,691
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I know, it stinks, and I also hate it.

248
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:22,129
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's because I just can't get here until 630, and then we have to clean the chairs, and then you guys can come in.

249
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, like, complain to me.

250
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:24,391
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.

251
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's OK.

252
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:29,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want to help you, even though you're yelling at me.

253
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:30,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

254
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,438
[SPEAKER_03]: It does kind of, like, remind me of the pace of city government, right?

255
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,000
[SPEAKER_03]: When people are saying, like, nothing's happened.

256
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, like, whatever.

257
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think you haven't done anything in two years, or whatever that accusation is.

258
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:42,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, you know, you have to wash the chairs, whatever it is.

259
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:43,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

260
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:47,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that feels like a great place to kind of wrap up.

261
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:53,329
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm wondering if there's anything else that you want to plug or any ways you want to share, people can be in touch with you if they want to be.

262
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, absolutely.

263
00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:13,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things that we want as part of our public participation, the rules change that we that we put in, and we went from five minutes to three minutes, we changed the amount of time per agenda item, but we also are implementing listening sessions, which we're going to hammer out the details of that soon.

264
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:14,243
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really excited about it.

265
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:30,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll put that on the website, we'll try to share that on social media as much as we can, but we're also going to have an online form that people can fill out if they want, like if they can't make it to a meeting or they can't be on Zoom, if they want something read into the record,

266
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:37,674
[SPEAKER_01]: They can do an online form, or they can fill out a form in person in the clerk's office, and then we will read it into the record.

267
00:24:37,694 --> 00:24:41,976
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be part of the meeting, and it'll be in the minutes.

268
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:43,117
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be part of the record.

269
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,798
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great way to have your voice heard.

270
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:52,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody in the room hears it, and it's officially part of the record, which is cool.

271
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:54,427
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also always email us.

272
00:24:54,447 --> 00:24:55,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Our emails are right on the website.

273
00:24:56,988 --> 00:24:57,848
[SPEAKER_01]: We read everything.

274
00:24:58,048 --> 00:25:01,410
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't have time to respond, we definitely read it.

275
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Often we respond.

276
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you send it to everybody, at least a handful of people will respond.

277
00:25:06,912 --> 00:25:10,733
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't all respond to each other because it's open meeting law violation.

278
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:21,058
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the listening sessions are going to be really fun and interesting and a great way for us to, in smaller groups, kind of interact with people.

279
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,169
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to seeing how that goes.

280
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:25,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like people.

281
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's none of us are introverts.

282
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:34,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of thrive in environments where there are a lot of people around.

283
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:40,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm looking forward to, uh, meeting more people one-on-one.

284
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:41,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks.

285
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:42,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

286
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:43,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being here.

287
00:25:43,463 --> 00:25:44,044
