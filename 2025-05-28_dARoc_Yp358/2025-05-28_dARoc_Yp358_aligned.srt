00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:28,819
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:42,004
I am John Petrella, and the purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

3
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:50,347
Our guest for the show today is Nate Merritt, better known as the kid from Riverside.

4
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:57,981
The reason Nate is joining us today is Nate is a candidate for our Medford City Council.

5
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:06,344
And I would also like to mention that Nate is often, I mean often, in attendance at city council meetings.

6
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:11,366
He speaks up on issues and concerns for the residents of Medford.

7
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:15,767
So I want to thank you, Nate, for joining us today.

8
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:19,368
Looking forward to you answering some questions.

9
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:21,129
So welcome to the show.

10
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,881
Thanks for having me, John.

11
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:24,402
OK.

12
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:30,286
So the first question, or what I always like to start off with is, who's Nate Merritt?

13
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:32,568
Give us a little background.

14
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,969
Tell us about yourself.

15
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,769
All right.

16
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:35,309
Well, thank you.

17
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,430
Thanks for the opportunity.

18
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:38,492
So my name's Nate.

19
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:43,996
I'm actually a systems engineer, bachelor's and master's out of UMass Amherst.

20
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,117
I've been working as an engineer for 17 years.

21
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,940
I was born and raised in Western Mass, so I am not from Medford.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,840
Oh, OK.

23
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,521
Interesting.

24
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:57,985
I moved out here in around 2009 and met my wife.

25
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:01,207
And I actually knew her from college before, but we got together.

26
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:03,849
And yeah, so my mom was a nurse.

27
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:05,850
My dad was a fireman.

28
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,852
And he was on the job for 30 years.

29
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,414
And I grew up on a small tree farm.

30
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:14,215
And it's something I still keep up today.

31
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:22,364
So I myself went to the fire service, and it's funny, because my dad would say, son, don't go into the fire service.

32
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:23,625
There's a lot of politics.

33
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:24,186
Right.

34
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:28,471
So, well, sorry, dad, because not once, now, but twice.

35
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,132
Yeah.

36
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:33,837
So I'm actually 25 years now as a MAS certified EMT.

37
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:42,484
and I'm a private pilot, husband, I got two young boys, they're great, and I bought my home on Riverside Ave in 2014.

38
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:51,491
About five months later, after first buying my home, my welcome to Medford was a car crashing through my front yard, taking out my whole front fence, and it hit the building next door.

39
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,112
Riverside Ave.

40
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:55,954
And that's what brought me to the City Council my first time.

41
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:59,916
There was something happening at the building next door.

42
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:05,680
They were going to open a business and I was worried about the traffic flow because it's probably one of the strangest intersections.

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,362
You can see where the stoplight is before the driveway.

44
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:12,184
And so I just raised a concern because of the traffic flow.

45
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:13,365
I didn't want to see anyone else get hurt.

46
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:19,249
So that brought me to City Council and since then I've tried to offer practical solutions

47
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:24,189
whenever I can, not just be a complainer, but try to offer some solutions.

48
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:33,834
So for example, and I don't even remember when it was, but there was talk of needing money for, I don't know if it was the fire station, the library, so on and so forth.

49
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:42,378
Instead of raising taxes, I said, hey, what if you gave people the option in their property tax bill to make a donation?

50
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:46,180
And if you look in the upper right corner of your property tax bill,

51
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:54,044
you'll see a spot to make a donation for the library, the police station, or the fire department.

52
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:58,929
And that was an idea I came up with during public comments at a city council meeting.

53
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:59,989
So obviously, someone heard me.

54
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:03,285
They took your advice, it was a good idea.

55
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:04,006
And there we go.

56
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:06,047
Yeah, that's a good thing.

57
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,389
I'm a person I believe in limited government.

58
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,873
We're five miles from a group of people 250 years ago that maybe thought the same thing.

59
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:18,255
So that said, government should work for the people.

60
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:20,446
and not necessarily the other way around.

61
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:24,668
And we should always be careful if we're infringing on individual liberties.

62
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,088
That's what this country was founded on.

63
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,889
But I also understand the need for government.

64
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:29,550
It's a balance.

65
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,371
Yes, it is.

66
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:36,153
And your father, like I said, you're really getting into politics now.

67
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:42,059
So, all right, so you gave us a good introduction there.

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,726
You know, what reasons are making you run for a seat on the City Council?

69
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:53,331
I mean, you know, why do you want the job?

70
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,134
I'll be honest with you, John, I don't want the job.

71
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:05,358
I'd much rather be at home playing with my kids and spending time at city council meetings even now and I've said that before.

72
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:11,480
But I think unfortunately we can either complain about it or we can do something about it.

73
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,202
So I'm at the point where it's time to try to do something.

74
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:16,843
I think we need to give a voice back to the people.

75
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:25,987
I think, unfortunately, the way things have been running for the past two years, for example, you look at recent meetings that have happened zoning, especially in Salem Street.

76
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:31,230
And I was there and I saw people for hours sitting there making comments and concerns.

77
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,852
And there was, you know, the Community Development Board had incorporated

78
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:42,608
suggestions from, you know, the residents, and I watched a city councilor just say, yeah, I don't like that.

79
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:45,829
Change it and just go their own way.

80
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:47,810
And to me, that's not sad.

81
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:52,592
I think that I can also start giving some critical thought to some issues.

82
00:05:52,652 --> 00:06:04,197
I think that people are maybe good intentioned, but I think we need to start weighing pros and cons of things, and especially always asking the question, how does it benefit the residents of Medford today?

83
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:06,359
That's awesome.

84
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:07,360
That should be number one.

85
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,983
Always should be the residents of Medford.

86
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:10,623
Absolutely.

87
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:19,432
So, honestly, I'm kind of tired of sitting back and watching the agenda removing the rights of our citizens.

88
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,834
So we have rent control on the table.

89
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,476
You've got a tree ordinance coming up.

90
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:24,337
You've got zoning.

91
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:26,198
I saw what happened with the charter.

92
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:26,899
Right.

93
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,722
And same thing where the voice of the people was lost.

94
00:06:30,062 --> 00:06:30,423
Correct.

95
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:31,424
Unilaterally.

96
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:31,865
Okay.

97
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:39,336
I think our sense of community is deteriorating and there's an agenda and it's being plowed forward.

98
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:41,840
They're plowing forward with it, John.

99
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,381
Okay.

100
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:44,044
No, I agree.

101
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:44,764
I agree.

102
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:45,565
I hear you.

103
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,107
So that's a good answer.

104
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,568
Great answer, actually.

105
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,211
So, you know, you've given us some good reasons.

106
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:58,315
Those are good reasons why you're running for a seat on the city council.

107
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,184
And I'm going to ask you this question.

108
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:05,106
But I've been to City Hall.

109
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,927
I've seen you offer solutions.

110
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,470
As a matter of fact, you seem to offer a lot of solutions.

111
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,072
But, you know, I'm going to go ahead and ask.

112
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:17,794
I mean, what solutions do you have?

113
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:24,279
You can just pick out one or two from the answers you just gave me.

114
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,900
But what solutions?

115
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:33,895
Are you going to, do you think you can come up with or you have for the concerns you just told us about?

116
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:42,741
Well, I think something that could be done even today is, you know, sometimes these city council meetings go long and there's a lot of people that want to be heard.

117
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,662
And I've been there till 12, 1 in the morning.

118
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:53,389
And I've seen people that want to talk, and they go home because they have jobs in the morning or, you know, right?

119
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:54,850
They just can't stay up that late.

120
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,993
And I've seen sometimes where the agendas have been rejiggered.

121
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:02,438
And we're talking about national issues that

122
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:08,375
The city of Medford can impact, but we're sucking the oxygen out of the room instead of dealing with the local ones.

123
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:13,838
And people wanna speak about the local issues, but that gets tabled until after 11, 12 p.m.

124
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:21,362
So I think something we could do is if the meeting runs past 11 o'clock, we're done, shut it down, table the rest of the agenda to the next week.

125
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:22,923
Everyone should be heard.

126
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:25,204
And when it's running that late, that's not fair to anybody.

127
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,886
And we shouldn't be making decisions literally in the dark of the night.

128
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:30,187
No, and I think everyone,

129
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:38,267
has seen that happen, I mean, on more than one occasion, where the meetings have gone incredibly late.

130
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:46,973
And, you know, I'll just chime in with, I've been there where important issues get pushed back.

131
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:58,440
And there'd be talk, you've, we're both in the same room, where national issues would come into play, they discuss those first, nothing to do with Medford.

132
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:08,906
And then you had a key issue like the charter commission, you know, what's going on with the charter, and boy, we wouldn't get started until 10 o'clock at night on some of that stuff.

133
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:12,288
And a lot of people do have to go to work and everything else.

134
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:17,812
So, you know, good answers, good answers, Nate.

135
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,713
I appreciate the honesty, too.

136
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:21,134
And that's a big thing.

137
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:27,338
You know, do you see any steps being taken

138
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,362
you know, by the current administration, you know, to resolve some of these issues you just talked about.

139
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:41,364
Is there anything going on that you think is going to resolve these issues?

140
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:43,945
Do you think it's possible to resolve?

141
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:44,905
Put it that way.

142
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:49,007
I think people are trying, but, John, if everything was hunky-dory, I wouldn't be running.

143
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:50,227
Okay.

144
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:52,840
I'll be honest with you.

145
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:00,562
I think that the administration needs to really consider doing an audit of the city finances.

146
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:07,785
We're talking $5 million that's missing from the school committee budget and then found and $34 million.

147
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,127
We're making Enron and Arthur Anderson look good here.

148
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,047
That's nothing to laugh about.

149
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:17,970
Good answer, yeah, I hear ya, I hear ya.

150
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,834
I think that in terms of the sense of community, there's a lot of red tape.

151
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:24,075
I'm gonna tell you a story real quick.

152
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:26,276
So, I told you I got little guys.

153
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:28,838
One of my favorite parks I like to go to is Logan Park.

154
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:35,063
There, there's a little fire truck, like playground thing for kids to go play, little kids to play on.

155
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:35,283
Right.

156
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:43,650
And I had my son with me and I noticed the wooden boards were, they were in rough shape and I didn't want my kid to get splinters or any other kid.

157
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,290
Yeah.

158
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,391
So I called the mayor's office, wrote an email, said, Hey, listen, this is a couple boards.

159
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,232
I get it.

160
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:50,892
I'm willing to go fix it.

161
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:55,833
I don't want to just go start ripping up, you know, pressure treated wood and putting bolts in.

162
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:57,114
I'll have the cops down.

163
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:58,934
Yeah.

164
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,955
So I said, Hey, can I get some top cover and just let them know what I'm willing to do?

165
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,896
And this is on my own nickel, my own time.

166
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:08,257
This is sawing a couple boards and installing a couple carriage bolts and nuts.

167
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:09,317
This isn't rocket science.

168
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:10,017
I'm an engineer.

169
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:11,358
This is not rocket science.

170
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:11,858
I hear you.

171
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:19,185
It became a whole production and I talked with, you know, she put me in touch with some of the parks folks and nothing.

172
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,547
And then a couple months later it got fixed.

173
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:25,190
And meanwhile, I've got to watch my kid like a hawk and I'm working like for everybody.

174
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,915
And this was initially something that was donated to the city by a resident.

175
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:35,039
So it's not like the city wound up purchasing it or something originally either.

176
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,622
So there are people willing to do

177
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:42,070
you know, help out the community and not necessarily for any money.

178
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,173
I mean, that's volunteerism and that's a good thing.

179
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:44,473
Yeah.

180
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:44,833
Yeah.

181
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:51,040
I think if we had a better sense of community and maybe we find a way to eliminate some of the red tape, you'll find people who are willing to pitch in.

182
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:52,482
Yeah, I agree with you.

183
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:54,324
And that's, that's a good point.

184
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:58,287
You know, that's what we would call a small issue.

185
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:03,710
Important, nonetheless, but that's a good point because it's the little things.

186
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:09,113
And, you know, there's a lot of people in this city that will do the little things.

187
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:10,693
That's the bottom line.

188
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:14,935
So, you know, I appreciate that.

189
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:16,576
I really do.

190
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:18,257
Small stuff matters.

191
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:29,453
A lot of talk, you mentioned real quick the zoning in Medford, and there's so much going on right now with the zoning.

192
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:41,223
And meetings and people, it's on Zoom, and a lot of people, I gotta be honest, they don't know too much about all the zoning, what's going on.

193
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:45,326
What's your position on zoning?

194
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,268
It's coming to Medford, I mean, they're doing things.

195
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:49,449
What's your position on it?

196
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,510
Do you have a position?

197
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:56,867
I think that zoning is a huge concern overall, and I know there's a lot of chatter about it.

198
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:02,811
I think my personal view is it's something we should look at, but it's like everything else, right?

199
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:10,757
Extremes are not necessarily good in general, in any system, in any government, in any operation.

200
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:17,179
So that said, I think right now what we're seeing is essentially it could be mass gentrification.

201
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,082
There's a lot of rezoning happening all at once.

202
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:21,163
I'll give you an example again.

203
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,925
There's a talk of we need more affordable housing.

204
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,148
I ask the question, what is affordable to you?

205
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:31,252
I have two kids in daycare.

206
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:31,772
I have a mortgage.

207
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:39,360
And all the other expenses that go along with that.

208
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:46,087
And I still somehow afford it, but we've had to make choices along the way.

209
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:56,118
So more supply in the city of Medford, I don't think is gonna move the needle at all in terms of the cost of rent, the cost of mortgage.

210
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,261
So we're going to go increase the supply.

211
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:04,403
And I heard from a city councilor that said, well, I'm not going to go explain the details of supply and demand.

212
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:05,484
I got it.

213
00:14:06,164 --> 00:14:07,925
But this is like attacking a tank with a toothpick.

214
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:12,687
Because there are greater economic forces at play than anything the city of Medford can influence.

215
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,588
So why are we addressing the zoning to begin with?

216
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,709
Is it for the needs of the residents?

217
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:20,330
And what's the benefit for the current residents of the city?

218
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,808
So, my concern with the zoning really is more about the commercial and the industrial side.

219
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:26,529
Okay.

220
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:31,850
A lot of people don't know this, but commercial and industrial pay twice the amount the residents do.

221
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:37,792
And for every commercial business or industrial zone you lose, who picks up the tab?

222
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:39,473
The other commercial businesses.

223
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:40,113
Right.

224
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:40,873
Yep.

225
00:14:41,354 --> 00:14:42,074
And the residents.

226
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:42,334
Yep.

227
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,054
And you're talking taxes.

228
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:45,475
That's what you're basically talking.

229
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:46,913
Correct.

230
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:51,337
I'm talking taxes, but also wear and tear on your services.

231
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:54,499
Your fire, your police, your EMS, your roads, your schools.

232
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,159
That's correct.

233
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,141
All that has to be taken into consideration.

234
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:00,403
My house is a single family house.

235
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:01,964
That's why I came to Medford.

236
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,706
I wanted a single family home, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

237
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:07,428
Some people are meant for condos, and I'm not one of them.

238
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:07,829
Right.

239
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:08,369
That's fine.

240
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:10,090
That's part of what attracted us to Medford.

241
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:19,458
We know how that right now my house under the new plan will be zoned for three family So they will tear my house down.

242
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:20,739
They'll buy it from me for whatever.

243
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:28,926
Let's say we're 750 today Yeah, someone else could buy it for 750 000 and have their family And and and use a starter house.

244
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:32,068
Yeah instead Contractor's gonna come

245
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:38,784
buy it, tear it down, turn it into a triplex, and sell each unit for a million dollars.

246
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,206
Who's that affordable for?

247
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:44,651
I agree with you.

248
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:46,554
It's always been about choice.

249
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:59,090
I guess my opinion, it would be nice to see some affordable housing in the city, but there's a limit.

250
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:00,751
It's how you go about it.

251
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,572
I mean, I agree with most of what you're saying.

252
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:06,093
You're making some good points here.

253
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:10,894
So you're making some very good points.

254
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:14,536
So okay, let's move from that.

255
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:18,677
Let's get on to, it's no secret.

256
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:26,360
You mentioned it, economic growth in Metfin, best described as stagnant.

257
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,481
I mean, I think everyone's aware of that.

258
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,603
It's no secret.

259
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:36,667
So as far as spending and taxes go, do you have priorities?

260
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:37,648
Do you have a plan?

261
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:42,632
I mean, what would you, you get elected to the city council, what are you looking to do?

262
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,748
I think the question isn't how do we get economic growth.

263
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,912
The city is not a publicly traded Wall Street company.

264
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:52,594
What's the metric?

265
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:54,035
And I've asked that publicly before.

266
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:58,140
It's not revenue dollars coming in and every year you want more revenue.

267
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:03,685
There is no earnings ratio on the city.

268
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:07,489
The metric in this case should be sustainment.

269
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:09,484
That's what we should be looking at.

270
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:13,828
And when you have industry leaving, that's a problem.

271
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,330
We need to fix that.

272
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,912
It's not growth, it's just keeping what we have at a minimum.

273
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,233
Let's try to work that.

274
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:23,417
Example, August Bush, down on Riverside Ave.

275
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:28,802
Before the overrides came in, right, they probably read the tea leaves and they had a choice to make.

276
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:31,505
Do they operate out of Quincy or do they operate out of Medford?

277
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:33,271
They chose Quincy.

278
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:34,191
OK.

279
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:37,752
So now, the latest I heard, you tell me if you've heard any different.

280
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:41,253
I know Market Basket was maybe considering it, but so was the MBTA.

281
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,814
And the MBTA is the lead bidder.

282
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:45,855
They're the highest bidder last I heard.

283
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:46,495
Right.

284
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:51,176
That's over 20 acres, and it's like 24 acres of property, commercial property.

285
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:52,137
Yes, yeah.

286
00:17:52,597 --> 00:18:00,399
So if the MBTA winds up actually purchasing that property, that's 24 acres worth of commercial tax revenue gone.

287
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:06,662
Because the MBTA, they'll pay the permits and fees to build their structures, but then they don't owe a dime for taxes afterwards.

288
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:12,846
So that burden is going to shift to the remaining commercial industrial.

289
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,387
And this just begins quicksand.

290
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:16,008
It's a spiral.

291
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:27,684
So I think, and there's plenty of vacant commercial buildings, it's not just in Medford, I've seen it actually in Malden too, near where the Aviva Trattoria is, near Exchange Street in Malden.

292
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,766
Big sign, 300,000 square feet available.

293
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:35,887
Across the street from my house, 400 Riverside Ave, 100,000 square feet available.

294
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,188
Yeah, I've seen those signs too, yep, yep.

295
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:43,551
I think we really should be focusing on and talking with them, how do we get these buildings filled?

296
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:45,992
In terms of the local area,

297
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:48,373
You've got Wooburn.

298
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:51,014
Wooburn's got a lot of industry.

299
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:58,337
When people want to go build buildings here, they go to Wooburn to go get their heavy equipment, to get their building materials.

300
00:18:58,797 --> 00:18:59,738
They buy steel there.

301
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:05,060
These aren't things that necessarily negatively impact the surrounding community.

302
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,340
In fact, they've done a really good job.

303
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:07,141
Malden.

304
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:11,323
Malden's got the Panadosi Bakery.

305
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:12,503
They make bread.

306
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:14,084
You've got the New England Coffee.

307
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:14,984
They have a lot.

308
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:16,305
You've got National Grid.

309
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:18,869
What are we making, Medford?

310
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:20,630
No, I hear ya.

311
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,110
Sausage.

312
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,371
Yeah, no, I hear ya.

313
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,132
I love Bianco sausage, don't get me wrong.

314
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:24,672
Yeah, me too, me too.

315
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:25,133
Great product.

316
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:26,954
But that's what we're making now, is sausage.

317
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:28,995
Good plugin for Bianco's.

318
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,617
Absolutely, if you've never been to Bianco's, go.

319
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:32,177
Good stuff.

320
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:33,578
I love the chicken sausage.

321
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:34,238
Good stuff.

322
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:39,161
We have vocational schools, we're one of the few in the area, we should be promoting that.

323
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:43,704
Unit Man's the nearest one, that's up in Lexington, and a lot of people don't wanna drive that far.

324
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,425
And we gotta use the river,

325
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,411
We're unique.

326
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:55,458
We've got a river, we've got interstate access, we've got major routes and highways, and we've got the T. We should be capitalizing on that and fostering it.

327
00:19:56,258 --> 00:20:08,529
I think that river's going to, if it's even up the square, and I'm not, but if things get done right, and if people really look into it, that could be a big revenue driver.

328
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:14,334
Anything that brings people from out of the city into the city to spend money and support the local economy.

329
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:14,994
Okay.

330
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,796
Yeah, no, I hear you.

331
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:22,059
So it's more commercial, industrial.

332
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,281
Spending and taxes.

333
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:28,583
Spending and taxes.

334
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:34,386
We can go on for weeks, but we're not going to, but we could.

335
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,448
I know a lot of people

336
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:42,136
talk, you know, there's all different sides to this story.

337
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:52,587
The two basic sides are, you know, control your spending, you know, let's really take a look at what you have and, you know,

338
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:56,888
Right now, it looks like they're just looking for more taxes, taxes.

339
00:20:56,948 --> 00:21:05,092
But, you know, the bottom line is, as far as spending and taxes, what do you think?

340
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,712
I mean, do you have any priorities?

341
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:09,033
How do you feel about that Barlow X?

342
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:17,717
I think the fact that we passed two overrides, and don't take my word for it, look at the video.

343
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:20,658
You had the city council president and you had the mayor dancing.

344
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:30,291
at the thought, not the thought, but at the fact that people now are only paying only $400 more a year in their taxes.

345
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:31,651
How's that working out?

346
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:35,031
That's my thought.

347
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:37,872
I mean, spending is necessary.

348
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:43,573
Sometimes tax increases are necessary, but nobody should ever be happy about it, and certainly nobody should ever be excited.

349
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:48,114
I think that was the wrong attitude to have on that, and that was a little unprofessional.

350
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:52,857
So that said, also, we've got a lot of lawsuits happening in the city.

351
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:53,998
That needs to stop.

352
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:55,519
That's not doing anybody any favors.

353
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:57,000
And that's a waste of taxpayer money.

354
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,821
And then there's other little gems, which I get it.

355
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:01,803
You want to pay people.

356
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,263
You want to have nice things.

357
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:10,028
But when you go back to the well, now you've got to start really taking a hard look and understanding what are my needs versus my wants.

358
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:12,109
I deal with this with my kids.

359
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,871
We all do.

360
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:18,514
And when I see that we're paying two grand a year for a poet laureate.

361
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:19,054
Yep.

362
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:24,338
But you asked for 500,000 for roads and streets.

363
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:24,799
Right.

364
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,381
I got to wonder what else is going on.

365
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:35,827
And again, when you start seeing millions that are going missing and people refuse to do an audit, again, this is making Enron look good folks.

366
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:36,368
Yep.

367
00:22:36,528 --> 00:22:36,868
Okay.

368
00:22:37,248 --> 00:22:37,448
Yep.

369
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:38,049
I hear you.

370
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,700
I hear you.

371
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:40,900
All right.

372
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,922
So, you know, let's get on to something else now.

373
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,922
You did not attend school here.

374
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:51,483
I think, I guess you've lived here for around 10 years, you said.

375
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:56,145
So, you know, Meffitt has rich history.

376
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,425
I love history.

377
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:00,266
That's me personally.

378
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:01,786
Always a big history fan.

379
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:05,087
But, so you've only been here for 10 years.

380
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:07,308
What do you think about the history in Meffitt

381
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,552
I mean, what do you know about the history of method?

382
00:23:12,612 --> 00:23:13,255
Put it that way.

383
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,078
There's a few things in Medford, right?

384
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:18,658
And you're correct.

385
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:24,839
Normally, the things you would learn in school, I didn't have that opportunity, because I know about the things instead in Western Mass.

386
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:25,459
Right.

387
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:40,963
In my school, we learned about General Knox, and he went and captured a whole bunch of cannons from Fort Ticonderoga and brought a little caravan through the state of Massachusetts, including my hometown, what's now Route 20, and parked them on Dorchester Heights and liberated Boston.

388
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:44,457
So that's one of the things that brought my hometown to fame.

389
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:45,778
Medford built clipper ships.

390
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:47,819
Medford had brickyards.

391
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:57,267
Paul Revere rode through on the way to go warn about the British trying to interfere with some patriots over in Lexington and Concord.

392
00:23:58,968 --> 00:23:59,829
Apparently there's some rum.

393
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:01,644
that Medford is known for.

394
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:02,805
Yeah, Medford made some good rum, yeah.

395
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:03,425
I've never had it.

396
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:05,867
I heard the recipe's still around, but I've never had it.

397
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:09,451
Yeah, I heard someone's bringing it back, so that'll be interesting, yeah.

398
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:14,435
So one of the ways I learned some of the history is from the Mystic River Bend Park.

399
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:19,399
It's down behind the McGlynn schools and around the corner from where I live.

400
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,863
And so I went and I took some pictures yesterday.

401
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:26,725
I went out in the rain because I wanted to make sure my information was accurate.

402
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:30,668
The signs look about the same rough shape that they did when I first saw them.

403
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:31,268
Right.

404
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:36,210
And it's sad because, I mean, we have community preservation funding.

405
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:39,272
To me, this is literally preserving your community.

406
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,993
It's in the name, Community Preservation Act.

407
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:41,433
That's it.

408
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,914
Some of those signs are unfortunately in such disrepair.

409
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,375
There's graffiti on them.

410
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:45,815
Right.

411
00:24:45,835 --> 00:24:53,919
And there's a lot of great info that talk about the river, how it used to be salt marshes and where throughout the years where it changed the ecology.

412
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,439
Right.

413
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,240
Now there's graffiti on them and they're barely readable.

414
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,980
One of them looks like it was melted in the sun or something.

415
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:00,540
Yeah.

416
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,160
It's a shame.

417
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,540
Right.

418
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,421
I think we really should be taking care of our city better.

419
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:04,901
Yeah.

420
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:07,581
And little things like that go a long way.

421
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:09,842
But it's probably been like that for almost 10 years.

422
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:10,222
Yeah.

423
00:25:10,362 --> 00:25:18,963
Well, like I said, you're looking at some, I like looking at the little things, a lot of big things, but you know, it's nice that you're looking at some of the little things too that matter.

424
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:21,364
They're little, but they matter.

425
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:22,144
But if you show

426
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,991
that you care about your city, maybe you won't get trashed as easily.

427
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:27,332
Right.

428
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:29,052
Now, yeah, I hear you.

429
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:29,833
I hear you.

430
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:30,713
I really do.

431
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,054
Um, some great answers.

432
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:35,735
Uh, all right.

433
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:40,717
So I'm just gonna basically, you know, these are more like personal questions, silly questions.

434
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:45,919
I don't know what you want to call them, but, um, you know, we're going to have some other candidates on.

435
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,679
I like to just find out little things.

436
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:49,060
So, uh,

437
00:25:50,563 --> 00:25:57,990
What would you say are the least and your most favorite things for you to do in Method?

438
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:03,295
So, I mean, you know, there's got to be things you love to do and maybe some things you don't like to do.

439
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:03,975
I don't know.

440
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:05,377
Give it a shot.

441
00:26:05,457 --> 00:26:06,037
What do you think?

442
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:06,538
Sure.

443
00:26:09,305 --> 00:26:16,113
I'm a father with young kids, so I don't get to go out as much as I want, as much as I used to.

444
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:19,197
Usually, my fun things now involve them.

445
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:24,323
I'll say, fresh donuts over at Donuts with a Difference.

446
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:25,964
Because that's unique.

447
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:26,725
Good choice.

448
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:32,908
Remember, I grew up when Dunkin' Donuts used to make all the donuts in every store, and the old man was there, time to make the donuts.

449
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:37,071
So it's a unique thing that we have, and I love their donuts.

450
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:37,891
They're awesome.

451
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:39,592
I bring them to work with me when I can.

452
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:40,173
People love them.

453
00:26:42,574 --> 00:26:46,936
The various parks in the city, I'm involved using those.

454
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:49,398
They're great.

455
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:51,359
But that's what I spend a lot of my time doing.

456
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,860
As far as things I don't like,

457
00:26:54,448 --> 00:27:00,833
Well, I'd be remiss if I said, you know, going to city council meetings, but I'll be honest with you, staying up until 12 o'clock at night, going to city council meetings.

458
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:01,313
Yeah.

459
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:02,274
I don't, I don't love that.

460
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:04,256
I don't think anyone loves it.

461
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:04,576
Yeah.

462
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:04,936
Right.

463
00:27:05,617 --> 00:27:15,304
And, uh, driving down my street, I don't know what am I driving down roads in the city of Medford or am I in a, you know, looking at Germany, occupied France and world war II.

464
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:17,093
Not sure.

465
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:18,154
A few potholes, huh?

466
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:19,114
A couple potholes.

467
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:20,694
Not sure what happened here.

468
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:21,895
Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.

469
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:23,335
Maybe I like a little bit of history.

470
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:24,436
Yeah, yeah.

471
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,777
No, that's, you know, good answer, good answer.

472
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:35,240
And, you know, I remember, you know, I had two children, and I remember back when they were young, he did a lot of, you know, everything is for the kids.

473
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,560
I mean, that's the way it should be.

474
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,601
And CB Scoops.

475
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:38,961
Oh, yeah, CB Scoops.

476
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:40,101
That's one of the things we love.

477
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:41,002
The kids love it.

478
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:41,602
We go there.

479
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:42,062
Yeah.

480
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:43,002
Right, it's great.

481
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:43,463
So, yeah.

482
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,824
You're dealing with the kids.

483
00:27:46,864 --> 00:27:48,124
You're at that level.

484
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:48,584
I know.

485
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:49,385
I feel you.

486
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:50,125
We eat the ice cream.

487
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:51,245
We watch the train go by.

488
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:52,166
My kid loves trains.

489
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:53,326
We literally get to see the train.

490
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:54,867
And we'll sit there and just watch the bell.

491
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:56,047
I miss those days.

492
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,248
You're bringing back good memories for me.

493
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,591
We're getting down on time here.

494
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,312
So I do want to ask you.

495
00:28:11,852 --> 00:28:12,833
I always ask this.

496
00:28:15,097 --> 00:28:26,167
You know, growing up in Method my whole life, if I wanted to go find someone, I always, you know, depending on who it was, I knew where I could go find them, put it that way.

497
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:38,016
If I wanted to find you, if I wanted to get in touch with you, Mr. Merritt, where in Metford would someone look for you?

498
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:41,458
Someone wanted to meet you, introduce you, whatever, where would they meet you?

499
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,180
Where would be a good place to look?

500
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,841
And I know you're busy, you've got kids, but...

501
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:52,618
If there's a hot topic going on, you might find me at the podium at a city council meeting on a Wednesday night.

502
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:54,160
I've seen you here plenty of times.

503
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:58,305
Like I said, I've attended quite a few of those.

504
00:28:58,886 --> 00:28:59,266
You are.

505
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:00,227
You're always there.

506
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:06,054
One of the things, one of the many things I do like about you is

507
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:07,516
solutions.

508
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:10,301
You're always given solutions.

509
00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:12,705
And that, to me, that's nice.

510
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:18,794
It's a nice thing to hear someone, you know, no screaming, no stomping your feet, but

511
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:24,605
Serious subjects, a lot of serious stuff going on, but I like it.

512
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:28,808
You're offering solutions and that's, you know, that's really important.

513
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,090
So, that's about it.

514
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:35,052
Unfortunately, the show's come to an end.

515
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:37,974
It was a pleasure having you, it really was.

516
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:38,534
Thank you.

517
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:41,677
And I do have an email address that people can reach me at.

518
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,398
Okay, yep, give us the email.

519
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:46,060
It's meritformedford at gmail.com.

520
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,600
Okay.

521
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,861
So, two R's, two T's.

522
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:51,543
And it's F-O-R, not the number four, but that's all right.

523
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,684
And I got a website that I'm working on, but it's not up yet.

524
00:29:54,804 --> 00:29:58,766
So I don't have an apparatus working my campaign.

525
00:29:58,806 --> 00:30:00,967
This is a grassroots, you know, thing, so.

526
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:02,428
I know what it is, yeah, yeah.

527
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:06,369
Takes some time, takes a lot of work, and you're a very busy guy.

528
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,130
But we'll get that up and running.

529
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,392
So in the meantime, the email's good, or come for me at a city council meeting.

530
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:12,648
Thanks, John.

531
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:13,309
Appreciate it.

532
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:14,370
No, thank you, too.

533
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,752
And we'll have you back again.

534
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:19,936
So when you're all set with your other accounts, we'll announce them.

535
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:22,279
So we're going to have you back, I can tell.

536
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,481
So that's it.

537
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:27,104
It's that time again.

538
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:29,486
So I want to thank Nate.

539
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:33,309
First, for joining us on Method Happenings.

540
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:38,911
And I want to thank them for being a candidate for our Method City Council.

541
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:47,535
It's nice to have some new faces, very qualified people running for the city council.

542
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:53,637
I also want to take a minute, I have to thank everyone who has been watching the show.

543
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:56,579
We're getting out in a lot more places.

544
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:59,340
You know, we're getting some more feedback.

545
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,444
Um, and we're getting good and we're getting negative, uh, and I don't care.

546
00:31:04,484 --> 00:31:07,806
We'll take whatever, but it's nice to get the feedback.

547
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:25,440
Um, if you'd like to share any comments or have any suggestions for a show, or if you want to appear on a future show, please, you can contact us at johnpatroller55 at gmail.com.

548
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:28,182
Uh, you know, we'd be glad to have you, uh,

549
00:31:29,312 --> 00:31:34,140
join us on a show and Our show has come to an end.

550
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:40,189
So once again, thank you all for watching and stay informed

551
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:18,895
Ta-da!
