00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:28,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:42,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I am John Petrella, and the purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

3
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:50,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest for the show today is Nate Merritt, better known as the kid from Riverside.

4
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:57,981
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason Nate is joining us today is Nate is a candidate for our Medford City Council.

5
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:06,344
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also like to mention that Nate is often, I mean often, in attendance at city council meetings.

6
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:11,366
[SPEAKER_00]: He speaks up on issues and concerns for the residents of Medford.

7
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:15,767
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you, Nate, for joining us today.

8
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:19,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to you answering some questions.

9
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:21,129
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to the show.

10
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me, John.

11
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:24,402
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

12
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:30,286
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question, or what I always like to start off with is, who's Nate Merritt?

13
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:32,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a little background.

14
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about yourself.

15
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,769
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

16
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:35,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

17
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the opportunity.

18
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:38,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name's Nate.

19
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:43,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually a systems engineer, bachelor's and master's out of UMass Amherst.

20
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working as an engineer for 17 years.

21
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born and raised in Western Mass, so I am not from Medford.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

23
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

24
00:01:52,742 --> 00:01:57,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved out here in around 2009 and met my wife.

25
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:01,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually knew her from college before, but we got together.

26
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:03,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so my mom was a nurse.

27
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:05,850
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad was a fireman.

28
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was on the job for 30 years.

29
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grew up on a small tree farm.

30
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:14,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something I still keep up today.

31
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:22,364
[SPEAKER_02]: So I myself went to the fire service, and it's funny, because my dad would say, son, don't go into the fire service.

32
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:23,625
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of politics.

33
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:24,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

34
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:28,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, sorry, dad, because not once, now, but twice.

35
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

36
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:33,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually 25 years now as a MAS certified EMT.

37
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:42,484
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm a private pilot, husband, I got two young boys, they're great, and I bought my home on Riverside Ave in 2014.

38
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:51,491
[SPEAKER_02]: About five months later, after first buying my home, my welcome to Medford was a car crashing through my front yard, taking out my whole front fence, and it hit the building next door.

39
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Riverside Ave.

40
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:55,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what brought me to the City Council my first time.

41
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:59,916
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something happening at the building next door.

42
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:05,680
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to open a business and I was worried about the traffic flow because it's probably one of the strangest intersections.

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,362
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see where the stoplight is before the driveway.

44
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:12,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just raised a concern because of the traffic flow.

45
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:13,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to see anyone else get hurt.

46
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:19,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So that brought me to City Council and since then I've tried to offer practical solutions

47
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:24,189
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever I can, not just be a complainer, but try to offer some solutions.

48
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:33,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, and I don't even remember when it was, but there was talk of needing money for, I don't know if it was the fire station, the library, so on and so forth.

49
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:42,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of raising taxes, I said, hey, what if you gave people the option in their property tax bill to make a donation?

50
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:46,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look in the upper right corner of your property tax bill,

51
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:54,044
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll see a spot to make a donation for the library, the police station, or the fire department.

52
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:58,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was an idea I came up with during public comments at a city council meeting.

53
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:59,989
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, someone heard me.

54
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:03,285
[SPEAKER_02]: They took your advice, it was a good idea.

55
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:04,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And there we go.

56
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:06,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good thing.

57
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a person I believe in limited government.

58
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,873
[SPEAKER_02]: We're five miles from a group of people 250 years ago that maybe thought the same thing.

59
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:18,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So that said, government should work for the people.

60
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:20,446
[SPEAKER_02]: and not necessarily the other way around.

61
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:24,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should always be careful if we're infringing on individual liberties.

62
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,088
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this country was founded on.

63
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,889
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also understand the need for government.

64
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:29,550
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a balance.

65
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.

66
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:36,153
[SPEAKER_00]: And your father, like I said, you're really getting into politics now.

67
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:42,059
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right, so you gave us a good introduction there.

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,726
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what reasons are making you run for a seat on the City Council?

69
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:53,331
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, why do you want the job?

70
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be honest with you, John, I don't want the job.

71
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:05,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd much rather be at home playing with my kids and spending time at city council meetings even now and I've said that before.

72
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:11,480
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think unfortunately we can either complain about it or we can do something about it.

73
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm at the point where it's time to try to do something.

74
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:16,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to give a voice back to the people.

75
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:25,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, unfortunately, the way things have been running for the past two years, for example, you look at recent meetings that have happened zoning, especially in Salem Street.

76
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:31,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was there and I saw people for hours sitting there making comments and concerns.

77
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was, you know, the Community Development Board had incorporated

78
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:42,608
[SPEAKER_02]: suggestions from, you know, the residents, and I watched a city councilor just say, yeah, I don't like that.

79
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:45,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Change it and just go their own way.

80
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:47,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's not sad.

81
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:52,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I can also start giving some critical thought to some issues.

82
00:05:52,652 --> 00:06:04,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that people are maybe good intentioned, but I think we need to start weighing pros and cons of things, and especially always asking the question, how does it benefit the residents of Medford today?

83
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:06,359
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.

84
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:07,360
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be number one.

85
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Always should be the residents of Medford.

86
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:10,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

87
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:19,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So, honestly, I'm kind of tired of sitting back and watching the agenda removing the rights of our citizens.

88
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have rent control on the table.

89
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,476
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a tree ordinance coming up.

90
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:24,337
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got zoning.

91
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:26,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw what happened with the charter.

92
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:26,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

93
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And same thing where the voice of the people was lost.

94
00:06:30,062 --> 00:06:30,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

95
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:31,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Unilaterally.

96
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:31,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

97
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:39,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our sense of community is deteriorating and there's an agenda and it's being plowed forward.

98
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:41,840
[SPEAKER_02]: They're plowing forward with it, John.

99
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

100
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:44,044
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree.

101
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:44,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

102
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:45,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.

103
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,107
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good answer.

104
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer, actually.

105
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,211
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you've given us some good reasons.

106
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:58,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are good reasons why you're running for a seat on the city council.

107
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,184
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to ask you this question.

108
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:05,106
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been to City Hall.

109
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,927
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you offer solutions.

110
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,470
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, you seem to offer a lot of solutions.

111
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,072
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm going to go ahead and ask.

112
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:17,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what solutions do you have?

113
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:24,279
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just pick out one or two from the answers you just gave me.

114
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,900
[SPEAKER_00]: But what solutions?

115
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:33,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to, do you think you can come up with or you have for the concerns you just told us about?

116
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:42,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think something that could be done even today is, you know, sometimes these city council meetings go long and there's a lot of people that want to be heard.

117
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,662
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been there till 12, 1 in the morning.

118
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:53,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen people that want to talk, and they go home because they have jobs in the morning or, you know, right?

119
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:54,850
[SPEAKER_02]: They just can't stay up that late.

120
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen sometimes where the agendas have been rejiggered.

121
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:02,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about national issues that

122
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:08,375
[SPEAKER_02]: The city of Medford can impact, but we're sucking the oxygen out of the room instead of dealing with the local ones.

123
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:13,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And people wanna speak about the local issues, but that gets tabled until after 11, 12 p.m.

124
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:21,362
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think something we could do is if the meeting runs past 11 o'clock, we're done, shut it down, table the rest of the agenda to the next week.

125
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:22,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone should be heard.

126
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:25,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it's running that late, that's not fair to anybody.

127
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And we shouldn't be making decisions literally in the dark of the night.

128
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:30,187
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and I think everyone,

129
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:38,267
[SPEAKER_00]: has seen that happen, I mean, on more than one occasion, where the meetings have gone incredibly late.

130
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:46,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'll just chime in with, I've been there where important issues get pushed back.

131
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:58,440
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'd be talk, you've, we're both in the same room, where national issues would come into play, they discuss those first, nothing to do with Medford.

132
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:08,906
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had a key issue like the charter commission, you know, what's going on with the charter, and boy, we wouldn't get started until 10 o'clock at night on some of that stuff.

133
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:12,288
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people do have to go to work and everything else.

134
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:17,812
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, good answers, good answers, Nate.

135
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,713
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the honesty, too.

136
00:09:20,213 --> 00:09:21,134
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big thing.

137
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:27,338
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you see any steps being taken

138
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,362
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, by the current administration, you know, to resolve some of these issues you just talked about.

139
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:41,364
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything going on that you think is going to resolve these issues?

140
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:43,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's possible to resolve?

141
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:44,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it that way.

142
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:49,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are trying, but, John, if everything was hunky-dory, I wouldn't be running.

143
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:50,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

144
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:52,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be honest with you.

145
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:00,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the administration needs to really consider doing an audit of the city finances.

146
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:07,785
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking $5 million that's missing from the school committee budget and then found and $34 million.

147
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,127
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making Enron and Arthur Anderson look good here.

148
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,047
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nothing to laugh about.

149
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:17,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Good answer, yeah, I hear ya, I hear ya.

150
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that in terms of the sense of community, there's a lot of red tape.

151
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:24,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna tell you a story real quick.

152
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:26,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I told you I got little guys.

153
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:28,838
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite parks I like to go to is Logan Park.

154
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:35,063
[SPEAKER_02]: There, there's a little fire truck, like playground thing for kids to go play, little kids to play on.

155
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:35,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

156
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:43,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had my son with me and I noticed the wooden boards were, they were in rough shape and I didn't want my kid to get splinters or any other kid.

157
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

158
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,391
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called the mayor's office, wrote an email, said, Hey, listen, this is a couple boards.

159
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

160
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:50,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing to go fix it.

161
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:55,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to just go start ripping up, you know, pressure treated wood and putting bolts in.

162
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:57,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have the cops down.

163
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:58,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

164
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, Hey, can I get some top cover and just let them know what I'm willing to do?

165
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is on my own nickel, my own time.

166
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:08,257
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sawing a couple boards and installing a couple carriage bolts and nuts.

167
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:09,317
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't rocket science.

168
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:10,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an engineer.

169
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:11,358
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not rocket science.

170
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:11,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you.

171
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:19,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It became a whole production and I talked with, you know, she put me in touch with some of the parks folks and nothing.

172
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:21,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a couple months later it got fixed.

173
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:25,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And meanwhile, I've got to watch my kid like a hawk and I'm working like for everybody.

174
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was initially something that was donated to the city by a resident.

175
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:35,039
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like the city wound up purchasing it or something originally either.

176
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are people willing to do

177
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:42,070
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, help out the community and not necessarily for any money.

178
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's volunteerism and that's a good thing.

179
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:44,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

180
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:44,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

181
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:51,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we had a better sense of community and maybe we find a way to eliminate some of the red tape, you'll find people who are willing to pitch in.

182
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:52,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with you.

183
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:54,324
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a good point.

184
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:58,287
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what we would call a small issue.

185
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:03,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Important, nonetheless, but that's a good point because it's the little things.

186
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:09,113
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a lot of people in this city that will do the little things.

187
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:10,693
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.

188
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:14,935
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I appreciate that.

189
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:16,576
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.

190
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:18,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Small stuff matters.

191
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:29,453
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of talk, you mentioned real quick the zoning in Medford, and there's so much going on right now with the zoning.

192
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:41,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And meetings and people, it's on Zoom, and a lot of people, I gotta be honest, they don't know too much about all the zoning, what's going on.

193
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:45,326
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your position on zoning?

194
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,268
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming to Medford, I mean, they're doing things.

195
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:49,449
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your position on it?

196
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a position?

197
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:56,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that zoning is a huge concern overall, and I know there's a lot of chatter about it.

198
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:02,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my personal view is it's something we should look at, but it's like everything else, right?

199
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:10,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremes are not necessarily good in general, in any system, in any government, in any operation.

200
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:17,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So that said, I think right now what we're seeing is essentially it could be mass gentrification.

201
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,082
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of rezoning happening all at once.

202
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:21,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you an example again.

203
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,925
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a talk of we need more affordable housing.

204
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask the question, what is affordable to you?

205
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:31,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two kids in daycare.

206
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:31,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a mortgage.

207
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:39,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the other expenses that go along with that.

208
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:46,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still somehow afford it, but we've had to make choices along the way.

209
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:56,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So more supply in the city of Medford, I don't think is gonna move the needle at all in terms of the cost of rent, the cost of mortgage.

210
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go increase the supply.

211
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:04,403
[SPEAKER_02]: And I heard from a city councilor that said, well, I'm not going to go explain the details of supply and demand.

212
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:05,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.

213
00:14:06,164 --> 00:14:07,925
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is like attacking a tank with a toothpick.

214
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:12,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there are greater economic forces at play than anything the city of Medford can influence.

215
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So why are we addressing the zoning to begin with?

216
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it for the needs of the residents?

217
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:20,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the benefit for the current residents of the city?

218
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,808
[SPEAKER_02]: So, my concern with the zoning really is more about the commercial and the industrial side.

219
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:26,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

220
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:31,850
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't know this, but commercial and industrial pay twice the amount the residents do.

221
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:37,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And for every commercial business or industrial zone you lose, who picks up the tab?

222
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:39,473
[SPEAKER_02]: The other commercial businesses.

223
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:40,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

224
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:40,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

225
00:14:41,354 --> 00:14:42,074
[SPEAKER_00]: And the residents.

226
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:42,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

227
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're talking taxes.

228
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:45,475
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're basically talking.

229
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:46,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

230
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:51,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking taxes, but also wear and tear on your services.

231
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:54,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Your fire, your police, your EMS, your roads, your schools.

232
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,159
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

233
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,141
[SPEAKER_02]: All that has to be taken into consideration.

234
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:00,403
[SPEAKER_02]: My house is a single family house.

235
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:01,964
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I came to Medford.

236
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted a single family home, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

237
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:07,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are meant for condos, and I'm not one of them.

238
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:07,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

239
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:08,369
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

240
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:10,090
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of what attracted us to Medford.

241
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:19,458
[SPEAKER_02]: We know how that right now my house under the new plan will be zoned for three family So they will tear my house down.

242
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:20,739
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll buy it from me for whatever.

243
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:28,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we're 750 today Yeah, someone else could buy it for 750 000 and have their family And and and use a starter house.

244
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:32,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah instead Contractor's gonna come

245
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:38,784
[SPEAKER_02]: buy it, tear it down, turn it into a triplex, and sell each unit for a million dollars.

246
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's that affordable for?

247
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:44,651
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.

248
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:46,554
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been about choice.

249
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:59,090
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my opinion, it would be nice to see some affordable housing in the city, but there's a limit.

250
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:00,751
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how you go about it.

251
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I agree with most of what you're saying.

252
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:06,093
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making some good points here.

253
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:10,894
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're making some very good points.

254
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:14,536
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay, let's move from that.

255
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:18,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get on to, it's no secret.

256
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:26,360
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned it, economic growth in Metfin, best described as stagnant.

257
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,481
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think everyone's aware of that.

258
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,603
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no secret.

259
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:36,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as spending and taxes go, do you have priorities?

260
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:37,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a plan?

261
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:42,632
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what would you, you get elected to the city council, what are you looking to do?

262
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the question isn't how do we get economic growth.

263
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,912
[SPEAKER_02]: The city is not a publicly traded Wall Street company.

264
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:52,594
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the metric?

265
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:54,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've asked that publicly before.

266
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:58,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not revenue dollars coming in and every year you want more revenue.

267
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:03,685
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no earnings ratio on the city.

268
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:07,489
[SPEAKER_02]: The metric in this case should be sustainment.

269
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:09,484
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we should be looking at.

270
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:13,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have industry leaving, that's a problem.

271
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,330
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to fix that.

272
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,912
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not growth, it's just keeping what we have at a minimum.

273
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to work that.

274
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:23,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Example, August Bush, down on Riverside Ave.

275
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:28,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the overrides came in, right, they probably read the tea leaves and they had a choice to make.

276
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:31,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they operate out of Quincy or do they operate out of Medford?

277
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:33,271
[SPEAKER_02]: They chose Quincy.

278
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:34,191
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

279
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:37,752
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, the latest I heard, you tell me if you've heard any different.

280
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:41,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Market Basket was maybe considering it, but so was the MBTA.

281
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And the MBTA is the lead bidder.

282
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:45,855
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the highest bidder last I heard.

283
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:46,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

284
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:51,176
[SPEAKER_02]: That's over 20 acres, and it's like 24 acres of property, commercial property.

285
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:52,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah.

286
00:17:52,597 --> 00:18:00,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the MBTA winds up actually purchasing that property, that's 24 acres worth of commercial tax revenue gone.

287
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:06,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the MBTA, they'll pay the permits and fees to build their structures, but then they don't owe a dime for taxes afterwards.

288
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:12,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So that burden is going to shift to the remaining commercial industrial.

289
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And this just begins quicksand.

290
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:16,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a spiral.

291
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:27,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, and there's plenty of vacant commercial buildings, it's not just in Medford, I've seen it actually in Malden too, near where the Aviva Trattoria is, near Exchange Street in Malden.

292
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Big sign, 300,000 square feet available.

293
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:35,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Across the street from my house, 400 Riverside Ave, 100,000 square feet available.

294
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen those signs too, yep, yep.

295
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:43,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we really should be focusing on and talking with them, how do we get these buildings filled?

296
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:45,992
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the local area,

297
00:18:46,852 --> 00:18:48,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Wooburn.

298
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:51,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Wooburn's got a lot of industry.

299
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:58,337
[SPEAKER_02]: When people want to go build buildings here, they go to Wooburn to go get their heavy equipment, to get their building materials.

300
00:18:58,797 --> 00:18:59,738
[SPEAKER_02]: They buy steel there.

301
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:05,060
[SPEAKER_02]: These aren't things that necessarily negatively impact the surrounding community.

302
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,340
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they've done a really good job.

303
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:07,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Malden.

304
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:11,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Malden's got the Panadosi Bakery.

305
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:12,503
[SPEAKER_02]: They make bread.

306
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:14,084
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the New England Coffee.

307
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:14,984
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot.

308
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:16,305
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got National Grid.

309
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:18,869
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we making, Medford?

310
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:20,630
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I hear ya.

311
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Sausage.

312
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I hear ya.

313
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Bianco sausage, don't get me wrong.

314
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:24,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too, me too.

315
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:25,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Great product.

316
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:26,954
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what we're making now, is sausage.

317
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:28,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Good plugin for Bianco's.

318
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, if you've never been to Bianco's, go.

319
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:32,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.

320
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:33,578
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the chicken sausage.

321
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:34,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.

322
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:39,161
[SPEAKER_02]: We have vocational schools, we're one of the few in the area, we should be promoting that.

323
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:43,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Unit Man's the nearest one, that's up in Lexington, and a lot of people don't wanna drive that far.

324
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And we gotta use the river,

325
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,411
[SPEAKER_02]: We're unique.

326
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:55,458
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a river, we've got interstate access, we've got major routes and highways, and we've got the T. We should be capitalizing on that and fostering it.

327
00:19:56,258 --> 00:20:08,529
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that river's going to, if it's even up the square, and I'm not, but if things get done right, and if people really look into it, that could be a big revenue driver.

328
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:14,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that brings people from out of the city into the city to spend money and support the local economy.

329
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:14,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

330
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I hear you.

331
00:20:19,497 --> 00:20:22,059
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more commercial, industrial.

332
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,281
[SPEAKER_00]: Spending and taxes.

333
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:28,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Spending and taxes.

334
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:34,386
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go on for weeks, but we're not going to, but we could.

335
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,448
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people

336
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:42,136
[SPEAKER_00]: talk, you know, there's all different sides to this story.

337
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:52,587
[SPEAKER_00]: The two basic sides are, you know, control your spending, you know, let's really take a look at what you have and, you know,

338
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:56,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it looks like they're just looking for more taxes, taxes.

339
00:20:56,948 --> 00:21:05,092
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the bottom line is, as far as spending and taxes, what do you think?

340
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,712
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you have any priorities?

341
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:09,033
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that Barlow X?

342
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:17,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the fact that we passed two overrides, and don't take my word for it, look at the video.

343
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:20,658
[SPEAKER_02]: You had the city council president and you had the mayor dancing.

344
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:30,291
[SPEAKER_02]: at the thought, not the thought, but at the fact that people now are only paying only $400 more a year in their taxes.

345
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:31,651
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that working out?

346
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:35,031
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my thought.

347
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:37,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, spending is necessary.

348
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:43,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes tax increases are necessary, but nobody should ever be happy about it, and certainly nobody should ever be excited.

349
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:48,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was the wrong attitude to have on that, and that was a little unprofessional.

350
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:52,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So that said, also, we've got a lot of lawsuits happening in the city.

351
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:53,998
[SPEAKER_02]: That needs to stop.

352
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:55,519
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not doing anybody any favors.

353
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:57,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a waste of taxpayer money.

354
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's other little gems, which I get it.

355
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:01,803
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to pay people.

356
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,263
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have nice things.

357
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:10,028
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you go back to the well, now you've got to start really taking a hard look and understanding what are my needs versus my wants.

358
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:12,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I deal with this with my kids.

359
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,871
[SPEAKER_02]: We all do.

360
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:18,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I see that we're paying two grand a year for a poet laureate.

361
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:19,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

362
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:24,338
[SPEAKER_02]: But you asked for 500,000 for roads and streets.

363
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:24,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

364
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to wonder what else is going on.

365
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:35,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, when you start seeing millions that are going missing and people refuse to do an audit, again, this is making Enron look good folks.

366
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:36,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

367
00:22:36,528 --> 00:22:36,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

368
00:22:37,248 --> 00:22:37,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

369
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:38,049
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.

370
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,700
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.

371
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:40,900
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

372
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,922
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, let's get on to something else now.

373
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,922
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not attend school here.

374
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:51,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I guess you've lived here for around 10 years, you said.

375
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:56,145
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Medford has rich history.

376
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I love history.

377
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:00,266
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me personally.

378
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:01,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a big history fan.

379
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:05,087
[SPEAKER_00]: But, so you've only been here for 10 years.

380
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:07,308
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the history in Medford

381
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what do you know about the history of method?

382
00:23:12,612 --> 00:23:13,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it that way.

383
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,078
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few things in Medford, right?

384
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:18,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're correct.

385
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:24,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally, the things you would learn in school, I didn't have that opportunity, because I know about the things instead in Western Mass.

386
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:25,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

387
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:40,963
[SPEAKER_02]: In my school, we learned about General Knox, and he went and captured a whole bunch of cannons from Fort Ticonderoga and brought a little caravan through the state of Massachusetts, including my hometown, what's now Route 20, and parked them on Dorchester Heights and liberated Boston.

388
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:44,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the things that brought my hometown to fame.

389
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:45,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford built clipper ships.

390
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:47,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford had brickyards.

391
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:57,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Revere rode through on the way to go warn about the British trying to interfere with some patriots over in Lexington and Concord.

392
00:23:58,968 --> 00:23:59,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there's some rum.

393
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:01,644
[SPEAKER_02]: that Medford is known for.

394
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:02,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Medford made some good rum, yeah.

395
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:03,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had it.

396
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:05,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard the recipe's still around, but I've never had it.

397
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:09,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I heard someone's bringing it back, so that'll be interesting, yeah.

398
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:14,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the ways I learned some of the history is from the Mystic River Bend Park.

399
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:19,399
[SPEAKER_02]: It's down behind the McGlynn schools and around the corner from where I live.

400
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went and I took some pictures yesterday.

401
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:26,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out in the rain because I wanted to make sure my information was accurate.

402
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:30,668
[SPEAKER_02]: The signs look about the same rough shape that they did when I first saw them.

403
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:31,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

404
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:36,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sad because, I mean, we have community preservation funding.

405
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:39,272
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, this is literally preserving your community.

406
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the name, Community Preservation Act.

407
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:41,433
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

408
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those signs are unfortunately in such disrepair.

409
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,375
[SPEAKER_02]: There's graffiti on them.

410
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:45,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

411
00:24:45,835 --> 00:24:53,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of great info that talk about the river, how it used to be salt marshes and where throughout the years where it changed the ecology.

412
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

413
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's graffiti on them and they're barely readable.

414
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,980
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them looks like it was melted in the sun or something.

415
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:00,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

416
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shame.

417
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

418
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we really should be taking care of our city better.

419
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:04,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

420
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:07,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And little things like that go a long way.

421
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:09,842
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's probably been like that for almost 10 years.

422
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:10,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

423
00:25:10,362 --> 00:25:18,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, you're looking at some, I like looking at the little things, a lot of big things, but you know, it's nice that you're looking at some of the little things too that matter.

424
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:21,364
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little, but they matter.

425
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:22,144
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you show

426
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,991
[SPEAKER_02]: that you care about your city, maybe you won't get trashed as easily.

427
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:27,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

428
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:29,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, yeah, I hear you.

429
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:29,833
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.

430
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:30,713
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.

431
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some great answers.

432
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:35,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, all right.

433
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:40,717
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just gonna basically, you know, these are more like personal questions, silly questions.

434
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:45,919
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you want to call them, but, um, you know, we're going to have some other candidates on.

435
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,679
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just find out little things.

436
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:49,060
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh,

437
00:25:50,563 --> 00:25:57,990
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say are the least and your most favorite things for you to do in Method?

438
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:03,295
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, there's got to be things you love to do and maybe some things you don't like to do.

439
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:03,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

440
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:05,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a shot.

441
00:26:05,457 --> 00:26:06,037
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?

442
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:06,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

443
00:26:09,305 --> 00:26:16,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a father with young kids, so I don't get to go out as much as I want, as much as I used to.

444
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:19,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, my fun things now involve them.

445
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:24,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say, fresh donuts over at Donuts with a Difference.

446
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:25,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's unique.

447
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:26,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Good choice.

448
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:32,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, I grew up when Dunkin' Donuts used to make all the donuts in every store, and the old man was there, time to make the donuts.

449
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:37,071
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a unique thing that we have, and I love their donuts.

450
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:37,891
[SPEAKER_02]: They're awesome.

451
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:39,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I bring them to work with me when I can.

452
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:40,173
[SPEAKER_02]: People love them.

453
00:26:42,574 --> 00:26:46,936
[SPEAKER_02]: The various parks in the city, I'm involved using those.

454
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:49,398
[SPEAKER_02]: They're great.

455
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:51,359
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what I spend a lot of my time doing.

456
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:52,860
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as things I don't like,

457
00:26:54,448 --> 00:27:00,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd be remiss if I said, you know, going to city council meetings, but I'll be honest with you, staying up until 12 o'clock at night, going to city council meetings.

458
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:01,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

459
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:02,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't love that.

460
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:04,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone loves it.

461
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:04,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

462
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:04,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

463
00:27:05,617 --> 00:27:15,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, driving down my street, I don't know what am I driving down roads in the city of Medford or am I in a, you know, looking at Germany, occupied France and world war II.

464
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:17,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure.

465
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:18,154
[SPEAKER_00]: A few potholes, huh?

466
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:19,114
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple potholes.

467
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:20,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure what happened here.

468
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:21,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.

469
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:23,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I like a little bit of history.

470
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:24,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.

471
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,777
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's, you know, good answer, good answer.

472
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:35,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I remember, you know, I had two children, and I remember back when they were young, he did a lot of, you know, everything is for the kids.

473
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,560
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the way it should be.

474
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,601
[SPEAKER_00]: And CB Scoops.

475
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:38,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, CB Scoops.

476
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:40,101
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things we love.

477
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:41,002
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids love it.

478
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:41,602
[SPEAKER_00]: We go there.

479
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:42,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

480
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:43,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, it's great.

481
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:43,463
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.

482
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,824
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dealing with the kids.

483
00:27:46,864 --> 00:27:48,124
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at that level.

484
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:48,584
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

485
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:49,385
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you.

486
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:50,125
[SPEAKER_02]: We eat the ice cream.

487
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:51,245
[SPEAKER_02]: We watch the train go by.

488
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:52,166
[SPEAKER_02]: My kid loves trains.

489
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:53,326
[SPEAKER_02]: We literally get to see the train.

490
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:54,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll sit there and just watch the bell.

491
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:56,047
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss those days.

492
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,248
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bringing back good memories for me.

493
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,591
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting down on time here.

494
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,312
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do want to ask you.

495
00:28:11,852 --> 00:28:12,833
[SPEAKER_00]: I always ask this.

496
00:28:15,097 --> 00:28:26,167
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, growing up in Method my whole life, if I wanted to go find someone, I always, you know, depending on who it was, I knew where I could go find them, put it that way.

497
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:38,016
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to find you, if I wanted to get in touch with you, Mr. Merritt, where in Metford would someone look for you?

498
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:41,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone wanted to meet you, introduce you, whatever, where would they meet you?

499
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would be a good place to look?

500
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you're busy, you've got kids, but...

501
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:52,618
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a hot topic going on, you might find me at the podium at a city council meeting on a Wednesday night.

502
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:54,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you here plenty of times.

503
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:58,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I've attended quite a few of those.

504
00:28:58,886 --> 00:28:59,266
[SPEAKER_00]: You are.

505
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:00,227
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always there.

506
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:06,054
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things, one of the many things I do like about you is

507
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:07,516
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions.

508
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:10,301
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always given solutions.

509
00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:12,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, to me, that's nice.

510
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:18,794
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice thing to hear someone, you know, no screaming, no stomping your feet, but

511
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:24,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Serious subjects, a lot of serious stuff going on, but I like it.

512
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:28,808
[SPEAKER_00]: You're offering solutions and that's, you know, that's really important.

513
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,090
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's about it.

514
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:35,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the show's come to an end.

515
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:37,974
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure having you, it really was.

516
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:38,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

517
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:41,677
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do have an email address that people can reach me at.

518
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yep, give us the email.

519
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:46,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It's meritformedford at gmail.com.

520
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

521
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So, two R's, two T's.

522
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:51,543
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's F-O-R, not the number four, but that's all right.

523
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got a website that I'm working on, but it's not up yet.

524
00:29:54,804 --> 00:29:58,766
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have an apparatus working my campaign.

525
00:29:58,806 --> 00:30:00,967
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a grassroots, you know, thing, so.

526
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:02,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it is, yeah, yeah.

527
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:06,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes some time, takes a lot of work, and you're a very busy guy.

528
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,130
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll get that up and running.

529
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the meantime, the email's good, or come for me at a city council meeting.

530
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:12,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, John.

531
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:13,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.

532
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:14,370
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you, too.

533
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,752
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have you back again.

534
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:19,936
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're all set with your other accounts, we'll announce them.

535
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:22,279
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have you back, I can tell.

536
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,481
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.

537
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:27,104
