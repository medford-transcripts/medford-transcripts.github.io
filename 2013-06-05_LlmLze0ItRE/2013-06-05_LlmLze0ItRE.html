    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1.701s">You</a>  on? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=5.902s">The</a>  19th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=8.423s">The</a>  clerk will call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=10.043s">Councilor</a>  Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=10.824s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=11.984s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=13.364s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=14.344s">Vice</a>  President De La Rosa? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=15.265s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=15.565s">Councilor</a>  McCray? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=16.985s">Councilor</a>  Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=19.106s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=23.562s">President</a>  Mayorkas.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=24.183s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=24.703s">Six</a>  members present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=25.924s">Kindly</a>  please rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=28.005s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=40.493s">On</a>  page one, motions, orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=42.335s">2013-500,</a>  offered by Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=46.437s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Department of Public Work repaint the crosswalks at Method Street and Albion Street in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=53.541s">Mr.</a>  Del Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=54.682s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=56.302s">As</a>  the weather gets nicer, the DPW is embarking upon the repainting of the crosswalks, specifically Medford Street and Albion Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=64.746s">Very</a>  busy intersection, and a lot of the children in the South Medford neighborhood use that to get to the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=70.549s">So</a>  if they can get that on the top of the list when they're out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=75.591s">Vice</a>  President Del Russo.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=77.672s">I</a>  agree with that 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=82.341s">uh,</a>  chiming in here is because Medford street was mentioned, uh, which seems to be more of a gravel path these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=90.924s">And</a>  I'm wondering if, uh, if the council wouldn't mind me amending this to include that the DPW commissioner, uh, uh, examine ways that we can perhaps resurface Medford street on the motion of council.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=109.709s">So</a>  it's amended by vice president Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=113.194s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Penta?</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=114.915s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Dello Russo's amendment, we just got a notice I think today relative to a meeting that's going to take place on June 3rd by the folks that are doing the work over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=125.444s">So</a>  that may be something you may want to bring up for the purpose of letting them pay to do the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=132.649s">So</a>  it's in your, pardon me? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=134.09s">You</a>  want to amend that further? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=134.891s">Yeah,</a>  amend it further, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=137.383s">Why</a>  don't you repeat that again? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=138.705s">The</a>  amendment is that the Department of Transportation is having a public meeting on June 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=142.97s">I</a>  believe it's in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=144.432s">We</a>  got a notice today in our emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=146.474s">There's</a>  one of six locations, that's the next one coming up, and that will make reference to Councilor Camuso's and Councilor De La Rosa's thoughts relative to Medford Street.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=158.281s">It's</a>  completely germane to the Green Line project and would greatly enhance quality of life visitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=165.767s">Even</a>  if you look at the quality of some of the sidewalks in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=172.121s">I</a>  don't like to be critical, but I mean, a lot of them are just lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=176.503s">And</a>  it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=178.865s">We</a>  also, I'm sure we all received the same email this weekend that I know a group of neighbors up there had done really tremendous work in addressing some sanitation and rodent issues up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=194.573s">And</a>  we've seen additional infractions happening on the other side of the border. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=201.681s">you</a>  know, this is an area that a neighborhood that needs attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=206.905s">And</a>  I know a lot of the side streets up there have gotten some over the past couple of years as far as resurfacing, resurfacing, new pipes, sidewalks, and I'd love to see that continue.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=219.213s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Camuso, as amended by Vice President Dello Russo and Councilor Penta, speak on this.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=224.516s">Nominate</a>  just for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=226.278s">John</a>  Sorrell of Metcalfe Street Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=228.937s">I</a>  want to commend Councilor Camuso for bringing this to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=233.839s">And,</a>  uh, but what I wonder is why he singles out this particular crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=239.282s">There</a>  are many other crosswalks that need to be taken care of.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=244.584s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=244.965s">And</a>  that's a wonderful question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=246.525s">Um,</a>  but when citizens of Medford that walk that area every day, reach out to any of their elected officials in the community, it's our job to respond in a favorable manner to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=256.983s">So</a>  as long as people continue to call me regarding city issues, I'm going to keep bringing them up, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=262.628s">And</a>  we don't pick and choose issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=264.27s">As</a>  I stated in my brief speech, as they're embarking on painting all the crosswalks, but this is one is particular public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=272.813s">where</a>  all the kids that are on the other side of Medford Street have to cross a main street to go to an elementary school, the Columbus School.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=279.639s">Yeah,</a>  if I may, they are all dependent upon public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=284.022s">And</a>  if you walk a little further from Albion Street and Medford Street, you go on to Medford and Martin Avenue, that crosswalk needs to be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=295.532s">Then</a>  you go down another few blocks, right across from the Tufts Pool, kids are crossing that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=302.591s">You</a>  can't see those painted marks.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=305.093s">Can</a>  the record reflect these ones as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=308.096s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=309.578s">In</a>  front of the pool and also on Medford Street.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=312.62s">In</a>  front of the pool, yeah, that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=314.062s">When</a>  does the pool open, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=317.825s">First</a>  week in July.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=318.946s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=319.767s">So</a>  there's some time.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=321.449s">Yes,</a>  point of information, Vice President de la Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=323.431s">I</a>  didn't mean to interrupt either one of you, but, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=326.502s">I</a>  do have to point out that even though, and I agree the crosswalks are faded and in need of attention, but you know, throughout the summer season, the staff at the Tufts pool does a wonderful job at putting up barriers and cones and really bringing attention and focus on the pedestrian traffic in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=348.554s">So</a>  this can only help their efforts.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=351.86s">Yes,</a>  it will. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=352.681s">That's</a>  true. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=353.962s">Then</a>  you go on to Alexander Avenue and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=357.045s">This</a>  is only three blocks down. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=358.926s">We're</a>  going north now on Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=361.869s">That</a>  is very, very bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=363.911s">That</a>  needs to be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=365.172s">Now</a>  you go four more blocks, you go to Bowdoin Street and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=369.716s">That</a>  crosswalk needs attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=371.057s">It's</a>  just a road, the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=372.856s">is</a>  going to the whole city.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=373.837s">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=374.817s">And</a>  that's why we have a DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=376.598s">No,</a>  they are.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=377.299s">They</a>  are now in the process of repainting.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=379.72s">You</a>  can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=380.32s">This,</a>  this should be, this comes down.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=383.522s">Mr.</a>  President information. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=384.663s">Council</a>  marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=386.104s">Mr.</a>  President, uh, you know, year after year after year, we speak about this time of the year about repainting our crosswalks, which is a major public safety issue in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=397.702s">year</a>  after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=399.022s">Some</a>  years, it takes several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=401.423s">Some</a>  years, it takes just a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=404.724s">You</a>  know, Mr. President, it would only make sense from a standpoint of public safety in our community to install thermoplastic crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=415.066s">Painted</a>  crosswalks last one year, if that, and then you're back again painting them immediately if you get to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=423.442s">Thermoplastic</a>  crosswalks, their life expectancy is three to five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=429.887s">They're</a>  highly reflective, much better than paint, so you can see them from a distance when you're driving, and you can see if someone's in the crosswalk from a distance, and they're slip resistant also. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=440.977s">We</a>  wouldn't have to discuss these issues every single year, when are we gonna get out and paint? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=447.042s">We</a>  gotta get our whole crew at DPW out to paint the crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=451.271s">Wouldn't</a>  it be more efficient, not only for public safety reasons, but more efficiency to have a crosswalk painted once every five years rather than five times? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=461.798s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=464.18s">It</a>  really doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=466.281s">Thermoplastic</a>  crosswalks are a little more expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=470.08s">But</a>  you know what, the state uses them on the highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=472.601s">They</a>  use them for a reason, because studies have been done to say this is a far better way of marking intersections and crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=480.403s">And</a>  if we're really all interested about truly public safety concerns, we would all be pushing for thermoplastic crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=488.765s">And</a>  we wouldn't have to talk for another five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=491.966s">But</a>  year after year after year, it gets brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=494.868s">We</a>  hope the city gets out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=496.41s">And</a>  then we find out there's 40 in this area that weren't done, another 40 in this area, another 40 in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=503.335s">And</a>  then we do a piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=504.856s">And</a>  by the time we're done with them, the snow starts to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=508.439s">That's</a>  what happens every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=510.321s">I</a>  don't know what it's going to take to get a handle on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=513.624s">It's</a>  no secret, Mr. President, thermoplastic has been in existence for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=518.905s">Federal,</a>  state highways, they all use thermoplastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=522.627s">Painting</a>  is a thing of the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=525.909s">It's</a>  almost as bad as marking your streets that need to be swept with paper pamphlets. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=531.973s">It's</a>  almost as archaic as marking your streets with paper pamphlets when you have to do street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=538.342s">So</a>  I don't know, Mr. President, maybe we should be putting a resolution together as a council saying, you know what, Mr. Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=544.988s">We</a>  want to see, if it's too late this year, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=548.771s">The</a>  budget's coming up very shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=551.153s">We're</a>  going to start discussion budget in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=555.076s">We</a>  should be pushing for thermoplastic crosswalks if there's a cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=560.461s">associated</a>  with you, I know there's a cost associated with it, that should be in the budget and then we won't have to discuss public safety issues year after year and we can focus our time on issues of importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=571.736s">Well,</a>  safety is important, but when you have your crosswalks painted, then you can look, with thermoplastic, then you can look at other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=578.198s">You</a>  don't have to keep on refocusing your attention on the same issue year after year after year, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=584.521s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=585.181s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=587.422s">All</a>  right, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=588.282s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=589.102s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=590.843s">Another</a>  one that I got over the weekend was for Dartmouth and Yale. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=594.864s">I</a>  sent it under suspension, but it's not in our packet to the clerk, so if we could just add it to this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=599.266s">It</a>  can be amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=602.13s">crosswalk.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=603.49s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=604.731s">Councilor</a>  Karygiannopoulos. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=605.652s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=606.892s">I</a>  would support Councilor Marks' resolution in doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=609.334s">We</a>  don't have to do them all in one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=611.595s">Every</a>  year, you do a certain percentage of them, and eventually they'll be all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=617.138s">If</a>  Councilor Marks would make that resolution, I would be more than happy to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=630.968s">And</a>  the long run, it'll be a cost saving, not a cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=633.489s">Spend</a>  a little, save a lot.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=635.229s">Mr.</a>  Sorello, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=640.85s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may add to that list, one of the major intersections in this city is where Mystic Avenue meets Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=648.951s">Now,</a>  that crosswalk is faded. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=650.452s">That's</a>  right across from the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=652.652s">Major</a>  traffic there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=653.672s">And</a>  that's considered one of the most hazardous intersections in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=657.955s">That</a>  has to be dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=659.396s">But</a>  all of this points up to one of the major failings of this administration, and that is lack of maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=665.959s">This</a>  is where most of our problems come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=668.74s">I</a>  don't know why the administration doesn't recognize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=672.222s">The</a>  administration is willing to spend millions of dollars on buildings such as garages and new pools, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=680.086s">All</a>  of these could have been avoided with proper maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=683.607s">Now,</a>  we visited the pool today up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=687.682s">I</a>  was surprised.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=688.783s">We're</a>  going to talk about that with the committee.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=690.504s">I'm</a>  not talking about, about the pool itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=692.385s">I'm</a>  talking about maintenance and disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=694.847s">Now</a>  you were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=697.088s">I</a>  think I was, that area was not maintained at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=700.13s">It</a>  looked like a dump. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=701.411s">There's</a>  no need for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=702.772s">All</a>  you got to do is throw a crew and they clean it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=705.954s">That</a>  ought to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=708.356s">I</a>  wish it would be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=709.656s">It</a>  would save the taxpayers a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=712.078s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=729.367s">I</a>  just want to, my point of view is I think the city is doing a good thing with the push of this council and Council Marks putting in the thermoplastic sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=738.829s">I</a>  know we're doing a pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=740.089s">We</a>  are doing a pilot program for three crosswalks in the city that should be done within the next <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=745.785s">I</a>  think it was four or five months. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=747.805s">So</a>  I think we are moving in a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=750.786s">If</a>  that works, I do agree that we should do many more throughout our community at a rate that we can afford, whether it's five or six per year, however much it costs, that we are able just to afford being able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=764.529s">But</a>  I think it is a way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=766.129s">I</a>  mean, the paint, I agree, lasts not even a full season. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=770.811s">And</a>  we makes it through to the beginning of fall and it's just not effective for the rest of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=776.934s">So</a>  that is a way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=777.955s">I</a>  just want to make sure that we see how the pilot program goes and do it in stages so that we can afford it.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=788.84s">I</a>  just want to mention what my colleague mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=791.441s">The</a>  pilot program is for raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=794.543s">I'm</a>  mentioning about thermoplastic crosswalk, which is very different than a raised crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=799.106s">Although</a>  I support both initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=801.127s">Just</a>  want to set the record straight on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=804.049s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=865.29s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=866.61s">Further?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=868.211s">Councilor</a>  Penta?</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=869.451s">On</a>  that motion, could we get a copy of where the <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=875.071s">Dog</a>  packs and the amount of money was supposed to be coming from October of 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=879.395s">The</a>  mayor made a public announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=883.058s">We've</a>  been talking about dog packs since 2011, because that was supposed to have been part of the mitigation that F.W. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=889.884s">White,</a>  or J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=890.605s">White,</a>  was supposed to be giving the city of Medford for the FAST-14. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=893.847s">So</a>  we've never seen the dog pack. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=896.169s">Could</a>  we just get the handle on what that mitigation terminology was on dog packs? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=901.957s">$50,000.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=902.077s">I</a>  have no idea.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=908.941s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=910.282s">Uh,</a>  at this weekend's memorial, uh, ceremony, I had a resident come up to me and hand me a list of, uh, 13 names of just residents in his area, uh, of people that support a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=923.992s">And,</a>  um, if you look at the list, Mr. President's Lowell court, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=928.258s">Rockwell</a>  Ave, Pool Street, Evans Street, Middlesex Ave, Chipman, Burnside, Lawrence, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=939.172s">Hurlcroft,</a>  Spring Street, Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=942.474s">These</a>  are residents, Mr. President, name and phone number of people that support a dog park just in a small general area off of Central Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=951.34s">A</a>  small area that this gentleman went out and just got a number of signatures of people that support a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=957.123s">You</a>  can take this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=958.644s">and</a>  a hundred fold throughout the community, people are wondering where this dog park is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=963.587s">It</a>  was several weeks ago that I offered a resolution and Mr. Clerk, I don't know if it's been answered or not by the mayor, asking for the status of the dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=972.073s">Where</a>  is the dog park? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=973.374s">I</a>  don't believe we got a response back from the mayor and that was voted on this council, by this council, seven weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=981.355s">I</a>  don't know what's happening, but if the mayor's gonna make statements that he received mitigation and what the mitigation is and so forth, then at the very least, residents should hold him accountable to what was stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=998.258s">If</a>  part of the mitigation for the Bridge Fast 14 project was a dog park, then where is the dog park? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1007.341s">Is</a>  there a location, Mr. Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1009.666s">Who's</a>  working on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1010.647s">Did</a>  you create an advisory committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1012.892s">What's</a>  going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1013.793s">All</a>  we want is a status. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1015.834s">I</a>  know things don't happen overnight, but all we want is a status. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1019.796s">So</a>  for those thousands of pet owners in this community that want a place that their dog can run free, because that's what a dog park is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1027.261s">When</a>  you take your dog to a local park now, they have to be leashed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1031.583s">They</a>  can't run free. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1033.084s">This</a>  would be similar to the dog park that's in Somerville, the dog park that's in Cambridge, and all the surrounding communities that do have currently dog parks right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1042.049s">This</a>  would allow them to exercise and run their dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1046.172s">We're</a>  not asking for anything other than what the mayor said he negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1053.216s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1054.457s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1056.118s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1057.098s">Thank</a>  you again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1058.539s">I'd</a>  like to see the mayor appoint some type of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1060.74s">I</a>  mean, we have a bicycle commission now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1063.682s">I</a>  don't know why we can't have half a dozen residents of the community sit down and maybe propose some spots for these dog parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1072.207s">So</a>  if you could add that onto the amendment.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1076.544s">It's</a>  amended by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1078.346s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1079.347s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1080.669s">And</a>  thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1084.133s">It</a>  is something that we need to have answers to. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1087.137s">I</a>  know that some of the locations that were suggested got a little pushback from some of the neighbors because <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1095.578s">The</a>  dog park is great, but when you look at an area like the Sheepfold, it's very secluded, it's out of the way, people don't have to hear the dogs barking at 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1104.365s">and</a>  the feces on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1107.848s">So,</a>  with that being said, I think there has to be some sort of a committee with neighborhood input from any area that the mayor may be proposing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1118.697s">On</a>  the motion of the Council of Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Penta, Vice President Dello Russo,</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1124.229s">I</a>  just want to commend Councilor Caraviello in suggesting that a committee be appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1129.473s">That's</a>  a wonderful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1130.213s">You</a>  know, I spoke tonight up at the pool when we were examining that and the need to encourage opportunities when the pool is restored for people to participate in that as far as exercising leadership in the maintenance and operation of the pool facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1149.056s">And</a>  again, because those oftentimes bring out the best in people. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1154.463s">And</a>  having enthusiasts for dogs and pets to participate in <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1162.142s">uh,</a>  establishing this, uh, new facility in the city, uh, for, for the dogs and, and for them to have their exercise and ability to, uh, uh, perhaps live, uh, in a more unrestrained way. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1175.046s">I</a>  think it's wonderful opportunity for people to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1177.527s">So</a>  I thank you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1179.608s">And,</a>  uh, I lend my support to this, uh, uh, motion, Mr. President on the motion as amended when a roll call vote on the roll, Mr. Clark.</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1203.649s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1203.829s">I'm</a>  gonna vote a seven affirmative, none of the negative papers approved as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1209.233s">On</a>  page one, 2013 502 offered by Councilor Penta, be resolved that the misleading information at last Tuesday's council meeting that channel three can broadcast from their newly <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1219.87s">rented</a>  location on Riverside Avenue be discussed in the interest and at the expense, uh, and at the expense of cable TV subscribers, uh, council Peta.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1230.836s">Mr.</a>  President last Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1232.357s">Um,</a>  I thought we had a very informative conversation and after I went back and I reviewed the tape, um, I, I, I think to some degree we will mislead or at least I was misled because I asked the question as a related is the new location on Salem street going to have the capacity <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1249.502s">to</a>  do a broadcast from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1251.983s">And</a>  the answer was yes from the manager of the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1257.945s">Now,</a>  subsequent to that, immediately following the meeting, the transmission of the module, or whatever you want to call the terminology, was in the corner of the room over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1267.888s">And</a>  the conversation finally alluded to the fact that on Riverside Avenue, there is absolutely no Comcast, and there is no Verizon capacity to do broadcasting or to bring cable in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1279.687s">Now,</a>  if you remember correctly, Mr. President, it was you who brought up this issue, I think some five to seven years ago, relative to a business client on High Street who was trying to get Comcast, I think, or Verizon, into the building over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1295.113s">It</a>  was Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1296.774s">And</a>  at that point in time, I believe there was, in our conversation, I believe we had someone from Channel 3, and I don't know who, so I don't want to mention any names. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1308.291s">because</a>  I'd be absolutely wrong, but I remember somebody from Channel 3 indicating that that was one of the problems that we had in Medford Square, the inability or the lack of capacity to have broadcasting in the downtown Medford Square area, which seems to be pretty kind of evident. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1320.658s">Now,</a>  again, from the conversation that took place last Tuesday night and from the information that was ascertained, there is a two-year contract signed, I believe, at 32 Salem Street, Riverside Avenue, excuse me, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1333.507s">There's</a>  no Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1334.348s">There's</a>  no Verizon there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1336.109s">So</a>  how do you broadcast out of have a full-fledged studio if you don't have that capacity to broadcast from there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1343.775s">So</a>  what's going on now, if I understand all of this correctly, is the modular transmission, lack of terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1350.441s">I</a>  don't know the proper terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1352.362s">But</a>  it's here in this particular building, or it was brought here in this particular building. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1357.406s">I</a>  don't know if it's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1358.902s">And</a>  the whole idea is that the transmission would come from Verizon or Comcast to City Hall, and then they would somehow bounce it to 32 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1369.727s">And</a>  I'm saying to myself, well, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1371.308s">What</a>  is this all about? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1373.629s">This</a>  is not having a full-fledged studio that's equipped on its own merits at its own location. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1379.251s">Then</a>  I started to think about this thing even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1380.952s">And</a>  I'm saying to myself, we have a concern here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1384.054s">We're</a>  putting channel-free equipment into Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1387.915s">And</a>  by putting Channel 3 equipment into Medford City Hall, are we talking about having a liability issue here? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1393.379s">Are</a>  we talking about the equipment here in City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1395.881s">Are</a>  we talking about the access to City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1398.062s">The</a>  keys and who would have keys to City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1400.184s">Who</a>  would be coming into City Hall if, in fact, something were to go wrong in the transmission from City Hall to 32 Riverside Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1408.009s">And</a>  there's a whole host of questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1409.471s">And</a>  the city has a liability policy as it relates to being a self-insured. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1413.433s">Now,</a>  we all know that Channel 3 is a separate private nonprofit corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1417.611s">So,</a>  I mean, we have two separate entities here running around. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1421.674s">We</a>  were also told at that point in time that there was, I believe, less than $100,000 operating budget that they were operating in, but there is another budget for whatever that might be worth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1434.682s">So</a>  I tried to get down there on two separate occasions on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1437.624s">Both</a>  times I couldn't get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1438.845s">Both</a>  times the door was locked, but on one particular day, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1442.022s">The</a>  paper was down, I did have a chance to look in, and it didn't look like there was hardly any work, if any work at all was taking place down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1447.724s">Now</a>  this goes back to March of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1450.345s">So</a>  now we have a station manager that's getting paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1452.586s">We</a>  have no transmission, no broadcasting coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1455.628s">We</a>  have, for whatever the reason might be, if in fact the city of Medford is now being a part of whatever Channel 3 is going to be involved with, if the mayor is doing this, I have no idea why Channel 3 would even be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1467.031s">and</a>  entertaining City Hall, but more importantly, why would they even want to stay on Riverside Avenue with no access to cable television, Verizon or Comcast? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1477.038s">You</a>  know, poor choice, they've been around, they know the situation, they know what Medford Square is about, they know what Riverside Ave is all about, and that was a poor choice to go there, especially being in the business for, they're not novice, these people that are working there, and they're a part of Channel 3, they've been around for a while, they know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1495.424s">And</a>  since they know what's going on, the sad part about this is they've got themselves locked into a contract for which I would assume, I would hope that they would be able to get out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1503.169s">And</a>  even if they had to get sued, who cares about getting sued? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1506.211s">Look</a>  at the time that you're costing the city, the taxpayers, each of the rate payers, each and every cable bill are paying for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1512.096s">You're</a>  paying for station manager that has no job to do because there's nothing being programmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1516.038s">There's</a>  nothing being taped. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1517.878s">And</a>  then it dawned on me yesterday while we were at the cemetery and we were listening to the speeches being made and watching the people that were there and the observance, where is all this portable equipment? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1528.108s">The</a>  portable equipment that Channel 3 has had through the years from the thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars that subscribers have not only paid, but the city of Medford has transferred over to Channel 3 through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1541.872s">They</a>  could have had people out there with portable cameras doing the portable televising of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1546.456s">And</a>  then, if in fact, and when they do come back on, that they would have a whole host of things to put on, the Memorial Day service, graduations, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1555.763s">You</a>  don't see any of that around. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1557.825s">And</a>  then we were told there's 10 board of directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1559.627s">I</a>  have no idea who the board of directors are, and I would hope they would come forward and let us know who these board of directors are so we could get a handle on what the makeup of the board is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1569.206s">And</a>  then, I believe one of the situations that came up, going back and reviewing Judge Jackson's report, that the city paid over $15,000 on, Melanson and Heath, the city's auditor, on one particular year, going back, I believe it was just before or after Judge Jackson, indicated there was, on a $15,000 account, $5,000 was totally unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1587.324s">No</a>  receipts, no records, totally unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1593.157s">Now</a>  I know I see one of the folks sitting in the audience, I don't know which one it is, but I know he came to the podium one night and he said it was a combination of sloppy bookkeeping, not keeping the records accurate, but we're going to do a better job and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1606.01s">Well,</a>  our resolution last week was to ask for an audit, a complete audit on channel three for the last three years and have that forwarded to the city because the rate payers really have no other alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1617.708s">but</a>  to either go to the mirror. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1618.928s">And</a>  it's obvious that the mirror is either failing to do anything, doesn't want to do anything, afraid to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1624.93s">So</a>  the people's voice, which is at this podium right now, is nothing more than asking, what is really going on over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1632.052s">You</a>  know, why would you want to put a TV station for cable subscribers for public access at a location that has no accessibility to the cable? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1643.836s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1644.636s">Number</a>  two, why wasn't that thought out ahead of time <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1647.216s">to</a>  know that cable access could not go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1649.578s">And</a>  number three, more importantly, you know, they should go out and find another spot and think about what really cable access is here within this community and what it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1658.265s">Because</a>  the taxpayers and the rate payers, as Councilor Caraviello alluded to last Tuesday night, they're getting ripped off each and every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1664.65s">There</a>  should be an accounting for that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1666.211s">There</a>  should be a credit coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1667.952s">And</a>  the City of Medford should not be holding that money available for Channel 3 if they're not broadcasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1672.984s">People</a>  are getting paid for doing no work, because there's no work to be done over there, and there's no broadcasting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1678.367s">So,</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I think we really need to get an answer from our city solicitor as it relates to, is the city of Medford using a public building for the purposes of having transmission out of this building to 32 Riverside Avenue for the purposes of having public access cable television? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1697.556s">And</a>  if that's the case, what is, if any, legal ramifications that might be involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1702.605s">Let's</a>  go back to the other issue, Mr. Clark, who comes into the building, who's going to handle the phone calls, who's going to have a set of keys, who's going to be responsible for the equipment, who's going to be responsible for the city's equipment, who's going to be responsible for what's in this building if somebody from Channel 3 or one of their designees comes into this building for whatever the reasons might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1722.009s">That's</a>  the sad part about not having this all in one place with the ability to be <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1727.66s">accessed</a>  in and out of one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1729.661s">And</a>  to come here in City Hall now, after the fact, having whatever the tenure was in 5 High Street, whatever that lawsuit might be all about, whatever the reason why they left there, it doesn't make any sense that they would go to another place that gives them less opportunity for the purposes of broadcasting on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1747.69s">On</a>  motion to Councilor Penta, Vice President Del Russo.</p>

    <p>[Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1750.091s">Just</a>  a point of information, Mr. President, and maybe Councilor Penta could refresh my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1756.735s">When</a>  was the Judge Jackson report issued? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1767.26s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Penta, through the chair.</p>

    <p>[Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1774.783s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1775.503s">Gene</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1778.125s">And</a>  very similar to the way that the Medford housing is a separate but connected entity, so is TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1786.227s">I</a>  received the Judge Jackson report from our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1791.249s">So</a>  our city solicitor has involvement with TV3 on some level. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1798.111s">And</a>  so I think that there is a coupling and an overlap between Medford, Medford residents and TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1803.553s">So</a>  it is our asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1805.393s">It</a>  is our asset and it should be used hand in glove with the Chevalier Auditorium and with the Condon Shell and all of the rest of the arts community <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1815.223s">And</a>  at best, and I'm glad Mr. Palleri is here in the room, because he's the one that can answer some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1823.987s">At</a>  best, there's mismanagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1826.228s">I'm</a>  not accusing anybody of anything illegal or inappropriate, but at best, this channel is being mismanaged at such an incredible level that if $5,000 was missing from Bank of America, somebody would be paying for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1846.037s">So</a>  there is no station currently working right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1851.363s">We</a>  need that station. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1852.444s">We</a>  need it as a public voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1853.625s">But</a>  $200,000 a year they get, and I want to know where the money is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1860.612s">$200,000</a>  from everyone that pays a Verizon bill or a Comcast bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1865.581s">And</a>  it's called the franchise fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1867.223s">It's</a>  on the back of your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1868.564s">I</a>  thank you very much for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1870.206s">This</a>  is a huge issue in the culture of MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1874.169s">MedFed's</a>  ability to connect for <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1877.841s">videotaping</a>  hockey games, football games, political events, the memorial service that we had yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1886.025s">It</a>  is part of the vibrancy that could be part of MedFed and MedFed's future. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1890.567s">And</a>  why it's not up and running? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1893.529s">If</a>  it's not up and running, it's completely being mismanaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1896.911s">And</a>  not for nothing, but somebody should be replaced or removed, not in any bad way, but just because they're incompetent. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1906.678s">is</a>  incompetent at Channel 3, that's in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1909.819s">And</a>  if the mayor cannot adjust that, if the mayor cannot take care of this problem, then we need to go to the FCC or whatever other authorities have control over TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1922.044s">It</a>  could be the FCC, it could be the tax code because they're a non-profit, whoever it is that's the outside authorities, because the mayor has not taken care of this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1932.569s">With</a>  all due respect, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1934.5s">The</a>  mayor has not taken care of this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1936.121s">It's</a>  been going on for years and years and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1938.603s">And</a>  if you look at all of the past meetings that we've had in city council, and you can go on YouTube and find them and just put in TV3 or Mr. Penter or my name or some other councilor's name, and you will get the YouTubes of the topics being brought up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1957.625s">Let's</a>  have a respectful TV3 channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1960.727s">Let's</a>  fire somebody if that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1962.848s">And</a>  I'm not accusing them of anything illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1964.989s">I</a>  am accusing them of incompetence, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1968.591s">Without</a>  a doubt, somebody has been incompetent in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1971.632s">And</a>  I'll do respect to Mr. Poleri. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1973.974s">But</a>  somebody needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=1976.395s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2051.672s">While</a>  you might be autonomous legally, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2054.366s">You</a>  are taking ratepayers' money for which the mayor of this community overrides your corporation, because he administers Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2062.451s">He's</a>  the executive director, and technically, of your Channel 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2066.413s">But</a>  he's not taking any action for whatever the reason is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2069.615s">So</a>  you feel as though it's your duty to go ahead and take action? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2073.017s">It's</a>  my duty to let the taxpayer, ratepayer know that that Channel 3 is not operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2077.64s">It</a>  should be operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2078.941s">And</a>  there is something wrong, especially when you're bringing equipment into this building <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2082.574s">and</a>  trying to make the modular or the transmission go from here to there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2085.695s">Why</a>  didn't you just go to another place that had access?</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2088.436s">So</a>  what is it that you want? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2090.196s">Do</a>  you want us to be on the air, or do you want us to not be on the air? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2094.697s">I'm</a>  a little confused.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2095.757s">There's</a>  nothing to be confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2096.838s">Don't</a>  play the game tonight, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2098.018s">The</a>  bottom line is you're in a place that you had no right going to because there was no access, and you've taken two months worth of ratepayers' money that they're paying each and every <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2105.993s">You're</a>  paying people at work that have no job to go to.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2108.054s">Let</a>  me give you a little history, Bob.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2136.911s">I</a>  am not going to discuss what the board of directors has decided with you or any Councilor in a forum such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2145.776s">Speaking</a>  of the forum, last week, you in particular, Councilor Penta, <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2152.02s">took</a>  our station manager to task over several different items. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2156.063s">Like</a>  what? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2156.383s">The</a>  board of directors did not appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2159.226s">Well,</a>  who are the board of directors? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2160.887s">He</a>  said there was 10 of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2161.928s">Do</a>  you know the 10 of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2162.849s">Who</a>  said there were 10? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2164.45s">Mr.</a>  Sano, your director.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2285.536s">Councilor</a>  President, when can I go ahead and talk about something else? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2289.598s">Get</a>  my 10 minutes to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2291.494s">about</a>  what happened last night.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2292.695s">Point</a>  of information, I wanna know why you're not broadcasting it on Riverside Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2296.438s">Oh,</a>  I'll get to it.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2297.979s">Answer</a>  it, I don't want a long history, just tell me the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2300.34s">All</a>  right, go ahead, go ahead with your statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2301.901s">What's</a>  your answer?</p>

    <p>[Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2302.942s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2304.283s">History</a>  tells us when we incorporated 1984, and I'll talk fast, because it can be long-winded. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2311.488s">In</a>  86, we actually opened up a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2313.99s">We</a>  hired staff in 85. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2316.111s">By</a>  the time the equipment and everything got up, it was not done overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2320.359s">We</a>  moved out of the high school to Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2323.96s">That</a>  took over a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2326.101s">We</a>  renovated a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2327.361s">We</a>  gutted a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2328.721s">We</a>  purchased well over $250,000 worth of equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2333.823s">We</a>  had to move out of that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2335.743s">We</a>  moved to 5 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2338.684s">We</a>  went ahead and did renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2340.504s">That</a>  took approximately, I'll say, a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2343.305s">Don't</a>  hold me to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2344.466s">Could</a>  have been 14 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2346.026s">Could</a>  have been 11 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2347.706s">So</a>  now we're doing another move. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2350.151s">We</a>  moved to 32 Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2353.792s">So</a>  every time we've moved, every time we've set up the corporation, it has taken months, if not more than a year, to go ahead, do renovations, buy the equipment, outfit.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2367.035s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2368.735s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Powell. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2369.976s">Quick</a>  question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2371.256s">Why</a>  did you move from 5 High Street to 32 Riverside Avenue?</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2374.597s">Because</a>  the board of directors went ahead and approved the move. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2377.318s">We</a>  were having some issues with 5 High Street.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2379.874s">If</a>  you're having issues at 5 High Street.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2381.675s">Did</a>  you know that there was a high water table?</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2384.777s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2385.597s">I</a>  also know that the city's Board of Health went down there too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2388.158s">Yes,</a>  I do know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2389.859s">We</a>  had to move for the safety of our members. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2392.32s">Just</a>  answer a simple question, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2395.482s">32</a>  Riverside Ave does not have Verizon or Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2398.603s">Why</a>  did you go there knowing that?</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2399.624s">It</a>  doesn't right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2400.524s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2401.104s">You</a>  went there knowing it didn't have it.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2403.465s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2403.685s">No,</a>  that's not necessarily true. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2405.686s">You're</a>  making an assumption that we knew it didn't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2410.768s">We</a>  do have internet connectivity down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2412.929s">But</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2413.489s">I'm</a>  not going to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2414.869s">I</a>  will kind of wrap that up a little bit at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2417.95s">So</a>  historically, what we've done is when we've had to move, we have to go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2423.052s">And</a>  it's not just, oh, hey, plug in this VCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2425.893s">Hey,</a>  DVD player. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2427.373s">Oh,</a>  put the camera here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2428.934s">That's</a>  not how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2430.774s">Even</a>  though you have some people, a couple of people in this room that'll tell you, oh, I'd have it up in two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2436.576s">I'd</a>  have it up in a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2437.976s">Well,</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2438.477s">That's</a>  not reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2440.433s">It</a>  doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2442.094s">This</a>  is the fourth time we've either outfitted for the first time or moved and had to build a station from scratch that didn't have a station. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2454.002s">It</a>  doesn't happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2455.863s">We</a>  start broadcasting April 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2459.506s">That</a>  was the last time we had an on-air presence. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2462.468s">We</a>  are now in communications with Comcast, and we have been actually, and Verizon, and the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2471.198s">and</a>  in City Hall.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2473.079s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2475.66s">Why</a>  did you bring your transmitter over here last week and have it stored here? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2478.421s">Because</a>  you were going to transmit here and then from here it's going to bounce back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2481.123s">Why'd</a>  you do that?</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2482.83s">Comcast</a>  has gone ahead and talked to City Hall, the Mayor, the Mayor's office and his representatives and Comcast has a feed here that would be cost effective for us to broadcast out of.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2495.953s">So</a>  you cannot broadcast legitimately on your own at 32 Riverside Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2500.315s">That's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2501.795s">Forget</a>  City Hall.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2502.655s">In</a>  the event that we want to spend thousands of dollars to do it.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2505.557s">You</a>  cannot do it, Frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2507.118s">You</a>  just got through saying there's a feed here, which is going to allow you to broadcast them there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2512.14s">You</a>  cannot go to 32 Riverside Avenue on its own without City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2516.002s">You</a>  need City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2516.722s">That's</a>  the bottom line.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2518.183s">No,</a>  we'd prefer to have City Hall's input and their assistance on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2524.046s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2524.611s">Instead</a>  of paying $15,000 to get a cable drop at 32 Riverside Ave.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2530.495s">So</a>  why don't you just go someplace that had cable accessibility?</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2533.577s">Well,</a>  unfortunately, that's not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2535.138s">Well,</a>  why didn't you? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2536.099s">Why</a>  didn't you look it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2536.799s">You've</a>  been around here long enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2538.12s">You</a>  know the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2538.901s">I'll</a>  be perfectly honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2542.283s">We</a>  thought the whole square was wired up with Comcast and Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2547.906s">We</a>  had never heard that any part of the square <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2552.065s">did</a>  not have cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2553.445s">That's</a>  absolutely not true.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2554.466s">Councilman</a>  Iacocca, so a few years ago, five, six years ago, brought up that issue, and your people were here one night when we had a discussion on how Cable Comcast was being broadcast, and as a matter of fact, it went all the way to Haines Square, and it was a business person. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2568.589s">Remember,</a>  who's the person?</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2569.309s">So</a>  are you saying the whole square isn't wired? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2572.059s">Is</a>  that what you're saying?</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2572.8s">My</a>  belief is Riverside Avenue going up to High Street is not wired. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2576.904s">Was</a>  not wired.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2578.646s">Point</a>  of information for you, 5 High Street actually was wired. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2582.69s">Was</a>  wired. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2583.391s">Was</a>  wired with both Verizon and Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2585.894s">Verizon</a>  came in after. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2586.495s">So</a>  your information is inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2587.896s">No</a>  it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2588.457s">I</a>  said back then.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2590.278s">You</a>  mentioned High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2591.579s">That's</a>  what I said.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2592.599s">That</a>  side of High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2593.579s">It's</a>  the other side of High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2594.799s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2595.48s">Well,</a>  you weren't specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2596.8s">You</a>  said High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2597.92s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2598.34s">Five</a>  High Streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2599.161s">Bottom</a>  line is you're wasting taxpayers' money, ratepayers' money by being in a place, you're not broadcasting, there's nothing going on over there, you're paying a station manager and one other person for nothing.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2608.943s">Another</a>  in LRC, Councilor Penta, there's nothing going on over there.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2612.344s">There</a>  is nothing going on for him.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2613.565s">There's</a>  nothing going on over there.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2614.565s">There</a>  isn't.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2615.385s">We</a>  are in the middle of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2617.606s">Our</a>  walls are pretty much up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2619.387s">We're</a>  waiting for the electrician. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2621.048s">We're</a>  getting some wiring done so that we can wire up cameras, outfit our control room and et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2626.952s">We</a>  have our equipment down in the basement.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2629.393s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President, have you got any legal opinion from a city solicitor as it relates to the liability, if anything, and how this is all going to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2637.958s">Have</a>  you discussed this with the city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2639.919s">I</a>  have a meeting tomorrow with the mayor and the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2642.701s">So</a>  in other words, you're going ahead, making an assumption over here by going into construction and spending money, but you haven't met with the city manager, I mean, the mayor and the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2652.727s">So</a>  you went ahead, ahead of time, two months ago, going in there, and now you just decide to go to the city solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2659.508s">No,</a>  that's another inaccuracy.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2661.27s">Why</a>  is it inaccurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2662.431s">You</a>  just said you're meeting tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2663.512s">We</a>  have updated City Hall periodically through this whole process, dating back since last November or December.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2670.279s">So</a>  the Mayor has given you his blessing to put your equipment in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2673.543s">Is</a>  that what you're saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2674.224s">That's</a>  essentially correct, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2676.426s">The</a>  Mayor of Medford said to you, Frank Palleri, Board of Directors at Channel 3, you can put your <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2682.645s">your</a>  equipment here and broadcast from here to that studio.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2686.247s">He</a>  said that to the Tim Kelly Comcast representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2690.128s">Yes</a>  he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2691.269s">And</a>  I think Verizon also knows that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2694.23s">So</a>  we're working again, before I was interrupted, we're working with Comcast and Verizon to go ahead and find out what our capabilities will be at 32 Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2704.595s">and</a>  to go ahead and give the same services, hopefully, that we've been giving the community and our members for well over 25 years.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2714.261s">Point</a>  of further information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2717.403s">You</a>  just used the word, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2720.805s">Give</a>  the same services, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2722.886s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2723.459s">The</a>  word hopefully should never have even been used. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2725.82s">It</a>  should have been able to say, to provide the same services, period.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2728.421s">We</a>  don't know what we're going to be able to offer exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2730.882s">Maybe</a>  things will change a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2732.843s">Maybe</a>  things have to be tweaked. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2734.244s">We</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2734.824s">Until</a>  we get everything built, until we get the internet connection between here and there, we don't know what our capabilities will be.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2741.247s">But</a>  to get here and there, you keep saying here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2744.348s">City</a>  Hall is supposed to be a part of this.</p>

    <p>[Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2746.15s">Are</a>  you controlling where we actually go in City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=2748.773s">Is</a>  that what you're saying?</p>
