1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:02,001
[SPEAKER_03]: You on?

2
00:00:05,902 --> 00:00:08,403
[SPEAKER_03]: The 19th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order.

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:09,363
[SPEAKER_03]: The clerk will call the roll.

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:10,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso?

5
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:11,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

6
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:12,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello?

7
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:13,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

8
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:15,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President De La Rosa?

9
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:15,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

10
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:16,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor McCray?

11
00:00:16,985 --> 00:00:19,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

12
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:19,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

13
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:23,982
[SPEAKER_05]: President Mayorkas.

14
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:24,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

15
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:25,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Six members present, one absent.

16
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Kindly please rise to salute the flag.

17
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:37,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

18
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:42,315
[SPEAKER_03]: On page one, motions, orders, and resolutions.

19
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:45,317
[SPEAKER_03]: 2013-500, offered by Councilor Camuso.

20
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:53,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Department of Public Work repaint the crosswalks at Method Street and Albion Street in the interest of public safety.

21
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Del Russo.

22
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:55,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

23
00:00:56,302 --> 00:01:04,366
[SPEAKER_02]: As the weather gets nicer, the DPW is embarking upon the repainting of the crosswalks, specifically Medford Street and Albion Street.

24
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:10,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Very busy intersection, and a lot of the children in the South Medford neighborhood use that to get to the Columbus School.

25
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,950
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they can get that on the top of the list when they're out there.

26
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:16,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Del Russo.

27
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:18,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with that 100%.

28
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:30,203
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, chiming in here is because Medford street was mentioned, uh, which seems to be more of a gravel path these days.

29
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:49,629
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm wondering if, uh, if the council wouldn't mind me amending this to include that the DPW commissioner, uh, uh, examine ways that we can perhaps resurface Medford street on the motion of council.

30
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's amended by vice president Dello Russo.

31
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:54,575
[SPEAKER_03]: On that motion, Councilor Penta?

32
00:01:54,915 --> 00:02:05,404
[SPEAKER_07]: On that motion, Councilor Dello Russo's amendment, we just got a notice I think today relative to a meeting that's going to take place on June 3rd by the folks that are doing the work over there.

33
00:02:05,444 --> 00:02:10,087
[SPEAKER_07]: So that may be something you may want to bring up for the purpose of letting them pay to do the road.

34
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:13,930
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's in your, pardon me?

35
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,851
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to amend that further?

36
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:15,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, amend it further, yes.

37
00:02:17,383 --> 00:02:18,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you repeat that again?

38
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:22,509
[SPEAKER_07]: The amendment is that the Department of Transportation is having a public meeting on June 3rd.

39
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's in Boston.

40
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:26,054
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a notice today in our emails.

41
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:35,386
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one of six locations, that's the next one coming up, and that will make reference to Councilor Camuso's and Councilor De La Rosa's thoughts relative to Medford Street.

42
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:45,286
[SPEAKER_09]: It's completely germane to the Green Line project and would greatly enhance quality of life visitors.

43
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:48,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you look at the quality of some of the sidewalks in that area.

44
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:55,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like to be critical, but I mean, a lot of them are just lacking.

45
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:58,805
[SPEAKER_09]: And it needs to be addressed.

46
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:13,892
[SPEAKER_09]: We also, I'm sure we all received the same email this weekend that I know a group of neighbors up there had done really tremendous work in addressing some sanitation and rodent issues up there.

47
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:19,775
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've seen additional infractions happening on the other side of the border.

48
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:26,204
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, this is an area that a neighborhood that needs attention.

49
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:37,892
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know a lot of the side streets up there have gotten some over the past couple of years as far as resurfacing, resurfacing, new pipes, sidewalks, and I'd love to see that continue.

50
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:43,416
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso, as amended by Vice President Dello Russo and Councilor Penta, speak on this.

51
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Nominate just for the record, please.

52
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:48,119
[SPEAKER_04]: John Sorrell of Metcalfe Street Method.

53
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to commend Councilor Camuso for bringing this to our attention.

54
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:58,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, but what I wonder is why he singles out this particular crosswalk.

55
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:02,003
[SPEAKER_04]: There are many other crosswalks that need to be taken care of.

56
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:04,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

57
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:05,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a wonderful question.

58
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:16,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but when citizens of Medford that walk that area every day, reach out to any of their elected officials in the community, it's our job to respond in a favorable manner to get it done.

59
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:22,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as people continue to call me regarding city issues, I'm going to keep bringing them up, John.

60
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:23,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't pick and choose issues.

61
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:32,377
[SPEAKER_02]: As I stated in my brief speech, as they're embarking on painting all the crosswalks, but this is one is particular public safety concern.

62
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:39,378
[SPEAKER_02]: where all the kids that are on the other side of Medford Street have to cross a main street to go to an elementary school, the Columbus School.

63
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if I may, they are all dependent upon public safety.

64
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:55,191
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you walk a little further from Albion Street and Medford Street, you go on to Medford and Martin Avenue, that crosswalk needs to be taken care of.

65
00:04:55,532 --> 00:05:01,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you go down another few blocks, right across from the Tufts Pool, kids are crossing that street.

66
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,173
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't see those painted marks.

67
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:06,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Can the record reflect these ones as well?

68
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

69
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:12,600
[SPEAKER_03]: In front of the pool and also on Medford Street.

70
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,042
[SPEAKER_04]: In front of the pool, yeah, that's right.

71
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:16,424
[SPEAKER_04]: When does the pool open, Mr. President?

72
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:18,546
[SPEAKER_03]: First week in July.

73
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:19,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

74
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,428
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's some time.

75
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, point of information, Vice President de la Rousseau.

76
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:25,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't mean to interrupt either one of you, but, uh,

77
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:48,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have to point out that even though, and I agree the crosswalks are faded and in need of attention, but you know, throughout the summer season, the staff at the Tufts pool does a wonderful job at putting up barriers and cones and really bringing attention and focus on the pedestrian traffic in that area.

78
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:51,015
[SPEAKER_09]: So this can only help their efforts.

79
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it will.

80
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:53,321
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

81
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:56,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you go on to Alexander Avenue and Main Street.

82
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,646
[SPEAKER_04]: This is only three blocks down.

83
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:01,068
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going north now on Main Street.

84
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,330
[SPEAKER_04]: That is very, very bad.

85
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:05,132
[SPEAKER_04]: That needs to be taken care of.

86
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:08,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you go four more blocks, you go to Bowdoin Street and Main Street.

87
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:11,037
[SPEAKER_04]: That crosswalk needs attention.

88
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:12,178
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a road, the whole city.

89
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:13,797
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to the whole city.

90
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:14,617
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

91
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:16,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we have a DPW.

92
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:17,199
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they are.

93
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:19,380
[SPEAKER_03]: They are now in the process of repainting.

94
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do it.

95
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,201
[SPEAKER_04]: This, this should be, this comes down.

96
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:24,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President information.

97
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:25,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Council marks.

98
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:37,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, uh, you know, year after year after year, we speak about this time of the year about repainting our crosswalks, which is a major public safety issue in this community.

99
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:39,002
[SPEAKER_17]: year after year after year.

100
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Some years, it takes several months.

101
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:43,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Some years, it takes just a few months.

102
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:53,726
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, Mr. President, it would only make sense from a standpoint of public safety in our community to install thermoplastic crosswalks.

103
00:06:55,066 --> 00:07:02,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Painted crosswalks last one year, if that, and then you're back again painting them immediately if you get to it.

104
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:08,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Thermoplastic crosswalks, their life expectancy is three to five years.

105
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:20,196
[SPEAKER_17]: They're highly reflective, much better than paint, so you can see them from a distance when you're driving, and you can see if someone's in the crosswalk from a distance, and they're slip resistant also.

106
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:26,782
[SPEAKER_17]: We wouldn't have to discuss these issues every single year, when are we gonna get out and paint?

107
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:30,425
[SPEAKER_17]: We gotta get our whole crew at DPW out to paint the crosswalks.

108
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:41,017
[SPEAKER_17]: Wouldn't it be more efficient, not only for public safety reasons, but more efficiency to have a crosswalk painted once every five years rather than five times?

109
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:43,659
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't make any sense, Mr. President.

110
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,540
[SPEAKER_17]: It really doesn't make any sense.

111
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:49,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Thermoplastic crosswalks are a little more expensive.

112
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,001
[SPEAKER_17]: But you know what, the state uses them on the highway.

113
00:07:52,601 --> 00:08:00,123
[SPEAKER_17]: They use them for a reason, because studies have been done to say this is a far better way of marking intersections and crosswalks.

114
00:08:00,403 --> 00:08:08,145
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we're really all interested about truly public safety concerns, we would all be pushing for thermoplastic crosswalks.

115
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:11,186
[SPEAKER_17]: And we wouldn't have to talk for another five years.

116
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:14,508
[SPEAKER_17]: But year after year after year, it gets brought up.

117
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,069
[SPEAKER_17]: We hope the city gets out.

118
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:22,915
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we find out there's 40 in this area that weren't done, another 40 in this area, another 40 in this area.

119
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,576
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we do a piecemeal.

120
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:27,779
[SPEAKER_17]: And by the time we're done with them, the snow starts to come down.

121
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,301
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what happens every year.

122
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:33,323
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what it's going to take to get a handle on it.

123
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:37,587
[SPEAKER_17]: It's no secret, Mr. President, thermoplastic has been in existence for years.

124
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:41,927
[SPEAKER_17]: Federal, state highways, they all use thermoplastic.

125
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Painting is a thing of the past.

126
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:51,232
[SPEAKER_17]: It's almost as bad as marking your streets that need to be swept with paper pamphlets.

127
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:56,976
[SPEAKER_17]: It's almost as archaic as marking your streets with paper pamphlets when you have to do street sweeping.

128
00:08:58,342 --> 00:09:04,527
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know, Mr. President, maybe we should be putting a resolution together as a council saying, you know what, Mr. Mayor?

129
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:08,210
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to see, if it's too late this year, so be it.

130
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:11,113
[SPEAKER_17]: The budget's coming up very shortly.

131
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:14,455
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to start discussion budget in June.

132
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:19,760
[SPEAKER_17]: We should be pushing for thermoplastic crosswalks if there's a cost.

133
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:30,576
[SPEAKER_17]: associated with you, I know there's a cost associated with it, that should be in the budget and then we won't have to discuss public safety issues year after year and we can focus our time on issues of importance.

134
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:38,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, safety is important, but when you have your crosswalks painted, then you can look, with thermoplastic, then you can look at other issues.

135
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:44,260
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't have to keep on refocusing your attention on the same issue year after year after year, Mr. President.

136
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:44,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

137
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:45,901
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President.

138
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, if I may continue, please.

139
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:47,982
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Councilor Camuso.

140
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:48,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Camuso.

141
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:50,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

142
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:54,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one that I got over the weekend was for Dartmouth and Yale.

143
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:59,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent it under suspension, but it's not in our packet to the clerk, so if we could just add it to this resolution.

144
00:09:59,266 --> 00:09:59,726
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be amended.

145
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,610
[SPEAKER_02]: crosswalk.

146
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:03,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

147
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:05,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Karygiannopoulos.

148
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:06,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

149
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:09,093
[SPEAKER_16]: I would support Councilor Marks' resolution in doing that.

150
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:10,654
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have to do them all in one year.

151
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:16,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Every year, you do a certain percentage of them, and eventually they'll be all done.

152
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:21,240
[SPEAKER_16]: If Councilor Marks would make that resolution, I would be more than happy to support that.

153
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:33,108
[SPEAKER_16]: And the long run, it'll be a cost saving, not a cost.

154
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:35,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Spend a little, save a lot.

155
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:40,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Sorello, go ahead.

156
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:48,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, if I may add to that list, one of the major intersections in this city is where Mystic Avenue meets Main Street.

157
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:50,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that crosswalk is faded.

158
00:10:50,452 --> 00:10:52,172
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right across from the police station.

159
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Major traffic there.

160
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:56,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's considered one of the most hazardous intersections in the state.

161
00:10:57,955 --> 00:10:59,016
[SPEAKER_04]: That has to be dealt with.

162
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:05,299
[SPEAKER_04]: But all of this points up to one of the major failings of this administration, and that is lack of maintenance.

163
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,260
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where most of our problems come from.

164
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why the administration doesn't recognize that.

165
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:19,666
[SPEAKER_04]: The administration is willing to spend millions of dollars on buildings such as garages and new pools, et cetera.

166
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:23,527
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these could have been avoided with proper maintenance.

167
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:26,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we visited the pool today up at the high school.

168
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:28,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised.

169
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:30,484
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about that with the committee.

170
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:32,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about, about the pool itself.

171
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:34,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about maintenance and disrepair.

172
00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:35,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you were there.

173
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:39,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was, that area was not maintained at all.

174
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like a dump.

175
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,412
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no need for that.

176
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:44,733
[SPEAKER_04]: All you got to do is throw a crew and they clean it up.

177
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:46,915
[SPEAKER_04]: That ought to be done.

178
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:49,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish it would be done.

179
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:51,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It would save the taxpayers a lot of money.

180
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:52,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

181
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,541
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion to counsel Camuso as amended by vice-president Dello Russo, council Penta.

182
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:57,865
[SPEAKER_03]: and Council Marks.

183
00:11:58,665 --> 00:11:59,285
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

184
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:00,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call.

185
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:01,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call has been requested.

186
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:02,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Call the roll, Mr. Clark.

187
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:06,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And before you call the roll, record Council Member Lungo-Koehn present.

188
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:08,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we call the roll, Council Member Lungo-Koehn.

189
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:18,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to, my point of view is I think the city is doing a good thing with the push of this council and Council Marks putting in the thermoplastic sidewalks.

190
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:19,889
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're doing a pilot.

191
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:25,090
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing a pilot program for three crosswalks in the city that should be done within the next

192
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:27,265
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was four or five months.

193
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,626
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we are moving in a step in the right direction.

194
00:12:30,786 --> 00:12:44,209
[SPEAKER_00]: If that works, I do agree that we should do many more throughout our community at a rate that we can afford, whether it's five or six per year, however much it costs, that we are able just to afford being able to do that.

195
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,109
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it is a way to go.

196
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:50,090
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the paint, I agree, lasts not even a full season.

197
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:56,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And we makes it through to the beginning of fall and it's just not effective for the rest of the year.

198
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:57,935
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a way to go.

199
00:12:57,955 --> 00:13:03,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that we see how the pilot program goes and do it in stages so that we can afford it.

200
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:05,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Call the roll.

201
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:06,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clark on that.

202
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:06,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh,

203
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion, Councilor Marks.

204
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,961
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to mention what my colleague mentioned.

205
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:13,422
[SPEAKER_17]: The pilot program is for raised crosswalks.

206
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,906
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm mentioning about thermoplastic crosswalk, which is very different than a raised crosswalk.

207
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:20,487
[SPEAKER_17]: Although I support both initiatives.

208
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Just want to set the record straight on that.

209
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:24,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

210
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

211
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

212
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:28,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

213
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:29,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

214
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:30,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Dello Russo.

215
00:13:31,193 --> 00:13:31,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

216
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:32,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor O'Kerren.

217
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:32,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

218
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:34,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

219
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:35,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

220
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:36,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta.

221
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:38,208
[SPEAKER_05]: President Mayorkas.

222
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:38,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

223
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And about a 70 affirmative.

224
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:45,314
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the negative papers approved as amended 2013 5 0 1 offered by council Caraviello.

225
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:53,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Be a resolve that the city council discussed the status in locations of dog parks in the city of Medford council care of yellow.

226
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:55,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, thank you, Mr. President.

227
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:58,484
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, uh, as we said, you know, the weather's starting to get nice out there.

228
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:00,125
[SPEAKER_16]: People are walking the dogs.

229
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, they're asking, uh, about the dog park that's been proposed before.

230
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:09,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Where's the funding that we had for it and where it's going to be?

231
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:15,707
[SPEAKER_16]: There seems to be some confusion and rumor floating around of where the dark pocket is going to be.

232
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:21,849
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to have the mayor give his proposal on that.

233
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,550
[SPEAKER_03]: On that motion, Councilor Caraviello?

234
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Further?

235
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:28,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta?

236
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:34,072
[SPEAKER_07]: On that motion, could we get a copy of where the

237
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:39,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Dog packs and the amount of money was supposed to be coming from October of 2011.

238
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:42,437
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor made a public announcement.

239
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:49,844
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been talking about dog packs since 2011, because that was supposed to have been part of the mitigation that F.W.

240
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:50,585
[SPEAKER_07]: White, or J.F.

241
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:52,927
[SPEAKER_07]: White, was supposed to be giving the city of Medford for the FAST-14.

242
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:55,529
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've never seen the dog pack.

243
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:59,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Could we just get the handle on what that mitigation terminology was on dog packs?

244
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:02,597
[SPEAKER_07]: $50,000.

245
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:02,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

246
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:05,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd just like to get the proper termination.

247
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:07,621
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, it was amended by Councilor Pinto.

248
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:08,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

249
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:09,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

250
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:23,071
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, at this weekend's memorial, uh, ceremony, I had a resident come up to me and hand me a list of, uh, 13 names of just residents in his area, uh, of people that support a dog park.

251
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:27,514
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, if you look at the list, Mr. President's Lowell court,

252
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:37,653
[SPEAKER_17]: Rockwell Ave, Pool Street, Evans Street, Middlesex Ave, Chipman, Burnside, Lawrence,

253
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:42,054
[SPEAKER_17]: Hurlcroft, Spring Street, Central Ave.

254
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:50,639
[SPEAKER_17]: These are residents, Mr. President, name and phone number of people that support a dog park just in a small general area off of Central Ave.

255
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,823
[SPEAKER_17]: A small area that this gentleman went out and just got a number of signatures of people that support a dog park.

256
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,064
[SPEAKER_17]: You can take this list.

257
00:15:58,644 --> 00:16:03,547
[SPEAKER_17]: and a hundred fold throughout the community, people are wondering where this dog park is.

258
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:11,453
[SPEAKER_17]: It was several weeks ago that I offered a resolution and Mr. Clerk, I don't know if it's been answered or not by the mayor, asking for the status of the dog park.

259
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:13,274
[SPEAKER_17]: Where is the dog park?

260
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:19,478
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't believe we got a response back from the mayor and that was voted on this council, by this council, seven weeks ago.

261
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:37,358
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what's happening, but if the mayor's gonna make statements that he received mitigation and what the mitigation is and so forth, then at the very least, residents should hold him accountable to what was stated.

262
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:45,880
[SPEAKER_17]: If part of the mitigation for the Bridge Fast 14 project was a dog park, then where is the dog park?

263
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a location, Mr. Mayor?

264
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's working on this?

265
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you create an advisory committee?

266
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:53,713
[SPEAKER_17]: What's going on?

267
00:16:53,793 --> 00:16:54,895
[SPEAKER_17]: All we want is a status.

268
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:58,996
[SPEAKER_17]: I know things don't happen overnight, but all we want is a status.

269
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:06,840
[SPEAKER_17]: So for those thousands of pet owners in this community that want a place that their dog can run free, because that's what a dog park is.

270
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:11,023
[SPEAKER_17]: When you take your dog to a local park now, they have to be leashed.

271
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,584
[SPEAKER_17]: They can't run free.

272
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:21,569
[SPEAKER_17]: This would be similar to the dog park that's in Somerville, the dog park that's in Cambridge, and all the surrounding communities that do have currently dog parks right now.

273
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:24,771
[SPEAKER_17]: This would allow them to exercise and run their dogs.

274
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:30,855
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not asking for anything other than what the mayor said he negotiated.

275
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:34,016
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

276
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:34,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

277
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:36,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caraviello.

278
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:37,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you again, Mr. President.

279
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:40,680
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to see the mayor appoint some type of committee.

280
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,241
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we have a bicycle commission now.

281
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:51,766
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know why we can't have half a dozen residents of the community sit down and maybe propose some spots for these dog parks.

282
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:54,148
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you could add that onto the amendment.

283
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amended by Councilor Caraviello.

284
00:17:58,346 --> 00:17:59,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Camuso.

285
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:00,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

286
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:02,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for bringing this up.

287
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It is something that we need to have answers to.

288
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:13,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that some of the locations that were suggested got a little pushback from some of the neighbors because

289
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:24,285
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog park is great, but when you look at an area like the Sheepfold, it's very secluded, it's out of the way, people don't have to hear the dogs barking at 6 a.m.

290
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:26,647
[SPEAKER_02]: and the feces on the ground.

291
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:36,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So, with that being said, I think there has to be some sort of a committee with neighborhood input from any area that the mayor may be proposing this.

292
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:43,841
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of the Council of Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Penta, Vice President Dello Russo,

293
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:49,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to commend Councilor Caraviello in suggesting that a committee be appointed.

294
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:50,193
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a wonderful thing.

295
00:18:50,213 --> 00:19:06,706
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I spoke tonight up at the pool when we were examining that and the need to encourage opportunities when the pool is restored for people to participate in that as far as exercising leadership in the maintenance and operation of the pool facility.

296
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:13,843
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, because those oftentimes bring out the best in people.

297
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:20,912
[SPEAKER_09]: And having enthusiasts for dogs and pets to participate in

298
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:34,546
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, establishing this, uh, new facility in the city, uh, for, for the dogs and, and for them to have their exercise and ability to, uh, uh, perhaps live, uh, in a more unrestrained way.

299
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:37,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's wonderful opportunity for people to be involved.

300
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:39,087
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thank you, counselor.

301
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:50,051
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, I lend my support to this, uh, uh, motion, Mr. President on the motion as amended when a roll call vote on the roll, Mr. Clark.

302
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso?

303
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:54,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

304
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:55,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello?

305
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:55,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

306
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:57,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Dello Russo?

307
00:19:57,524 --> 00:19:57,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

308
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:58,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor McCurran?

309
00:19:58,905 --> 00:19:58,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

310
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:00,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

311
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:00,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

312
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:01,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta?

313
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:01,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

314
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:03,509
[SPEAKER_05]: President Mayorkas?

315
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:03,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

316
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:08,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna vote a seven affirmative, none of the negative papers approved as amended.

317
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:19,282
[SPEAKER_03]: On page one, 2013 502 offered by Councilor Penta, be resolved that the misleading information at last Tuesday's council meeting that channel three can broadcast from their newly

318
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:30,556
[SPEAKER_03]: rented location on Riverside Avenue be discussed in the interest and at the expense, uh, and at the expense of cable TV subscribers, uh, council Peta.

319
00:20:30,836 --> 00:20:32,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President last Tuesday night.

320
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:48,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I thought we had a very informative conversation and after I went back and I reviewed the tape, um, I, I, I think to some degree we will mislead or at least I was misled because I asked the question as a related is the new location on Salem street going to have the capacity

321
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,963
[SPEAKER_07]: to do a broadcast from there.

322
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:57,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer was yes from the manager of the station.

323
00:20:57,945 --> 00:21:06,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, subsequent to that, immediately following the meeting, the transmission of the module, or whatever you want to call the terminology, was in the corner of the room over there.

324
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:19,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And the conversation finally alluded to the fact that on Riverside Avenue, there is absolutely no Comcast, and there is no Verizon capacity to do broadcasting or to bring cable in.

325
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:35,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you remember correctly, Mr. President, it was you who brought up this issue, I think some five to seven years ago, relative to a business client on High Street who was trying to get Comcast, I think, or Verizon, into the building over there.

326
00:21:35,113 --> 00:21:36,394
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Comcast.

327
00:21:36,774 --> 00:21:47,758
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that point in time, I believe there was, in our conversation, I believe we had someone from Channel 3, and I don't know who, so I don't want to mention any names.

328
00:21:48,291 --> 00:22:00,298
[SPEAKER_07]: because I'd be absolutely wrong, but I remember somebody from Channel 3 indicating that that was one of the problems that we had in Meffitt Square, the inability or the lack of capacity to have broadcasting in the downtown Meffitt Square area, which seems to be pretty kind of evident.

329
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:11,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, again, from the conversation that took place last Tuesday night and from the information that was ascertained, there is a two-year contract signed, I believe, at 32 Salem Street, Riverside Avenue, excuse me,

330
00:22:13,507 --> 00:22:14,328
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no Comcast.

331
00:22:14,348 --> 00:22:15,328
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no Verizon there.

332
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:22,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So how do you broadcast out of have a full-fledged studio if you don't have that capacity to broadcast from there?

333
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:30,421
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's going on now, if I understand all of this correctly, is the modular transmission, lack of terminology.

334
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:31,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the proper terminology.

335
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:37,386
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's here in this particular building, or it was brought here in this particular building.

336
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:38,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's still here.

337
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:49,587
[SPEAKER_07]: And the whole idea is that the transmission would come from Verizon or Comcast to City Hall, and then they would somehow bounce it to 32 Riverside Avenue.

338
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:51,288
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm saying to myself, well, wait a minute.

339
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:52,808
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this all about?

340
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:58,391
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not having a full-fledged studio that's equipped on its own merits at its own location.

341
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:00,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I started to think about this thing even more.

342
00:23:00,952 --> 00:23:03,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm saying to myself, we have a concern here.

343
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:07,135
[SPEAKER_07]: We're putting channel-free equipment into Medford City Hall.

344
00:23:07,915 --> 00:23:13,299
[SPEAKER_07]: And by putting Channel 3 equipment into Medford City Hall, are we talking about having a liability issue here?

345
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:15,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we talking about the equipment here in City Hall?

346
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:17,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we talking about the access to City Hall?

347
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:19,904
[SPEAKER_07]: The keys and who would have keys to City Hall?

348
00:23:20,184 --> 00:23:27,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Who would be coming into City Hall if, in fact, something were to go wrong in the transmission from City Hall to 32 Riverside Avenue?

349
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:29,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a whole host of questions here.

350
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:32,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And the city has a liability policy as it relates to being a self-insured.

351
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:36,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we all know that Channel 3 is a separate private nonprofit corporation.

352
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:40,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, we have two separate entities here running around.

353
00:23:41,674 --> 00:23:54,142
[SPEAKER_07]: We were also told at that point in time that there was, I believe, less than $100,000 operating budget that they were operating in, but there is another budget for whatever that might be worth.

354
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:57,564
[SPEAKER_07]: So I tried to get down there on two separate occasions on Riverside Avenue.

355
00:23:57,624 --> 00:23:58,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Both times I couldn't get in.

356
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:01,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Both times the door was locked, but on one particular day,

357
00:24:02,022 --> 00:24:07,424
[SPEAKER_07]: The paper was down, I did have a chance to look in, and it didn't look like there was hardly any work, if any work at all was taking place down there.

358
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:09,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this goes back to March of this year.

359
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,486
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we have a station manager that's getting paid.

360
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:15,087
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no transmission, no broadcasting coming forward.

361
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:25,852
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, for whatever the reason might be, if in fact the city of Medford is now being a part of whatever Channel 3 is going to be involved with, if the mayor is doing this, I have no idea why Channel 3 would even be here.

362
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:36,437
[SPEAKER_07]: and entertaining City Hall, but more importantly, why would they even want to stay on Riverside Avenue with no access to cable television, Verizon or Comcast?

363
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:54,570
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, poor choice, they've been around, they know the situation, they know what Medford Square is about, they know what Riverside Ave is all about, and that was a poor choice to go there, especially being in the business for, they're not novice, these people that are working there, and they're a part of Channel 3, they've been around for a while, they know what's going on.

364
00:24:55,424 --> 00:25:02,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And since they know what's going on, the sad part about this is they've got themselves locked into a contract for which I would assume, I would hope that they would be able to get out of.

365
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And even if they had to get sued, who cares about getting sued?

366
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:11,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the time that you're costing the city, the taxpayers, each of the rate payers, each and every cable bill are paying for something.

367
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:16,018
[SPEAKER_07]: You're paying for station manager that has no job to do because there's nothing being programmed.

368
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:16,919
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing being taped.

369
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:27,948
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it dawned on me yesterday while we were at the cemetery and we were listening to the speeches being made and watching the people that were there and the observance, where is all this portable equipment?

370
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:41,222
[SPEAKER_07]: The portable equipment that Channel 3 has had through the years from the thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars that subscribers have not only paid, but the city of Medford has transferred over to Channel 3 through the years.

371
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:46,135
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have had people out there with portable cameras doing the portable televising of it.

372
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:55,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, if in fact, and when they do come back on, that they would have a whole host of things to put on, the Memorial Day service, graduations, whatever it might be.

373
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,984
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't see any of that around.

374
00:25:57,825 --> 00:25:59,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we were told there's 10 board of directors.

375
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:08,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea who the board of directors are, and I would hope they would come forward and let us know who these board of directors are so we could get a handle on what the makeup of the board is.

376
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:27,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, I believe one of the situations that came up, going back and reviewing Judge Jackson's report, that the city paid over $15,000 on, Melanson and Heath, the city's auditor, on one particular year, going back, I believe it was just before or after Judge Jackson, indicated there was, on a $15,000 account, $5,000 was totally unaccounted for.

377
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:29,226
[SPEAKER_07]: No receipts, no records, totally unaccounted for.

378
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:45,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I know I see one of the folks sitting in the audience, I don't know which one it is, but I know he came to the podium one night and he said it was a combination of sloppy bookkeeping, not keeping the records accurate, but we're going to do a better job and all of that.

379
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:57,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, our resolution last week was to ask for an audit, a complete audit on channel three for the last three years and have that forwarded to the city because the rate payers really have no other alternative.

380
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:58,908
[SPEAKER_07]: but to either go to the mirror.

381
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:04,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's obvious that the mirror is either failing to do anything, doesn't want to do anything, afraid to do something.

382
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:11,712
[SPEAKER_07]: So the people's voice, which is at this podium right now, is nothing more than asking, what is really going on over there?

383
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:23,056
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, why would you want to put a TV station for cable subscribers for public access at a location that has no accessibility to the cable?

384
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:24,496
[SPEAKER_07]: That's number one.

385
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:26,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, why wasn't that thought out ahead of time

386
00:27:27,216 --> 00:27:29,278
[SPEAKER_07]: to know that cable access could not go there.

387
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:38,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And number three, more importantly, you know, they should go out and find another spot and think about what really cable access is here within this community and what it should be.

388
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:44,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the taxpayers and the rate payers, as Councilor Caraviello alluded to last Tuesday night, they're getting ripped off each and every month.

389
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,031
[SPEAKER_07]: There should be an accounting for that money.

390
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:47,572
[SPEAKER_07]: There should be a credit coming back.

391
00:27:47,952 --> 00:27:52,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And the City of Medford should not be holding that money available for Channel 3 if they're not broadcasting.

392
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:58,106
[SPEAKER_07]: People are getting paid for doing no work, because there's no work to be done over there, and there's no broadcasting.

393
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:17,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So, with that being said, Mr. President, I think we really need to get an answer from our city solicitor as it relates to, is the city of Medford using a public building for the purposes of having transmission out of this building to 32 Riverside Avenue for the purposes of having public access cable television?

394
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:22,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's the case, what is, if any, legal ramifications that might be involved?

395
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:41,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go back to the other issue, Mr. Clark, who comes into the building, who's going to handle the phone calls, who's going to have a set of keys, who's going to be responsible for the equipment, who's going to be responsible for the city's equipment, who's going to be responsible for what's in this building if somebody from Channel 3 or one of their designees comes into this building for whatever the reasons might be.

396
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:46,890
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the sad part about not having this all in one place with the ability to be

397
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,581
[SPEAKER_07]: accessed in and out of one place.

398
00:28:49,661 --> 00:29:05,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And to come here in City Hall now, after the fact, having whatever the tenure was in 5 High Street, whatever that lawsuit might be all about, whatever the reason why they left there, it doesn't make any sense that they would go to another place that gives them less opportunity for the purposes of broadcasting on a daily basis.

399
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,971
[SPEAKER_07]: On motion to Councilor Penta, Vice President Del Russo.

400
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:16,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a point of information, Mr. President, and maybe Councilor Penta could refresh my mind.

401
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:18,956
[SPEAKER_09]: When was the Judge Jackson report issued?

402
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Penta, through the chair.

403
00:29:31,802 --> 00:29:32,122
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

404
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:34,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

405
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:35,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

406
00:29:35,503 --> 00:29:37,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

407
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:45,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And very similar to the way that the Medford housing is a separate but connected entity, so is TV3.

408
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:50,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I received the Judge Jackson report from our city solicitor.

409
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:56,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So our city solicitor has involvement with TV3 on some level.

410
00:29:58,111 --> 00:30:03,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that there is a coupling and an overlap between Medford, Medford residents and TV3.

411
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:04,733
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is our asset.

412
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:14,556
[SPEAKER_01]: It is our asset and it should be used hand in glove with the Chevalier Auditorium and with the Condon Shell and all of the rest of the arts community

413
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:22,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And at best, and I'm glad Mr. Palleri is here in the room, because he's the one that can answer some questions.

414
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:25,647
[SPEAKER_01]: At best, there's mismanagement.

415
00:30:26,228 --> 00:30:43,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not accusing anybody of anything illegal or inappropriate, but at best, this channel is being mismanaged at such an incredible level that if $5,000 was missing from Bank of America, somebody would be paying for that.

416
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:50,822
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no station currently working right now.

417
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,404
[SPEAKER_01]: We need that station.

418
00:30:52,444 --> 00:30:53,605
[SPEAKER_01]: We need it as a public voice.

419
00:30:53,625 --> 00:31:00,312
[SPEAKER_01]: But $200,000 a year they get, and I want to know where the money is.

420
00:31:00,612 --> 00:31:04,536
[SPEAKER_01]: $200,000 from everyone that pays a Verizon bill or a Comcast bill.

421
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:07,183
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called the franchise fee.

422
00:31:07,223 --> 00:31:08,084
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the back of your bill.

423
00:31:08,564 --> 00:31:10,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you very much for listening to me.

424
00:31:10,206 --> 00:31:13,929
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a huge issue in the culture of MedFed.

425
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:16,692
[SPEAKER_01]: MedFed's ability to connect for

426
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:25,305
[SPEAKER_01]: videotaping hockey games, football games, political events, the memorial service that we had yesterday.

427
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:29,867
[SPEAKER_01]: It is part of the vibrancy that could be part of MedFed and MedFed's future.

428
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:32,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And why it's not up and running?

429
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:36,410
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not up and running, it's completely being mismanaged.

430
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:44,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And not for nothing, but somebody should be replaced or removed, not in any bad way, but just because they're incompetent.

431
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:48,919
[SPEAKER_01]: is incompetent at Channel 3, that's in charge.

432
00:31:49,819 --> 00:32:01,244
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the mayor cannot adjust that, if the mayor cannot take care of this problem, then we need to go to the FCC or whatever other authorities have control over TV3.

433
00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:12,048
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the FCC, it could be the tax code because they're a non-profit, whoever it is that's the outside authorities, because the mayor has not taken care of this issue.

434
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:13,549
[SPEAKER_01]: With all due respect, sir.

435
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,081
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor has not taken care of this issue.

436
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:18,143
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been going on for years and years and years.

437
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:37,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at all of the past meetings that we've had in city council, and you can go on YouTube and find them and just put in TV3 or Mr. Penter or my name or some other councilor's name, and you will get the YouTubes of the topics being brought up here.

438
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:40,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a respectful TV3 channel.

439
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fire somebody if that's necessary.

440
00:32:42,848 --> 00:32:44,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not accusing them of anything illegal.

441
00:32:44,989 --> 00:32:47,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I am accusing them of incompetence, though.

442
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Without a doubt, somebody has been incompetent in this.

443
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:53,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll do respect to Mr. Poleri.

444
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,594
[SPEAKER_01]: But somebody needs to be replaced.

445
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:56,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

446
00:32:57,716 --> 00:32:58,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

447
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:05,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

448
00:33:06,423 --> 00:33:08,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Frank Leary, 39 Everett Street, Medford.

449
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:12,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Boy, this is getting tiring.

450
00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:24,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to tell you, every four years or so, we have to come up here due to inaccurate allegations from

451
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,492
[SPEAKER_08]: this side of the council.

452
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:45,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize in my general discussion here today, when I'm talking about the councilors, I mean to exclude Councilor Marks, Councilor Camuso, and Councilor Dello Russo, and perhaps Councilor Caraviello.

453
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:48,092
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no missing money.

454
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:52,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know where you get that, but Bob, you did say something that I finally agree with.

455
00:33:52,816 --> 00:33:53,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.

456
00:33:53,437 --> 00:33:57,620
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been since 1986 since I've been affiliated with TV three.

457
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:04,226
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is, we are an autonomous corporation, not part of the city.

458
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,308
[SPEAKER_08]: You can ask for anything you want.

459
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:09,550
[SPEAKER_08]: We are a corporation.

460
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,572
[SPEAKER_08]: You can find our records.

461
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:13,714
[SPEAKER_07]: While you might be autonomous legally,

462
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:22,191
[SPEAKER_07]: You are taking ratepayers' money for which the mayor of this community overrides your corporation, because he administers Channel 3.

463
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:25,393
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the executive director, and technically, of your Channel 3.

464
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:28,995
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's not taking any action for whatever the reason is.

465
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:32,637
[SPEAKER_07]: So you feel as though it's your duty to go ahead and take action?

466
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:37,340
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my duty to let the taxpayer, ratepayer know that that Channel 3 is not operating.

467
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,601
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be operating.

468
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:42,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is something wrong, especially when you're bringing equipment into this building

469
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:45,515
[SPEAKER_07]: and trying to make the modular or the transmission go from here to there.

470
00:34:45,695 --> 00:34:48,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Why didn't you just go to another place that had access?

471
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,116
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is it that you want?

472
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:54,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want us to be on the air, or do you want us to not be on the air?

473
00:34:54,697 --> 00:34:55,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little confused.

474
00:34:55,757 --> 00:34:56,818
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing to be confused.

475
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:57,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't play the game tonight, Frank.

476
00:34:58,018 --> 00:35:05,380
[SPEAKER_07]: The bottom line is you're in a place that you had no right going to because there was no access, and you've taken two months worth of ratepayers' money that they're paying each and every

477
00:35:05,993 --> 00:35:08,034
[SPEAKER_07]: You're paying people at work that have no job to go to.

478
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:09,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me give you a little history, Bob.

479
00:35:09,595 --> 00:35:10,836
[SPEAKER_07]: No, let me give you the history.

480
00:35:11,036 --> 00:35:12,096
[SPEAKER_07]: The history is this, Frank.

481
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:14,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Frank, Frank, the history is this.

482
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,680
[SPEAKER_07]: He hasn't earned my respect, Mr. President.

483
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you haven't earned mine either.

484
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,581
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any difference.

485
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:20,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Council Penta.

486
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:21,942
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on Riverside Avenue.

487
00:35:21,982 --> 00:35:25,904
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in a place that does not have access to cable, Verizon, or Comcast.

488
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,247
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not operating, and the tax rate payers in this community are not getting their money's worth.

489
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:31,087
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the bottom line.

490
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:31,928
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

491
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:33,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So why did you go there?

492
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:34,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Answer that question.

493
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:36,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did you go to a place knowing that there was no access?

494
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:45,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not going to discuss what the board of directors has decided with you or any counselor in a forum such as this.

495
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:51,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of the forum, last week, you in particular, Councilor Penta,

496
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,603
[SPEAKER_08]: took our station manager to task over several different items.

497
00:35:56,063 --> 00:35:56,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what?

498
00:35:56,383 --> 00:35:58,845
[SPEAKER_08]: The board of directors did not appreciate it.

499
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, who are the board of directors?

500
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:01,748
[SPEAKER_07]: He said there was 10 of them.

501
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:02,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know the 10 of them?

502
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:04,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Who said there were 10?

503
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Sano, your director.

504
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:06,912
[SPEAKER_08]: There were not 10.

505
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:08,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what he said.

506
00:36:08,272 --> 00:36:08,873
[SPEAKER_07]: He told us they were 10.

507
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,093
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not 10.

508
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:13,635
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be posted up on our website when we start doing statuses.

509
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:14,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how many, Frank, don't dance around.

510
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:16,176
[SPEAKER_08]: How many board of directors do you have?

511
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:17,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me give a little history.

512
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:18,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me give a little history.

513
00:36:19,197 --> 00:36:23,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Poleri, Mr. Poleri, Mr. Poleri, please.

514
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:26,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Poleri, how many board of directors do you have?

515
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,541
[SPEAKER_08]: We have up to 11.

516
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:31,763
[SPEAKER_07]: No, how many do you have right now, active?

517
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:32,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say six.

518
00:36:32,844 --> 00:36:33,364
[SPEAKER_07]: You have six.

519
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:35,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So your station manager was wrong when he said 10.

520
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:38,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't watch.

521
00:36:38,168 --> 00:36:38,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't hear.

522
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:40,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what was stated.

523
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:41,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what he said, 10.

524
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:42,851
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

525
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:47,914
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, that's another accurate statement that you've made here tonight, I guess.

526
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:48,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Pardon me?

527
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:50,776
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another accurate statement you made tonight.

528
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:52,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me give you a little history about TV3.

529
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:54,419
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't want any history.

530
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:55,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, we're not here.

531
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,101
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the resolution.

532
00:36:57,438 --> 00:37:00,340
[SPEAKER_07]: The resolution's not about a history of TV3 to dance around the subject.

533
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,821
[SPEAKER_07]: The subject matter is very simple.

534
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:05,403
[SPEAKER_07]: The rate payers have no one to go to, because the mayor is not doing anything.

535
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:09,065
[SPEAKER_07]: So when they come to a council or a council law— Well, that's for you to discuss with the mayor, isn't it?

536
00:37:09,385 --> 00:37:09,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Pardon me?

537
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:11,447
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for you to discuss with the mayor.

538
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:12,527
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not for me to discuss with the mayor.

539
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:12,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

540
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:15,149
[SPEAKER_08]: If the mayor doesn't want to— We're an autonomous corporation.

541
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:17,751
[SPEAKER_06]: You may be autonomous in your mind.

542
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:19,472
[SPEAKER_07]: In your mind, you might be autonomous.

543
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:24,277
[SPEAKER_07]: But you are using ratepayers' money.

544
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:29,902
[SPEAKER_07]: You're taking ratepayers' money that the mayor is giving to you because of the contract.

545
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:31,063
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have no access.

546
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:31,943
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no television.

547
00:37:32,123 --> 00:37:33,244
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no broadcasting.

548
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:36,988
[SPEAKER_07]: You're paying for people that don't have a job to go to for two months plus more.

549
00:37:37,008 --> 00:37:37,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me.

550
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:41,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm really serious.

551
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:43,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you sitting there being serious right now?

552
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm more serious than you would know, yes.

553
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,731
[SPEAKER_08]: You're ridiculous, Councilor Pinto.

554
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:49,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, tell me why you're not broadcasting.

555
00:37:49,071 --> 00:37:50,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, you're ridiculous.

556
00:37:50,132 --> 00:37:50,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you not broadcasting?

557
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:53,413
[SPEAKER_06]: And for you to come down there to a building to try to get in.

558
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:54,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you not broadcasting?

559
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:55,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me why you're not broadcasting.

560
00:37:55,213 --> 00:37:56,394
[SPEAKER_06]: You have my phone number, Robert Diamond.

561
00:37:56,414 --> 00:37:58,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me why you're not broadcasting.

562
00:37:58,254 --> 00:37:59,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I will talk one-on-one with you.

563
00:37:59,675 --> 00:38:00,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Why aren't you broadcasting?

564
00:38:00,735 --> 00:38:02,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me why you're not broadcasting.

565
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:03,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, I'm not.

566
00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:04,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you not?

567
00:38:04,036 --> 00:38:05,516
[SPEAKER_07]: He has to answer the question, Mr. President.

568
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:09,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor President, when can I go ahead and talk about something else?

569
00:38:09,598 --> 00:38:10,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Get my 10 minutes to talk.

570
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:12,675
[SPEAKER_08]: about what happened last night.

571
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:16,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, I wanna know why you're not broadcasting it on Riverside Avenue.

572
00:38:16,438 --> 00:38:17,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'll get to it.

573
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:20,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Answer it, I don't want a long history, just tell me the reason why.

574
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,881
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, go ahead, go ahead with your statement.

575
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:22,642
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your answer?

576
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

577
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:31,048
[SPEAKER_08]: History tells us when we incorporated 1984, and I'll talk fast, because it can be long-winded.

578
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:33,970
[SPEAKER_08]: In 86, we actually opened up a little bit.

579
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,731
[SPEAKER_08]: We hired staff in 85.

580
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:39,494
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time the equipment and everything got up, it was not done overnight.

581
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,240
[SPEAKER_08]: We moved out of the high school to Canal Street.

582
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,021
[SPEAKER_08]: That took over a year and a half.

583
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:47,341
[SPEAKER_08]: We renovated a building.

584
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:48,341
[SPEAKER_08]: We gutted a building.

585
00:38:48,721 --> 00:38:53,142
[SPEAKER_08]: We purchased well over $250,000 worth of equipment.

586
00:38:53,823 --> 00:38:55,683
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to move out of that location.

587
00:38:55,743 --> 00:38:57,664
[SPEAKER_08]: We moved to 5 High Street.

588
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:00,464
[SPEAKER_08]: We went ahead and did renovations.

589
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,805
[SPEAKER_08]: That took approximately, I'll say, a year.

590
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:04,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't hold me to it.

591
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:05,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Could have been 14 months.

592
00:39:06,026 --> 00:39:07,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Could have been 11 months.

593
00:39:07,706 --> 00:39:09,287
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we're doing another move.

594
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:12,972
[SPEAKER_08]: We moved to 32 Riverside Avenue.

595
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:26,595
[SPEAKER_08]: So every time we've moved, every time we've set up the corporation, it has taken months, if not more than a year, to go ahead, do renovations, buy the equipment, outfit.

596
00:39:27,035 --> 00:39:28,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Mr. President.

597
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:29,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Powell.

598
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:30,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick question for you.

599
00:39:31,256 --> 00:39:33,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did you move from 5 High Street to 32 Riverside Avenue?

600
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:37,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the board of directors went ahead and approved the move.

601
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:39,118
[SPEAKER_08]: We were having some issues with 5 High Street.

602
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:41,475
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're having issues at 5 High Street.

603
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:44,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you know that there was a high water table?

604
00:39:44,777 --> 00:39:45,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

605
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:47,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I also know that the city's Board of Health went down there too.

606
00:39:48,158 --> 00:39:48,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do know.

607
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,240
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to move for the safety of our members.

608
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Just answer a simple question, Frank.

609
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:58,483
[SPEAKER_07]: 32 Riverside Ave does not have Verizon or Comcast.

610
00:39:58,603 --> 00:39:59,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did you go there knowing that?

611
00:39:59,624 --> 00:40:00,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't right now.

612
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:01,084
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

613
00:40:01,104 --> 00:40:02,725
[SPEAKER_07]: You went there knowing it didn't have it.

614
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:03,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

615
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:05,306
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's not necessarily true.

616
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:08,748
[SPEAKER_08]: You're making an assumption that we knew it didn't have it.

617
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:12,869
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have internet connectivity down there.

618
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:13,409
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

619
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:14,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to talk about that.

620
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:17,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I will kind of wrap that up a little bit at the end.

621
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:22,632
[SPEAKER_08]: So historically, what we've done is when we've had to move, we have to go ahead.

622
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not just, oh, hey, plug in this VCR.

623
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:26,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, DVD player.

624
00:40:27,373 --> 00:40:28,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, put the camera here.

625
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:30,274
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not how it works.

626
00:40:30,774 --> 00:40:36,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though you have some people, a couple of people in this room that'll tell you, oh, I'd have it up in two days.

627
00:40:36,576 --> 00:40:37,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd have it up in a month.

628
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:38,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what?

629
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,757
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not reality.

630
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:41,614
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't happen.

631
00:40:42,094 --> 00:40:53,402
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the fourth time we've either outfitted for the first time or moved and had to build a station from scratch that didn't have a station.

632
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:55,303
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't happen overnight.

633
00:40:55,863 --> 00:40:58,825
[SPEAKER_08]: We start broadcasting April 1st.

634
00:40:59,506 --> 00:41:01,867
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the last time we had an on-air presence.

635
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:10,113
[SPEAKER_08]: We are now in communications with Comcast, and we have been actually, and Verizon, and the mayor's office.

636
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:12,879
[SPEAKER_08]: and in City Hall.

637
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Mr. President.

638
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did you bring your transmitter over here last week and have it stored here?

639
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:21,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you were going to transmit here and then from here it's going to bounce back there.

640
00:41:21,123 --> 00:41:21,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Why'd you do that?

641
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:35,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Comcast has gone ahead and talked to City Hall, the Mayor, the Mayor's office and his representatives and Comcast has a feed here that would be cost effective for us to broadcast out of.

642
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:40,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So you cannot broadcast legitimately on your own at 32 Riverside Avenue?

643
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:40,935
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not true.

644
00:41:41,795 --> 00:41:42,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget City Hall.

645
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:45,537
[SPEAKER_08]: In the event that we want to spend thousands of dollars to do it.

646
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:46,878
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot do it, Frank.

647
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:51,920
[SPEAKER_07]: You just got through saying there's a feed here, which is going to allow you to broadcast them there.

648
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,982
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot go to 32 Riverside Avenue on its own without City Hall.

649
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:56,702
[SPEAKER_07]: You need City Hall.

650
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,543
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the bottom line.

651
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:03,366
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we'd prefer to have City Hall's input and their assistance on this.

652
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:04,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

653
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:10,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of paying $15,000 to get a cable drop at 32 Riverside Ave.

654
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:13,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So why don't you just go someplace that had cable accessibility?

655
00:42:13,577 --> 00:42:15,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, unfortunately, that's not going to happen.

656
00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:16,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, why didn't you?

657
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:16,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Why didn't you look it up?

658
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:17,860
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been around here long enough.

659
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,860
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the business.

660
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:20,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be perfectly honest with you.

661
00:42:22,283 --> 00:42:27,446
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought the whole square was wired up with Comcast and Verizon.

662
00:42:27,906 --> 00:42:31,409
[SPEAKER_08]: We had never heard that any part of the square

663
00:42:32,065 --> 00:42:33,345
[SPEAKER_08]: did not have cable.

664
00:42:33,445 --> 00:42:34,426
[SPEAKER_08]: That's absolutely not true.

665
00:42:34,466 --> 00:42:48,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilman Iacocca, so a few years ago, five, six years ago, brought up that issue, and your people were here one night when we had a discussion on how Cable Comcast was being broadcast, and as a matter of fact, it went all the way to Haines Square, and it was a business person.

666
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:49,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, who's the person?

667
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:51,210
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you saying the whole square isn't wired?

668
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:52,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you're saying?

669
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,524
[SPEAKER_07]: My belief is Riverside Avenue going up to High Street is not wired.

670
00:42:56,904 --> 00:42:57,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Was not wired.

671
00:42:58,646 --> 00:43:02,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information for you, 5 High Street actually was wired.

672
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Was wired.

673
00:43:03,391 --> 00:43:05,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Was wired with both Verizon and Comcast.

674
00:43:05,894 --> 00:43:06,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Verizon came in after.

675
00:43:06,495 --> 00:43:07,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So your information is inaccurate.

676
00:43:07,896 --> 00:43:08,377
[SPEAKER_08]: No it isn't.

677
00:43:08,457 --> 00:43:09,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I said back then.

678
00:43:10,278 --> 00:43:11,438
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned High Street.

679
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:12,219
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I said.

680
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:13,559
[SPEAKER_08]: That side of High Street.

681
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:14,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the other side of High Street.

682
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:15,039
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

683
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you weren't specific.

684
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,740
[SPEAKER_07]: You said High Street.

685
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

686
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Five High Streets.

687
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:28,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Bottom line is you're wasting taxpayers' money, ratepayers' money by being in a place, you're not broadcasting, there's nothing going on over there, you're paying a station manager and one other person for nothing.

688
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:32,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Another in LRC, Councilor Penta, there's nothing going on over there.

689
00:43:32,344 --> 00:43:33,545
[SPEAKER_07]: There is nothing going on for him.

690
00:43:33,565 --> 00:43:34,545
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing going on over there.

691
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:34,925
[SPEAKER_07]: There isn't.

692
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:37,086
[SPEAKER_08]: We are in the middle of construction.

693
00:43:37,606 --> 00:43:39,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Our walls are pretty much up.

694
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:40,568
[SPEAKER_08]: We're waiting for the electrician.

695
00:43:41,048 --> 00:43:46,912
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting some wiring done so that we can wire up cameras, outfit our control room and et cetera.

696
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:49,313
[SPEAKER_08]: We have our equipment down in the basement.

697
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:57,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Mr. President, have you got any legal opinion from a city solicitor as it relates to the liability, if anything, and how this is all going to work?

698
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:59,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you discussed this with the city solicitor?

699
00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:02,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a meeting tomorrow with the mayor and the solicitor.

700
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:12,527
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, you're going ahead, making an assumption over here by going into construction and spending money, but you haven't met with the city manager, I mean, the mayor and the solicitor.

701
00:44:12,727 --> 00:44:18,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So you went ahead, ahead of time, two months ago, going in there, and now you just decide to go to the city solicitor.

702
00:44:19,508 --> 00:44:21,250
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's another inaccuracy.

703
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:22,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it inaccurate?

704
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:23,452
[SPEAKER_07]: You just said you're meeting tomorrow.

705
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:30,199
[SPEAKER_08]: We have updated City Hall periodically through this whole process, dating back since last November or December.

706
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:33,263
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Mayor has given you his blessing to put your equipment in this building.

707
00:44:33,543 --> 00:44:34,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you're saying?

708
00:44:34,224 --> 00:44:36,146
[SPEAKER_07]: That's essentially correct, yes.

709
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:41,711
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mayor of Medford said to you, Frank Palleri, Board of Directors at Channel 3, you can put your

710
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:46,127
[SPEAKER_07]: your equipment here and broadcast from here to that studio.

711
00:44:46,247 --> 00:44:49,968
[SPEAKER_08]: He said that to the Tim Kelly Comcast representative.

712
00:44:50,128 --> 00:44:50,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes he did.

713
00:44:51,269 --> 00:44:53,790
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Verizon also knows that also.

714
00:44:54,230 --> 00:45:04,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're working again, before I was interrupted, we're working with Comcast and Verizon to go ahead and find out what our capabilities will be at 32 Riverside Ave.

715
00:45:04,595 --> 00:45:13,961
[SPEAKER_08]: and to go ahead and give the same services, hopefully, that we've been giving the community and our members for well over 25 years.

716
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:15,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of further information, Mr. President.

717
00:45:17,403 --> 00:45:18,964
[SPEAKER_07]: You just used the word, hopefully.

718
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:22,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Give the same services, hopefully.

719
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:23,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

720
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:25,720
[SPEAKER_07]: The word hopefully should never have even been used.

721
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,401
[SPEAKER_07]: It should have been able to say, to provide the same services, period.

722
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:30,802
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know what we're going to be able to offer exactly.

723
00:45:30,882 --> 00:45:32,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe things will change a little bit.

724
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:34,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe things have to be tweaked.

725
00:45:34,244 --> 00:45:34,764
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know.

726
00:45:34,824 --> 00:45:41,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Until we get everything built, until we get the internet connection between here and there, we don't know what our capabilities will be.

727
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,028
[SPEAKER_07]: But to get here and there, you keep saying here and there.

728
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:45,870
[SPEAKER_07]: City Hall is supposed to be a part of this.

729
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you controlling where we actually go in City Hall?

730
00:45:48,773 --> 00:45:49,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you're saying?

731
00:45:49,673 --> 00:45:49,874
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

732
00:45:49,894 --> 00:45:52,156
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's you and not the licensing and the issuing?

733
00:45:52,556 --> 00:45:57,060
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just think there's a liability issue here and I think there's an issue that the city needs to address.

734
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think you should ask the city solicitor.

735
00:45:59,122 --> 00:45:59,462
[SPEAKER_08]: We are.

736
00:45:59,682 --> 00:45:59,903
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

737
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,004
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the reason why we're having this discussion tonight.

738
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:02,524
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

739
00:46:02,945 --> 00:46:04,546
[SPEAKER_08]: You and I both know that's not the case.

740
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:05,847
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the resolution say?

741
00:46:05,947 --> 00:46:06,948
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's not the case.

742
00:46:07,248 --> 00:46:08,168
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an election year, Councilor Panto.

743
00:46:08,188 --> 00:46:09,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't tell me what I don't know.

744
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:09,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't tell me what I know.

745
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,651
[SPEAKER_08]: In your grandstanding, this is what you do.

746
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:12,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Grandstanding?

747
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:12,772
[SPEAKER_06]: This is you.

748
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:13,512
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what you do.

749
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:14,813
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what you do.

750
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:19,696
[SPEAKER_06]: You coming up here and making a big example of what?

751
00:46:19,716 --> 00:46:20,157
[SPEAKER_06]: The bottom line.

752
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me go ahead and give a step.

753
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:21,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

754
00:46:21,898 --> 00:46:27,122
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now, the capabilities we have is we're in the process of building.

755
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:29,751
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the process of putting everything together.

756
00:46:29,771 --> 00:46:31,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of further information, Mr. President.

757
00:46:31,134 --> 00:46:32,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Pentham.

758
00:46:32,717 --> 00:46:35,443
[SPEAKER_07]: You keep saying you're in the process of building what?

759
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:38,128
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have the ability to transmit out of there.

760
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:39,250
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you building?

761
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:43,536
[SPEAKER_08]: That still doesn't mean we can't go over the station, Councilor Penton.

762
00:46:43,556 --> 00:46:45,077
[SPEAKER_08]: You're sadly mistaken.

763
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:46,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me how you're going to do it.

764
00:46:46,338 --> 00:46:47,819
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can't transmit from the internet.

765
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know that KISS 108 doesn't transmit out of Medford?

766
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care about KISS 108.

767
00:46:52,582 --> 00:46:53,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know that?

768
00:46:53,503 --> 00:46:55,044
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you think that's a vacant building?

769
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:56,305
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care about that.

770
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:59,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I care about- How do you think they transmit over- Keep your voice down, please.

771
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:02,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I care about Channel 3 and the subscribers paying for the money.

772
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:02,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Calm down.

773
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:04,070
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not talking about KISS 103.

774
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,811
[SPEAKER_03]: He's ignorant.

775
00:47:06,432 --> 00:47:07,492
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not ignorant.

776
00:47:07,552 --> 00:47:09,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, there's not going to be any-

777
00:47:10,512 --> 00:47:12,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

778
00:47:13,933 --> 00:47:15,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep the invectives to yourself.

779
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:17,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay in your subject matter, please.

780
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:21,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, could you ask if the attorney can finish my status?

781
00:47:22,637 --> 00:47:25,518
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be nice, because I think you probably have other things that you'd like to get to.

782
00:47:25,538 --> 00:47:26,699
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, wrap it up, go ahead.

783
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,219
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, great.

784
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:29,020
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're in the process of building.

785
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we do have some challenges.

786
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:33,181
[SPEAKER_08]: We had challenges at 5 High Street.

787
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:34,822
[SPEAKER_08]: We had challenges at Canal Street.

788
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:36,523
[SPEAKER_08]: We have challenges.

789
00:47:37,183 --> 00:47:39,084
[SPEAKER_08]: The board of directors is very confident.

790
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:48,799
[SPEAKER_08]: that we will be up and running, hopefully with the exact same services that we've always gone ahead and had our members use.

791
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,162
[SPEAKER_08]: We may have to do a little tweaking.

792
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:59,670
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not sure exactly what the capabilities are until we actually build out the physical site of TV3.

793
00:48:00,451 --> 00:48:02,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't put a timetable on it.

794
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,511
[SPEAKER_08]: We're waiting for the electrician.

795
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:08,053
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do some low power wiring.

796
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:17,540
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to talk to City Hall, the mayor, to try to get Comcast and Verizon synced up so that we can go ahead and do some testing.

797
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,583
[SPEAKER_08]: So just like Bill Belichick does, he will not put a timetable on an injury.

798
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:30,629
[SPEAKER_08]: We cannot put a timetable on when we're going to be up and running and when we're going to know our full capabilities.

799
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:32,730
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think at

800
00:48:33,297 --> 00:48:36,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So in a matter of weeks, I don't know how many weeks it'll be.

801
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:47,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be here again to give you some information as far as when our grand reopening will be and the full capabilities at that particular point in time.

802
00:48:48,361 --> 00:48:49,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of further point of further information.

803
00:48:51,302 --> 00:49:01,865
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you're going to have this ability to come into this building because your equipment is here, what do you expect the city to do if you have to come in here

804
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:03,376
[SPEAKER_07]: and the building is closed.

805
00:49:04,517 --> 00:49:06,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you expect to get keys to the city?

806
00:49:06,258 --> 00:49:08,219
[SPEAKER_08]: You expect- I've already had that conversation.

807
00:49:08,259 --> 00:49:10,741
[SPEAKER_08]: We will not have after hour access.

808
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:18,607
[SPEAKER_08]: We will have during the business day access, but we're going to do it remotely, just like KISS 108 does, do as much as they can remotely.

809
00:49:19,427 --> 00:49:28,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to say that there won't be times when there'll be an emergency situation where maybe the power went out, something happened to the equipment so that we have to call

810
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:38,827
[SPEAKER_08]: and gain access within a short period of time, but otherwise we'll have planned maintenance, whether that be weekly, monthly, quarterly, I don't know.

811
00:49:38,867 --> 00:49:46,994
[SPEAKER_08]: That's another thing that I really can't tell you right now because we've never done a remote access like this before.

812
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:55,701
[SPEAKER_07]: City Hall closes at 12.30 on a Friday, you have Monday through Friday, so if God forbid something had happened, you'd be down all weekend, whereas if you were in a location,

813
00:49:56,087 --> 00:49:59,355
[SPEAKER_07]: where all your equipment was there, somebody could get in, it could be serviced within an hour.

814
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this does not make any sense.

815
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:03,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Staying in a place.

816
00:50:03,706 --> 00:50:06,127
[SPEAKER_07]: staying in a place that does not give you access.

817
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:07,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to do a habit.

818
00:50:07,868 --> 00:50:09,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's the opinion.

819
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have some space in your basement we could rent?

820
00:50:12,031 --> 00:50:13,832
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're being ridiculous.

821
00:50:14,492 --> 00:50:15,593
[SPEAKER_07]: You went to 5 High Street.

822
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:18,074
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't have to get another place at 5 High Street.

823
00:50:18,094 --> 00:50:19,915
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't have to get another place at Canal Street.

824
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,816
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't have to get another place at the high school.

825
00:50:22,016 --> 00:50:22,817
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the only one.

826
00:50:23,017 --> 00:50:23,877
[SPEAKER_07]: This is your fourth move.

827
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:26,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the fourth move, you need another place to put your equipment.

828
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:27,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that bother you?

829
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it really bothers me.

830
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does that bother you, Councilor?

831
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:31,202
[SPEAKER_07]: It bothers me because it doesn't belong here.

832
00:50:31,222 --> 00:50:33,984
[SPEAKER_07]: It belongs in the place that you're renting, that you're taking the money.

833
00:50:34,004 --> 00:50:34,665
[SPEAKER_07]: You took the money.

834
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:39,269
[SPEAKER_07]: You took the money from the ratepayers of this community to have a public access channel.

835
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:43,252
[SPEAKER_08]: When we went from Canal Street while we were homeless,

836
00:50:43,812 --> 00:50:45,713
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to buy the Swan School.

837
00:50:45,753 --> 00:50:46,873
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember that, Councilor Pinto?

838
00:50:46,893 --> 00:50:47,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember it.

839
00:50:47,553 --> 00:50:49,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you voted no on that, if you remember correctly.

840
00:50:49,234 --> 00:50:49,514
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

841
00:50:49,534 --> 00:50:50,314
[SPEAKER_07]: The vote was four to three.

842
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:50,614
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?

843
00:50:50,854 --> 00:50:53,095
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have passed that so we had a permanent home.

844
00:50:53,155 --> 00:51:02,057
[SPEAKER_08]: However, let me say, we were housed in Billy Timmons' office for, I want to say, about two and a half years.

845
00:51:02,497 --> 00:51:08,359
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is precedent for us broadcasting out of City Hall.

846
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:10,880
[SPEAKER_08]: We have done it before.

847
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:17,537
[SPEAKER_08]: We are in communications, again, with Comcast, with Verizon, and the mayor's office.

848
00:51:17,837 --> 00:51:18,078
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

849
00:51:18,138 --> 00:51:19,498
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just going to keep repeating the same thing.

850
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:20,599
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to go to another question.

851
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:23,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Your station manager last week said he has a budget of $100,000.

852
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:26,803
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a separate budget that's doing all that work down there.

853
00:51:27,243 --> 00:51:28,103
[SPEAKER_07]: How much is that budget?

854
00:51:28,624 --> 00:51:30,385
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that costing?

855
00:51:30,405 --> 00:51:30,385
$200,000.

856
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

857
00:51:31,665 --> 00:51:33,246
[SPEAKER_07]: What does that cost?

858
00:51:33,266 --> 00:51:36,488
[SPEAKER_08]: $200,000 is slightly more than $200,000 is our overall budget.

859
00:51:36,548 --> 00:51:40,891
[SPEAKER_08]: That's typically what we estimated and what we got last year.

860
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:42,030
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

861
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:44,092
[SPEAKER_07]: He indicated that there's two separate budgets.

862
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:48,356
[SPEAKER_07]: One is an operating budget, one's a- Well, we have an operating budget and a capital budget, sure.

863
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:50,718
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's paying for that, operating or capital?

864
00:51:52,177 --> 00:51:56,520
[SPEAKER_08]: That's that probably capital and how much I I don't know.

865
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,482
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a budget We don't know what this is gonna cost right now.

866
00:51:59,502 --> 00:52:14,112
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know if we have to Pay Verizon for any hookups Comcast because they're very easy to work with they've gone ahead and they are paying for all the hookups They're not charging TV 3 anything.

867
00:52:14,652 --> 00:52:17,154
[SPEAKER_08]: So Verizon, I I don't know.

868
00:52:17,454 --> 00:52:21,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I say, I'm in talks with Verizon I don't know what the ultimate cost will be

869
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:26,180
[SPEAKER_08]: But whatever the cost is, if we have to pay, it'll come out of capital budget.

870
00:52:27,241 --> 00:52:30,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're saying a combination of your operating capital budget is $200,000 a year?

871
00:52:31,344 --> 00:52:33,265
[SPEAKER_08]: We get $200,000 a year.

872
00:52:33,305 --> 00:52:39,409
[SPEAKER_08]: How we divvy it up and what bucket we put in, that is up to our accountant and our board of directors.

873
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:41,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Last question, Mr. President.

874
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:45,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week, because your station manager couldn't answer the question, so maybe you can answer it.

875
00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:47,335
[SPEAKER_07]: When's the last time you've been audited?

876
00:52:48,518 --> 00:52:50,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you give him an opportunity to answer the question last night?

877
00:52:51,019 --> 00:52:51,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did.

878
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:52,059
[SPEAKER_07]: He said he didn't know.

879
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,761
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not an audit.

880
00:52:55,981 --> 00:52:57,561
[SPEAKER_07]: You filed your report to the state.

881
00:52:57,621 --> 00:52:58,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about an audit.

882
00:52:58,622 --> 00:53:02,143
[SPEAKER_08]: We had an audit, I want to say,

883
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:05,166
[SPEAKER_08]: 2008 or so.

884
00:53:05,646 --> 00:53:07,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you have an annual audit?

885
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:09,230
[SPEAKER_08]: An annual audit?

886
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:09,670
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we don't.

887
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:11,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Every three, four years or so.

888
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:13,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you have an annual audit?

889
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:13,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

890
00:53:14,154 --> 00:53:15,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not an accountant.

891
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:16,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a CPA.

892
00:53:16,356 --> 00:53:17,617
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the station manager.

893
00:53:17,677 --> 00:53:19,779
[SPEAKER_07]: You have your money managers over there.

894
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:20,540
[SPEAKER_07]: They should know.

895
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not the station manager, sir.

896
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,202
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you?

897
00:53:23,222 --> 00:53:24,043
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the president?

898
00:53:24,063 --> 00:53:24,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the president of the corporation.

899
00:53:25,024 --> 00:53:26,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And how long have you been there, Frank?

900
00:53:26,665 --> 00:53:28,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been affiliated with TV3 since 1986.

901
00:53:28,608 --> 00:53:35,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Well then, from 1987 to this particular time, you should have a pretty good idea how a station runs and what they're responsible for and what to do.

902
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President... Oh, I do.

903
00:53:37,962 --> 00:53:40,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot better idea than you and some other people in this room.

904
00:53:40,706 --> 00:53:41,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I just asked you the question then.

905
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:45,072
[SPEAKER_07]: The last time you think was three to four years ago.

906
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:46,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Three to four years ago, yeah.

907
00:53:47,194 --> 00:53:48,595
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not an answer in your world?

908
00:53:48,635 --> 00:53:49,897
[SPEAKER_08]: No, why don't you have an audit every year?

909
00:53:50,257 --> 00:53:51,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Like every other business has.

910
00:53:51,338 --> 00:53:51,759
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we don't.

911
00:53:51,779 --> 00:53:53,440
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an audit every three to four years.

912
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:53,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

913
00:53:54,081 --> 00:53:56,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, after this bill though, we're going to have another audit.

914
00:53:56,884 --> 00:53:58,786
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will have an audit sometime in 2013.

915
00:53:59,927 --> 00:54:02,470
[SPEAKER_07]: So you didn't adhere to Judge Jackson's report and her findings.

916
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently you didn't follow her recommendations.

917
00:54:05,121 --> 00:54:08,983
[SPEAKER_08]: We followed some recommendations of Melanson and Heath.

918
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:18,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be perfectly honest with you, that was something that we looked at, and I can't honestly say it was so long ago, what we followed and what we didn't follow of Judge Jackson.

919
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:20,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's a very interesting comment to make.

920
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:21,670
[SPEAKER_07]: The city pays $15,000.

921
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:30,615
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing I can tell you, Councilor Penter, is Judge Jackson didn't give us an opportunity to go ahead and ask questions of the people hurling car bombs at us.

922
00:54:31,536 --> 00:54:36,739
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the thing I will tell you about Judge Jackson in that whole kangaroo court.

923
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:41,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're saying that city solicitor Rumley, he hurled car bombs at you too?

924
00:54:42,002 --> 00:54:43,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you're saying?

925
00:54:43,803 --> 00:54:44,323
[SPEAKER_07]: No comment.

926
00:54:44,524 --> 00:54:45,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no comment.

927
00:54:45,224 --> 00:54:45,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so, huh?

928
00:54:46,465 --> 00:54:46,725
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

929
00:54:47,405 --> 00:54:48,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

930
00:54:48,066 --> 00:54:48,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

931
00:54:49,130 --> 00:55:00,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Frank, I don't have the history that these other people have with TV3, but the bottom line is you have an audience in the city that's looking for TV3.

932
00:55:00,115 --> 00:55:01,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, yeah.

933
00:55:02,116 --> 00:55:09,139
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sure all of us here get calls every day, we see people in the street, and they ask us, where is TV3?

934
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:09,859
[SPEAKER_16]: What's happening with it?

935
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,160
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're not getting

936
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,922
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no communication whether through via the newspaper or.

937
00:55:16,163 --> 00:55:17,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello, you see this?

938
00:55:18,945 --> 00:55:20,266
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an iPhone.

939
00:55:20,447 --> 00:55:21,888
[SPEAKER_08]: You have my phone number.

940
00:55:21,908 --> 00:55:23,970
[SPEAKER_16]: We've talked in the past.

941
00:55:26,852 --> 00:55:32,237
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm saying that the people of this community, they call us, they ask us what's happening.

942
00:55:33,438 --> 00:55:37,001
[SPEAKER_16]: You have an audience in this community that is looking for your programming.

943
00:55:37,302 --> 00:55:37,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

944
00:55:38,999 --> 00:55:39,820
[SPEAKER_16]: And they see us in the streets.

945
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,881
[SPEAKER_16]: They see us in the supermarket.

946
00:55:41,282 --> 00:55:42,984
[SPEAKER_16]: They ask us, what's happening there?

947
00:55:43,225 --> 00:55:43,645
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't know.

948
00:55:43,685 --> 00:55:46,089
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's hard for us to give them an answer.

949
00:55:46,448 --> 00:55:49,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe you guys should communicate via the newspaper.

950
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:54,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Can't you guys go on the government channel?

951
00:55:54,715 --> 00:55:59,759
[SPEAKER_08]: What we have, Councilor, is we do have a status up on our website and Facebook page.

952
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:04,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Of all these people are seniors, I don't know how computer literate they are.

953
00:56:04,183 --> 00:56:04,643
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fair.

954
00:56:06,004 --> 00:56:11,269
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a good part of your audience is the senior crowd, and they look forward to your stuff.

955
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:13,203
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a point well taken.

956
00:56:13,323 --> 00:56:15,444
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, update them in the newspaper.

957
00:56:16,004 --> 00:56:17,164
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, go on the government channel.

958
00:56:17,764 --> 00:56:28,627
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe, you know, I'm sure you have some, you know, the mayor would give you access to the channel that the council is broadcast on, or the high school users, and let the people know where you are and what's going on.

959
00:56:28,727 --> 00:56:30,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Council, point well taken.

960
00:56:31,108 --> 00:56:37,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go ahead and, as well as Facebook and our website, we'll go ahead and we'll try to get the word out.

961
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:39,610
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of the seniors don't, aren't computer literate.

962
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:41,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, you're absolutely right.

963
00:56:42,113 --> 00:56:54,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I would urge everyone in this room, if you want us up to the minute status, you want to take a walk over at our new location, Riverside Ave, to drop a dime.

964
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,454
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd be more than happy to go ahead and take you through.

965
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,131
[SPEAKER_08]: and show you everything.

966
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:04,873
[SPEAKER_08]: The building commission has been there, ADA has been involved and all that.

967
00:57:05,273 --> 00:57:08,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we have people, but we lock the door.

968
00:57:09,035 --> 00:57:10,516
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot of equipment in there.

969
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:18,679
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't let anybody walk in there, especially Councilor Penta, but we don't let anyone just walk in there because we have so much equipment.

970
00:57:19,299 --> 00:57:20,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of personal privilege, Councilor Penta.

971
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,541
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that remark supposed to mean?

972
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:24,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it was just a little fun.

973
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,001
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

974
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,021
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that supposed to mean?

975
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:26,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Lighten up, dear boy.

976
00:57:27,002 --> 00:57:28,122
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not going to lighten up.

977
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:29,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm serious about that.

978
00:57:29,862 --> 00:57:31,322
[SPEAKER_07]: You think I'm going to go in there and take your equipment?

979
00:57:31,342 --> 00:57:35,563
[SPEAKER_08]: After all the accusations you hurled at our station manager last week, you take offense?

980
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:36,383
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?

981
00:57:36,443 --> 00:57:37,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hurl any accusations.

982
00:57:37,243 --> 00:57:37,963
[SPEAKER_07]: You would take offense to that?

983
00:57:38,144 --> 00:57:38,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hurl any.

984
00:57:38,644 --> 00:57:39,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I just made comments.

985
00:57:39,564 --> 00:57:40,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hurl anything.

986
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:43,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't point the finger at anyone that was doing anything.

987
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:43,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked questions.

988
00:57:43,945 --> 00:57:44,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that right?

989
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:45,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's right.

990
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:45,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that right?

991
00:57:45,665 --> 00:57:45,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

992
00:57:46,165 --> 00:57:47,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what about this missing money?

993
00:57:48,045 --> 00:57:48,805
[SPEAKER_07]: You tell me about it.

994
00:57:49,445 --> 00:57:49,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't write it.

995
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:50,346
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no money missing.

996
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:51,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't write it in the report.

997
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Your facts are wrong.

998
00:57:52,526 --> 00:57:54,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then, Senator Heath, read its report.

999
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:54,992
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're wrong.

1000
00:57:55,854 --> 00:57:57,238
[SPEAKER_08]: You should reread that, Councilor.

1001
00:57:58,482 --> 00:58:08,750
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after you reread it, and you see that the city owes TV3 that money, I would expect you to come back here, and I would like for you to say, you know what?

1002
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:09,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I was inaccurate.

1003
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:11,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wrong.

1004
00:58:11,212 --> 00:58:12,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Frank Leary was right.

1005
00:58:12,192 --> 00:58:14,534
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's the case, Frank, I would be more than happy to do it.

1006
00:58:14,554 --> 00:58:20,058
[SPEAKER_07]: But when your money managers say that you people keep sloppy bookkeeping records, I have to find out.

1007
00:58:20,078 --> 00:58:20,258
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1008
00:58:20,278 --> 00:58:21,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Vice President Del Russo.

1009
00:58:21,579 --> 00:58:22,760
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a thing of the past.

1010
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, point of information.

1011
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:24,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1012
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:29,184
[SPEAKER_09]: still the contracted auditor for the City of Medford.

1013
00:58:29,684 --> 00:58:30,244
[SPEAKER_03]: City of Medford.

1014
00:58:30,664 --> 00:58:30,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1015
00:58:30,864 --> 00:58:31,325
[SPEAKER_03]: City of Medford.

1016
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:32,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1017
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:33,525
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1018
00:58:35,586 --> 00:58:36,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Time's up.

1019
00:58:36,427 --> 00:58:36,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1020
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:37,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1021
00:58:37,667 --> 00:58:39,268
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1022
00:58:39,288 --> 00:58:40,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a motion?

1023
00:58:41,689 --> 00:58:42,089
[SPEAKER_03]: One quick.

1024
00:58:42,109 --> 00:58:46,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you move suspension.

1025
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:49,112
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1026
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:49,932
[SPEAKER_01]: One minute.

1027
00:58:50,313 --> 00:58:53,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say that he's misrepresenting, Mr. Pleary is misrepresenting

1028
00:58:54,175 --> 00:58:59,296
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that MedFed is not interconnected on some level with TV3.

1029
00:58:59,356 --> 00:59:03,497
[SPEAKER_01]: The Judge Jackson report was paid for by MedFed taxpayer money.

1030
00:59:04,098 --> 00:59:09,839
[SPEAKER_01]: MedFed oversees, MedFed's mayor, who is paid by the taxpayer, oversees TV3.

1031
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:11,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to clarify that, thank you.

1032
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,921
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, on the motion of Council Penta, it's his resolution.

1033
00:59:17,081 --> 00:59:20,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if we can get some requests from the city solicitor.

1034
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:34,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Vacation is on the access to TV, three personnel, the city hall, liability issues, supervision, access to keys, equipment, storage, you know, for the access here at city hall and building access to access to TV on that motion.

1035
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:35,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

1036
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, Ron Delusha, um, Coolidge road.

1037
00:59:37,961 --> 00:59:39,383
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the vice president of TV three.

1038
00:59:40,103 --> 00:59:42,865
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I just, uh, came back from vacation.

1039
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:45,608
[SPEAKER_15]: I turned on the TV looking for the best, uh,

1040
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:50,792
[SPEAKER_15]: entertainment on television, and I got the Council meeting, so I drove right down.

1041
00:59:50,812 --> 00:59:52,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope I'm not going to be redundant.

1042
00:59:52,494 --> 00:59:58,859
[SPEAKER_15]: But, Counsel Penter, through the Chair, if I may, you've twice mentioned the money managers and we keep sloppy bookkeeping.

1043
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,582
[SPEAKER_15]: That comment came from me, and you're not accurate with your comment.

1044
01:00:05,164 --> 01:00:10,988
[SPEAKER_15]: After the audit, they found absolutely nothing wrong.

1045
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:16,453
[SPEAKER_15]: The audit was triggered by comments by a couple of people, and, of course,

1046
01:00:17,805 --> 01:00:31,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of you who have not been friends with TV3 were just dying to find something wrong with TV3, especially if it was something financial, because that would really be great, you know, for the people who don't like TV3.

1047
01:00:32,273 --> 01:00:37,436
[SPEAKER_15]: They found nothing wrong except some of the records, they weren't the way that they wanted them.

1048
01:00:37,476 --> 01:00:43,339
[SPEAKER_15]: And my comment was a joke, and I said, we were guilty of nothing except maybe we were sloppy.

1049
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,380
[SPEAKER_15]: That wasn't sloppy bookkeeping.

1050
01:00:48,365 --> 01:00:50,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't believe so.

1051
01:00:53,671 --> 01:00:53,971
[SPEAKER_15]: I will.

1052
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:58,676
[SPEAKER_15]: And unlike some people, if I'm wrong, I'll say, hey, I'm wrong.

1053
01:00:59,257 --> 01:01:07,125
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think one of the things that's been said a couple of times, and it's alluded to, that there's a financial problem with TV3.

1054
01:01:07,926 --> 01:01:10,428
[SPEAKER_15]: And the auditors went through the books.

1055
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:14,209
[SPEAKER_15]: completely except for a few pages of a few things.

1056
01:01:14,229 --> 01:01:18,671
[SPEAKER_15]: They didn't get it on time, but then got afterwards and there was nothing wrong.

1057
01:01:18,711 --> 01:01:19,851
[SPEAKER_15]: And they went back for years.

1058
01:01:20,271 --> 01:01:23,192
[SPEAKER_15]: And as far as your question as to why don't we get audited every year?

1059
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:25,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause we don't have $15,000 a year to pay for an audit.

1060
01:01:26,514 --> 01:01:31,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Unlike most of the stations in the vicinity, they get an awful lot of money from the rate payers.

1061
01:01:31,235 --> 01:01:32,636
[SPEAKER_15]: We get a small portion of it.

1062
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:38,278
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that small portion, the staff and the members,

1063
01:01:38,769 --> 01:01:44,413
[SPEAKER_15]: have done a great job in producing programs for TV3 and getting recognition countrywide.

1064
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:49,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, with... Point of information, Councilor Penta.

1065
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:55,360
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys get $200,000 a year from the subscribers of this community.

1066
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:55,660
[SPEAKER_07]: $200,000 a year.

1067
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,803
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're telling me you cannot afford to have an annual audit on your books?

1068
01:02:00,864 --> 01:02:01,624
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, yeah.

1069
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:04,046
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't afford $15,000 for an audit, yeah.

1070
01:02:04,586 --> 01:02:04,926
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

1071
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:08,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we pay rent, we pay salaries.

1072
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:09,592
[SPEAKER_15]: We pay fees.

1073
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:14,796
[SPEAKER_15]: It takes a lot of money, Mr. Penter, and you're more than welcome to come down and take a look.

1074
01:02:14,956 --> 01:02:18,619
[SPEAKER_15]: How come in Somerville— Well, because they get more than $200,000.

1075
01:02:18,919 --> 01:02:19,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they do more, too.

1076
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,882
[SPEAKER_15]: They get a hell of a lot more than $200,000.

1077
01:02:21,962 --> 01:02:22,862
[SPEAKER_07]: And they do more, too.

1078
01:02:22,922 --> 01:02:28,247
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a matter of fact, they go before the legislative body almost quarterly to explain what they do.

1079
01:02:28,767 --> 01:02:32,248
[SPEAKER_07]: the programs that they're presenting, and they tell them about their income levels.

1080
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:35,408
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's a great thing for them, because their legislative body controls them.

1081
01:02:35,428 --> 01:02:36,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you guys should do that.

1082
01:02:36,108 --> 01:02:39,549
[SPEAKER_15]: But in this city, the mayor controls it, Mr. Penta.

1083
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:42,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Not you, not the counselor, the mayor.

1084
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:49,091
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you want questions answered, why don't you have the courage to ask the mayor?

1085
01:02:49,151 --> 01:02:50,531
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, and he hasn't responded.

1086
01:02:50,551 --> 01:02:51,911
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we're discussing it right here.

1087
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:55,612
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can't get it from the proper authority, so you go down the line and ask someone else?

1088
01:02:56,092 --> 01:02:56,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Pardon me?

1089
01:02:56,952 --> 01:02:58,953
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't get it from the proper authorities?

1090
01:02:58,973 --> 01:02:59,754
[SPEAKER_15]: You just ask anybody?

1091
01:02:59,774 --> 01:03:01,254
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not the only proper authority.

1092
01:03:01,294 --> 01:03:05,957
[SPEAKER_07]: We represent the people of this community, and we represent cable TV subscribers.

1093
01:03:06,237 --> 01:03:09,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you folks want to come here and give your sales pitch, you go right ahead.

1094
01:03:09,879 --> 01:03:11,420
[SPEAKER_07]: They can hear you, and they can hear any one of us.

1095
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,301
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see it as a sales pitch, Mr. Penter.

1096
01:03:13,341 --> 01:03:15,562
[SPEAKER_15]: I see it as trying to explain some things.

1097
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:24,020
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wish you would appreciate, if you'd look at it that way, and not be so hostile to every single thing that's said.

1098
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:24,881
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not hostile.

1099
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:31,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I can tell by the comments that you say, the terminology that you're using, I know exactly where you're getting your information.

1100
01:03:31,645 --> 01:03:33,426
[SPEAKER_15]: And that information is usually wrong.

1101
01:03:33,746 --> 01:03:35,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Where am I getting my information?

1102
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:35,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me.

1103
01:03:36,248 --> 01:03:36,648
[SPEAKER_15]: That's OK, Mr. Penta.

1104
01:03:36,668 --> 01:03:36,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me.

1105
01:03:36,948 --> 01:03:37,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute.

1106
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:39,049
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you just made a comment.

1107
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:40,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did, Mr. Penta.

1108
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:42,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Who am I getting and where am I getting my information from?

1109
01:03:42,972 --> 01:03:44,613
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't think I have the ability to do this on my own?

1110
01:03:44,633 --> 01:03:45,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you're trying to say?

1111
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:48,173
[SPEAKER_07]: You think I'm somebody else's mouthpiece?

1112
01:03:48,193 --> 01:03:53,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I would rather not answer that question, Mr. Penta, because I would have to say that you can't forget it right.

1113
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to stand here and listen to that nonsense.

1114
01:03:56,006 --> 01:03:56,187
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1115
01:03:58,132 --> 01:04:02,596
[SPEAKER_15]: My point being coming up here, Mr. President.

1116
01:04:02,616 --> 01:04:07,000
[SPEAKER_15]: My point was that the audit found absolutely nothing wrong.

1117
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,702
[SPEAKER_15]: There was no financial shenanigans going on.

1118
01:04:10,062 --> 01:04:13,585
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't like the fact that it gets alluded to and it gets lost over the course of years.

1119
01:04:13,745 --> 01:04:14,946
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why we came up.

1120
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:15,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1121
01:04:16,047 --> 01:04:16,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1122
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:23,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, can I just correct Councilor Pinto and just give him a little information?

1123
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:30,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Somerville, Cambridge, and Malden all handle all three peg access stations.

1124
01:04:31,262 --> 01:04:38,707
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why Somerville goes ahead and comes to the city council or whatever form of government that they have.

1125
01:04:39,127 --> 01:04:43,910
[SPEAKER_08]: In the event that we were in control of all three, I'm sure we would do the same thing.

1126
01:04:44,491 --> 01:04:45,772
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the major distinction.

1127
01:04:46,172 --> 01:04:51,195
[SPEAKER_08]: And Somerville gets at least $400,000, and Cambridge gets approximately $600,000.

1128
01:04:55,592 --> 01:05:00,955
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, maybe they do a lot more from your perspective.

1129
01:05:01,416 --> 01:05:07,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just say, they have not won the best station in the country two out of the last four years.

1130
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:12,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have with our level of budget, which is so far below them.

1131
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:16,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So clearly, somebody thinks we're doing something right and we're doing a good job.

1132
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,989
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you.

1133
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:18,970
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Councilor Panta.

1134
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:19,790
[SPEAKER_07]: One last question.

1135
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:23,631
[SPEAKER_07]: You may have won the award, but so didn't 10 other communities win the award, all right?

1136
01:05:23,851 --> 01:05:25,231
[SPEAKER_07]: So you weren't the only community.

1137
01:05:25,252 --> 01:05:29,153
[SPEAKER_07]: We won the National Excellence Award.

1138
01:05:30,173 --> 01:05:36,215
[SPEAKER_08]: There's only one access station in the country that gets that.

1139
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:36,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

1140
01:05:36,795 --> 01:05:42,477
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, on the motion of Councilor Panta, there's no point of information for you.

1141
01:05:43,803 --> 01:05:44,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course not, I have no standing.

1142
01:05:44,784 --> 01:05:46,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Counsel is that point of information, okay?

1143
01:05:46,565 --> 01:05:47,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1144
01:05:47,926 --> 01:05:51,508
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to clarify, the Melanson and Heath audit was dragged on and on and on.

1145
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:58,252
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor wanted it at a certain point in time and Judge Jackson was really looking for the audit in a certain amount of time.

1146
01:05:58,773 --> 01:06:01,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford Community Cablevision did not comply and get the papers there.

1147
01:06:02,937 --> 01:06:10,360
[SPEAKER_12]: When you read, and I hope you all read, the Judge Jackson report in the Melanson and Heath audit, the auditors could not draw a conclusion.

1148
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,081
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't say anything pro or con.

1149
01:06:12,121 --> 01:06:17,083
[SPEAKER_12]: So when this station comes up here and tells you they have a clean bill of health, that is certainly not the answer.

1150
01:06:17,523 --> 01:06:22,045
[SPEAKER_12]: There's that $5,000 counselor Penta talked about on an ATM card.

1151
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:24,006
[SPEAKER_12]: $500 was accounted for.

1152
01:06:24,286 --> 01:06:24,626
[SPEAKER_12]: $4,500 wasn't.

1153
01:06:24,946 --> 01:06:30,488
[SPEAKER_12]: I've handed the counsel information that went to the district attorney's office today to the individual I'm talking with.

1154
01:06:30,669 --> 01:06:31,689
[SPEAKER_12]: That information you have

1155
01:06:32,082 --> 01:06:33,342
[SPEAKER_12]: is also with the district attorney.

1156
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:34,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1157
01:06:35,303 --> 01:06:36,763
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, on the motion to Council Penta.

1158
01:06:38,603 --> 01:06:39,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Call the roll, Mr. Clerk.

1159
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:45,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Call the motion.

1160
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:57,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the misleading information of last Tuesday's council meeting that channel three can be broadcast from their newly rented location.

1161
01:06:57,387 --> 01:06:58,087
[SPEAKER_05]: You want the amendments.

1162
01:06:58,627 --> 01:06:59,267
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want the motion.

1163
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:00,408
[SPEAKER_05]: The amendment.

1164
01:07:02,498 --> 01:07:16,664
[SPEAKER_05]: The amendment would be, is to seek opinions from the city solicitor on the legal ramifications on the access of TV3 personnel to City Hall, what are liability issues, supervision, key equipment storage issues.

1165
01:07:19,265 --> 01:07:21,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Equipment's in this annex here.

1166
01:07:22,066 --> 01:07:22,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Call the roll.

1167
01:07:23,327 --> 01:07:24,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me?

1168
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:28,989
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an amendment to the main motion.

1169
01:07:33,755 --> 01:07:34,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you vote on the amendment.

1170
01:07:34,776 --> 01:07:35,936
[SPEAKER_03]: You vote on the amendment.

1171
01:07:37,296 --> 01:07:37,777
[SPEAKER_03]: On the amendment.

1172
01:07:38,397 --> 01:07:38,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

1173
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:43,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Call the roll.

1174
01:07:45,579 --> 01:07:46,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an amendment.

1175
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:47,920
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an amendment.

1176
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,761
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one.

1177
01:07:52,121 --> 01:07:53,382
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he read the main motion.

1178
01:07:53,882 --> 01:07:54,862
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on the calendar.

1179
01:07:56,043 --> 01:07:56,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You offer an amendment.

1180
01:07:57,711 --> 01:08:05,597
[SPEAKER_03]: You vote on the amendment if the amendment fails and the other one is just academic, unless they change parliamentary procedure.

1181
01:08:05,937 --> 01:08:06,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Call the roll.

1182
01:08:08,379 --> 01:08:09,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso?

1183
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:09,820
No.

1184
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:11,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello?

1185
01:08:12,943 --> 01:08:12,983
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1186
01:08:13,023 --> 01:08:13,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Dello Russo?

1187
01:08:13,943 --> 01:08:15,164
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1188
01:08:15,184 --> 01:08:15,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leonard Kern?

1189
01:08:15,905 --> 01:08:15,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1190
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:17,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

1191
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:17,766
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1192
01:08:18,987 --> 01:08:19,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta?

1193
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:19,908
Yes.

1194
01:08:20,869 --> 01:08:21,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice Mayor Mayorkas?

1195
01:08:21,469 --> 01:08:21,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1196
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:25,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And a vote of three in the affirmative, four in the negative.

1197
01:08:25,732 --> 01:08:26,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion fails.

1198
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:30,952
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion to council, that's on the main motion.

1199
01:08:32,193 --> 01:08:33,714
[SPEAKER_07]: On that motion, Councilor Penta.

1200
01:08:34,574 --> 01:08:39,597
[SPEAKER_07]: If I understand how the motion just did not pass, I understand that.

1201
01:08:39,757 --> 01:08:56,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question then becomes of the mayor, that the mayor should be reporting back to the council that he is allowing Channel 3, he should update this council, that he is now allowing Channel 3 to house and use this building for the purposes of supplementing

1202
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:59,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I would suggest in the budget time it must be discussed.

1203
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:01,533
[SPEAKER_03]: There must be a cost in there somewhere.

1204
01:09:02,454 --> 01:09:02,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1205
01:09:02,754 --> 01:09:03,214
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotta be.

1206
01:09:04,155 --> 01:09:04,756
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get that done.

1207
01:09:05,536 --> 01:09:05,856
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1208
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:06,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1209
01:09:07,938 --> 01:09:08,178
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1210
01:09:08,218 --> 01:09:25,711
[SPEAKER_03]: On page two, 2013 5 0 3 offered by council Penta, uh, be it resolved that the council president call for an immediate meeting, uh, with the city's chosen contractor to discuss the proposed new city, uh, the lease agreement on commercial street and the updating of the police station,

1211
01:09:26,169 --> 01:09:28,970
[SPEAKER_03]: with a cost analysis and timetable for all.

1212
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you move suspension to take Councilman O'Rourke?

1213
01:09:33,232 --> 01:09:35,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilman Lungo-Koehn's resolution with this.

1214
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:35,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's germane.

1215
01:09:36,734 --> 01:09:44,938
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, on the motion to Council Penta, a suspension to take Councilman Lungo-Koehn's resolution, which is germane to this resolution, along with the Committee of the Whole report.

1216
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:48,360
[SPEAKER_03]: 2013-5, a weight off by Councilman Lungo-Koehn.

1217
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:55,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved the council be provided with an updated bond breakdown to include all current bond on the books, which is owed,

1218
01:09:56,004 --> 01:10:12,374
[SPEAKER_03]: what is owed per year and the date each will be paid off via further resolve that a second spreadsheet be produced to include the estimated bond that will have to be taken out to build the DPW building, the updates, expansion of the police station building and the school pool.

1219
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:13,615
[SPEAKER_07]: First Councilor Penta.

1220
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:20,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I'm thankful that Councilor Lingo-Curran now has added on to the resolution in thought and in practice.

1221
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,441
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have here is a whole host of issues.

1222
01:10:24,005 --> 01:10:31,489
[SPEAKER_07]: As we had our discussion tonight relative to the pool issue, the bottom line to all of this is the mayor says everything is a priority.

1223
01:10:31,849 --> 01:10:33,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, everything cannot be a priority.

1224
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:38,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Taxpayers in this community are going to wind up paying for everything that's a priority in the mayor's mind.

1225
01:10:38,532 --> 01:10:39,512
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a police yard.

1226
01:10:39,552 --> 01:10:40,973
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a fire department.

1227
01:10:40,993 --> 01:10:41,914
[SPEAKER_07]: We have public works.

1228
01:10:42,374 --> 01:10:45,215
[SPEAKER_07]: We have whatever the heck is going on on Commercial Street.

1229
01:10:45,235 --> 01:10:46,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how much longer that's going to last.

1230
01:10:49,237 --> 01:10:51,038
[SPEAKER_07]: We still haven't even resolved the issue

1231
01:10:51,573 --> 01:10:58,888
[SPEAKER_07]: of the girls or the ladies or the women, however you want to use the terminology in the police department, you know, the locker rooms or the lack of locker rooms.

1232
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:03,488
[SPEAKER_07]: and the safety issues that need to be revolved over there.

1233
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:08,652
[SPEAKER_07]: We never even got to the point of the Water and Sewer Department after the fire in May of three years ago.

1234
01:11:08,872 --> 01:11:09,973
[SPEAKER_07]: They were supposed to get a trailer.

1235
01:11:10,013 --> 01:11:11,033
[SPEAKER_07]: They never even got a trailer.

1236
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these things go on and on.

1237
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:17,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we have a swimming pool that's now going to get us well up to almost $3,800,000.

1238
01:11:17,418 --> 01:11:19,099
[SPEAKER_07]: It started off as a $2.3 million adventure.

1239
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:20,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just don't think the taxpayers of this city

1240
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:28,999
[SPEAKER_07]: should be led to believe, oh, we can afford it, we can afford it.

1241
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:29,820
[SPEAKER_07]: What can we afford?

1242
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:35,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time you slap a dollar on the price tag of all of this stuff, somebody has to pay for it.

1243
01:11:35,943 --> 01:11:40,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there's no conversation anymore about the no-interest loans that the MWRA had.

1244
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:41,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know whatever happened to that.

1245
01:11:41,966 --> 01:11:49,330
[SPEAKER_07]: We never heard anything more about, you know, the money that was supposed to be coming forward from the billboards and all of that to appropriate this money.

1246
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:53,752
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I really think, Mr. President, before any votes take place,

1247
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:57,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Any agreements take place on any one of these issues.

1248
01:11:57,973 --> 01:12:05,859
[SPEAKER_07]: We really need to, if the mayor doesn't want to put it in some kind of an order of priority, then maybe the council should, between and amongst ourselves.

1249
01:12:05,899 --> 01:12:14,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we all feel that the public works department is more important than the pool, or maybe the police department is more important than the pool, or the pool is more important than the fire department.

1250
01:12:14,727 --> 01:12:15,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1251
01:12:15,467 --> 01:12:17,449
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's only so much money that we have to go out there.

1252
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:19,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have a budget coming up right around the corner.

1253
01:12:20,231 --> 01:12:22,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And as Councilor Lungelkorn alluded to before,

1254
01:12:22,515 --> 01:12:36,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And as Councilor Marks also alluded to, we should have these figures before this budget even comes into place so we have some kind of an idea how much this is gonna cost and where we're going with it.

1255
01:12:36,882 --> 01:12:43,566
[SPEAKER_07]: You talk to the rate payer, the taxpayer on the street, all they know is the cost of everything just keeps going up and up and up.

1256
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:45,547
[SPEAKER_07]: And the cost of government keeps going up too.

1257
01:12:46,327 --> 01:12:48,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we saw a pure example of it tonight

1258
01:12:48,686 --> 01:12:50,087
[SPEAKER_07]: on Channel 3 coming down here.

1259
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:51,908
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, it's total incompetence.

1260
01:12:51,928 --> 01:12:55,791
[SPEAKER_07]: They did not want to address or discuss the issue regarding ratepayers' money.

1261
01:12:56,111 --> 01:12:58,673
[SPEAKER_07]: At least we can discuss taxpayers' money.

1262
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:03,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And at least we have some semblance of controlling of what's going on in this city.

1263
01:13:03,597 --> 01:13:10,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, on the cable TV subscribers, why the mayor is refusing to get involved to do anything, I don't know.

1264
01:13:10,882 --> 01:13:13,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they have a tie over him over something, I don't know.

1265
01:13:13,624 --> 01:13:15,845
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's absolutely wrong as to what's going on over there.

1266
01:13:16,286 --> 01:13:18,367
[SPEAKER_07]: But more importantly, at least on this particular issue,

1267
01:13:18,683 --> 01:13:26,988
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some control over it, and we have the control of either saying yes, no, or maybe, or cut it in between, and maybe it's not as grandiose as it appears to be.

1268
01:13:27,668 --> 01:13:28,508
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1269
01:13:28,548 --> 01:13:29,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Longo-Kurin.

1270
01:13:29,789 --> 01:13:31,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Mayocko.

1271
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:34,071
[SPEAKER_00]: My issue comes just with financial.

1272
01:13:34,131 --> 01:13:38,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only we have the budget coming up, but the number of bonds that are on the books.

1273
01:13:39,813 --> 01:13:51,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, I'd like to see a breakdown of—we've got breakdowns before, but I'd like to see a breakdown of what is owed, what will be owed each year for each bond, a total of what is owed.

1274
01:13:51,602 --> 01:14:05,493
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like, for what we currently have, and then on a second spreadsheet, a breakdown of not only what is currently owed, but also an estimate on what the DPW department to rebuild is going to cost.

1275
01:14:05,553 --> 01:14:08,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like that added to the bond worksheet.

1276
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:13,774
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as we need an update on what's going on with the police department.

1277
01:14:13,854 --> 01:14:18,197
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically, you know, I believe it needs to be expanded on.

1278
01:14:18,858 --> 01:14:25,403
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think evidence being housed in a garage is sufficient, adequate, or reasonable.

1279
01:14:25,423 --> 01:14:37,852
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to expand on the police department, but we need to know what the mayor and the city administration is gonna do, whether it's, I don't think it's gonna be rebuilt, but whether it be expand,

1280
01:14:39,304 --> 01:14:44,788
[SPEAKER_00]: rework, refurbish what we need to do at the police station, I'd like that included.

1281
01:14:45,168 --> 01:15:00,679
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like, now we have a three point, I believe it's a $3.3 million bond that they want to put on the books for the pool at 3%, so that's gonna be a good amount, I'd say 80 to $100,000 a year that we're gonna have to pay back per year on the pool.

1282
01:15:06,109 --> 01:15:07,630
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd just like to see the figures.

1283
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:08,911
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we putting on the books?

1284
01:15:08,991 --> 01:15:12,914
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to have to pay back from now until the next 15 years?

1285
01:15:12,974 --> 01:15:20,140
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to evaluate that along with the next budget before we can make the decisions.

1286
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:23,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody wants to see a brand new pool, brand new locker rooms.

1287
01:15:23,563 --> 01:15:24,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of them.

1288
01:15:25,024 --> 01:15:30,388
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we have the rate payers who are basically screaming to us, what are you doing?

1289
01:15:30,448 --> 01:15:32,850
[SPEAKER_00]: How much money can you spend over a three-year period?

1290
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:35,246
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have essentials that need to get done.

1291
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:37,347
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have a DPW yard now.

1292
01:15:37,468 --> 01:15:38,588
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be rebuilt.

1293
01:15:39,089 --> 01:15:45,132
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to do what we had to do with the police station, and we have to continue to figure out what the mayor wants to do with that.

1294
01:15:46,293 --> 01:15:49,515
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to evaluate it all before we can make a recommendation.

1295
01:15:49,535 --> 01:15:59,221
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to ask for it by next Tuesday, because I know we're in line to get about $500,000 to go toward the $600,000 for the locker rooms of the pool, and time is of the essence for that.

1296
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:08,021
[SPEAKER_00]: But if so, if we could get this breakdown, hopefully within the next week, it would be appreciated.

1297
01:16:08,081 --> 01:16:18,489
[SPEAKER_00]: It would help me make a determination, um, not only for the students and those who use the pool, but for the, the community as a whole to, to move forward most appropriately.

1298
01:16:18,509 --> 01:16:20,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1299
01:16:20,531 --> 01:16:20,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice president.

1300
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:28,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, uh, Mr. President and council along the current, uh, uh, presents a, uh, a very worthwhile resolution.

1301
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,199
[SPEAKER_09]: We, uh, maybe,

1302
01:16:32,281 --> 01:16:42,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it was Mrs. Burke or in Baker, our auditor, prepared annually for us.

1303
01:16:42,567 --> 01:16:44,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I think maybe Stephanie always used to ask for it.

1304
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:48,511
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a sheet that showed

1305
01:16:49,258 --> 01:16:57,151
[SPEAKER_09]: all the bond indebtedness that we had, but it rolled out 30 years, and it showed us when something was going to end.

1306
01:16:57,972 --> 01:17:03,381
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a very helpful tool for us to examine everything.

1307
01:17:04,594 --> 01:17:09,299
[SPEAKER_09]: It had big items on there that we're still paying off, some of the schools and all that type of stuff.

1308
01:17:09,839 --> 01:17:19,870
[SPEAKER_09]: And then some smaller, bigger items, like every time we have to drop several hundred thousand dollars on a new fire truck, things that we'd bond maybe for a shorter term.

1309
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:36,656
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think it would be very helpful in us looking at that, and I agree with Councilor Penter in the sense that we need to be updated on where we are with the city yard, what's going on with that, and most especially with the police station.

1310
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:42,758
[SPEAKER_09]: The last meeting we had on that several months ago, it was still called out.

1311
01:17:43,839 --> 01:17:46,547
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're waiting for an update.

1312
01:17:46,567 --> 01:17:50,859
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know sometimes getting engineer studies and soil samples and all that kind of stuff.

1313
01:17:51,497 --> 01:17:53,958
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes time to compile and pull together.

1314
01:17:54,578 --> 01:18:04,601
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, the scenario, tentative scenario that was laid out for us for the police station wasn't something that was pleasing to me, I must say.

1315
01:18:04,621 --> 01:18:15,623
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd really like to see where we are with that before we get too far in something that maybe more than one of us will find disagreeable.

1316
01:18:18,024 --> 01:18:25,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right in asking for this update as soon as possible.

1317
01:18:26,188 --> 01:18:43,575
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have aspects of the pool that are time sensitive, and I know access issues are very important to an awful lot of us, but that doesn't mean we can't proceed while examining, straightening that out.

1318
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:51,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm grateful for all of that, and I hope that we can make progress on this, Mr. President.

1319
01:18:52,529 --> 01:19:06,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Another paper that's germane to this is the mention of the pool that this evening at 5.30, the Medford City Council met in Committee of the Whole at Medford High School in the reconstruction area of the Medford High School pool.

1320
01:19:08,019 --> 01:19:13,243
[SPEAKER_03]: At that meeting was Mayor McGlynn, John Buckley, owner's project manager, Stephanie Muccini-Burke,

1321
01:19:14,138 --> 01:19:25,205
[SPEAKER_03]: budget director, Roy Belson, superintendent of schools, Roger Wendt was there, director of buildings and grounds, the architects and the consultants were there along with members of the school committee and the interest public.

1322
01:19:26,065 --> 01:19:37,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it was a very informative meeting to be on site to see the, uh, uh, the witness firsthand the condition and, uh, the necessary repairs are going to be needed for that particular, uh, project.

1323
01:19:37,212 --> 01:19:43,816
[SPEAKER_03]: And as council Lungo-Koehn is included in her suspension, her resolution, the school pool costs be included.

1324
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:50,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Mr. Clark, uh, read the committee report, please.

1325
01:19:50,996 --> 01:19:53,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yes, it was, uh, three recommendations came out of committee.

1326
01:19:53,937 --> 01:20:06,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, one was, uh, that there'd be a fully supported funded, um, line item in the budget for, for maintenance schedule for all these projects, upcoming projects.

1327
01:20:07,462 --> 01:20:14,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, two is the administration looking to, uh, spectator seating for the events at the method high school for,

1328
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:36,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And three by council caveo is to consider in the bid process, uh, I'm sure what the wording, but the scrap metal of, uh, you want to amend that because new pool total costs for a brand new pool.

1329
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:39,581
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1330
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:40,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Council one go current.

1331
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:45,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to further amend it to include, um, a lift to the,

1332
01:20:45,876 --> 01:20:55,599
[SPEAKER_00]: above ground spectator, um, room to, to investigate the cost of, uh, they said about 30,000 to put in a lift.

1333
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:59,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So they investigate, you look a lift to the batting cages.

1334
01:20:59,540 --> 01:20:59,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1335
01:21:00,661 --> 01:21:02,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the cost of a lift.

1336
01:21:02,701 --> 01:21:02,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1337
01:21:04,882 --> 01:21:05,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1338
01:21:05,622 --> 01:21:08,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to like talk with the other counselors before the meeting.

1339
01:21:09,763 --> 01:21:13,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a matter that is going to take some time to discuss.

1340
01:21:13,845 --> 01:21:14,945
[SPEAKER_03]: So June 12th,

1341
01:21:16,744 --> 01:21:23,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I call a committee of the whole meeting, that's a Wednesday evening, to go all over these projects and give them the time that's necessary.

1342
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:29,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And the responses that the council requires and has asked for.

1343
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:30,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta?

1344
01:21:31,449 --> 01:21:34,850
[SPEAKER_07]: At the meeting tonight, there were two papers that were handled of updates.

1345
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:35,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you got one of them.

1346
01:21:37,071 --> 01:21:37,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1347
01:21:37,391 --> 01:21:37,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1348
01:21:37,751 --> 01:21:40,092
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think all the council should get copies of them.

1349
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:41,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Rubens or Jeff?

1350
01:21:43,694 --> 01:21:44,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Messon, what happened to Larry?

1351
01:21:47,677 --> 01:21:49,318
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, is this what you're talking about?

1352
01:21:49,358 --> 01:21:49,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1353
01:21:49,658 --> 01:21:51,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was another two-page one that they had given out.

1354
01:21:51,919 --> 01:21:52,599
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it.

1355
01:21:52,619 --> 01:21:53,199
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all I have.

1356
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:53,719
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1357
01:21:53,739 --> 01:21:54,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, it's three pages.

1358
01:21:57,481 --> 01:21:57,621
[SPEAKER_03]: OK?

1359
01:21:57,841 --> 01:21:58,501
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a copy of that.

1360
01:21:58,581 --> 01:21:59,522
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put it in the boxes.

1361
01:21:59,942 --> 01:22:00,222
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1362
01:22:00,642 --> 01:22:01,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record?

1363
01:22:02,003 --> 01:22:05,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Carolyn Rosen, 25 Russell Road in Medford, Mass.

1364
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:13,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to make one comment to you about the capital budget process, your budget process.

1365
01:22:16,107 --> 01:22:29,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year, I think it was, when Mayor McGlynn first came out with his capital investment plan, I wrote a letter in the paper which was quite extensive about what I was seeing in both the budget process and how capital plan was being presented.

1366
01:22:30,489 --> 01:22:41,013
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would like to say what I've observed and learned in working beside you as a citizen observing your meetings and reading through the extensive material.

1367
01:22:42,093 --> 01:22:53,677
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to recommend as you move forward around the capital plan that you consider how you move away from a political process and more into a transparent

1368
01:22:55,015 --> 01:22:59,798
[SPEAKER_11]: full disclosure process around financial matters within the city.

1369
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:12,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like the capital plan itself became almost like spitballs up against the wall to see what would politically fly and then the political strife that kind of came

1370
01:23:12,907 --> 01:23:14,849
[SPEAKER_11]: and went with different projects.

1371
01:23:15,469 --> 01:23:38,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of really the city administration sitting down with you and really talking about what are the key priorities within the city, what are the human rights issues in the city, when we talk about women police not having access to proper facilities, we're talking not only about public safety, we're talking about the human rights

1372
01:23:38,709 --> 01:23:44,332
[SPEAKER_11]: of women in this city and whether they continue to be treated as second-class citizens.

1373
01:23:44,832 --> 01:24:02,881
[SPEAKER_11]: When we talk about the poll, I'm the one who pointed out you were looking at a 2007 draft study that told the city administration there was no accessibility budgeted into that study, that it was no inflationary dollars that you were told that you would need to consider.

1374
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:08,135
[SPEAKER_11]: The story changes as it goes along and these things become revealed.

1375
01:24:08,656 --> 01:24:14,543
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the citizens in this city deserve more in this kind of process.

1376
01:24:14,964 --> 01:24:21,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the public municipal workers deserve more from this particular process.

1377
01:24:21,564 --> 01:24:45,773
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the taxpayers deserve more from this particular process so that you know when your taxes are increasing, that it is resolving issues, that it's not becoming political issues for the next election cycle, and that we are resolving these issues in a way that's not creating political strife among the various constituencies within the city.

1378
01:24:47,794 --> 01:24:56,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say to you in regards to the budget process, here we are, it's almost June 1st, you haven't even started to see what your budgets are for your department.

1379
01:24:57,366 --> 01:25:07,198
[SPEAKER_11]: What I learned as a CFO with over 25 years of experience of presenting budgets to board of directors, which is essentially what you are,

1380
01:25:07,639 --> 01:25:15,342
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not just presented an incremental budget that shows you what last year's budget is and then comparing it to this year's budget.

1381
01:25:15,683 --> 01:25:24,026
[SPEAKER_11]: But also, where do you forecast you're going to end this year so that you know where your priorities were in your expenditures?

1382
01:25:24,527 --> 01:25:34,191
[SPEAKER_11]: So that instead of seeing last year's budget replicated with some escalating changes that they can explain, where did you actually end up spending your money?

1383
01:25:34,251 --> 01:25:36,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Did that budget actually meet

1384
01:25:36,972 --> 01:25:43,533
[SPEAKER_11]: the actual expenditures you had to make this year so you understood where your priorities ended up.

1385
01:25:43,733 --> 01:25:48,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that budget as good as it should have been to where your money actually ended up?

1386
01:25:48,654 --> 01:25:56,036
[SPEAKER_11]: You end up with a lot of appropriation changes in July that you're asked to move around to make sure your budget balances.

1387
01:25:56,276 --> 01:26:06,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand you have to budget and balance that municipal budget, but there's no analysis presented to you as to where you actually ended up.

1388
01:26:06,378 --> 01:26:15,904
[SPEAKER_11]: and why those appropriations have to happen, and did that mean that we didn't really look at where our resources were truly needed to be directed.

1389
01:26:16,425 --> 01:26:20,467
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would say to you, as you move forward in this process,

1390
01:26:21,528 --> 01:26:30,120
[SPEAKER_11]: We hold you responsible for taking it out of the political issues and bringing it more into truly what this city needs to move forward.

1391
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,283
[SPEAKER_11]: And you owe that to all of us.

1392
01:26:32,944 --> 01:26:38,071
[SPEAKER_11]: I would gladly talk offline to any of you to further explain what I'm talking about.

1393
01:26:38,442 --> 01:26:53,168
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will tell you when I presented that article in the transcript last year, I got people pulling me off the street coming up telling me how much they appreciated that I talked about the people don't want to hear the political issues.

1394
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:57,469
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't want to hear you grandstanding for the next election.

1395
01:26:57,769 --> 01:26:59,390
[SPEAKER_11]: They want things resolved.

1396
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:18,670
[SPEAKER_11]: And the only way you can do that is the city administration works with you also seriously to prioritize what really needs to be done in this city and how we can do it in a way that people can continue to live in their homes, especially the elderly, without a burdensome tax

1397
01:27:19,691 --> 01:27:25,893
[SPEAKER_11]: rate that no one looks at until December, and then all of a sudden we're surprised that the rate went up again.

1398
01:27:26,313 --> 01:27:36,656
[SPEAKER_11]: So when you get those bond schedules, you should get asked also for an analysis right up front when you see the FY14 budget as to what that taxpayer rate's going to be.

1399
01:27:37,036 --> 01:27:38,536
[SPEAKER_11]: It shouldn't be a guessing game.

1400
01:27:38,896 --> 01:27:39,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1401
01:27:40,097 --> 01:27:40,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1402
01:27:40,477 --> 01:27:41,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President de la Rusa?

1403
01:27:44,578 --> 01:27:47,199
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could, through the chair, Ms.

1404
01:27:47,239 --> 01:27:47,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Rosen,

1405
01:27:50,894 --> 01:28:04,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So you pointed out a way of presenting budget and analyzing how each department finishes out each year, how it spent its money.

1406
01:28:05,542 --> 01:28:14,166
[SPEAKER_09]: And oftentimes when we get to the end of the year, we do so without doing so in that, you know,

1407
01:28:15,424 --> 01:28:22,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Department X has $30,000 left over that it didn't spend, and it's the last week in June.

1408
01:28:22,827 --> 01:28:32,370
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to take that money and throw it into Department Y, who overspent $60,000, and hope let's try to find the other 30 somewhere.

1409
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:44,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Vis-a-vis the whole capital improvement program, which I think is built into our budget as far as our indebtedness,

1410
01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:45,730
[SPEAKER_09]: throughout the S.Y.

1411
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:50,731
[SPEAKER_09]: debt service each year is budgeted, because we know that's going to be what it is.

1412
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:58,013
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you think we can then better improve the budget process?

1413
01:28:58,473 --> 01:29:08,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think, for one thing, I don't know if you folks get a report back monthly or quarterly on where you are to budget to actual expenditure.

1414
01:29:08,856 --> 01:29:10,236
[SPEAKER_11]: We receive it monthly.

1415
01:29:10,908 --> 01:29:14,410
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's never seemed to be presented to the public.

1416
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:17,552
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how you look at that.

1417
01:29:17,612 --> 01:29:23,835
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a tool to be used to head off what I call overrun in budget.

1418
01:29:24,796 --> 01:29:28,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, you're going to have things that come up that can't be anticipated.

1419
01:29:29,436 --> 01:29:35,640
[SPEAKER_11]: You talk a lot about maintenance budgets not being met or even budgeted for.

1420
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:51,108
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems to me it's a game where we just say the budget's the same every year with some changes in personnel, somebody retires, we've got to do this or that, but there's never a discussion as to how

1421
01:29:51,661 --> 01:30:00,825
[SPEAKER_11]: a school committee is going to meet that maintenance budget that you're requiring and what other priorities and resources have to be redirected to do that.

1422
01:30:01,666 --> 01:30:09,509
[SPEAKER_11]: And to hear it every month or every year, complaining the school committee didn't budget that, well, you've got limited dollars.

1423
01:30:10,069 --> 01:30:13,671
[SPEAKER_11]: So now you have to figure out what you're going to have to give up to do that.

1424
01:30:16,352 --> 01:30:20,155
[SPEAKER_11]: The public never hears that kind of dialogue from you at all.

1425
01:30:21,415 --> 01:30:36,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, again, I'm not privy to what information you get, but I think when it gets to this level, I know your committee of the whole meeting is more your working meeting, but when it gets to the city council, it starts to get to the rhetoric level as opposed to really solving

1426
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:41,946
[SPEAKER_11]: the issues of how we redirect those resources and what we have to give up.

1427
01:30:42,006 --> 01:30:45,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And there may be things we can't give up, but we still need to meet the maintenance.

1428
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:58,711
[SPEAKER_11]: But you've got to be able to explain that to the public if we have to raise tax dollars so they understand that there's some priority, there's some quantifiable goal, there's some way that it's being held accountable.

1429
01:30:59,111 --> 01:31:03,472
[SPEAKER_11]: But I never hear that from this body, from the city administration.

1430
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:20,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So starting out with the budget, because I sit on a board for the non-profit, and when we go through our annual budget, we do a projection that we know we're going to have this to work with, X. And then we build to that goal.

1431
01:31:20,843 --> 01:31:24,905
[SPEAKER_09]: And part of that goal in the non-profit is an aspect of fundraising for operations.

1432
01:31:25,426 --> 01:31:28,168
[SPEAKER_09]: But nonetheless, we meet that.

1433
01:31:29,614 --> 01:31:40,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I've often thought that that might be a more helpful way of doing what we do here, though it's tough because there's so much unknown.

1434
01:31:40,518 --> 01:31:58,145
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I think that sort of a, and we had talked about this as a group, and I'm sure you remember as far as when we've, several years ago, when we got up to the point of this capital improvement program,

1435
01:31:59,216 --> 01:32:19,885
[SPEAKER_09]: that as a council we had envisioned a visioning process that would be collaborative and something that would have open communication, clarity in goals that we then come to agreement on and reach.

1436
01:32:21,587 --> 01:32:34,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I think to a degree, we did that without going through that process, because the way government communicates in Medford isn't what one may describe as healthy.

1437
01:32:37,539 --> 01:32:38,940
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're doing that.

1438
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:47,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think what you're trying to say, or what you are saying, is, well, then let's do that in a healthy, transparent way.

1439
01:32:47,727 --> 01:32:47,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1440
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:51,871
[SPEAKER_09]: involves participation.

1441
01:32:52,751 --> 01:32:52,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1442
01:32:53,571 --> 01:33:06,216
[SPEAKER_11]: And decides that a police department is more important than some private not-for-profit getting certain monies, because right now, public dollars have to go to public issues.

1443
01:33:06,236 --> 01:33:07,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1444
01:33:07,317 --> 01:33:16,340
[SPEAKER_11]: And not making it a political thing where you're bringing groups together to have to fight for that issue, that we all understand why we're having to go for the police department.

1445
01:33:18,996 --> 01:33:24,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I will just add one other thing that's my human rights issue is also around the disability issue.

1446
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:46,132
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, it was incomprehensible that a city in this day and age would put forth a budget on a poll that, one, did not include inflationary dollars, that did not include a thought around the accessibility issue, and was publicly stated in the document that was put out to the public.

1447
01:33:47,353 --> 01:33:58,915
[SPEAKER_11]: That becomes a political process where people with disabilities are now having to come up to fight for that accessibility and being set up against the pool coach because she wants her program

1448
01:33:59,935 --> 01:34:13,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of really sitting down and this is what we need to do, we need to come back with a study, we may need to spend money to further that study to come back with the right information and what all we need to cover.

1449
01:34:13,923 --> 01:34:17,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I have questions around the poll, not because I'm against or for the poll,

1450
01:34:17,765 --> 01:34:32,934
[SPEAKER_11]: But when we're talking about accessibility for people with disabilities, are there programs for the disability students up at the high school for sports, like there is with Title IX for girls?

1451
01:34:33,435 --> 01:34:34,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any thought to that?

1452
01:34:35,156 --> 01:34:43,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there thought to the associated cost of having faculty that are equipped to train those folks?

1453
01:34:43,781 --> 01:34:46,803
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw a wonderful young woman on ABC News recently

1454
01:34:47,203 --> 01:35:01,443
[SPEAKER_11]: who's blind, legally blind, probably can see out of a pinhole, but she's a major poll voter in this country, in high school, and with a slight accessibility accommodation that her coach created,

1455
01:35:02,424 --> 01:35:04,665
[SPEAKER_11]: She's been able to outperform everyone.

1456
01:35:04,705 --> 01:35:07,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is in Texas, a conservative state.

1457
01:35:08,446 --> 01:35:18,989
[SPEAKER_11]: And in a liberal state of Massachusetts, a liberal city of Medford, Massachusetts, we came forward with a plan that didn't even include a thought around accessibility.

1458
01:35:19,709 --> 01:35:20,829
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll find it somewhere.

1459
01:35:21,309 --> 01:35:26,851
[SPEAKER_11]: So the thought becomes, if we build, maybe they'll come.

1460
01:35:27,371 --> 01:35:30,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of, if we build, they will come.

1461
01:35:31,394 --> 01:35:32,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you understand?

1462
01:35:32,374 --> 01:35:36,696
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, it becomes like the women's issue in the locker room at the police department.

1463
01:35:36,796 --> 01:35:51,081
[SPEAKER_11]: You become second class citizens and you have to fight for that right through a political process as opposed to the city doing what it should be doing around really strategically looking at each project and what it really is going to take.

1464
01:35:51,521 --> 01:35:56,543
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, do you know if the police department is actually going to be accessible not only for

1465
01:35:57,804 --> 01:36:10,912
[SPEAKER_11]: people who may be hired who have disabilities, but even the offenders or alleged offenders who may need representation, may have to have accessibility around medical issues in that department.

1466
01:36:11,472 --> 01:36:19,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, these are things that it just, it doesn't seem to be a strategic way of dealing with our finances here.

1467
01:36:20,578 --> 01:36:20,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1468
01:36:21,338 --> 01:36:22,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your thoughtful questions.

1469
01:36:22,379 --> 01:36:23,479
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Councilor Caraviello.

1470
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:24,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1471
01:36:24,755 --> 01:36:27,756
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I agree with Mrs. Rose 100% on the budget.

1472
01:36:29,377 --> 01:36:35,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Last year, when I joined the council, when I got my first budget here, I was kind of shocked to see how it wasn't an actual budget.

1473
01:36:36,179 --> 01:36:43,522
[SPEAKER_16]: And this year, when the budget comes out, I'd like to see an actual budget presented so we know what departments are over and under.

1474
01:36:43,542 --> 01:36:46,843
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I don't want to see that your department was given $100,000 and they spent $100,000.

1475
01:36:46,883 --> 01:36:48,484
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not a budget.

1476
01:36:52,438 --> 01:36:56,380
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if the school department can do it, I'm sure that this building can do it.

1477
01:36:57,661 --> 01:36:59,302
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with Councilwoman Locarno.

1478
01:37:00,382 --> 01:37:12,489
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we need to know where we're standing on all these bond issues because, you know, from the day I joined this council, I was told that the police department was going to fall down.

1479
01:37:12,589 --> 01:37:14,390
[SPEAKER_16]: It couldn't be fixed.

1480
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:20,653
[SPEAKER_16]: And it looks like the police department is going to be the sacrificial lamb in all the projects that are going through.

1481
01:37:21,054 --> 01:37:21,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, all of a sudden,

1482
01:37:22,278 --> 01:37:23,578
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's really not that bad.

1483
01:37:24,859 --> 01:37:28,580
[SPEAKER_16]: And from day one, I was told it was deplorable and was going to fall down.

1484
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,340
[SPEAKER_16]: But now it's kind of OK.

1485
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:31,760
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we can make it work.

1486
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:39,202
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we should have the treasurer where we stand in all these things.

1487
01:37:39,622 --> 01:37:47,104
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd hate to see the pool get held up, because these children were counting on the swim team using it this year.

1488
01:37:48,084 --> 01:37:50,525
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, like Councilor Mark said, there's no sense having

1489
01:37:51,161 --> 01:37:52,362
[SPEAKER_16]: swim team if nobody can see the team.

1490
01:37:54,564 --> 01:37:56,045
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that issue needs to be discussed.

1491
01:37:56,905 --> 01:38:05,192
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't say we'll do the pool and then when the pool's done, we'll figure out where the stands are gonna go.

1492
01:38:05,232 --> 01:38:07,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything's gotta work in one.

1493
01:38:08,614 --> 01:38:16,520
[SPEAKER_16]: But like I said, I would support her action for the treasurer to give us a report on where we stand on all the ones.

1494
01:38:17,921 --> 01:38:18,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1495
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:19,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Council Marks.

1496
01:38:20,290 --> 01:38:21,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1497
01:38:21,311 --> 01:38:25,333
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate what Carol Rosen had to say.

1498
01:38:25,353 --> 01:38:26,514
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of that makes sense.

1499
01:38:27,274 --> 01:38:34,919
[SPEAKER_17]: However, in order to accomplish some of what Carolyn spoke about, you need to have seven independent counselors.

1500
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:38,201
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's key to the process.

1501
01:38:38,961 --> 01:38:47,166
[SPEAKER_17]: If people aren't going to be independent behind this reeling, then it does break down to just a political process.

1502
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:49,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Does the mayor have his votes?

1503
01:38:49,711 --> 01:38:51,772
[SPEAKER_17]: And then he pushes his initiatives through.

1504
01:38:52,252 --> 01:39:06,801
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, tonight, Councilor Penta mentioned to the mayor at the very end, I don't know if anyone else heard, Councilor Penta asked, he said, Mr. Mayor, because this project now, you're asking for an additional million dollars, I'd like for you to sit down and create a priority list.

1505
01:39:07,201 --> 01:39:09,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that what you stated, Councilor Penta?

1506
01:39:10,503 --> 01:39:14,186
[SPEAKER_17]: And the mayor said, I'm not gonna sit down and put together a priority list.

1507
01:39:14,546 --> 01:39:16,427
[SPEAKER_17]: He said, we can afford to do everything.

1508
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:18,731
[SPEAKER_17]: That's exactly what the mayor said.

1509
01:39:19,712 --> 01:39:21,074
[SPEAKER_17]: We can afford to do everything.

1510
01:39:21,994 --> 01:39:42,894
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's great, Carolyn, I can agree with what you're saying, the fact that we need to sit down and so forth, but if you have the mentality that we're hearing from the administration that there's no priority list, there's no list based on what we can afford to do, because according to the mayor, we can afford everything.

1511
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:47,661
[SPEAKER_17]: And not only can we afford everything, we can afford to do it right now.

1512
01:39:49,081 --> 01:39:51,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Not that we should have done it over the last 20 years.

1513
01:39:52,422 --> 01:39:59,225
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, when the DPW building was condemned years ago, the police station has been a pit for years.

1514
01:40:00,945 --> 01:40:01,865
[SPEAKER_17]: A pit for years.

1515
01:40:02,245 --> 01:40:04,426
[SPEAKER_17]: The high school pool's been down for seven years.

1516
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:13,449
[SPEAKER_17]: And the associated cost we heard about, the additional 1.2 million, was further deterioration.

1517
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:18,272
[SPEAKER_17]: So because we didn't do, as you mentioned, Councilor Caraviello, why don't we do this seven years ago?

1518
01:40:18,592 --> 01:40:22,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we waited, it cost us an additional several hundred thousands of dollars.

1519
01:40:23,354 --> 01:40:25,635
[SPEAKER_17]: And as Carolyn mentioned, and I mentioned it last week.

1520
01:40:27,876 --> 01:40:30,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that was part of it, was further deterioration.

1521
01:40:30,517 --> 01:40:31,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Also inflation.

1522
01:40:32,698 --> 01:40:36,020
[SPEAKER_17]: Now there's an inflationary index regarding construction.

1523
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:43,703
[SPEAKER_17]: So if the mayor took the cost from a 2007 architectural report that was established saying the report's gonna

1524
01:40:44,102 --> 01:40:46,003
[SPEAKER_17]: uh, the pool is going to cost us 2.3 million.

1525
01:40:46,423 --> 01:40:47,804
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor could have looked up the index.

1526
01:40:47,864 --> 01:40:55,529
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got someone in the building department look up the cost of construction work done in 2007 compared to construction work done in 2013.

1527
01:40:55,949 --> 01:41:00,672
[SPEAKER_17]: And he could have said, counsel, I know the figure has increased by three, $400,000.

1528
01:41:01,413 --> 01:41:09,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that's still not an exact figure, but I know there's an additional three or 4,000, three or $400,000 built into this.

1529
01:41:10,018 --> 01:41:11,759
[SPEAKER_17]: But when he came to us several months back,

1530
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:18,537
[SPEAKER_17]: As I stated to the mayor tonight, one of the first questions, Mr. Mayor, you originally asked us for $2.3 million.

1531
01:41:18,817 --> 01:41:22,019
[SPEAKER_17]: And at the time, you knew there was accessibility issues.

1532
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:23,761
[SPEAKER_17]: At the time, you knew there was inflation.

1533
01:41:24,341 --> 01:41:26,002
[SPEAKER_17]: You knew all this already, Mr. Mayor.

1534
01:41:26,262 --> 01:41:28,224
[SPEAKER_17]: Why would you come to us for $2.3 million?

1535
01:41:29,144 --> 01:41:34,168
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said there was no way of figuring this out until a secondary report was done.

1536
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:41,153
[SPEAKER_17]: And the only thing I can think of now is, we're all on board with the DPW yet.

1537
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,561
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that the figure that we voted on?

1538
01:41:44,582 --> 01:41:48,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that the figure that we're going to end up costing for the DPWR?

1539
01:41:48,865 --> 01:41:50,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Or is it going to be double or triple that?

1540
01:41:51,387 --> 01:41:54,509
[SPEAKER_17]: Because that seems to be the process how it works.

1541
01:41:58,092 --> 01:42:05,778
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how every other entity and every other company and business and municipality does it, but it just doesn't make sense.

1542
01:42:07,659 --> 01:42:09,280
[SPEAKER_17]: as someone was quoted in the paper saying.

1543
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:15,304
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what, Mr. Mayor, if that wasn't a fair and accurate estimate, then why give one?

1544
01:42:16,364 --> 01:42:17,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Why come out?

1545
01:42:18,645 --> 01:42:21,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it was the politically correct thing to do?

1546
01:42:22,408 --> 01:42:30,192
[SPEAKER_17]: Come out ahead of time and say, okay, we got the pool on target now, and I'll go back and get a million dollars somewhere down the line?

1547
01:42:30,472 --> 01:42:31,273
[SPEAKER_17]: We heard that tonight.

1548
01:42:32,113 --> 01:42:34,315
[SPEAKER_17]: We were told by the administration tonight

1549
01:42:35,219 --> 01:42:43,743
[SPEAKER_17]: that once we do the pool, spectators, mothers, fathers, grandparents, sisters, brothers, can't watch their kid swimming and meet.

1550
01:42:44,024 --> 01:42:46,485
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nowhere for spectators to sit down.

1551
01:42:47,846 --> 01:42:50,367
[SPEAKER_17]: It's such a beautiful facility once it's done.

1552
01:42:50,707 --> 01:42:52,788
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nowhere for spectators to sit.

1553
01:42:53,568 --> 01:42:58,831
[SPEAKER_17]: And we heard from the mayor, which is par for the course, we'll handle that after.

1554
01:42:59,071 --> 01:43:00,232
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll take care of that after.

1555
01:43:01,553 --> 01:43:05,337
[SPEAKER_17]: similar to the field of dreams and the accessibility issue at the field of dreams.

1556
01:43:06,317 --> 01:43:08,179
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll make it accessible after the fact.

1557
01:43:08,199 --> 01:43:10,101
[SPEAKER_17]: We all know what happened with the field of dreams.

1558
01:43:11,782 --> 01:43:14,845
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't continue to operate a city in this fashion.

1559
01:43:16,086 --> 01:43:23,253
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree with councilor Penta, you know, we've been asking for this priority list for a long time now, several years.

1560
01:43:24,414 --> 01:43:26,376
[SPEAKER_17]: And finally the mayor came out with chart the course.

1561
01:43:28,134 --> 01:43:35,238
[SPEAKER_17]: And he gave us a list, not in any particular order, he refused to give it any order, a list of projects that need to be done.

1562
01:43:36,759 --> 01:43:43,283
[SPEAKER_17]: And we heard tonight the lack of maintenance seems to be the Achilles heel with this community.

1563
01:43:44,544 --> 01:43:48,606
[SPEAKER_17]: No maintenance, no maintenance, no upkeep, and everything deteriorates.

1564
01:43:50,928 --> 01:43:54,270
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't even know what the pool right now, who's gonna manage the pool?

1565
01:43:56,496 --> 01:43:58,237
[SPEAKER_17]: You saw the equipment in the basement.

1566
01:43:59,197 --> 01:44:07,060
[SPEAKER_17]: You saw those tanks that house the sand and the overflow for water, giant tanks that are six feet in circumference, 10 feet high.

1567
01:44:08,881 --> 01:44:15,204
[SPEAKER_17]: You think someone's going to go down there like you're changing your pool and look at the chemicals and dip a little cotton swab in there and say, oh, everything looks fine?

1568
01:44:16,544 --> 01:44:24,648
[SPEAKER_17]: You need constant 24-hour, seven-day-a-week maintenance and someone that knows how to handle pool maintenance specifically.

1569
01:44:25,575 --> 01:44:27,176
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's no mention of it at all.

1570
01:44:28,897 --> 01:44:30,839
[SPEAKER_17]: We heard how the pool may generate money.

1571
01:44:31,639 --> 01:44:34,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, don't worry, the mayor said, this pool's gonna generate money.

1572
01:44:34,921 --> 01:44:38,124
[SPEAKER_17]: And he referred to other communities that generate money with their pool.

1573
01:44:40,045 --> 01:44:41,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Just the business we wanna be in.

1574
01:44:42,927 --> 01:44:44,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Just the business we wanna be in.

1575
01:44:45,489 --> 01:44:48,931
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's rent our total facilities out to generate money.

1576
01:44:49,832 --> 01:44:52,854
[SPEAKER_17]: And not put a nickel back into the wear and tear and the upkeep.

1577
01:44:54,428 --> 01:44:56,990
[SPEAKER_17]: And in five years from now, we'll be discussing this pool again.

1578
01:44:57,010 --> 01:44:59,252
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all it's going to take.

1579
01:44:59,492 --> 01:45:00,933
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be discussing this pool again.

1580
01:45:04,456 --> 01:45:05,917
[SPEAKER_17]: These are the issues we have to look at.

1581
01:45:06,197 --> 01:45:07,218
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree with Carolyn.

1582
01:45:07,238 --> 01:45:11,041
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with members of this council and we should have the paperwork and so forth.

1583
01:45:11,502 --> 01:45:16,806
[SPEAKER_17]: But let me tell you, without seven independent counselors, none of this is going to happen.

1584
01:45:17,486 --> 01:45:19,368
[SPEAKER_17]: It's always going to be political.

1585
01:45:20,202 --> 01:45:21,042
[SPEAKER_17]: And Carolyn, you're right.

1586
01:45:21,502 --> 01:45:25,964
[SPEAKER_17]: What happens is they pin person against person, organization against organization.

1587
01:45:26,244 --> 01:45:29,085
[SPEAKER_17]: None of us are opposed to having a swimming pool at the high school.

1588
01:45:29,505 --> 01:45:31,186
[SPEAKER_17]: I swam in the pool when I was at the high school.

1589
01:45:31,986 --> 01:45:34,207
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a great asset we have as a community.

1590
01:45:34,747 --> 01:45:39,748
[SPEAKER_17]: We're lucky to have a pool of that size and caliber within our confines.

1591
01:45:40,469 --> 01:45:41,429
[SPEAKER_17]: We're very fortunate.

1592
01:45:44,190 --> 01:45:46,711
[SPEAKER_17]: But we can't continue to operate this way.

1593
01:45:47,191 --> 01:45:48,151
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't continue

1594
01:45:48,999 --> 01:45:53,781
[SPEAKER_17]: year after year after year to look back and say, well, what are we going to accomplish right now?

1595
01:45:54,822 --> 01:46:00,764
[SPEAKER_17]: These have to be done long-term, long-term systematic approaches to capital improvements.

1596
01:46:02,645 --> 01:46:05,026
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't do everything in a year or two.

1597
01:46:05,586 --> 01:46:14,170
[SPEAKER_17]: This is 20 years worth of neglect, 20 years of neglect and lack of upkeep, and we want to accomplish it in one or two years.

1598
01:46:15,271 --> 01:46:17,612
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we're looking to do, one or two years.

1599
01:46:19,804 --> 01:46:20,665
[SPEAKER_17]: It can't happen.

1600
01:46:21,045 --> 01:46:24,809
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't afford, we can't sustain spending of that nature.

1601
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:26,431
[SPEAKER_17]: People are struggling now.

1602
01:46:28,312 --> 01:46:31,416
[SPEAKER_17]: And the last thing they want is their taxes to go skyrocketing.

1603
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,562
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we're in a rock and a hard place.

1604
01:46:37,582 --> 01:46:39,984
[SPEAKER_17]: We already, seven of us already took a vote on the pool.

1605
01:46:41,546 --> 01:46:42,687
[SPEAKER_17]: We already said we support

1606
01:46:43,919 --> 01:46:45,100
[SPEAKER_17]: having a pool at the high school.

1607
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,121
[SPEAKER_17]: We even think it's a priority, and we're going to move forward.

1608
01:46:48,622 --> 01:46:53,224
[SPEAKER_17]: And then to come back several months later and say, you know what?

1609
01:46:53,244 --> 01:46:55,425
[SPEAKER_17]: There are some additional costs of $1.2 million.

1610
01:46:55,486 --> 01:47:02,710
[SPEAKER_17]: The total project was $2.3 million.

1611
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:05,191
[SPEAKER_17]: You come back with $1.2 million.

1612
01:47:06,492 --> 01:47:07,592
[SPEAKER_17]: How outrageous is that?

1613
01:47:08,673 --> 01:47:09,733
[SPEAKER_17]: I could see $50,000, $75,000 for different costs.

1614
01:47:12,751 --> 01:47:13,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Another million too.

1615
01:47:15,092 --> 01:47:19,235
[SPEAKER_17]: And the phone calls I'm receiving is, geez, how come the council's not supporting the pool?

1616
01:47:19,855 --> 01:47:21,196
[SPEAKER_17]: How come you don't want the kids?

1617
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:26,879
[SPEAKER_17]: My son or daughter has to get up at five in the morning to go swim somewhere else, and I have to drive them.

1618
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:32,802
[SPEAKER_17]: And I sympathize with the parents, because they've been doing this for seven years.

1619
01:47:34,403 --> 01:47:38,445
[SPEAKER_17]: However, what I explain to the parents is, the council's on board with the pool.

1620
01:47:39,045 --> 01:47:40,286
[SPEAKER_17]: As I stated to the mayor tonight,

1621
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:43,531
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought there were going to be people swimming in there right now.

1622
01:47:44,631 --> 01:47:45,631
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why we took the vote.

1623
01:47:49,313 --> 01:47:51,073
[SPEAKER_17]: And now we're being told it's another million, too.

1624
01:47:52,294 --> 01:47:53,774
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the locker room is a different issue.

1625
01:47:54,695 --> 01:47:57,716
[SPEAKER_17]: And he found, miraculously found funding for the locker room.

1626
01:47:58,516 --> 01:48:00,597
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not going to cost us much for the locker room.

1627
01:48:04,178 --> 01:48:05,218
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, Mr. President.

1628
01:48:06,619 --> 01:48:10,260
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, at some point, something has to give.

1629
01:48:13,456 --> 01:48:15,737
[SPEAKER_17]: And the administration was up there in full force tonight.

1630
01:48:16,738 --> 01:48:17,118
[SPEAKER_17]: It's funny.

1631
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:25,102
[SPEAKER_17]: We have the bond initiative before us to vote on the actual expenditure and not one department head shows up.

1632
01:48:26,122 --> 01:48:27,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Not one person from the administration.

1633
01:48:29,404 --> 01:48:31,144
[SPEAKER_17]: We call for a meeting on site at the pool.

1634
01:48:33,005 --> 01:48:33,706
[SPEAKER_17]: We couldn't get in the room.

1635
01:48:33,726 --> 01:48:35,586
[SPEAKER_17]: There was so many people from the administration up there.

1636
01:48:36,947 --> 01:48:38,688
[SPEAKER_17]: It was mobbed with people from the administration.

1637
01:48:41,786 --> 01:48:45,668
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were quick to come to the mayor's defense when things were mentioned.

1638
01:48:46,068 --> 01:48:48,350
[SPEAKER_17]: They were quick to say, oh, that's not true.

1639
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:52,212
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nothing in the report, as Diane McLeod said tonight.

1640
01:48:52,892 --> 01:48:56,414
[SPEAKER_17]: There's nothing in the report in 2007 that talked about accessibility.

1641
01:48:57,355 --> 01:49:00,737
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, there most certainly was something in the 2007 report.

1642
01:49:01,017 --> 01:49:09,402
[SPEAKER_17]: You should take a further look at it that mentioned, if you do the construction of the pool, it's going to trigger off accessibility issues.

1643
01:49:10,609 --> 01:49:13,330
[SPEAKER_17]: So be on notice that you're going to have additional cost.

1644
01:49:13,871 --> 01:49:15,071
[SPEAKER_17]: And the city was on notice.

1645
01:49:16,132 --> 01:49:19,153
[SPEAKER_17]: The city knew about these additional costs back in 2007.

1646
01:49:21,214 --> 01:49:23,835
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have department heads saying, there was no mention of that.

1647
01:49:24,295 --> 01:49:26,476
[SPEAKER_17]: We weren't looking for accessibility issues.

1648
01:49:27,377 --> 01:49:36,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, they mentioned tonight that when the project came out, all they were looking to do was the pool and the surrounding platform around the pool.

1649
01:49:38,271 --> 01:49:41,593
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mentioned to the department head, why didn't we look at something else?

1650
01:49:41,893 --> 01:49:42,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's what we looked at.

1651
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:48,716
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, you looked at it because that was what you asked the architect to look at.

1652
01:49:50,837 --> 01:49:52,818
[SPEAKER_17]: You asked them to look at that specifically.

1653
01:49:53,198 --> 01:49:54,379
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we're going to pay you to do.

1654
01:49:54,679 --> 01:49:55,960
[SPEAKER_17]: You give us the results on this.

1655
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:58,141
[SPEAKER_17]: What do we need for a pool and a platform?

1656
01:50:00,142 --> 01:50:06,745
[SPEAKER_17]: So it was the administration that said, we're not going to look at accessibility issues in the bathroom, in the locker rooms.

1657
01:50:08,373 --> 01:50:10,994
[SPEAKER_17]: They're the ones that commissioned the report, not this council.

1658
01:50:12,895 --> 01:50:24,499
[SPEAKER_17]: So the only reason why the locker rooms weren't looked at in 2007 was because the administration, at that point, maybe didn't feel it was necessary to talk about accessibility.

1659
01:50:26,659 --> 01:50:32,781
[SPEAKER_17]: Or maybe felt by talking about accessibility, you're going to inflate the project, the cost of the project.

1660
01:50:33,962 --> 01:50:36,103
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe you can't fly a project for 3.5,

1661
01:50:37,802 --> 01:50:40,525
[SPEAKER_17]: million, but you could fly a project for $2.3 million.

1662
01:50:42,286 --> 01:50:43,327
[SPEAKER_17]: These are the things.

1663
01:50:43,748 --> 01:50:51,395
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why, when I said last week, and I still stand by it, we should have been presented with a close estimate, the closest possible estimate.

1664
01:50:51,836 --> 01:50:52,957
[SPEAKER_17]: No smoke and mirrors.

1665
01:50:55,860 --> 01:51:00,164
[SPEAKER_17]: The closest possible estimate, Mr. President, so we could vote on it as a council.

1666
01:51:01,112 --> 01:51:06,013
[SPEAKER_17]: If we thought it's too expensive, as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, let's go back and look at some other proposals.

1667
01:51:06,553 --> 01:51:10,634
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we don't have to do X, we'll do Y. We'll do Z and Y, whatever it may be.

1668
01:51:12,074 --> 01:51:13,674
[SPEAKER_17]: But we were never given that opportunity.

1669
01:51:16,355 --> 01:51:17,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1670
01:51:17,715 --> 01:51:18,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1671
01:51:19,955 --> 01:51:21,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

1672
01:51:22,296 --> 01:51:23,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Lee Wood.

1673
01:51:23,876 --> 01:51:25,776
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to sit down a little bit.

1674
01:51:25,796 --> 01:51:26,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, sit down.

1675
01:51:27,076 --> 01:51:29,817
[SPEAKER_14]: My legs are tired and I'm getting old.

1676
01:51:30,646 --> 01:51:31,186
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.

1677
01:51:32,467 --> 01:51:33,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Very true, thank you.

1678
01:51:34,787 --> 01:51:39,008
[SPEAKER_14]: I also went to that meeting tonight, and I walked all the way through.

1679
01:51:40,109 --> 01:51:52,593
[SPEAKER_14]: I listened, and prior to the meeting though, I had a slight discussion with one of the administrators in the city.

1680
01:51:54,093 --> 01:51:57,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Bill, you don't represent the disabled, was first up.

1681
01:51:59,341 --> 01:52:01,101
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, well, that's very interesting.

1682
01:52:01,121 --> 01:52:02,802
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think you do either.

1683
01:52:04,842 --> 01:52:12,564
[SPEAKER_14]: And she admitted that she was representing the disabled, but I can't.

1684
01:52:14,345 --> 01:52:19,646
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thought to myself, gee, what was I doing in 19, bleh.

1685
01:52:19,666 --> 01:52:21,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I was 18 years old.

1686
01:52:24,428 --> 01:52:25,448
[SPEAKER_14]: What was I doing then?

1687
01:52:25,868 --> 01:52:36,551
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I was fighting with CEOC, Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee, in Cambridge Central Square, working to get the disabled.

1688
01:52:37,352 --> 01:52:43,513
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm 60, almost 68 years old, a couple more months.

1689
01:52:45,474 --> 01:52:49,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Gee, what was I doing in the 70s working for the disabled?

1690
01:52:50,967 --> 01:53:10,220
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, the budget that my wife, who is admitted to be disabled, after a great deal of encouragement by me, and I have a practice of counseling somewhere between 200 and 500 people all the time.

1691
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:13,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Some hate me because I tell them the truth.

1692
01:53:13,743 --> 01:53:15,004
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't do it that way.

1693
01:53:15,604 --> 01:53:18,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, your city, you can't do it the way you're going to do this pool.

1694
01:53:19,758 --> 01:53:23,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks alluded to you're going to be spending money.

1695
01:53:23,799 --> 01:53:26,180
[SPEAKER_14]: And Councilor Pente, you're right.

1696
01:53:27,341 --> 01:53:28,401
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to be spending money.

1697
01:53:29,121 --> 01:53:30,782
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll make an educated guess.

1698
01:53:30,962 --> 01:53:37,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Within three to five years after that pool is done, they'll be spending more money.

1699
01:53:38,925 --> 01:53:48,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Not just for getting people up into that, whatever they call it, birdcage upstairs.

1700
01:53:48,552 --> 01:53:51,874
[SPEAKER_14]: But you'll be spending money on the rights of the disabled.

1701
01:53:53,275 --> 01:53:54,376
[SPEAKER_14]: We're all getting older.

1702
01:53:55,076 --> 01:54:01,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of the things that were forgotten about were not just for disabled people there.

1703
01:54:02,382 --> 01:54:03,943
[SPEAKER_14]: So when I went back.

1704
01:54:04,605 --> 01:54:17,333
[SPEAKER_14]: thought about my argument or discussion a little earlier, I said, gee, when those handicap cuts in the street were done, who do you think helped start those?

1705
01:54:18,633 --> 01:54:22,956
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to stand a moment and bow my head to the man who did that.

1706
01:54:23,576 --> 01:54:27,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Bill.

1707
01:54:27,258 --> 01:54:29,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Who wrote ADA with Tom Harkin?

1708
01:54:30,627 --> 01:54:38,711
[SPEAKER_14]: and was on President Jimmy Carter's group of disabled who fought.

1709
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:41,953
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to stand up and thank the man who did that.

1710
01:54:42,133 --> 01:54:42,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Bill.

1711
01:54:45,075 --> 01:54:49,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Who started the Green Line extension with disabled people?

1712
01:54:50,158 --> 01:54:53,099
[SPEAKER_14]: More people than are on the Disability Commission.

1713
01:54:53,379 --> 01:54:54,480
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank that man.

1714
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:56,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Bill.

1715
01:54:57,522 --> 01:54:57,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Who?

1716
01:54:59,895 --> 01:55:10,404
[SPEAKER_14]: came up to this council and have said, over the last 10 years, at least walk disability issues and get stopped in the streets.

1717
01:55:11,403 --> 01:55:34,259
[SPEAKER_14]: who on Friday night at once a month with Councilor Cavallaro goes to a disability projects and volunteers his time and they stop and thank me over somewhere between 100 and 200 disabled people who sit and watch this council meeting and tell me to do more.

1718
01:55:35,478 --> 01:55:39,100
[SPEAKER_14]: and asked me to fight more for the disabled issue.

1719
01:55:39,881 --> 01:55:45,524
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen a disability group in the city any larger than that.

1720
01:55:46,404 --> 01:55:47,545
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not knocking them.

1721
01:55:49,646 --> 01:55:54,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I get $45,000, $50,000, $60,000 a year to do this?

1722
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:57,951
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

1723
01:55:58,911 --> 01:55:59,752
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never seen it.

1724
01:56:00,703 --> 01:56:03,004
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to read something to you.

1725
01:56:03,664 --> 01:56:08,866
[SPEAKER_14]: This comes out of the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division.

1726
01:56:10,286 --> 01:56:24,531
[SPEAKER_14]: An overview, accessible pools, entry and exits, providing equal opportunity to people with disability is the fundamental principle of the Americans for Disability Act.

1727
01:56:26,652 --> 01:56:29,073
[SPEAKER_14]: The publication designed to help Title II

1728
01:56:30,245 --> 01:56:44,448
[SPEAKER_14]: entitles understanding how new regulations requirements for swimming pools, especially existing pools, apply to them.

1729
01:56:45,128 --> 01:56:58,191
[SPEAKER_14]: People with disabilities were too long excluded from participation in many of the recreation activities, including swimming.

1730
01:57:01,992 --> 01:57:05,654
[SPEAKER_14]: All I heard was, we don't want to put any bars up.

1731
01:57:06,494 --> 01:57:07,354
[SPEAKER_14]: These are grips.

1732
01:57:08,055 --> 01:57:11,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Not only the grips, but let's look at this from another point of view.

1733
01:57:11,616 --> 01:57:16,118
[SPEAKER_14]: What if that was your mother, your grandmother, your sister, who isn't disabled?

1734
01:57:16,458 --> 01:57:17,038
[SPEAKER_14]: They'd use them.

1735
01:57:18,359 --> 01:57:19,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Another curb cut.

1736
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:22,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Who uses curb cuts the most?

1737
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:23,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody here know?

1738
01:57:24,381 --> 01:57:24,901
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll tell you.

1739
01:57:25,101 --> 01:57:26,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Women with baby carriages.

1740
01:57:28,363 --> 01:57:31,284
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not our only.

1741
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,071
[SPEAKER_14]: thing that we're talking about.

1742
01:57:34,511 --> 01:57:37,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, they're going to put some kind of stairway.

1743
01:57:37,192 --> 01:57:40,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not really sure, because I couldn't hear as well as everybody else.

1744
01:57:42,474 --> 01:57:47,496
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said to myself, well, that's nice, but is it going to be permanent?

1745
01:57:47,876 --> 01:57:48,937
[SPEAKER_14]: And they said, no.

1746
01:57:50,117 --> 01:57:59,001
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, somebody's got to go get the stairway, hang it down, or they're going to permanently put it on there, so that one person can come down that stair.

1747
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:04,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Ask a fireman, they'll talk about how people go down things.

1748
01:58:06,405 --> 01:58:11,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Ask yourself, they're going to put a lift, one person lift.

1749
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:13,572
[SPEAKER_14]: I asked that question.

1750
01:58:14,092 --> 01:58:19,277
[SPEAKER_14]: So two people who are disabled can get in the water, maybe.

1751
01:58:21,553 --> 01:58:22,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Think about this.

1752
01:58:22,313 --> 01:58:24,194
[SPEAKER_14]: I asked the mayor this to think about it.

1753
01:58:24,514 --> 01:58:26,374
[SPEAKER_14]: What if Special Olympics was to come in?

1754
01:58:27,095 --> 01:58:30,196
[SPEAKER_14]: They usually bring 50 people with them.

1755
01:58:30,696 --> 01:58:36,557
[SPEAKER_14]: They may all need to use it at the same time, the one lift.

1756
01:58:37,598 --> 01:58:40,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Two hours later, they're all in the pool.

1757
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:42,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Their time is up.

1758
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:44,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on.

1759
01:58:45,649 --> 01:59:00,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's look at, and I'm sorry, Mr. Penter and Mr., or Councilor Penter, I'm sorry, Councilor Knox, to the President, that I have to bring up to ask for you to think about spending money.

1760
01:59:00,741 --> 01:59:04,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm asking you, they're doing the bare minimum.

1761
01:59:06,185 --> 01:59:09,508
[SPEAKER_14]: The very, very bare minimum.

1762
01:59:10,915 --> 01:59:17,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to support the pool because I'm tired of the bare minimum.

1763
01:59:18,737 --> 01:59:22,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been around a long, long time in the disability.

1764
01:59:22,219 --> 01:59:37,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, by the way, I'm also a member of the Disability Consortium, one of the biggest lobbying groups in the country, an association of philanthropists who give money to disability programs all over the thing.

1765
01:59:37,951 --> 01:59:40,392
[SPEAKER_14]: But of course, I don't represent disabled people.

1766
01:59:40,772 --> 01:59:41,993
[SPEAKER_14]: I never said I did.

1767
01:59:42,153 --> 01:59:45,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, I get elected every four years.

1768
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:56,489
[SPEAKER_14]: And my brethren elect me, including the president of this council, elect me chairman of a committee on the Democratic Party for those Republicans.

1769
01:59:56,809 --> 01:59:59,192
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry that you're not Democrats.

1770
02:00:00,553 --> 02:00:07,239
[SPEAKER_14]: But maybe I should give all that up, because I don't represent the disabled community.

1771
02:00:08,490 --> 02:00:10,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I probably don't.

1772
02:00:10,992 --> 02:00:24,682
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's an interesting point, because there's so many splinter groups that politicians who keep their jobs by saying they represent us, when in fact, don't.

1773
02:00:25,683 --> 02:00:27,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I never go after people.

1774
02:00:28,185 --> 02:00:29,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I go after issues.

1775
02:00:30,727 --> 02:00:36,091
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think there are at least three or four of you in here who know that's the way I work.

1776
02:00:37,728 --> 02:00:47,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I get tired of having to fight to get the fact that I am not a third class citizen.

1777
02:00:47,317 --> 02:00:50,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Title IX made me a third class citizen, by the way.

1778
02:00:51,361 --> 02:00:59,850
[SPEAKER_14]: But I support Title IX as strongly as I support disability rights, as strongly as I support civil and human rights.

1779
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:12,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you think that, other than the council, that somebody would offer to put me on one of the committees, like the swimming pool committee?

1780
02:01:14,069 --> 02:01:14,309
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1781
02:01:14,950 --> 02:01:21,875
[SPEAKER_14]: For the same reason they might not put some of you on, because I ask hard questions.

1782
02:01:22,535 --> 02:01:30,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And the hard question here tonight, and in your thing, is which priority is better?

1783
02:01:31,445 --> 02:01:33,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it the fire station?

1784
02:01:34,566 --> 02:01:38,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it the women needs in the police station?

1785
02:01:38,908 --> 02:01:40,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Or is it the swimming pool?

1786
02:01:40,789 --> 02:01:43,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I'm going to say one last thing.

1787
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:45,011
[SPEAKER_14]: I like all of you.

1788
02:01:45,291 --> 02:01:46,831
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't dislike you.

1789
02:01:46,971 --> 02:01:51,593
[SPEAKER_14]: And I like the mayor, even though I come to some of your times.

1790
02:01:52,013 --> 02:01:57,336
[SPEAKER_14]: But I guess from now on, since I don't represent anybody,

1791
02:02:00,519 --> 02:02:06,282
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll speak only on one issue, and that will be the one issue I'll speak on.

1792
02:02:06,662 --> 02:02:15,907
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna write a letter to all the people I give money to and tell them that the city administration does not believe I should be given the money.

1793
02:02:16,947 --> 02:02:24,191
[SPEAKER_14]: The city administration thinks not enough of me to even ask me to sit on a committee.

1794
02:02:25,427 --> 02:02:28,510
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a shame for the disabled community.

1795
02:02:28,971 --> 02:02:46,609
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, I'm probably one of the few people in the country that have a PhD in disability rights because of the work I've done in the past and sitting on committees in LBJs, from LBJ to Jimmy Carter

1796
02:02:47,952 --> 02:02:49,473
[SPEAKER_14]: administration on these issues.

1797
02:02:49,733 --> 02:03:06,544
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thank you for giving me a moment to sit down and reflect on all my work that goes down the drain because my administration, my democratic administration, don't want to do the right thing.

1798
02:03:07,425 --> 02:03:12,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is make that pool really accessible for more people.

1799
02:03:12,988 --> 02:03:15,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Hence, I ask you tonight,

1800
02:03:16,684 --> 02:03:25,966
[SPEAKER_14]: to consider working with them hard, and if they won't do it, well, you're the guys who've got to say yes or no.

1801
02:03:26,707 --> 02:03:29,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Put the vote where your heart really is.

1802
02:03:29,727 --> 02:03:31,608
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's with the pool, vote for it.

1803
02:03:32,088 --> 02:03:34,468
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's against the money, vote for that.

1804
02:03:35,009 --> 02:03:38,409
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to make that decision for you, nor am I going to try to.

1805
02:03:38,690 --> 02:03:42,991
[SPEAKER_14]: And as Mr. Majorca tells me when I chair a meeting, get off the podium.

1806
02:03:43,991 --> 02:03:44,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1807
02:03:44,895 --> 02:03:45,235
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

1808
02:03:45,315 --> 02:03:47,657
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Council Penta, the committee report be adopted.

1809
02:03:48,178 --> 02:03:48,878
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1810
02:03:49,539 --> 02:03:50,219
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

1811
02:03:50,259 --> 02:03:51,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Committee report is adopted.

1812
02:03:51,821 --> 02:03:54,963
[SPEAKER_03]: That's along with the two resolutions, Mr. Clerk, that are going to go with that paper.

1813
02:03:55,924 --> 02:03:58,046
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Council Penta, revert back to regular business.

1814
02:03:58,086 --> 02:03:58,586
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

1815
02:03:58,606 --> 02:03:59,227
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

1816
02:03:59,867 --> 02:04:02,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Page two, petitions, presentations, and similar papers.

1817
02:04:02,349 --> 02:04:13,839
[SPEAKER_03]: 2013-505, petition for a taxi owner license, licenses for two taxis by Joseph O. Pierre, Citywide Taxi, Inc.

1818
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:31,008

1827
02:04:56,131 --> 02:04:56,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1828
02:04:56,551 --> 02:04:57,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor marks.

1829
02:04:58,913 --> 02:04:59,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Question.

1830
02:04:59,733 --> 02:05:02,155
[SPEAKER_17]: So is this your first owner's license and method?

1831
02:05:03,956 --> 02:05:04,917
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my tweet.

1832
02:05:06,192 --> 02:05:09,614
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's your first, you've never had an owner's license before in the city.

1833
02:05:09,834 --> 02:05:11,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you driven in the city before?

1834
02:05:12,095 --> 02:05:12,295
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1835
02:05:12,935 --> 02:05:18,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Mr. Clark has a, go ahead.

1836
02:05:19,438 --> 02:05:22,200
[SPEAKER_17]: He has an owner's license now, currently.

1837
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:24,281
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is the addition?

1838
02:05:24,761 --> 02:05:25,161
[SPEAKER_17]: Two and three.

1839
02:05:27,574 --> 02:05:30,935
[SPEAKER_05]: He petitioned in February.

1840
02:05:31,015 --> 02:05:37,016
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not have plates available then, so we got him on the one calf.

1841
02:05:37,656 --> 02:05:39,536
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look at the list, he's always been pending.

1842
02:05:39,756 --> 02:05:41,797
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we've completed the pending.

1843
02:05:42,677 --> 02:05:45,297
[SPEAKER_17]: So where does that lead us now with the number of ono?

1844
02:05:46,578 --> 02:05:51,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, we've dropped down to about, I think, prior to report.

1845
02:05:57,937 --> 02:06:01,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have, including, if I include these two, we have 43 active.

1846
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:01,920
[SPEAKER_05]: 43 active.

1847
02:06:03,742 --> 02:06:11,389
[SPEAKER_05]: So we actually dropped two from the last count.

1848
02:06:13,190 --> 02:06:17,634
[SPEAKER_17]: And where are you going to be operating out of?

1849
02:06:17,654 --> 02:06:20,477
[SPEAKER_13]: 40 Canal Street in Medford.

1850
02:06:20,497 --> 02:06:20,917
[SPEAKER_17]: 40 Canal Street?

1851
02:06:20,937 --> 02:06:21,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1852
02:06:22,642 --> 02:06:27,287
[SPEAKER_17]: And I assume you're gonna hire, you're gonna look to hire people to drive these cabs?

1853
02:06:27,947 --> 02:06:33,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I'm doing that right now, doing advertising, and hopefully to get a driver.

1854
02:06:35,095 --> 02:06:37,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Roughly how many drivers would you need to have to?

1855
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:41,982
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a yard in there running right now.

1856
02:06:42,142 --> 02:06:43,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking for two drivers.

1857
02:06:44,144 --> 02:06:44,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Two drivers?

1858
02:06:47,718 --> 02:06:54,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I've, in the past several weeks, not voted for operator licenses.

1859
02:06:54,902 --> 02:07:05,447
[SPEAKER_17]: The owner licenses I will support, and as soon as the magic number of 50, or if we plan on reducing it, is met, then I think that issue will be resolved.

1860
02:07:06,247 --> 02:07:09,669
[SPEAKER_17]: However, the operator license right now I will not support.

1861
02:07:10,229 --> 02:07:12,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, but this gentleman is not asking for an operator license.

1862
02:07:12,311 --> 02:07:13,832
[SPEAKER_17]: You're asking for an owner's license.

1863
02:07:14,612 --> 02:07:23,819
[SPEAKER_17]: And until we get a new ordinance on the, on the board, uh, and look at the application form that's in front of us.

1864
02:07:23,879 --> 02:07:31,925
[SPEAKER_17]: So, uh, we can tackle the issues that, uh, have been confronting this community with, uh, taxi operators operating outside of the community.

1865
02:07:32,646 --> 02:07:36,669
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so I will support this here tonight, uh, for the taxi owner license.

1866
02:07:37,774 --> 02:07:40,055
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion for approval, Councilor Caraviello.

1867
02:07:40,455 --> 02:07:41,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1868
02:07:41,275 --> 02:07:47,676
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought we were going to hold up on the owner licenses.

1869
02:07:49,397 --> 02:07:50,417
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought that was the owners.

1870
02:07:53,038 --> 02:07:55,318
[SPEAKER_03]: He petitioned several months ago for these.

1871
02:07:55,578 --> 02:07:57,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the 45.

1872
02:07:57,999 --> 02:07:58,719
[SPEAKER_05]: He was part of the 45.

1873
02:07:58,899 --> 02:08:01,440
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it was pending.

1874
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:02,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Why didn't he get his before?

1875
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:05,021
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have plates available.

1876
02:08:05,041 --> 02:08:05,861
[SPEAKER_16]: We didn't have plates for him.

1877
02:08:06,343 --> 02:08:08,083
[SPEAKER_05]: place available now.

1878
02:08:08,284 --> 02:08:10,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, now the plates are available for him.

1879
02:08:10,124 --> 02:08:10,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1880
02:08:10,404 --> 02:08:19,867
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we, now we have dropped two in the most recent week because of choosing not to renew the license.

1881
02:08:20,167 --> 02:08:22,527
[SPEAKER_16]: I will, I will support it only because he's been waiting.

1882
02:08:22,587 --> 02:08:23,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Then I didn't know that.

1883
02:08:24,368 --> 02:08:26,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I did drive by 40 Canal Street.

1884
02:08:27,369 --> 02:08:28,609
[SPEAKER_16]: I see a sign on the fence there.

1885
02:08:29,309 --> 02:08:30,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Where is your office in there?

1886
02:08:31,470 --> 02:08:32,710
[SPEAKER_13]: The office under there in the back.

1887
02:08:33,553 --> 02:08:35,574
[SPEAKER_16]: We're in the back, I know there's a building.

1888
02:08:35,614 --> 02:08:37,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Just speak into the mic, just speak into the mic.

1889
02:08:37,495 --> 02:08:40,157
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there's a building in the back there, do you have an office in that building?

1890
02:08:40,817 --> 02:08:41,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1891
02:08:41,517 --> 02:08:41,898
[SPEAKER_13]: You do.

1892
02:08:41,958 --> 02:08:43,038
[SPEAKER_13]: You go down in the right.

1893
02:08:43,098 --> 02:08:44,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I know there's.

1894
02:08:45,099 --> 02:08:46,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Office trailer down there.

1895
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:47,401
[SPEAKER_16]: There's what down there?

1896
02:08:47,661 --> 02:08:50,262
[SPEAKER_13]: I got office trailer where those camps back in.

1897
02:08:50,342 --> 02:08:51,203
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a trailer down there?

1898
02:08:51,323 --> 02:08:54,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, office trailer.

1899
02:08:54,965 --> 02:08:58,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'll go by this and I'll take a look at myself, but I've seen the sign there.

1900
02:08:59,387 --> 02:09:00,428
[SPEAKER_00]: To the chair.

1901
02:09:01,668 --> 02:09:02,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Councilor Longo-Kurt.

1902
02:09:03,188 --> 02:09:05,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Clerk Finn, were you able to go to the location?

1903
02:09:06,530 --> 02:09:10,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he has a trail office, similar to what the car dealers have.

1904
02:09:11,774 --> 02:09:12,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Fully functional office.

1905
02:09:13,816 --> 02:09:16,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he has actually another business there.

1906
02:09:16,518 --> 02:09:20,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's a towing company too.

1907
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:22,982
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there's a roofing company, but I know there's some other businesses back there.

1908
02:09:23,022 --> 02:09:25,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's a mogul, he's got another business.

1909
02:09:25,444 --> 02:09:25,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1910
02:09:27,025 --> 02:09:29,327
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval, Councilor Penta.

1911
02:09:29,347 --> 02:09:30,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at,

1912
02:09:33,444 --> 02:09:34,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Joseph Pierre.

1913
02:09:34,225 --> 02:09:39,689
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Joseph O. Well, there's a Joseph F. Then there's a Joseph F. Who's Joseph F?

1914
02:09:39,729 --> 02:09:40,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that your brother?

1915
02:09:40,329 --> 02:09:40,850
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not him.

1916
02:09:40,870 --> 02:09:44,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Joseph O. No, he's Joseph O. Joseph O. Pierre.

1917
02:09:44,573 --> 02:09:47,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I get a page here from the Sailor of Weights and Measures.

1918
02:09:47,535 --> 02:09:48,956
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unsigned and undated.

1919
02:09:50,217 --> 02:09:56,342
[SPEAKER_07]: As a matter of fact, both of his pages are unsigned and undated.

1920
02:09:57,503 --> 02:09:58,223
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been approved?

1921
02:09:58,664 --> 02:10:00,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clark, they're unsigned and undated.

1922
02:10:01,175 --> 02:10:06,098
[SPEAKER_05]: You have certificates of registration here.

1923
02:10:06,138 --> 02:10:08,859
[SPEAKER_05]: One is called Citywide Taxi, 194 Harvard Street.

1924
02:10:08,899 --> 02:10:12,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Another one, All-Country Transportation, 194 Harvard Street.

1925
02:10:31,107 --> 02:10:32,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You're using Friday Canal Street.

1926
02:10:33,248 --> 02:10:34,069
[SPEAKER_07]: What's Harvard Street?

1927
02:10:35,730 --> 02:10:38,992
[SPEAKER_13]: All County Trends, that's my company.

1928
02:10:39,513 --> 02:10:40,733
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your company?

1929
02:10:41,154 --> 02:10:41,994
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my company.

1930
02:10:42,094 --> 02:10:49,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Before, I was doing Citywide operated by All County Trends.

1931
02:10:50,860 --> 02:10:52,041
[SPEAKER_07]: You have two different names.

1932
02:10:54,142 --> 02:10:55,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Two different corporations.

1933
02:10:57,179 --> 02:10:58,500
[SPEAKER_07]: You have two different corporations?

1934
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:01,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, which is Citywide Taxi, Inc.

1935
02:11:02,403 --> 02:11:03,384
[SPEAKER_13]: and All County Transportation, Inc.

1936
02:11:05,245 --> 02:11:06,806
[SPEAKER_07]: All County Transportation, Inc.

1937
02:11:06,946 --> 02:11:09,628
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one cab under All County Transportation.

1938
02:11:12,090 --> 02:11:13,631
[SPEAKER_07]: You have one cab already right now.

1939
02:11:14,232 --> 02:11:15,553
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the name of that cab company?

1940
02:11:16,473 --> 02:11:18,035
[SPEAKER_13]: It's under Citywide Taxi.

1941
02:11:18,975 --> 02:11:20,476
[SPEAKER_13]: The two applications are important.

1942
02:11:21,297 --> 02:11:23,799
[SPEAKER_13]: One under All County Transportation.

1943
02:11:24,711 --> 02:11:25,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand this.

1944
02:11:25,532 --> 02:11:30,176
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want three cabs, why do you have two different cab company names?

1945
02:11:32,698 --> 02:11:36,141
[SPEAKER_13]: I have, because I have $10,000 with the state treasury.

1946
02:11:36,842 --> 02:11:41,946
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's when I was waiting for the consular year.

1947
02:11:42,426 --> 02:11:45,089
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm paying insurance, which is $600 a month.

1948
02:11:45,769 --> 02:11:49,272
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm waiting at the same time.

1949
02:11:49,553 --> 02:11:52,275
[SPEAKER_07]: How could you be paying $600 a month if you didn't get the license?

1950
02:11:53,666 --> 02:11:54,586
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, for the insurance.

1951
02:11:55,807 --> 02:11:56,267
[SPEAKER_07]: The insurance?

1952
02:11:56,507 --> 02:11:56,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1953
02:11:57,348 --> 02:11:58,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Insurance for what?

1954
02:11:59,108 --> 02:12:01,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Insurance, insured the cab.

1955
02:12:01,790 --> 02:12:03,210
[SPEAKER_07]: You paid $7,200 a year?

1956
02:12:03,230 --> 02:12:04,771
[SPEAKER_07]: $7,200 a year, that's what you pay for insurance?

1957
02:12:04,811 --> 02:12:05,712
[SPEAKER_13]: They go up to $10,000.

1958
02:12:06,112 --> 02:12:07,592
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't have a cab license.

1959
02:12:07,632 --> 02:12:08,673
[SPEAKER_07]: How could you be paying that?

1960
02:12:08,953 --> 02:12:09,933
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good question.

1961
02:12:10,094 --> 02:12:10,454
[SPEAKER_13]: You see.

1962
02:12:13,975 --> 02:12:15,456
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information.

1963
02:12:15,676 --> 02:12:16,997
[SPEAKER_16]: It says here you're self-insured.

1964
02:12:17,017 --> 02:12:18,757
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see a certificate.

1965
02:12:18,817 --> 02:12:20,578
[SPEAKER_13]: I have self-insurance right now.

1966
02:12:20,598 --> 02:12:21,919
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see a certificate of insurance here.

1967
02:12:22,443 --> 02:12:29,687
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why it's $10,000 I put with the state treasury to become self-insured.

1968
02:12:31,128 --> 02:12:32,868
[SPEAKER_16]: How did you get a registration with an insurance company?

1969
02:12:34,589 --> 02:12:35,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Do they make you put up $10,000?

1970
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:42,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you got to put $10,000 with the state treasury and when I split the price.

1971
02:12:43,974 --> 02:12:48,477
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I don't see a certificate of insurance here.

1972
02:12:48,617 --> 02:12:51,038
[SPEAKER_16]: I never heard of a transportation company being self-insured.

1973
02:12:51,937 --> 02:12:54,298
[SPEAKER_07]: You are self-insured $10,000 for each car.

1974
02:12:54,438 --> 02:12:55,118
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you're saying?

1975
02:12:55,698 --> 02:12:57,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, most of the cabins are self-insured.

1976
02:12:57,819 --> 02:12:59,620
[SPEAKER_07]: You put $20,000 up to insure two cars.

1977
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:00,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1978
02:13:02,541 --> 02:13:04,182
[SPEAKER_07]: You just got through saying you're paying $600 a month.

1979
02:13:04,202 --> 02:13:04,262
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1980
02:13:04,322 --> 02:13:04,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Current insurance.

1981
02:13:05,142 --> 02:13:08,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Liability insurance.

1982
02:13:09,184 --> 02:13:10,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, all county insurance.

1983
02:13:11,785 --> 02:13:18,467
[SPEAKER_13]: When I'm waiting for the city, when I'm waiting for the city, I open the insurance with Lighthouse Insurance.

1984
02:13:19,187 --> 02:13:20,428
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I'm paying before.

1985
02:13:21,252 --> 02:13:27,973
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, when I see I'm waiting, I can give the license here, and I transfer it to the $10,000 bond.

1986
02:13:27,993 --> 02:13:28,453
[SPEAKER_13]: The $10,000 bond?

1987
02:13:28,474 --> 02:13:28,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1988
02:13:28,694 --> 02:13:29,214
[SPEAKER_13]: The $10,000 is the bond.

1989
02:13:29,234 --> 02:13:31,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Did the city make you put up a $10,000 bond?

1990
02:13:31,434 --> 02:13:35,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, is that a, did the city make him put up a $10,000 bond?

1991
02:13:35,115 --> 02:13:35,395
[SPEAKER_10]: For each guy?

1992
02:13:35,415 --> 02:13:35,515
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

1993
02:13:35,535 --> 02:13:36,215
[SPEAKER_16]: So the state, I'm not gonna,

1994
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:54,382
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never seen a self-insured car company before.

1995
02:13:54,442 --> 02:13:56,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Is your other taxi self-insured too?

1996
02:13:57,103 --> 02:14:00,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, most of the companies that do it like that.

1997
02:14:00,365 --> 02:14:03,946
[SPEAKER_13]: You got another liability, $13,000, all in Boston.

1998
02:14:04,547 --> 02:14:06,368
[SPEAKER_13]: $13,000 and she lost it.

1999
02:14:06,468 --> 02:14:13,531
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I was to get into your cab and you got in an accident and I died, the most I can get is $10,000, right?

2000
02:14:13,551 --> 02:14:13,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

2001
02:14:16,933 --> 02:14:17,713
[SPEAKER_16]: The lawyer says yes.

2002
02:14:17,733 --> 02:14:19,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that what you're saying?

2003
02:14:20,154 --> 02:14:20,915
[SPEAKER_13]: $10,000, but.

2004
02:14:21,435 --> 02:14:25,377
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I was getting in your cab tonight and we crashed and I died, I can only get $10,000?

2005
02:14:25,437 --> 02:14:25,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2006
02:14:25,617 --> 02:14:31,501
[SPEAKER_16]: The law requires me, I do the same business as you do.

2007
02:14:31,741 --> 02:14:33,462
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to have a million and a half dollar policy.

2008
02:14:34,883 --> 02:14:39,446
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a million and a half dollars worth of insurance on each vehicle I own.

2009
02:14:40,727 --> 02:14:41,948
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you getting away with $10,000?

2010
02:14:41,988 --> 02:14:46,090
[SPEAKER_16]: You better ask him, Ricky, maybe he gets screwed.

2011
02:14:46,430 --> 02:14:47,311
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm doing something wrong here.

2012
02:14:49,212 --> 02:14:50,693
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a million and a half dollars.

2013
02:14:50,773 --> 02:14:52,334
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm forced to have a million and a half dollars.

2014
02:14:53,675 --> 02:14:56,336
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm doing something wrong, I guess.

2015
02:14:57,337 --> 02:15:00,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to Mr. Pierre after the meeting.

2016
02:15:00,859 --> 02:15:08,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't possibly can believe that you need two more cabs to operate in the city.

2017
02:15:08,503 --> 02:15:09,163
[SPEAKER_07]: You already have one.

2018
02:15:09,223 --> 02:15:10,444
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 44 cabs.

2019
02:15:11,504 --> 02:15:13,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I just cannot believe there is no

2020
02:15:15,354 --> 02:15:18,476
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no business out there for 44 cabs in this city.

2021
02:15:19,617 --> 02:15:20,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't understand this.

2022
02:15:21,278 --> 02:15:24,641
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a determination made by the marketplace.

2023
02:15:25,701 --> 02:15:26,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

2024
02:15:26,502 --> 02:15:28,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I can't support this without a certificate of insurance.

2025
02:15:28,943 --> 02:15:29,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't support it either.

2026
02:15:29,844 --> 02:15:33,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you're from a court or what, but I can't support it because I just think this is completely out of control.

2027
02:15:35,023 --> 02:15:36,064
[SPEAKER_07]: All of it's out of control.

2028
02:15:36,524 --> 02:15:38,585
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't even have your own certificate of insurance.

2029
02:15:38,845 --> 02:15:40,006
[SPEAKER_07]: You write self-insured.

2030
02:15:40,246 --> 02:15:48,291
[SPEAKER_07]: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts tells you you have to have a stamped self-insured certificate when you're using the term self-insured.

2031
02:15:48,311 --> 02:15:51,273
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, on the motion for approval.

2032
02:15:52,054 --> 02:15:52,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call.

2033
02:15:52,514 --> 02:15:53,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call has been requested.

2034
02:15:53,534 --> 02:15:54,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Call the roll, Mr. Clerk.

2035
02:15:57,857 --> 02:15:58,658

2036
02:15:58,858 --> 02:15:59,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2037
02:15:59,538 --> 02:16:00,259

2038
02:16:00,439 --> 02:16:00,599
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2039
02:16:01,219 --> 02:16:02,140

02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:02,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

2043
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:06,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2044
02:16:06,561 --> 02:16:07,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Penta?

2045
02:16:07,041 --> 02:16:07,141
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2046
02:16:07,241 --> 02:16:08,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Mayorkas?

2047
02:16:08,341 --> 02:16:10,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and a vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

2048
02:16:10,202 --> 02:16:11,002
[SPEAKER_03]: The paper is approved.

2049
02:16:11,022 --> 02:16:18,806
[SPEAKER_03]: 2013-506, this is a petition for taxi operator license by Joseph F. Pierre.

2050
02:16:18,826 --> 02:16:23,488
[SPEAKER_03]: 268 Pot House Road, Boulevard, Somerville, Mass.

[SPEAKER_03]: On files of court report, Mr. Joseph F. Pierre, here.

2053
02:16:30,931 --> 02:16:34,172
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion to Councilor Camuso, the table.

2054
02:16:34,847 --> 02:16:35,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Not here.

2055
02:16:36,228 --> 02:16:36,748
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not you.

2056
02:16:37,608 --> 02:16:38,028
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not him.

2057
02:16:38,068 --> 02:16:42,690
[SPEAKER_03]: He's Joseph O. On the motion, the paper table, all those in favor, all those opposed, that paper is tabled.

2058
02:16:43,350 --> 02:16:45,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Communications from the mayor, 2013, 5 0 7.

2059
02:16:47,192 --> 02:17:01,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, mayor writes to Mr. President, councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body confirmed the reappointment of W Warren Ramirez of 15 Pinkham street, Pinkham street as commissioner of trust funds for truly as Michael Jacob, the mayor,

[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion to approve, Vice President Dello Russo.

2061
02:17:05,599 --> 02:17:17,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, this gentleman, whose resume we've seen in the past, is a great citizen, a great patriot, and a great financier.

2062
02:17:18,801 --> 02:17:21,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I second the approval offered by Councilor Pinto.

2063
02:17:27,443 --> 02:17:30,024
[SPEAKER_07]: That Mr. Ramirez be invited down, who was a wonderful asset,

2064
02:17:30,635 --> 02:17:33,436
[SPEAKER_07]: at the Brookline Bank and he just retired.

2065
02:17:33,516 --> 02:17:38,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'd be nice to have the people take a look and see and have him give us his resume.

2066
02:17:39,559 --> 02:17:40,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a motion for approval, isn't it?

2067
02:17:41,740 --> 02:17:42,500
[SPEAKER_03]: And ask him to come down?

2068
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:42,800

[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, all those in favor.

2072
02:17:53,328 --> 02:18:00,611
[SPEAKER_09]: By point of information, remind the counselors that we have in the past been in receipt of his resume.

02:18:01,332 --> 02:18:01,512

2074
02:18:02,432 --> 02:18:03,112

[SPEAKER_03]: Warren Ramirez is reappointed.

2078
02:18:08,135 --> 02:18:08,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Records.

2079
02:18:08,795 --> 02:18:11,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, Mr. President.

2080
02:18:12,717 --> 02:18:13,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Two papers.

2081
02:18:13,277 --> 02:18:13,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

2082
02:18:15,098 --> 02:18:15,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta.

2083
02:18:16,098 --> 02:18:16,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Two papers.

2084
02:18:16,598 --> 02:18:16,618
[SPEAKER_07]: 13-449.

2085
02:18:18,786 --> 02:18:20,507
[SPEAKER_07]: It was laid in the table on the 14th.

2086
02:18:21,868 --> 02:18:25,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, DPW parks department and Hormel commission.

2087
02:18:25,790 --> 02:18:26,830
[SPEAKER_07]: We get a report back on that.

2088
02:18:26,850 --> 02:18:28,631
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the table.

2089
02:18:29,151 --> 02:18:30,652
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but he laid it for one week.

2090
02:18:30,892 --> 02:18:32,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was councilor Camuso.

2091
02:18:32,313 --> 02:18:33,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was, you want to take it from the table?

2092
02:18:34,134 --> 02:18:35,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2093
02:18:35,314 --> 02:18:38,656
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of councilor Camuso, the maker of the motion paper, you take him to the table.

2094
02:18:39,156 --> 02:18:43,459
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 2013 four 49, uh, on the motion of the paper, you take him to the table.

2095
02:18:43,499 --> 02:18:46,160
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor, all those opposed papers before the,

2096
02:18:47,455 --> 02:18:48,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Council, what is this regarding?

2097
02:18:48,896 --> 02:18:49,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2098
02:18:49,757 --> 02:18:54,962
[SPEAKER_02]: As we're all aware, Hormel Stadium was recently updated with the track facility.

2099
02:18:55,442 --> 02:19:05,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And the senior citizens that do the walking club in the morning at the Meadow Glen Mall, they want to have the track opened up so that they can do it outdoors now that the weather's getting better.

2100
02:19:05,832 --> 02:19:12,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the staffing levels at the DPW, they should be able to accommodate this, at least during the working business hours.

2101
02:19:14,042 --> 02:19:15,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it open for walking?

2102
02:19:15,303 --> 02:19:18,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It's open, only set a couple of hours a day.

2103
02:19:18,745 --> 02:19:20,025
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's no reason why it can't be.

2104
02:19:21,026 --> 02:19:22,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't it be open all the time?

2105
02:19:22,147 --> 02:19:22,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand that.

2106
02:19:23,207 --> 02:19:24,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least during the business day.

2107
02:19:24,928 --> 02:19:26,589
[SPEAKER_02]: The DPW works until 4 o'clock.

2108
02:19:27,410 --> 02:19:29,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't they be open, like, on Saturday and Sunday when they go?

2109
02:19:29,391 --> 02:19:29,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be.

2110
02:19:30,191 --> 02:19:30,972
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm asking for.

2111
02:19:31,052 --> 02:19:32,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it should be open all the time.

2112
02:19:32,432 --> 02:19:33,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2113
02:19:33,533 --> 02:19:37,655
[SPEAKER_03]: On that motion that the Hormel track for walking be open 24 hours.

2114
02:19:37,695 --> 02:19:40,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not 24 hours, because you have to worry about vandalism and stuff, but.
