00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to know, what are the two programs that most of the students are enrolled in?

27
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:34,882
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know that it's just two programs.

28
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:40,124
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have a specific breakdown of which programs can certainly look into that for you.

29
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:41,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Milestones.

30
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:41,965
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that correct?

31
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:42,605
[SPEAKER_19]: Milestones?

32
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,986
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Minuteman Regional High School.

33
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:45,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Minuteman.

34
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:46,547
[SPEAKER_11]: The out-of-district.

35
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:49,889
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Belson, did you want to say?

36
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:50,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Minuteman?

37
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:51,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking at Minuteman or Milestones?

38
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:52,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Minuteman.

39
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,190
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

40
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:58,652
[SPEAKER_01]: So Minuteman is a vocational technical Chapter 74 program.

41
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:01,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the payments are grouped.

42
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the instance on the 63, is that what you're asking?

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the 63 and the 25.

44
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:12,984
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that was, what do you call it, a payment that was- He's inquiring what specific Chapter 74 program they're enrolled in.

45
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:13,784
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have that.

46
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:19,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know, of this program, what is the one that most of the students are enrolled in?

47
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:19,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Plumbing.

48
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:19,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it plumbing?

49
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:20,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

50
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:21,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Plumbing still?

51
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:22,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, not really.

52
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:23,829
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changed.

53
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:28,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they have a lot of kids in horticulture, believe it or not.

54
00:02:29,812 --> 00:02:31,813
[SPEAKER_01]: By next year, they're likely to have two or three kids.

55
00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:32,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

56
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:34,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's really going down.

57
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,873
[SPEAKER_01]: It went down from 50 kids.

58
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:38,474
[SPEAKER_11]: How many kids do we have currently in the program?

59
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:39,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably what, three or four?

60
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:42,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven right now, maybe?

61
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:44,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Six or seven at minimum.

62
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:44,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Nine.

63
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:47,276

[SPEAKER_17]: No, Essex is separate.

65
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:49,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, all right.

66
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:53,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you just give me a breakdown of the program when you have time?

67
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:53,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly.

68
00:02:53,678 --> 00:02:55,338

112
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:29,515
[SPEAKER_12]: We're here to promote our event that we're running in Medford this year, which is the One Mission Buzz Off.

113
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:31,876
[SPEAKER_12]: It started about five years ago.

114
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,858
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a student at McGlynn who passed away of cancer, a third grader.

115
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:40,398
[SPEAKER_12]: And it started off as a few teachers going to Gillette Stadium every year to buzz their heads in his remembrance.

116
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:47,765
[SPEAKER_12]: And last year was the first year that we decided to host our own fundraiser for it before we traveled up to Gillette.

117
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:50,156
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a really successful fundraiser.

118
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:54,079
[SPEAKER_12]: We set a goal for $3,000, and we raised over seven.

119
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,821
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had a lot of community participation.

120
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,262
[SPEAKER_12]: We had over 100 people attend.

121
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:05,806
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were really excited, and we thought this year it would be great to actually host a community buzz off ourselves.

122
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:11,470
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're not only going to host our own fundraiser in Mefford, we're also going to actually be buzzing that day.

123
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,993
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've had our team grow from year one of four people going

128
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,680
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know we're really excited about the community participation.

129
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:06,205
[SPEAKER_12]: This year we were able to have the police and the fire presidents of the union have a contest of who could raise more money between the fire station and the police station to help us raise money for our event.

130
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:09,707
[SPEAKER_12]: we couldn't be more excited to have the community involved.

00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:13,742
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's fantastic.

157
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:21,226
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think I saw it already posted on Facebook with the blog, and I continue to share it once it gets closer.

158
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:22,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, absolutely.

159
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:27,570
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been a lot of the schools have been promoting it on their parent-teacher group pages and so on.

160
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,491
[SPEAKER_12]: We're anticipating a lot of people, and we're pretty excited about what the turnout will look like.

161
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:33,933
[SPEAKER_24]: I know you want that.

162
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:37,736
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to let people know they can still join the team.

163
00:07:39,617 --> 00:07:48,485
[SPEAKER_24]: You can sign up that day, make a donation, get your head shaved that day, or you can join the team online at buzzforkids.org.

164
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:52,228
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually join the team, and then you can solicit donations through the website.

165
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:55,590
[SPEAKER_24]: If there is anybody watching that wants to donate,

166
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:16,168
[SPEAKER_24]: online that can't go is buzzforkids.org and just search team emo and you can donate directly to the team and we do you can still sign up you can join that day we have teachers, board and commission members, we have cops, firemen,

167
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,400
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we have DPW guy.

168
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,840
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't have elected officials yet.

169
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:26,683
[SPEAKER_24]: We have women on the team.

170
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:28,704
[SPEAKER_24]: We have three women on the team this year.

171
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:32,226
[SPEAKER_24]: We have three women who are buzzing their heads so far.

172
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:33,826
[SPEAKER_24]: Just saying.

173
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:39,449
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's going to be periodic.

174
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:40,410
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to be periodic.

175
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:55,251
[SPEAKER_24]: Between 8, 830, I know the firefighters, I think, have said they're going to be coming in throughout the night, getting their head shaved, some of the cops as well.

176
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:01,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Periodically throughout the night, I think you'll see.

177
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:03,215
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to try to spread it out.

178
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:04,995
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to be a really fun event.

179
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,696
[SPEAKER_24]: We had a really great time last year.

180
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:12,305
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, Anthony's been doing this for a couple years now.

181
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,446
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just his goal to us to do this.

182
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:17,168
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, our goal is to make it bigger and bigger and bigger.

183
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:20,551
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, eventually just, you know, an all day affair one day, hopefully.

184
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:25,434
[SPEAKER_24]: And you guys in the City Council have been excellent.

185
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:30,078
[SPEAKER_24]: John Brewer's Tavern has been awesome in helping us with this.

186
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:32,119
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're really looking forward to this.

187
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,341
[SPEAKER_24]: We're looking to, you know, we set a goal of 10,000.

188
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Hopefully we beat that.

189
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:55,548
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just wondering how many people buzzed their heads last year and what's your goal for this year?

190
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:59,732
[SPEAKER_12]: So last year I think we had about seven or eight people on our team buzz.

191
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:00,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Our team was over like

192
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:02,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, maybe 10, somewhere around there, yeah.

193
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:23,948
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think you have a set amount of money you have to raise as an individual when you do a community buzz off.

194
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:28,950
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's just all the money that's raised through the community goes to the actual charity.

195
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,112
[SPEAKER_24]: So we can be a little looser on what people actually have to raise to participate.

196
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, last year we raised, as a team, when it was all said and done, about $35,000.

197
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:44,919
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're hoping to kind of get within the same ballpark, you know, hosting our own event this year, as opposed to just going to Gillette that day.

198
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,640
[SPEAKER_12]: So, kind of new ground for us.

199
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,505
[SPEAKER_18]: So will you guys get buzzed at John Brewer's, or wait and get buzzed at Gillette?

200
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:53,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we're all going to just do it at John Brewer's that night, yeah.

201
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,903
[SPEAKER_12]: So the actual buzz off is the next day at Gillette Stadium, but we're going to do it the day before, yeah.

202
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:05,586
[SPEAKER_12]: So one mission's been great in sending us all the stuff that we need, t-shirts and banners and everything else that we're going to be decorating that night.

203
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:06,967
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're excited.

204
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:09,248
[SPEAKER_12]: We're really excited to try something new and see how it goes.

205
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:11,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.

206
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,091
[SPEAKER_19]: Go team BMO.

207
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:13,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

208
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:14,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for taking the time.

209
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:14,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

210
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:15,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

211
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:15,832
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll see you there.

212
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:35,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, while we're into suspension, community participation, we were supposed to have Sean Driscoll Gomez from CCSR, but I believe he is receiving an award tonight up at the high school, so we have three individuals that we'll be presenting.

213
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,575
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the Orchid Project.

214
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:44,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Your name and address, please, for our record.

215
00:11:45,478 --> 00:11:46,559
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Kaylee Boulay.

216
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:49,862
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Emily Gatti.

217
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:52,108
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Parviti Rana.

218
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:53,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

219
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and school committee members.

220
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:02,336
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Kaylee Boulay and I'm here with Parviti Rana and Emily Gotti.

221
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:08,661
[SPEAKER_08]: We are students in the ninth grade at Medford High School and we would like to present our CCSR project to you.

222
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:14,466
[SPEAKER_08]: CCSR, also known as Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility,

223
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:19,117
[SPEAKER_08]: is a group that creates projects that work toward helping others and the environment.

224
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:27,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Our project is known as One Sapling at a Time, and we are here today to ask for your permission to create a fruit orchard on the Medford High Campus.

225
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Good afternoon once again.

226
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:43,307
[SPEAKER_07]: As determined ninth grade students, we strive to achieve our goals to make a community a better place,

227
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:52,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Our project, as you heard, is titled One Sapling at a Time, and we would essentially like to place an orchard in the back of the Medford High campus.

228
00:12:53,029 --> 00:13:03,136
[SPEAKER_07]: We would specifically like the trees to be placed on the hill outside of the community school's entrance, which if you see in the packet you have received, it's on the second page.

229
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:09,660
[SPEAKER_07]: For our project, we are working with the CCSR, our advisor, Ms.

230
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Smith, Ben Barkan, Michael Ruggerio,

231
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:19,839
[SPEAKER_07]: kindly, we would like to proceed on our project in the fall of 2018.

232
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:31,246
[SPEAKER_07]: We would like to accomplish this by using generous donations of Mr. Ruggiero, which include blueberry bushes, labor, and soil preparations, and Mr. Barkin, which include the trees.

233
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:37,249
[SPEAKER_07]: We also will receive a small amount of funding through the Cummings Foundation, which is a CCSR mini-grant.

234
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, we are seeking additional grant funding as well to support our project.

235
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:46,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you may have questions about maintenance, in which I will guide your attention to my colleague, Emily.

236
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

237
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:49,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

238
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:54,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, my name is Emily Getty, and I'm a freshman at Medford High.

239
00:13:55,417 --> 00:14:02,202
[SPEAKER_00]: So harvesting and caring for the plants is obviously not going to be an easy feat, and it's definitely not one that can be done alone.

240
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:08,006
[SPEAKER_00]: So our solution to find help would be to reach out and recruit school clubs, such as the CCSR,

241
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:20,396
[SPEAKER_00]: or other clubs to help sometime after school or on another planned date to help harvest and plant the trees during peak times, which, as Praviti said, would be later in the fall of this year.

242
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:29,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would also like to reach out to any other Medford High students willing to sign up, and we would, in turn, provide community service hours to them.

243
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:38,366
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also ask community volunteers, such as the Redemption Hill Church and the Medford Family Network garden play groups.

244
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:47,159
[SPEAKER_08]: We feel that planting fruit trees on the grounds of Medford High will have numerous benefits.

245
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:54,306
[SPEAKER_08]: The fruit trees will provide fresh fruit that will be handed out for no charge to students at the Medford High School.

246
00:14:55,767 --> 00:15:05,617
[SPEAKER_08]: The fruit trees will provide an educational opportunity for students to learn about the planting and harvesting of the fruit trees, as well as the life cycle of the trees.

247
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:14,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Having fruit trees on the grounds of Medford High will beautify the grounds on the outside area of the school by adding color and making it a more positive environment for the students.

248
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:20,811
[SPEAKER_08]: We feel that this project is very important for many reasons, including it will make Medford a nicer and happier place.

249
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:25,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Helping the environment makes me feel happy and feel like a better person.

250
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:30,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make not just the environment a better place, but the people living in it too.

251
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:38,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I want, we want to plant this orchard for it to benefit students at the Medford High School and people that live throughout Medford.

252
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:44,954
[SPEAKER_08]: This one change to Medford High will make the grounds in Medford High a more positive environment and a more positive school.

253
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,716
[SPEAKER_07]: You may be wondering why this project is so important to us.

254
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:58,218
[SPEAKER_07]: As ninth graders, we want to beautify the school and improve the general lifestyle of the school.

255
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:07,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, the Medford High School has a basic connotation of a cement building, but with a unique orchard, it's a whole boost.

256
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:13,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And, I mean, I haven't heard of any other school with an orchard right in their backyard.

257
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:17,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a really unique aspect that I think would be a great add to Medford High.

258
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:32,192
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, this project is important because as of now, I've been at Medford High for almost a year, and I consider it to be a home away from home, just as it is to many other kids.

259
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:40,780
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, I attended the Day on the Hill event in Boston, and one of the issues that we talked about with Medford High is trying to

260
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:45,055
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the enthusiasm of Medford High.

261
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:53,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And in creating an orchard, we could boost school spirit in the students because it sets Medford High apart from other schools.

262
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:56,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And it creates a beautiful place to learn.

263
00:16:57,503 --> 00:17:03,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Having an orchard in the fells and adding new plant life will hopefully recharge the likeliness of the student body as well.

264
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Do any of you have any questions for us?

265
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:13,587
[SPEAKER_02]: So first I want to say I think this is an absolutely wonderful idea.

266
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:26,014
[SPEAKER_02]: When that entranceway was refurbished some years ago, the idea always was that there should be plantings on that hill adjacent to the steps.

267
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:33,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always made me very sad that that, you know, it's just kind of a dull space rather than an exciting space.

268
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very enthusiastic about this project, and I really appreciate the idea.

269
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:45,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I have only one concern, which, you know, maybe you've thought about.

270
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:56,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see that a fallen apple could make a great missile, ball, substitute ball.

271
00:17:57,187 --> 00:18:02,231
[SPEAKER_02]: So, projectile is probably the word that I really want.

272
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:03,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to

273
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:17,195
[SPEAKER_02]: ask if you've considered that, and how would you make sure that students are respectful of the fallen fruit, and that we wouldn't find it being used for target practice against the side of the school?

274
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:33,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we have considered that, and along with the maintenance, with the people volunteering, we would like to create a sort of schedule to maintain the fallen apples, so we could keep as many apples from off the field as possible.

275
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:42,566
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe some signage too about this project and what it is might help so that the students really are respectful of it.

276
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:49,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course there will be rules and regulations to the orchard for no harmfulness being done.

277
00:18:50,891 --> 00:19:00,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in terms of the slope of the area that is to be planted, is that slope okay for the trees that you've suggested?

278
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:02,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it matter that there's a slope?

279
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:10,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we've met with a landscaper who has laid out for us the position of the trees, which Ms.

280
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Smith will address.

281
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,595
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, the slope actually is beneficial.

282
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:15,336
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, great.

283
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:21,544
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, so it gets all the sun, so they'll get all the way up the orchard, they'll get sun evenly distributed that way.

284
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:23,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and how about watering the trees?

285
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:25,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Making sure they've got enough water.

286
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:31,967
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, there is water access on the side of the building, so we'll have to figure some way to do that.

287
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:40,770
[SPEAKER_27]: But I know, I think our buddy Mr. Ruggiero over there has experience with drip irrigation and can help us set something up.

288
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:48,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to also thank my colleague for donating the blueberries and being a help in this project.

289
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great, girls.

290
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for your presentation tonight.

291
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:53,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

292
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:53,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

293
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:54,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Benedetto?

294
00:19:54,817 --> 00:20:05,961
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, I just wanted to express how impressed I am with your presentation and how comfortable you seem coming up to the podium.

295
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:16,945
[SPEAKER_18]: The colored pictures, really knowing all your facts and also giving your own personal reasons why it would matter to you really brings that

296
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,130
[SPEAKER_18]: emotional piece, huh?

297
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:30,672
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want at this time to motion to approve the apple orchard and all the other fruit at Meffitt High School.

298
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:40,654
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a great hands-on learning opportunity for not only our high school students, but also all students educated there, especially our early childhood students.

299
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:43,575
[SPEAKER_18]: So at this time, I make that motion.

300
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,241
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion on the floor for approval, seconded by Ms.

301
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:46,762
[SPEAKER_19]: Van de Kloop.

302
00:20:47,002 --> 00:20:47,623
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Russo.

303
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:48,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you.

304
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:50,185
[SPEAKER_10]: This is lovely.

305
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:59,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's an exciting project and certainly I'd be happy to not look at that current field.

306
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:12,462
[SPEAKER_10]: The soil is, I mean, I realize these are not just fruits where you have to care a lot about a regular vegetable garden where soil matters a lot, but is the soil acceptable as it's been tested and is perfectly fine?

307
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:13,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

308
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:14,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

309
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:16,647
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I wanted to know.

310
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,508
[SPEAKER_19]: Very good.

311
00:21:18,548 --> 00:21:19,648
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Ruggiero, you have the floor.

312
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:28,273
[SPEAKER_11]: So we had the reddismith and the landscaper and I, we walked the area and sort of viewed and we also did some soil tests.

313
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:32,155
[SPEAKER_11]: For the high bush blueberries, the soil isn't quite acidic enough.

314
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:37,097
[SPEAKER_11]: If possible, I'm happy to donate the plastic mulch, the thyme, and also the sulfur.

315
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:42,379
[SPEAKER_11]: But if possible, I'd like to start preparing the soil so we can get the pH.

316
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:47,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now the pH is around 6, which is kind of, it's way too high for blueberries.

317
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,920
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to drop that around to about 4.5 or 5.

318
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm happy to donate all the preparations for blueberries, but these other plants that were chosen, I looked them up.

319
00:21:56,442 --> 00:21:57,863
[SPEAKER_11]: and I talked to some horticultural friends.

320
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,405
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all really great plants that they've chosen.

321
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,426
[SPEAKER_11]: We just have to touch up a little bit with the blueberries.

322
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:04,968
[SPEAKER_19]: What work is involved in doing that?

323
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:06,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it depends.

324
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:12,434
[SPEAKER_11]: If the club would like to plant this September, there's a couple of options that we have.

325
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:15,796
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be best to rototill the area for the blueberries.

326
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:20,420
[SPEAKER_11]: I already have about 30 plants in containers, and I have all the plastic mulch.

327
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,684
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I would recommend would be to rototill the area, spread some sulfur,

328
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:36,225
[SPEAKER_11]: and then give it a couple of months, and then we can apply some, I have prepared some acidic wood chips, so that'll help as well.

329
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:39,606
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would prefer to get that done as soon as possible.

330
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,906
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll take me probably about a couple of days, I guess.

331
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:45,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I just need to rototill it, lay down the plastic mulch.

332
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:46,627
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to measure it.

333
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:50,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I also can, I'll send down all the drip irrigation.

334
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Very nice.

335
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:53,347
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.

336
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:56,269
[SPEAKER_19]: I just have a question also.

337
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:56,909
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

338
00:22:56,929 --> 00:22:56,969
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

339
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Mercurio, can you see me now?

340
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:02,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, of course.

341
00:23:02,154 --> 00:23:03,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy to.

342
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:03,495
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

343
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:03,975
[SPEAKER_20]: Kretz.

344
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:04,556
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

345
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:06,878
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to thank you for the presentation.

346
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:07,538
[SPEAKER_20]: It was excellent.

347
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,821
[SPEAKER_20]: And the brochure with the pictures, I can see the vision.

348
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:15,324
[SPEAKER_20]: It would look so beautiful with the plants and the trees and the blueberries.

349
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,466
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Michael, for your donations.

350
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:19,628
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just had a question about

351
00:23:20,435 --> 00:23:27,278
[SPEAKER_20]: Like the deer population that is in the fells like do you think that we're going to attract deers and maybe coming?

352
00:23:28,178 --> 00:23:38,982
[SPEAKER_11]: close to the school This would be up to the school committee how we handle this problem the way I handle this on my farm is we have an electric fence and

353
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:46,111
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to, once again, I'll donate the T-poles and the wiring, and I'll set it up for everyone.

354
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,893
[SPEAKER_11]: My fence has 7,000 volts that run through it.

355
00:23:48,913 --> 00:23:55,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously it won't hurt anyone, but it could be a great prank for kids to mess around with, so we'll have to talk with the community.

356
00:23:55,196 --> 00:24:00,999
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want me to install it, we definitely need to shut it down during school hours, and we'll have to talk.

357
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:06,782
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's possible we could turn it on once school is not in session, and then I could put it on a timer.

358
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:10,837
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can shut it off once it's around 8 o'clock and deer won't bother you.

359
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:16,315
[SPEAKER_20]: So if a person was to walk towards the electric fence, would they get shocked?

360
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:16,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah.

361
00:24:16,895 --> 00:24:20,118
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I just want to get people with me at night.

362
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,940
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll talk about that.

363
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,281
[SPEAKER_11]: We could actually choose a lower voltage.

364
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:28,784
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a higher voltage on my farm because I want the deers to get shocked.

365
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:31,206
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we have people around, we can have a lower voltage.

366
00:24:33,027 --> 00:24:37,070
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically like someone, a little bee sting.

367
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Like someone hits you kind of hard with a pencil eraser is what it feels like.

368
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:43,009
[SPEAKER_11]: it doesn't leave any permanent damage.

369
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,670
[SPEAKER_11]: It's humane to the animals as well.

370
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe with the people again, the rules and regulations would also follow.

371
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:51,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'd have to figure out.

372
00:24:51,595 --> 00:24:53,676
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want, I'll be happy to lay down the fence.

373
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:54,837
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll hold off.

374
00:24:54,997 --> 00:24:56,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Or we'll hold off.

375
00:24:56,098 --> 00:24:56,839
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine, too.

376
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:58,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Liability.

377
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,200
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to.

378
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,941
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I understand.

379
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:01,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Good question, Kat.

380
00:25:01,362 --> 00:25:01,542
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

381
00:25:01,562 --> 00:25:01,842
[SPEAKER_19]: Kratz.

382
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:03,643
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you all set, Ms.

383
00:25:03,663 --> 00:25:03,884
[SPEAKER_19]: Kratz?

384
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:04,244
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

385
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:05,024
OK.

386
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, thank you, Carly, Prabhati, and Emily.

387
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:10,621
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.

388
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,683
[SPEAKER_19]: And your adjectives that you used were boost and recharge.

389
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:16,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Great words, and they mean a lot.

390
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:19,146
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that many of the students will feel the same way as you.

391
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,207
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a great project.

392
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,668
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks, Sean, for us as well.

393
00:25:22,408 --> 00:25:24,970
[SPEAKER_19]: I know he won't be able to do any of the hard work, though, right?

394
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,531
[SPEAKER_19]: He's graduating.

395
00:25:27,691 --> 00:25:28,812
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's up to you three.

396
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:30,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

397
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:31,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Vandekloot.

398
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:33,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one of the things which makes this particularly

399
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:43,669
[SPEAKER_02]: is that the fact that you guys are just freshmen now, and you're gonna be able to, you're gonna have a piece of this throughout the rest of your high school career.

400
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:48,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really makes this even more meaningful than if you were seniors going out the door.

401
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much.

402
00:25:50,753 --> 00:25:51,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you ladies.

403
00:25:57,465 --> 00:25:58,005
[SPEAKER_19]: for approval.

404
00:25:58,766 --> 00:25:59,726
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

405
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Kretz.

406
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Supporting the Tilling.

407
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,310
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, just coordinate with John.

408
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:17,675
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

409
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:20,837
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

410
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:24,158
[SPEAKER_19]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

411
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:25,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations, great job.

412
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:27,020
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice job tonight.

413
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:43,398
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, while we're under suspension, we have a report on the student award for foreign languages.

414
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:49,561
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you like to come up here and say a few words so you can speak out to everyone?

415
00:27:11,445 --> 00:27:12,225
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, Mr. Carlin.

416
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:13,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, good evening.

417
00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:13,606
[SPEAKER_19]: The floor is yours.

418
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:14,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

419
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:29,710
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am pleased to announce that a student, Medford High School sophomore, Cheng Cheng, scored in the top 1% of international Italian exams.

420
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,590
[SPEAKER_09]: She was the only one.

421
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,349
[SPEAKER_09]: She's the only one in Massachusetts to do so.

422
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:53,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, she got a gold medal and a check for $50, but the exciting part is that she also got a two-week all-paid expense to study in Italy, of course, in Italy, which includes tuition.

423
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:55,269
[SPEAKER_09]: and accommodations.

424
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,892
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are three schools in Italy that she can choose from.

425
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:08,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And she also gets $10,000, excuse me, not $10,000, $1,000 to help with the cost for the airfare.

426
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:11,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're very proud of Cheng.

427
00:28:12,277 --> 00:28:14,358
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's here with her family.

428
00:28:14,438 --> 00:28:16,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

429
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:18,900
[SPEAKER_09]: You can say it in Italian.

430
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,500
[SPEAKER_06]: In Italian.

431
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,621
[SPEAKER_06]: You can say something in Italian.

432
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.

433
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:44,442
[SPEAKER_19]: So the Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Chen Chang, gold medal recipient, National Italian Exam 2018, signed by all members of the school committee.

434
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:45,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations, Chang.

435
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:48,363
[SPEAKER_19]: Wonderful, great job.

436
00:28:48,503 --> 00:28:49,644
[SPEAKER_19]: You must be so proud.

437
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:51,484
[SPEAKER_19]: We are here, very proud, thank you.

438
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:52,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Very nice, thank you.

439
00:28:57,843 --> 00:29:03,806
[SPEAKER_19]: Would Chang's parents like to come forward?

440
00:29:45,595 --> 00:30:04,301
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, everybody get closer.

441
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:19,880
[SPEAKER_25]: Say pizza.

442
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:53,802
Okay.

443
00:31:23,355 --> 00:31:23,715
[SPEAKER_19]: There he is.

444
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:24,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, we haven't approved him yet.

445
00:31:25,376 --> 00:31:25,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

446
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:26,917
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't approved him.

447
00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:27,657
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

448
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,097
[SPEAKER_19]: We have him.

449
00:31:29,918 --> 00:31:32,700
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the report you put in the wrong place.

450
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,840
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not there.

451
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,202
[SPEAKER_01]: The only question is, is he?

452
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:36,482
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

453
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:37,882
[SPEAKER_19]: So there is none?

454
00:31:37,902 --> 00:31:38,463
[SPEAKER_01]: There's none.

455
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:38,883
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an idea.

456
00:31:39,423 --> 00:31:39,503
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

457
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,825
[SPEAKER_01]: The only question was they passed on a 7-0 for just a vote, too.

458
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:43,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

459
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:44,446
[SPEAKER_19]: So we don't have a full minute.

460
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:45,126
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

461
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:45,366
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

462
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:47,927
[SPEAKER_19]: All set?

463
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:51,723
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

464
00:31:51,763 --> 00:31:52,463
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

465
00:31:52,804 --> 00:31:53,424
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

466
00:31:53,484 --> 00:31:54,205
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

467
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:58,228
[SPEAKER_19]: The committee of the whole minutes are not complete from May 17th.

468
00:31:58,308 --> 00:32:00,350
[SPEAKER_19]: They will be provided to us at our next meeting.

469
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,551
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct, Mr. Superintendent?

470
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:06,695
[SPEAKER_19]: So the packet that you have is actually for the old business item.

471
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:08,577
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you could just move that to the back.

472
00:32:09,598 --> 00:32:10,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, report of superintendent.

473
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:13,001
[SPEAKER_19]: Report on building bridges to kindergarten.

474
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,002
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Superintendent.

475
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:17,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Call upon our assistant superintendent to give this report.

476
00:32:17,124 --> 00:32:17,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

477
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:17,765
[SPEAKER_19]: Caldwell.

478
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:19,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, everybody.

479
00:32:20,516 --> 00:32:32,120
[SPEAKER_14]: So our Building Bridges to Kindergarten took place on Tuesday, April 10th at Medford High School and on May 3rd at the Roberts Elementary School from 7 to 8 p.m.

480
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:40,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Extended hours for registration were offered on March 20th and were offered again on April 10th as well.

481
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:46,586
[SPEAKER_14]: As you know, we've had some inclement weather this past winter, so we had to rearrange our schedules.

482
00:32:47,598 --> 00:33:00,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Maria Michelli, who was a kindergarten teacher at the Brooks Elementary School, presented to our new kindergarten families what to expect when their children go into kindergarten, and as you know, we had a lot of anxious parents mulling about.

483
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:07,233
[SPEAKER_14]: There were discussions and questions about curriculum, snacks and lunch, safety protocols in each building,

484
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:12,893
[SPEAKER_14]: the before and after school programs, and how the kiddos ride the bus.

485
00:33:13,794 --> 00:33:23,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Shelly Gross, our early childhood director, was available to discuss transition plans for preschool and after school, and we had before school, as well as CPAC.

486
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:27,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Attached is the letter and flyer that we sent home to parents,

487
00:33:28,092 --> 00:33:30,874
[SPEAKER_14]: This information is also listed on our website.

488
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:43,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Our enrollment is consistent with what it has been in the years past, but I actually checked with Maria Ibrahim this morning, and we're up 13 students at the same time as last year.

489
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:47,605
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually, the Columbus Elementary School has increased by a good margin.

490
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:55,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Kindergarten Open House was on Wednesday, May 9th, at each of our elementary schools from two to three o'clock.

491
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:57,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Early Childhood Director Shelly Gross

492
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:01,542
[SPEAKER_14]: was available to provide a welcome packet to each of our families.

493
00:34:02,262 --> 00:34:05,806
[SPEAKER_14]: And before and after school programs still have the registration in progress.

494
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:10,671
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to show you what the kindergarten packets look like that each family.

495
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:14,055
[SPEAKER_14]: This was designed by our students.

496
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:20,842
[SPEAKER_14]: And inside the bag, each of our families received a welcome to kindergarten packet.

497
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,766
[SPEAKER_14]: That goes to parents.

498
00:34:23,946 --> 00:34:31,909
[SPEAKER_14]: For children, this is what we do in kindergarten, and just a couple of manipulatives and some toys for the kids, chalks that they can write.

499
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:38,992
[SPEAKER_14]: So each of our parents and families receive these little gifts and welcome when they went to the elementary schools.

500
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:40,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Very nice.

501
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:42,594
[SPEAKER_19]: Are there any questions?

502
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:46,867
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Ruggiero.

503
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:48,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to comment how awesome that little bag is.

504
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:53,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for putting that together as a father who's about to have a kid go into kindergarten.

505
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:54,834
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a pretty frightening time.

506
00:34:54,914 --> 00:34:57,617
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that makes a lot of people a little more nervous.

507
00:34:57,657 --> 00:34:58,497
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a scary time.

508
00:34:58,537 --> 00:34:59,358
[SPEAKER_11]: And it only gets worse.

509
00:34:59,418 --> 00:35:00,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.

510
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:01,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Or so I've heard.

511
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,681
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a difficult time.

512
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:06,904
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's your first student going, a child going into kindergarten, you don't know what to expect.

513
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:14,591
[SPEAKER_14]: So our kindergarten teachers are available to talk to you and to show you around the rooms, the different centers that they have

514
00:35:15,065 --> 00:35:20,987
[SPEAKER_14]: the play areas, which is still really important because kids learn through play that we do in kindergarten.

515
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:30,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know, have you heard much interest expressed in the community about starting a pre-K program that's also available for everyone?

516
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:31,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, for everyone.

517
00:35:31,952 --> 00:35:33,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we do have preschools available.

518
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:36,314
[SPEAKER_14]: We have three or four at the high school.

519
00:35:36,354 --> 00:35:40,215
[SPEAKER_14]: We have two at the Brooks preschool at the kindergarten.

520
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:42,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Each of the other schools have at least one preschool.

521
00:35:42,756 --> 00:35:44,177
[SPEAKER_14]: But you're right, there's a cost to it.

522
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:46,993
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to have universal preschool.

523
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:51,775
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it would, if we can get the children as early as we can, it would be a great thing to do.

524
00:35:51,855 --> 00:35:53,116
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm on board.

525
00:35:53,356 --> 00:35:56,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have a sense of what the cost of that kind of program would be in the community?

526
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:56,978
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not.

527
00:35:57,018 --> 00:35:58,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe I could look into that for you.

528
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:58,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

529
00:35:58,879 --> 00:36:05,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Could we ask that as a report to the superintendent, that we could ask to see how much a universal pre-K program would cost Medford.

530
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:08,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's a cost associated, but it'd be interesting to at least know the figures.

531
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:10,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

532
00:36:10,264 --> 00:36:11,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

533
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:13,406
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Benedetto.

534
00:36:14,162 --> 00:36:14,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

535
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:20,724
[SPEAKER_18]: Diane, we were talking recently about after school and before school programming.

536
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:27,667
[SPEAKER_18]: Were there a lot of new enrollees with this kindergarten open houses for those programs?

537
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:27,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

538
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:30,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to be able to accommodate all of our students?

539
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,769
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes, the answer to the question is yes.

540
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of our new kindergarten parents want before and after school.

541
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:45,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are trying to increase our Columbus after school program because that's growing in leaps and bounds.

542
00:36:45,658 --> 00:36:50,780
[SPEAKER_14]: The Brooks is always a large program, and as you know, the staffing is always an issue.

543
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,423
[SPEAKER_14]: The before school program runs pretty smoothly, and that's mostly because it's an hour before school begins.

544
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:58,544
[SPEAKER_14]: But our staffing does change.

545
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:07,488
[SPEAKER_14]: I know this year I have a teacher at the Brooks School that won't be able to do it next year, so we're always searching for the right people to work with the kids and make sure they get breakfast.

546
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:11,023
[SPEAKER_14]: But the after school is going to be our charge.

547
00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:12,064
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

548
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:23,150
[SPEAKER_18]: We did get an email from a prospective new parent for next year, and they were concerned especially about the capability of after school care.

549
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:28,193
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are going to assure that all new students that enroll are probably going to have a spot?

550
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:30,655
[SPEAKER_14]: I cannot say all students yet.

551
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,736
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to be able to tell you that, but I can't do that yet.

552
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:36,298
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to make sure that staffing is in place

553
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:37,858
[SPEAKER_14]: before we enroll all.

554
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:41,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say two of the four schools are consistent.

555
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:46,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Our staffing is consistent at the McGlynn and at the Roberts in terms of the after school program.

556
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:53,224
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have to look at the Columbus Elementary School because that's grown in leaps and bounds for after school, not so much before school.

557
00:37:53,844 --> 00:37:58,626
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Brooks, we've always had a large number of children who want to come in.

558
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:03,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, I think we only have a few on the waiting list for the Brooks School, but we just need to get the staffing in place.

559
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:08,967
[SPEAKER_18]: And when would we know and be able to tell parents?

560
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:19,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I'm sure if they don't qualify for an after school program, they need as much notice as possible to have a safe place for their children.

561
00:38:20,093 --> 00:38:20,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

562
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:26,777
[SPEAKER_14]: As you know, Shelly Gross is in charge of the after school program, and she is retiring this year.

563
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:34,621
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're in the process of looking at a possible coordinator for before and after school, putting it under one umbrella.

564
00:38:35,303 --> 00:38:43,086
[SPEAKER_14]: And once we get that in place, we're hoping that parents would know, at least in July, whether they're in the program or not, so that they can make other arrangements if they have to.

565
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:44,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

566
00:38:44,126 --> 00:38:44,907
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

567
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:48,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

568
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,468
[SPEAKER_19]: So moved.

569
00:38:49,748 --> 00:38:50,969
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

570
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:51,709
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

571
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:51,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

572
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:53,190
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

573
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:53,890
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

574
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,731
[SPEAKER_19]: You're welcome.

575
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:59,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Report on Columbus Afterschool Math Tutoring Program.

576
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:00,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello again.

577
00:39:02,195 --> 00:39:17,487
[SPEAKER_14]: So I provided each of you with an updated document because, unfortunately, when copies were being made, I didn't get the back pages, so I wanted to give you the new and improved version of the after-school program.

578
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:28,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Kathleen Kay is with us this evening in case you have any questions, but she consulted with her staff and administrators

579
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:35,347
[SPEAKER_14]: who worked on Tuesdays and Thursdays from January 30th until May.

580
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:43,890
[SPEAKER_14]: She's talked about the strengths and some of the concerns we had and maybe some recommendations for next year if we continue to have this program.

581
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:56,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to take a moment to thank the teachers and administrators, specifically Dr. Kaye and Nancy Sherman-Hudson for working so hard to make this program a success and implementing the pilot program.

582
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:00,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Many thanks to our National Honor Society students.

583
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:06,182
[SPEAKER_14]: They were volunteering to work with the children, specifically Erin Diskin.

584
00:40:06,262 --> 00:40:11,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Erin Diskin is actually the daughter of one of our secretaries at the Columbus Elementary School.

585
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:18,308
[SPEAKER_14]: And she came to me one day with this proposal about wanting to help the kids at the Columbus Elementary School.

586
00:40:18,908 --> 00:40:20,829
[SPEAKER_14]: She had a lot of things in place.

587
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:22,310
[SPEAKER_14]: She wanted to do snacks.

588
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,512
[SPEAKER_14]: She wanted to make sure that she understood the behavior mechanisms and what

589
00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:29,017
[SPEAKER_14]: teachers were going to be doing to work with their kids.

590
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:33,180
[SPEAKER_14]: And she promised me other National Honor students to help out as well.

591
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:46,510
[SPEAKER_14]: So I want to thank Erin for her work, and her brother Danny, who also helped us out, Jenna Agnone, Sophia DeMeo, Hannah Chan, and Michaela Rothermel.

592
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:51,874
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd also like to thank the teachers who went out of their way to work with us, Ms.

593
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:53,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Rebecca Cogbill, Ms.

594
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:54,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Karina Merg, Ms.

595
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:55,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Victoria Cavallo,

596
00:40:56,281 --> 00:40:56,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

597
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Noelle Latarella, Ms.

598
00:40:58,181 --> 00:40:59,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Patty Donley, and Ms.

599
00:40:59,742 --> 00:41:04,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Lisa DiPersio, the teachers of those grade levels at the Columbus Elementary School.

600
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:07,304
[SPEAKER_14]: And I need to acknowledge Ms.

601
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:13,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Christine Patterson and Tatiana Hall for helping us arrange the transportation for these children.

602
00:41:14,425 --> 00:41:24,448
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you look at the next page in your packet, it tells you a little bit about what Dr. Kathy Kay put together

603
00:41:24,841 --> 00:41:25,921
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of reading.

604
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:27,382
[SPEAKER_14]: You can do that on your own.

605
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,463
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just came up with some highlights for you.

606
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:36,986
[SPEAKER_14]: What I gathered from this math tutoring program is that many students participated in the program.

607
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:42,648
[SPEAKER_14]: The extended day and bus was just such a plus for the kiddos.

608
00:41:42,688 --> 00:41:43,769
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are the highlights.

609
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:45,450
[SPEAKER_14]: These are the good things about the program.

610
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:50,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Teachers and high school honor class students stepped up when they needed to.

611
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:55,400
[SPEAKER_14]: And the timing of the program was great, too, because it was only 45 minutes.

612
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:03,804
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was just enough time for the kiddos to finish school, have a snack in the cafeteria, and then the teachers came and brought them up to the classrooms.

613
00:42:04,584 --> 00:42:09,727
[SPEAKER_14]: But we do have some concerns moving forward about maybe some ways we might be able to change things for the program.

614
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:14,729
[SPEAKER_14]: One, Dr. K thought we might want to break this up into two sessions.

615
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:16,010
[SPEAKER_14]: And she's here tonight.

616
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,792
[SPEAKER_14]: We can go into more information on that if you would like.

617
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:35,312
[SPEAKER_14]: We also want to work with more targeted groups, so instead of opening it up to every single child to participate in, choose the students who actually need the most amount of help, because those are the kiddos that we need to work with the most.

618
00:42:36,492 --> 00:42:40,375
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to look at our data and our analysis through our teachers.

619
00:42:41,536 --> 00:42:44,958
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the other things that I gathered from the report from Dr. Kay,

620
00:42:45,557 --> 00:42:49,119
[SPEAKER_14]: was that we need to be consistent in the way we manage the program.

621
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:53,061
[SPEAKER_14]: So some teachers were working on Tuesdays but not on Thursdays.

622
00:42:53,641 --> 00:43:01,126
[SPEAKER_14]: We feel that it's a better fit for the children if we have the teachers who are going to work Tuesdays and Thursdays for consistency.

623
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:06,869
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'd like to invite Dr. Kay up to the podium to see if she'd like to add anything or if you have any questions.

624
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:08,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

625
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:14,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Mrs. Caldwell did a great synopsis of the program and how it ran this year.

626
00:43:15,243 --> 00:43:19,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think the biggest pitfall was that we didn't open it up to everybody.

627
00:43:20,427 --> 00:43:39,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the children who were there, really math was a strength for them, and so it was good they were getting more math, but some of the classes had 20 kids in them, and it was almost like doing another math class, because what we wanted to do was make it a tutoring program, so that maybe there were six to eight kids, tops, in a group,

628
00:43:39,752 --> 00:43:45,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And so perhaps we could still afford to have more children involved if we had two sessions.

629
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:51,576
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we took half the kids for the first eight or six weeks and then the other half for another eight or six weeks.

630
00:43:52,036 --> 00:43:54,657
[SPEAKER_05]: So the kids can get a little bit more targeted instruction.

631
00:43:55,157 --> 00:43:57,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the teachers really wanted to look at our data.

632
00:43:57,978 --> 00:44:00,879
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the kids who didn't do well on MCAS last year,

633
00:44:01,477 --> 00:44:07,845
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't want to just focus on, we wanted to help those kids who looked like they would have the chance to move into the next category.

634
00:44:08,525 --> 00:44:15,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those children were doing well in math class on the day to day, so maybe those just aren't good test takers.

635
00:44:15,674 --> 00:44:21,861
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe what we need to do is have a little bit more of tutoring that focuses on that need to make the kids, because now it's online,

636
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:28,988
[SPEAKER_05]: to be more proficient at using the computer and answering questions in that mode.

637
00:44:29,108 --> 00:44:38,652
[SPEAKER_05]: The other piece was that some of the kids were not doing well in math class, but they did okay on the MCAS, and those kids might have fallen through the cracks.

638
00:44:39,072 --> 00:44:45,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we wanted to do is really kind of hone it in a little bit more, make it a little bit more concentrated, and I guess, if you will, make it more of a

639
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:47,726
[SPEAKER_05]: a suggested program.

640
00:44:47,746 --> 00:44:49,547
[SPEAKER_05]: We suggest that you come.

641
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:51,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Some teachers did write that on some of the forms.

642
00:44:51,247 --> 00:45:02,190
[SPEAKER_05]: We really would like Johnny to be involved this year, but if it was a little bit more of, I don't want to say invite, but a more tailored program to fit the kids' needs so that the teachers could really work in a small group.

643
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:09,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Mrs. Sherman-Hudson and I worked with a group, I took Tuesdays and she worked Thursdays, and it was a large group.

644
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:13,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes there were some behavioral issues because it was so large and you're sitting here trying to help

645
00:45:13,763 --> 00:45:18,365
[SPEAKER_05]: one group of children where the others are kind of like, ah, they don't really need to be there because they were good at math.

646
00:45:18,445 --> 00:45:21,246
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would, I think, be the biggest thing.

647
00:45:21,606 --> 00:45:27,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the teachers, if they would be more apt to sign up for it, too, if there's a beginning date and an end date.

648
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:31,349
[SPEAKER_05]: So two sessions, I'll do six weeks, and then you do the other six from the outset.

649
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:32,950
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Benedetto.

650
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:33,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

651
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,391
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really glad that we were able to offer this.

652
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:40,012
[SPEAKER_18]: This came about because of MCAF scores.

653
00:45:40,412 --> 00:45:41,673
[SPEAKER_18]: And was there any?

654
00:45:43,943 --> 00:45:48,946
[SPEAKER_18]: growth, any way to show growth from the beginning of the program for the students to the end of the program?

655
00:45:48,966 --> 00:45:53,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the teachers all gave a pre-test and a post-test at the beginning and the end.

656
00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:58,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the children did better, some of them did not, some of them stayed the same.

657
00:45:58,953 --> 00:46:07,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So the average, when you take the average of the students' scores, they all did better, but that's relative to where they started at for some of the grades.

658
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the third grade group was really, really large.

659
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:17,878
[SPEAKER_05]: So when Mrs. Sherman-Hudson and I weren't teaching a class because we had someone who had to leave the position, we would go up and support in that classroom.

660
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:25,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And the teachers did a lot of great center-type activities or learning games, which would just be much more effective if the group wasn't quite so large.

661
00:46:25,623 --> 00:46:33,228
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I said, there were children who did improve, you know, not to the degrees that we would have hoped if it was a little bit more concentrated.

662
00:46:33,629 --> 00:46:46,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, when I saw the amount of absences, maybe some regulations within the program, like if you're absent more than, if it's a six-week program, if you're absent more than three times, we're gonna give your spot to the next person on the wait list.

663
00:46:47,414 --> 00:46:59,219
[SPEAKER_18]: And like maybe have a contract for people rather than, you know, inconsistency, because the real, we wanna put people that have the opportunity to grow in those spots.

664
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:00,439
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't wanna.

665
00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:02,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I think part of it, that may be the reason, because some kids,

666
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:14,308
[SPEAKER_05]: were invited and their parents signed them up, and then, oh, I don't wanna go, but I think if we told the parents it was really important, then they needed to be here, we were suggesting they were there, that we might have a better success rate there.

667
00:47:15,528 --> 00:47:17,269
[SPEAKER_18]: I have two more questions.

668
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:32,317
[SPEAKER_18]: One is, what was the cost involved, so that way we could plan for next year, because I do think that this may be necessary, depending on MCAT scores, and we'll know that in October, or maybe a little sooner, when the superintendents

669
00:47:32,905 --> 00:47:33,585
[SPEAKER_18]: get that data.

670
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:38,666
[SPEAKER_14]: So the cost is the cost of a bus every Tuesday and Thursday, and I think Ms.

671
00:47:38,686 --> 00:47:40,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Patterson probably knows the answer to that.

672
00:47:44,187 --> 00:47:46,168
[SPEAKER_18]: The cost of the teachers, is that right?

673
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:52,709
[SPEAKER_18]: Could we get a report of a breakdown of that through the mayor to the superintendent?

674
00:47:52,729 --> 00:47:59,090
[SPEAKER_18]: Could we get a report of the cost involved so that way we can make it a priority during our budget season?

675
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:01,851
[SPEAKER_18]: And then like, you know, or if math,

676
00:48:03,624 --> 00:48:09,068
[SPEAKER_18]: coaches or during the day type situation might be more affordable.

677
00:48:09,468 --> 00:48:20,955
[SPEAKER_18]: But I like the idea of having a later time at different schools for kids to go home and they can take advantage of other programming, not just this programming at the school.

678
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:25,437
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a great advantage for students that have no other way home.

679
00:48:27,481 --> 00:48:29,222
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bus did really work well.

680
00:48:29,502 --> 00:48:30,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised, though.

681
00:48:30,243 --> 00:48:32,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought more students would take the bus than did.

682
00:48:33,565 --> 00:48:37,247
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a number of children who got picked up still.

683
00:48:37,988 --> 00:48:42,710
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was encouraging, too, because sometimes we always think they wouldn't stay after if there wasn't a bus available.

684
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:44,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was nice to see.

685
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:56,018
[SPEAKER_18]: So we should know how much the bus was utilized, and if it's necessary, or a smaller bus, or any ways that we could save money and still provide the programming and not be wasteful.

686
00:48:57,168 --> 00:49:00,150
[SPEAKER_18]: So my last question is really not to both of you.

687
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:08,615
[SPEAKER_18]: The need of this came out because of last year's, especially former fifth graders, scores on MCAS.

688
00:49:09,075 --> 00:49:14,879
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd like to know how we're continuing to follow those students in the sixth grade.

689
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:19,402
[SPEAKER_18]: And if anybody is checking in, I know we've asked before and reports were given to us.

690
00:49:19,762 --> 00:49:21,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that we're getting closer to the end of the year,

691
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:29,372
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that we should have an update on those students and make sure that they received everything they needed for this current MCAS that they just took.

692
00:49:29,872 --> 00:49:41,381
[SPEAKER_18]: And we want a report on how those specific students did as soon as we get the release of their MCAS scores to make sure those students don't fall through any cracks.

693
00:49:41,421 --> 00:49:41,922
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I mean?

694
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you referring to the current fifth grade students?

695
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:44,924
[SPEAKER_19]: Current sixth grade.

696
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:46,165
[SPEAKER_14]: No, current sixth grade.

697
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:49,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I did provide a report earlier for the current sixth graders.

698
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:59,395
[SPEAKER_14]: spoke at the time, it was to Mr. Edwards and to Mr. DeLava that provided me with the information on how the students were doing, and they were making steady progress.

699
00:49:59,435 --> 00:50:02,238
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was happy to notice that.

700
00:50:02,538 --> 00:50:04,500
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just asking for a follow up.

701
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:22,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that they've completed their MCAS, I wanna see the growth from their fifth grade to their sixth grade MCAS scores and make sure that every student that might not have done well last year is moving and showing growth, and if not, they get the services they need in any way, shape, or form.

702
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:23,004
[SPEAKER_18]: That we don't- Next fall.

703
00:50:23,444 --> 00:50:23,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

704
00:50:23,844 --> 00:50:24,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Next fall, we'll get an update.

705
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:29,965
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, so if that could be added to the reports request list for October.

706
00:50:31,085 --> 00:50:31,726
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanna make sure we

707
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:35,511
[SPEAKER_18]: don't drop a link.

708
00:50:35,771 --> 00:50:36,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

709
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:38,673
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

710
00:50:39,293 --> 00:50:39,833
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

711
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:41,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for this report.

712
00:50:42,255 --> 00:50:46,617
[SPEAKER_11]: First off I'm just educational and a huge fan of after school tutoring programs.

713
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:54,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I know from my own students I feel like you know during class I could just sort of run them in circles sometimes when I was one on one with them.

714
00:50:54,821 --> 00:50:56,203
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when the learning really happened.

715
00:50:57,284 --> 00:51:04,432
[SPEAKER_11]: But to that point, I noticed in your report, as you mentioned, the ratio of students to teachers is probably not ideal.

716
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:10,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that if we added two more teachers to the program, that would have really solved the problem?

717
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:13,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do you think, how many teachers would you have wanted ideally?

718
00:51:14,624 --> 00:51:18,486
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I just want to, it's not easy to get the teachers to do this, first of all.

719
00:51:18,866 --> 00:51:25,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Teachers have worked a long day, and now we're asking them to do planning, organizing for another 45 minutes to an hour.

720
00:51:26,972 --> 00:51:29,735
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be one of the issues that we would have to come up with.

721
00:51:30,495 --> 00:51:37,362
[SPEAKER_14]: I still think that we just need smaller groups, that that would really give us the targeted assistance we need to do with the kiddos.

722
00:51:37,602 --> 00:51:37,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

723
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:38,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Please let me know.

724
00:51:39,203 --> 00:51:44,468
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you ever need help in that way, I'm always happy to find one or two days a week to help you out.

725
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:46,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's good.

726
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,552
[SPEAKER_11]: I need the teaching hours for my license anyway to keep it good.

727
00:51:49,824 --> 00:51:59,977
[SPEAKER_11]: My second point is, can you just give me a sense of what percentage, I know maybe you don't have the numbers handy right now, but of the 68 students that participated in the program, how many used the bus?

728
00:52:01,595 --> 00:52:02,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Just ballpark.

729
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:05,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Ballpark, I would say probably one third.

730
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:06,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

731
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some days it seemed like there were a lot of kids, and some days it seemed like almost 60.

732
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:17,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that... A lot of kids belonged to the after-school program as well, so they didn't need transportation.

733
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:20,212
[SPEAKER_05]: They went straight up to the... Right, right.

734
00:52:24,002 --> 00:52:28,327
[SPEAKER_11]: The next question I have for you is, do you know why all these students were participating?

735
00:52:28,408 --> 00:52:30,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Has there been any conversation with the parents?

736
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it just that their parents want them to have more math time?

737
00:52:33,413 --> 00:52:35,115
[SPEAKER_11]: The students are hungry for more math time?

738
00:52:35,556 --> 00:52:38,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is it they saw their MCAS scores and it was like, let's just put out fires?

739
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,462
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that it was, everyone was invited.

740
00:52:42,502 --> 00:52:47,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're all invited to the party, and some parents were like, oh, this is a good thing, why don't you go, you know, two days a week.

741
00:52:47,826 --> 00:52:54,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, for some of them, when the invitation went out, teachers really wrote, I strongly recommend that so-and-so attend this class.

742
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:59,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it was really parental preference, which kids were involved and which kids weren't.

743
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:03,916
[SPEAKER_05]: There were children that we specifically targeted to, you know, with that, and didn't sometimes.

744
00:53:04,454 --> 00:53:19,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, in the future, I think that these type of, and I would like to sort of make this point to my colleagues as well, I think that for our school district to be one of the best in Massachusetts, this is the type of program we're gonna have to have district-wide, because I've seen how effective they can be.

745
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:28,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, for me, when I was a teacher, it was math club, but there were some parents, I was like, yeah, it's not, bring them to math club, it's okay, I'll make sure we find some time for them.

746
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:34,043
[SPEAKER_11]: And it has a huge impact on students, especially when it's in a small environment, more intimate.

747
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,191
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd really like to start thinking about turning this into

748
00:53:38,005 --> 00:53:42,988
[SPEAKER_11]: a district-wide program if we can and sort of use Columbus as a pilot, learn what we can from it.

749
00:53:43,188 --> 00:53:44,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you so much for all this hard work.

750
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really very excited about moving forward.

751
00:53:46,749 --> 00:53:51,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and thank you for making it available to us, too, because we wouldn't have this information if you didn't support it.

752
00:53:51,752 --> 00:53:51,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

753
00:53:52,052 --> 00:53:59,076
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, as, you know, Member DiVendetto mentioned, you know, unfortunately, this program came about sort of in an emergency.

754
00:53:59,136 --> 00:53:59,876
[SPEAKER_11]: We had to do it.

755
00:53:59,976 --> 00:54:04,658
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that, you know, now that the fire is out, there's a lot that we can learn moving forward.

756
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:05,639
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you so much.

757
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,200
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

758
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:07,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Vance, please.

759
00:54:08,321 --> 00:54:09,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

760
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:11,583
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously there's a lot we can learn.

761
00:54:12,524 --> 00:54:17,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Smaller groups, more targeted groups, particularly, you know, with the struggling students.

762
00:54:19,129 --> 00:54:26,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And being able to have extra hands like the high school students is great, just so that you can do a little bit more one-on-one.

763
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:35,020
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I also would like to say, let's say that if this was a six-week opportunity twice a week,

764
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:52,240
[SPEAKER_02]: that we might also think about, there are kids who excel, and it would be great to have maybe not as long, but if they're excited about math and they want it to come so badly, I mean, in an ideal world, if we can afford it, we should also have maybe a shorter, maybe a three-week, you know, session

765
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:55,452
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, for the kids who excel so that we're bringing them up.

766
00:54:55,932 --> 00:54:59,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd really like to see both of those happen.

767
00:55:00,574 --> 00:55:07,218
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were doing it again next year, this year we did it starting, I think it was in February, was it?

768
00:55:07,238 --> 00:55:07,658
[SPEAKER_14]: January.

769
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:08,259
[SPEAKER_02]: January.

770
00:55:08,459 --> 00:55:09,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Very end of January.

771
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:09,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

772
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:14,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you do a session in the fall and then a session in the early winter?

773
00:55:14,242 --> 00:55:15,903
[SPEAKER_02]: What would your optimum

774
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:17,828
[SPEAKER_02]: timing be?

775
00:55:18,368 --> 00:55:25,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I think based on getting the MCAS scores back and having the time to analyze them, earlier than January would probably be better, maybe November.

776
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,555
[SPEAKER_05]: But weather is always a problem.

777
00:55:29,735 --> 00:55:37,079
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes weather's better in November than it is in... And then we could fit in more sessions that way if we start earlier in the year.

778
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:41,722
[SPEAKER_05]: To get those kids who may not be succeeding right away in their classwork early,

779
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:47,875
[SPEAKER_05]: to maybe boost them up so that they can go out of the program and other kids who are continuing to struggle can stay or join.

780
00:55:49,496 --> 00:55:49,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

781
00:55:49,837 --> 00:55:50,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

782
00:55:50,457 --> 00:55:54,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think this really sort of lays the foundation for us.

783
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:55,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize that it is difficult to get

784
00:55:56,154 --> 00:56:03,936
[SPEAKER_02]: faculty members to want to stay and do this, and that we need to be creative and see how else we can get all hands on deck for the kids.

785
00:56:04,016 --> 00:56:06,897
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you very much, and thank your teachers who participated.

786
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:12,298
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very helpful that Mrs. Caldwell was able to get us the high school honor society students to help us, too.

787
00:56:12,338 --> 00:56:16,139
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know those kids enjoyed it, and the children who worked with them enjoyed having them there.

788
00:56:17,121 --> 00:56:24,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if we had some of our brighter fifth grade students who wanted to help in the third grade, you know, that might be something we could look into too.

789
00:56:24,983 --> 00:56:28,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if they had transportation to go home, parents might be more willing to let them stay.

790
00:56:31,664 --> 00:56:32,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

791
00:56:32,404 --> 00:56:32,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

792
00:56:32,784 --> 00:56:33,024
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

793
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:34,505
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanted to thank you for the report.

794
00:56:34,645 --> 00:56:35,525
[SPEAKER_20]: It was excellent.

795
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:42,486
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, I really liked the way that you prepared it with all the feedback and the different ideas for the future.

796
00:56:43,406 --> 00:56:46,787
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do like the idea of like the smaller focus groups

797
00:56:47,224 --> 00:56:52,626
[SPEAKER_20]: And then sending out maybe a letter home to parents, detailing everything in the different time frames.

798
00:56:53,807 --> 00:57:02,050
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think at the high school, when they had a grant for the MCAS tutoring, they did something similar like that, where a letter went home to the families.

799
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:03,231
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was structured.

800
00:57:03,271 --> 00:57:04,791
[SPEAKER_20]: It had all the details in it.

801
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:09,133
[SPEAKER_20]: And you had to sign that your child would make that attendance.

802
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:13,892
[SPEAKER_20]: maybe that would help cut down, of course, the attendance like the next time the programs rolled out.

803
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:28,316
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also loved reading about all the positives where some of the students the next day were saying, you know, we did this in tutoring, and they were just more, they felt successful and more confident in the classroom.

804
00:57:28,637 --> 00:57:29,737
[SPEAKER_20]: So I liked reading that.

805
00:57:29,777 --> 00:57:37,300
[SPEAKER_20]: That sounded, you know, that makes me feel very happy for the students that they felt that now they can, you know, maybe accomplish a little bit more with math.

806
00:57:39,077 --> 00:57:42,858
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want to thank the National Honor Society students for all their help.

807
00:57:42,878 --> 00:57:44,118
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just, that's unbelievable.

808
00:57:44,138 --> 00:57:44,918
[SPEAKER_20]: We can thank them.

809
00:57:45,419 --> 00:57:45,979
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you all.

810
00:57:46,799 --> 00:58:00,302
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one thing that kind of jumped out for me, having taught some of the kids, was, so the teachers use little teaching tips or clues that they come up with over time that may not be consistent across the grade levels.

811
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:03,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that it's not part of the math program, but still they're teaching the skills.

812
00:58:03,383 --> 00:58:04,323
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is when you divide.

813
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:07,524
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a sentence that I taught was, does Mac sell cheeseburgers?

814
00:58:07,928 --> 00:58:09,209
[SPEAKER_05]: for the steps of that you have to do.

815
00:58:09,629 --> 00:58:18,054
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was using the sentence that I had heard Mrs. DiPersio use, who's a fifth grade teacher, but the fourth grade students were arguing with me that that wasn't the right sentence.

816
00:58:19,154 --> 00:58:29,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So what it took away to me was, I spoke to Lisa and I said, you know what, maybe the fourth grade, third grade, and fifth grade team could get together and share these little tips so that third grade can use whatever you want them.

817
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:34,203
[SPEAKER_05]: You agree together as a cross unit what you're going to do because the tips are very helpful.

818
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:42,172
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I'm going to have kids arguing with me, that's not the right one, then it kind of loses its flavor, if you know what I mean.

819
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:49,393
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was just a nice takeaway for me to say that this is a good way for the colleagues to talk across grade levels to make the education their language.

820
00:58:50,213 --> 00:58:50,874
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Russo.

821
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:53,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the report.

822
00:58:54,254 --> 00:58:57,095
[SPEAKER_10]: For children that had 504s and IEPs, were they

823
00:58:57,777 --> 00:58:59,959
[SPEAKER_10]: fully integrated and supported and whatever they needed?

824
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:01,500
[SPEAKER_05]: They were in groups, yes.

825
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes.

826
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:07,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I noticed there was some commentary about disruptive student, maybe just one or more, I don't know.

827
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:12,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to be sure the disruptive did not have anything to do with either of those.

828
00:59:12,889 --> 00:59:13,089
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

829
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:14,891
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was just a behavioral type.

830
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:17,233
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, cool.

831
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:23,938
[SPEAKER_10]: And the issue of the PTO and the

832
00:59:24,898 --> 00:59:27,900
[SPEAKER_10]: PTO would love to be able to use the bus.

833
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:30,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you explain that?

834
00:59:30,242 --> 00:59:32,343
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, what do they want and why isn't it allowed?

835
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:34,285
[SPEAKER_05]: The PTO does after-school programs.

836
00:59:34,325 --> 00:59:39,869
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it the Columbus Clubhouse, which we're trying to get used to the name because it gets confused with the after-school program.

837
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:42,771
[SPEAKER_05]: So kids tell us about the after-school program, I'm like, well, which one?

838
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:44,012
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know.

839
00:59:44,032 --> 00:59:49,576
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the Columbus Clubhouse, there are activities and enrichment type events, karate, Lego club.

840
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:52,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a really good point, and I think that's a really good point.

841
01:00:03,508 --> 01:00:06,851
[SPEAKER_05]: quite possibly mean that we'd need more buses.

842
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:23,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what happens is we have parents manning the Columbus Clubhouse, whereas we as a school are doing the math, so that's one more task now to put onto the school for after hours, and is it manageable, and is there enough room, and how much does it cost, and that kind of thing.

843
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:31,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know that when I've talked about, I'm never gonna use the clubhouse name, by the way, but for the after school enrichment activities,

844
01:00:32,258 --> 01:00:38,301
[SPEAKER_10]: in my six years at the Columbus, it's sort of a running joke that it's always the same kids.

845
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,423
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's true.

846
01:00:40,823 --> 01:00:49,708
[SPEAKER_10]: There can be lots of reasons why other kids aren't participating, but it's pretty clear that one of those reasons certainly is transportation.

847
01:00:49,728 --> 01:01:00,654
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we were to reduce the number of students participating in this by invitation or whatever method happens, I want to make sure we don't end up paying for a bus where there's four kids on it.

848
01:01:02,198 --> 01:01:14,430
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I would just hate to be in a position where we have to decide to cut the bus and lose those four kids when we have another way to fill up the bus, even though it might be more complicated.

849
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:21,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think one of the things that might also be a part of the Columbus Clubhouse, it's not long enough.

850
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:22,708
[SPEAKER_05]: After school is longer.

851
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:28,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe some of those kids don't come to the after school enrichment clubs because the parents need a longer time.

852
01:01:28,749 --> 01:01:29,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can't get them home.

853
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when they get them home, who's with them?

854
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:34,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the after school program runs until 6.

855
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:39,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go to the Y or the Boys and Girls Club, they run later.

856
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:43,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that might be why some of those kids aren't involved in the Columbus Clubhouse.

857
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:44,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Just one factor.

858
01:01:46,614 --> 01:01:48,396
[SPEAKER_10]: And Ms.

859
01:01:48,436 --> 01:02:05,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Caldwell, you also mentioned earlier the, I think you and I had discussed earlier about the sixth graders and trying to track them, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe there was, we didn't see any correlation between the students that had low MCAS scores at the Columbus last year and their grades now.

860
01:02:06,611 --> 01:02:07,231
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

861
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:21,662
[SPEAKER_14]: When we looked at the data that we had, and I checked with the principals and the teachers of the various middle schools, the two middle schools, there was no correlation between the low MCAS scores and how the kiddos were doing in school this year, which is great for us.

862
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:27,226
[SPEAKER_10]: It is great, and it also makes me just... Yes, I know, it makes you want to... I've got to stamp the soapbox so we'll be here all night.

863
01:02:28,367 --> 01:02:33,951
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to make sure that we're not... The curriculum or the tutoring

864
01:02:35,024 --> 01:02:36,886
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's a really good point.

865
01:02:48,528 --> 01:02:52,632
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, we didn't even really go into the computer labs to do that part.

866
01:02:53,713 --> 01:03:00,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that I met with Mrs. McDonoghue, who gave me some, literally, they were word problem-solvings that had lots of different ways to go about it.

867
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had the kids use whiteboards, and they would work together as twos and all that sort of stuff.

868
01:03:04,583 --> 01:03:06,585
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, it was definitely not test prep.

869
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:12,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It was things they needed to be successful on the test, but it wasn't MCAS or whatever.

870
01:03:13,491 --> 01:03:13,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

871
01:03:13,972 --> 01:03:14,232
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

872
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:28,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's really important that we design this program to touch both students that are struggling and students that are excelling.

873
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:32,577
[SPEAKER_11]: What I found personally, there's a really great program called the AMC8s.

874
01:03:33,498 --> 01:03:35,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently I'm talking with Ms.

875
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:38,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Carolyn Joy about this idea of maybe we could add this to the curriculum.

876
01:03:39,021 --> 01:03:45,304
[SPEAKER_11]: They're really wonderful because AM, the American Math Competition, and they're designed for eighth graders.

877
01:03:46,065 --> 01:03:52,989
[SPEAKER_11]: When I taught them to seventh and eighth graders, the problems themselves aren't just like, you know, where's the formula, chunk the formula, and you're done.

878
01:03:53,069 --> 01:03:54,490
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually involve a lot of creativity.

879
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:59,052
[SPEAKER_11]: and they feel a lot more like undergraduate mathematics, as it should be.

880
01:03:59,532 --> 01:04:01,392
[SPEAKER_11]: So the problems are very engaging to students.

881
01:04:01,473 --> 01:04:07,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes it could just be the type of thing where you print out a big packet of problems to students, hand them to them,

882
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:15,325
[SPEAKER_11]: help out the kids that are, you know, struggling a bit, and then check in with your students that are really accelerating.

883
01:04:15,845 --> 01:04:26,552
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that, I mean, from my own educational experience, I really saw a huge impact, because, you know, math can be, you know, it's taught, and this isn't anyone's fault, obviously, but when you're teaching to a test,

884
01:04:27,032 --> 01:04:36,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Math can seem soulless, but the AMC 8s, you really feel the creativity and the beauty of mathematics, which is something we really should have.

885
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:39,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Students really should touch that as well.

886
01:04:39,484 --> 01:04:43,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just, while I understand the cost and I certainly appreciate it,

887
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:56,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes, you know, kids that are accelerating really can kind of cruise a little bit while teachers help the ones that are struggling, give some challenging, more advanced problems to those students so they can get a taste of what math really feels like.

888
01:04:57,906 --> 01:04:59,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, it's a beautiful subject.

889
01:04:59,947 --> 01:05:04,588
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope we can design this program and I hope we can pilot this program for the whole district.

890
01:05:05,606 --> 01:05:06,426
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, thank you.

891
01:05:06,807 --> 01:05:07,307
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

892
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:19,452
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a motion to accept this report as amended with the answers to follow on the cost of the program and for next fall to track the progress of the students from last year, MCAS.

893
01:05:21,033 --> 01:05:22,974
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion, all those in favor?

894
01:05:23,434 --> 01:05:23,534
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

895
01:05:23,934 --> 01:05:24,735
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

896
01:05:25,095 --> 01:05:26,135
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes, thank you.

897
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:32,878
[SPEAKER_19]: Report on seal of biliteracy.

898
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:34,479
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Carlo.

899
01:05:41,727 --> 01:05:42,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening again.

900
01:05:44,628 --> 01:05:48,089
[SPEAKER_09]: So on my pre-budget report, I put as one of my goals.

901
01:05:48,109 --> 01:05:48,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Biliteracy first.

902
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:50,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Biliteracy?

903
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:50,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

904
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:51,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I am doing that.

905
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:58,832
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the pre-budget report, I did put list as one of the goals for next year to implement this seal of biliteracy.

906
01:05:59,452 --> 01:06:00,553
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is this seal?

907
01:06:00,633 --> 01:06:11,456
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a seal that's made by the State Department of Education, and it's given by districts to students who have achieved a certain proficiency

908
01:06:12,275 --> 01:06:17,117
[SPEAKER_09]: in English and another foreign language, at least another foreign language.

909
01:06:18,157 --> 01:06:21,819
[SPEAKER_09]: This started in California in 2008.

910
01:06:22,259 --> 01:06:31,763
[SPEAKER_09]: A group of parents, students, teachers got together and they thought that students should be recognized if they have these skills.

911
01:06:31,783 --> 01:06:37,965
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2012, they awarded the first seals in California and then other states followed.

912
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:42,565
[SPEAKER_09]: In Massachusetts, it was just passed this past November, November 22, 2017.

913
01:06:46,205 --> 01:06:56,527
[SPEAKER_09]: And DESE had on their website, well, they created the regulations, and it was open for public comment.

914
01:06:57,367 --> 01:07:02,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And up until two days ago, so they just put everything together now.

915
01:07:03,108 --> 01:07:06,509
[SPEAKER_09]: And the seals should be ready for September.

916
01:07:09,723 --> 01:07:22,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure how it's going to be, if it's a seal that's stuck on there, or we got an email today saying that it's going to be sent to the district electronically, so I'm not sure how that's going to work.

917
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:38,317
[SPEAKER_09]: But we piloted sort of the seal of biliteracy a little bit this year, and actually Miss Vilma Beeble, who's here with me tonight, she did her practicum for supervisor director with me this year, and she took

918
01:07:38,747 --> 01:07:39,609
[SPEAKER_09]: on this project.

919
01:07:39,809 --> 01:07:40,931
[SPEAKER_09]: She did a lot of research.

920
01:07:40,971 --> 01:07:52,490
[SPEAKER_09]: She joined the group, the Massachusetts group, did monthly webinars and so on, researched the tests, and we picked a test called AAPPL, A-A-P-P-L,

921
01:07:53,250 --> 01:08:08,584
[SPEAKER_09]: that tests proficiency in a language, and we gave it to about 20 students this year in the languages of Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, and Arabic.

922
01:08:10,605 --> 01:08:15,750
[SPEAKER_09]: We're probably not going to get the results on time for graduation, but we will mail

923
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:22,059
[SPEAKER_09]: certificates to the students who pass the test, pass the regulations.

924
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:24,480
[SPEAKER_19]: For next year or for this year?

925
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:24,760
[SPEAKER_09]: For this year.

926
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:27,181
[SPEAKER_09]: This year was just a pilot, so it'll just be a certificate.

927
01:08:27,221 --> 01:08:29,902
[SPEAKER_09]: For next year, it'll be the actual seal, the state seal.

928
01:08:29,922 --> 01:08:31,563
[SPEAKER_19]: Fabulous.

929
01:08:32,843 --> 01:08:32,963
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

930
01:08:33,003 --> 01:08:35,965
[SPEAKER_02]: van der Vloot, I love the idea.

931
01:08:35,985 --> 01:08:39,266
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of questions in terms of practicality.

932
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,427
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the Italian

933
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:45,009
[SPEAKER_02]: exams that you take where the kids, you know.

934
01:08:45,129 --> 01:08:46,029
[SPEAKER_02]: The national exams.

935
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:47,831
[SPEAKER_09]: We do it in all three languages.

936
01:08:47,851 --> 01:08:49,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Would a certain score indicate?

937
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,794
[SPEAKER_09]: No, those scores are not valid.

938
01:08:51,874 --> 01:08:56,937
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be a specific test that's nationally approved, yes.

939
01:08:57,438 --> 01:09:00,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so how much does the AAPPL?

940
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:11,048
[SPEAKER_09]: That's $20, but there is a stamp test that's just a little bit less, maybe $18 per student, and it should be available to all students.

941
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:14,004
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to take the test.

942
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:18,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And students take it as in their, when of their senior year?

943
01:09:19,286 --> 01:09:19,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Senior year.

944
01:09:20,206 --> 01:09:24,928
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be for a senior, but it would be right around January, February maybe.

945
01:09:25,108 --> 01:09:25,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So that they can get it in time.

946
01:09:26,068 --> 01:09:29,209
[SPEAKER_09]: So that they can get it for the graduation or time of graduation.

947
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:39,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't get it, I mean, it would be even more helpful to our students to get some indication of the proficiency level when they're applying to colleges or.

948
01:09:40,233 --> 01:09:40,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

949
01:09:41,536 --> 01:09:43,017
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't really come then.

950
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:45,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really given at graduation.

951
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:49,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I see what you're saying.

952
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:50,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

953
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,422
[SPEAKER_09]: They usually apply to colleges in the fall.

954
01:09:52,702 --> 01:09:52,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

955
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:54,743
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really given at graduation.

956
01:09:55,123 --> 01:09:55,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

957
01:09:56,644 --> 01:10:09,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for me, if it would inspire kids to do well in language, and for certain some kids it will because they would like to get it,

958
01:10:10,408 --> 01:10:11,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a relatively small cost.

959
01:10:11,929 --> 01:10:14,310
[SPEAKER_02]: How many kids do you anticipate would take it?

960
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:15,191
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you were 20.

961
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:16,471
[SPEAKER_09]: This year.

962
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:17,092
[SPEAKER_09]: This year.

963
01:10:17,252 --> 01:10:29,918
[SPEAKER_09]: We opened it up to a small group of seniors, including ELL students, and we got about 20 that wanted to do it.

964
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:32,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we might have 40 or 60?

965
01:10:32,339 --> 01:10:33,820
[SPEAKER_09]: For next year?

966
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

967
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:34,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably more.

968
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping about 60, 75.

969
01:10:41,599 --> 01:10:43,039
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have to be a senior to take it?

970
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:44,120
[SPEAKER_19]: Could you take it as a junior?

971
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,660
[SPEAKER_09]: You could take it, right.

972
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,841
[SPEAKER_09]: You could take it.

973
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:50,382
[SPEAKER_09]: They have what's called the path to biliteracy.

974
01:10:50,842 --> 01:10:55,884
[SPEAKER_09]: You would take it junior year, but that doesn't really guarantee you the seal.

975
01:10:55,944 --> 01:11:00,845
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to show that you continue through senior year with your language and proficiency.

976
01:11:00,865 --> 01:11:01,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

977
01:11:02,126 --> 01:11:02,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Benedetto.

978
01:11:03,286 --> 01:11:03,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

979
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:05,827
[SPEAKER_18]: So, so you're proposing,

980
01:11:06,772 --> 01:11:09,914
[SPEAKER_18]: that students pay the $18 or $20 per thing?

981
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:18,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Because students are already- Right, this year we did it, but I put a line item on my pre-budget report for next year.

982
01:11:18,439 --> 01:11:20,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so a few questions.

983
01:11:21,101 --> 01:11:24,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one, students can pay for it, and it's either $18 or $20 per test.

984
01:11:25,223 --> 01:11:30,646
[SPEAKER_18]: Students are already paying for their AP exams, which are what, at least 63 last time I- No, they're more like 95.

985
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,529
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so that's over $100

986
01:11:35,802 --> 01:11:40,484
[SPEAKER_18]: for just their language, not counting any other AP that they might be taking.

987
01:11:41,105 --> 01:11:46,647
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, the $2,000 that's allocated in your budget report, is that the cost of the seal?

988
01:11:46,767 --> 01:11:47,208
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that the-

989
01:11:48,717 --> 01:11:49,297
[SPEAKER_09]: for the test.

990
01:11:49,358 --> 01:11:52,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if there is any cost for the seal, if they send it electronically.

991
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:53,681
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

992
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:55,962
[SPEAKER_18]: And if there is a cost, is it annually?

993
01:11:56,002 --> 01:11:58,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It would probably be $2, maybe a couple of dollars per student.

994
01:11:59,025 --> 01:11:59,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Per student, or?

995
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:01,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say per student, right?

996
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:03,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something you heard?

997
01:12:03,328 --> 01:12:04,989
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have those answers yet.

998
01:12:05,369 --> 01:12:07,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that something you heard, or is that?

999
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:14,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, that's something that we're thinking, but there's nothing official on that yet, because this was just passed.

1000
01:12:16,695 --> 01:12:22,040
[SPEAKER_18]: can we wait till we get more information from DESC about the cost involved and what's involved?

1001
01:12:23,081 --> 01:12:25,563
[SPEAKER_19]: The budget won't be for another few weeks.

1002
01:12:25,983 --> 01:12:31,788
[SPEAKER_19]: This is just the pre-budget report, so it could be amended based upon the information.

1003
01:12:36,849 --> 01:12:40,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate Mrs. DiCarlo for bringing us this information.

1004
01:12:40,372 --> 01:12:42,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's a really interesting initiative, so thank you.

1005
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:53,631
[SPEAKER_13]: You had just read the six languages, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic.

1006
01:12:54,092 --> 01:12:56,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other language that is taught at the high school?

1007
01:12:57,312 --> 01:12:58,933
[SPEAKER_09]: These aren't languages taught.

1008
01:12:59,293 --> 01:13:03,374
[SPEAKER_09]: We only teach French, Italian, and Spanish.

1009
01:13:03,874 --> 01:13:06,875
[SPEAKER_09]: But these are students that know these languages.

1010
01:13:06,935 --> 01:13:08,175
[SPEAKER_09]: They speak it at home.

1011
01:13:08,736 --> 01:13:09,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And know Latin at the high school?

1012
01:13:10,036 --> 01:13:11,196
[SPEAKER_09]: They could be ELL students.

1013
01:13:11,676 --> 01:13:14,237
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a test for Latin, yes, also.

1014
01:13:14,277 --> 01:13:15,697
[SPEAKER_09]: But you don't have it at the high school.

1015
01:13:15,717 --> 01:13:17,338
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't teach Latin at the high school?

1016
01:13:17,418 --> 01:13:17,458
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1017
01:13:18,779 --> 01:13:20,921
[SPEAKER_13]: So what are the three languages, again, that I taught at high school?

1018
01:13:21,521 --> 01:13:23,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Spanish, Italian, and French.

1019
01:13:23,362 --> 01:13:23,682
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1020
01:13:23,822 --> 01:13:24,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1021
01:13:24,763 --> 01:13:25,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

1022
01:13:27,045 --> 01:13:29,787
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

1023
01:13:31,067 --> 01:13:31,528
[SPEAKER_19]: So moved.

1024
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:33,849
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion.

1025
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:34,850
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

1026
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:34,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1027
01:13:35,751 --> 01:13:36,491
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

1028
01:13:36,631 --> 01:13:37,312
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

1029
01:13:38,112 --> 01:13:38,733
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you on that.

1030
01:13:38,753 --> 01:13:41,395
[SPEAKER_19]: And now we will be moving on to your pre-budget report.

1031
01:13:41,615 --> 01:13:41,755
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1032
01:13:41,855 --> 01:13:42,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we go to that.

1033
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:47,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll be brief.

1034
01:13:47,164 --> 01:13:53,790
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the full report with you, and I'll just outline a few things, and then if you have any questions.

1035
01:13:55,887 --> 01:14:04,451
[SPEAKER_09]: The program that we have, foreign language study, or the introduction to foreign language, starts in second grade with Italian.

1036
01:14:04,491 --> 01:14:11,814
[SPEAKER_09]: They have classes once a week, 45 minutes classes, and they go through fifth grade with that.

1037
01:14:12,274 --> 01:14:14,875
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's supported by a grant from CASIT.

1038
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:20,598
[SPEAKER_09]: In the middle school, students can choose between Spanish or Italian.

1039
01:14:21,301 --> 01:14:23,983
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the high school, we also have French.

1040
01:14:24,063 --> 01:14:26,124
[SPEAKER_09]: They can choose French, Italian, or Spanish.

1041
01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:34,109
[SPEAKER_09]: At the high school, we have courses that go from the very beginning, so year one, level one, all the way up to AP.

1042
01:14:37,311 --> 01:14:49,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Number of teachers that we have, we have four foreign language teachers at the middle school, two at each middle school, and one additional one that travels between the two middle schools.

1043
01:14:50,377 --> 01:14:53,039
[SPEAKER_09]: and we have 10 teachers at the high school.

1044
01:14:55,020 --> 01:15:02,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Funding from this year, 17-18 school year, all funds were used as allocated in the budget.

1045
01:15:04,427 --> 01:15:06,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Some highlights for this past year.

1046
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:10,751
[SPEAKER_09]: We had some trips.

1047
01:15:12,032 --> 01:15:15,334
[SPEAKER_09]: We had an overnight trip for the Italian AP students.

1048
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:22,734
[SPEAKER_09]: They went to Carnegie Hall to see a concert by an Italian composer they had studied in class.

1049
01:15:24,155 --> 01:15:28,698
[SPEAKER_09]: During the February vacation, we had a group of students go to Spain.

1050
01:15:28,718 --> 01:15:30,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a very successful trip.

1051
01:15:30,799 --> 01:15:36,462
[SPEAKER_09]: And then during April vacation, a group of students went to Montreal and Quebec City.

1052
01:15:38,123 --> 01:15:42,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the contests and awards for this year in our department

1053
01:15:43,449 --> 01:15:48,371
[SPEAKER_09]: We had an AP Italian student win $1,000 scholarship in the fall.

1054
01:15:49,312 --> 01:15:57,455
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a French student who earned second prize and won $200 at the French Oratory Contest.

1055
01:15:58,936 --> 01:16:04,058
[SPEAKER_09]: A group of Italian students won second prize in a contest at Northeastern University.

1056
01:16:05,834 --> 01:16:12,938
[SPEAKER_09]: A fourth grade class at the Roberts and four Italian students at the high school won the Cassett contest.

1057
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:17,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And these awards were given yesterday at a function they had.

1058
01:16:17,841 --> 01:16:18,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I attended.

1059
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:19,401
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very nice.

1060
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:24,064
[SPEAKER_09]: The families came, the students came, also from surrounding cities.

1061
01:16:24,864 --> 01:16:29,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it wasn't included in the report because we found out after.

1062
01:16:30,088 --> 01:16:41,191
[SPEAKER_09]: two students from the Andrews Middle School won a contest, a poster contest given by the American Association Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese.

1063
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:43,532
[SPEAKER_09]: So our students are doing well.

1064
01:16:44,532 --> 01:16:55,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the events that we had, we had Italian students attending a night at the opera in Boston in the fall, AP students of

01:16:55,959 --> 01:16:59,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Spanish, participated in some Spanish classes at Tufts University.

1066
01:17:00,843 --> 01:17:06,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And the foreign language club sponsored It Takes Two to Ultimate Tango.

1067
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:10,911
[SPEAKER_09]: They brought some Hispanic culture to students at the high school.

1068
01:17:10,931 --> 01:17:11,751
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very nice.

1069
01:17:13,693 --> 01:17:18,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Professional development for teachers, we get professional development at every department meeting we have.

1070
01:17:19,397 --> 01:17:25,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Some teachers attended the MAFLA conference, which is the Massachusetts Foreign Language Association.

1071
01:17:26,592 --> 01:17:29,793
[SPEAKER_09]: conference, which is given on a weekend.

1072
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:33,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it starts on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and it even goes into Sunday.

1073
01:17:35,176 --> 01:17:40,218
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there was some Saturday workshops that teachers took advantage of.

1074
01:17:41,278 --> 01:17:48,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Exams that we administer are the national exams, and we had about 360 students this year taking these tests.

1075
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:51,602
[SPEAKER_09]: AP exams, that's been going up.

1076
01:17:51,842 --> 01:17:56,004
[SPEAKER_09]: We had 36 students this year taking AP exams, and then we

1077
01:17:56,548 --> 01:18:00,451
[SPEAKER_09]: administered that Apple exam to about 20 students.

1078
01:18:01,492 --> 01:18:06,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Requests for budget for 2018-2019 is gonna be level funded.

1079
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:11,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I just shifted some of the monies, as you can see in your report.

1080
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:18,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Number of current staff, we have 15 foreign language teachers and no additional staff is needed.

1081
01:18:19,266 --> 01:18:25,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Goals and objectives for next year, as you know, I am retiring as of June 30th,

1082
01:18:26,677 --> 01:18:41,468
[SPEAKER_09]: but I hope that my successor will continue with the proficiency journey, and continue to update and refine the curriculum, because that's a continual thing to do, and implement the seal of white literacy.

1083
01:18:42,267 --> 01:18:43,227
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Carlo.

1084
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:43,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1085
01:18:43,728 --> 01:18:44,728
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Ruggiero?

1086
01:18:45,128 --> 01:18:46,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I had a question.

1087
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:47,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1088
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:53,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know if there's interest in the student body in other languages, other than the romance languages?

1089
01:18:53,672 --> 01:18:59,774
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed almost two years ago that I took a survey with the students, all the students in Medford High.

1090
01:19:00,374 --> 01:19:07,917
[SPEAKER_09]: If they were given the chance of taking any language they wanted, list them in the order that they wanted.

1091
01:19:08,017 --> 01:19:09,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And Spanish came number one.

1092
01:19:11,233 --> 01:19:12,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Italian was number two.

1093
01:19:13,513 --> 01:19:14,634
[SPEAKER_09]: French was number three.

1094
01:19:14,714 --> 01:19:16,794
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the three languages that we offer.

1095
01:19:17,214 --> 01:19:18,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Portuguese was four.

1096
01:19:19,394 --> 01:19:21,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there were other languages.

1097
01:19:21,835 --> 01:19:27,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Chinese was there, but it was lower in the choices.

1098
01:19:27,636 --> 01:19:29,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I did send a report to some of you.

1099
01:19:30,456 --> 01:19:31,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, some of the members.

1100
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:32,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1101
01:19:32,557 --> 01:19:33,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's interesting.

1102
01:19:33,917 --> 01:19:34,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

1103
01:19:34,717 --> 01:19:36,177
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my question.

1104
01:19:36,197 --> 01:19:36,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1105
01:19:36,957 --> 01:19:37,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Costone.

1106
01:19:37,618 --> 01:19:39,298
[SPEAKER_13]: For the 36 students who took AP,

1107
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:42,239
[SPEAKER_13]: 12, 12 and 12, so Spanish.

1108
01:19:42,279 --> 01:19:47,444
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, there were three in French, 10 in Italian, and 23 in Spanish.

1109
01:19:47,464 --> 01:19:48,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1110
01:19:49,966 --> 01:19:50,306
[SPEAKER_20]: All set?

1111
01:19:50,847 --> 01:19:51,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

1112
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:52,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

1113
01:19:52,488 --> 01:19:52,768
[SPEAKER_20]: Kretz?

1114
01:19:53,148 --> 01:19:55,731
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep, I just want to thank Ms.

1115
01:19:55,751 --> 01:19:58,813
[SPEAKER_20]: DeCarlo for her years of service and congratulate her on her retirement.

1116
01:19:58,833 --> 01:19:59,654
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, thank you.

1117
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:00,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1118
01:20:04,067 --> 01:20:04,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Benedetto.

1119
01:20:05,048 --> 01:20:05,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1120
01:20:06,209 --> 01:20:09,191
[SPEAKER_18]: Mrs. DeCarlo, do you know what the breakdown of students are?

1121
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:15,555
[SPEAKER_18]: How many children at Meffitt High School are in Spanish, French, and Italian?

1122
01:20:15,635 --> 01:20:17,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the exact numbers.

1123
01:20:17,096 --> 01:20:17,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I could send them to you.

1124
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:24,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm just curious, like, what students, and do students get to pick what they want as freshmen?

1125
01:20:24,425 --> 01:20:24,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1126
01:20:25,185 --> 01:20:25,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1127
01:20:26,006 --> 01:20:28,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially because we don't offer French at the middle schools.

1128
01:20:29,048 --> 01:20:29,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, that's hard.

1129
01:20:29,609 --> 01:20:32,191
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm wondering if that has any impact on the environment.

1130
01:20:32,231 --> 01:20:33,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, it does have an impact.

1131
01:20:33,332 --> 01:20:34,953
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why when Ms.

1132
01:20:34,993 --> 01:20:43,920
[SPEAKER_09]: McStone asked, you know, we only had three French because they start later, and so the only ones that can arrive to the AP level

1133
01:20:44,509 --> 01:20:49,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Those that know some French to begin with are those that are native speakers.

1134
01:20:50,486 --> 01:20:58,370
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so is there any way that, I know that you're retiring soon, is there any way that you could provide us with that breakdown, even in an email?

1135
01:20:58,730 --> 01:20:58,910
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1136
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:04,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Just so we can plan, and I wanna see how strong the programs are, and where the interest is.

1137
01:21:04,773 --> 01:21:11,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I can give you the current students now, and even what the requests are for the following year, so far.

1138
01:21:11,397 --> 01:21:13,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that would be awesome, thank you so much.

1139
01:21:16,358 --> 01:21:17,898
[SPEAKER_18]: you send him to the superintendent.

1140
01:21:17,938 --> 01:21:21,019
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure he's happy to email us that if that's okay.

1141
01:21:21,059 --> 01:21:21,279
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1142
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:23,000
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

1143
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:23,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

1144
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:30,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually we always have some students, even yesterday at the ceremony with the mother came to me that her daughter wants to take French and Italian.

1145
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:33,542
[SPEAKER_09]: She's taking Italian now, but she also knows French.

1146
01:21:33,602 --> 01:21:40,184
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very hard to fit two languages in, um, in the schedule the way it is the high school schedule.

1147
01:21:40,638 --> 01:21:45,640
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have one student right now, she's a junior, she's taking Italian and Spanish.

1148
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:49,061
[SPEAKER_09]: We were able to somehow figure that out.

1149
01:21:49,261 --> 01:21:55,443
[SPEAKER_18]: And especially now, because a few years ago we changed the program so that students take languages all six days.

1150
01:21:55,563 --> 01:21:56,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, every day.

1151
01:21:56,603 --> 01:22:01,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead of, they used to have five day block, like five out of the six day block.

1152
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:03,491
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

1153
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:03,931
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1154
01:22:03,951 --> 01:22:05,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Your report was very thorough.

1155
01:22:05,332 --> 01:22:05,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1156
01:22:06,153 --> 01:22:07,354
[SPEAKER_18]: I know your level of funding.

1157
01:22:08,054 --> 01:22:30,492
[SPEAKER_18]: I just personally, I've known you for many, many years and I can't thank you enough for not only the academic service that you've given these students, but the global opportunities in taking them across the other side of the world and touring Italy and Spain and really giving them an opportunity and seeing the world outside of MedFed.

1158
01:22:31,093 --> 01:22:33,535
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very grateful for those opportunities.

1159
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,337
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wish I had gone with you.

1160
01:22:36,278 --> 01:22:43,424
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you are going to... I just went to the Montreal one, Montreal and Quebec.

1161
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,007
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's my only regret.

1162
01:22:46,407 --> 01:22:49,210
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you very much for your time and dedication.

1163
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your support over the years.

1164
01:22:51,351 --> 01:22:51,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1165
01:22:57,282 --> 01:22:57,462
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1166
01:22:57,482 --> 01:22:58,702
[SPEAKER_19]: Van de Kloot on this?

1167
01:22:58,983 --> 01:23:13,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I just too wanted to add my thoughts and I know we're going to see you again but it's been a long wonderful journey with you and we really, you know, seeing the department grow so much and thank you for all your dedication and the opportunities that have been afforded to our students.

1168
01:23:14,068 --> 01:23:14,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1169
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:16,238
[SPEAKER_19]: You will be missed.

1170
01:23:16,978 --> 01:23:18,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1171
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:23,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion for approval of the pre-budget report offered by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Ms.

1172
01:23:23,543 --> 01:23:29,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Kretz, and the request is to get the enrollment by language for this year and projected for next year by Mr. Benedetto.

1173
01:23:30,067 --> 01:23:30,788
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

1174
01:23:30,808 --> 01:23:31,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1175
01:23:31,869 --> 01:23:32,629
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

1176
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:34,050
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

1177
01:23:34,591 --> 01:23:40,455
[SPEAKER_19]: We also have an item in our agenda that was not listed, so I'd ask the body to take this under suspension.

1178
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:40,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1179
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:41,175
[SPEAKER_19]: Vanderhoof?

1180
01:23:42,298 --> 01:23:49,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Mr. Russo, motion for suspension of the rules to take an Italy student trip.

1181
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:58,694
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. DeCarlo, or Mr. Belson actually, would like to request the approval of a trip to Italy, which will coincide with April vacation week 2019.

1182
01:23:59,515 --> 01:24:01,537
[SPEAKER_19]: Serving as trip leader for this trip will be Ms.

1183
01:24:01,577 --> 01:24:05,741
[SPEAKER_19]: Nicole Chalafo, who served as a chaperone on our 2015 French Italy voyage.

1184
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:10,603
[SPEAKER_19]: and lead teacher for this 2017 Italy trip.

1185
01:24:11,303 --> 01:24:19,545
[SPEAKER_19]: For this trip we will use Travel Design Italy, an educational travel agency which we have used in the past and have been very satisfied with their service.

1186
01:24:20,006 --> 01:24:24,627
[SPEAKER_19]: This organization uses major airlines and provides professional liability and medical insurance.

1187
01:24:27,133 --> 01:24:29,114
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

1188
01:24:29,174 --> 01:24:31,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, this is approval to go.

1189
01:24:31,235 --> 01:24:31,975
[SPEAKER_09]: She wants to go.

1190
01:24:31,995 --> 01:24:33,155
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need another.

1191
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:34,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Once approved.

1192
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:40,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they have, they have the whole report, yes.

1193
01:24:40,519 --> 01:24:44,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see, no, we didn't get to pricing.

1194
01:24:56,978 --> 01:25:00,963
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have, yes, if you look on, there it is.

1195
01:25:01,103 --> 01:25:04,146
[SPEAKER_09]: On the page, what is it?

1196
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:04,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1197
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:09,973
[SPEAKER_09]: One, two, three, page three.

1198
01:25:10,253 --> 01:25:11,474
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the cost breakdown.

1199
01:25:11,694 --> 01:25:13,095
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't get page three.

1200
01:25:14,376 --> 01:25:14,797
[SPEAKER_09]: And four?

1201
01:25:15,317 --> 01:25:15,517
[SPEAKER_19]: No?

1202
01:25:16,058 --> 01:25:17,439
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't get four.

1203
01:25:17,699 --> 01:25:18,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we can do two.

1204
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:19,781
[SPEAKER_19]: That's okay.

1205
01:25:20,421 --> 01:25:21,442
[SPEAKER_19]: We can do two.

1206
01:25:21,842 --> 01:25:23,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1207
01:25:23,203 --> 01:25:23,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1208
01:25:24,684 --> 01:25:26,966
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a motion on the floor to approve the trip?

1209
01:25:27,627 --> 01:25:28,007
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

1210
01:25:28,047 --> 01:25:29,208
[SPEAKER_19]: So seconded by Ms.

1211
01:25:29,248 --> 01:25:29,528
[SPEAKER_19]: Kretz.

1212
01:25:29,648 --> 01:25:31,070
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call vote, please.

1213
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:32,951
[SPEAKER_16]: The price for the trip right now is $30,300.

1214
01:25:36,233 --> 01:25:39,614
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is inclusive of the base travel insurance.

1215
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:42,456
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a cancel for any reason insurance.

1216
01:25:42,576 --> 01:25:52,219
[SPEAKER_16]: That's available at an additional $100 if we want to insist that the students keep up.

1217
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:52,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1218
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:56,761
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is less than in previous years.

1219
01:25:56,781 --> 01:25:57,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Excellent.

1220
01:25:57,121 --> 01:25:57,902
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good value.

1221
01:26:08,693 --> 01:26:10,875
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1222
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:11,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

1223
01:26:13,557 --> 01:26:15,659
[SPEAKER_19]: The superintendent would like to make an announcement.

1224
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:28,130
[SPEAKER_01]: So as much as we're going to miss Rita, and we are going to miss Rita and her wonderful work, this week we begin the formal interviews of foreign language department directors starting Wednesday.

1225
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:32,234
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be a team from the department.

1226
01:26:32,334 --> 01:26:34,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Osborne is also participating.

1227
01:26:35,492 --> 01:26:37,634
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope to have something in front of the committee very soon.

1228
01:26:38,835 --> 01:26:39,195
[SPEAKER_19]: Very good.

1229
01:26:39,415 --> 01:26:39,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1230
01:26:40,776 --> 01:26:41,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1231
01:26:42,718 --> 01:26:43,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1232
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:44,439
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Benedetto?

1233
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:48,362
[SPEAKER_18]: So will the incoming superintendent be part of this process?

1234
01:26:49,142 --> 01:26:49,803
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll be involved.

1235
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,185
[SPEAKER_18]: In what way, Mr. Bellson?

1236
01:26:52,545 --> 01:26:57,429
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll get to see the people that the department screens out, and then she can make some decisions along with everyone else.

1237
01:26:59,410 --> 01:26:59,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us feedback.

1238
01:27:01,692 --> 01:27:05,795
[SPEAKER_18]: she'll be there for the interview process and for the decision making.

1239
01:27:05,815 --> 01:27:08,417
[SPEAKER_19]: Dependent upon her schedule.

1240
01:27:08,677 --> 01:27:15,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Schedule, I can't tie her up every day, so when we get it down to a few people that people are comfortable with, we'll have her involved.

1241
01:27:15,682 --> 01:27:15,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1242
01:27:15,882 --> 01:27:19,265
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she'll give me her feedback as well, and we'll move on.

1243
01:27:20,466 --> 01:27:20,886
[SPEAKER_19]: Very good.

1244
01:27:21,346 --> 01:27:23,888
[SPEAKER_19]: Next item, English Learner Department.

1245
01:27:25,209 --> 01:27:25,970
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Taxara.

1246
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:30,677
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, everyone.

1247
01:28:07,475 --> 01:28:21,485
[SPEAKER_22]: and that includes students at Yale levels one through three that are basically in self-contained classes until four students are hired.

1248
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:30,791
[SPEAKER_22]: And then in high school, we have, not a newcomer's program per se,

1249
01:29:06,172 --> 01:29:10,100
So when we push for this history design,

1250
01:29:43,675 --> 01:29:54,349
[SPEAKER_22]: The school model was created six years ago under another CPR, and that was the model that the Department of Ed wanted.

1251
01:29:58,995 --> 01:30:03,597
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was the model that the Department of Ed wanted six years ago.

1252
01:30:05,037 --> 01:30:06,778
[SPEAKER_23]: But now that's changed.

1253
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:11,620
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's come out of retail for the state.

1254
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:16,802
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, when this went into effect in the middle schools,

1255
01:30:17,942 --> 01:30:19,343
[SPEAKER_23]: the numbers were a lot smaller.

1256
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:24,207
[SPEAKER_23]: So it was easier for all of our middle school students to get what they needed.

1257
01:30:25,288 --> 01:30:31,333
[SPEAKER_23]: As the numbers have continually grown and with the changes in the regs, this model no longer works.

1258
01:30:31,413 --> 01:30:33,415
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what they'd like to see change.

1259
01:30:34,176 --> 01:30:42,923
[SPEAKER_23]: Back in probably the beginning of April, we started the McGlynn EL redesign program.

1260
01:30:44,283 --> 01:31:09,081
[SPEAKER_23]: which involved McGlynn Middle School teachers and the McGlynn administration on looking at ways to redo the schedule to have our students be at grade level and still get all of the classes that they need to support their English language development and the content at grade level with their grade level peers, moving away from that school within a school model.

1261
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,042
[SPEAKER_23]: We're at about 80% finished.

1262
01:31:12,402 --> 01:31:15,525
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sure you'll be getting a report on that, on what that will look like.

1263
01:31:16,306 --> 01:31:18,367
[SPEAKER_23]: We actually met today after school.

1264
01:31:18,928 --> 01:31:22,971
[SPEAKER_23]: There's about 15 people on the team putting this together.

1265
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:33,901
[SPEAKER_23]: So with those changes is why when I go down, well, I guess, let me finish the highlights before I go to Mike.

1266
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,082
[SPEAKER_23]: We offered some pre-K through 12 professional development.

1267
01:31:41,242 --> 01:31:51,950
[SPEAKER_23]: We tied into the union contract with providing teachers with 15 PDPs that could be used for salary credit.

1268
01:31:52,031 --> 01:31:55,793
[SPEAKER_23]: And the focus on that was working with English learners.

1269
01:31:57,014 --> 01:32:03,319
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was on Saturdays at the McGlynn with a combination of face-to-face and online sessions.

1270
01:32:05,259 --> 01:32:14,541
[SPEAKER_23]: We also offered some PD on working with students from Haiti, and actually Mr. Russo was in attendance at that.

1271
01:32:14,922 --> 01:32:20,223
[SPEAKER_23]: I think there were about 35 teachers that came to the McGlynn on a Saturday to be a part of that.

1272
01:32:20,803 --> 01:32:28,445
[SPEAKER_23]: We also offered professional development for our pre-K teachers, which even though we don't necessarily have an EL pre-K program,

1273
01:32:28,996 --> 01:32:45,580
[SPEAKER_23]: Our pre-K teachers do work with English learners, and so we provided professional development for pre-K teachers, which also gave them the opportunity to get their 15 PDPs for license renewal, and just also kind of learn about the process of working with English learners.

1274
01:32:47,586 --> 01:32:51,908
[SPEAKER_23]: One of the things instituted this year were grade-level English language development progress reports.

1275
01:32:53,369 --> 01:33:07,439
[SPEAKER_23]: So every student in the district got a progress report that broke down the four domains of language, reading, writing, listening, and speaking, and you can actually track the student's progress throughout the year.

1276
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:12,001
[SPEAKER_23]: We did the fall and spring common writing prompts.

1277
01:33:12,621 --> 01:33:15,261
[SPEAKER_23]: So we did that across grade level in every school.

1278
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:20,542
[SPEAKER_23]: We're using, the teachers are actually finishing up the spring prompts now.

1279
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:33,185
[SPEAKER_23]: We're using that as part of data collection to monitor student progress and also identify areas of need to help us group students better and support them with what they need.

1280
01:33:34,591 --> 01:33:41,399
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a partnership with Starbase STEM Labs at Hanscom Air Force Base for a summer program.

1281
01:33:41,939 --> 01:33:45,844
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a one-week STEM program at the Air Force Base.

1282
01:33:45,884 --> 01:33:50,810
[SPEAKER_23]: They have this incredible STEM lab where students get to go.

1283
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:53,573
[SPEAKER_23]: It's only available for fifth grade students.

1284
01:33:54,874 --> 01:33:56,955
[SPEAKER_23]: They get to go to the lab.

1285
01:33:57,855 --> 01:33:58,955
[SPEAKER_23]: They get robotics.

1286
01:33:59,035 --> 01:34:01,616
[SPEAKER_23]: They get to work with 3D printers.

1287
01:34:01,756 --> 01:34:04,497
[SPEAKER_23]: There's the engineering design process.

1288
01:34:04,657 --> 01:34:06,457
[SPEAKER_23]: Every day is a different topic.

1289
01:34:06,998 --> 01:34:12,299
[SPEAKER_23]: And that will be offered as a summer program for the one, a summer camp basically for the one week.

1290
01:34:13,499 --> 01:34:19,341
[SPEAKER_23]: It is free, but I can use Title III to pay for the transportation costs to get the students out there.

1291
01:34:20,667 --> 01:34:26,649
[SPEAKER_23]: We're starting an English learner parent advisory council, although I may change the name on that because I was at a conference on Friday.

1292
01:34:26,669 --> 01:34:34,332
[SPEAKER_23]: I always struggle with parent advisory council because many of our students, especially our English learners, may not be here with their parents.

1293
01:34:34,852 --> 01:34:40,134
[SPEAKER_23]: So I might take the parent piece out and maybe call it a district council and call it LDAC.

1294
01:34:42,554 --> 01:34:46,015
[SPEAKER_23]: So that is part of what came out of the look bill in November 2017.

1295
01:34:46,575 --> 01:34:55,738
[SPEAKER_23]: All districts who have more than 100 English learners or 5% of the population need to have this LPAC.

1296
01:34:56,018 --> 01:35:00,739
[SPEAKER_23]: And so the first meeting is to just inform parents about it.

1297
01:35:01,019 --> 01:35:04,440
[SPEAKER_23]: And I believe that is set for the second week in June.

1298
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,321
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know the exact date off the top of my head.

1299
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:13,978
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we started a student translation community service program at Medford High.

1300
01:35:14,518 --> 01:35:24,182
[SPEAKER_23]: This allows students at the high school to act as translators for public events, not report card conferences or anything confidential.

1301
01:35:25,443 --> 01:35:29,846
[SPEAKER_23]: The students, high school students, went down to the elementary schools for their open houses.

1302
01:35:30,827 --> 01:35:32,968
[SPEAKER_23]: They went to the family math nights.

1303
01:35:33,469 --> 01:35:37,432
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is also a program, we give the students community service hours for this.

1304
01:35:38,272 --> 01:35:45,238
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're actually tying that into the seal of biliteracy because English learners are entitled to earn the seal of biliteracy.

1305
01:35:45,998 --> 01:35:51,623
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, our second largest language group is Haitian Creole, but there aren't tests for that.

1306
01:35:51,823 --> 01:36:04,254
[SPEAKER_23]: So the Department of Education is actually coming up with alternative criteria to allow students who can't take that online test to be able to earn the seal, and this is one way that we can fold that into it.

1307
01:36:06,728 --> 01:36:13,849
[SPEAKER_23]: We've established language acquisition teams in every building, and we're doing this for our end-of-the-year placement meetings.

1308
01:36:14,469 --> 01:36:36,073
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're taking, like, the writing data, MCAS scores, you know, the history of MCAS, if available, when the students access scores, which won't be released until May 30th now, and then all of their internal measures, the DRAs that they, the DRA scores that they get, or Fountas and Pinnell,

1309
01:36:36,493 --> 01:36:47,660
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're going to look at the whole student to make placement decisions, especially if we're exiting a student from the program or if we're moving somebody from newcomers to EL pullout.

1310
01:36:48,681 --> 01:36:50,622
[SPEAKER_23]: We're establishing protocols to do that.

1311
01:36:50,762 --> 01:36:55,705
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, that's consistent, you know, throughout the district and we're looking at multiple data points to make that happen.

1312
01:36:56,509 --> 01:36:59,552
[SPEAKER_23]: We did have 100% participation in the access testing.

1313
01:37:00,512 --> 01:37:08,439
[SPEAKER_23]: I also worked with principals and lead teachers in the buildings to decrease the number of days that the students were tested.

1314
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:14,764
[SPEAKER_23]: And we did actually decrease the testing time so we could get back to actual teaching.

1315
01:37:16,726 --> 01:37:23,532
[SPEAKER_23]: We streamlined the EL testing procedures and parent guardian notification at the Parent Information Center and then also when the

1316
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:25,889
[SPEAKER_23]: access scores come out.

1317
01:37:26,009 --> 01:37:27,311
[SPEAKER_23]: We're not waiting until summer.

1318
01:37:27,331 --> 01:37:31,857
[SPEAKER_23]: We're going to get that all taken care of before the students leave in June.

1319
01:37:32,965 --> 01:37:40,270
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there was a life after high school program at Medford High School run by Ami Sanye, one of the EL teachers.

1320
01:37:41,251 --> 01:37:42,612
[SPEAKER_23]: She had speakers come in.

1321
01:37:43,072 --> 01:37:53,159
[SPEAKER_23]: She worked with the librarian to secure the space and set it all up for students to look at their options after high school.

1322
01:37:53,179 --> 01:37:54,480
[SPEAKER_23]: And it wasn't just for seniors.

1323
01:37:54,840 --> 01:38:03,283
[SPEAKER_23]: But it used to be done during the summer, but we moved it up to April so she could get the seniors, because waiting until the summer would preclude them from being a part of it.

1324
01:38:04,204 --> 01:38:05,244
[SPEAKER_23]: So those were our highlights.

1325
01:38:06,745 --> 01:38:18,890
[SPEAKER_23]: So the funding for 2017-18, the textbook budget, a big chunk of it went to the EL Intro to Physics course, which was a new course last year.

1326
01:38:21,129 --> 01:38:23,510
[SPEAKER_23]: We do our summer testing and registration of L's.

1327
01:38:23,911 --> 01:38:26,352
[SPEAKER_23]: That's probably our busiest time of summer.

1328
01:38:28,134 --> 01:38:36,540
[SPEAKER_23]: And then instructional materials office supply for the Yale program K through 12, and then the translation budget, which it's my understanding that was also increased last year.

1329
01:38:38,042 --> 01:38:47,610
[SPEAKER_23]: So the funding request for 18-19, so we can level fund for the summer labor, for the translations, office supplies, and instructional materials.

1330
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:52,374
[SPEAKER_23]: Where I'm hoping to have an increase is on the textbook budget from $4,000 to $7,000.

1331
01:38:53,174 --> 01:39:03,702
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, I'm trying to streamline what's going on in the district across grade levels and also even within schools at the same level.

1332
01:39:04,583 --> 01:39:06,885
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a lot of teacher-created materials,

1333
01:39:07,843 --> 01:39:13,230
[SPEAKER_23]: The Yale curriculum that was left by my predecessor is amazing.

1334
01:39:14,832 --> 01:39:16,614
[SPEAKER_23]: It really is streamlined.

1335
01:39:17,094 --> 01:39:20,618
[SPEAKER_23]: It allowed the teachers to bring in a lot of their own materials.

1336
01:39:21,139 --> 01:39:22,180
[SPEAKER_23]: The struggle with it is

1337
01:39:24,178 --> 01:39:27,722
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not, we don't have a consistent foundation.

1338
01:39:27,842 --> 01:39:31,005
[SPEAKER_23]: So we can have two EL1 classes at the high school.

1339
01:39:31,426 --> 01:39:37,912
[SPEAKER_23]: And now at the McGlynn, with the redesign, we're going to have three EL1 classrooms because there'll be grade level.

1340
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:41,716
[SPEAKER_23]: Three, you know, EL2 classrooms by grade level.

1341
01:39:42,197 --> 01:39:44,199
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we need a consistent measure.

1342
01:39:44,539 --> 01:39:47,302
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we need a foundation, which would be the textbook.

1343
01:39:47,622 --> 01:40:01,427
[SPEAKER_23]: not to replace the curriculum, because the curriculum is still the heart of what we do, but we need a common teaching and assessment tool across the board, and so that's why I'm asking for the additional funding for that.

1344
01:40:01,987 --> 01:40:04,448
[SPEAKER_23]: We've identified the textbook series that we'll be using.

1345
01:40:04,468 --> 01:40:05,308
[SPEAKER_23]: It's in the packet.

1346
01:40:05,688 --> 01:40:10,690
[SPEAKER_23]: For the middle school, it's National Geographic's Inside, and for the high school, it's National Geographic Edge.

1347
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:21,019
[SPEAKER_23]: And they actually do, it's the same format and structure, so it does go up basically from middle school to high school.

1348
01:40:23,838 --> 01:40:28,001
[SPEAKER_23]: And then for the positions, I'm asking for an additional middle school teacher.

1349
01:40:28,441 --> 01:40:31,824
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was actually something that they did ask for in the budget last year.

1350
01:40:31,844 --> 01:40:37,348
[SPEAKER_23]: And it ended up, I think, going to the high school because of that need.

1351
01:40:37,749 --> 01:40:39,810
[SPEAKER_23]: As you know, our numbers are fluid.

1352
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:46,556
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I put in here we're 40 students above what we had last year, which is basically an entire class.

1353
01:40:49,329 --> 01:40:58,537
[SPEAKER_23]: And then that teacher is needed because now once we split the students, they're no longer by language proficiency level, they're now by grade level.

1354
01:40:58,977 --> 01:41:08,605
[SPEAKER_23]: And in order to give the students everything we need to give them, especially our newcomer students, we're going to need the extra teacher to make that happen.

1355
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:20,165
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we had a long-term sub at the high school asking that that position be converted into a full-time position rather than paying a substitute teacher.

1356
01:41:21,285 --> 01:41:31,250
[SPEAKER_23]: There were issues with certification, which won't be a problem next year, and that's why she was a sub and paid at the sub rate.

1357
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:37,573
[SPEAKER_23]: But that will be a full-fledged teacher next year, and that's the Intro to Physics course.

1358
01:41:39,745 --> 01:41:39,925
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1359
01:41:39,985 --> 01:41:40,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Vander Ploet.

1360
01:41:41,186 --> 01:41:42,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Teixeira.

1361
01:41:43,247 --> 01:41:54,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the one question I have for you is with the redesign of the middle school EL program, it still keeps the whole EL population at McGlynn.

1362
01:41:55,293 --> 01:41:55,573
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1363
01:41:55,933 --> 01:42:03,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I understand was done six years ago because it was the way that at the time seemed the most efficient.

1364
01:42:03,737 --> 01:42:08,900
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet at the same time, I think that there is an inequity that builds into our system

1365
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:13,742
[SPEAKER_02]: where we don't have EL students at the Andrews.

1366
01:42:14,763 --> 01:42:23,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Given the numbers that we have now and the redesign you're talking about, does it still make sense to have all the EL students at the Andrews?

1367
01:42:24,483 --> 01:42:45,328
[SPEAKER_23]: So when I ran those statistics, the McGlynn is at 11.6% of the Yale population, which is just slightly higher than 10%, which is kind of, I don't want to say a norm because every district is different, but to be in that 10% range is perfectly acceptable.

1368
01:42:46,178 --> 01:43:04,896
[SPEAKER_23]: One of the advantages of the redesign is that the students are kind of clustered together now, so it seems like a bigger program at the MacLenn than it really is, because they essentially travel as a group, and that goes for their UA classes, it goes for their

1369
01:43:06,757 --> 01:43:08,098
[SPEAKER_23]: even their content classes.

1370
01:43:08,658 --> 01:43:12,460
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're distributing the students, and they're all just on one team.

1371
01:43:13,161 --> 01:43:17,203
[SPEAKER_23]: So now, with this new design, we're putting them on two teams.

1372
01:43:17,503 --> 01:43:24,867
[SPEAKER_23]: They're on the A team and the B team, so the students will be more absorbed into the general school population.

1373
01:43:26,247 --> 01:43:31,230
[SPEAKER_23]: In terms of putting a program at the Andrews, I could do that, and I know space is an issue.

1374
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:43,616
[SPEAKER_23]: But then, now once I put, and this came up in the Department of Ed's CPR, I asked, you know, we have two middle schools, we have a program only in one, are we in compliance?

1375
01:43:43,696 --> 01:43:46,538
[SPEAKER_23]: And she said, yes, that's not a compliance issue.

1376
01:43:47,558 --> 01:43:50,360
[SPEAKER_23]: But if we do move a program over to the Andrews,

1377
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:57,883
[SPEAKER_23]: the program at the Andrews needs to look the same way as it does at the McGlynn, because then it becomes an inequity issue.

1378
01:43:58,404 --> 01:44:02,665
[SPEAKER_23]: So I can put a program at the Andrews, but that will require four teachers.

1379
01:44:04,326 --> 01:44:04,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1380
01:44:08,908 --> 01:44:09,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1381
01:44:10,049 --> 01:44:17,012
[SPEAKER_11]: So of this A team and B team, it's not simply that we can put the B team at the Andrews and the A teams at the McGlynn.

1382
01:44:18,372 --> 01:44:32,906
[SPEAKER_23]: No, because then it would, so the, within the school, so, and if anyone from the McGlynn is watching this, this isn't set in stone, but one team would have the newcomer strand of students, so that would be the A team.

1383
01:44:33,386 --> 01:44:35,488
[SPEAKER_23]: The B team would have the level 3, 4, and 5 students.

1384
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:47,779
[SPEAKER_23]: So if I took the newcomer program over and put it at the Andrews, say that A-team, which I think that was in the proposal that I gave you back in October, I could move that.

1385
01:44:47,819 --> 01:44:51,563
[SPEAKER_23]: That would require three teachers to go over to the,

1386
01:44:53,204 --> 01:45:02,189
[SPEAKER_23]: to go over to the Andrews and two, to remain at the McGlynn to have the three, fours and fives.

1387
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:18,078
[SPEAKER_23]: We can just keep the newcomer program in one of the buildings, but as those newcomer students become fluent and become grade level and go from being a newcomer to a level three, four, well then they need an EL teacher as well.

1388
01:45:18,118 --> 01:45:19,419
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's where the equity is.

1389
01:45:19,959 --> 01:45:21,080
[SPEAKER_23]: So that would be,

1390
01:45:21,962 --> 01:45:24,926
[SPEAKER_23]: additional teaching, you know, in year two, year three.

1391
01:45:25,186 --> 01:45:26,028
[SPEAKER_11]: To just transfer them?

1392
01:45:26,648 --> 01:45:32,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Like once they're, let's say they get to, you have a newcomer student, he's a really quick learner, he moves up to level four.

1393
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:34,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Couldn't we just move him to the other school?

1394
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,243
[SPEAKER_23]: That is not a desired

1395
01:45:38,857 --> 01:45:56,627
[SPEAKER_23]: scenario for any of our students because the idea excuse me well there are other teachers but it's also it's challenging for any student to move around you know you're with your friends you're with your peer group okay now we're moving you this year oh next year you're moving so

1396
01:45:57,067 --> 01:46:02,469
[SPEAKER_23]: If it were a student who, say, came in at the end of fifth grade who was a newcomer.

1397
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:05,951
[SPEAKER_23]: So they're at the Roberts, and everybody does move.

1398
01:46:06,491 --> 01:46:11,453
[SPEAKER_23]: So then they go to the Andrews for one year, and then we're sending them to the McGlynn for another year.

1399
01:46:11,933 --> 01:46:14,894
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's not an ideal situation for any student.

1400
01:46:15,114 --> 01:46:21,217
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's the struggle that I'm having with the Brooks program being separated, because we could conceivably have

1401
01:46:22,517 --> 01:46:27,218
[SPEAKER_23]: A second grade student come in halfway through the year, so they're in the newcomer program.

1402
01:46:28,098 --> 01:46:33,619
[SPEAKER_23]: Now they still need newcomer in September, so we transfer them to the Brooks, I mean to the Roberts.

1403
01:46:34,139 --> 01:46:38,160
[SPEAKER_23]: So then they finish their newcomer program, but their neighborhood school is the Columbus.

1404
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:42,961
[SPEAKER_23]: And in a two and a half year period, we have moved that student to three different schools.

1405
01:46:43,341 --> 01:46:45,881
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's not really what's in the best interest of the student.

1406
01:46:46,202 --> 01:46:48,322
[SPEAKER_23]: And so I'd hate to do that at the middle school level.

1407
01:46:49,348 --> 01:46:51,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I follow up, please?

1408
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:52,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1409
01:46:52,951 --> 01:47:04,219
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess my concern would be when you have a large concentration of EL students at one school, then you also have EL parents also at that same school.

1410
01:47:04,279 --> 01:47:13,666
[SPEAKER_11]: It creates an environment where you might have one program just happens to be wealthier because of the socio dynamics versus the other program.

1411
01:47:14,046 --> 01:47:18,990
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think that we have to recognize as a board that there aren't necessarily perfect solutions

1412
01:47:20,092 --> 01:47:24,835
[SPEAKER_11]: But do we have a sense of how many students are in the A team versus the B team?

1413
01:47:25,995 --> 01:47:27,136
[SPEAKER_23]: No.

1414
01:47:27,156 --> 01:47:30,478
[SPEAKER_23]: The teachers were actually working on putting the schedules together today.

1415
01:47:30,858 --> 01:47:31,638
[SPEAKER_23]: I see.

1416
01:47:31,758 --> 01:47:34,660
[SPEAKER_11]: If you had to like just give me a rough estimate, I'm not trying to put you on the spot.

1417
01:47:37,054 --> 01:47:51,543
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't have the number broken down by newcomers, and a lot of this will be driven by those lab meetings that we have at the end of the year, because that's when we make the decision if a student is still classified as a newcomer, if they're going on to level three, or if they're being reclassified as a FAL.

1418
01:47:53,324 --> 01:48:08,092
[SPEAKER_23]: I wouldn't be able to give you those numbers, but after we, so the lab meetings are the first week in June, because, or first into the second week of June, because the access scores, which are a major component of that, like I said, don't come up until May 30th.

1419
01:48:08,893 --> 01:48:13,715
[SPEAKER_23]: Once we have that, I'll have a clear picture of every student currently in the district and where they're going to be.

1420
01:48:13,735 --> 01:48:16,257
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, thank you.

1421
01:48:16,277 --> 01:48:16,377
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1422
01:48:16,397 --> 01:48:16,697
[SPEAKER_19]: Vander Kloot.

1423
01:48:17,257 --> 01:48:17,998
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I, yes, I'm fine.

1424
01:48:18,178 --> 01:48:18,658
[SPEAKER_19]: You're set.

1425
01:48:19,839 --> 01:48:21,520
[SPEAKER_19]: And now Mia Desmostone.

1426
01:48:23,745 --> 01:48:29,309
[SPEAKER_13]: The scenario where someone would start at the Brooks, then go to the Roberts, and then go to their neighborhood school, do we actually do that?

1427
01:48:29,349 --> 01:48:38,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I've been at the Roberts, and it was my understanding that if the child started at the Roberts, and third, and newcomers, they did stay through for fourth and fifth.

1428
01:48:38,755 --> 01:48:39,256
[SPEAKER_23]: No, they don't.

1429
01:48:39,496 --> 01:48:39,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1430
01:48:39,996 --> 01:48:40,717
[SPEAKER_13]: That I did not know.

1431
01:48:41,217 --> 01:48:48,983
[SPEAKER_13]: So how many, would you say, students a year leave the Brooks or the Roberts to go back to their neighborhood school from the newcomers program?

1432
01:48:50,078 --> 01:48:51,299
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll, again, I'll know.

1433
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:55,844
[SPEAKER_23]: Like last year, I don't know because those decisions were all made before I came on board.

1434
01:48:57,046 --> 01:49:01,851
[SPEAKER_23]: But they did, the state came out with new exit criteria.

1435
01:49:02,131 --> 01:49:08,958
[SPEAKER_23]: And so there were students even over the summer that did, you know, I know of three students that did change schools.

1436
01:49:09,379 --> 01:49:11,341
[SPEAKER_23]: And sometimes it's just for one year.

1437
01:49:12,382 --> 01:49:27,534
[SPEAKER_23]: which is problematic because you've had the student that's been, you know, has only known the Roberts, and then in that final year is going to another school where they don't necessarily have a peer group that they grew up with.

1438
01:49:27,554 --> 01:49:27,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Russo.

1439
01:49:29,456 --> 01:49:40,965
[SPEAKER_10]: So the scenario where we're treating children like luggage, and I can't even believe that that's a real scenario, is that something that as a school committee policy we can change, or is there a reason why we can't just

1440
01:49:41,910 --> 01:49:48,272
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is it there's not enough space?

1441
01:49:48,312 --> 01:49:50,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, what do we need to do to stop that?

1442
01:49:50,212 --> 01:49:53,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's totally beyond acceptable in my mind.

1443
01:49:55,213 --> 01:49:56,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, you could do that.

1444
01:50:03,933 --> 01:50:07,735
[SPEAKER_13]: that I know were in other school districts' neighborhoods, they've all stayed.

1445
01:50:07,836 --> 01:50:10,277
[SPEAKER_13]: And granted, that's maybe going back a few years.

1446
01:50:10,337 --> 01:50:12,839
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking of certain friends of some of my children.

1447
01:50:13,379 --> 01:50:16,221
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know if it was a parent's request to stay at the Roberts.

1448
01:50:16,281 --> 01:50:17,962
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if there's a back story.

1449
01:50:17,982 --> 01:50:20,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know, Mr. Bousman?

1450
01:50:20,263 --> 01:50:23,025
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really depends on the parent.

1451
01:50:23,405 --> 01:50:27,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Some parents like the youngsters to stay with who they've grown up with or who they've gone with.

1452
01:50:27,388 --> 01:50:29,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And other parents want them back in their neighborhood.

1453
01:50:29,349 --> 01:50:32,431
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have siblings back in their neighborhood, and they want them back with the siblings.

1454
01:50:32,451 --> 01:50:33,612
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be daycare issues.

1455
01:50:34,696 --> 01:50:37,178
[SPEAKER_01]: The issues and the variables are tremendous.

1456
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:39,259
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no perfect solution.

1457
01:50:39,959 --> 01:50:41,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the issue.

1458
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:46,463
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you talk to policymakers in town, what they tell you is focus on the child.

1459
01:50:47,323 --> 01:50:48,444
[SPEAKER_01]: What's best for the child?

1460
01:50:48,464 --> 01:50:50,865
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want the child moving around any more than you have to.

1461
01:50:52,046 --> 01:50:54,767
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want a lot of dislocation.

1462
01:50:55,728 --> 01:51:03,892
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't just simply concentrate everything in one place all the time, especially elementary, because you will overload that school.

1463
01:51:04,481 --> 01:51:07,962
[SPEAKER_01]: In middle school, it becomes a little bit more believable because kids are a little bit older.

1464
01:51:08,663 --> 01:51:12,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only two of them, whereas we've got four elementary schools.

1465
01:51:13,144 --> 01:51:13,804
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very tricky.

1466
01:51:13,845 --> 01:51:15,205
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the state makes rules.

1467
01:51:15,245 --> 01:51:16,826
[SPEAKER_01]: The state makes all kinds of policies.

1468
01:51:17,326 --> 01:51:20,107
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a new pro look, which we'll have to see how that plays out.

1469
01:51:22,128 --> 01:51:24,468
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes they don't take into account space.

1470
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:27,290
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't take into account adding additional staff.

1471
01:51:27,310 --> 01:51:33,892
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what Paul was telling you is that to move things over to the Andrews, he needs four additional people.

1472
01:51:35,423 --> 01:51:38,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to tell you, that's over a quarter of a million dollars plus benefits.

1473
01:51:38,886 --> 01:51:40,187
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just for that alone.

1474
01:51:41,308 --> 01:51:42,869
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, there's a lot of trade-offs here.

1475
01:51:42,889 --> 01:51:47,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, tonight as you're talking about different programs, you're talking about you want to add this, you want to do that.

1476
01:51:48,474 --> 01:51:48,995
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wiped out.

1477
01:51:49,955 --> 01:51:51,597
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wiped out if you're going to try and do some of this stuff.

1478
01:51:53,040 --> 01:52:20,698
[SPEAKER_23]: So one of the things that I could do this year, because I don't know what the official district policy is, but when we have our lab meetings, if we're recommending that a student no longer needs newcomers, I can create a form to go home to the parents that's translated, giving them the option to either stay at the Roberts or to go to their neighborhood school, because ultimately the parents

1479
01:52:21,552 --> 01:52:27,536
[SPEAKER_23]: need to make the decision that works best for, or the guardians need to make the decision that works best for the family.

1480
01:52:27,836 --> 01:52:33,861
[SPEAKER_23]: But there's been no official policy that I know of on one side of this or the other.

1481
01:52:34,021 --> 01:52:42,507
[SPEAKER_01]: So if- Originally, when the numbers were lower, the thought was always go back to your school, your neighborhood, but things have changed.

1482
01:52:42,527 --> 01:52:45,689
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1483
01:52:46,450 --> 01:52:48,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a motion to accept this report?

1484
01:52:48,291 --> 01:52:48,591
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Ms.

1485
01:52:48,611 --> 01:52:48,971
[SPEAKER_19]: Mustone.

1486
01:52:50,247 --> 01:52:55,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I think this is a conversation that we're having a lot with parents at different schools.

1487
01:52:55,989 --> 01:52:59,811
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are currently five teachers at the McGlynn Middle.

1488
01:53:00,231 --> 01:53:01,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Two for newcomers?

1489
01:53:01,431 --> 01:53:01,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Four.

1490
01:53:01,812 --> 01:53:02,952
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm asking for a fifth.

1491
01:53:03,312 --> 01:53:05,233
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, so two for newcomers.

1492
01:53:07,444 --> 01:53:20,634
[SPEAKER_23]: They all teach newcomers, and they teach all levels, because the program at the McGlynn Middle School is one that the students are grouped by language proficiency, not by grade level.

1493
01:53:21,115 --> 01:53:29,201
[SPEAKER_23]: So a classroom at the McGlynn right now could have level one students, but you have students who are grade six, seven, and eight in one classroom.

1494
01:53:33,702 --> 01:53:36,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it possible that two teachers would stay at the book lab?

1495
01:53:36,944 --> 01:53:40,027
[SPEAKER_13]: One would have newcomers grade 6, 7, and 8, and one would have?

1496
01:53:40,607 --> 01:53:44,910
[SPEAKER_23]: One teacher can't do newcomers because of, see, it's not just one.

1497
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:52,335
[SPEAKER_23]: So the state dictates how many periods of ESL the teacher, I mean, the students need.

1498
01:53:52,796 --> 01:53:55,498
[SPEAKER_23]: So newcomers are a minimum of two.

1499
01:53:56,531 --> 01:54:00,117
[SPEAKER_23]: recommended three periods of English language development daily.

1500
01:54:00,697 --> 01:54:03,922
[SPEAKER_23]: So one teacher couldn't teach nine classes.

1501
01:54:03,983 --> 01:54:07,468
[SPEAKER_23]: There's just not enough periods in the day to handle all the newcomers.

1502
01:54:07,808 --> 01:54:09,170
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's just the newcomers.

1503
01:54:09,311 --> 01:54:10,953
[SPEAKER_23]: You have the level twos that also

1504
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,221
[SPEAKER_23]: get two periods a day on minimum.

1505
01:54:14,801 --> 01:54:18,723
[SPEAKER_23]: Threes get one or two, depending upon where they fall on the range.

1506
01:54:19,204 --> 01:54:20,464
[SPEAKER_23]: Fours get one period.

1507
01:54:20,804 --> 01:54:22,405
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we also have the support.

1508
01:54:22,826 --> 01:54:27,528
[SPEAKER_23]: And we also have what we call former English learners, FELs.

1509
01:54:27,848 --> 01:54:29,329
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry, I don't make these acronyms.

1510
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:32,330
[SPEAKER_23]: And those students are monitored.

1511
01:54:32,551 --> 01:54:37,533
[SPEAKER_23]: And then if they need support, they're brought back into the fold to get the support.

1512
01:54:38,393 --> 01:54:41,275
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we just, so I can have

1513
01:54:41,995 --> 01:54:43,376
[SPEAKER_13]: answers to parents' questions.

1514
01:54:43,476 --> 01:54:53,259
[SPEAKER_13]: If we duplicated the same exact middle school model at the Andrews, you would need four, you'd have to keep four at the McGlenn and you'd need four at the Andrews.

1515
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,901
[SPEAKER_23]: If we did newcomers in both buildings.

1516
01:54:57,781 --> 01:55:07,945
[SPEAKER_23]: If we did newcomers just in one of the buildings, which would be permissible, that would be four in one building and then two, a minimum of two at the other building.

1517
01:55:08,544 --> 01:55:11,286
[SPEAKER_13]: but then we would run into moving the kids from the Andrews back to McClint.

1518
01:55:11,306 --> 01:55:15,630
[SPEAKER_13]: So how many teachers would you need if you needed newcomers at both?

1519
01:55:16,651 --> 01:55:17,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Would it then be seven?

1520
01:55:17,952 --> 01:55:18,812
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be eight total.

1521
01:55:18,913 --> 01:55:19,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Eight, okay.

1522
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:33,164
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that, listening to the whole discussion this evening, dealing with extra help and all the other things, we've got to begin to actively and more actively explore the use of software and technology.

1523
01:55:33,765 --> 01:55:36,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as long as something is labor intensive,

1524
01:55:37,342 --> 01:55:40,003
[SPEAKER_01]: You require more and more staff, more and more benefits.

1525
01:55:40,563 --> 01:55:41,383
[SPEAKER_01]: One, you can't afford it.

1526
01:55:41,523 --> 01:55:42,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, you can't schedule it.

1527
01:55:42,523 --> 01:55:43,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, you don't have enough space.

1528
01:55:44,243 --> 01:55:53,545
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to find ways to use the technology more effectively and find those pieces that will attract youngsters, whether it's math or it's language arts or whatever the case may be.

1529
01:55:53,565 --> 01:56:01,667
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to work with some people to see if there's technology assists we can use that also can go home with the youngsters to build language skills.

1530
01:56:01,907 --> 01:56:06,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we are just not going to have enough personnel, space,

1531
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:11,602
[SPEAKER_01]: materials to do everything the state says we're supposed to do on a regular basis.

1532
01:56:11,622 --> 01:56:13,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not just Medford, that's across the board.

1533
01:56:14,604 --> 01:56:15,344
[SPEAKER_01]: That's across the board.

1534
01:56:16,585 --> 01:56:17,225
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. O'Gara.

1535
01:56:18,046 --> 01:56:25,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one of the options that have been floated with some of the parents that have talked to me about this issue is this idea of creating a language magnet school.

1536
01:56:26,475 --> 01:56:27,376
[SPEAKER_11]: at the McGlynn.

1537
01:56:27,796 --> 01:56:34,039
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would be the reason why people want to go there is that they actually maybe has a full bilingual option.

1538
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:43,224
[SPEAKER_11]: So every kid that goes through the McGlynn gets both, I don't know, whichever of the EL students that you have the most of, and that language.

1539
01:56:44,585 --> 01:56:49,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you give me, I mean, I know that I'm asking you to do a lot of ballparking, but is such a program possible?

1540
01:56:50,268 --> 01:56:51,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that an option that's on our table?

1541
01:56:51,889 --> 01:56:55,451
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's an option under the Look Bill, and that would be,

1542
01:56:57,236 --> 01:57:00,219
[SPEAKER_23]: The old model was the transitional bilingual program.

1543
01:57:00,599 --> 01:57:06,544
[SPEAKER_23]: What's permissible is a two-way bilingual program, and that's what you're describing.

1544
01:57:06,804 --> 01:57:14,190
[SPEAKER_23]: So our major languages, our two top languages are Portuguese and Haitian Creole.

1545
01:57:14,611 --> 01:57:17,313
[SPEAKER_23]: Our Spanish numbers are on the lower side.

1546
01:57:17,333 --> 01:57:20,475
[SPEAKER_23]: We wouldn't be able to support a program for Spanish.

1547
01:57:22,978 --> 01:57:28,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any other magnet schools in the area that do either Haitian Creole or Portuguese?

1548
01:57:29,479 --> 01:57:34,780
[SPEAKER_23]: Framingham is the only district that I know of that does the Portuguese program.

1549
01:57:37,001 --> 01:57:49,503
[SPEAKER_23]: And there is a Cape Verdean program in, not New Bedford, but, Brockton.

1550
01:57:51,182 --> 01:57:58,729
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we did a bilingual Portuguese magnet school, we'd be the only one in the state that has that program, is that correct?

1551
01:57:58,789 --> 01:58:00,811
[SPEAKER_23]: Except for Framingham.

1552
01:58:01,151 --> 01:58:03,253
[SPEAKER_23]: So Haitian Creole would be the only one?

1553
01:58:03,273 --> 01:58:04,855
[SPEAKER_23]: Haitian Creole would be the only one.

1554
01:58:04,875 --> 01:58:10,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I know of no Haitian Creole... Could you give us a sense of what it would take to actually architect

1555
01:58:10,513 --> 01:58:12,054
[SPEAKER_11]: like bill for that type of program?

1556
01:58:12,214 --> 01:58:14,935
[SPEAKER_23]: So the state's working on those regs right now.

1557
01:58:15,195 --> 01:58:15,735
[SPEAKER_23]: OK.

1558
01:58:16,135 --> 01:58:21,477
[SPEAKER_23]: And what would be acceptable, basically, the draft, because the draft form that Ms.

1559
01:58:21,497 --> 01:58:26,338
[SPEAKER_23]: DeCarlo was just talking about included all of these other features of the look bill.

1560
01:58:27,099 --> 01:58:39,363
[SPEAKER_23]: And one of them was the requirements for educators to obtain, similar to the SEI endorsement, an endorsement, a bilingual endorsement that would allow them to teach in that native language.

1561
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:43,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul, what's the status of Title III right now?

1562
01:58:43,637 --> 01:58:45,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, everything's up in the air federal.

1563
01:58:45,817 --> 01:58:47,978
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you have a sense of that?

1564
01:58:48,118 --> 01:58:49,618
[SPEAKER_23]: I was just at a meeting on Friday.

1565
01:58:49,638 --> 01:58:51,258
[SPEAKER_23]: Nobody gave good news, bad news.

1566
01:58:51,358 --> 01:58:54,959
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm hoping it's at least at the minimum status quo.

1567
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:59,820
[SPEAKER_11]: So just one last point.

1568
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:07,642
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we did a bilingual Haitian Creole program, every teacher that's in there now, we'd have to find a new home for them.

1569
01:59:08,111 --> 01:59:12,554
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'd have to make sure that, or at least they find a way to get certified in Haitian Creole.

1570
01:59:12,875 --> 01:59:24,443
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, and that's the thing, to find the teachers who are, you know, and then to, you know, it's, that's, like, I'm excited if I can find an EL teacher who's certified in math.

1571
01:59:24,603 --> 01:59:25,864
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the uniform.

1572
01:59:26,865 --> 01:59:36,993
[SPEAKER_23]: So to find somebody who is certified in math who's also, you know, bilingual and, you know, Haitian Creole or English, you know, that's, that's going to be a tough, a tough one to find.

1573
01:59:39,533 --> 01:59:40,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Benedetto.

1574
01:59:40,854 --> 01:59:41,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your report.

1575
01:59:42,235 --> 01:59:48,601
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was very good to see how your first year went and all the initiatives that you put forth.

1576
01:59:48,681 --> 01:59:49,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for all of them.

1577
01:59:50,923 --> 01:59:54,666
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm seeing an increase in EL programs throughout the state.

1578
01:59:55,727 --> 02:00:00,871
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know you commented that we have 40 new students from the beginning of this year till now.

1579
02:00:01,192 --> 02:00:04,054
[SPEAKER_18]: How many students throughout our district are EL students?

1580
02:00:04,434 --> 02:00:06,296
[SPEAKER_23]: So the total number of ELs are 499.

1581
02:00:08,127 --> 02:00:13,271
[SPEAKER_18]: So what is that, 10, 11% district-wide, not just at the McGlynn, but?

1582
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:14,792
[SPEAKER_23]: That's district-wide.

1583
02:00:14,832 --> 02:00:19,616
[SPEAKER_18]: District-wide, so 11% of our students, and rising yearly.

1584
02:00:19,636 --> 02:00:22,979
[SPEAKER_23]: The 11% that I mentioned earlier, that was just the McGlynn numbers.

1585
02:00:22,999 --> 02:00:24,580
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, and this almost matches it.

1586
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:25,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Matches it.

1587
02:00:25,261 --> 02:00:28,863
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so it's indicative of the whole district.

1588
02:00:29,844 --> 02:00:36,069
[SPEAKER_18]: So with it, with the growth that we've seen in the last, what, three to five years,

1589
02:00:36,527 --> 02:00:46,976
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that we need to pre-plan for more EL programs and to have a short-term plan for EL and a long-term plan.

1590
02:00:47,036 --> 02:01:03,511
[SPEAKER_18]: So as the new superintendent comes forward, I'd love to see that and maybe the curriculum subcommittee to talk about this so we can start putting those, I said years ago that EL is gonna be bigger than special education as far as, or equal to it.

1591
02:01:03,887 --> 02:01:23,936
[SPEAKER_18]: as far as programming and some of the programming that you're talking about, the required PAC or DAC, whichever one you choose, and all of those things seem to be following in line of how the special education programs are run throughout the district and their requirements, at least I see that.

1592
02:01:25,891 --> 02:01:30,017
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm also wondering, are we in compliance with the federal government's guidelines on

1593
02:01:42,316 --> 02:01:47,663
[SPEAKER_18]: per child per teacher ratios as far as state requirements?

1594
02:01:47,843 --> 02:02:00,500
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, because we're meeting, it's not a ratio between students and teachers, it's are we delivering service hours based on their access scores.

1595
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:17,855
[SPEAKER_23]: And so one of the things that we did this year was I do a monthly census, maybe more like every six weeks, and it goes out to all of the EL teachers and they have their students, they have their access scores, they indicate how many periods they're seeing them for because there are exceptions.

1596
02:02:18,837 --> 02:02:29,783
[SPEAKER_23]: When we have duly identified students who are getting support from special education, there's just not enough hours in the day for some students to get all the services.

1597
02:02:29,803 --> 02:02:31,544
[SPEAKER_23]: And the department recognizes that.

1598
02:02:31,564 --> 02:02:37,847
[SPEAKER_23]: And as long as we're honoring the spirit of the required hours, we're in compliance.

1599
02:02:37,947 --> 02:02:39,288
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're in good shape there.

1600
02:02:39,808 --> 02:02:42,189
[SPEAKER_18]: And as far as our teachers that need

1601
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:49,264
[SPEAKER_18]: EL training or certification for the retail.

1602
02:02:50,185 --> 02:02:51,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we on track with that?

1603
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:53,388
[SPEAKER_18]: How do we track that for teachers?

1604
02:02:53,508 --> 02:02:53,728
[SPEAKER_18]: We are.

1605
02:02:53,788 --> 02:03:05,159
[SPEAKER_23]: So the curriculum directors have all been managing that for their departments so they know if they have a teacher who needs to get the endorsement and they're dealing with that within their department level.

1606
02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:09,023
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm sure the 15 required hours in EL has helped.

1607
02:03:10,942 --> 02:03:12,583
[SPEAKER_18]: with that, with re-licensure?

1608
02:03:12,983 --> 02:03:15,485
[SPEAKER_23]: With re-licensure, definitely.

1609
02:03:15,545 --> 02:03:22,209
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, anything to do with licensing, as I tell teachers, that's your agreement between you and the state of Massachusetts.

1610
02:03:23,349 --> 02:03:27,052
[SPEAKER_23]: We just have to make sure that you're credentialed to do what we're asking you to do.

1611
02:03:29,033 --> 02:03:37,978
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not going to make an official motion for you to meet with the curriculum subcommittee, but in September or October, maybe,

1612
02:03:38,490 --> 02:03:46,778
[SPEAKER_18]: we could regroup and possibly ask the chairperson to call a meeting and just have short-term and long-term goals with the new superintendent.

1613
02:03:47,138 --> 02:03:55,186
[SPEAKER_18]: She may have some different ideas, having been an instructional superintendent for 15 schools and EL is a big

1614
02:03:55,837 --> 02:03:57,378
[SPEAKER_18]: commitment there in Boston as well.

1615
02:03:57,578 --> 02:04:11,789
[SPEAKER_23]: So one of the things that we've talked about in the EL redesign committee is if the numbers continue to grow, we would have to move the program over to the Andrews, because then we would be repeating the issue that exists there now.

1616
02:04:12,710 --> 02:04:18,555
[SPEAKER_23]: Right now, once we spread them between the two teams, it's now taking some pressure off.

1617
02:04:18,635 --> 02:04:24,379
[SPEAKER_23]: But as the numbers grow, even between the two teams, so we would need to look at the program with the Andrews.

1618
02:04:26,107 --> 02:04:30,151
[SPEAKER_23]: would be one teacher this year, and then next year, if we do it in increments.

1619
02:04:31,912 --> 02:04:42,162
[SPEAKER_23]: As the incoming superintendent proposed her lower middle school, upper middle school plan, that would alleviate a lot of these problems.

1620
02:04:42,685 --> 02:04:55,553
[SPEAKER_23]: And one of the things that the McGlynn teachers are excited about is, because there is a lot of change on the horizon, that whatever plan we create as the EL redesign team will work in almost any scenario.

1621
02:04:56,273 --> 02:04:58,535
[SPEAKER_23]: So they're very happy about that.

1622
02:04:58,735 --> 02:05:07,500
[SPEAKER_18]: And my final question is, have you gotten any feedback from the McGlynn teachers about the change that's gonna take place next year?

1623
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Have they been informed, any feedback?

1624
02:05:11,471 --> 02:05:13,492
[SPEAKER_18]: How are they, in general, feeling about it?

1625
02:05:13,532 --> 02:05:20,597
[SPEAKER_18]: They've had a lot of change through the year, and I just want to make sure that they're incorporated in the communication as well as decision-making.

1626
02:05:20,637 --> 02:05:31,043
[SPEAKER_23]: So the way I set up the team was the email went out through Nick Tucci after he was appointed, asking for representatives from each grade-level team.

1627
02:05:31,143 --> 02:05:33,245
[SPEAKER_23]: So a representative from the A team, the B team.

1628
02:05:33,921 --> 02:05:34,941
[SPEAKER_23]: for every grade level.

1629
02:05:35,282 --> 02:05:40,484
[SPEAKER_23]: Special education, guidance, administration, EL, the UA teachers.

1630
02:05:40,664 --> 02:05:44,505
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's why it's such a big group, because everybody's involved.

1631
02:05:45,466 --> 02:05:52,369
[SPEAKER_23]: Their task between every meeting is to go back to their team, whether it's their grade level team or their department team, and share.

1632
02:05:52,469 --> 02:05:57,111
[SPEAKER_23]: And we start every new session with getting feedback from the rest of the teachers.

1633
02:05:58,191 --> 02:06:00,232
[SPEAKER_18]: And what's the overall

1634
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:09,814
[SPEAKER_23]: They're excited about the change, and this has been coming for a while, and they're glad to be a part of it.

1635
02:06:10,534 --> 02:06:11,835
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't bring any of my posters.

1636
02:06:11,875 --> 02:06:13,616
[SPEAKER_23]: Like I said, we just did this today.

1637
02:06:14,316 --> 02:06:16,137
[SPEAKER_23]: But they're glad the dialogue is happening.

1638
02:06:16,877 --> 02:06:18,578
[SPEAKER_23]: They're glad that they have a voice in it.

1639
02:06:20,039 --> 02:06:22,220
[SPEAKER_23]: So they're excited about the programs being built.

1640
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:25,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for being so inclusive with that situation.

1641
02:06:25,481 --> 02:06:27,282
[SPEAKER_18]: That's important for that community.

1642
02:06:28,323 --> 02:06:32,865
[SPEAKER_18]: A great report, thank you, and I motion to accept the report and place it on file.

1643
02:06:32,905 --> 02:06:35,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to accept the report, seconded by Ms.

1644
02:06:35,526 --> 02:06:36,126
[SPEAKER_19]: Mustone.

1645
02:06:36,786 --> 02:06:37,526
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

1646
02:06:37,546 --> 02:06:37,966
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1647
02:06:38,647 --> 02:06:39,227
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

1648
02:06:39,267 --> 02:06:39,947
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

1649
02:06:39,987 --> 02:06:40,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1650
02:06:40,627 --> 02:06:41,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1651
02:06:43,188 --> 02:06:48,310
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a motion for suspension of the rules to move negotiations and legal matters to the end of the agenda?

1652
02:06:48,470 --> 02:06:49,450
[SPEAKER_19]: So moved by Ms.

1653
02:06:49,510 --> 02:06:51,511
[SPEAKER_19]: Van de Kloot, seconded by Mr. Rousseau.

1654
02:06:52,271 --> 02:06:52,911
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

1655
02:06:52,931 --> 02:06:52,991
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1656
02:06:53,751 --> 02:06:54,452
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

1657
02:06:54,652 --> 02:06:55,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

1658
02:06:56,092 --> 02:07:00,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Old Business, Lesley University and Metro Public Schools Partnership Agreement.

1659
02:07:00,633 --> 02:07:01,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Superintendent.

1660
02:07:04,273 --> 02:07:06,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So last Thursday we had a committee of the whole.

1661
02:07:07,494 --> 02:07:20,936
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the conclusion of the committee of the whole, you voted 7-0 to approve the concept of your plan, but you wanted to understand procurement better and how we were able to do it under the rules so that we could move forward.

1662
02:07:21,637 --> 02:07:22,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight I've handed you a

1663
02:07:24,911 --> 02:07:27,833
[SPEAKER_01]: sheet, two sides, which goes over that.

1664
02:07:27,893 --> 02:07:43,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had substantial discussion, Christine, myself, Mark Rumley, Howard Greenspan, Howard's here, going over these various things and also phone calls into the AG and the IG and all these things as to what we could or couldn't do, and also with Lesley College.

1665
02:07:44,105 --> 02:07:48,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we have to move forward if we're going to get this thing done.

1666
02:07:49,509 --> 02:07:54,373
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order to do it, we have to deal with it a little bit differently than we originally intended.

1667
02:07:55,068 --> 02:07:57,789
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go over this a little bit as a partnership procurement plan.

1668
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:14,414
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to develop an RFP, which is a request for proposals, for the partnership that would include rental, renovation, and professional services between the Medford Public Schools and an area university, an area university, not necessarily any one.

1669
02:08:15,175 --> 02:08:22,397
[SPEAKER_01]: A request for proposals allows us to seek proposals from qualified vendors and to select the most appropriate respondents

1670
02:08:22,898 --> 02:08:25,939
[SPEAKER_01]: based on established criteria first and not price alone.

1671
02:08:26,559 --> 02:08:27,799
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a price issue initially.

1672
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:31,780
[SPEAKER_01]: This RFP cycle is a two-week hosting process.

1673
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:41,123
[SPEAKER_01]: That means once we generate the RFP, hopefully sometime this week with help, we would go out two weeks and put it out there and see who responds.

1674
02:08:42,023 --> 02:08:49,645
[SPEAKER_01]: The RFP would require the successful respondent to meet and agree to all the terms of the RFP specifications, everything we would put in.

1675
02:08:51,265 --> 02:08:59,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Funding for the project would be incorporated into the RFP, we would say what we're looking for, for negotiation between the successful respondent and the Medford Public Schools.

1676
02:09:00,747 --> 02:09:10,388
[SPEAKER_01]: The successful respondent would then be allowed to carry out the construction and renovation of the high school gymnasium facility with provisions for quality control.

1677
02:09:11,229 --> 02:09:16,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say they would do it as opposed to we would do it, okay?

1678
02:09:17,230 --> 02:09:18,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Appropriate insurance coverage.

1679
02:09:18,943 --> 02:09:23,426
[SPEAKER_01]: would be in place to cover any unforeseen issues, any liabilities that would be involved.

1680
02:09:24,326 --> 02:09:28,769
[SPEAKER_01]: The plan would allow for a successful respondent to move quickly towards implementation this summer.

1681
02:09:29,549 --> 02:09:36,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they would be able to do things in the private sector, and we would insist on prevailing wage and things of that type.

1682
02:09:39,115 --> 02:09:43,438
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be able to move a lot faster than a public entity can move under these rules.

1683
02:09:44,785 --> 02:09:50,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the plan, Medford would reap all the benefits intended under the previous idea and still retain control.

1684
02:09:51,670 --> 02:10:00,017
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe it's an effective approach because it clearly spells out each expected item and it could be implemented without unnecessary delay.

1685
02:10:01,218 --> 02:10:03,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it was a good discussion that we had.

1686
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:11,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Christine did a great job working in town with people, Mark and Howard back and forth covering the issues legally.

1687
02:10:12,385 --> 02:10:20,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And with help from, you know, legal in town, I think we've come up with a plan that allows us to go forward and to get this in place.

1688
02:10:21,709 --> 02:10:22,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Take any questions you have.

1689
02:10:22,850 --> 02:10:23,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Russo.

1690
02:10:24,210 --> 02:10:24,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1691
02:10:25,631 --> 02:10:36,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did ask a question in the committee of the whole, which didn't seem relevant at the time because we were going to be doing the work ourselves, but can the RFP legally include that it must be union labor?

1692
02:10:37,336 --> 02:10:39,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Prevailing wage, generally.

1693
02:10:39,477 --> 02:10:40,477
[SPEAKER_10]: We put a prevailing wage.

1694
02:10:43,086 --> 02:10:44,266
[SPEAKER_01]: We put it in the RFP.

1695
02:10:45,307 --> 02:10:47,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything we put in there, the respondent has to accept.

1696
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:51,092
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1697
02:10:58,337 --> 02:11:01,279
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I talk to a union person, is that going to be the same thing?

1698
02:11:01,299 --> 02:11:02,320
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be like, oh, no big deal.

1699
02:11:03,134 --> 02:11:11,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Or... Well, one would think that if they're paying prevailing wage, there's no reason not to use... Of course.

1700
02:11:12,318 --> 02:11:12,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1701
02:11:12,658 --> 02:11:18,860
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I just like, you know, I feel like every week I drive by a giant construction site with people picketing because somebody wanted to get the cheapest wage.

1702
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:20,341
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't go prevailing wage.

1703
02:11:20,881 --> 02:11:25,583
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I just... That would be our goal.

1704
02:11:25,643 --> 02:11:27,304
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done all our projects that way.

1705
02:11:28,574 --> 02:11:32,718
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I did read in the emails that, you know, like all these universities, they seem to think they have no money.

1706
02:11:48,293 --> 02:11:53,456
[SPEAKER_10]: I just worry about cutting corners on the backs of people who are going to be doing the work.

1707
02:11:53,476 --> 02:11:54,497
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to happen.

1708
02:11:54,517 --> 02:11:55,817
[SPEAKER_10]: We get to reap the benefits.

1709
02:11:56,117 --> 02:11:57,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Not going to happen.

1710
02:11:57,458 --> 02:11:57,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1711
02:11:57,898 --> 02:11:58,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1712
02:11:58,899 --> 02:12:01,200
[SPEAKER_18]: That's important.

1713
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:01,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Benedetto.

1714
02:12:02,261 --> 02:12:02,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1715
02:12:02,801 --> 02:12:03,762
[SPEAKER_18]: I had a few questions.

1716
02:12:04,802 --> 02:12:10,105
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Bilson, why in number one, did you emphasize area university?

1717
02:12:11,646 --> 02:12:13,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because in order for it to work,

1718
02:12:14,392 --> 02:12:20,074
[SPEAKER_01]: based on our concept of an interaction with an area university, we would want one in the area.

1719
02:12:20,134 --> 02:12:24,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they weren't in the area, it would become very difficult to have the interaction that we want.

1720
02:12:25,296 --> 02:12:31,178
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably would not be attractive to a non-area university to want to rent one of our facilities.

1721
02:12:31,778 --> 02:12:32,238
[SPEAKER_18]: So I mean, I imagine.

1722
02:12:32,278 --> 02:12:35,659
[SPEAKER_18]: Could you define how far in the area you're talking?

1723
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:38,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Because that way, we're all on the same page.

1724
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:42,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say you've got to have a radius of so many miles.

1725
02:12:43,444 --> 02:12:46,349
[SPEAKER_01]: We could come up with that, but I wouldn't expect it.

1726
02:12:46,389 --> 02:12:48,111
[SPEAKER_19]: We could specify.

1727
02:12:48,131 --> 02:12:48,431
[SPEAKER_19]: 20 miles?

1728
02:12:49,012 --> 02:12:49,773
[SPEAKER_01]: We could specify.

1729
02:12:51,035 --> 02:12:55,742
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd just like to be on the same page with this because interpretation can be

1730
02:12:57,156 --> 02:13:07,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't see us, the benefit to us is to have a university that's accessible to our teachers, accessible to our students, accessible to programs and the like.

1731
02:13:08,925 --> 02:13:12,508
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean- So my next question is in section four.

1732
02:13:13,008 --> 02:13:21,095
[SPEAKER_18]: Why did it change from us being responsible for the renovations and oversight of the renovations to now

1733
02:13:22,106 --> 02:13:32,191
[SPEAKER_01]: because they can go out and do it and attract a vendor without going through multiple layers of, you know, bidding and the like.

1734
02:13:32,972 --> 02:13:36,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And since the money will be the same, I mean, it's up to them.

1735
02:13:36,394 --> 02:13:40,416
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we might even do better because essentially they can work on it.

1736
02:13:40,436 --> 02:13:42,737
[SPEAKER_01]: We can work on the numbers with them.

1737
02:13:43,417 --> 02:13:44,958
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

1738
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:47,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1739
02:13:47,139 --> 02:13:48,000
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

1740
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:48,940
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on the RFP.

1741
02:13:49,381 --> 02:13:49,981
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the RFP.

1742
02:13:50,738 --> 02:13:56,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, my last question is for our attorney that's in the audience tonight.

1743
02:13:56,403 --> 02:14:04,030
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm wondering if this is different in any way than any other RFP that we usually do.

1744
02:14:05,999 --> 02:14:09,482
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you mentioned that you went into town and talked to the people there.

1745
02:14:09,602 --> 02:14:13,324
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done RFPs before, and RFP is a standard operation.

1746
02:14:13,865 --> 02:14:15,426
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it the time frame that's shorter?

1747
02:14:15,466 --> 02:14:19,208
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you made it seem like it was a little bit different than the usual.

1748
02:14:19,229 --> 02:14:20,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a little bit different than we started out.

1749
02:14:21,610 --> 02:14:22,331
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not different.

1750
02:14:22,371 --> 02:14:27,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, RFPs are generally a very interesting tool, because you're not stuck strictly on price.

1751
02:14:27,755 --> 02:14:31,858
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to look at criteria, and you're able to look at who can provide what.

1752
02:14:32,258 --> 02:14:35,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And since this is a lot of qualitative interaction that's involved,

1753
02:14:35,802 --> 02:14:39,805
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to look at the criteria rather than just strictly a dollar factor.

1754
02:14:40,486 --> 02:14:40,986
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1755
02:14:41,326 --> 02:14:46,570
[SPEAKER_18]: And my last question is, is two weeks a typical time frame for an RFP to be posted?

1756
02:14:46,650 --> 02:14:47,191
[SPEAKER_01]: For posting.

1757
02:14:47,471 --> 02:14:47,711
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1758
02:14:47,771 --> 02:14:50,974
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take a little bit more time to actually construct the RFP.

1759
02:14:51,014 --> 02:14:52,215
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to go over it very carefully.

1760
02:14:52,635 --> 02:14:52,895
[SPEAKER_18]: So a week?

1761
02:14:52,915 --> 02:14:54,377
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it's out, it's two weeks.

1762
02:14:54,617 --> 02:14:54,817
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1763
02:14:55,137 --> 02:14:56,959
[SPEAKER_18]: And do we advertise this?

1764
02:14:57,019 --> 02:14:58,019
[SPEAKER_18]: How do we have to?

1765
02:14:58,079 --> 02:14:58,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

1766
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:02,563
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be each week in the newspaper, in a prominent newspaper.

1767
02:15:03,210 --> 02:15:07,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we telling of any of our neighbor communities?

1768
02:15:07,131 --> 02:15:11,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we reaching out and saying, hey, we're looking for a partnership and this is what we're looking for?

1769
02:15:11,913 --> 02:15:14,454
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone shows up that we haven't thought of, let's be interested.

1770
02:15:14,474 --> 02:15:16,115
[SPEAKER_19]: Publicly post it and see what comes back.

1771
02:15:16,135 --> 02:15:16,675
[SPEAKER_19]: Publicly post it.

1772
02:15:17,515 --> 02:15:18,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we may get surprised.

1773
02:15:18,696 --> 02:15:19,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1774
02:15:24,077 --> 02:15:24,738
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1775
02:15:25,338 --> 02:15:26,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just two questions.

1776
02:15:27,138 --> 02:15:31,300
[SPEAKER_11]: The first is on subsection four, where you talk of provisions for quality control.

1777
02:15:32,241 --> 02:15:37,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I, I just, I really do support the idea of doing partnership programs with local universities.

1778
02:15:37,985 --> 02:15:40,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I really commend the administration for working on this.

1779
02:15:40,267 --> 02:15:43,009
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you guys have been cooking this up since like December.

1780
02:15:43,249 --> 02:15:47,292
[SPEAKER_11]: But could you just outline what are the provisions for quality control?

1781
02:15:47,332 --> 02:15:52,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we're allowing them to hire the contractors, how do we really know that they won't shaft us?

1782
02:15:52,856 --> 02:15:54,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's walk through it a little bit.

1783
02:15:54,317 --> 02:15:54,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1784
02:15:54,518 --> 02:15:54,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1785
02:15:55,378 --> 02:16:00,522
[SPEAKER_01]: If an entity wants to use the item, they certainly want to play on something that's quality.

1786
02:16:01,324 --> 02:16:04,548
[SPEAKER_01]: They certainly don't want to play on something that's less than quality if they can help it.

1787
02:16:04,828 --> 02:16:05,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?

1788
02:16:05,549 --> 02:16:07,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, they have to meet NCAA standards.

1789
02:16:08,452 --> 02:16:08,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?

1790
02:16:08,812 --> 02:16:12,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Which will immediately ensure a certain level of quality.

1791
02:16:12,697 --> 02:16:13,918
[SPEAKER_01]: And three, we'll have a clerk of the works.

1792
02:16:14,519 --> 02:16:16,601
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make sure that they follow certain specifications.

1793
02:16:16,621 --> 02:16:16,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1794
02:16:18,310 --> 02:16:31,580
[SPEAKER_11]: And sort of just to branch off Paul's concern, which is my concern as well, I just want to understand, so prevailing wages, how do we know that let's say they find some company, they say, oh, they're prevailing wages, don't worry about it.

1795
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:34,783
[SPEAKER_19]: They submit reports, weekly payroll reports.

1796
02:16:34,823 --> 02:16:36,784
[SPEAKER_11]: All that will be verified and we'll make sure.

1797
02:16:36,964 --> 02:16:37,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1798
02:16:37,345 --> 02:16:37,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

1799
02:16:37,865 --> 02:16:39,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, I just really appreciate all the work you're doing.

1800
02:16:39,386 --> 02:16:41,127
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, it's good that you're asking because I want you to understand.

1801
02:16:41,187 --> 02:16:43,069
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.

1802
02:16:43,189 --> 02:16:44,770
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no disasters.

1803
02:16:44,850 --> 02:16:45,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1804
02:16:46,652 --> 02:16:46,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

1805
02:16:46,832 --> 02:16:47,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Van de Kleef.

1806
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:53,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we get responses to the RFP, let's say that we're surprised, because all of a sudden we've got three.

1807
02:16:54,124 --> 02:16:58,307
[SPEAKER_02]: One's from Salem State, one's from Bunker Hill, and one's from Leslie.

1808
02:16:58,888 --> 02:17:02,850
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, do we get to sit down and look at them and decide which is the best?

1809
02:17:02,870 --> 02:17:03,511
[SPEAKER_01]: We would look at it.

1810
02:17:04,271 --> 02:17:04,912
[SPEAKER_01]: We would look at it.

1811
02:17:05,432 --> 02:17:13,537
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, because it's an RFP, we have a lot of factors with qualitative discretion in it.

1812
02:17:13,738 --> 02:17:14,618
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just price.

1813
02:17:17,116 --> 02:17:22,198
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a university that already has physical facilities, they're not coming to us for another one.

1814
02:17:22,518 --> 02:17:29,322
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a university that doesn't provide certain programs in areas that we're interested in, they're not meeting another criteria.

1815
02:17:30,182 --> 02:17:36,025
[SPEAKER_19]: So... If I could, you establish criteria and then they're graded.

1816
02:17:36,925 --> 02:17:43,048
[SPEAKER_19]: So you might see, contains educational, it's a teaching college, and then you'd say, meets it as a five.

1817
02:17:44,288 --> 02:17:47,469
[SPEAKER_19]: So you put everything into pockets.

1818
02:17:48,049 --> 02:17:53,830
[SPEAKER_19]: And so you're consistently applying your same ratings to each, whoever replies to the RFP.

1819
02:17:53,870 --> 02:17:57,571
[SPEAKER_19]: Because you can't just say, I give you a five, we want you.

1820
02:17:57,671 --> 02:18:01,172
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, you need to document why you're giving them a five versus a four.

1821
02:18:02,753 --> 02:18:10,154
[SPEAKER_02]: So tonight you'd like a motion to go forward with putting together an RFP and putting it out to bid.

1822
02:18:10,774 --> 02:18:11,135
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

1823
02:18:11,295 --> 02:18:12,675
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd make a motion that we

1824
02:18:13,392 --> 02:18:17,136
[SPEAKER_02]: go forward with creating the RFP and then putting it out to bid.

1825
02:18:17,937 --> 02:18:19,278
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a motion on the floor.

1826
02:18:19,298 --> 02:18:27,427
[SPEAKER_19]: It would probably be circulated to you, but it wouldn't come back for an approval.

1827
02:18:29,369 --> 02:18:30,370
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a motion for approval.

1828
02:18:30,410 --> 02:18:31,031
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a second?

1829
02:18:31,251 --> 02:18:31,932
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Russo?

1830
02:18:32,352 --> 02:18:33,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

1831
02:18:33,353 --> 02:18:33,553
[SPEAKER_19]: Krebs.

1832
02:18:43,010 --> 02:18:43,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1833
02:18:44,270 --> 02:18:44,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1834
02:18:44,530 --> 02:18:46,311
[SPEAKER_19]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1835
02:18:46,451 --> 02:18:47,211
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

1836
02:18:47,271 --> 02:18:48,091
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

1837
02:18:48,111 --> 02:18:50,032
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1838
02:18:50,072 --> 02:18:54,393
[SPEAKER_19]: The second item under old business is the middle school selection decision.

1839
02:18:55,554 --> 02:18:55,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1840
02:18:55,814 --> 02:18:56,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Nelson.

1841
02:18:58,895 --> 02:18:59,475
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening.

1842
02:18:59,495 --> 02:19:03,176
[SPEAKER_26]: The update from two weeks ago, we left off

1843
02:19:05,099 --> 02:19:06,400
[SPEAKER_26]: We gave you numbers.

1844
02:19:06,900 --> 02:19:17,064
[SPEAKER_26]: We saw that there was a large imbalance with most, a lot of students, more students going to the Andrews for grade six than the McGlynn.

1845
02:19:17,084 --> 02:19:33,472
[SPEAKER_26]: That was on our meeting May 7th, and it was decided by the committee that we would try, before we go to the partial lottery, we would try one more time to convince people to make the choice and to have more

1846
02:19:33,995 --> 02:19:35,455
[SPEAKER_26]: students go over to the McGlynn.

1847
02:19:35,876 --> 02:19:44,718
[SPEAKER_26]: The very next day, Mrs. Caldwell and I met with the principals, and we drafted a letter that you have attached to the cover sheet.

1848
02:19:45,298 --> 02:20:01,342
[SPEAKER_26]: And the letter basically said to parents and guardians that if they would voluntarily make their, and the letter was just to those parents who had selected the Inders, that if they would make the change to the McGlynn, we would ensure that their children could be with

1849
02:20:01,995 --> 02:20:02,595
[SPEAKER_26]: They're friends.

1850
02:20:02,855 --> 02:20:11,239
[SPEAKER_26]: And so you can see from the sign-up sheet that the list would ask for multiple parents to sign on.

1851
02:20:12,159 --> 02:20:22,604
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, a partial lottery, as we explained, means that you run the risk that your child may not have his or her closest friend with them or their second closest friend.

1852
02:20:23,184 --> 02:20:29,447
[SPEAKER_26]: So we were hoping to convince parents that by keeping your children together, this would be something that they would want to do.

1853
02:20:30,345 --> 02:20:32,505
[SPEAKER_26]: We got some movement on this, but not enough.

1854
02:20:33,546 --> 02:20:52,369
[SPEAKER_26]: Currently, if we look at the numbers, we get five students that originally selected the Andrews from the McGlynn, opted to go back to the McGlynn, and then just, this doesn't reflect actually, because this happened today, we have one additional student at the Columbus who opted to change from the Andrews to the McGlynn.

1855
02:20:52,709 --> 02:20:58,190
[SPEAKER_26]: So we have a movement of six students, which gives us our current latest numbers.

1856
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:06,943
[SPEAKER_26]: The Andrews is 169 and the McGlynn is 124.

1857
02:21:08,583 --> 02:21:10,264
[SPEAKER_26]: So we have an imbalance.

1858
02:21:10,304 --> 02:21:15,807
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to really move students, about 20 students in the other direction.

1859
02:21:16,488 --> 02:21:27,373
[SPEAKER_26]: If you look at the numbers, you can see that all of the elementary schools except the Brooks have opted for at least 20 students to go to the McGlynn.

1860
02:21:28,073 --> 02:21:30,955
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, we're looking to take our next step

1861
02:21:32,889 --> 02:21:35,870
[SPEAKER_26]: We would like to have seen more people voluntarily.

1862
02:21:35,890 --> 02:21:41,512
[SPEAKER_26]: It would just be another 15, 20 people to do that, but so far, they haven't come forward.

1863
02:21:41,532 --> 02:21:45,333
[SPEAKER_26]: We did have a deadline last week, which is, you know, a little bit flexible.

1864
02:21:45,353 --> 02:21:51,055
[SPEAKER_26]: Some parents emailed me, said they got the letters late for whatever reason, and we said, of course, you can take more time.

1865
02:21:51,435 --> 02:21:58,097
[SPEAKER_26]: That was our goal, to have people move voluntarily, but it's not happening, and I think it's time to take the next step.

1866
02:22:01,966 --> 02:22:02,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

1867
02:22:02,987 --> 02:22:03,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Nelson, for your work.

1868
02:22:05,328 --> 02:22:08,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Two things I want to say.

1869
02:22:08,209 --> 02:22:15,152
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, can we make sure that the five students that did voluntarily switch are all placed in the same block if there's no major schedule?

1870
02:22:15,192 --> 02:22:15,733
[SPEAKER_10]: We did.

1871
02:22:15,773 --> 02:22:17,213
[SPEAKER_26]: The parents asked for that.

1872
02:22:17,974 --> 02:22:23,136
[SPEAKER_26]: We went to Mr. Tucci, and we asked that they be on the same team, and he ensured that could be done.

1873
02:22:23,416 --> 02:22:23,757
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1874
02:22:24,117 --> 02:22:28,159
[SPEAKER_10]: And second, you know,

1875
02:22:29,078 --> 02:22:35,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been running the numbers endlessly, and I just wanna make sure that when we do the, I've decided to no longer use the word lottery.

1876
02:22:36,401 --> 02:22:37,402
[SPEAKER_10]: We all know what a lottery is.

1877
02:22:37,442 --> 02:22:42,785
[SPEAKER_10]: We either win or we lose, and I'm going to continue to move forward that both schools are equally good.

1878
02:22:43,705 --> 02:22:48,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm calling everything randomization placement or something along those lines.

1879
02:22:48,327 --> 02:22:58,432
[SPEAKER_10]: But looking at the numbers and making sure that we are selecting the students that will be randomized into the McGlynn,

1880
02:23:01,109 --> 02:23:06,751
[SPEAKER_10]: As you mentioned, Columbus, because of this additional student, needs to send zero more students over.

1881
02:23:06,771 --> 02:23:15,215
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm seeing that if we're going to send 20, then we have to send 17 from the Brooks and three from the Roberts.

1882
02:23:15,275 --> 02:23:26,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to make sure that we are not taking all the students from those schools and then just randomizing them all in that, in fact, proportionally,

1883
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:33,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Roberts will be sending 17 students, but they do not select that school, and three students from the Roberts.

1884
02:23:35,626 --> 02:23:38,469
[SPEAKER_10]: But we can work out the details of how that will actually happen.

1885
02:23:38,489 --> 02:23:51,179
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, as you look at the numbers, I mean, this could be simplified somewhat, because each three of the four elementary schools are sending at least 20 students to the McGlynn.

1886
02:23:51,887 --> 02:24:01,852
[SPEAKER_26]: The only school that is not, and again, those six students that are placed at the Brooks are EL students, I'm sorry, placed at the McGlynn from the Brooks are EL, so that's a given.

1887
02:24:02,753 --> 02:24:10,057
[SPEAKER_26]: But that's the only big discrepancy that you see as you look at the numbers here, but it's how the committee wants to proceed with that.

1888
02:24:10,437 --> 02:24:13,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I just follow up on the report you gave us two weeks ago from the Brooks?

1889
02:24:13,979 --> 02:24:16,961
[SPEAKER_19]: You said six no requests, two ELLs.

1890
02:24:17,261 --> 02:24:19,282
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I guess that was that, yeah.

1891
02:24:21,303 --> 02:24:25,304
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a lot of sheets here.

1892
02:24:25,324 --> 02:24:26,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Benedetto is next.

1893
02:24:27,045 --> 02:24:27,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have a question.

1894
02:24:28,185 --> 02:24:28,245
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1895
02:24:28,385 --> 02:24:28,525
Ms.

1896
02:24:28,585 --> 02:24:29,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Van de Kloot.

1897
02:24:30,606 --> 02:24:33,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to ask a question in a different way.

1898
02:24:33,827 --> 02:24:38,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now we've got 169 kids at the Andrews.

1899
02:24:40,029 --> 02:24:43,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have two teams.

1900
02:24:43,810 --> 02:24:45,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Each team is made up of four classes.

1901
02:24:47,191 --> 02:24:48,772
[SPEAKER_02]: If we do the math, that means

1902
02:24:49,528 --> 02:24:54,250
[SPEAKER_02]: that there would be 21 kids in each of those classes, right?

1903
02:24:54,350 --> 02:24:55,390
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't say that for sure.

1904
02:24:55,430 --> 02:25:04,574
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd have to have the principal here because again, are you talking about core academic classes and then sometimes we have the special education students that filter in.

1905
02:25:05,276 --> 02:25:07,857
[SPEAKER_26]: Class size being 21, I cannot say that's a good one.

1906
02:25:07,877 --> 02:25:10,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was talking about core academic classes.

1907
02:25:10,178 --> 02:25:11,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the two teams.

1908
02:25:11,199 --> 02:25:14,720
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would, it means there would be 85 on each team.

1909
02:25:15,321 --> 02:25:27,206
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, then in the corresponding school, there would be 15 kids in a class if you divide the number by eight, which obviously is great.

1910
02:25:27,807 --> 02:25:31,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we've been very proud of our class size numbers.

1911
02:25:31,789 --> 02:25:34,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, 21 at middle school is not bad.

1912
02:25:36,119 --> 02:25:45,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly for the McGlynn, where we have the EL and newcomers and whatever, it's an advantage to be there because it's smaller class size.

1913
02:25:46,465 --> 02:25:49,706
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the numbers, 21 isn't awful.

1914
02:25:49,866 --> 02:25:53,848
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got many elementary kids' classrooms where there might be 21.

1915
02:25:54,309 --> 02:25:59,071
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just looking at it in a different way and wondering and saying this is causing us a great deal of pain.

1916
02:25:59,231 --> 02:26:01,372
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand how much pain this causes parents.

1917
02:26:03,143 --> 02:26:06,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know in terms of the inequity in terms of our teaching staff.

1918
02:26:07,006 --> 02:26:16,974
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be teachers at the Andrews who feel unfair, but they're still very much within contractual limits.

1919
02:26:17,654 --> 02:26:19,476
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it impacts the exploratories.

1920
02:26:20,517 --> 02:26:26,141
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, you know, when you have these kids now in the exploratories, they're larger groups mixed together.

1921
02:26:26,301 --> 02:26:29,183
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's, I think, is what the issue is.

1922
02:26:29,264 --> 02:26:32,206
[SPEAKER_26]: Because yes, the teams were,

1923
02:26:32,790 --> 02:26:35,192
[SPEAKER_26]: designed to take 100 kids per team.

1924
02:26:35,792 --> 02:26:38,514
[SPEAKER_26]: But it has to do with the exploratories and how that factors in.

1925
02:26:39,795 --> 02:26:45,939
[SPEAKER_26]: The other thing with the Andrews you want to keep in mind is that we also have a pretty big imbalance in grade seven.

1926
02:26:46,339 --> 02:26:52,504
[SPEAKER_26]: So in other words, it's far more kids if we have a large imbalance entering grade six, we have it in grade seven.

1927
02:26:52,944 --> 02:26:56,186
[SPEAKER_26]: Eight is okay, but we have several more students.

1928
02:26:56,246 --> 02:26:59,749
[SPEAKER_26]: We'd have about 60 or 70 more students in that school.

1929
02:27:01,190 --> 02:27:11,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, history has told us that there is a swing, that, I mean, that's, when we looked at the projections over all the years, there was a clear swing.

1930
02:27:11,916 --> 02:27:14,498
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it balanced out amazingly so in the end.

1931
02:27:14,518 --> 02:27:15,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1932
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:19,081
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it a point of information?

1933
02:27:19,581 --> 02:27:20,321
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a clarification.

1934
02:27:20,482 --> 02:27:25,545
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to ask, have you been able to view of any groups

1935
02:27:38,584 --> 02:27:40,806
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was looking at her face.

1936
02:27:41,747 --> 02:27:42,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1937
02:27:43,308 --> 02:27:53,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to point out that we spent a lot of time trying to make sure that the special education population of students are evenly distributed between the two buildings.

1938
02:27:53,816 --> 02:27:57,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of that work has already been taking place.

1939
02:27:58,708 --> 02:28:13,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there is a larger number of students who are not eligible for special education and not ELL students going to one building over the other, it has the effect of elevating the percentage of students who are high needs and require direct services in that same building.

1940
02:28:14,655 --> 02:28:26,140
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, a general education classroom that may have special education students and full inclusion programs, as well as ELL students and full inclusion programs

1941
02:28:26,493 --> 02:28:32,135
[SPEAKER_03]: the class, we really risk having the class being mostly students who are EL and who are special ed.

1942
02:28:33,036 --> 02:28:41,039
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just a consideration when we look at having unequal enrollments at both schools.

1943
02:28:41,519 --> 02:28:54,525
[SPEAKER_03]: The other factor is that a lot of, if we have openings in one school over the other school, as new students move into the district, they tend to be students who are highly mobile, and a lot of those students end up being special education students,

1944
02:28:55,667 --> 02:28:59,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Yale students and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

1945
02:29:00,290 --> 02:29:03,852
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, all of these students come to a school with significant needs.

1946
02:29:03,932 --> 02:29:07,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a factor to consider when we're talking about enrollment numbers.

1947
02:29:08,635 --> 02:29:09,796
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry for interrupting.

1948
02:29:10,336 --> 02:29:10,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1949
02:29:11,537 --> 02:29:11,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I do.

1950
02:29:12,437 --> 02:29:13,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.

1951
02:29:14,178 --> 02:29:23,304
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the difference is if we split them evenly, then our class size is 19 in each versus 21.

1952
02:29:27,227 --> 02:29:29,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So just throwing it out there, because I looked at it differently.

1953
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:36,533
[SPEAKER_26]: There are a lot of issues, and Kathy, I think, has identified one very important.

1954
02:29:36,573 --> 02:29:45,779
[SPEAKER_26]: As we have inclusion, if you have many more SPED students and EL than regular students, then the inclusion is not really what it should be.

1955
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:51,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of the split that currently is in place,

1956
02:29:57,837 --> 02:30:03,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the special education population equally recognized between the two schools?

1957
02:30:03,919 --> 02:30:17,025
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, we went through and we put all the students who need special programs in the proper schools, but then they balanced out the students who need special education services among the two different groups.

1958
02:30:19,385 --> 02:30:20,686
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1959
02:30:20,706 --> 02:30:20,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Darn.

1960
02:30:20,966 --> 02:30:22,307
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry, we did that first.

1961
02:30:23,903 --> 02:30:24,544
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't help but try.

1962
02:30:24,564 --> 02:30:24,664
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

1963
02:30:24,704 --> 02:30:25,044
[SPEAKER_20]: Kress.

1964
02:30:25,965 --> 02:30:26,846
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

1965
02:30:27,146 --> 02:30:34,712
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just have a couple of questions because I've been just looking at this all weekend and just reaching out to some people.

1966
02:30:34,832 --> 02:30:41,018
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I just, you know, is it fair to do like a partial lottery?

1967
02:30:42,299 --> 02:30:43,460
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we do something like that?

1968
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:49,285
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it just seemed very unfair where we're just going to pull the names, you know,

1969
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:50,817
[SPEAKER_20]: How are we going to do that?

1970
02:30:50,877 --> 02:30:52,659
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, I guess I'm confused about that.

1971
02:30:52,759 --> 02:30:59,765
[SPEAKER_20]: Like having a partial lottery, we're going to put all the names into like a lottery system and it's going to kick out.

1972
02:30:59,805 --> 02:31:08,293
[SPEAKER_20]: So every student that applied to the Andrews, it's going to kick out like a report and put them in one school or the other.

1973
02:31:08,313 --> 02:31:10,255
[SPEAKER_20]: Has this ever been done before?

1974
02:31:10,275 --> 02:31:13,297
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Superintendent.

1975
02:31:13,918 --> 02:31:15,039
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's answer it this way.

1976
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:20,083
[SPEAKER_01]: You just heard Kathy Medaglio tell you that they've balanced special ed students.

1977
02:31:20,603 --> 02:31:24,826
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard Paul Teixeira tell you that they've also allocated EL students.

1978
02:31:25,526 --> 02:31:30,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Those students can't go into the partial lottery because they've already been balanced, okay?

1979
02:31:31,310 --> 02:31:34,392
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's left are the students who we'll call typically developing.

1980
02:31:35,072 --> 02:31:42,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Students who have, you know, just basically doing their thing and don't have a designation as either EL or special ed.

1981
02:31:43,402 --> 02:31:44,482
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not part of that balance.

1982
02:31:45,163 --> 02:31:47,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you can look at it in different ways.

1983
02:31:47,563 --> 02:31:54,606
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say that three of the schools have done some of their job, and they've sent some people to the school, and one school didn't.

1984
02:31:55,626 --> 02:31:57,927
[SPEAKER_01]: That's partial lottery going to the school that didn't.

1985
02:31:58,707 --> 02:32:07,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you encourage people perhaps to never send anybody, figuring, well, their chances are better if they don't send anybody.

1986
02:32:08,851 --> 02:32:12,232
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, you can say that you have a school that

1987
02:32:12,635 --> 02:32:15,916
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a natural feeder into the McGlynn.

1988
02:32:15,936 --> 02:32:17,136
[SPEAKER_01]: The McGlynn Elementary is a thing.

1989
02:32:17,176 --> 02:32:21,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could take the 10, 15 kids that are still there and say, well, at least they're still in the same building.

1990
02:32:22,057 --> 02:32:22,817
[SPEAKER_01]: They know the building.

1991
02:32:23,097 --> 02:32:24,318
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another way of looking at it.

1992
02:32:25,238 --> 02:32:29,419
[SPEAKER_01]: A third way to do it would be to take all three of them, put them in the pot, and pull them out.

1993
02:32:29,999 --> 02:32:33,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you do, someone is probably not going to be happy.

1994
02:32:34,140 --> 02:32:42,502
[SPEAKER_01]: During the course of the year, we have heard repeatedly from you about some people that wanted to move from one school to the other.

1995
02:32:43,236 --> 02:32:45,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they had all kinds of issues with that.

1996
02:32:45,878 --> 02:32:48,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, okay, I'm not going to argue that point.

1997
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:49,541
[SPEAKER_01]: They had all kinds of issues with it.

1998
02:32:50,101 --> 02:32:50,882
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's incessant.

1999
02:32:51,662 --> 02:32:56,566
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody who maybe doesn't get what they want is not going to be happy.

2000
02:32:57,286 --> 02:33:01,309
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that we could move some people in cohorts was a good one.

2001
02:33:02,029 --> 02:33:03,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they go with their friends.

2002
02:33:03,651 --> 02:33:08,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's one of the biggest reasons why people go to one school or the other and want to be with their friends.

2003
02:33:09,975 --> 02:33:12,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's another way of looking at the lottery.

2004
02:33:13,405 --> 02:33:18,128
[SPEAKER_01]: If you move the rest of the McGlynn over, they're all with their friends, okay?

2005
02:33:18,769 --> 02:33:28,096
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, in fact, go with some of the other places, you've got to take a significant number of people from one school in order so they have friends.

2006
02:33:28,156 --> 02:33:42,786
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put all three into the pot, there's a chance that, and you're looking only for 15 kids, there's a chance that the school that doesn't send anybody might only have three friends, might only have two kids that anyone knows, because the numbers could skew back to the other people.

2007
02:33:43,372 --> 02:33:47,435
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter what you do, there's going to be a tradeoff someplace.

2008
02:33:47,455 --> 02:33:49,376
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a tradeoff someplace.

2009
02:33:49,857 --> 02:33:51,138
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've just got to decide.

2010
02:33:51,738 --> 02:33:53,339
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just got to decide what's going to work.

2011
02:33:53,980 --> 02:33:55,361
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both good schools.

2012
02:33:56,061 --> 02:33:57,762
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have the same curriculum.

2013
02:33:58,543 --> 02:34:01,445
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have people that will give them leadership.

2014
02:34:02,266 --> 02:34:09,311
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to us as a school system to work hard to rebuild some of the thinking and work at it.

2015
02:34:10,292 --> 02:34:12,273
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got to make a decision because we've got to get on with it.

2016
02:34:12,836 --> 02:34:18,179
[SPEAKER_01]: because people are scheduling, there's resources that have to be allocated, we're working on a budget, and we gotta know what we're doing.

2017
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:22,421
[SPEAKER_20]: I just had one more question.

2018
02:34:22,801 --> 02:34:27,243
[SPEAKER_20]: So is the sibling rule, will that be affected?

2019
02:34:27,283 --> 02:34:37,529
[SPEAKER_20]: So if somebody had a sibling or has a sibling at one of the schools, will those people be put into the partial lottery?

2020
02:34:38,089 --> 02:34:39,870
[SPEAKER_20]: And is there like a time period?

2021
02:34:40,895 --> 02:34:50,182
[SPEAKER_20]: somebody had a sibling two to three years ago, but that sibling moved up to high school, is that still considered a sibling that went to the Andrews?

2022
02:34:50,202 --> 02:34:50,242
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2023
02:34:50,342 --> 02:34:50,503
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2024
02:34:50,623 --> 02:34:50,903
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

2025
02:34:50,923 --> 02:34:51,724
[SPEAKER_19]: It has to be in the school.

2026
02:34:51,744 --> 02:34:52,444
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stretching it.

2027
02:34:52,464 --> 02:34:53,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now, currently in the school.

2028
02:34:53,925 --> 02:34:54,165
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2029
02:34:54,205 --> 02:34:54,906
[SPEAKER_01]: That's stretching it.

2030
02:34:56,347 --> 02:34:56,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2031
02:34:57,648 --> 02:34:59,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've taken care of siblings at this point, haven't we?

2032
02:34:59,870 --> 02:35:04,073
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, we want to make sure that if we went with the partial Lottery I school that we accounted for that.

2033
02:35:04,614 --> 02:35:06,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we took a good eye to look at siblings.

2034
02:35:06,836 --> 02:35:10,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus, there's going to be a few new people coming in, you know, between now and the end of the year, and a few people leaving.

2035
02:35:10,979 --> 02:35:11,700
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to happen, too.

2036
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:13,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2037
02:35:15,563 --> 02:35:16,184
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Ruggiero.

2038
02:35:16,724 --> 02:35:17,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2039
02:35:18,486 --> 02:35:22,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know the administration is working very hard to deal with this problem.

2040
02:35:22,068 --> 02:35:25,511
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate to funnel Cassandra, but this is a very frustrating report to me.

2041
02:35:26,032 --> 02:35:33,538
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we all kind of hoped it would go away, but here we are now at the last minute with no options of really solving it other than

2042
02:35:34,531 --> 02:35:43,097
[SPEAKER_11]: take them all from Brooks, which means that 33% of one out of every three kids that applied to go to the Andrews might get sent to the McGlynn.

2043
02:35:43,637 --> 02:35:45,379
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it means, one out of every three.

2044
02:35:45,599 --> 02:36:01,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Or we take 11% out of the general population, and we say to the 16 kids that go to McGlynn Elementary that they're just, you know, even though that they want to go to Andrews, you know, they went to the McGlynn, they kind of want to do something new, you know, we're saying you also have to

2045
02:36:02,304 --> 02:36:04,786
[SPEAKER_11]: to handle that, so this is a very frustrating report to me.

2046
02:36:05,366 --> 02:36:16,235
[SPEAKER_11]: What's most frustrating about this whole point is sort of this false choice that's being laid out in front of us that, oh, you can choose, but they're equal.

2047
02:36:16,275 --> 02:36:17,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Then why are you choosing?

2048
02:36:18,256 --> 02:36:23,300
[SPEAKER_11]: If these schools are equivalent, they're truly equivalent, then why choose?

2049
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:29,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we have more room for ELL students at one school, I understand that, but it's just everyone's randomly drawn.

2050
02:36:31,579 --> 02:36:33,840
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, or there's a reason to choose one school.

2051
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:45,104
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, maybe having, I love the idea of having a Haitian Creole magnet school in Medford, make us unique in Massachusetts, but that's a huge investment of time and energy.

2052
02:36:45,164 --> 02:36:46,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we could do a math magnet.

2053
02:36:46,865 --> 02:36:49,306
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be easier to draw our STEM magnet.

2054
02:36:49,966 --> 02:36:54,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Might be easier to create one school has more of a STEM focus, and the school has more of a liberal arts focus.

2055
02:36:55,568 --> 02:37:00,990
[SPEAKER_11]: These are choices that we could have made, and now here we are at the 11th hour, and those choices are,

2056
02:37:01,471 --> 02:37:03,232
[SPEAKER_11]: not in front of us anymore.

2057
02:37:03,352 --> 02:37:06,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we've talked about all these things, Mike.

2058
02:37:06,594 --> 02:37:09,516
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't like, you know, this is the first time we're discussing it.

2059
02:37:09,536 --> 02:37:10,917
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been going on for a year.

2060
02:37:11,717 --> 02:37:19,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality is there are some dynamic forces in the background that created maybe some preferences that are there.

2061
02:37:19,903 --> 02:37:23,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, historically, balance has shifted between the places.

2062
02:37:24,325 --> 02:37:28,328
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hopeful with some changes at one school that

2063
02:37:29,123 --> 02:37:30,684
[SPEAKER_01]: This won't be a permanent situation.

2064
02:37:30,724 --> 02:37:31,345
[SPEAKER_01]: This will change.

2065
02:37:32,967 --> 02:37:44,437
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any one point in time, at any one point in time, is it necessary, what do you call it, to, you know, hang our heads and say we didn't do it?

2066
02:37:44,777 --> 02:37:47,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is choice more important right now than

2067
02:37:48,130 --> 02:37:53,393
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure the schools are balanced so the teachers have enough kids in the classroom, and we need to move forward.

2068
02:37:53,453 --> 02:37:54,914
[SPEAKER_11]: That's our choice.

2069
02:37:54,934 --> 02:37:55,474
[SPEAKER_11]: That's our choice.

2070
02:37:55,514 --> 02:37:55,954
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand.

2071
02:37:56,034 --> 02:37:59,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to take someone to the woodshed here, and that's not my intent.

2072
02:37:59,996 --> 02:38:04,859
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what's frustrating to me about this report is I think it was kind of obvious.

2073
02:38:05,279 --> 02:38:06,260
[SPEAKER_11]: We all kind of saw it coming.

2074
02:38:06,280 --> 02:38:08,881
[SPEAKER_11]: We just hoped it wouldn't be here at the 11th hour.

2075
02:38:09,601 --> 02:38:11,082
[SPEAKER_11]: What I would like to suggest is this.

2076
02:38:11,602 --> 02:38:16,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, no matter what we decide, it's going to cause a little bit of trouble.

2077
02:38:17,125 --> 02:38:29,390
[SPEAKER_11]: But it seems like if we expect that every school sort of has a reasonable distribution, it seems only fair to me that the Brooks School would be, you know, we say 17 or 20 kids have to go.

2078
02:38:30,271 --> 02:38:39,815
[SPEAKER_11]: And that just, you know, maybe that seems, you know, when we think of like what is fair for the community, is it fair for the entire community to say,

2079
02:38:40,428 --> 02:38:43,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you know, you're at the McGlynn Elementary.

2080
02:38:43,190 --> 02:38:44,551
[SPEAKER_11]: There's 16 kids there.

2081
02:38:44,911 --> 02:38:47,553
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, these are people that, friends that want to be together.

2082
02:38:48,394 --> 02:38:52,417
[SPEAKER_11]: They also should share, even though their school doesn't have this problem.

2083
02:38:52,497 --> 02:38:58,722
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the future, I would really like to start considering more seriously the idea that there is a choice to be made.

2084
02:38:58,822 --> 02:39:01,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, there isn't, right?

2085
02:39:01,083 --> 02:39:02,885
[SPEAKER_11]: We're saying they're equal, they're both great.

2086
02:39:03,525 --> 02:39:04,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it's a false choice.

2087
02:39:05,186 --> 02:39:07,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's have a reason for kids to go to one school versus the other.

2088
02:39:07,828 --> 02:39:08,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we want to be careful.

2089
02:39:08,549 --> 02:39:10,010
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of people got their choice.

2090
02:39:10,852 --> 02:39:12,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a percentage right now.

2091
02:39:12,734 --> 02:39:14,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you could use the NBA rule.

2092
02:39:14,956 --> 02:39:16,197
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to play the NBA game?

2093
02:39:16,737 --> 02:39:20,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas some schools have a weighted number versus other schools.

2094
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:25,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might say that a school that has no one going there would have to send more.

2095
02:39:25,925 --> 02:39:31,109
[SPEAKER_01]: A second school might send, you know, which has more kids going, might send less, a smaller percentage.

2096
02:39:31,650 --> 02:39:36,134
[SPEAKER_01]: And a third school, which has even more going, might send an even smaller percentage so that no school

2097
02:39:37,055 --> 02:39:37,976
[SPEAKER_01]: gets hit totally.

2098
02:39:38,176 --> 02:39:40,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I am in strong support of a weighted average option.

2099
02:39:41,939 --> 02:39:43,660
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be another way to play it.

2100
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:48,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it seems only fair that we expect every school to basically feed into one.

2101
02:39:48,143 --> 02:39:53,367
[SPEAKER_11]: And unfortunately, that means one school will have more of a percentage of kids broken up.

2102
02:39:53,607 --> 02:39:58,751
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think the ELLs have to be called out because they're forced to go to one over another.

2103
02:39:58,811 --> 02:40:02,373
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think you should pull out the ELLs, then look at the proportion.

2104
02:40:04,294 --> 02:40:09,937
[SPEAKER_26]: We want to be careful, you know, that we promised people we were going to do something a certain way with the initial letters.

2105
02:40:10,137 --> 02:40:14,239
[SPEAKER_26]: And those initial letters, which the committee agreed on, would have two steps.

2106
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:18,522
[SPEAKER_26]: Step one would be the choice, because nobody really wanted to yank that away totally.

2107
02:40:18,582 --> 02:40:20,303
[SPEAKER_26]: We wanted to see how it worked out.

2108
02:40:20,343 --> 02:40:25,945
[SPEAKER_26]: But we also, in that initial letter, said if it didn't work out equitably, we would go to a partial lottery.

2109
02:40:26,506 --> 02:40:32,469
[SPEAKER_26]: To go back and to develop something different, like take all the McGlynn kids and make them go, doesn't seem fair to me.

2110
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:43,607
[SPEAKER_26]: The biggest objection, you know, this summer when we listened to people that were upset if they didn't get the school of their choice, the objection was, my child's not going to be with any of their friends.

2111
02:40:44,247 --> 02:40:54,273
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think, if possible, trying to keep, you know, as much as possible, large groups of kids going to each school so they have a friend.

2112
02:40:54,653 --> 02:40:58,876
[SPEAKER_26]: Because that's what we felt kids wanted, to be with their friends.

2113
02:40:59,256 --> 02:41:01,938
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's why we were hoping the second,

2114
02:41:02,772 --> 02:41:06,035
[SPEAKER_26]: here choosing a cohort would be a little bit better.

2115
02:41:06,095 --> 02:41:11,679
[SPEAKER_26]: All we needed was another three cohorts, and we would not be having this discussion this evening.

2116
02:41:12,179 --> 02:41:16,182
[SPEAKER_26]: But right now we don't have them, and so here we are, having the discussion.

2117
02:41:16,422 --> 02:41:20,045
[SPEAKER_26]: But we need to go back to what we told parents originally, too, and I think that's important.

2118
02:41:20,546 --> 02:41:21,206
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Russo.

2119
02:41:23,027 --> 02:41:26,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So, thank you to my colleague.

2120
02:41:29,652 --> 02:41:30,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that

2121
02:41:31,100 --> 02:41:42,049
[SPEAKER_10]: we really need to have a conversation, perhaps as a committee of the whole, not right now, please, about just removing choice 100% and just being done with it.

2122
02:41:42,669 --> 02:41:46,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I keep hearing how the balance swings back and forth.

2123
02:41:46,932 --> 02:41:56,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And magnet options, like if you create a magnet stem on math, it's like, well, I'm going to have 250 kids that want to go to the McGlynn with the magnet stem stuff.

2124
02:41:56,640 --> 02:42:00,623
[SPEAKER_10]: And the swinging back and forth to me is like,

2125
02:42:01,205 --> 02:42:03,866
[SPEAKER_10]: for one second in the middle of the pendulum, it's good.

2126
02:42:03,906 --> 02:42:07,086
[SPEAKER_10]: And then otherwise, we're all talking about this stuff endlessly.

2127
02:42:07,106 --> 02:42:15,088
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only real way to get rid of this is to get rid of choice.

2128
02:42:18,629 --> 02:42:29,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think that the idea of trying to find, if we send 17 of the Brooks fifth graders, I think it's too much to ask that you try to make sure that those 17

2129
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:31,880
[SPEAKER_10]: know each other.

2130
02:42:31,900 --> 02:42:34,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the time for that is over.

2131
02:42:34,302 --> 02:42:39,806
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you said that the Brooks parents did not get the form, then I think we would have a reason to talk.

2132
02:42:39,826 --> 02:42:40,126
[SPEAKER_10]: They did.

2133
02:42:40,146 --> 02:42:40,847
[SPEAKER_10]: They got the form.

2134
02:42:41,007 --> 02:42:47,371
[SPEAKER_10]: But they did get the form, and they did not return the form saying they cared whether their children would go with their friends enough to choose the McGlynn.

2135
02:42:48,031 --> 02:42:51,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is what they said by not returning the form, whether they want to admit it or not.

2136
02:42:52,214 --> 02:43:00,300
[SPEAKER_10]: So they are going to risk that their kid will go to McGlynn, or they'll move from Medford, or whatever their other solution is.

2137
02:43:01,297 --> 02:43:02,858
[SPEAKER_10]: rather than choosing the McGlynn.

2138
02:43:03,518 --> 02:43:21,389
[SPEAKER_10]: And this committee cannot pretend that maintaining anything other than both schools are actually equal, which I believe completely, and which is why I'm comfortable saying choice is a ridiculous idea.

2139
02:43:23,690 --> 02:43:28,353
[SPEAKER_10]: For non-ELL and non, I understand the programmatic

2140
02:43:29,030 --> 02:43:32,493
[SPEAKER_10]: placement is required and for now because of budgets and a lot of other stuff.

2141
02:43:32,533 --> 02:43:53,889
[SPEAKER_10]: So at this point, I mean, you know, I'd like to make a motion that we go to the lottery and that 17 children from the Brooks are selected for the, I used percentage of rising fifth graders for each of the schools to try and get it, to make it proportional.

2142
02:43:55,470 --> 02:43:58,252
[SPEAKER_10]: So while it's true that the Brooks sent the least number,

2143
02:43:58,837 --> 02:44:04,859
[SPEAKER_10]: they don't need to send 20 to be proportional to the other schools, and that three children from the Roberts are sent.

2144
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:08,501
[SPEAKER_28]: Just so we all know how you did it.

2145
02:44:09,361 --> 02:44:13,003
[SPEAKER_10]: It's three pages long, my math, and I'm happy to share it afterwards.

2146
02:44:13,023 --> 02:44:18,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so you would do a percent of the number of fifth graders in each of the four elementary schools?

2147
02:44:19,165 --> 02:44:24,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct, I used the percentage of rising fifth graders, and then McGlynn,

2148
02:44:24,926 --> 02:44:26,407
[SPEAKER_10]: has offset that somewhat.

2149
02:44:26,527 --> 02:44:34,393
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Brooks has 22% of rising fifth graders, Columbus has 20%, Roberts has 28%, and McGlynn has 30.

2150
02:44:35,454 --> 02:44:42,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the McGlynn's overselection is reducing the need for us to choose children from the other schools.

2151
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:52,326
[SPEAKER_10]: The number of students from the Columbus that selected the McGlynn and the Andrews is actually exactly the right number, 20%.

2152
02:44:54,518 --> 02:44:56,580
[SPEAKER_10]: of the total they split.

2153
02:44:58,001 --> 02:45:03,985
[SPEAKER_10]: The Columbus is the only school that has exactly the right number of students going to each of the two schools.

2154
02:45:05,286 --> 02:45:07,868
[SPEAKER_10]: The Roberts is short four, and the Brooks is short 18.

2155
02:45:07,988 --> 02:45:10,370
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not following your math.

2156
02:45:11,091 --> 02:45:13,613
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have 294 rising fifth graders.

2157
02:45:13,633 --> 02:45:15,934
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you pulling out the ELLs?

2158
02:45:15,994 --> 02:45:16,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you including them?

2159
02:45:17,095 --> 02:45:17,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

2160
02:45:17,536 --> 02:45:19,077
[SPEAKER_10]: They won't be included in the lottery.

2161
02:45:19,935 --> 02:45:22,756
[SPEAKER_19]: But are they in your numbers of factors of who's being sent?

2162
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:24,997
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the ELLs have to go one way.

2163
02:45:25,557 --> 02:45:26,418
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no choice.

2164
02:45:27,098 --> 02:45:32,720
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's not a problem because there are not 18 ELL students at the Bronx that are rising fifth graders.

2165
02:45:33,060 --> 02:45:33,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Only two.

2166
02:45:34,321 --> 02:45:34,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

2167
02:45:35,201 --> 02:45:45,886
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have 65 rising fifth graders, 41 of them have, I'm sorry, six of them have selected or are going to the McGlynn.

2168
02:45:45,966 --> 02:45:47,126
[SPEAKER_19]: It's under 10%.

2169
02:45:47,186 --> 02:45:47,366
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

2170
02:45:50,297 --> 02:45:57,601
[SPEAKER_10]: The other 59 rising fifth graders at the anchors will go into the lottery, lottery, the randomized selection.

2171
02:45:59,282 --> 02:46:01,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And 17 of those students will go to MacLennan.

2172
02:46:02,904 --> 02:46:04,825
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's proportional.

2173
02:46:04,845 --> 02:46:07,226
[SPEAKER_26]: So 17 from the Brooks and three from the Roberts?

2174
02:46:07,746 --> 02:46:09,367
[SPEAKER_10]: 17 from the Brooks, I just said MacLennan, sorry.

2175
02:46:09,667 --> 02:46:11,888
[SPEAKER_10]: And three from the Roberts, correct.

2176
02:46:11,949 --> 02:46:12,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Three from the Roberts.

2177
02:46:13,149 --> 02:46:14,830
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will share these with all the math.

2178
02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:18,332
[SPEAKER_10]: But member Kretz asked the question about is this fair?

2179
02:46:18,913 --> 02:46:23,694
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, I had to really work on what the principle was to even begin this math.

2180
02:46:24,175 --> 02:46:30,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only principle I could come up with is that all elementary schools will send precisely half of their rising fifth graders to each school.

2181
02:46:30,916 --> 02:46:33,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they don't have to actually do that, thanks to the McGlynn.

2182
02:46:34,978 --> 02:46:44,400
[SPEAKER_10]: But going forward, we might wanna rethink whether the McGlynn, you know, that's a different conversation about the K through eight kind of model.

2183
02:46:44,660 --> 02:46:46,341
[SPEAKER_10]: But if that's the principle,

2184
02:46:47,702 --> 02:46:49,383
[SPEAKER_10]: then those are the numbers.

2185
02:46:49,403 --> 02:46:51,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not complicated at all, actually.

2186
02:47:31,398 --> 02:47:33,219
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I think we can get just closer.

2187
02:47:33,239 --> 02:47:36,740
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I think 15, we'd be comfortable with 15.

2188
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:41,222
[SPEAKER_26]: Because again, if you had 20 moving, you'd have 149 to 144.

2189
02:47:42,022 --> 02:47:45,583
[SPEAKER_26]: You don't really have to just have that limited differential.

2190
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:53,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, Mr. Russo has the floor.

2191
02:47:53,401 --> 02:48:02,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to point out, though, if it's any number 18 or under, they are all coming from the Brooks.

2192
02:48:05,007 --> 02:48:05,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so we're clear.

2193
02:48:06,108 --> 02:48:11,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you can bring it down to 15, that just means there are three less parents who are angry at the Brooks.

2194
02:48:11,831 --> 02:48:14,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Azzurro, please, we have to follow order.

2195
02:48:14,552 --> 02:48:16,273
[SPEAKER_19]: There's others that are in the queue here.

2196
02:48:16,293 --> 02:48:20,095
[SPEAKER_19]: Does anyone else want to comment on Mr. Russo's recommendation?

2197
02:48:23,351 --> 02:48:23,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

2198
02:48:23,531 --> 02:48:23,791
[SPEAKER_19]: Kretz?

2199
02:48:24,711 --> 02:48:25,472
[SPEAKER_19]: On Mr. Russo's?

2200
02:48:27,692 --> 02:48:40,735
[SPEAKER_20]: In regards to the fairness in the way that you were talking about doing the lottery, so I kind of don't agree with doing the lottery with just the Brooke School.

2201
02:48:40,855 --> 02:48:42,296
[SPEAKER_20]: It just seems so unfair.

2202
02:48:42,396 --> 02:48:47,577
[SPEAKER_20]: I know they didn't make that selection, but we do have school choice in Medford.

2203
02:48:47,977 --> 02:48:52,238
[SPEAKER_20]: So the families from that school sent in their selection form

2204
02:48:52,698 --> 02:48:53,959
[SPEAKER_20]: because we had the school choice.

2205
02:48:54,399 --> 02:49:04,884
[SPEAKER_20]: And when we were talking about doing the lottery, we never really talked about that maybe one school would have a lottery.

2206
02:49:04,904 --> 02:49:19,251
[SPEAKER_20]: So the way that I read this packet was it says here, all the students who have selected the Andrews, all of them, will be randomly selected to move to the McGlynn based on class size.

2207
02:49:19,532 --> 02:49:21,412
[SPEAKER_20]: They'll be put into the partial lottery.

2208
02:49:22,971 --> 02:49:28,853
[SPEAKER_20]: I just, I don't really like the idea of doing a lottery for just one school.

2209
02:49:28,933 --> 02:49:30,414
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, that just, it sounds horrible.

2210
02:49:30,454 --> 02:49:32,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, I just think it just sounds horrible.

2211
02:49:32,255 --> 02:49:39,818
[SPEAKER_20]: But I know they didn't make the choice, and it didn't, I know, I get it, it's just something that I'm just having a hard time with.

2212
02:49:39,838 --> 02:49:41,398
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of information, Mr. Russo.

2213
02:49:42,178 --> 02:49:49,021
[SPEAKER_10]: All the schools will go through the lottery, but the number of students that need to come from the other schools is zero.

2214
02:49:51,615 --> 02:49:53,156
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a semantic thing.

2215
02:49:54,077 --> 02:49:55,578
[SPEAKER_10]: All the schools go through the lottery.

2216
02:49:55,618 --> 02:49:58,320
[SPEAKER_10]: The other schools send enough so they don't need to send more.

2217
02:49:58,620 --> 02:50:06,145
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not that the other schools aren't going through the lottery, it's just that they don't need to send any more kids, to be fair, so we don't pick any of their kids.

2218
02:50:06,465 --> 02:50:20,195
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not gonna take all the kids that selected Andrews through the whole district, stick them in a pile, and make all of them have an equal chance of going to the Andrews, because that would be incredibly unfair.

2219
02:50:24,897 --> 02:50:33,624
[SPEAKER_01]: The plan you approved when we put this in front of you was a partial lottery, and the partial lottery spoke to the issue of disproportionality.

2220
02:50:34,365 --> 02:50:37,207
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually listed the concept of disproportionality.

2221
02:50:37,247 --> 02:50:41,731
[SPEAKER_01]: If one place did not send anybody, then that place would be the partial lottery.

2222
02:50:41,771 --> 02:50:43,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it's a total lottery.

2223
02:50:44,273 --> 02:50:51,118
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get around it a little bit by saying, okay, we'll wait it a little bit.

2224
02:50:52,005 --> 02:50:54,987
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, to some degree, because it's an experimental year.

2225
02:50:56,549 --> 02:51:03,014
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some point, you've got to deal with the concept of partial lottery, which is based on disproportionality.

2226
02:51:05,315 --> 02:51:13,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one other point you want to make is that if you send, let's say you only send two kids from the Brooks, then what are you going to hear?

2227
02:51:13,542 --> 02:51:14,382
[SPEAKER_01]: My kid has no friends.

2228
02:51:15,623 --> 02:51:18,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you send a group over there, at least you've got, the kid's got some friends.

2229
02:51:19,607 --> 02:51:21,248
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, you know, that's a thought.

2230
02:51:22,598 --> 02:51:24,339
[SPEAKER_19]: There's others in the queue first.

2231
02:51:25,079 --> 02:51:26,220
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to shut you guys off.

2232
02:51:26,660 --> 02:51:26,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2233
02:51:27,401 --> 02:51:27,601
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

2234
02:51:27,641 --> 02:51:29,282
[SPEAKER_19]: Vander Kloot.

2235
02:51:29,302 --> 02:51:39,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So along that same line of thinking, we have said six kids need to go to the McGlynn because of their program, the ELL program.

2236
02:51:42,709 --> 02:51:44,790
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have any additional friends there.

2237
02:51:45,310 --> 02:51:46,831
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been made to go to a program.

2238
02:51:47,771 --> 02:51:50,753
[SPEAKER_02]: So frankly, they're pretty isolated from their group of friends.

2239
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:54,561
[SPEAKER_19]: Where are you getting the six from?

2240
02:51:54,621 --> 02:51:55,081
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

2241
02:51:55,181 --> 02:51:59,383
[SPEAKER_02]: The six who are going to the... Two.

2242
02:51:59,403 --> 02:51:59,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Two?

2243
02:51:59,604 --> 02:52:00,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Two are ELL.

2244
02:52:00,824 --> 02:52:04,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Six didn't request anything and they're going... Oh, okay.

2245
02:52:04,706 --> 02:52:05,567
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so then... Two.

2246
02:52:05,807 --> 02:52:06,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's two.

2247
02:52:06,787 --> 02:52:10,789
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, it's not a lot of familiar faces, so... I don't know.

2248
02:52:11,990 --> 02:52:14,211
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to get some people walking into the 12th Tower.

2249
02:52:14,351 --> 02:52:18,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the summer, you're going to have some walk-ins and you're going to have some people leaving.

2250
02:52:18,553 --> 02:52:19,934
[SPEAKER_01]: But the number's not going to be great.

2251
02:52:20,720 --> 02:52:22,581
[SPEAKER_01]: change the balance, but you will get a few more.

2252
02:52:22,962 --> 02:52:24,643
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyone new coming in is going to move on.

2253
02:52:24,683 --> 02:52:27,585
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that simple.

2254
02:52:27,625 --> 02:52:28,185
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Benedetto.

2255
02:52:30,167 --> 02:52:37,632
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't push my button, but I think it's a tough call for this committee.

2256
02:52:37,672 --> 02:52:44,377
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just listening to some of the members on the committee with children close to this age.

2257
02:52:44,437 --> 02:52:50,401
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just taking in the information at this point and just seeing what's best for the community as a whole.

2258
02:52:50,774 --> 02:53:03,098
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that both schools are very good schools in that eventually people will be happy, but I think it's difficult for any parent or any child to swallow a change this late in the year.

2259
02:53:03,859 --> 02:53:10,541
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope that we move to make a total lottery at some point for these schools.

2260
02:53:11,241 --> 02:53:14,002
[SPEAKER_18]: And my colleague, Ms.

2261
02:53:14,022 --> 02:53:16,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Stone, called that way back when.

2262
02:53:17,538 --> 02:53:18,879
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was like, you're crazy.

2263
02:53:19,519 --> 02:53:33,088
[SPEAKER_18]: And she actually turned out to be right on the money, and she was getting phone calls on the way to that last meeting saying, don't you vote for a lottery by people that have supported her through the years.

2264
02:53:33,168 --> 02:53:37,050
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm sitting here, and that's what I'm thinking.

2265
02:53:37,571 --> 02:53:39,612
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm hoping to learn.

2266
02:53:40,212 --> 02:53:40,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2267
02:53:42,614 --> 02:53:42,794
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

2268
02:53:42,854 --> 02:53:43,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Kritz?

2269
02:53:43,495 --> 02:53:44,235
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2270
02:53:44,615 --> 02:53:47,357
[SPEAKER_20]: I did want to mention that I did

2271
02:53:47,660 --> 02:54:00,663
[SPEAKER_20]: like when Dr. Vincent mentioned a long-term plan of having grades five to six at one middle school and seven to eight at another middle school, is that something that we could talk about for the future?

2272
02:54:00,723 --> 02:54:07,765
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it's not something, because I was even thinking it was something that was more doable, but then I said, oh, grade five, no, no, they're in elementary right now.

2273
02:54:08,105 --> 02:54:12,246
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think that's something that maybe we could talk about for next year in that.

2274
02:54:13,995 --> 02:54:15,976
[SPEAKER_20]: would be, we wouldn't have to do a lottery.

2275
02:54:15,996 --> 02:54:17,217
[SPEAKER_19]: For next year, yep.

2276
02:54:17,998 --> 02:54:18,398
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2277
02:54:18,558 --> 02:54:19,459
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Ruggiero.

2278
02:54:20,019 --> 02:54:20,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just two points.

2279
02:54:20,980 --> 02:54:23,501
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, first, I just want to address the community at large.

2280
02:54:23,722 --> 02:54:26,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, this is not a choice anyone here wants to make.

2281
02:54:26,363 --> 02:54:29,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone wants everyone to get what they want or, you know, with their kids.

2282
02:54:31,056 --> 02:54:33,377
[SPEAKER_11]: just talking about sort of the choice.

2283
02:54:33,477 --> 02:54:34,437
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to have to do a lottery.

2284
02:54:34,758 --> 02:54:36,238
[SPEAKER_11]: We're basically forced into this choice.

2285
02:54:36,258 --> 02:54:38,839
[SPEAKER_11]: The question is, what is most fair and what is best?

2286
02:54:39,459 --> 02:54:47,623
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we can all kind of agree that what's most fair is sending kids from the school that is only sending 9% of their students.

2287
02:54:48,703 --> 02:54:53,185
[SPEAKER_11]: What's best also, though, if we're trying to prevent friends from being broken up,

2288
02:54:54,077 --> 02:54:55,318
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the best way to do it.

2289
02:54:55,838 --> 02:55:11,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Have one school that's not sending their kids actually make, because the probability, if you have three buddies, of two of them getting selected, so at least you have Tom, you might not have Bob, but at least you have Tom with you, is much, much better.

2290
02:55:12,290 --> 02:55:23,738
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we have a system where 11% of every school is dropped off, we're going to be breaking up friendships, and the likelihood is they're not going to have cohorts with them.

2291
02:55:24,573 --> 02:55:31,597
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that we're looking at, we're surveying what's not only best and fairest, but what is best for the kids.

2292
02:55:32,037 --> 02:55:40,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really do believe that this plan of Paul's, which is something we're kind of cooking up with two minds while he worked in parallel, I guess is the phrase.

2293
02:55:41,123 --> 02:55:43,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like this is the best way forward.

2294
02:55:44,104 --> 02:55:46,005
[SPEAKER_11]: It's best for the students and it's fairest.

2295
02:55:50,888 --> 02:55:52,029
[SPEAKER_19]: So your recommendation is?

2296
02:55:58,009 --> 02:56:15,001
[SPEAKER_10]: 17 eligible children from the Brooks be randomized into the McGlynn, and that three children from the Roberts be randomized, three eligible children from the Roberts be randomized into the McGlynn.

2297
02:56:16,523 --> 02:56:18,204
[SPEAKER_11]: May I make a friendly amendment to that?

2298
02:56:18,724 --> 02:56:20,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Friendly amendment, Mr. Ruggiero.

2299
02:56:20,405 --> 02:56:24,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it possible, seeing that we only need 17 students, would be acceptable?

2300
02:56:25,777 --> 02:56:31,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, when I, and maybe that's the wrong thing to say, I'm sorry, I'm so used to that stuff.

2301
02:56:32,243 --> 02:56:37,628
[SPEAKER_10]: When I had emailed, an even distribution would be 23 students to each of those.

2302
02:56:38,189 --> 02:56:41,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I emailed to ask, does it really need to be 23, and I got 20.

2303
02:56:42,272 --> 02:56:49,679
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I'm hearing 17 or 15, so if I'm a parent whose kid might get selected into the school that they didn't want,

2304
02:56:50,993 --> 02:56:51,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it 23?

2305
02:56:52,094 --> 02:56:52,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it 20?

2306
02:56:52,675 --> 02:56:53,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it 19, 17, 15?

2307
02:56:53,916 --> 02:56:57,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to 13, because then my kid wouldn't have been 14.

2308
02:56:58,000 --> 02:56:59,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's ask the administration.

2309
02:56:59,241 --> 02:57:00,762
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the experts right before us.

2310
02:57:00,783 --> 02:57:02,564
[SPEAKER_10]: So what is the real number?

2311
02:57:02,584 --> 02:57:07,229
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have to pick a number, because it isn't just unimportant.

2312
02:57:07,509 --> 02:57:10,292
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really important for whoever happens to be there.

2313
02:57:10,872 --> 02:57:14,275
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll know who those kids are, because it's going to be 1, 2, 3, 4.

2314
02:57:16,235 --> 02:57:17,917
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number doesn't have to be perfect.

2315
02:57:17,997 --> 02:57:21,060
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never perfect one-to-one every year, even when it was working well.

2316
02:57:21,981 --> 02:57:29,929
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get a number that brings it closer, and you have less pain that you're inflicting on people that might not want it, you probably can live with 15.

2317
02:57:29,969 --> 02:57:34,213
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably could live with 15, and then there'll be other kids coming in during the summer.

2318
02:57:36,035 --> 02:57:38,458
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's probably a good compromise.

2319
02:57:40,664 --> 02:57:45,048
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a parent that would like to speak.

2320
02:57:45,068 --> 02:57:49,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Your name and address, please.

2321
02:57:49,452 --> 02:57:50,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, I'm Jenny Graham, 7 Ronalee Road.

2322
02:58:07,511 --> 02:58:10,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a couple of practical suggestions.

2323
02:58:10,693 --> 02:58:16,858
[SPEAKER_21]: Has Nick Tucci been to any of these elementary schools to talk to the kids and establish any kind of a relationship?

2324
02:58:19,940 --> 02:58:23,182
[SPEAKER_19]: Has Mr. Tucci gone to any of the elementary schools?

2325
02:58:23,302 --> 02:58:26,744
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know Beverly and I spoke about that as well.

2326
02:58:28,325 --> 02:58:35,190
[SPEAKER_21]: So if what we're trying to do is change hearts and minds, you don't do that with vague letters.

2327
02:58:35,770 --> 02:58:36,471
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know that

2328
02:58:37,282 --> 02:58:40,883
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to do some level of kind of standardized communication.

2329
02:58:41,563 --> 02:58:48,225
[SPEAKER_21]: But to date, the letters have all been fairly vague and not descriptive.

2330
02:58:48,265 --> 02:58:49,726
[SPEAKER_21]: And I totally understand why.

2331
02:58:50,386 --> 02:59:04,430
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you want people to feel good about going to a school with a newly appointed principal who wasn't in the mix when people made their original selection and when that note went home, he could be really valuable in the discussion.

2332
02:59:05,628 --> 02:59:16,831
[SPEAKER_21]: I would definitely suggest that he's potentially someone who should be out in front of this and not waiting for parents to be upset and disappointed.

2333
02:59:17,371 --> 02:59:28,434
[SPEAKER_21]: Because if he's as fabulous as everyone says he is, and a former baseball player and an athlete and all of these great things, he should have some credibility.

2334
02:59:29,154 --> 02:59:33,155
[SPEAKER_21]: All he may need to do is put his face out there

2335
02:59:33,749 --> 02:59:35,211
[SPEAKER_21]: in particular populations.

2336
02:59:35,231 --> 02:59:38,475
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm a Brooks parent and I'm not somebody affected by this right now.

2337
02:59:39,176 --> 02:59:47,066
[SPEAKER_21]: But I would also say, if you're going to run a lottery and you're going to pull 17 students, 20 students, however many students from a particular school,

2338
02:59:48,096 --> 02:59:53,098
[SPEAKER_21]: I would go ahead and send that information home and say, this is your last chance, folks.

2339
02:59:53,578 --> 02:59:58,320
[SPEAKER_21]: You got 17, we are gonna pull 17 folks, 15, I don't care how many it is.

2340
02:59:58,420 --> 03:00:03,663
[SPEAKER_21]: But you have one more chance and then we're gonna do this and it's gonna be completely random.

2341
03:00:03,723 --> 03:00:10,645
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think you have to be transparent about the plan and what those consequences are.

2342
03:00:12,683 --> 03:00:18,328
[SPEAKER_26]: to go this route, but if you'd like to make one final, you know, cohort and submit it, we'll obviously take that through the end of the week.

2343
03:00:18,368 --> 03:00:20,330
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's it.

2344
03:00:20,390 --> 03:00:27,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think, you know, as a parent, hearing partial lottery, it's never been clear what that means.

2345
03:00:27,896 --> 03:00:31,519
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's because you guys aren't even clear exactly what that means even tonight.

2346
03:00:31,579 --> 03:00:33,060
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that's why you're talking about it.

2347
03:00:33,220 --> 03:00:38,265
[SPEAKER_21]: So when you hear that, you might take from that whatever it is that you want to take from it.

2348
03:00:38,425 --> 03:00:40,867
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you're intending to do something specific,

2349
03:00:41,789 --> 03:00:46,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Generally speaking, giving people those specific guidelines helps them make the best decision.

2350
03:00:46,531 --> 03:00:50,292
[SPEAKER_21]: And you may see people make a different choice.

2351
03:00:50,472 --> 03:00:58,515
[SPEAKER_21]: You may not, but if you don't do it, you are certain to have 17, 20, however many parents who are infuriated.

2352
03:00:59,435 --> 03:01:04,817
[SPEAKER_21]: So at least you have a chance to do something to lessen the impact of the people who are upset.

2353
03:01:05,417 --> 03:01:05,577
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

2354
03:01:05,637 --> 03:01:06,858
[SPEAKER_19]: Nelson, could you comment on

2355
03:01:07,698 --> 03:01:11,661
[SPEAKER_19]: Having Nick go to the fifth graders, we discussed this.

2356
03:01:11,981 --> 03:01:21,768
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that having Nick try to get around to the schools and have parent meetings is a little ambitious with his schedule and the time frame we're in.

2357
03:01:21,808 --> 03:01:22,369
[SPEAKER_15]: The Brooks School.

2358
03:01:22,809 --> 03:01:23,490
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, to the Brooks?

2359
03:01:23,510 --> 03:01:24,790
[SPEAKER_26]: The Brooks School.

2360
03:01:26,212 --> 03:01:29,894
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure how we would schedule an evening or when that would be.

2361
03:01:31,135 --> 03:01:32,356
[SPEAKER_26]: It's up to what you want to do.

2362
03:01:32,456 --> 03:01:35,038
[SPEAKER_26]: But again, we'd be further delayed.

2363
03:01:36,306 --> 03:01:42,468
[SPEAKER_26]: Whatever you want to do, though, is we'll ask Mr. Tucci if he wants to try to hold a parent meeting at the Brooks.

2364
03:01:43,989 --> 03:01:46,969
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know a schedule or if that's feasible.

2365
03:01:47,490 --> 03:01:49,190
[SPEAKER_26]: But again, we're getting into June.

2366
03:01:49,970 --> 03:01:51,571
[SPEAKER_26]: Principals cannot schedule buildings.

2367
03:01:51,611 --> 03:01:52,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Fingers are up.

2368
03:01:53,051 --> 03:01:53,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

2369
03:01:53,232 --> 03:01:53,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Van de Kloot.

2370
03:01:53,832 --> 03:01:58,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, the last time we discussed this, I had recommended that Mr. Tucci go to the schools.

2371
03:01:58,253 --> 03:01:59,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, he didn't have time.

2372
03:02:00,114 --> 03:02:02,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're zeroing in on one particular school.

2373
03:02:04,517 --> 03:02:17,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Setting up a parent meeting, I'm not sure, but how about first, I think we need to allow Mr. Tucci time to be down there at the beginning of school on a day or the end of where parents might be there.

2374
03:02:17,727 --> 03:02:28,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to send home a letter saying, giving them one last time, but saying Mr. Tucci's gonna be at the school at these times to give you a chance and he's going to be visiting the fifth grade classes.

2375
03:02:30,156 --> 03:02:31,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's how I'd go about it.

2376
03:02:33,127 --> 03:02:34,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think you set a date.

2377
03:02:34,408 --> 03:02:45,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you set the date for the randomization of numbers, as my colleague says, to be sometime next week.

2378
03:02:45,077 --> 03:02:46,278
[SPEAKER_02]: But you set that up this week.

2379
03:02:46,938 --> 03:02:48,279
[SPEAKER_02]: You said send a letter home.

2380
03:02:49,100 --> 03:02:56,706
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Mr. Tucci be at the school at times when parents can meet with him.

2381
03:02:56,826 --> 03:03:02,431
[SPEAKER_02]: You have him be out maybe at the playground or something with students, the fifth grade students, so he can get a chance to meet them.

2382
03:03:04,271 --> 03:03:20,477
[SPEAKER_02]: At the very least, it will at least give students familiarity with Mr. Tucci so that if they are the ones selected, they will at least have a face rather than just a name.

2383
03:03:21,097 --> 03:03:23,538
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that would be beneficial no matter what.

2384
03:03:24,018 --> 03:03:27,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand Mr. Tucci is just taking on a new position.

2385
03:03:28,680 --> 03:03:29,340
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just

2386
03:03:30,449 --> 03:03:34,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that we need to get other people to cover it for the time that he's at the Brooks.

2387
03:03:34,452 --> 03:03:45,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, you know, suggesting he spend the whole day there, but I'm suggesting he be there when parents might reasonably be there and visit the classrooms, the fifth grade classrooms.

2388
03:03:47,323 --> 03:03:58,632
[SPEAKER_26]: So the message to the parents would be that we are doing the partial lottery, but there's an opportunity to switch to the McGlynn.

2389
03:03:59,395 --> 03:04:03,396
[SPEAKER_26]: and Mr. Tucci would be meeting with them to answer any questions?

2390
03:04:03,976 --> 03:04:07,517
[SPEAKER_26]: Or do we wait and just, I don't know, whatever you want to do.

2391
03:04:07,537 --> 03:04:19,461
[SPEAKER_19]: Now that you would schedule a meeting for Mr. Tucci to meet with the fifth grade parents, schedule it by next Monday, so maybe Thursday night or next Monday night, possibly the PTO could host.

2392
03:04:20,041 --> 03:04:22,242
[SPEAKER_19]: That's their last opportunity to get to know him.

2393
03:04:22,442 --> 03:04:25,562
[SPEAKER_19]: Otherwise, there will be a lottery on X date, and we are taking 16,

2394
03:04:28,293 --> 03:04:29,774
[SPEAKER_19]: potential kids from the Brooks.

2395
03:04:34,216 --> 03:04:37,437
[SPEAKER_26]: But I'm hearing Paulette, you said you during the day to what evening?

2396
03:04:37,477 --> 03:04:41,719
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I think you need a night meeting when parents can... To be honest with you, I would do both.

2397
03:04:41,839 --> 03:04:46,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have him there where he's around and either drop off or pick up.

2398
03:04:46,682 --> 03:04:47,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, certainly

2399
03:04:47,635 --> 03:04:47,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

2400
03:04:47,815 --> 03:04:55,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Galluzzi can give you an idea of how many of the fifth graders' parents actually drop them off and if that is, whether there would be any to talk to.

2401
03:04:56,602 --> 03:05:01,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd certainly have him go into the fifth grade classes to introduce himself and let them.

2402
03:05:03,087 --> 03:05:06,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the kids might go home and say, hey, I met the new principal.

2403
03:05:06,130 --> 03:05:10,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, and then we make it clear that it's going to happen.

2404
03:05:10,854 --> 03:05:12,575
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least we've given it another shot.

2405
03:05:12,595 --> 03:05:14,537
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

2406
03:05:15,037 --> 03:05:16,058
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, Mr. Russo.

2407
03:05:16,959 --> 03:05:17,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Lastly.

2408
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:24,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure we're just focusing on the Brooks, not just because Mr. Tucci can only be in so many places at once.

2409
03:05:25,845 --> 03:05:30,367
[SPEAKER_19]: For parity, to get into the 20 percentile of participation.

2410
03:05:30,387 --> 03:05:31,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, yes.

2411
03:05:31,308 --> 03:05:32,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2412
03:05:32,569 --> 03:05:32,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm done.

2413
03:05:32,789 --> 03:05:32,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2414
03:05:32,889 --> 03:05:33,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Regiro.

2415
03:05:33,509 --> 03:05:36,511
[SPEAKER_11]: One last point in support of this idea of Mr. Tucci going down.

2416
03:05:36,531 --> 03:05:39,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important for the community that

2417
03:05:41,262 --> 03:05:44,924
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want kids to just be forced at the last minute with no recall.

2418
03:05:44,964 --> 03:05:48,486
[SPEAKER_11]: We want parents to have as many options as they can and many possibilities.

2419
03:05:48,946 --> 03:05:55,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we can get 10 people to move over, that's only five that we have to select from the rest of the cohort.

2420
03:05:55,990 --> 03:05:58,031
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really do support this idea.

2421
03:05:58,051 --> 03:06:05,735
[SPEAKER_11]: I think either we're paying now or we're paying later, because there's going to be feelings about this, especially when we're taking such a large percentage.

2422
03:06:05,975 --> 03:06:08,897
[SPEAKER_26]: I just want to get the communication clear to parents.

2423
03:06:09,323 --> 03:06:29,707
[SPEAKER_26]: because we can do all of the Mr. Tucci meeting with parents and all that, but the letter would go out to parents saying that we are gonna do the lottery, however, I'm sorry?

2424
03:06:34,948 --> 03:06:37,188
[SPEAKER_26]: So on Wednesday, there'd be the partial lottery.

2425
03:06:37,868 --> 03:06:42,689
[SPEAKER_13]: No one came forward by Tuesday.

2426
03:06:45,630 --> 03:06:49,351
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I will get to this tomorrow and Diane and I will draft a letter.

2427
03:06:49,391 --> 03:06:49,931
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion.

2428
03:06:59,350 --> 03:07:01,472
[SPEAKER_19]: on the motion that those steps be followed.

2429
03:07:02,233 --> 03:07:03,094
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

2430
03:07:03,114 --> 03:07:03,454
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

2431
03:07:03,894 --> 03:07:04,775
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

2432
03:07:05,216 --> 03:07:05,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion is granted.

2433
03:07:06,597 --> 03:07:19,910
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to comment also that when we announced Mr. Tucci at the McGlynn School, it might have been one of the most fabulous days that I have had in a school setting.

2434
03:07:20,455 --> 03:07:23,576
[SPEAKER_19]: both the students, teachers made signs for him.

2435
03:07:24,036 --> 03:07:26,417
[SPEAKER_19]: The students were elated, cheering.

2436
03:07:26,457 --> 03:07:32,940
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like a pep rally for Thanksgiving game back in the day when Medford High was like, you know, first in the JBL.

2437
03:07:33,460 --> 03:07:34,361
[SPEAKER_19]: It was phenomenal.

2438
03:07:34,601 --> 03:07:38,342
[SPEAKER_19]: And it just showed how the community has come together.

2439
03:07:38,422 --> 03:07:43,745
[SPEAKER_19]: So I hope that people have seen some of the video from that day because it was really, really amazing.

2440
03:07:44,385 --> 03:07:47,226
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm just really proud of that school for standing tall, so.

2441
03:07:48,647 --> 03:07:48,987
[SPEAKER_19]: All righty.

2442
03:07:50,212 --> 03:07:54,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Next order of business, under new, sure collaborative quarterly report.

2443
03:07:54,933 --> 03:07:57,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a motion to receive and place this on file by Mr. Russo?

2444
03:07:58,654 --> 03:07:59,274
[SPEAKER_19]: So moved.

2445
03:07:59,734 --> 03:08:00,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a second by Ms.

2446
03:08:00,794 --> 03:08:01,354
[SPEAKER_19]: Mostone?

2447
03:08:01,474 --> 03:08:02,234
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

2448
03:08:02,995 --> 03:08:03,775
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

2449
03:08:03,875 --> 03:08:04,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion carries.

2450
03:08:08,156 --> 03:08:12,317
[SPEAKER_19]: Discussion of application of open meeting law to electronic devices.

2451
03:08:12,457 --> 03:08:13,357
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Russo.

2452
03:08:15,657 --> 03:08:16,037
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

2453
03:08:16,057 --> 03:08:18,978
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2454
03:08:20,935 --> 03:08:27,537
[SPEAKER_10]: When somebody in the public comes to speak, they come to the podium, and they state their name and their address.

2455
03:08:27,717 --> 03:08:35,279
[SPEAKER_10]: And everybody in the room, everybody in the audience, everybody on TV knows who is asking questions or saying what they have to say.

2456
03:08:35,299 --> 03:08:49,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know from my own experience sitting here that I have sort of been receiving messages to try and what I see as you assert the point of open meetings, and that is,

2457
03:08:50,725 --> 03:08:52,946
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, texting, hey, Paul, ask this question.

2458
03:08:52,986 --> 03:08:53,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Paul, do this.

2459
03:08:54,226 --> 03:09:16,793
[SPEAKER_10]: And, well, I don't wear an earpiece and I'm not, you know, I was supposed to say the president, but, and I think it's really important that the people that are here that have taken the time to come here and ask questions are the people who are asking the questions and that we are not just mouthpieces for any number of people who could be sitting at home texting us.

2460
03:09:18,280 --> 03:09:26,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I also want to point out that the Attorney General's website makes it clear that the open meeting law does not specifically address this issue.

2461
03:09:26,984 --> 03:09:31,226
[SPEAKER_10]: The Attorney General does say it is not recommended that we do this.

2462
03:09:32,747 --> 03:09:40,511
[SPEAKER_10]: That includes texting each other across the room, although, frankly, the only time I've been involved in those kinds of texts are, oh, my God, could it be any hotter in here?

2463
03:09:41,171 --> 03:09:43,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, you know, are we going drinking afterwards?

2464
03:09:45,764 --> 03:09:50,426
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it was you, of course it was you.

2465
03:09:50,946 --> 03:10:05,391
[SPEAKER_10]: But for matters that are actually before us, I just feel that it's important that at least I make the stand that I will not be having private deliberations or communications with the public during or with other members.

2466
03:10:05,411 --> 03:10:10,973
[SPEAKER_19]: Make it a school committee rule that phones should be turned off.

2467
03:10:11,133 --> 03:10:11,773
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's,

2468
03:10:15,330 --> 03:10:18,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's unfortunate if we aren't all on board with this.

2469
03:10:20,814 --> 03:10:33,925
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, obviously this isn't enforceable, but this is just something that I have seen and I have received messages from the public, you know, to ask questions of the people at the podium or to ask questions of other members or whatever.

2470
03:10:34,045 --> 03:10:36,246
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just don't find that to be above board.

2471
03:10:36,266 --> 03:10:40,350
[SPEAKER_10]: It clearly is not officially illegal, but I just wanted to bring that up.

2472
03:10:41,170 --> 03:10:44,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Make it in a motion for school committee rule to be adopted.

2473
03:10:46,529 --> 03:10:48,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any other discussion before I make that motion?

2474
03:10:48,370 --> 03:10:49,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, well, make the motion.

2475
03:10:49,531 --> 03:10:57,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to make a motion that a school committee rule is that we do not have private deliberations with anyone during open session.

2476
03:10:59,316 --> 03:10:59,376
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

2477
03:10:59,416 --> 03:10:59,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

2478
03:10:59,536 --> 03:11:00,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Vander Kloof up next.

2479
03:11:00,937 --> 03:11:15,725
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I'd like to clarify is that the only message that I've received along the lines of what you're talking was, in fact, at a recent meeting when the person texted me to let me know

2480
03:11:16,255 --> 03:11:19,576
[SPEAKER_02]: that we were not, the sound was not on.

2481
03:11:20,917 --> 03:11:23,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was actually very helpful for us to know.

2482
03:11:23,818 --> 03:11:32,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, I mean that wasn't a question, that was just a point of information which was useful for us to know so that we were responsive.

2483
03:11:33,481 --> 03:11:42,064
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just need to be clear that that is a decidedly different type of message than someone asking you something.

2484
03:11:45,218 --> 03:11:54,942
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other way to do it is if someone were to, and I'm just throwing this out, is to announce this question comes from.

2485
03:11:55,883 --> 03:11:59,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wondered, I sort of wondered, Paul, what your reaction to that is.

2486
03:12:00,825 --> 03:12:01,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Russo.

2487
03:12:02,086 --> 03:12:03,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, thank you.

2488
03:12:03,046 --> 03:12:11,750
[SPEAKER_10]: So actually, I did put that in my email that I sent to Mayor Burke and Mr. Belson, saying that that was something that I had considered as an alternative.

2489
03:12:13,928 --> 03:12:19,109
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do question whether or not the, well, first of all, who's going to text us?

2490
03:12:19,189 --> 03:12:28,552
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we have to say, well, from the public, so-and-so who lives at, which, I mean, I don't get text messages that give me their address, but would like to know this question.

2491
03:12:28,912 --> 03:12:32,373
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, I guess that wouldn't really bother me.

2492
03:12:32,833 --> 03:12:42,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just like to amend whatever it is I said before to say that within private communications that are within our authority, if I get a text that, you know,

2493
03:12:44,008 --> 03:12:51,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think anybody has an issue with that.

2494
03:12:51,771 --> 03:12:54,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And I suppose that does mean that, you know, doing the drinking.

2495
03:12:54,512 --> 03:13:08,938
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can clarify it by simply saying the only electronic communications allowable will be those for emergencies or for personal in nature, but not anything that impacts the discussion on the floor.

2496
03:13:08,998 --> 03:13:09,719
[SPEAKER_19]: School committee business.

2497
03:13:09,739 --> 03:13:10,559
[SPEAKER_01]: School committee business.

2498
03:13:11,219 --> 03:13:12,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way you, you know,

2499
03:13:13,223 --> 03:13:15,343
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you cover it, because obviously it's an emergency.

2500
03:13:15,363 --> 03:13:16,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's happening at home.

2501
03:13:16,624 --> 03:13:17,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's happening in your life.

2502
03:13:17,684 --> 03:13:18,584
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get that.

2503
03:13:19,544 --> 03:13:21,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the emergency cover the sound off?

2504
03:13:22,245 --> 03:13:22,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover what?

2505
03:13:23,265 --> 03:13:25,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the emergency cover that the sound is off?

2506
03:13:26,645 --> 03:13:26,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2507
03:13:26,925 --> 03:13:32,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I think that would be for, you know, affects the general operation of the meeting.

2508
03:13:32,766 --> 03:13:33,406
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not our business.

2509
03:13:33,767 --> 03:13:34,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Not our business.

2510
03:13:34,707 --> 03:13:35,087
[SPEAKER_19]: Our docket.

2511
03:13:35,287 --> 03:13:35,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2512
03:13:35,487 --> 03:13:42,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you wouldn't want the difference between someone telling you how to vote on a particular topic versus someone telling you that

2513
03:13:42,491 --> 03:13:43,652
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't hear what you're saying.

2514
03:13:43,812 --> 03:13:44,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

2515
03:13:44,472 --> 03:13:49,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's, I certainly support Mr. Rousseau's motion.

2516
03:13:50,516 --> 03:13:51,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make the clarification.

2517
03:13:52,037 --> 03:13:52,998
[SPEAKER_19]: Second on the motion?

2518
03:13:53,278 --> 03:13:53,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2519
03:13:54,319 --> 03:13:55,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Ruggiero.

2520
03:13:55,640 --> 03:13:56,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2521
03:13:57,041 --> 03:13:58,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Overall, I definitely support the spirit.

2522
03:13:58,622 --> 03:14:00,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I leave my cell phone in the car for this very reason.

2523
03:14:01,003 --> 03:14:04,386
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I have my computer here, but I'm not receiving texts to it.

2524
03:14:05,066 --> 03:14:07,728
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's important for us to recognize as a group

2525
03:14:08,225 --> 03:14:12,646
[SPEAKER_11]: that we live in an age where people that do have serious disabilities can still participate.

2526
03:14:13,747 --> 03:14:16,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And it would be great if we create an environment for that to happen.

2527
03:14:17,468 --> 03:14:29,851
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree that we should have all of our personal, like, you know, someone shouldn't be sending member Ruggiero a message or member Paul a message, because that's kind of, it's kind of working beyond the spirit of open meeting.

2528
03:14:30,331 --> 03:14:37,213
[SPEAKER_11]: But it would be nice if we had a number or a Twitter feed or something where maybe the chair could make,

2529
03:14:37,844 --> 03:14:43,249
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Martin, who has a serious disability, wasn't able to come today.

2530
03:14:43,930 --> 03:14:46,292
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but he had a really great suggestion.

2531
03:14:46,653 --> 03:14:47,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Martin lives on this address.

2532
03:14:48,114 --> 03:14:50,356
[SPEAKER_11]: He wishes me to bring this point up.

2533
03:14:51,077 --> 03:14:56,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I really would feel, I think, you know, we live in a time where we can make that possible.

2534
03:14:57,003 --> 03:15:00,687
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would like to suggest, once again, a friendly amendment that we, for now,

2535
03:15:01,334 --> 03:15:03,735
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we can all agree that this is probably for the best.

2536
03:15:03,836 --> 03:15:05,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I leave my cell phone because I get texts during meetings.

2537
03:15:05,857 --> 03:15:07,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't prefer, I don't like it either.

2538
03:15:07,478 --> 03:15:12,461
[SPEAKER_11]: I get the same kind of, and I don't want to, you know, I don't think it's fair for me to like, hey Mia, do you really want to do this?

2539
03:15:12,481 --> 03:15:12,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go.

2540
03:15:12,861 --> 03:15:15,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's, that's also seems to be subverting the spirit.

2541
03:15:16,363 --> 03:15:23,087
[SPEAKER_11]: But on the same token, I think it's important for us to pursue avenues that people that do have serious issues that they can't come to meetings.

2542
03:15:23,535 --> 03:15:25,576
[SPEAKER_11]: can also have a means of communicating with us.

2543
03:15:25,596 --> 03:15:33,577
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to look that we think about ways to make that possible in the future, if I can make a friendly amendment for us to sort of figure out the wording together now.

2544
03:15:35,038 --> 03:15:42,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, one of the things you do have, people can under community participation provide me with a document that they want me to introduce.

2545
03:15:42,660 --> 03:15:45,720
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to necessarily present it, but I can distribute it.

2546
03:15:46,701 --> 03:15:52,042
[SPEAKER_01]: So another way to say if you have a document or some position paper you want the committee to take under consideration,

2547
03:15:52,780 --> 03:15:55,761
[SPEAKER_01]: You send it to the office by such and such, and we'll distribute it for you.

2548
03:15:56,481 --> 03:15:58,181
[SPEAKER_19]: And our agenda is very thorough.

2549
03:15:58,241 --> 03:16:02,562
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't do much under suspension like other bodies may do.

2550
03:16:03,122 --> 03:16:06,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Ours are written out and pretty clear on what we're talking about.

2551
03:16:06,043 --> 03:16:06,903
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not vague.

2552
03:16:07,163 --> 03:16:12,965
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think someone could submit comments if they see it on Friday for the meeting on Monday.

2553
03:16:15,045 --> 03:16:17,146
[SPEAKER_19]: We have Mr. Russo.

2554
03:16:17,566 --> 03:16:18,606
[SPEAKER_19]: No, you already spoke.

2555
03:16:18,986 --> 03:16:20,027
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Benedetto, sorry.

2556
03:16:20,187 --> 03:16:20,867
[SPEAKER_19]: You can go up next.

2557
03:16:21,227 --> 03:16:21,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2558
03:16:22,415 --> 03:16:36,338
[SPEAKER_18]: My only concern with this is a lot of our population could be single parents that might want something brought forward, and they can't leave their children unattended to attend these meetings, but they could be watching it at home.

2559
03:16:36,899 --> 03:16:43,080
[SPEAKER_18]: So I agree that less use is best, less is best in this forum.

2560
03:16:44,400 --> 03:16:50,342
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I do agree that announcing who it was, if it's commented on or looked at,

2561
03:16:50,779 --> 03:16:56,261
[SPEAKER_18]: throughout the meeting and not later, then I do agree that that should be announced.

2562
03:16:56,742 --> 03:17:06,666
[SPEAKER_18]: But there are people that don't have the ability to leave their home at seven o'clock at nighttime because they're not able, and they're not gonna bring their children out at that time.

2563
03:17:07,146 --> 03:17:12,768
[SPEAKER_18]: So that would be a concern to me, that people wanted to speak about an item and we're not reaching them.

2564
03:17:14,009 --> 03:17:15,249
[SPEAKER_18]: That's my only concern.

2565
03:17:17,606 --> 03:17:23,990
[SPEAKER_13]: I hear you, but I think we get emails often from parents that you've referenced tonight, the after school.

2566
03:17:24,110 --> 03:17:36,638
[SPEAKER_13]: So I almost feel like Paul's taking the weight off my own shoulders by saying it's not something we want to do because I do get texts regularly from friends who are also parents in the school system.

2567
03:17:36,918 --> 03:17:45,844
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we've gotten a number of emails that all of us have shared here that if parents have a concern or a resident, we can bring it and say, we got this email from this person.

2568
03:17:45,964 --> 03:17:46,905
[SPEAKER_13]: So I second.

2569
03:17:47,485 --> 03:17:49,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Paul's motion.

2570
03:17:51,108 --> 03:17:51,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry, Paulette.

2571
03:17:51,868 --> 03:17:52,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I third Paul's motion.

2572
03:17:52,809 --> 03:17:53,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, she thirds it.

2573
03:17:54,690 --> 03:17:57,392
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion offered by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

2574
03:17:57,432 --> 03:18:12,623
[SPEAKER_19]: Van de Kloot and Mustone, that the use of personal devices be restricted to only items that are personal in nature, not from the public regarding school committee business.

2575
03:18:22,481 --> 03:18:26,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just say that, you know, we can all have our phones out.

2576
03:18:26,564 --> 03:18:31,067
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's, you know, I have Word on my phone and you can have your laptop open.

2577
03:18:31,107 --> 03:18:32,368
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a trust issue.

2578
03:18:32,548 --> 03:18:37,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not expecting you to, you know, wrap your device in some lead so it can't get the internet.

2579
03:18:38,872 --> 03:18:39,993
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, so.

2580
03:18:48,831 --> 03:18:49,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2581
03:18:50,132 --> 03:18:50,312
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2582
03:18:50,332 --> 03:18:52,273
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2583
03:18:52,933 --> 03:18:54,794
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2584
03:18:56,035 --> 03:18:56,455
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

2585
03:18:56,915 --> 03:18:57,255
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2586
03:18:57,395 --> 03:18:59,977
[SPEAKER_19]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, motion passes.

2587
03:18:59,997 --> 03:19:03,238
[SPEAKER_28]: I have to just ask a quick question.

2588
03:19:03,959 --> 03:19:15,845
[SPEAKER_28]: If there is a case where someone gets a message making that it is critical for us to hear, but they announce who it's from and what the message is,

2589
03:19:20,496 --> 03:19:23,577
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they can email us the next day, and we can bring it up at our next meeting.

2590
03:19:27,859 --> 03:19:28,620
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not honest.

2591
03:19:28,680 --> 03:19:29,800
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't feel honest to me.

2592
03:19:30,121 --> 03:19:32,462
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am totally guilty of it.

2593
03:19:32,502 --> 03:19:36,144
[SPEAKER_13]: For the past two years, people have texted me, and I've brought up issues that people have texted me.

2594
03:19:36,604 --> 03:19:37,424
[SPEAKER_13]: And it felt yucky.

2595
03:19:38,085 --> 03:19:40,686
[SPEAKER_13]: And I never even thought of going this route with Paul.

2596
03:19:40,746 --> 03:19:42,647
[SPEAKER_13]: I respect him for addressing this.

2597
03:19:46,757 --> 03:19:50,178
[SPEAKER_19]: On the next item, discussion of pending legislation on recess.

2598
03:19:50,298 --> 03:19:51,199
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Rousseau.

2599
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:56,240
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, sorry.

2600
03:19:57,221 --> 03:19:58,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, hello again.

2601
03:19:58,801 --> 03:20:01,102
[SPEAKER_10]: So, do I have to read the front page?

2602
03:20:01,342 --> 03:20:01,562
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2603
03:20:01,682 --> 03:20:02,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, good.

2604
03:20:02,703 --> 03:20:14,047
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there are two, there's a Senate bill and a House bill currently in the State House, State Legislature for, related to a lot of things,

2605
03:20:14,710 --> 03:20:18,812
[SPEAKER_10]: It's primarily recess, and I won't read the entire.

2606
03:20:19,112 --> 03:20:19,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2607
03:20:19,992 --> 03:20:22,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Waive the reading of the entire proclamation here.

2608
03:20:22,574 --> 03:20:23,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's quite long.

2609
03:20:24,134 --> 03:20:30,878
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to thank the Somerville School Committee for having written this, that I've gotten their permission to just steal it.

2610
03:20:30,898 --> 03:20:31,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, that's pretty common.

2611
03:20:33,459 --> 03:20:41,402
[SPEAKER_10]: But the gist of these two bills is that unstructured recess becomes time on learning.

2612
03:20:42,907 --> 03:20:47,730
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the issues we have is, as a committee, we could simply say recess is gonna be 45 minutes every day.

2613
03:20:48,210 --> 03:20:55,855
[SPEAKER_10]: But then there isn't enough time on learning unless we then go to contract negotiations and extend the day and pay the teachers more and on and on.

2614
03:20:56,376 --> 03:21:03,120
[SPEAKER_10]: So this really changes the nature of recess in that it is, it must be unstructured recess.

2615
03:21:03,220 --> 03:21:05,282
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not gym, not phys ed.

2616
03:21:06,182 --> 03:21:10,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And it counts as time on learning, which alleviates the issue of

2617
03:21:11,079 --> 03:21:15,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we still have plenty of other issues around scheduling it, but if we decided to increase it.

2618
03:21:15,560 --> 03:21:16,660
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 20 minutes a day.

2619
03:21:16,680 --> 03:21:26,363
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 20 minutes a day, and it cannot be, and the recess cannot be denied for disciplinary reasons.

2620
03:21:28,763 --> 03:21:29,123
[SPEAKER_19]: Very good.

2621
03:21:29,143 --> 03:21:29,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Any questions?

2622
03:21:31,084 --> 03:21:31,464
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.

2623
03:21:31,704 --> 03:21:32,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion for approval.

2624
03:21:32,764 --> 03:21:33,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Moved by Ms.

2625
03:21:33,664 --> 03:21:35,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Vandekloot, seconded by Mr. Russo.

2626
03:21:37,530 --> 03:21:38,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

2627
03:21:41,513 --> 03:21:42,173
