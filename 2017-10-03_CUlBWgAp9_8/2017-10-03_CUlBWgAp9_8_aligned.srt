1
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:06,703
and justice for all.

2
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:13,949
If we could remain standing to have a moment of silence for the victims of the Las Vegas massacre.

3
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:19,994
Thank you.

4
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:27,461
I'd like to remind everybody that October is Breast Cancer Month.

5
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,903
If you could wear pink.

6
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:32,079
At the meetings, it would be appreciated.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,742
My mother had breast cancer on three different occasions.

8
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:42,186
And I think as everybody knows, it's a very serious disease and it affects many women in this country.

9
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:43,547
All right.

10
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,409
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,091
1766, offered by Councilor Knight.

12
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:56,637
It resolved that the city engineer require the damage in front of the residence located at 31 Wildwood Road be repaired.

13
00:00:57,497 --> 00:01:04,519
This damage as a result of prior contractors using this public way as a staging area from Wytham Street drained this project.

14
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,199
Counselor Knight.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,860
Mr. President, thank you very much.

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:15,703
Over the weekend I was out knocking on doors talking to some of my neighbors and one of the concerns that was raised was the fact that the roadway and the small patch of grass in front of 31

17
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:24,410
Wildwood Road has been damaged, and it's been damaged for quite some time after the Winthrop Street draining project was conducted, Mr. President.

18
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,911
They used that location as a staging area for some of their supplies, equipment, pipes, and the like.

19
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:31,472
And what's happened is the roadway has begun to sink in.

20
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:34,433
The grass patch has also sunken in.

21
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:36,694
So it's creating an issue where there's a lot of puddling and pooling.

22
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:46,177
You can also see that there's a temporary trench that was made right there at the location, Mr. President, and that has also settled to the point where it's creating an ice hazard come the cold weather.

23
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:56,928
I'm asking my council colleagues to support this resolution and request that the city engineer contact the private contractor that was hired to perform the Winthrop Street Janning project and get out there and fix this problem.

24
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:02,393
As we know, we issued a special permit, and the special permit requires that all our streets be restored to pristine condition.

25
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:07,278
Mr. President, that wasn't the case in this construction project, so I'm asking that this contract to be held accountable.

26
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,339
Thank you.

27
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:08,920
Seconded.

28
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:13,940
On the motion by Councilor Knight seconded by Councilor Langel-Kern.

29
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:14,581
All those in favor?

30
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:15,002
Aye.

31
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:17,165
Motion passes.

32
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:18,727
17-767 offered by Councilor Knight.

33
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:27,298
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council requests the Zoning Board of Appeals convene for the purpose of placing restrictions on pre-existing

34
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:34,149
non-conforming use variance issued to the property located at 186 Winthrop Street.

35
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:34,770
Counselor Knight.

36
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,352
Mr. President, thank you very much.

37
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:41,020
The property located at 186 Winthrop Street is one that's been familiar to this council in the past.

38
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,083
I've raised issues concerning its operations.

39
00:02:43,636 --> 00:03:04,325
uh... ultimately this is a business that's on the corner of west street in winthrop street and what's happened is uh... they've continuously exceeded operating hours uh... in the month of may alone i've counted fifteen violations that i first personally reported uh... we're also seeing a large number of trucks using west street a residential street for trucking purposes the emphasis the emphasis purposes while uh... they cook their

40
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:07,048
muffins and bagels at Stone and Skillet.

41
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:11,691
They're leaving the trucks idling on West Street, bringing them around the block, loading the trucks up.

42
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:13,992
And while they're loading the trucks up, they're blocking the public way.

43
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:16,073
Winter Street, they're blocking the public way, West Street.

44
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,714
The neighbors have reached a point of frustration.

45
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:20,195
The property's in disrepair.

46
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:22,516
It's shabbily maintained.

47
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,317
The sidewalk's covered in grease.

48
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:28,880
The back of the facility looks like an abomination, Mr. President.

49
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:37,005
So I'm asking the Zoning Board of Appeals to convene for the purpose of placing restrictions on this pre-existing non-conforming use variance that was issued to the property, Mr. President.

50
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:39,047
I'm asking my council colleagues to support this.

51
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:43,290
The way that this would work is we'd make this recommendation and it would go to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

52
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,953
The Zoning Board of Appeals would then take the matter up on their agenda, provide notification to the abutters,

53
00:03:48,750 --> 00:04:01,203
in the property owner, everyone gets in the same room, they can have an opportunity to explain and express some of the concerns that they have and some of the issues that they'd have to deal with, and then the Zoning Board of Appeals can make the appropriate determination because this is something that's under their purview.

54
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:03,205
On the motion by Councillor Knight.

55
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:05,227
Councilor Del Rosso.

56
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:07,508
Mr. President, I just want to comment on this matter.

57
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:11,930
The council has spoken on this issue a couple times.

58
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:17,713
We're aware that this was brought to the Board of Health and Inspectional Services for action.

59
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:31,699
I just feel it's quite unfortunate that the business proprietor who rents that spot has obviously chosen not to be a good neighbor and isn't engaged in business practices.

60
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:43,746
that are conducive to being in a neighborhood and having the pre-existing non-conforming use variances that it's had.

61
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,848
And it's unfortunate that it's come to this.

62
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:49,450
I support this motion and second approval.

63
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,091
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRosso.

64
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:53,511
Councilor Knight.

65
00:04:53,731 --> 00:05:00,274
I'd also like to point out, Mr. President, that because this establishment's a bakery wholesaler, state law governs the oversight.

66
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,795
And our local board of health has no local control.

67
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:08,637
So that's creating a significant problem in our ability to enforce what's going on down there.

68
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:11,618
Also, this non-conforming use variance has been issued.

69
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,419
It's been in place since when Marty's for Parties was there with Marty Murphy Sr.

70
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,163
ran the business, so it's a non-conforming use variance that's been in place.

71
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:22,906
I think it was even initiated before the Zoning Act, Mr. President.

72
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:26,209
So with that being said, I think that the neighborhood has had enough.

73
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,431
They need relief, and I'm asking my council colleagues to support this.

74
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:33,374
On the motion by Councilor Nights, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

75
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,114
All those in favor?

76
00:05:34,254 --> 00:05:34,374
Aye.

77
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:36,835
Motion passes.

78
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:53,882
17668, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the code enforcement officer investigate the operations of Jack's Gas Station on Main Street, including but not limited to the parking and storage of maintenance of vehicles under their care being performed on Palmer Street.

79
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:54,962
Councilor Knight.

80
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:56,743
Mr. President, thank you very much.

81
00:05:56,763 --> 00:06:03,065
I've been contacted by a number of residents on Thomas Street concerning the operations of Jack's Gas Station.

82
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:15,549
Aside from the fact that there are concerns about the hours of operation opening a little bit sooner than the city would permit and staying open a little bit later than the city would permit, there's also a lot of work that's being done on our public way.

83
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:19,470
They're staging vehicles on our public way, and they're performing repair work on vehicles on our public way.

84
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,151
So we have a small residential street.

85
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:22,851
It's Thomas Street.

86
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:39,386
We have a business at the top of the street that has four to five employees that are all parking their vehicles on the street, and now we're having customers that are bringing their cars into this gas station, this service station for service, and they have no place to put these cars, so they're taking those cars and also putting them on Thomas Street, taking up a number of the residential parking spots that are on the street, Mr. President.

87
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:50,352
So I'm asking the code enforcement officer to go down there and investigate the situation to see if we can come up with some sort of mutual agreement and some sort of enforcement in continuity with operations down there, Mr. President.

88
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:51,573
This is a residential neighborhood,

89
00:06:52,453 --> 00:07:08,805
The gas station has been there for a very long time and under previous ownerships it was able to operate in concert with the neighborhood in good standing and I don't see why that cannot continue provided that we can bring them together and the parties together and talk about what's going on and the impact that it's having on the quality of life of those residents.

90
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:22,400
Also, if I could amend this to ask that the code enforcement officer also investigate their other operation across from the police station for the used car business that they're running there.

91
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:29,262
They have a license, but they're parking on, they have over the amount of cars I think are allowed, and they're parking on the state property.

92
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:34,143
And if we could amend that to put that in there also.

93
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:36,064
I certainly have no objection to that, Councillor.

94
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:41,629
I think that anything that we can do to protect the quality of life of the residents in that neighborhood is something that's beneficial to all.

95
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,312
So with that being said, I move approval on the question and ask for a second.

96
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:48,295
On the motion by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Falco.

97
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:48,935
All those in favour?

98
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:49,356
Aye.

99
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:52,078
Motion passes.

100
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:57,102
17669, offered by Councillor Knight, be it resolved that the Method DPW remove the following stumps.

101
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:00,665
75 Suffolk Street and 15 and Benham Street.

102
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:01,266
Councilor Knight.

103
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:07,631
Mr. President, the tree stump at 75 Suffolk Street and I have a very long and colorful history.

104
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:11,214
I think when I was 11 years old, I crashed my bike on it and got stitches in my head.

105
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:17,660
And since that time, the sidewalk in front of the home at 75 Suffolk Street has been broken up from this.

106
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,055
tree and not my head.

107
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,917
The sidewalk's not broken because I fell down, but because I crashed into the tree.

108
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,179
But the sidewalk's all broken up.

109
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,660
The tree is gigantic, Mr. President.

110
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,882
It's been cut down, but the stump remains in that location for an extended period of time.

111
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:37,527
So I'm asking that the DPW go out there and take the appropriate steps to fix the sidewalk and to remove the stump.

112
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:49,940
Likewise, for the location at 15 Benham Street, Mr. President, although my relationship with that tree stump isn't as intimate as the one on Suffolk Street, it's the same circumstance, the same situation, same facts, and I'd ask that the DPW remove those following tree stumps.

113
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:51,006
That's a focal.

114
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:52,046
Thank you, Mr. President.

115
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:53,407
I support this resolution.

116
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:59,788
And if the councilor don't mind, I'd like to add a free stuff at 27 Saunders Street that has been there for a number of years.

117
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:04,829
And it hasn't been removed and it needs to be removed in the interest of public safety.

118
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:16,952
And while I'm at it, if we could also get a list from the DPW director updating us as to what stumps were removed this summer and what sidewalk panels were repaired.

119
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:18,592
We appropriated funding for that.

120
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:24,658
while back and it would be good to get an update as to see what kind of progress was made during this past summer.

121
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:32,143
On the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Falco.

122
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:33,264
All those in favor.

123
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:34,984
Vice President Mox.

124
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:36,364
Thank you, Mr. President.

125
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:38,525
And I thank Councilor Knight for putting this on.

126
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,806
I just want to take it one step further than Councilor Falco.

127
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:44,606
If we can get a complete listing of all the stumps.

128
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:49,668
We got one roughly, I think it was about a year and a half ago from Brian Kerins.

129
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:55,609
And what I'm looking for, Mr. President, is a list of the age of the stump.

130
00:09:56,069 --> 00:10:01,555
how long it's been there, and what is gonna be done to remove the stump.

131
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:08,722
So I'd like the address, the age of the stump, and when the city plans on removing the stump.

132
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:10,232
Thank you.

133
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:17,598
On the motion by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Falco and Vice-President Mox, all those in favor?

134
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:18,038
Aye.

135
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,839
Motion passes.

136
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:28,365
17-670 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the striping at the intersection of Woburn Street and Wildwood Road be repainted in the interest of public safety.

137
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:29,026
Councilor Knight.

138
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:30,947
Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

139
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:39,373
Woburn Street is a relatively busy street that's populated with a number of children, and what we're seeing is a lot of kids walking to school in that neighborhood, Mr. President.

140
00:10:40,013 --> 00:11:02,328
Street right up over Austin Street and right down to the Brooks School and the four-way stop sign at Wildwood and Woburn Street is operating but the actual striping on the street is not and in years past they've come out and they've restriped this area and when I was out knocking doors last weekend a number of residents expressed concern over the fact that it hasn't been done

141
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:10,054
And they've also noted that they've seen an increase in the number of cars that are actually running the stop sign now because these controls aren't in place, Mr. President.

142
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:14,156
So I'm asking that the DPW take the appropriate steps to rectify the situation for the neighborhood.

143
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:19,259
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Mox.

144
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:21,079
Thank you, Mr. President.

145
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,082
And again, I would ask, considering this

146
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:36,272
Not this particular petition, but this finds its way on our council agenda, I'd say probably two dozen times a year regarding unpainted crosswalks.

147
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:52,571
And I, as one member of the council, and this has been supported by the council on numerous occasions, proposed implementing thermoplastic crosswalks, Mr. President, that last up to five years, slip resistant, highly resistible.

148
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:56,835
State highway uses it on their state roads, Mr. President.

149
00:11:57,455 --> 00:12:06,962
And I don't know why we as a community are still using the old methods of paint, and then within six months, you can't see the crosswalk anymore.

150
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:19,431
And I realize it's a little more expensive, but I think if you do the math and figure it over a five-year period where you don't have to touch them again, it'll be cost-effective for us to move that way.

151
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,132
And I still can't fathom

152
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:27,216
the number of times that I've brought this issue up, Mr. President, why we don't move in that direction.

153
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:37,283
I still have yet to receive an answer from the past administration under McGlynn and the present administration under Burke why we can't move forward on thermoplastic, Mr. President.

154
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:52,574
So I would ask that this respectfully be amended, Mr. President, to get a response back from the administration on why the thermoplastic is not being used, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

155
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:58,057
I put on a resolution last week regarding other streets, Mr. President.

156
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:01,038
And I think if you go around, it's already October.

157
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:06,161
If you go around the city, I'd venture to say that probably a little less than half are painted.

158
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:07,642
And we're already in October.

159
00:13:08,977 --> 00:13:14,820
So I'm not sure, you know, when the ideal time is to paint, but it's certainly not in the winter months.

160
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:16,141
Thank you.

161
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:18,362
Thank you.

162
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,123
Thank you, President Carvalho.

163
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:23,085
I also want to second this paper and second the amendment.

164
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:30,229
I've been a counselor for many years, and Councilman Locke has brought up thermoplastic crosswalks for years.

165
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:33,071
And it's something that we do need to explore.

166
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:35,152
And we've begged the administration to look into it.

167
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:41,991
We do not have the Department of Public Works staff to paint the crosswalks in the spring in a timely manner.

168
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:44,858
We just don't have the staff to do it, and we don't have the staff

169
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:49,158
to repair the ones that are faded come September, October, November.

170
00:13:49,479 --> 00:14:02,730
So to have something that's permanent for five years, we can create a system where we're doing 20% of the streets on a yearly basis, and we'll be able to have all of the crosswalks painted all the time.

171
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,174
And I think that's what the residents deserve, and that's for public safety, in the best interest of public safety.

172
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:11,477
So I would move approval on that and beg for an answer at this point.

173
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:12,275
Thank you.

174
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:16,079
Name and address of the record, please.

175
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,020
Hi.

176
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:30,754
The crosswalks over on Salem Street were painted late and this is very interesting because this is a crosswalk that a resident of Otis Street asked and they made a crosswalk between Tony's Gas and the crossing at Otis Street so

177
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:37,401
I had many potholes on the street and I went to Brian Cairns and God bless him, three days later he fixed the potholes.

178
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:42,966
But they put the tar on top of the freshly painted crosswalk.

179
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:46,890
It had been painted maybe a month ago, a month before the tarring.

180
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,413
So now you have a situation where this administration

181
00:14:51,718 --> 00:15:06,811
paints the crosswalks late, and then after someone goes to the news media and to Brian Karen's, and I believe that's why it was helpful when I went to the news media, as a resident told me they went to the mayor in May at LaCasse's and the mayor said she couldn't do it on Garfield.

182
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,652
I later got them to do it.

183
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:13,246
You can now get this horrendous crosswalk that is like tarred and feathered.

184
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:14,726
It's black and white.

185
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:15,527
It's crazy.

186
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:17,167
And it's double work.

187
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,348
So Mr. Kearns told me he would then go and repaint it.

188
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:22,090
So now you have painting, tarring, and painting.

189
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,290
Mr. Councilor, Vice President Marks is right.

190
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,031
Councilor Lungo-Kern is right.

191
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,573
Thermal plastic would resolve the issue.

192
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:32,534
But they would have to put the roads in good condition.

193
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:33,935
That is a priority.

194
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:37,596
So I would ask that the councilors consider amending this

195
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:51,283
motion or resolution to have that the crosswalks, if they put thermal plastic or paint, that they also make sure that they are paved correctly because we'll have problems, sir, if they have uneven crosswalks.

196
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:52,805
Thank you.

197
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:53,225
Thank you.

198
00:15:54,645 --> 00:16:07,293
Mr. President, I would hope with any new construction that's going on in the community that thermoplastic would be the practice of this community.

199
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:13,296
However, if we wait to fix our streets, which we know we do roughly

200
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:20,104
20-odd streets every five years in this community, and they're not full streets.

201
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:27,753
So if we wait to fix our streets to a standard that we believe is acceptable, we'll never use thermoplastic.

202
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:31,197
So it's kind of the cat chasing its tail.

203
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:33,460
We're never going to get ahead of this, Mr. President.

204
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,565
You know, I'm very supportive of the Complete Streets project that's going on now.

205
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:51,217
It's discussing many issues I've spoken about on traffic calming initiatives over the past 10 years, bump-outs at raised crosswalks, and other initiatives to slow down traffic on our streets, Mr. President.

206
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:55,962
That's all fine and dandy, but we also have to meet the basic necessities

207
00:16:56,482 --> 00:17:02,027
which are painting our crosswalks, which are fixing potholes, which is fixing sidewalks.

208
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:12,858
When I talk to business owners and they say, well, you're going to get a bump out in West Method, they say, that's great, but what about the huge hole I have in the sidewalk in front of my business that people are tripping over every day?

209
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:21,103
So it's nice to do those additions, and I support, as I said, complete streets and the $400,000 we got from the state to work on that.

210
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:29,429
But we also have to look at our own infrastructure and start repairing what we currently have, Mr. President, which are basic necessities.

211
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:36,115
This is not a wish list, basic necessities to fix a pothole and paint our crosswalks.

212
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,895
That's a public safety issue, Mr. President.

213
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:51,719
I have an item on the agenda a little bit later on in the agenda that's gonna talk again about public safety issues, Mr. President, and what can result when the city does not act upon these particular important issues.

214
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:53,399
Thank you.

215
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,000
On the motion by Councilor Nice,

216
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:00,605
Seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

217
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:02,086
All those in favor?

218
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:02,806
Aye.

219
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:04,366
Motion as amended.

220
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:05,366
Motion passes.

221
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:14,328
Mr. Clark, if you could please mock Councilor Scott Pelley as being present.

222
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:25,330
17761 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Philip Bumpa McGonigal on his recent passing

223
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:35,853
Phillip was a Method High graduate of 1942, World War II veteran, retired Malden firefighter, and a caring father, grandfather, and family man.

224
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:36,974
Councilor Knight.

225
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:39,955
Mr. President, I think this resolution speaks for itself.

226
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:44,838
Mr. McGonigal recently passed away, and it's with deep condolences that I bring this matter before the city council.

227
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:52,863
I'm asking my colleagues to join me in offering our deepest and most sincere condolences to the family of Phillip Bumper McGonigal.

228
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:55,925
He's the father of MHS assistant baseball coach John McGonigal.

229
00:18:57,738 --> 00:19:00,040
John's the son-in-law of former town manager, John Gleoni.

230
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,862
So I'd like to ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.

231
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:05,204
The gentleman lived a strong and long and healthy life.

232
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:07,246
If we could have more, Councilor Knight, if we could read that also.

233
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:07,967
Absolutely.

234
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:15,545
Offered by President Caravello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Al Canava.

235
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:20,067
Mr. Canava served our country in World War II in the Navy on the USS Halligan.

236
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,269
His vessel was attacked and killing 162 crewmen.

237
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:28,691
He drifted in the public in the Pacific off the coast of Okinawa several days before he was rescued.

238
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:33,913
Mr. Canava was decorated by President Delano Roosevelt for his service.

239
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:39,516
Mr. Canava was also active in many local organizations and was the past president of the Memphis Corners.

240
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:42,598
Mr. Canava was also a member of our liquor commission for many years.

241
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:49,384
He was known as Crazy Legs Canava and was a star athlete at BC, and he also played with the Green Bay Packers.

242
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,646
The President and our community will be missed.

243
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:00,274
Thank you.

244
00:20:03,177 --> 00:20:05,138
Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take up paper 17673.

245
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,984
Motion by Councilor Knight to suspend the rules to take up paper 17673.

246
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:17,165
Seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

247
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:17,845
All those in favor?

248
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:21,147
Motion passes.

249
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:25,770
17673, dear President Cabrera and members of the Memphis City Council.

250
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:34,816
This past April, the council approved food trucks at 10 various events that have or will be held in the city of Medford.

251
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:41,959
In fact, nine of these events have already been held, and there is one scheduled for October at Harvest Energy Festival.

252
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:50,122
I respectfully request that the council endorse similar food trucks for the Fells 5K that will be held on November 5th, 2017.

253
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:51,403
Thank you.

254
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:53,544
Move approval, Mr. President.

255
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:54,124
Second.

256
00:20:54,764 --> 00:21:00,267
Motion by, under motion by Councilor, Vice President Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

257
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:01,347
All those in favor?

258
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:01,587
Aye.

259
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:02,628
Motion passes.

260
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,908
We're under suspension, Mr. President.

261
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:05,209
While we're under suspension.

262
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,070
Paper 17-433.

263
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:07,070
17.

264
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:14,954
It's under reports and deadline, reports due and deadlines, Mr. President.

265
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,895
This is the 90-day review of Annie's Pizzeria.

266
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:16,935
17-433.

267
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:27,915
In his pizzeria, let us examine your special permit hours, 90 day review, October 3rd, 2017.

268
00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:31,037
Councilor Knight.

269
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:43,385
Mr. President, I'd ask that this matter be placed on next week's agenda and that the business owner be notified to come and appeal before us so that we can discuss any complaints or concerns that have come up during the first 90 days of operation with the extended hours license.

270
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:43,946
Thank you.

271
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:58,150
I as one counselor haven't got any complaints and I don't know if anybody else has but usually if there's no complaints we kind of leave it on the agenda for a little longer so they can always take it up at another time.

272
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,672
I don't know how the council feels I just feel like why drag the business owner in if there's been no complaints.

273
00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:05,678
Mr. President.

274
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:06,819
Vice President Mox.

275
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:19,444
Just if I could, in the past when we've had 30, 60 or 90 day reviews, does the city clerk reach out to the petitioner to let him know when the review is before the council?

276
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:20,845
Mr. Clerk.

277
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:30,588
We will now because the conference has requested it.

278
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:34,472
So we don't just initiate it based on the day that Hussain 36th announced it?

279
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:39,158
This petitioner has been checking in and waiting for this opportunity.

280
00:22:42,503 --> 00:22:51,551
Tonight move approval the paper if I may just one more so Clark Finn the petitioner wants to come before us Extended I was

281
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:10,480
I think the council, if I'm correct, staggered the hours, 90 days, these particular hours, and based on their view, they moved to another.

282
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,000
That's right, yes.

283
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,781
Staggered hours, so that's why.

284
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:15,701
So after 90 days, he was gonna get an extended.

285
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,621
Yeah, it was one extra hour.

286
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:18,981
Okay, sounds good.

287
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:21,222
On the motion by Councilor Knight.

288
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:22,642
Seconded by?

289
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:23,602
I second.

290
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,643
By Councilor Scarpel, all those in favor?

291
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:26,043
Aye.

292
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:26,423
Aye.

293
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:27,343
Motion passes.

294
00:23:28,498 --> 00:23:30,799
Motion to revert back to regular business.

295
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:35,321
Yes.

296
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:35,321
1672.

297
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:40,424
Petitions, presentations, and civil matters.

298
00:23:40,444 --> 00:23:50,689
16672, petition by Joseph Biglioni, 59 Garfield Avenue, Memphis, Mass., to address the council with a citizen's report on an open meeting law violation of Chapter 74 Board

299
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,390
from the Attorney General's office.

300
00:23:55,171 --> 00:23:58,631
Good evening, Joe Villione, again, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

301
00:23:59,191 --> 00:24:12,454
When I attended a film screening in this very room, three members of what they called a public access TV board introduced themselves to me right outside, including Paul Garrity, who I've known for many years, formerly of Medford community, Cablevision.

302
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:19,095
As we citizens have kept a firm eye on access, I asked members of the council in the school committee

303
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:25,774
if they knew about this public access TV board, which is what they told me was the name of it.

304
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:35,021
The councilors and the person from the school committee had no idea, no idea, and then Brianna Lungo-Kern put it on the agenda for the next week.

305
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:48,773
So I filed a violation of the open meeting law, and on September 19th, 2017, when we were all at the auditorium, the attorney general's office found that they were not in compliance.

306
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:55,309
that they kept this board, which went on for a year and a half, maybe two years, secret from the public.

307
00:24:55,349 --> 00:25:07,473
There were no open meeting laws of a board designed to spend the money that a former city councilor worked very hard to save this city, and now we have this room.

308
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:10,814
So it's kind of like the fruit of the poisonous tree.

309
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:15,276
If you have a board that's operating and the public is not aware of it,

310
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:25,347
And then they get to spend our money, ostensibly, or the administration or the high school or whomever spent the money is getting advice from this board.

311
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:32,509
It flies in the face of transparency, open government, partners in progress.

312
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,050
There are no partners.

313
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:37,310
Neil Osborne and I have spoken about this.

314
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,591
He called it very frustrating.

315
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,973
The diversity director called it very frustrating.

316
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:49,700
He renamed his, his title is now Director of Diversity and Inclusion, which is like, okay, we have to have inclusion in this community.

317
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:56,325
Now, when Mayor McGlynn had his tribunal with a priest, Fred Lasky, and Allison Goldsberry of the school,

318
00:25:57,572 --> 00:26:19,198
Citizens came up citizens came out to the tribunal but unbeknownst to anyone Mayor McGlynn had decided to put it here and I think vice president of the council might feel our pain when it comes to the parking commission Maybe he felt a similar kind of slight that we're all working with this tribunal the mayor's given us and all of a sudden we come in here in the mayor McGlynn's in the next room with all these

319
00:26:21,258 --> 00:26:26,863
this huge dossier that he gave to people, they had been planning it all along while a tribunal was happening.

320
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:28,364
So this is not open government.

321
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:29,225
That's deceitful.

322
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:30,166
That is not right.

323
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,669
And the tribunal itself said, don't put it at the high school.

324
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:35,330
Put it in a central location.

325
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:36,792
So Mayor McGlynn put it here.

326
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:37,612
Now we're stuck with it.

327
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:39,914
So the fruit of the poisonous tree.

328
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:43,317
You have a committee that flew under the radar.

329
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:44,759
Now we know about it.

330
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:46,660
Now they're on the Attorney General's site.

331
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,561
You can see Chapter 74 board.

332
00:26:49,938 --> 00:26:54,369
And Roy Belson called it a Chapter 74 board and they had to have it for the vocational school.

333
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:55,973
What does that have to do with public access?

334
00:26:56,695 --> 00:26:57,357
What do we do now?

335
00:26:58,774 --> 00:27:12,577
The station manager was in attendance at the meeting but they were also discussing the station manager so if this board discussed the hiring of a station manager and the public had no input we don't know if this person has a thin resume.

336
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:23,720
Maybe all the station manager did was the lighting for some tribute band which is on his resume and it's like okay this public knows a little bit about public access and it's been held back from us for 30 years.

337
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,194
We worked very hard.

338
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:37,506
Some of us in this room worked very, very hard for this, and to find a Chapter 74 board that I have to find out at a film screening in the parking lot of the high school is beyond outrageous.

339
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:43,072
Now, we have very smart people in this administration.

340
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:45,813
So they cannot feign ignorance.

341
00:27:46,113 --> 00:27:47,554
They cannot feign ignorance.

342
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:51,056
They have to admit that this was done intentionally.

343
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:52,336
What can we do about it?

344
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:53,217
Can we go backwards?

345
00:27:54,157 --> 00:28:00,961
Are we forced to live with the determinations of this quasi board, which had people from Revere, New Hampshire?

346
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:02,842
These people were not Medford people.

347
00:28:04,106 --> 00:28:05,947
And the station manager lives in Woburn.

348
00:28:06,348 --> 00:28:08,449
And he came from Brookline Access TV.

349
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:09,890
What does he know about Medford?

350
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,851
We need a Medford station manager.

351
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:25,861
So I submit to this council, because of this board violation, which took a lot of hours on my part to bring to the attorney general's attention, to find that they violated the law, we shouldn't be stuck with the determinations.

352
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,742
We should have a whole clean slate.

353
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:30,804
There's going to be an open house here October 15 for two hours.

354
00:28:30,864 --> 00:28:31,785
Does anyone know about it?

355
00:28:33,106 --> 00:28:38,889
So October 15th, 10 in the morning to noon, there will be an open house at the TV station.

356
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,269
No one knows anything about this.

357
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:43,030
You might need a quarry check to come in here.

358
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:49,733
But because of our hard work, Ben Brown told me last night that they're going to waive the quarry if you mail your shows in.

359
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:52,734
Why did I have to fight so hard for it September 19th?

360
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,497
I mean, you know, you shouldn't have to file a court.

361
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:59,561
Every access station I talk to about this is laughing at us.

362
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:11,212
And they cannot believe that our city solicitor told me on Thursday that he created the quarry in this agreement, but he blamed Ben Brown for all of the five pages.

363
00:29:11,272 --> 00:29:14,696
And I'll do respect to Mr. Brown and no respect to the city solicitor.

364
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:15,997
The legalese in there,

365
00:29:16,858 --> 00:29:18,519
Some young man did not come up with that.

366
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,380
This has the fingerprints of a certain lawyer in the city all over it.

367
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,922
So we're being denied access.

368
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:29,483
And the material I'm doing is Somerville.

369
00:29:29,924 --> 00:29:30,964
Woodburn should be seeing it.

370
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,385
I mean, yeah, Medford should be seeing it.

371
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:34,205
And you know, Dan Hurley does a show after me.

372
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:37,147
So Dan Hurley works for state rep Paul Donato.

373
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,648
And he does a great show called Somerville Pundits.

374
00:29:40,308 --> 00:29:44,310
And if we had a Medford station manager who knew about Dan Hurley and Johnny Byers,

375
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,072
And, uh, Counselor De La Russo's a good friend of Johnny Byers.

376
00:29:48,432 --> 00:29:54,315
I want to see Counselor De La Russo step up to the plate, call his friend Johnny Byers, and get him here at the station doing his sports show.

377
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:57,197
Because the stumbling blocks are keeping Johnny from coming here.

378
00:29:57,237 --> 00:29:58,398
He's afraid of getting sued.

379
00:29:58,758 --> 00:29:59,518
He told me this.

380
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,700
He goes, Joe, you told me about the producer agreement.

381
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,420
I can't sign it.

382
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,281
I don't want to get sued.

383
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:04,861
And that's the problem.

384
00:30:05,522 --> 00:30:10,324
So Elena Nurever, I guess her name is, from the old TV3, she signed all the documents.

385
00:30:10,364 --> 00:30:11,344
She's going to be on the air.

386
00:30:11,964 --> 00:30:23,549
Meanwhile, because of this Chapter 74 violation, we're watching the Three Stooges, Dedham TV, Westford TV, TV, Arlington TV, it's all coming to Medford.

387
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:29,011
And once again, just like TV3, when that woman that was the station manager did her movies with our equipment.

388
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:30,844
We're back to ground zero.

389
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:32,405
We're back to this circle.

390
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:33,366
It's gone full circle.

391
00:30:33,386 --> 00:30:34,866
We are back to the same problem.

392
00:30:35,587 --> 00:30:36,387
I don't want to be here.

393
00:30:36,407 --> 00:30:41,670
I told Robert Mayocko, the former council president, I'll tell President Caraviello, I don't want to be up here every week, sir.

394
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,510
I want you free of me.

395
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,232
I want to be on AXS TV, sir.

396
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:47,732
So I think you owe me one.

397
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:49,453
I would like you to go to bat for me, sir.

398
00:30:49,993 --> 00:30:51,094
Get me on AXS TV.

399
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:52,835
I don't care about the quarry.

400
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:57,345
You know, and Adam Knight doesn't care about the quarry, but I think 60,000 other people do.

401
00:30:58,086 --> 00:31:04,493
What I care about, Mr. Caraviello, Council President, is the legalese where we can be sued because it's Tuesday.

402
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:05,635
That's not fair.

403
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,738
So if you could do me a favor, Councilor Caraviello, and go to bat for me.

404
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,640
I just want my shows on the air.

405
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:11,662
No nonsense.

406
00:31:12,322 --> 00:31:12,963
They're good shows.

407
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:14,004
They're clean shows.

408
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:16,287
You would be happy to watch them.

409
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,431
Then you won't have to read Medford Info Central because I'd be too busy doing my shows.

410
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:21,193
I mean, I think it's a fair bargain.

411
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,175
So that's what I have to say tonight.

412
00:31:23,235 --> 00:31:25,057
The administration's in violation.

413
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,118
Shame on Roy Belson.

414
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:28,962
The diversity director asked Roy Belson to leave.

415
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:32,983
Mr. Belson, God bless him.

416
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:34,443
He's done some good work for this community.

417
00:31:34,903 --> 00:31:37,224
But sometimes term limits gotta kick in.

418
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:43,665
And Belson, I just don't think you're doing the right thing for the community, taking advantage of public access for the school.

419
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:52,467
You and Stephanie Burke and my good friend Mark Rumley, shame on the three of you because you were the ones I went to for public access.

420
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:56,748
And you people are acting worse than TV3 because you should know better.

421
00:31:57,528 --> 00:31:58,809
They were a nonprofit.

422
00:31:59,069 --> 00:32:03,190
You are our public servants and you're serving yourselves.

423
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:03,870
It's got to end.

424
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,050
It's got to go now.

425
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:10,312
Then Brown should go through the process of really showing us that he knows about feedback.

426
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:11,612
One final thing before I stop.

427
00:32:12,112 --> 00:32:14,653
On September 19th, every speaker at the podium

428
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,329
was getting huge feedback.

429
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:19,071
And I had just come out of band practice, as you know.

430
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:24,595
So as you all know, I stood eight inches or maybe a foot behind the mic, and I got no feedback.

431
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:29,480
So when I asked Ben Brown last night, he said, well, I couldn't run back here to the studio to adjust the volume.

432
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,561
I said, what are you talking about?

433
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,362
All you had to do was get people.

434
00:32:32,762 --> 00:32:34,444
He's the audio expert on his resume.

435
00:32:35,064 --> 00:32:35,525
I'm sorry.

436
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:38,627
All you had to do was stand back here, and the feedback would have went away.

437
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:40,889
But we need a station manager that knows this.

438
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:42,210
We need an older person.

439
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,384
You know, as Chris Donovan's out there, Joe Fortunato, I want to help.

440
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,547
There's a lot of us out there that know what we're doing.

441
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:49,728
We're not young.

442
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:56,276
You know, first time managing a station, when I looked at his resume, he claims otherwise, but it's his first time.

443
00:32:57,117 --> 00:32:59,099
And I've managed radio stations.

444
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,301
We know how this works.

445
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:04,183
Fortunato's out there, Donovan's out there, the Gravity Company was here.

446
00:33:04,203 --> 00:33:06,225
There's a lot of great resources in Medford.

447
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:12,228
We need someone that knows Medford, that loves Medford, and that wants to help everyone in this room and all 60,000 people.

448
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:13,889
Thank you so much for your time.

449
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:14,590
Thank you.

450
00:33:17,192 --> 00:33:18,152
Motion to receive and place on file.

451
00:33:18,172 --> 00:33:20,494
Motion by Councilor Naito to receive and place on file.

452
00:33:20,514 --> 00:33:21,174
Seconded by?

453
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,255
Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

454
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:23,115
By Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

455
00:33:23,155 --> 00:33:23,776
All those in favor?

456
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:24,196
Aye.

457
00:33:24,216 --> 00:33:25,217
Motion passes.

458
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,518
Mr. President, motion to take.

459
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:31,499
And we're finished with that part of it right now.

460
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:32,799
If you'd like to come back after.

461
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:36,020
The suspension of the rule.

462
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,781
I suspend the rules, so to speak.

463
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:40,701
Motion by Councilor Lococo to suspend the rules.

464
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:41,361
It will only take me a minute.

465
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:45,222
I spoke a long while ago about I don't want a show.

466
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:46,143
I don't have a show.

467
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:47,303
I don't want anything like that.

468
00:33:47,563 --> 00:33:52,624
But I know people who do and they cannot understand how we don't have this in Medford.

469
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,105
And I talked to somebody who runs the

470
00:33:57,078 --> 00:34:00,360
station in Somerville, and he's right.

471
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,201
They laughed.

472
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:04,823
They said to me, I don't understand what's wrong with you people.

473
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:10,627
And when Bob Pinto was running, we had to have somebody come from Somerville to tape it.

474
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:12,548
It's absolutely ridiculous.

475
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:18,893
And we have someone running for mayor, where he should be able to go on once a week and introduce himself.

476
00:34:19,353 --> 00:34:23,198
So I have nothing personal about it, but I really want to get this done.

477
00:34:23,218 --> 00:34:27,844
I've been in Medford 17 years, and for 17 years we've been talking about it.

478
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:29,906
It's absolutely crazy.

479
00:34:30,547 --> 00:34:32,609
So I thank you.

480
00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:33,931
Thank you.

481
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:34,532
And that's it.

482
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:35,493
Thank you very much.

483
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:51,260
The part that I think is concerning is when we go back to the September 19 meeting and I don't know if Mr. Burns is in the other room or not but the question was asked when he came to the podium and he couldn't answer the question.

484
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,361
I know the solicitor is here so he may want to answer it.

485
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:59,165
I just don't know what somebody can do to make a presentation.

486
00:34:59,846 --> 00:35:04,551
If they can submit it by mail, which means they need a query check, if they don't need a query check.

487
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:10,978
Right now, do all you counselors need a query check because you're in a building where you're close to children that are outside in the school?

488
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:13,319
The next question begs itself to City Hall.

489
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:28,730
Does every member of City Hall, every employee need a query check because if a parent comes in there or a taxpayer comes in there with a child and the child goes to the bathroom and the child is not with the parent and there's an employee there, does that subject the city or the employee to some kind of liability of a query check?

490
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,210
I don't know.

491
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:34,034
But I think this whole issue has opened up a great question needs to be asked.

492
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:38,577
Why do we need a query check and under what conditions and circumstances do we need it?

493
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:50,214
If I understand this thing properly, if I'm a candidate for office like the seven of you are, a candidate for office, and if you come in here, supposedly you don't need a query check, but if you submit your

494
00:35:51,515 --> 00:36:02,467
take a desk by mail when you need a query check, or can you come in at any time, even though you're independent of your role as a counselor being here tonight, walk around the building, and for that purpose, do you need a query check?

495
00:36:02,848 --> 00:36:09,195
Do employees in this building, custodians in this building, do they need a query check as it relates to their interaction with students?

496
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:09,535
Yes.

497
00:36:10,696 --> 00:36:14,759
I understand that teachers, when they come on board, there's a query check sign on them.

498
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:15,659
I understand all of that.

499
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:17,400
But I don't know the nuances about everyone.

500
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:28,686
Contractors, and I think we had here a couple of weeks ago, there was a gentleman come up, said he was putting lights in a certain part of the building, and in their second shift the question was asked, they said that they would be getting a query check.

501
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:29,727
Okay, that's all well and good.

502
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:36,031
But I'd like to, I know the solicitor's here, but I'd like to have the council have a report that comes out that basically said,

503
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:39,872
How is a query check going to be implemented?

504
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:48,755
And more importantly, if a taxpayer citizen wants to come up, work this room, submit a tape, does that taxpayer citizen have to be query checked or not?

505
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:54,057
I mean, because don't forget, this whole idea of public access was just what it's for, public access.

506
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:58,898
And if it was in any other location but this place here, I don't think we would be talking about a query check.

507
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:04,540
But I understand that this has its own entrance, its own locks, and it's separate from the main entrance of the building.

508
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:11,722
And I believe that in and of itself should probably give some credence that a query check is not needed, however this room is being used.

509
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:18,407
So I think we need some clarification to finalize this thing and we can move on with an election which is right around the corner.

510
00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:20,489
And let me just say this one last thing about the election.

511
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:21,470
It's a damn shame.

512
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:35,000
It's a damn shame, and I use the word damn shame, that this room and the access used for this was not in place prior to the primary election where all the candidates, incumbents, would have had an opportunity to come and make their presentation.

513
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,522
This unfortunately seems to be at a last minute.

514
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:39,184
It's a quick ploy to get itself in.

515
00:37:39,484 --> 00:37:40,445
You've got your notices.

516
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:43,327
The last one is tomorrow or the next day this week.

517
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:45,729
It's sort of like- It's sort of like- They've extended the schedule.

518
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,172
They have extended the schedule but it's a little unfair.

519
00:37:48,772 --> 00:37:50,534
This has been running around for a long period of time.

520
00:37:51,095 --> 00:37:58,422
They had $650,000 of taxpayers' money from Verizon and Comcast that was used to put this building together.

521
00:37:58,462 --> 00:38:06,029
This has been taking place for a long period of time and I think it's just a little bit unfair and especially when the rules are inconsistent right now.

522
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:10,653
I think that's what we need to know whether you're an incumbent or a newcomer running for this office.

523
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:20,338
So, I would say before you take it and receive it and place it on file, I think those questions should be answered before you take that and receive it and place it on file.

524
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:20,938
Thank you.

525
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:21,618
Thank you.

526
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:25,640
Mr. Solicitor, the paper's already been disposed of, Mr. President.

527
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,880
That is correct, Councilman Knight.

528
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:28,481
Name and address of the record, please.

529
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:29,621
Yes, I'm Mark Rumley.

530
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,682
I'm the city solicitor.

531
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:33,043
I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

532
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:38,865
There's been some discussion about the Corey Check requirement for producers at cable access television.

533
00:38:39,305 --> 00:38:41,627
So I'm going to run through it just so it's understood.

534
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:48,531
First, Corey Checks are required under Chapter 71 of the Massachusetts General Law and

535
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:51,652
Massachusetts Code of Regulations 803.

536
00:38:51,872 --> 00:39:09,456
I can't give you the specific sections off the top of my head and therefore anyone who is employed in the school system or who would be a contractor who works here during different things like a roof or lighting or anything of that nature and it even goes to volunteers if

537
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:18,184
they would have, or the possibility of having, direct and unmonitored contact with a student, with a child.

538
00:39:18,364 --> 00:39:19,185
It is required.

539
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:23,469
This studio is part of the high school building.

540
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:31,575
It may have a separate entrance, but it also has other doors in this room which could lead out, which do lead out to the school proper.

541
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:34,518
And it is on school grounds now.

542
00:39:35,258 --> 00:39:41,742
The studio is also used, I'm not sure if, I think it's through the vocational school, but it's for the students who are involved in media arts.

543
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:51,868
There is a time every day in which there's an overlap of time in which the studio could be used for public access and can be used by students for media arts.

544
00:39:51,928 --> 00:40:03,936
And because of that overlap, there is a possibility that producers who come here to produce, bless you, that producers who come here to produce public access television shows could have

545
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:07,238
unmonitored and direct contact with students.

546
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:17,185
Therefore, if they're going to be a producer who's going to work here in this school building where this access studio is, they must be quarried once.

547
00:40:17,866 --> 00:40:20,007
Now, there are two exceptions to that.

548
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:30,355
The first exception is a question that came up a couple of weeks ago when Ben Brown said he'd like to give those candidates for public office the opportunity to have some type of

549
00:40:31,816 --> 00:40:36,817
production, a limit on the time perhaps, but it would be given to every single candidate.

550
00:40:37,357 --> 00:40:50,179
Now, I explained to him in a way which is a lot longer than I can explain tonight how he is the producer of that show and everyone here would be, those who would be running for office, would be invited to come here.

551
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:59,281
That doesn't rise to the level of being the producer of a public access show because you're responded to an invitation to come up and do a political spot.

552
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:01,503
So they would not have to be quarried.

553
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:03,564
That was established a couple of weeks ago.

554
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:17,935
And in a conversation that I had with Mr. Brown this week, he said, if a producer is going to produce their show or whatever it is, their product, off-premises, and not come to the school, do they have to be quarried?

555
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:19,076
Well, obviously they don't.

556
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:23,019
They'd have to be a member of public access, but they wouldn't have to be quarried.

557
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:35,192
The requirement of a CORI check arises because of this location, the overlap in time with public access and the media students, and the requirements of state statute and regulation.

558
00:41:35,832 --> 00:41:38,856
It wasn't put in there just to make somebody's life difficult.

559
00:41:39,276 --> 00:41:45,243
It was put in there because it's required by statute and regulation, and that's why it's in the producer's agreement.

560
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,020
That's it.

561
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,281
Thank you.

562
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,652
I think it was a two-page contract that also needs to be signed by anybody that wants to produce a show.

563
00:42:02,592 --> 00:42:09,295
There's some people who... Yes, there's a producer's agreement, and it deals with their productions, their liabilities, and that sort of thing.

564
00:42:09,955 --> 00:42:20,120
The notion that no adult is ever liable for any actions they take, and a public access producer would be just like that, that notion is just simply not true as a matter of law.

565
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,762
If you libel somebody, or if you do something to infringe on another person's rights, you could be liable for it.

566
00:42:26,122 --> 00:42:28,764
and the producer's agreement acknowledges that.

567
00:42:29,324 --> 00:42:37,089
The original one which was sent to me by Mr. Brown had some clarifications that it needed.

568
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:45,534
The major input that the law department made on that was to insert the CORI requirement for the reasons that I've just described to you.

569
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:47,975
Thank you.

570
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:48,696
You're welcome.

571
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:51,837
Okay, call for the orders of the day, Mr. President.

572
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:52,358
Thank you.

573
00:42:53,752 --> 00:42:58,256
17, 675.

574
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:58,256
I wanted to respond to Mr. Rumbach.

575
00:42:58,596 --> 00:42:59,016
It's very important.

576
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:00,418
Point of Parliamentary Inquiry, Mr. President.

577
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:01,519
Counselor Knight.

578
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:03,020
Paper's been disposed of.

579
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,541
Gentleman's had an opportunity to discuss on this.

580
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:06,003
This is very important for the public.

581
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:06,823
This was my paper.

582
00:43:06,843 --> 00:43:08,465
This isn't even an item that's on the agenda at this point.

583
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,367
The paper has been disposed of.

584
00:43:10,707 --> 00:43:11,828
Please suspend the rules again.

585
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:14,951
If somebody wants to suspend the rules again,

586
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:21,930
It's only fair because Mr. Rumley was not appropriate and I have to straighten it out.

587
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:22,410
Okay.

588
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:23,591
Thank you.

589
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,532
Joe Villion, 59 Garfield Ave.

590
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:41,562
Now at Somerville Cable we are separate in Union Square and we have children come in and they pay $200 a week so we generate $2,000 every 10 children that come in and the children are all around us producers and they do annoy us because we're trying to do radio and they're all yelling and screaming.

591
00:43:42,502 --> 00:43:45,743
I shut down Winchester High School four nights, four weeks in a row.

592
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:50,223
No one had a quarry check, and Mr. Rumley, all due respect, is incorrect.

593
00:43:50,983 --> 00:44:06,046
If you have direct contact with children, unsupervised, in a school, not in a public access center, if there are doors here, they should be locked, because in Winchester and in Wakefield, we have public access centers and there are no quarries.

594
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:10,787
Now, I talked to many TV stations, many, and one of the executive directors said to me,

595
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:12,748
That's just absurd.

596
00:44:13,328 --> 00:44:14,650
So it is a stumbling block.

597
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,112
It is a scary thing for people who want to do Access TV.

598
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:19,674
It is the antithesis of outreach.

599
00:44:20,214 --> 00:44:31,724
You have a separate facility on the high school ground, but Wakefield and Winchester and so many stations around the Duxbury, so many using the high school, do not ask for CORI checks.

600
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:33,606
That is absolutely wrong.

601
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:38,550
It can be contested in a court of law, and I guarantee you I can win on that point.

602
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:44,013
But the second point is the five-page producer agreement, not the two-page producer agreement.

603
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:45,974
And I agree with Solicitor Romley.

604
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:49,716
You've got to have the libel statute in there, but you can have one page.

605
00:44:50,157 --> 00:44:52,358
One page from Hingham, one page from Malden.

606
00:44:52,618 --> 00:44:53,799
You don't need five pages.

607
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:00,443
And what the law department seems to have inserted into this, which I don't believe Ben Brown could have done, but allegedly, I'm not sure.

608
00:45:01,423 --> 00:45:11,789
You would have to hire a city attorney along with your own attorney, and it goes on and on and on in a way that is the antithesis of outreach, the facilitation of programming.

609
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:12,509
I don't know.

610
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:18,232
I've been doing this since 1979, so I think I know more than the city solicitor on this aspect of it.

611
00:45:18,852 --> 00:45:20,273
I have been in access longer than anyone.

612
00:45:20,293 --> 00:45:20,713
I've been on the BBC.

613
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:21,754
What a clarification, Mr. President.

614
00:45:21,774 --> 00:45:23,155
What a clarification, Counselor Knight.

615
00:45:23,395 --> 00:45:24,896
The gentleman's talking about a legal document.

616
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:28,558
Is he proclaiming that he has more knowledge than the city solicitor about the law?

617
00:45:29,438 --> 00:45:30,438
know about the document.

618
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:35,619
There's a big difference, sir, but then again, all you do is do point of interruption.

619
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:36,639
Point of interruption.

620
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:39,000
I was just trying to clarify because- We're clarifying it.

621
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,580
I know more about public access and signing those documents, I believe, than the city solicitor.

622
00:45:43,981 --> 00:45:46,361
A five-page document's unheard of in Access TV.

623
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:46,961
What do I know?

624
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:49,642
I've only been doing it about as long as you've been alive.

625
00:45:50,202 --> 00:45:55,863
So if you had a little respect for your elders and listened instead of talked, you might learn something about Access TV.

626
00:45:55,903 --> 00:45:57,183
Point of personal reference, Mr. President.

627
00:45:58,203 --> 00:45:59,264
respect the Counselor.

628
00:45:59,284 --> 00:45:59,684
Thank you.

629
00:45:59,704 --> 00:46:01,065
I think this is why we have an agenda Mr. President.

630
00:46:01,086 --> 00:46:03,427
I think if he respects his elders I can respect the Counselor.

631
00:46:03,447 --> 00:46:06,110
Point of personal privilege is the Counselor or his body Mr. President.

632
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:06,850
Thank you.

633
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,571
We have an agenda.

634
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,211
That's correct.

635
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:10,313
That's why we have an agenda so things like this don't happen.

636
00:46:10,773 --> 00:46:11,634
I call for the orders of the day.

637
00:46:11,654 --> 00:46:14,256
What things like this is five pages is too much.

638
00:46:14,636 --> 00:46:15,037
One page.

639
00:46:15,937 --> 00:46:18,880
One page to express liability is very simple.

640
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:22,503
One page and then from

641
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:24,946
the Cory check out the window.

642
00:46:24,986 --> 00:46:25,546
It's insane.

643
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:29,167
It makes no sense on school grounds because no one else does it.

644
00:46:29,688 --> 00:46:35,630
The city of Medford is always the city that is being ridiculed by other stations for censorship policies.

645
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:36,771
It's pure censorship.

646
00:46:37,511 --> 00:46:37,931
That's it.

647
00:46:38,572 --> 00:46:39,132
So it's bad.

648
00:46:39,152 --> 00:46:39,412
Thank you.

649
00:46:39,832 --> 00:46:40,092
Thank you.

650
00:46:40,112 --> 00:46:40,833
Mr. President.

651
00:46:41,453 --> 00:46:41,553
Yes.

652
00:46:41,613 --> 00:46:45,595
As the city solicitor, I am not going to sit back and say

653
00:46:46,275 --> 00:46:56,118
that censorship is ever part of the mission of the law department, of the city of Medford, of any of its officials, elected or otherwise.

654
00:46:56,358 --> 00:47:06,942
We're not censoring anything, but what we're going to do is to make sure that our school children are going to be able to come to this building and that this is going to be a safe environment.

655
00:47:07,382 --> 00:47:10,783
A quarry check is not prohibited, it is required.

656
00:47:12,144 --> 00:47:12,404
Thank you.

657
00:47:14,352 --> 00:47:15,012
Mr. President, may I?

658
00:47:15,192 --> 00:47:16,192
Name and address of the record, please.

659
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:21,034
Roy Bellson, Superintendent of Schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.

660
00:47:21,054 --> 00:47:24,795
Mr. President, members of the council, I just want to clarify a couple of things.

661
00:47:25,835 --> 00:47:30,976
Chapter 74 is the Vocational Education Act that governs vocational education.

662
00:47:31,556 --> 00:47:32,977
It has been around for a long time.

663
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:37,358
Advisory committees have been part of Chapter 74 for a long time.

664
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:38,645
It's not new.

665
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:49,774
The Medford School Committee knows about Chapter 74 Advisory Committees, and many of you have participated on it, including Councilor Penter at one time, and others have been on these advisory committees.

666
00:47:49,794 --> 00:47:50,815
It's not an unknown thing.

667
00:47:51,555 --> 00:47:52,896
There was one error that was made.

668
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:56,379
It was made without thinking it was an error.

669
00:47:56,399 --> 00:48:03,645
It was simply that advisory committees meet and they go over the program that they were interested in, the Multimedia Center for Students.

670
00:48:04,528 --> 00:48:11,211
Their issue wasn't community access, their issue was the multimedia program for students, because it's required by Chapter 74.

671
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:16,413
Chapter 74 put out a manual and they increased the idea that the open meeting law should apply.

672
00:48:17,473 --> 00:48:26,857
The director at that particular time didn't see that, didn't pay attention to it at that particular time, put it on the website for the school thing and didn't think it needed to be posted.

673
00:48:27,258 --> 00:48:32,460
Typically a public body is a body that deliberates and then can make a decision.

674
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:43,446
as opposed to a public body or a body that simply advises an administrator who then advises a governing body like a school committee what to do, so it was an error.

675
00:48:43,646 --> 00:48:49,090
That's all it was and it didn't necessarily affect anything to deal with community access.

676
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:53,169
People ask the question, well, what does Ben Brown fit in this situation?

677
00:48:53,209 --> 00:48:59,594
Well, Ben Brown, if he's going to manage this place, is going to interact with the teaching staff of the vocational school.

678
00:49:00,134 --> 00:49:05,078
So his name is going to come up, or his position will come up in that process.

679
00:49:05,718 --> 00:49:07,259
There's no attempt to block anything.

680
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:15,325
I think we all recognize that this space is a good space, and we hope that it will be a terrific space for the community and a terrific space for the young people.

681
00:49:15,705 --> 00:49:19,248
And the good news is that we can share it, and we can do a lot of good things together.

682
00:49:20,008 --> 00:49:26,793
As to the Corey check, what's to prohibit a program that's being jointly produced by young people along with community members?

683
00:49:27,093 --> 00:49:27,834
What if they're together?

684
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:29,796
What if they do a program together?

685
00:49:29,816 --> 00:49:32,498
I think that's highly desirable that our young people do that.

686
00:49:32,538 --> 00:49:40,824
But if they do that, then it would be good for them to know that the people who are going to be doing it in this space are people that we have checked out.

687
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,748
I think safety is always on our minds.

688
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:45,349
I think we all agree on that.

689
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:46,590
It doesn't hurt.

690
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:54,134
If an individual feels that the Cori check has been unduly denied, they have the right to get it and appeal.

691
00:49:54,954 --> 00:50:02,839
Now, do you think that any of us would ever be able to stand up in front of you and say that a person who had an insurance violation is a reason for denying them the right to come in here?

692
00:50:03,419 --> 00:50:13,131
But if a person has been involved with molestation, or the person been involved with assault and battery, and a person's been involved with destruction of property, maybe we should know that.

693
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:14,781
Maybe we should know that.

694
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:17,122
So I don't think it's unreasonable.

695
00:50:17,602 --> 00:50:19,404
I think it's something that we should consider.

696
00:50:19,504 --> 00:50:20,264
And I think it's there.

697
00:50:20,744 --> 00:50:28,269
And I think as far as Chapter 74 goes, despite what the individual has to say, it was totally different than the community media thing.

698
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:32,152
And it's really a part of us making sure that we're in compliance with the state.

699
00:50:32,232 --> 00:50:33,513
We can stick with the open meeting law.

700
00:50:34,053 --> 00:50:34,914
It won't happen again.

701
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:38,515
In fact, we've posted all the meetings going forward to the advisory committees.

702
00:50:38,575 --> 00:50:41,416
And every shop in the school has an advisory committee.

703
00:50:41,796 --> 00:50:42,536
Every shop.

704
00:50:43,097 --> 00:50:44,437
And some of you have participated.

705
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:51,399
We appreciate that because it's important for the young people to get expertise, not only from Medford, but from practitioners around the Commonwealth.

706
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,840
We appreciate your listening.

707
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,380
Thank you.

708
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,261
Thank you.

709
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:55,261
16, 675.

710
00:50:58,238 --> 00:51:07,623
through the chair, if we could get a copy of the, I'm not sure who has it, a copy of the decision stating there was an open meeting law violation.

711
00:51:07,643 --> 00:51:12,206
I find it more than a simple error and I definitely want to take a read.

712
00:51:12,366 --> 00:51:14,747
Just to address that, surely we can give you a copy of that.

713
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:17,689
I'd also say this, and I know this is beleaguered a little bit.

714
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:34,541
When the allegation of the open meeting law violation came up from the petitioner back in June there was a response made by the school department almost immediately in which all of the documents of this committee were given, about 280 pages were given to the petitioner.

715
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:47,030
He continued to allege the violation of the open meeting law and when the city responded, the city responded in the very beginning of July we said it was a violation of the open meeting law to the petitioner.

716
00:51:48,018 --> 00:51:51,659
And then the Attorney General months later said, yes, it is a violation.

717
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,620
We've never hid that.

718
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,221
It was on the school calendar, but it was not posted.

719
00:51:56,801 --> 00:52:03,264
So the immediate response by the law department when this allegation was made was that, yes, it should have been posted and it wasn't.

720
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:04,785
The Attorney General said, yes.

721
00:52:06,045 --> 00:52:07,506
It should have been posted and it wasn't.

722
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,108
So next time post it.

723
00:52:09,508 --> 00:52:11,029
So you will have all of that document.

724
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:14,032
And through the Chair, Solicitor Rumley, whose fault was that?

725
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:20,358
I don't know what official in the school department is responsible for the posting.

726
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:23,220
It was on the school calendar from the beginning of the year.

727
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:28,425
And also keep this in mind, that the Chapter 74 committee is required to meet twice a

728
00:52:28,905 --> 00:52:31,666
a year, once before the holidays, once after.

729
00:52:31,987 --> 00:52:32,907
They did meet twice.

730
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:38,970
It was on the school calendar, but not posted the way you would post an open meeting law notice.

731
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:43,732
So I'm not sure who in the school department is responsible to do that, but it was not done.

732
00:52:44,233 --> 00:52:48,955
And when we made our response to the petitioner, we said it wasn't done and it should have.

733
00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:53,957
So it isn't something where there was this clandestine effort to hide anything.

734
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:56,639
As a matter of fact, the response was an admission.

735
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,579
And that was made months ago.

736
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:07,842
So the notion that there was some type of James Bondish effort here to hide up some vocational committee is absolutely nonsense.

737
00:53:08,062 --> 00:53:08,342
Thank you.

738
00:53:08,382 --> 00:53:10,723
So it wasn't just my last question.

739
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:13,004
So it wasn't City Hall's doing.

740
00:53:13,104 --> 00:53:14,704
It was the school department school department.

741
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:14,944
Yes.

742
00:53:16,185 --> 00:53:17,005
Vice President Mox.

743
00:53:17,545 --> 00:53:19,326
I just Mr. Romley.

744
00:53:19,646 --> 00:53:19,806
Yes.

745
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:34,750
I don't mean to put you on the spot, but several weeks ago when this issue was brought up, I asked the superintendent at the time whether or not this would also apply to outside entities that rent this particular building.

746
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:35,812
You mean quarry checks?

747
00:53:36,092 --> 00:53:48,868
Correct and the reason why I asked is because as we all know safety of our students is the utmost important and I agree What you laid out tonight was the fact that there may be an overlap in time.

748
00:53:49,048 --> 00:53:51,371
Yes, and the fact that it's in this building

749
00:53:52,824 --> 00:53:55,125
would lead you to believe that, was it Chapter 74?

750
00:53:56,145 --> 00:53:57,585
Chapter 71 on the quarry.

751
00:53:57,725 --> 00:53:59,145
Chapter 71 would apply.

752
00:53:59,645 --> 00:54:19,709
My question, and I didn't expect the superintendent to answer, but I expected a different answer out of the superintendent is, is this something we also have to look at if we have an entity that rents this building, just say on a Saturday, and students are up here on a Saturday, and there may be some type of interaction, whether it's in a restroom or walking by someone in a hallway,

753
00:54:20,769 --> 00:54:23,933
would the same apply to that Mr. Solicitor?

754
00:54:24,073 --> 00:54:25,355
That's a very interesting question.

755
00:54:25,435 --> 00:54:26,597
It gets into a gray area.

756
00:54:26,617 --> 00:54:28,339
I'm going to give you an example.

757
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,383
I am quarried in another capacity in my life.

758
00:54:32,544 --> 00:54:37,010
I am quarried every single year as a requirement of my vocation.

759
00:54:37,991 --> 00:54:39,572
However, and that's part of the church.

760
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:43,915
However, in that, people that go to church every week are not quarried.

761
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:50,059
But because I'm a deacon, there's a possibility that I might have unmonitored direct contact with children.

762
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,781
As a matter of fact, it's probable, given the role of a deacon.

763
00:54:53,221 --> 00:55:02,948
Now, using that analogy here at the school, with renters, the time when they would be renting, if it's like a Saturday or Sunday, I think that would come into play.

764
00:55:04,109 --> 00:55:11,017
One of the things that the overlap that comes into play with this room is the fact that that would happen during the day or at the end of the school day.

765
00:55:11,618 --> 00:55:20,769
I would defer to the judgment of the Superintendent of course but I would say if there is a higher likelihood of direct unmonitored contact with

766
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:31,291
students in this building, and that's who we have jurisdiction over, then they should be Cori checked because we have contractors Cori checked, bus drivers Cori checked.

767
00:55:32,211 --> 00:55:33,612
Everybody you could imagine.

768
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:39,893
People who would do the grounds if they were doing them under contract would be Cori checked so I'm not the Superintendent.

769
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:49,575
I can't answer that for him, but I would say the higher the likelihood of the unmonitored in direct contact with a child, yes, they should be Cori checked.

770
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:53,377
So how can we gauge the likelihood of interaction?

771
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,239
I guess that's the question.

772
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,620
How do we know?

773
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:05,489
I can tell you from firsthand experience that a particular entity that's been renting this community has been here consistently for probably over 20 years.

774
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:11,231
in the same location in the same building with probably the same interaction.

775
00:56:11,631 --> 00:56:30,815
So this is not a one-off that you'd say well they're coming into the building once and I think it warrants at least some investigation and I would hope it would be from your law office or your law department and not the superintendent of schools because the feedback I've received from the superintendent is kind of

776
00:56:31,495 --> 00:56:37,943
there's no concern and I think it needs to be looked into a little further by the law office.

777
00:56:38,383 --> 00:56:45,952
I would always be available to the superintendent or to any other municipal or school official to assist them in their positions.

778
00:56:46,212 --> 00:56:51,198
I would ask if then you can get together with the superintendent and have a discussion over this because

779
00:56:51,898 --> 00:57:09,690
As we've all stated, and it's not just lip service, from when I stated about security in this building, or the lack of security in this building after hours, and following up with this particular issue, it's all in the same breath as to say we have to look out for the interest of our children.

780
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:20,397
And if there are people in this building that I'm corey-checked, I believe they, as we said with this particular media room, this should be reviewed, Mr. Solicitor.

781
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:25,120
I also feel this before I yield to I guess the Superintendent.

782
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:35,107
The key is direct unmonitored contact and if that's a possibility it's not very prohibitive to have a Cori checked on.

783
00:57:35,127 --> 00:57:39,951
It can be done very quickly and it's not a very intrusive process.

784
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:40,791
Why not?

785
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:45,775
That level of protection especially for children.

786
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:55,130
especially for children so if I can be of assistance to the Superintendent and I would never give that lip service that I would have.

787
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,812
I didn't mean lip service for you.

788
00:57:56,832 --> 00:58:01,456
I meant in the past when we were talking about security and safety of our students.

789
00:58:01,856 --> 00:58:03,097
It's not just lip service.

790
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:05,440
It's something that I really believe in

791
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:21,388
And having three children go through the public schools and knowing what took place today at the Columbus School with someone wielding a knife in a lockdown, it brings it that closer to us and people that are concerned about this issue.

792
00:58:21,448 --> 00:58:22,689
A very relevant example.

793
00:58:22,729 --> 00:58:23,049
Thank you.

794
00:58:24,089 --> 00:58:25,650
So if I may, just for a minute.

795
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:28,712
So we have football games at Hormel Stadium.

796
00:58:29,492 --> 00:58:33,054
So everyone comes through the gate, should be quarry checked because they might sit next to a student.

797
00:58:33,398 --> 00:58:35,959
Mr. Superintendent, that's not clouding the issue.

798
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:37,079
No, I'm not clouding the issue.

799
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:38,300
Who's talking about Hormel Stadium?

800
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,180
Hormel Stadium is a site, is a site.

801
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,501
The building you're standing in right now, Mr. Superintendent.

802
00:58:42,621 --> 00:58:42,861
No.

803
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,661
No one's talking about Hormel Stadium.

804
00:58:44,982 --> 00:58:47,682
Hormel Stadium is the site of student activities.

805
00:58:48,363 --> 00:58:49,463
We have football kids there.

806
00:58:49,503 --> 00:58:50,983
We have cheerleaders there.

807
00:58:51,063 --> 00:58:51,944
We have other people there.

808
00:58:52,324 --> 00:58:57,125
Public access, public areas are not subject to the CORI.

809
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:02,367
Now, it's direct, these key words, direct, unsupervised.

810
00:59:02,927 --> 00:59:09,134
If I'm working with you, if I'm in the area where I'm working directly with you that's direct and unsupervised.

811
00:59:09,774 --> 00:59:11,536
Indirect is not the issue.

812
00:59:11,977 --> 00:59:18,423
People in areas you could be anywhere and have people who are near students and the like or near young people.

813
00:59:18,784 --> 00:59:25,050
That's not the way the Corey statue has been interpreted and applied across the commonwealth, so

814
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:28,403
You know, we could check everybody out everywhere they go.

815
00:59:28,423 --> 00:59:33,825
When you go to the state house, you have to empty your pockets, you have to take off your belt, and you check everything like that.

816
00:59:33,845 --> 00:59:35,825
You can keep going and going and going.

817
00:59:36,226 --> 00:59:40,567
But at some point in time, the terms are direct and unsupervised.

818
00:59:41,007 --> 00:59:47,009
Otherwise, every public gathering where there are young people and families would require everyone to be quarry checked.

819
00:59:47,409 --> 00:59:48,450
It's not the same thing.

820
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:54,192
It's just the way it's been interpreted across the Commonwealth, and I'm sure there are plenty of people that would comment on it.

821
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:55,449
Thank you.

822
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:56,710
Mr. President, just if I could.

823
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,110
Vice President Mox.

824
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:05,532
The superintendent is excellent at circumlocution when it comes to diverting what the issue is.

825
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:05,972
What's that word?

826
01:00:06,272 --> 01:00:07,653
I'll teach you after.

827
01:00:09,193 --> 01:00:18,336
What the issue is, Mr. President, and clearly the issue is not outside of this building because we're not talking about outside this building.

828
01:00:18,356 --> 01:00:21,357
We're talking about a media room inside of the high school.

829
01:00:22,177 --> 01:00:46,912
And what I mentioned is, if you have an outside group, and when I say outside, I mean from outside the city, that rents this particular facility, Mr. President, on a weekly basis for the past, every Saturday for the past 20 years, and they are coming into contact with our students up here, Mr. President, I think it warrants a discussion.

830
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:50,974
And you know, so I'm not cloudy on the issue.

831
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:52,095
I know what the issue is.

832
01:00:52,455 --> 01:00:58,660
And it's not going outside of this building, checking out every little venue that we have to make sure people are Corey checked.

833
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,701
That's just the cloud the issue.

834
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:10,568
The issue is whether or not we're providing adequate security up at this high school, and whether or not we're making sure that when our students are within this building, Mr. President,

835
01:01:10,948 --> 01:01:14,089
They come in contact with people they should come in contact with.

836
01:01:14,689 --> 01:01:21,791
And as the superintendent alluded to a couple of weeks ago, he made it sound like a Corey check could be done within 24 hours.

837
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:33,974
So as the city solicitor mentioned, that's not a large undertaking to ask an entity that's coming into our building, using our classrooms, using our cafeterias, using our

838
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:47,083
gymnasium to ask them to be subjected to the same requirements that someone from the city of Method would come up here and want to put a show on local access.

839
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:54,788
I don't think that's a hardship, Mr. President, and I think in the interest of safety for our students, I think it warrants it, Mr. President.

840
01:01:55,128 --> 01:02:02,293
And I'm a little troubled when I address these particular issues with the superintendent, how he tries to dismiss them, Mr. President.

841
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:09,077
And honestly, I think this issue needs to be addressed, and I would hope that he could sit down with the city solicitor.

842
01:02:09,397 --> 01:02:12,059
I'd be more than happy to attend if we want to have a meeting.

843
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:14,401
But this issue needs to be ironed out.

844
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:18,583
And from what I heard from the city solicitor, as he mentioned, this is a gray issue.

845
01:02:19,284 --> 01:02:24,007
And I think it deserves at least discussion, Mr. President.

846
01:02:24,387 --> 01:02:25,348
Thank you Mr. Vice President.

847
01:02:25,988 --> 01:02:26,628
Very quickly.

848
01:02:26,648 --> 01:02:28,469
Name and address for the record please.

849
01:02:28,929 --> 01:02:30,490
Joe Villon 59 Garfield Ave.

850
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:42,316
When the three people talked to me outside they called it a public access board which is why I so investigative on it and then when I got the documents that the city solicitor referenced it said radio television board.

851
01:02:42,776 --> 01:02:46,058
It was the Attorney General's office that and Mark Rumley who

852
01:02:46,298 --> 01:02:53,664
who told me through Belson it was a chapter 74, but this is what the attendees called it, a public access board.

853
01:02:54,004 --> 01:03:04,713
This is what the document said, radio and television board, so it got me very concerned that the city council and the school committee didn't know about it and in conclusion

854
01:03:06,247 --> 01:03:17,151
They just it's it is a lot of gobbledygook These are these are professionals when mayor Burke and other people including the council president had to respond about the compliance with the Open meeting law.

855
01:03:17,531 --> 01:03:33,017
I believe their documents were filed Mr. Carey element have filed it on time, but the certification paper I believe was filed late and I found that with Paulette van de Kloot Stephanie Burke didn't even do her online training her online training was

856
01:03:33,417 --> 01:03:42,345
for the ethics until I filed an open public records request, so this whole thing of that it was just an honest mistake.

857
01:03:42,765 --> 01:03:44,106
They've been in business far too long.

858
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:45,767
It wasn't an honest mistake.

859
01:03:46,268 --> 01:03:46,928
It was deliberate.

860
01:03:47,189 --> 01:03:47,509
Thank you.

861
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:49,611
If I may move the question.

862
01:03:49,631 --> 01:03:53,394
Move the question to get a copy of the Attorney General's decision.

863
01:03:53,414 --> 01:03:59,439
On the motion by Council Member O'Connor to get a copy of the complaint from Senator Romney.

864
01:04:01,009 --> 01:04:02,670
All those in favor?

865
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:03,150
Aye.

866
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:04,390
Motion passes.

867
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:06,811
May I comment?

868
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:07,992
Regardless.

869
01:04:10,132 --> 01:04:12,013
I really have very little comment.

870
01:04:12,413 --> 01:04:28,599
I just wanted to say it's a sad state of affairs that TV 3 has been off the air for approximately four years and also it would be nice if it was housed instead of here in a central location.

871
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:43,517
As a matter of fact, in my opinion, the demise of Meffitt Square back in 1970 is when they closed Meffitt High School in Forest Street and opened up this high school.

872
01:04:44,497 --> 01:04:45,518
We're talking about TB3.

873
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:46,938
Yeah, exactly.

874
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:48,419
In TB3.

875
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:52,341
And they put the high school here in the West Meffitt Woods.

876
01:04:53,474 --> 01:04:56,456
which in effect was the kiss of death in Memphis Square.

877
01:04:56,757 --> 01:04:59,479
Then the middle of Glen Mall was final nail in the coffin.

878
01:04:59,959 --> 01:05:04,923
And coincidentally, ironically, they went bankrupt, except for Wegmans, bail them out.

879
01:05:05,103 --> 01:05:09,827
The point is, we're repeating, we're not learning from history, in my opinion.

880
01:05:10,387 --> 01:05:11,868
We're repeating the same mistakes.

881
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:14,250
We're not putting it in a central location.

882
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,352
Hopefully you understand my point.

883
01:05:16,432 --> 01:05:16,852
Thank you.

884
01:05:19,156 --> 01:05:21,678
16, 17, 765, offered by Councilor Lockern.

885
01:05:21,698 --> 01:05:27,342
Be it resolved, the building departments update the Memphis City Council with regards to the Rock Pile and Water Street.

886
01:05:27,582 --> 01:05:28,343
Councilor Lockern.

887
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:30,695
Yes, thank you, President Carviello.

888
01:05:30,775 --> 01:05:32,096
I received a few complaints.

889
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:41,599
A lot of the neighborhood around this area has been talking about the rock pile that sits across from the gas station on Winthrop Street.

890
01:05:41,999 --> 01:05:48,341
And I've received two emails from abutters questioning what is going on at the site.

891
01:05:48,501 --> 01:05:55,043
They started work, I believe, started bulldozing, drilling, and blasting on the site September 2016.

892
01:05:57,022 --> 01:06:02,404
This past August in 2017, work has ceased, and now nothing's going on.

893
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:09,307
The neighbors also have a very reasonable concern about the attractiveness of this site to a child.

894
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:12,648
It's a large rock pile, large hole.

895
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:16,850
Children could get hurt, and there's really nothing blocking it off.

896
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:20,372
So if we could get a written response from the building department of

897
01:06:21,652 --> 01:06:40,203
what is going on on that site, what is planned to go on on that site, when will it happen, and in the meantime, if we can somehow, it's an eyesore at this point, but somehow, as best we can, block it off so people do not, especially children, do not go near the site.

898
01:06:40,223 --> 01:06:41,743
I think that's extremely important.

899
01:06:41,783 --> 01:06:47,887
It's something that the neighbors asked me to put on the agenda and see if we can get some answers and a resolve on.

900
01:06:48,984 --> 01:06:50,145
Councilor Del Rosa.

901
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:53,926
I just like the wording of being called a rock pile.

902
01:06:53,946 --> 01:07:00,770
It sounds punitive in nature and it's certainly been punitive towards the neighbors in that area.

903
01:07:01,882 --> 01:07:02,182
Second.

904
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:05,285
On the motion by Councilor Laura Kearns, seconded by Councilor De La Ruza.

905
01:07:05,325 --> 01:07:06,766
All those in favor?

906
01:07:06,866 --> 01:07:07,166
Aye.

907
01:07:07,767 --> 01:07:09,208
Motion passes.

908
01:07:09,228 --> 01:07:23,299
17-676 offered by President Caravaglia be it resolved that the meeting of the City Council on Tuesday, November 7, 2017 be canceled due to the municipal election that will take place on that same day.

909
01:07:23,379 --> 01:07:23,880
Move approval.

910
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,241
If I may before the roll call.

911
01:07:26,582 --> 01:07:27,722
Thank you President Mayako.

912
01:07:28,082 --> 01:07:29,543
We obviously have to cancel this.

913
01:07:30,143 --> 01:07:30,743
Oh geez.

914
01:07:30,864 --> 01:07:31,224
I'm sorry.

915
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:32,024
Thinking about you Bob.

916
01:07:32,044 --> 01:07:34,485
Tuesday November 7th is the election.

917
01:07:34,505 --> 01:07:37,147
The week prior is October 31st.

918
01:07:37,227 --> 01:07:38,187
It's Halloween.

919
01:07:51,173 --> 01:07:55,774
I know I shot an email to everybody and we heard little tweet birds because nobody responded.

920
01:07:55,794 --> 01:07:57,735
I understand it's an important meeting.

921
01:07:58,235 --> 01:08:03,996
It's a Tuesday night before the election, but I just wanted to start a discussion.

922
01:08:04,036 --> 01:08:05,996
I promised my seven-year-old I would ask.

923
01:08:06,077 --> 01:08:08,177
It's my children's favorite holiday.

924
01:08:08,237 --> 01:08:08,937
It's Halloween.

925
01:08:09,477 --> 01:08:15,959
I don't know if it's possible, if anybody would be agreeable to move the meeting to the Monday prior, which would be Monday, October 30th.

926
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:22,581
and even potentially have a second screening on October 31st for those who are planning on watching.

927
01:08:22,601 --> 01:08:24,722
It's just something I want to throw out there.

928
01:08:24,762 --> 01:08:29,724
I obviously will be here if we're going to have a meeting, but October 31st, I have three young children.

929
01:08:29,784 --> 01:08:37,807
I know some others have children as well, maybe a little older, maybe a little younger, and I just think it's something to discuss.

930
01:08:38,727 --> 01:08:39,708
Mr. Clerk, you're set up.

931
01:08:40,188 --> 01:08:43,909
I don't know what location, Monday.

932
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:55,701
Yeah, I guess that's why I'm asking now so maybe we can look into it and people can think about it I don't want to pressure anybody.

933
01:08:55,741 --> 01:09:08,371
I know it's I don't want to pressure anybody, but we can look into it and maybe I Think the city clerk might have some work to do leading up to these elections to if I'm not mistaken Yeah

934
01:09:13,265 --> 01:09:17,487
If the clerk could take a look at that and have a report for next week.

935
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:23,129
And I'll reach out to see if the school committee has a meeting and maybe that would be a potential resolve.

936
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:23,749
Thank you.

937
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:24,249
Thank you.

938
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:27,410
Move approval on your paper.

939
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,271
The motion is seconded by Councilor Felch.

940
01:09:30,311 --> 01:09:31,251
All those in favor?

941
01:09:31,272 --> 01:09:31,332
Aye.

942
01:09:31,452 --> 01:09:32,112
Motion passes.

943
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:51,221
17677 offered by President Caravello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Ed O'Neill, Memphis Chief Assessor, for the past 14 and a half years, and thank him for his dedicated service to the community, and wish him well on his new assignment as the Assessor of the Town of Bonneville.

944
01:09:52,102 --> 01:09:52,642
Move approval.

945
01:09:53,043 --> 01:09:54,704
On the motion by- Mr. President, if I may.

946
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:56,237
Councilor Knight.

947
01:09:57,298 --> 01:10:01,842
I just want to thank Ed O'Neill publicly for the work that he's done for the city of Medford and for me personally.

948
01:10:02,743 --> 01:10:06,808
He's a great guy to give a call and ask some questions to and he always gives you answers.

949
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:11,753
He's always been readily accessible and sometimes referred to as the smartest man in city hall.

950
01:10:12,432 --> 01:10:15,054
So with that being said, Mr. President, I think we're going to feel a void.

951
01:10:15,074 --> 01:10:23,560
He's going to be greatly missed, and I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavor, but I want to thank him for his friendship, his help, and being a mentor to me during my early years on the council.

952
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:32,566
It's been a good man, and it's going to be a big loss to this community, and I hope that the person who replaces him is equal to his talents.

953
01:10:35,508 --> 01:10:36,388
I want to second that.

954
01:10:36,428 --> 01:10:38,169
I think Ed's done a great job.

955
01:10:38,209 --> 01:10:42,371
He's been here quite a while and definitely very knowledgeable.

956
01:10:43,412 --> 01:10:47,214
I wish him good luck in his retirement or new job.

957
01:10:47,314 --> 01:10:48,895
I appreciate all the work he's done.

958
01:10:49,295 --> 01:10:54,638
If we also could maybe get an update on a B paper with regards to when the job will be posted.

959
01:10:54,658 --> 01:10:55,358
It is posted.

960
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:56,159
It's posted, okay.

961
01:10:56,259 --> 01:10:58,640
Because I know two people in the office left over the summer.

962
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,863
Ed left kind of short notice recently and that concerns the entire council, I'm sure.

963
01:11:05,551 --> 01:11:08,098
On the motion by President Cabrera, seconded by Councilor Dela Luzo.

964
01:11:08,118 --> 01:11:08,780
All those in favor?

965
01:11:08,941 --> 01:11:09,362
Aye.

966
01:11:09,402 --> 01:11:10,144
Motion passes.

967
01:11:10,225 --> 01:11:10,886
Motion to take.

968
01:11:11,957 --> 01:11:13,037
Papers in the hands of the clerk.

969
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:13,657
Aye.

970
01:11:14,217 --> 01:11:15,318
Seconded by Councilor Locario.

971
01:11:15,338 --> 01:11:16,098
All those in favor?

972
01:11:16,638 --> 01:11:17,258
Motion passes.

973
01:11:17,558 --> 01:11:23,339
Offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the Eversource project be discussed.

974
01:11:23,459 --> 01:11:24,359
Vice President Mox.

975
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,200
Thank you, Mr. President.

976
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:40,643
This is the fourth time I've offered this resolution, or something similar, to alert residents of this community about the project that Eversource is going to be moving forward with.

977
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:48,408
that's going to be a large undertaking and quite a disruption on our thoroughfares in our community.

978
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:59,357
If people aren't familiar, there is a project that's underway, that's in the process, that is going to be the Mystic-Wubin line project.

979
01:12:00,058 --> 01:12:08,705
And the proposed underground transmission line, which is an electrical line, will connect the Mystic substation in Everett to the Wubin substation.

980
01:12:09,605 --> 01:12:15,807
And from what I understand, it's not going to have any benefit to our community.

981
01:12:15,947 --> 01:12:18,408
However, it's going to be a major disruption.

982
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:29,591
The line will extend approximately eight miles between the two substations passing through Everett, Boston, Somerville, Meffitt, Winchester, and Woburn.

983
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:36,353
The proposed project also includes improvements within the existing fence line of the Mystic and Woburn substations.

984
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:49,739
Eversource has made a commitment to elicit feedback from neighbors, public officials, and stakeholders.

985
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:57,960
And to date, we had one public hearing that this council called for, where representatives from Eversource came forward.

986
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:03,021
And at the time, this was probably a year and a half, two years ago, when we found out about the project.

987
01:13:04,721 --> 01:13:07,182
And I have not heard anything

988
01:13:08,042 --> 01:13:11,103
other than what we've inquired about, Mr. President.

989
01:13:11,764 --> 01:13:22,848
If you go on to the leaflet I got from Eversource, it also mentions the projected schedule, and it said start of construction first quarter 2017.

990
01:13:26,093 --> 01:13:30,997
I'm not a mathematician, but I would think we're past the first quarter in 2017.

991
01:13:32,018 --> 01:13:37,102
And I think, Mr. President, we need to get some answers on this project.

992
01:13:37,683 --> 01:13:43,528
This project will stretch from the Winchester line on Winthrop Street in Method

993
01:13:44,308 --> 01:13:45,609
all the way down Winthrop Street.

994
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:47,811
It'll take a left onto Salt Street.

995
01:13:48,411 --> 01:13:57,878
It'll go down a portion of Main Street in front of the police station and then hang a left onto Mystic Ave and follow Mystic Ave all the way down.

996
01:13:58,839 --> 01:14:10,628
This project also includes manhole installations, trench evacuation, and pipe installation, cable pulling, and pipe fluid filling.

997
01:14:12,816 --> 01:14:21,443
Additionally, the manhole structures deteriorate due to constant traffic resulting in increased noise and vibration to the area.

998
01:14:22,864 --> 01:14:32,451
Manhole installation of 19 precast concrete vaults located underground will be in addition to the trenching they're going to be doing.

999
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:39,676
And each underground vault is going to be eight feet wide by 22 feet long and six feet high.

1000
01:14:40,937 --> 01:14:45,140
And it's going to take roughly 7 to 10 days to install.

1001
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:54,185
And then the trenching will be 100 to 200 feet per day, followed by 10 to 18 days of construction.

1002
01:14:54,925 --> 01:15:06,112
So this is a very lengthy project where residents that are above Winthrop Street, Salt Street, Mystic Ave, may not have access to the driveway for a period of time.

1003
01:15:06,672 --> 01:15:13,294
There's been no communication from what I can see other than what this council is trying to pull out of Eversource.

1004
01:15:13,975 --> 01:15:21,257
Eversource also mentioned that they were going to do a briefing and presentations, email updates.

1005
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:23,498
Anyone on this council get email updates?

1006
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:27,380
So if we're not getting them, you can assure the general public's not getting them.

1007
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,221
They were going to put out door hangers.

1008
01:15:29,961 --> 01:15:31,262
I haven't seen any door hangers.

1009
01:15:31,322 --> 01:15:40,828
I realize construction hasn't started, but the time to do this public outreach is not when construction starts, it's prior to construction.

1010
01:15:42,188 --> 01:15:53,015
They also mentioned that they were going to do direct monitoring to homes along the route, and I have yet to hear anything about that, Mr. President.

1011
01:15:53,896 --> 01:16:06,076
In addition to the disruption that's going to take place on all our streets because of additional traffic They're gonna have to reroute traffic and so forth There's also been discussion about mitigation

1012
01:16:07,215 --> 01:16:23,674
And with any large project, like we saw with the FAST 14 project, when they did the largest building bridge reconstruction in the state's history, there was mitigation done by the contractor with the city of Method.

1013
01:16:24,155 --> 01:16:26,297
I have yet to hear about any mitigation.

1014
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:54,520
How we are going to assist residents of this community and those discussions need to take place and they need to be open and transparent and Residents should have input whether it's power washing a house that may have these vaults You know in front of their homes that are going to be constructed whether it's the trenching that's going on that may have an impact on someone's driveway Whether it's the hours of operation when the project takes place

1015
01:16:55,341 --> 01:16:56,882
None of this is being discussed at all.

1016
01:16:57,303 --> 01:16:59,645
And this is a huge project, Mr. President.

1017
01:17:00,385 --> 01:17:10,194
I get phone calls, reverse 911 calls on a daily basis telling me about the migration of pigeons or something that I don't need to know about.

1018
01:17:11,134 --> 01:17:21,203
But we don't get a call on a project that's going to cut through our city, 2.3 miles of excavation through our city of drenching.

1019
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:30,198
And then there's a whole other issue I brought up, Mr. President, about when they put these particular wires underground.

1020
01:17:31,658 --> 01:17:37,421
They emit transmission, radio emission, not radio, transmission from them.

1021
01:17:38,141 --> 01:17:45,705
And there's been studies done about long and prolonged contact for infants and young children.

1022
01:17:46,466 --> 01:17:48,627
These are the things that have to be discussed and looked at.

1023
01:17:48,647 --> 01:17:52,029
And I'm not sure why we're not discussing this with the president.

1024
01:17:52,049 --> 01:17:54,410
They haven't come before us for a public meeting yet, public hearing yet.

1025
01:17:54,851 --> 01:17:56,432
Well, they did come before.

1026
01:17:56,512 --> 01:17:58,594
I requested a public hearing, which they did come before.

1027
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:00,195
But that was just with the council.

1028
01:18:00,615 --> 01:18:05,779
We need to have an open and notorious process with the general public that can come up and ask questions.

1029
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:08,581
How is this going to impact their routine?

1030
01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:11,443
Is there going to be a disruption in their electrical service?

1031
01:18:11,803 --> 01:18:15,766
Is there going to be a disruption in getting out of their driveway to work or driving their kids to school?

1032
01:18:16,106 --> 01:18:17,227
There's a million issues.

1033
01:18:17,687 --> 01:18:21,290
Where is going to be the platforming where they put their construction equipment?

1034
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:28,862
If they're going to set up shop in the city of Meffitt for 2.3 miles, they're going to want construction areas where they can put their equipment.

1035
01:18:29,303 --> 01:18:32,989
As we heard tonight on Wildwood and Winthrop Street.

1036
01:18:33,069 --> 01:18:34,091
Excuse me, Councilor Maxwell.

1037
01:18:34,111 --> 01:18:35,473
You can leave that door open, please.

1038
01:18:37,863 --> 01:18:47,387
Mr. President, so these are the issues that we've already been confronted with regarding smaller projects, and you can imagine what's going to take place with the larger projects.

1039
01:18:48,227 --> 01:18:51,708
You know, we've gone through this with utility companies.

1040
01:18:52,108 --> 01:18:56,690
When they do trenching, they feel that they don't have to do a curb-to-curb restoration.

1041
01:18:57,693 --> 01:19:02,695
Now, as part of the mitigation, is all the streets that are impacted going to be curb-to-curb?

1042
01:19:03,096 --> 01:19:05,897
Are we going to get new handicap-accessible sidewalks?

1043
01:19:06,197 --> 01:19:07,538
Are we going to get new sidewalks?

1044
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:10,219
These are the things we have to discuss, Mr. President.

1045
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:18,443
And, you know, on Winthrop Street alone, we've all fielded the phone calls regarding the slopes and peaks and valleys in Winthrop Street.

1046
01:19:18,703 --> 01:19:23,486
So when cars go up and down, as we hear, it creates noise for the residents on Winthrop.

1047
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:27,328
Will we be able to mitigate that when this construction's over?

1048
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:37,615
We need to have a serious conversation with the city engineer, the mayor's office, DPW, Eversource, and really start discussing this, Mr. President.

1049
01:19:37,635 --> 01:19:45,921
So I would offer that in a form of a resolution, knowing that their own literature is saying construction is going to start the first quarter of 2017.

1050
01:19:47,302 --> 01:19:53,086
We really need to get ahead of the curve and start discussing these issues on behalf of our residents, Mr. President.

1051
01:19:53,306 --> 01:20:04,050
Mr. Clerk, if you could send a letter to Eversource requesting a meeting so we could have a possible council of the whole meeting with Eversource and a public meeting.

1052
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:16,114
Just to let you know, the Eversource petition for grants of location had been submitted a month ago.

1053
01:20:16,874 --> 01:20:21,376
It's currently in the hands of the city engineer.

1054
01:20:26,962 --> 01:20:37,830
it back to me, that be placed on the agenda for a public hearing, which should be probably, I would think, three to four weeks.

1055
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:39,592
Right.

1056
01:20:39,732 --> 01:20:41,493
And I appreciate all that.

1057
01:20:41,953 --> 01:20:46,056
But what do we tell residents that are calling us up anticipating the work being done?

1058
01:20:46,257 --> 01:20:47,217
This is not a question for you.

1059
01:20:47,738 --> 01:20:55,504
But, Mr. President, what do we tell residents that are calling us up as their elected officials saying, you must be in the know, you must know what's happening,

1060
01:20:56,024 --> 01:20:57,205
And then we have to tell you, you know what?

1061
01:20:57,645 --> 01:20:58,786
We know as much as you do.

1062
01:20:59,227 --> 01:21:00,708
We've been trying to get answers on this.

1063
01:21:01,128 --> 01:21:13,678
And in my opinion, this administration has failed to present any type of cohesive meeting on this so we can get some answers and let the residents know what's going to take place.

1064
01:21:14,278 --> 01:21:16,680
So that's my intent tonight, Mr. President.

1065
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:22,245
Mr. Clerk, if you could contact Eversource, if we can set up a meeting before they come before us.

1066
01:21:24,348 --> 01:21:25,928
Name and address of the record, please.

1067
01:21:26,008 --> 01:21:28,269
Carolyn Jones, 32 Arlington Street.

1068
01:21:30,369 --> 01:21:43,673
I'm just wondering, is it possible that they can just come in and make this deal without the residents of Medford knowing that it's going to take place?

1069
01:21:43,913 --> 01:21:44,073
No.

1070
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,373
It sort of splits Medford up.

1071
01:21:47,114 --> 01:21:51,515
So if there's traffic enough at rush hour and at other times during the day,

1072
01:21:53,752 --> 01:21:56,037
And very often, I have to get on 93.

1073
01:21:58,301 --> 01:22:04,032
But if they're going to have the streets all dug up, how do I get there without going past Tufts?

1074
01:22:04,918 --> 01:22:09,582
There will be a public meeting at some point to discuss that.

1075
01:22:10,943 --> 01:22:16,968
At the moment we don't have a date, but they do come before us before they start any project.

1076
01:22:17,509 --> 01:22:24,294
Okay, I just want to be sure that there's no deal that's been made before the citizens know that a deal's been made.

1077
01:22:24,394 --> 01:22:25,515
Or that it even exists.

1078
01:22:25,575 --> 01:22:28,978
There'll be a public hearing which you'll be able to attend.

1079
01:22:28,998 --> 01:22:29,759
Okay.

1080
01:22:30,059 --> 01:22:30,340
Thank you.

1081
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:32,180
Councilor Knight.

1082
01:22:33,221 --> 01:22:45,785
Mr. President, I'd like to ask that the city engineer before granting the petition for a right of way or before resubmitting it to the city clerk that you take several steps and collect certain information for the City Council.

1083
01:22:45,906 --> 01:22:49,607
I think it's going to be very important that we have this information in our hands when it comes down to make a decision.

1084
01:22:50,307 --> 01:22:52,910
Some of it, it would piggyback on what Councilor Mark said.

1085
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:54,971
Ultimately, a residential mitigation plan's important.

1086
01:22:55,232 --> 01:22:56,332
I think that's something that we need.

1087
01:22:56,673 --> 01:23:04,619
And I think that the city clerk needs to provide, I mean the city engineer needs to provide that with us before she submits back to us the special application for a permit for the grant or right away.

1088
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,083
Also, Mr. President, I think we need to have a comprehensive review of the traffic management plan.

1089
01:23:09,844 --> 01:23:11,665
We have to identify critical path items.

1090
01:23:11,685 --> 01:23:14,087
If we're thinking about this project, it's gonna come right past this high school.

1091
01:23:14,728 --> 01:23:15,329
Right past this high school.

1092
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:16,570
It's gonna go right in front of our police station.

1093
01:23:17,278 --> 01:23:17,698
You know what I mean?

1094
01:23:17,758 --> 01:23:21,021
Our police and fire headquarters, we're going to have construction in front of them for an extended period of time.

1095
01:23:21,322 --> 01:23:31,511
And then when the construction's over, they're going to tell us they're going to come back in a year, and they're going to retrench and repave to bring it back to city of Medford standards, which we haven't seen happen from these public utility companies.

1096
01:23:32,071 --> 01:23:35,414
And lastly, Mr. President, I think we need a clear and concise schedule with dates.

1097
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:39,598
Dates of when shovels are going to be in the ground, dates when we can anticipate that this work's going to take place.

1098
01:23:39,918 --> 01:23:42,641
So I think Councilman Marks put together a great resolution on this issue.

1099
01:23:43,141 --> 01:23:51,710
I'd like to amend the paper and ask that the city clerk express to the city engineer that we need, number one, a clear and concise plan and schedule with dates.

1100
01:23:53,071 --> 01:23:56,675
We need to identify the critical path items that are going to affect the operation of day-to-day government.

1101
01:23:58,457 --> 01:24:00,999
We need a traffic management plan that needs to be reviewed.

1102
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:04,612
And we also need a residential mitigation plan, Mr. President.

1103
01:24:04,632 --> 01:24:16,484
I think those are four key items that would make a big difference in helping move this project along, helping inform residents in the community what's going on, and helping us maintain a strong quality of life while it's going on.

1104
01:24:16,924 --> 01:24:23,490
Ultimately, when you think about where the project's going, Winthrop Street, the residents on Winthrop Street dealt with two years of a drainage project.

1105
01:24:24,271 --> 01:24:32,936
Then the day the drainage project was over, we got a letter from MassDOT saying that they were going to do 135, not even 130 feet of bridge, and it was going to take three years down to Medford Square.

1106
01:24:33,336 --> 01:24:38,580
And the traffic management plan was to revert all the traffic right back up Winthrop Street on the new street that just got fixed.

1107
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:45,484
And now, when that project's over, we're going to see Eversource come in, and they're going to put their shovels in the ground, and they're going to tear that road up again, Mr. President.

1108
01:24:45,504 --> 01:24:48,005
The residents in that area and that neighborhood have faced a lot.

1109
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:51,447
And it's not something that's happened for two years or three years or four years.

1110
01:24:51,487 --> 01:24:52,528
Now we're looking on a half a decade.

1111
01:24:53,827 --> 01:25:03,997
So I'd ask that these matters be added to the paper as a B paper as an amendment, Mr. President, sent to the city engineer and forwarded to us prior to her submitting the application for the permit for the grants right away.

1112
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:04,920
Councilor Lococo.

1113
01:25:05,281 --> 01:25:06,882
Thank you, President Carvalho.

1114
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:11,905
I wanna thank Councilor Marks, and I agree with him wholeheartedly, and I also agree with Councilor Knight.

1115
01:25:12,445 --> 01:25:16,428
I just see if we could amend this as well to include the city solicitor.

1116
01:25:17,428 --> 01:25:32,038
Residents on South Street have been advocating for, obviously, reduced speed, reduced heavy trucking and speed, and they have a number of concerns and a whole checklist of things that they want done on South Street, and that will be the case for every street that Eversource is gonna dig up.

1117
01:25:32,758 --> 01:25:40,486
And when we looked into it, we found out through the mayor's office that the city solicitor will be negotiating the contract with Evisource.

1118
01:25:40,546 --> 01:25:46,853
So I think he needs to be involved and I think the residents need to be involved as well before the contract is finalized.

1119
01:25:47,233 --> 01:25:51,998
There's no better person than a resident who lives on a road that can tell you

1120
01:25:52,662 --> 01:26:01,889
what should be in that contract as far as before it's dug up, while it's being dug up, and what needs to be done when it's going to be permanently reinstalled.

1121
01:26:02,309 --> 01:26:04,691
So I'm glad this is put forth.

1122
01:26:04,731 --> 01:26:09,275
I'd like to add that the solicitor be involved in this meeting that is going to hopefully take place.

1123
01:26:09,735 --> 01:26:10,916
And I agree with Councilor Marks.

1124
01:26:11,136 --> 01:26:13,558
People come to us all the time asking for answers.

1125
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,701
when we can't give them, it's just a sad day.

1126
01:26:16,721 --> 01:26:21,103
And we should be more informed and Eversource should be on the forefront.

1127
01:26:21,143 --> 01:26:32,707
And this city administration should be in the forefront of educating the public and the city council so that everybody knows what's going on, when it's going to take place, how it's going to take place, and for residents and the city council to give input.

1128
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:34,828
So I second the resolve.

1129
01:26:37,556 --> 01:26:41,941
On the motion by Councilor Mox, as amended by Councilor Knight and Councilor Locario.

1130
01:26:41,961 --> 01:26:43,303
All those in favor?

1131
01:26:43,383 --> 01:26:43,924
Roll call vote.

1132
01:26:43,964 --> 01:26:45,666
Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

1133
01:26:45,946 --> 01:26:46,627
Please call the roll.

1134
01:26:58,898 --> 01:27:21,712
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

1135
01:27:23,213 --> 01:27:24,194
Thank you, Mr. President.

1136
01:27:24,354 --> 01:27:30,416
I made a commitment back, that's actually three years now, that I wasn't going to let this issue die.

1137
01:27:31,136 --> 01:27:33,077
And I'm moving forward with my commitment.

1138
01:27:33,718 --> 01:27:43,962
We were promised back three and a half years ago by then Mayor McGlynn that there was going to be a pilot program in this city to implement three raised crosswalks.

1139
01:27:44,782 --> 01:27:54,549
And the mayor did his homework and research and decided that Harvard Street, Central Ave, and Winthrop Street were going to be the pilot locations.

1140
01:27:56,270 --> 01:28:00,272
To date, we have only installed one, Mr. President, on Winthrop Street.

1141
01:28:01,073 --> 01:28:13,181
The other two raised crosswalks, I have offered several, actually countless resolutions to this administration on an update on when we're going to see these other two raised crosswalks.

1142
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:21,043
Not just because I want to see a raised crosswalk, because it's a proven way, Mr. President, for traffic calming.

1143
01:28:21,623 --> 01:28:23,363
And it's done in many other communities.

1144
01:28:23,703 --> 01:28:24,884
It's not a speed bump.

1145
01:28:25,204 --> 01:28:26,484
It's a raised crosswalk.

1146
01:28:27,604 --> 01:28:41,188
It slows down traffic, which is probably one of the top concerns I get from residents in this community, speeding cars and the fact that it's very difficult for a pedestrian to get around this community.

1147
01:28:43,248 --> 01:29:03,802
You know with all these different projects going on as I stated earlier It's great to do complete streets and look at bump outs in some other areas But we also have to attend to things that we've already approved and already decided are going to get done whether it's filling a pothole whether it's uh doing thermoplastic on a crosswalk or

1148
01:29:04,382 --> 01:29:10,246
completing the other two raised crosswalks that we discussed three and a half years ago.

1149
01:29:10,687 --> 01:29:24,117
I realize it's a different administration, but if this administration doesn't want to honor what Mayor McGlynn put forward three and a half years ago in that pilot project, then the administration should come out and say, I don't want to honor it.

1150
01:29:24,477 --> 01:29:26,958
And then I'll know where I stand with the issue, Mr. President.

1151
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:29,319
I'll still fight for it, but I'll know where I stand.

1152
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:35,441
But we have yet to get an answer that at least satisfies me where we stand on the other two raised crosswalks.

1153
01:29:35,842 --> 01:29:44,465
And residents on Central Ave and on Harvard Street deserve to know, Mr. President, because they were all wondering, where are these crosswalks?

1154
01:29:44,745 --> 01:29:48,287
They were originally told, well, we got to wait for the construction on Harvard to stop.

1155
01:29:48,587 --> 01:29:52,469
Central Ave, they would talk, well, we got to — there's some other things pending right now.

1156
01:29:52,709 --> 01:29:55,530
We're going to start with the crosswalk in front of the park.

1157
01:29:56,231 --> 01:29:58,492
And I have yet to see anything, Mr. President.

1158
01:29:58,872 --> 01:30:07,917
So I would put that — again, you know, the mayor is going to get sick of seeing this every several weeks, but maybe the squeaky wheel will get the oil in this case.

1159
01:30:08,597 --> 01:30:12,979
And we'll get raised crosswalks for pedestrian safety, Mr. President.

1160
01:30:14,344 --> 01:30:14,885
Councilor Knight.

1161
01:30:15,185 --> 01:30:23,517
I'd also like to add a B paper to this, Mr. President, and ask the DPW commissioner to provide us with a report listing the pros and the cons of the use of race crosswalks.

1162
01:30:23,558 --> 01:30:29,046
Maybe we're missing something here because I think it's something that the council supported in the past, but it's really not moving forward.

1163
01:30:29,606 --> 01:30:31,488
And maybe there's a reason why that we don't know about.

1164
01:30:31,588 --> 01:30:33,409
So like Councilman Mox said, we'll know where we stand.

1165
01:30:33,569 --> 01:30:40,154
Why don't we have the DPW commissioner send us a list of the pros and the cons, what's good about it and what they see is bad, and then why it hasn't been implemented.

1166
01:30:40,174 --> 01:30:41,495
But I think that we're on the right track.

1167
01:30:42,195 --> 01:30:47,920
Race crosswalks, anything that could be used to improve pedestrian safety in this community is necessary, Mr. President.

1168
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:51,482
Every week we hear the same old stories, traffic, crosswalks.

1169
01:30:52,943 --> 01:30:54,344
On the motion by Vice President Mox.

1170
01:30:56,615 --> 01:30:59,858
Mr. President, I don't mind the B paper.

1171
01:31:00,818 --> 01:31:01,679
We can look into that.

1172
01:31:01,759 --> 01:31:08,665
But when you're talking about a raised crosswalk, there is study after study if you go on to the Internet.

1173
01:31:09,105 --> 01:31:21,715
And all you need to do is look at Cambridge, look at Somerville, look at Arlington, look at every surrounding community that uses raised crosswalks for pedestrian safety and also to slow down speeding traffic.

1174
01:31:22,035 --> 01:31:22,716
Mr. President.

1175
01:31:23,456 --> 01:31:32,144
You know, when you look at other communities that are using thermoplastic or doing bump-outs or extending the curbs to slow down traffic, this is not a secret.

1176
01:31:32,545 --> 01:31:33,906
It's being done everywhere else.

1177
01:31:34,386 --> 01:31:37,710
And the fact that we're not doing it, I don't think it means there's

1178
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:44,134
Cons, I think it's a lack of the administration to get something done, to be quite frank with you.

1179
01:31:44,554 --> 01:31:48,797
And a lot of the stuff that I'm seeing is window dressing, saying, hey, look what we're doing.

1180
01:31:49,217 --> 01:31:52,739
But we're not taking care of the very important issues, Mr. President.

1181
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:54,720
And I don't mind that as a B paper.

1182
01:31:55,521 --> 01:32:00,164
But clearly, this has been on the table for three and a half years now.

1183
01:32:00,604 --> 01:32:04,827
And to go back and look at the city come back and say what the pros and cons are.

1184
01:32:05,467 --> 01:32:09,808
I think the host is already out of the bond on this, to be quite honest with you.

1185
01:32:10,568 --> 01:32:11,308
Councilor Knight.

1186
01:32:11,688 --> 01:32:21,690
The reason I say let's get the pros and cons is so that if there are cons on the list that maybe we can do some research and refute them and drive a better bargain to make a more convincing argument.

1187
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:24,310
They're saying, no, this is why we don't want to do it.

1188
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:29,491
Well, let's find out the reasons why, look at them, and see if we can come up with reasons why we should.

1189
01:32:29,771 --> 01:32:32,652
And some kind of counterargument, Mr. President, was all I was saying.

1190
01:32:32,672 --> 01:32:33,672
But I think it's a great resolution.

1191
01:32:33,712 --> 01:32:34,532
I'll support it wholeheartedly.

1192
01:32:34,892 --> 01:32:36,152
So if I could, Mr. President.

1193
01:32:36,733 --> 01:32:37,493
Mr. Vice President.

1194
01:32:37,533 --> 01:32:38,933
Councilor Knight brings up a valid point.

1195
01:32:39,774 --> 01:32:47,716
If this is a pilot program, I would assume you create a pilot program to, when you're done with the pilot program, you say, was this a success?

1196
01:32:48,237 --> 01:32:49,357
Should we implement more?

1197
01:32:49,837 --> 01:32:51,578
What should we do to improve this?

1198
01:32:52,318 --> 01:32:57,140
And I have yet to hear any discussion with the Winter Street raised crosswalk.

1199
01:32:57,580 --> 01:33:00,461
So I think if we sit here and wait for the city to react,

1200
01:33:01,321 --> 01:33:03,583
We'll hold our breath till we turn blue in the face.

1201
01:33:04,163 --> 01:33:05,664
Clearly, the city's not going to react.

1202
01:33:06,244 --> 01:33:16,051
And, you know, I think it's time that we as a council push for the things that we want to see happen and not give them a way out saying, well, what are the pros and cons?

1203
01:33:16,131 --> 01:33:19,653
I mean, the pilot program has been in existence for three and a half years now.

1204
01:33:20,373 --> 01:33:23,936
If the city hasn't figured out the pros and cons yet, they never will, Mr. President.

1205
01:33:24,736 --> 01:33:25,577
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1206
01:33:26,658 --> 01:33:27,118
Move approval.

1207
01:33:27,459 --> 01:33:30,560
On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by?

1208
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:30,640
Aye.

1209
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:33,362
Councilor Lococo and all those in favor?

1210
01:33:33,722 --> 01:33:34,083
Aye.

1211
01:33:34,263 --> 01:33:35,203
Motion passes.

1212
01:33:35,603 --> 01:33:41,947
Offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the safety of our traffic supervisor and residents be discussed.

1213
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:43,348
Vice President Mox.

1214
01:33:43,388 --> 01:33:44,309
Thank you, Mr. President.

1215
01:33:44,329 --> 01:33:45,730
It's actually traffic supervisors.

1216
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:47,110
I might have misprinted it.

1217
01:33:50,333 --> 01:34:01,357
Mr. President, today, as we saw on the news, first of all, the Memphis Police de-escalated a very potential explosive situation at the Columbus School.

1218
01:34:02,058 --> 01:34:12,682
And I just want to praise the Memphis Police Department for their response and how they handled the situation at the Columbus School, as well as the faculty and principal and so forth.

1219
01:34:13,242 --> 01:34:20,444
Also, Mr. President, today — and this is an issue near and dear to me for a number of years — our traffic supervisors.

1220
01:34:21,425 --> 01:34:25,706
And, you know, they're the ones, Mr. President, that you never hear anything about.

1221
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:28,407
They have a tiny union in the city.

1222
01:34:28,727 --> 01:34:30,008
They never ask for anything.

1223
01:34:30,468 --> 01:34:35,269
But they handle our most precious item every day — our children.

1224
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:39,811
Every day, they cross our children on these busy, busy roads.

1225
01:34:40,739 --> 01:34:43,901
on these busy, busy federal affairs, and you never hear anything.

1226
01:34:44,202 --> 01:34:48,084
Today, there was an incident where one of them was struck in West Meffitt, Mr. President.

1227
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:59,272
And I hope everything works well with that particular traffic supervisor, and my thoughts and prayers go out to the traffic supervisor.

1228
01:34:59,773 --> 01:35:03,776
But for a number of years, Mr. President, I've been talking about this issue.

1229
01:35:04,776 --> 01:35:16,383
And not just because, you know, I want to talk about it, it's because I heard directly from the traffic supervisors that they need a way to communicate to the police department.

1230
01:35:16,984 --> 01:35:29,031
So when they're on a thoroughfare, just say High Street or Winthrop Street or one of the major roads, Riverside Ave, Salem Street, and a car is driving by very aggressively and doesn't stop far.

1231
01:35:29,871 --> 01:35:36,176
or poses a threat, they really have no means of communicating directly to the police department.

1232
01:35:36,537 --> 01:35:38,118
They're the eyes and ears on the street.

1233
01:35:39,018 --> 01:35:40,980
And we have a number of them throughout the community.

1234
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:51,468
Why not take that information and be able to use that information to possibly send out a message to these people that refuse to stop for a traffic supervisor?

1235
01:35:51,768 --> 01:35:53,650
Someone that's wearing a multicolored vest.

1236
01:35:54,090 --> 01:36:00,660
that's in a crosswalk with signs and children and they refuse to stop at a crosswalk, Mr. President.

1237
01:36:01,562 --> 01:36:08,712
I proposed an idea, I think it was two years ago, that they receive just small little walkie-talkies, maybe even the

1238
01:36:09,554 --> 01:36:14,299
second ones that are discarded after the police get the new walkie-talkies, our police department.

1239
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:27,773
That way they can have direct communication and be able to call in a license plate or be able to say, hey, there was just a red Mercedes that ran through and almost created a catastrophe here at this particular location.

1240
01:36:27,973 --> 01:36:28,874
Can you be on the lookout?

1241
01:36:29,535 --> 01:36:33,216
These type of things would be very, very helpful, Mr. President.

1242
01:36:33,757 --> 01:36:44,021
And I'm not sure why, as a community, we're not being a little more aggressive when it comes to creating a safer environment.

1243
01:36:44,781 --> 01:36:54,905
The second issue, Mr. President, and I talked about this earlier, is many of our crosswalks that have the traffic supervisors that are crossing our kids aren't clearly marked.

1244
01:36:55,425 --> 01:36:56,225
They're not painted.

1245
01:36:56,605 --> 01:36:57,526
There's no signage.

1246
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:04,487
So we're putting a traffic supervisor and our kids in a very unsafe predicament out there.

1247
01:37:04,547 --> 01:37:15,419
So when I talked earlier about the need to repaint our crosswalks, it wasn't just to bring it up again, it's because of issues like we saw today, Mr. President.

1248
01:37:15,759 --> 01:37:20,064
And that may not prevent something from happening, but it will surely help

1249
01:37:20,484 --> 01:37:22,965
when the crosswalk is clearly marked.

1250
01:37:23,265 --> 01:37:38,772
It'll surely help when a car coming up can see from a distance that that's a crosswalk, can see the neon signs and saying people are crossing, maybe even blinking signs that Councilor Longo has been talking about installing throughout the community.

1251
01:37:39,432 --> 01:37:49,458
But clearly, Mr. President, there's a need to integrate a communication process with traffic supervisors as our eyes and ears, Mr. President.

1252
01:37:49,738 --> 01:37:55,542
There's clearly a need to revisit what's happening with crosswalks throughout the city.

1253
01:37:56,542 --> 01:38:03,065
that they're not safe for our students and our traffic supervisors and residents that are crossing.

1254
01:38:03,546 --> 01:38:16,552
And clearly what I'd like to see done, Mr. President, is some type of sting where we have police that are around the corner waiting to see during the course of a day what happens when people go through.

1255
01:38:17,112 --> 01:38:20,954
I mean, I hear from traffic supervisors that people will flip the bird.

1256
01:38:21,754 --> 01:38:25,557
You know, they yell out the window, how dare you stop traffic.

1257
01:38:25,997 --> 01:38:32,142
I mean, you have to see the abuse that the traffic supervisors are putting up with kids across the street.

1258
01:38:32,823 --> 01:38:34,624
And there's no need for it, Mr. President.

1259
01:38:34,864 --> 01:38:36,766
And we as a community have to send a message out.

1260
01:38:37,146 --> 01:38:38,928
It's not going to be tolerated in our community.

1261
01:38:39,428 --> 01:38:47,115
I realize people get frustrated sitting in traffic and so forth, but when it comes to public safety, we're not going to take a back seat in this community.

1262
01:38:47,515 --> 01:39:03,610
So I would ask, Mr. President, that the Chief Sacco revisit the direct communication with our traffic supervisors so they can report things on a timely manner, also that we revisit our crosswalks

1263
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:29,397
to make sure that they're highly visible and the correct signage and painting is done properly, Mr. President, and that the Memphis police do a sting in certain locations to send out a message in this community that we're not going to tolerate abuse of our traffic supervisors or cars speeding through intersections where our children and our pedestrians are crossing, Mr. President.

1264
01:39:29,757 --> 01:39:30,838
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1265
01:39:30,858 --> 01:39:31,078
Thank you.

1266
01:39:32,304 --> 01:39:32,845
Move approved.

1267
01:39:33,407 --> 01:39:35,170
On the motion by Vice President Mox.

1268
01:39:35,491 --> 01:39:35,872
Seconded.

1269
01:39:36,072 --> 01:39:37,315
Seconded by Councilor Allend.

1270
01:39:37,756 --> 01:39:38,357
All those in favor.

1271
01:39:38,417 --> 01:39:39,639
Roll call vote Mr. President.

1272
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:42,185
Mr. Clerk roll call vote has been requested.

1273
01:39:51,604 --> 01:40:10,616
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

1274
01:40:11,256 --> 01:40:12,357
involved in the accident today.

1275
01:40:12,377 --> 01:40:16,280
I don't know, for those of you who don't know, there was a crossing guy to West Mephitt.

1276
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:18,742
He didn't get hit by a car, but he got hit by a backhoe.

1277
01:40:19,803 --> 01:40:34,574
And I say, you know, if you could, maybe when you get back to the office tomorrow, find out what his status is in West Mephitt, at the train, at the place that in High Street this afternoon.

1278
01:40:34,614 --> 01:40:38,157
So, again, I hope the young lady is okay.

1279
01:40:39,002 --> 01:41:00,032
Offered by Councilor Langlois-Carrion be it resolved that the council receive a copy of the updated data that was requested by the school committee last night as it relates to adding developments of 100 or more and including all non-school age children within the study of lower developments are affecting our schools.

1280
01:41:00,112 --> 01:41:00,892
Councilor Langlois-Carrion.

1281
01:41:01,653 --> 01:41:03,273
Thank you, President Carviello.

1282
01:41:03,353 --> 01:41:06,235
I was watching the school committee meeting last night.

1283
01:41:06,965 --> 01:41:10,206
a group of teachers were going to speak, and I wanted to take a look.

1284
01:41:11,007 --> 01:41:34,877
And before that happened, School Committee woman Erin DeBettidetto had brought up the issue with regards to just the research that took place, data that was collected of children from developments entering, and how many are entering Medford Public Schools, and I think it's just something we need to keep track of, especially since we're developing all over the community.

1285
01:41:35,610 --> 01:41:45,515
She asked for a further report with regards to including developments with 100 or more versus the 150 or more that was done in the last round of data.

1286
01:41:45,895 --> 01:41:52,858
She also asked for school-age children and non-school-age children so we can get an idea of what will

1287
01:41:53,411 --> 01:41:58,032
the amount of children that will be entering our schools coming down the line so that we can plan accordingly.

1288
01:41:58,412 --> 01:42:10,435
I think it was a great resolve, it was supported unanimously, and I would just like, once that is drafted and complete, I would like to get a copy so that we can conclude it with the data that we received two weeks ago.

1289
01:42:10,455 --> 01:42:11,035
Thank you.

1290
01:42:11,055 --> 01:42:19,817
And I think it's just one of the, like again, one of the many parts that we need to look into with regards to development and how it's affecting our community.

1291
01:42:20,037 --> 01:42:20,297
Thank you.

1292
01:42:21,304 --> 01:42:24,365
on the motion by Councilor Kern, seconded by Councilor Russo.

1293
01:42:24,385 --> 01:42:24,945
All those in favor.

1294
01:42:25,365 --> 01:42:27,766
I motion passes records.

1295
01:42:28,506 --> 01:42:34,587
Mr. President, Vice President Max, before you call for the records, I just want to bring to the council's attention.

1296
01:42:35,387 --> 01:42:38,928
We got responses back from the mayor in our packet.

1297
01:42:40,188 --> 01:42:42,909
One was for paper 17 dash six, three, seven.

1298
01:42:43,489 --> 01:42:50,631
It was an update offered by myself and Council Longo Kern for the future and current plans for the Hagner Center.

1299
01:42:51,471 --> 01:42:58,377
I believe Councilor Longo and I have put this on the agenda, along with other members of the Council, three times at least.

1300
01:42:59,078 --> 01:43:11,028
And the response we received on this latest was, as stated on the Council paper June 13th, which is one of the other responses, we will apprise the Council of the needs once an evaluation is completed.

1301
01:43:12,187 --> 01:43:21,595
So clearly, Mr. President, the city has at least no intent right now to do anything with that particular building.

1302
01:43:22,235 --> 01:43:32,904
We know the city's track record when it comes to the maintenance of buildings, and the lung of this particular building remains vacant.

1303
01:43:33,765 --> 01:43:42,712
and unkept, Mr. President, the more it's going to cost this community and taxpayers to eventually fix it for another repurpose.

1304
01:43:43,532 --> 01:43:55,741
And I know I, as one member, have put out looking at potential, which I think Councilor Scarpelli would agree upon, potential location for new athletic

1305
01:43:57,262 --> 01:44:04,729
recreation department or a potential use for an art center, Mr. President, in this community.

1306
01:44:05,069 --> 01:44:11,394
Right now, we don't have a home for Meffitt Arts, and that building would be of tremendous use.

1307
01:44:11,474 --> 01:44:15,838
So I would ask that we get a better response, Mr. President.

1308
01:44:16,339 --> 01:44:20,402
And if the mayor doesn't have any idea what she wants to do with the building,

1309
01:44:22,064 --> 01:44:22,925
Let me retract that.

1310
01:44:23,766 --> 01:44:36,679
Originally, when the company that was renting this particular building wanted to sell the building after the city turning the building over for $1,

1311
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:45,851
for their use to provide support for people with disabilities.

1312
01:44:46,633 --> 01:44:52,401
And according to the city, if it was no longer to be used for that purpose, it would revert back to the city.

1313
01:44:53,142 --> 01:44:59,083
So this particular company, not-for-profit, was no longer moving.

1314
01:44:59,343 --> 01:44:59,984
They moved out.

1315
01:45:00,404 --> 01:45:01,804
They were no longer using the building.

1316
01:45:02,144 --> 01:45:03,024
They tried to sell it.

1317
01:45:03,044 --> 01:45:04,905
It was this councilor who made that proposal?

1318
01:45:04,945 --> 01:45:13,007
They tried to sell it for over, I think it was $650,000, a building the city gave to them for $1 for a particular purpose.

1319
01:45:13,427 --> 01:45:20,748
The mayor came and said she negotiated an agreement that would give the city, I think, don't quote me on this, but I think it was about $100,000.

1320
01:45:23,169 --> 01:45:32,853
And it was this council, and I led the charge, Mr. President, that stopped it from happening, Mr. President, and requested the city solicitor look into taking that building back.

1321
01:45:33,453 --> 01:45:38,775
And the city solicitor reached out to the entity, and we were able to secure the building.

1322
01:45:39,075 --> 01:45:44,537
But now it's been close to a year, and we've been asking, what are we going to do with the building, Mr. President?

1323
01:45:45,158 --> 01:45:48,079
And we still have no answers from this administration.

1324
01:45:48,739 --> 01:45:58,436
So I would again ask that we get a response on behalf of the residents of this community and the direct abutters that want to know what's going on, Mr. President.

1325
01:45:59,019 --> 01:45:59,979
Thank you Mr. Vice President.

1326
01:46:00,059 --> 01:46:02,800
On the motion by Vice President Mox.

1327
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,421
Second by Council Member Kern.

1328
01:46:05,601 --> 01:46:07,161
Thank you President Carviello.

1329
01:46:07,261 --> 01:46:18,105
I agree with my colleague and I just want to go further and ask for what type of evaluation is being done and how long are we expecting for it to be complete?

1330
01:46:18,505 --> 01:46:24,947
Because we have been asking for answers for a year and I think it's time that we get a little more than half a sentence.

1331
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:29,439
because we're not asking, I don't live, I'm not a direct abutter.

1332
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:34,401
The direct abutters are emailing and calling us to find out what is going on with the property.

1333
01:46:34,822 --> 01:46:38,283
Once in a while, they'll see a couple shrubs tidied up.

1334
01:46:38,583 --> 01:46:40,364
Once in a while, they'll see some activity.

1335
01:46:40,424 --> 01:46:42,185
I believe our police department's using it.

1336
01:46:42,605 --> 01:46:47,107
But what evaluation's being done, how long is it gonna take, and what's our plan?

1337
01:46:47,807 --> 01:46:48,707
It's time, it's time.

1338
01:46:48,948 --> 01:46:54,590
If we need to, whatever we need to do to get some answers in more than a half sentence, it would be much appreciated.

1339
01:46:55,369 --> 01:46:55,729
Thank you.

1340
01:46:55,789 --> 01:46:57,590
On the motion by Vice President Mox.

1341
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:58,911
Mr. President, if I could.

1342
01:46:58,931 --> 01:46:59,391
Yes.

1343
01:46:59,691 --> 01:47:24,824
Not to belabor the point, but any any time the administration talks about an evaluation or a study, it just brings back some real bad thoughts in my head about the study that was commissioned to look at a taxi on a water taxi on the Mystic River or a study on whether or not we needed a parking garage behind Colleen's, Mr. President.

1344
01:47:25,304 --> 01:47:29,407
Hundreds of thousands of dollars spent to realize something that we already know.

1345
01:47:30,067 --> 01:47:36,291
So I hope that the city's not going to move forward with some type of study on this, Mr. President.

1346
01:47:36,631 --> 01:47:43,175
Because all we need to do is get the wealth of knowledge we have in this community and move forward on a need that we have in this community.

1347
01:47:43,655 --> 01:47:44,616
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1348
01:47:45,316 --> 01:47:48,438
On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor McCarran.

1349
01:47:49,243 --> 01:47:49,783
All those in favor?

1350
01:47:49,984 --> 01:47:50,284
Aye.

1351
01:47:50,564 --> 01:47:51,344
Motion passes.

1352
01:47:51,885 --> 01:47:57,008
The table records of the meeting of September 19th are passed to Councilor Scott Peli.

1353
01:47:57,348 --> 01:47:59,549
Councilor Scott Peli, how did you find those records?

1354
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:02,912
Please forgive me if I could extend that to next week.

1355
01:48:02,992 --> 01:48:03,932
I'd appreciate it.

1356
01:48:04,633 --> 01:48:07,735
If we could table those records another week for Councilor Scott Peli.

1357
01:48:08,643 --> 01:48:14,726
The records of the meeting of September 26th, 2017 were passed to Councilor DelaRusso.

1358
01:48:15,006 --> 01:48:16,887
Councilor DelaRusso, how have you found those records?

1359
01:48:17,027 --> 01:48:23,070
Mr. President, after examining the records to the best of my ability, I see them to be without error and move their approval.

1360
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:24,331
Thank you.

1361
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:26,472
All those in favor of accepting the record?

1362
01:48:26,492 --> 01:48:26,932
Mr. President?

1363
01:48:27,412 --> 01:48:28,313
Mr. Vice President?

1364
01:48:28,433 --> 01:48:34,576
Just before we end, I think you let us know that next week we may be back at City Hall.

1365
01:48:34,636 --> 01:48:36,957
We will be back at City Hall next week for everyone.

1366
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,791
so people know not to come up to the high school.

1367
01:48:40,811 --> 01:48:41,892
We want people to come up here.

1368
01:48:42,293 --> 01:48:48,777
Maybe Barry might make a call, let everybody know that we're back at City Hall, our regular home.

1369
01:48:48,897 --> 01:48:50,639
I would ask that in the form of a motion then.

1370
01:48:50,659 --> 01:48:59,485
Mr. Clerk, if you could ask the administration if we can get a call letting people know that we will be back at City Hall next week.

1371
01:48:59,605 --> 01:49:01,086
Thank you, Mr. President.

1372
01:49:01,126 --> 01:49:03,528
Motion to adjourn by Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

1373
01:49:03,568 --> 01:49:04,449
Motion to adjourn.

1374
01:49:06,391 --> 01:49:07,153
All those in favor?

1375
01:49:07,293 --> 01:49:07,454
Aye.

1376
01:49:07,715 --> 01:49:08,858
Motion passes.

1377
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:10,202
