1
00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:01,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Matt Leming here.

2
00:00:02,712 --> 00:00:08,314
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first video slash blog post that I'm doing post-election.

3
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:18,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just had a local election in which ballot questions six, seven, and eight were on the ballot.

4
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:21,098
[SPEAKER_00]: To recap, this was a question to

5
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:26,000
[SPEAKER_00]: fund the building of a new fire headquarters, which is question six.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:41,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Question seven was to put three million dollars towards the Medford public school system to level fund it, and five hundred thousand dollars to the Department of Public Works to let them hire a permanent road repair crew.

7
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:50,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And question eight was to put an additional four million dollars towards the Medford public school system to invest in things like arts and vocational programs and additional money for

8
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:59,319
[SPEAKER_00]: teacher salaries, basically things to keep it competitive and improve and invest in the future of the Medford public school system.

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,703
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results of the elections came in.

10
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:07,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions 7 and 8 passed and question 6 failed.

11
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:08,889
[SPEAKER_00]: The margins were pretty narrow.

12
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:21,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So question 7 passed with, this is the unofficial tally, it's not the official certified tally, but with the unofficial tally it was 14,847 for and 13,304 votes against.

13
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:29,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Question 8 passed with 14,664 and 13,518 against.

14
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And question 6 failed with 13,458 for and 13,965 against.

15
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:37,096
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ballot questions 7 and 8 passed with about 52% of the vote and question 6 failed about 49 to 51.

16
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:01,950
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously I would have liked to see question 6 pass.

17
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:13,018
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that the leadership of the firefighter union came out against it was most certainly what killed it.

18
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:29,852
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there was probably a corpus of about a thousand voters or so who supported the ballot measures level funding the schools, but decided to go with the leadership of the fire union and kill the

19
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:32,078
[SPEAKER_00]: funding for the fire headquarters.

20
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:37,122
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really sure what the future of that project will be.

21
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:49,613
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that personally, I think that the next ballot, the next debt exclusion that we'll need to see is about is going to be for the new high school.

22
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:51,174
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coming.

23
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:53,936
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coming in the future, probably in the next couple of years.

24
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:58,300
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really going to need to be the priority.

25
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,821
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very expensive project.

26
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:10,466
[SPEAKER_00]: The Massachusetts School Building Authority will likely put a good chunk of funding for it, but the remainder will need to be paid for by the city.

27
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:16,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that you do that is with a debt exclusion.

28
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:25,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So these results are pretty unusual, just in the sense that typically it's overrides that fail.

29
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:41,963
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I did a lot of combing through the data, combing through the previous override votes that have gone through different municipalities since 1980.

30
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:56,414
[SPEAKER_00]: They have about a 41% passage rate overall, and during presidential election years, in the November general election, they have about a 35% passage rate.

31
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:59,998
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was pretty unusual, all things considered.

32
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:04,023
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really stacked against it, especially since this is Medford's first time having an override.

33
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:10,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Debt exclusions actually have closer to an 89% passage rate.

34
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:13,729
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's interesting, I don't actually know why that is.

35
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:27,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's because when voters are looking at something on the ballot, like a building is something that you can physically imagine is going to be there, and debt exclusions are also temporary, so that's slightly more appealing.

36
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, whereas with

37
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:41,933
[SPEAKER_00]: overrides, you know, when you're talking about things like teacher, teacher salaries, staff salaries, operating budgets, it's less tangible, it's something people can't really see.

38
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:54,142
[SPEAKER_00]: We were getting a lot of people commenting saying, you know, oh, you should be able to balance the budget, you should be able to, you know, work creatively with less, things like that.

39
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:59,146
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really something that we can't, you can do after a certain point.

40
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:00,247
[SPEAKER_00]: If a budget's just

41
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:09,464
[SPEAKER_00]: shrinking and shrinking over time, especially when it's as small as Medford's, that's something that's really not feasible after a while.

42
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:29,353
[SPEAKER_00]: The override campaign, the team that was for the overrides passing really made this clear, and I think the messaging was very much like, our tax rates are extremely low, our operating budget is very small,

43
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:57,920
[SPEAKER_00]: After a certain point if someone is starving, you can't just tell them to stop starving and then give them less food You need to actually give them food in order for them to survive and get better and that's something that That's really the situation that Medford was in Obviously, you know, obviously the votes were the vote was closer than I think most of us were expecting We didn't see

44
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:07,928
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think any pollster really was able to effectively account for, you know, the sort of red wave that swept across a nation.

45
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:14,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Donald Trump was elected to a second term and he won all the swing states.

46
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:22,557
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we were also seeing that kind of shift happen within the very local elections.

47
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:31,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, going into it, I had a good feeling that these would pass.

48
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:38,439
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of thinking that it would be more like 60 40.

49
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:57,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just given what I was seeing, given what folks were telling me at the doors, um, the fact that it was closer to like 52 48 did make me a little bit nervous, but it's also, I think it's, I think it's also, uh, just is really a Testament to the strength of the organizing team.

50
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:02,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the fact that we were able to, um, you know, the fact that,

51
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:18,159
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many parents and so many people who wanted to see an investment in their children's future, who were willing to put in so much of their time into this, and just really come up with a more positive message than what we were seeing otherwise.

52
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about

53
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:32,129
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposition is a little bit tricky because I didn't want to do that so much during the campaign.

54
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of giving air to the opposition's platform was usually just not good practice.

55
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:44,817
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like now that everything is passed and we know what the vote totals are, I have a little bit more leeway to do that.

56
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,221
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was something that we were dealing with pretty consistently, so

57
00:07:54,757 --> 00:08:02,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think what the opposition was going for was just a very targeted misinformation campaign.

58
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,083
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and this was that

59
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:23,767
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up undercutting them in the long term, because it worked with some of the population, like some of the electorate, but others just ended up realizing that they were being lied to very consistently.

60
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:28,309
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of smaller instances of this happening.

61
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:31,250
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, their mailer said that it was a $37.5 million tax increase, which

62
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:40,714
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, if you use crazy math, the actual increase would have been about $9.5 million a year.

63
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,217
[SPEAKER_00]: The $37.5 million number is not anything that actually exists in reality.

64
00:08:51,033 --> 00:09:09,137
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the whole free cash thing that they just kept repeating, which is basically they're saying that we don't actually have to have this tax increase, we could just pay for an override increase through our savings account, which is, again, that's not a thing.

65
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:19,820
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just perpetually take money from your savings account, because then you just spend down your savings, and then you're left with zero dollars in the bank, and that's just not a good way to run a city.

66
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was explained dozens and dozens of times throughout the campaign.

67
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,864
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it in city council meetings.

68
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:35,231
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it in, uh, you know, I did it in letters to the editor, but it was just something that they just kept repeating, which is, it's a messaging strategy.

69
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:38,934
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you just keep repeating a simple lie, eventually people will believe it.

70
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:39,835
[SPEAKER_00]: It's propaganda.

71
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:42,077
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understood, I understood what they were going for.

72
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:45,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I also think that there are legit, there are legitimate reasons to,

73
00:09:47,076 --> 00:09:47,677
[SPEAKER_00]: the override.

74
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:50,604
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a senior on fixed income, that is definitely

75
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:59,073
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely a concern.

76
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:08,118
[SPEAKER_00]: The City Council, we're doing what we can to help people in that situation.

77
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:11,780
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're passing the maximum exemptions we can.

78
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on a program to give a housing incentive for veterans with a non-profit.

79
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,525
[SPEAKER_00]: But at a certain point, you just can't

80
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:27,277
[SPEAKER_00]: work with a budget that continuously shrinks due to inflation.

81
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:35,365
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just eventually every city will need an override and Medford was one of the last to do it so that's just that's just the situation we're in.

82
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:43,754
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposition campaign, I know something about the leadership of them, just because I pay attention to this.

83
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:52,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they kind of tried to make it an anonymous thing as much as possible, but I was kind of aware of some of the people who were involved in that.

84
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:55,907
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly a combination of former

85
00:10:57,148 --> 00:11:14,834
[SPEAKER_00]: like old guard politicians and former political candidates who just really do not like to see a progressive majority on city council and so they're just kind of this doing everything you possibly can to oppose that because you know obviously they're gonna try to run their own

86
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:43,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Candidates and they want to weaken the current The people who are currently in office and just kind of make a ruckus around that as much as possible So that's obviously going on and then other people that were also involved in the leadership were of the of the opposition campaign were really just a couple of out-of-town developers and real estate agents who own literally millions of dollars in property like, you know, I looked it up on a

87
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:53,329
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked it up online a lot of the people like a few of the people that are Listed as being on leadership of the override campaign on literally millions of dollars in property.

88
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:54,931
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't want to see it taxed.

89
00:11:55,091 --> 00:12:11,045
[SPEAKER_00]: So There's I there was lip service kind of being paid to you know, some of the fixed income folk that were that are going to be affected by this but the people that were designing the messaging I don't think I

90
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:14,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they honestly cared about that.

91
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:24,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they really just want to, they're really just trying to find a pretense to oppose the people who are currently in office at all costs.

92
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:28,298
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, my opinions on that are a little bit...

93
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:58,503
[SPEAKER_00]: are a little bit complicated because I do have like I do understand that anytime you come up with a tax increase it's not going to be It's not going to be kind of an ideal Sort of trade-off like you know you are people are going to be affected by it But on the other hand long term you just can't have a city budget that keeps shrinking And you can't just lay off 40 teachers and allow cuts to keep happening to our educational system.

94
00:12:58,543 --> 00:12:59,003
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a

95
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:07,786
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not a way to run a city, and nobody else was actually proposing a clear solution to this that we didn't refute 2,400 times.

96
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:08,486
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, I think that

97
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:37,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the messaging of the pro campaign was just a lot better We were Generally working a lot harder We were more successful at fundraising And the odds just statistically the odds are really stacked against this happening, you know again, you had a huge red wave go across like coming across the country and And

98
00:13:43,962 --> 00:13:54,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that generally means that when that happens, that there will be more people that are opposed to any tax increases happening.

99
00:13:54,788 --> 00:14:09,157
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm personally relieved that this happened, just because it means that we won't have to lay off a lot of teachers next year, and we actually will be able to see more investment in the public school system.

100
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:24,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, moving, so moving forward, what I also learned was that, you know, just running these local campaigns can be, can be a very stressful thing.

101
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:28,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was just putting a lot of my personal time into that.

102
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:36,808
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that the next time that I have to do this, it won't be quite so,

103
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,191
[SPEAKER_00]: quite as much of an intensive process.

104
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:51,939
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the first time we would ever try to pass these ballot measures, you know, you're trying something new, it would be, it'll be difficult.

105
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:56,042
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we are likely going to have to have a debt exclusion for the high school in the future.

106
00:14:56,062 --> 00:15:02,886
[SPEAKER_00]: The people currently in office and who are working on coming up with the plans for that high school made that very clear.

107
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:03,807
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.

108
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:09,564
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so other things happening.

109
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:16,866
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, obviously, um, the red wave happened, uh, about something.

110
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:18,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to look at the exact number.

111
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:25,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I think something like 20, 25% of Medford, um, voted for, uh, voted for Donald Trump.

112
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:30,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts is like the, uh, the second bluest state only to Vermont.

113
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

114
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,548
[SPEAKER_00]: in the country.

115
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:40,473
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like every other progressive politician, I've been thinking about that.

116
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:42,534
[SPEAKER_00]: So I consider myself a progressive.

117
00:15:42,554 --> 00:15:48,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also probably more in the moderate category than a lot of other politicians.

118
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:55,222
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the secretary of the Medford Democratic City and Ward Committees as well.

119
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:59,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Longer term, so, okay.

120
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:18,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's trying to come up with their own take on sort of the on sort of the election I think the pollsters were saying that it was 50-50, but you know what we actually saw was again Trump really take everything like take all of the take most of the battleground states.

121
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:27,540
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I'm more convinced that this was a Just a

122
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:37,320
[SPEAKER_00]: an effect of a very bad post-COVID economy that affected most incumbent administrations.

123
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:48,865
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a YouTuber who I linked to in my blog post who talked about the best and worst post-election takes, and I tended to agree with him.

124
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:54,088
[SPEAKER_00]: He came up with two post-election takes on what happened that I thought were

125
00:16:54,868 --> 00:16:55,428
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable.

126
00:16:55,488 --> 00:17:04,071
[SPEAKER_00]: The first was just that pretty much every incumbent government globally lost re-election this past year.

127
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:13,954
[SPEAKER_00]: The UK saw the Labour Party oust the Tory government for the first time since Tony Blair.

128
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:22,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, every other incumbent government, whether or not they're left or right, has also been kind of following the same pattern.

129
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:34,314
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend to take that view on things, which is just that this was a bad time for anybody in office to be kind of holding the ball while inflation was as high as it was.

130
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:36,516
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that

131
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:45,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Given that, you know, Trump's in office again, we're probably going to see a lot of progressive organizing happening.

132
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:47,595
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there will be a heightened interest in that.

133
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:49,256
[SPEAKER_00]: From 2016 to 2020, we just saw a ton of

134
00:17:53,117 --> 00:18:08,768
[SPEAKER_00]: that happening, a lot of people started to take an interest in local politics, got really involved in their community, and whenever you have someone who comes in, like, whenever, you know, your party has an office, you get pretty complacent.

135
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:09,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that

136
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:17,780
[SPEAKER_00]: The progressives on council did see this happening during our terms.

137
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:28,067
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when you have progressives have 6 out of 7 seats, then you do tend to get a little bit

138
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:32,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we we have been seeing Folks get a little bit complacent about it.

139
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:43,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the sort of Contention in this past the local elections that we just saw definitely mobilized a lot of people because they saw like, okay You know, you got folks elected.

140
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:56,614
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just kind of Leave them there You need to you know, continue it like show continuing support for the folks that you elect while they're trying to govern and

141
00:18:57,275 --> 00:19:02,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, so, you know, I think that it's.

142
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:29,393
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, I'm a Democrat, so I don't really have that much of a positive outlook on where things are gonna be going, but I do think that it will really get people to pay a lot more attention to local politics, and it will get people to pay, to really be encouraged to get involved, and kind of like not be,

143
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:41,451
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's my take on what's sort of been happening in Medford over the past couple of months, as well as

144
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:42,944
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally.

145
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:55,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably not able to offer as much insight on the national stuff as some other folks, but I am very proud of the fact that we were able to get these passed.

146
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:03,601
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, you know, understand that it's a pretty slim margin, so I think that probably reaching out to

147
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:14,024
[SPEAKER_00]: other folks in the community, especially those without as much computer access in different crowds that we have been engaging would be wise for the future.

148
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:19,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Seniors, especially, tend to not look at their computers as much.

149
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:21,669
[SPEAKER_00]: They get more information by word of mouth.

150
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:30,394
[SPEAKER_00]: So really engaging with that community going forward will be pretty essential.

151
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:36,988
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so that is my post-election take.

152
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:42,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all very much for your continuing support and have a wonderful day.
