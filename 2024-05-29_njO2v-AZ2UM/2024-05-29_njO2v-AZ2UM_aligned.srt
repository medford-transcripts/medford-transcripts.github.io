1
00:00:18,294 --> 00:00:22,982
Member Reinfeld, I'm not sure if you're... I'm not, yep.

2
00:00:23,683 --> 00:00:24,144
Thank you.

3
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:26,729
All right, how many years have we been Zooming?

4
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:27,790
All right.

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:41,168
So please be advised that there will be a meeting of the Curriculum, Instruction, Assessment, and Accountability Subcommittee of the Medford School Committee on Tuesday, May 28th, five o'clock p.m.

00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:07,968
The Zoom ID number is 926-407-5749.

10
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:10,470
So we will start with a roll call.

11
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,413
Do I do the roll call as the chair or does Paul, okay.

12
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:16,634
Member Branley?

13
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:18,555
Present.

14
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:20,016
Member Russo?

15
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:20,817
Present.

16
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:22,826
Member Reinfeld, present.

17
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:23,707
Three, present.

18
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:25,169
Zero, absent.

19
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,874
And we are joined by members of the administration.

20
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,858
And I believe some members of the public as well.

21
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:33,781
Thank you all so much for coming.

22
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:37,186
So this is the follow up on the resolution

23
00:01:38,027 --> 00:02:04,568
I don't actually have the resolution number in front of me, but be it resolved that the Subcommittee for Curriculum Instruction, Assessment, and Accountability meet with the Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction and other relevant staff to discuss the development of a process to review and assess recently adopted curricula and assessment tools across the district and to identify the key stakeholders, timelines, and protocols to be involved in these reviews consistent with the policies described in Section

24
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:08,246
of the Medford School Committee Online Policy Manual.

25
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:23,913
So by way of context, we've called this meeting because in recent years, the Medford Public Schools have adopted a number of new curricular materials through a robust process of review and input and stakeholder input.

26
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:34,802
And we would like to have the ability to assess whether our goals for adopting those materials are being achieved and what that looks like in terms of

27
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:38,924
the materials themselves, as well as the instruction and the student.

28
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:49,611
And by way of further context, in the Medford Public Schools strategic plan, item A1 is to establish an ongoing process of curriculum review.

29
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:59,076
So I'm happy to pull up that document with the details of that, but I've asked Dr. Galluzzi to give us an update on where we are, because phase one

30
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:07,762
is slated for 2021 through 2024 and here we are in 2024 and we'd like to get ahead of the process.

31
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:14,567
So I think if we start with an update on phase one and then discuss what phase two looks like.

32
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:19,871
Is it useful to say who's in the room here from the schools before we do that?

33
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:21,377
I would agree.

34
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:29,679
Would you, would it be okay if everybody just kind of went around and introduced themselves and what their role is within the district?

35
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,279
That would be great.

36
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,300
So, I mean, you already introduced me, but Suzanne Galussi, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction.

37
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,360
Thank you so much.

38
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,641
Maurice-Edward Vincent, Superintendent of Schools.

39
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:48,062
Joan Bowen, Director of Student Services.

40
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,872
Nicole Key is the Director of Humanities.

41
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:59,634
Isaac Han, Director of Mathematics.

42
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:06,097
Hi, Bernadette Riccadeli, Director of Professional Learning and Student Assessment.

43
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,180
Hi, Shannon Demos, Principal of the Brooks Elementary School.

44
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,624
Hi there, Jennifer Skane, Principal of Andrews Middle School.

45
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,409
Hi everyone, I'm Nick Tucci, Principal of the McGlynn Middle School.

46
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:32,814
And we definitely also have Michelle Kroll on the call.

47
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:43,160
She's the Principal of the Roberts, but I know she's just finishing up something in the building, but I wanted to make sure that she was recognized.

48
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,044
And I know somewhere Dr. Cushing was on this call as well, but I think he's just in listening mode right now.

49
00:04:53,409 --> 00:05:00,752
So, I mean, I think the best, just maybe the best way to handle some of this, we have some wonderful expertise on the call.

50
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:09,836
And so, oh, and I see Paul Texera is coming in to the call right now, the director of English Learner Department.

51
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:22,883
Um, but with all the expertise on the Paul, Paul, Paul, I'm so sorry to put you on the spot the minute you come in the room, but you mind introducing yourselves before we get going.

52
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:23,944
Um, sure.

53
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:25,044
Hi, I'm Baltic Sarah.

54
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:29,366
I'm the director of the English learner education program for the Medford public schools.

55
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:30,807
Thank you.

56
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:40,561
Member Reinfeldt, I would agree to start with, I had made a copy, if you would like, I can share my screen.

57
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:46,286
I had made a copy of the A1 curriculum document that's linked to the strategic plan.

58
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:57,075
And I just added a column so that we have like a starting point to provide an update for the work that's been done throughout the life of the strategic plan.

59
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,257
Does that sound okay?

60
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,181
All right, can everyone see my screen?

61
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:21,597
So I've lost sight of all of you, so I just need a verbal.

62
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:22,957
Yes, we can see you.

63
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:23,297
Yes.

64
00:06:23,577 --> 00:06:24,037
Thank you.

65
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:25,238
Thank you.

66
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:30,539
Okay, so this is the A1 curriculum tab from the strategic plan.

67
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:38,060
And this outlined the work that the district did between the years of 2021 and 2024, so currently.

68
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:46,363
So for each action item, we just provided an update.

69
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:53,305
So the first one said, deliver professional development activities related to the revisions of the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

70
00:06:54,026 --> 00:07:06,190
So internally, we have a spreadsheet that Dr. Riccadeli started and that we've been updating, which speaks to the current curriculum per each department.

71
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:17,004
And it kind of lets us know where we are within the curriculum cycle per department, per grade level.

72
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:27,110
I'm not quite sure if you'd like me to just also open that up and just briefly, I don't know if we need to necessarily hit every tab.

73
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,291
I don't think we should dive deep, but just to get a sense of what that looks like.

74
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:30,871
Just to get a sense.

75
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:32,832
So like this is the English language arts one.

76
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,774
So you can see it goes from K to 12 and it just,

77
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:52,462
lists the program that's being used, when the implementation year was, the criteria and the components of the program, and a little baseline as to when it would be up for the next review cycle.

78
00:07:52,482 --> 00:08:03,930
And we have that for all of our departments, just to get an understanding of how we're tracking things internally.

79
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:13,969
So the second action item was use a protocol for assessing instructional materials for bias.

80
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:24,273
So this is part of the core review process we go through when we're looking at reviewing curriculum updates, as well as brand new programs.

81
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:27,914
And part of that cycle per the Department of Education

82
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:39,957
includes a review of ed reports and the curate system so that part of that review is done when we are updating the curriculum within each department.

83
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:49,967
Please just like interrupt with any questions or if there's administrators on the call that want to add to anything I'm saying, just chime in please.

84
00:08:51,169 --> 00:09:03,573
The next action item is to create a master list of adoption cycle curriculum offerings, which we have done, as I showed in the updated curriculum catalog.

85
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:12,376
And then one of the things that we've been working on is a draft process to finalize

86
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:26,119
that curriculum review process from Medford Public Schools, which I think we can maybe highlight once I get through the action items just so that we can provide first a base review of the work we've done.

87
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:26,660
Okay.

88
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,602
So the next one just says update curriculum.

89
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:30,903
So this is something

90
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:34,286
as in that spreadsheet that's ongoing.

91
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:41,991
So, you know, sometimes it's that we've been with a curriculum for a long time and we're seeing that we need something new because it's not maybe hitting student needs.

92
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:50,778
Sometimes it's the Massachusetts Department of Education has updated the frameworks and the standards that teachers use when they're teaching.

93
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:55,561
And so there are many reasons why we initiate curriculum reviews.

94
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:59,944
When the strategic plan was written in 2020,

95
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:02,605
for a launch in 2021.

96
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:11,107
This column here highlighted some of the work that was, had begun and or ongoing, or maybe nearly completed.

97
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:17,049
And so over here, the updates per department are all listed here.

98
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:29,272
So for the humanities, text lists were provided, texts, like lists of the texts that grade six through eight and 11 were using the elementary,

99
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,633
started the core review process for a new curriculum last year.

100
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:39,276
And last year was like the review process.

101
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:44,580
This year was the full implementation of the Houghton Mifflin program.

102
00:10:45,100 --> 00:11:01,113
PD has been sustained and embedded all year long, both through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who's the publisher of the program, as well as through a partnership we have with HILFA Literacy, which is a literacy consulting firm of expert

103
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:04,658
reading specialists in the field.

104
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:09,866
Physical education and health is quite long because they've been doing a lot of work.

105
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:14,875
So their health curriculum updated per the Department of Education in 2023.

106
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:24,773
And so I know that director Rachel Perry, along with assistant superintendent, Dr. Cushing, they both sat on the HECAC committee.

107
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:29,917
I believe member Reinfeldt, member Rousseau also sat on that committee.

108
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:36,943
I'm apologizing if anyone else on this meeting also sat on that committee and I failed to acknowledge you, I apologize.

109
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:40,726
But I know they've done a lot of work.

110
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:41,987
So this is the,

111
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:49,627
In a snapshot, I know the biggest implementations, that work is ongoing.

112
00:11:49,747 --> 00:12:00,190
So this year, the fifth grade puberty has shifted the curriculum that we're using and the approach and the format that we're using.

113
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:02,811
Those lessons have started this year.

114
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:07,693
And so some of the work is still continuous as they're looking to update

115
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:17,842
per the frameworks, but I know that they began with the health curriculum, and then she's looking to move next to the physical education curriculum.

116
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:28,247
So implemented this year, as I have said, was the fifth grade puberty lessons, along with making sure that that work aligned.

117
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:37,312
We've updated Nexus at the elementary level, so that Nexus is handling the health curriculum, which is Michigan model.

118
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:38,606
Ms.

119
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:43,610
Perry has been working directly with the Nexus teachers in that department.

120
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:52,937
And I know that the work to finish the new sex ed curriculum will be finished next year.

121
00:12:53,597 --> 00:13:07,167
She has listed here recommendations, and again, the work with the PE department that will begin next year, as you see here, to develop a physical education committee.

122
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:23,580
World Language also had frameworks somewhat recently updated, and so Dr. Vilma Bobo has started working with her staff to review the updated standards.

123
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:33,945
She's provided numerous opportunities for professional development and professional affiliations within her department, and

124
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:43,386
lesson plans and curricula will be aligned next year based on the work that she's been doing within her department to update to the frameworks.

125
00:13:45,345 --> 00:14:06,201
Math, as we all know, and Faiza can speak to this much more closely than I can, but she has been in a constant state of alignment and adjustment within the math department, both at the middle school and the high school level to align to the integrated math pathways.

126
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:11,765
And elementary last year went through their full implementation year.

127
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,471
of the investigations three curriculum.

128
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,852
So this is year two for that curriculum.

129
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:24,454
Science FOSS was implemented, I believe, in 2018.

130
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:29,716
So next year we'll be looking to kind of review FOSS.

131
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:33,004
and see where we go from there.

132
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:43,472
And then the rest is pretty much, some of it is reiterating the things that I have just said in terms of the departments.

133
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:52,358
Additional information for science would be that at middle school, the STEM scopes curriculum was implemented in school year 2021.

134
00:14:55,908 --> 00:15:01,632
High school ranges, which is reflective in the spreadsheet, but it ranges depending on the course.

135
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:11,559
So some of the curriculum began in 2019, where others were just updated last school year or this school year.

136
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,160
We spoke about health and world language.

137
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,365
And the only other piece right now would be technology.

138
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:34,101
Molly Layden, Director Molly Layden has worked to update the technology curriculum that is offered through the schools.

139
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:44,304
One of the things that she will begin, the work that will begin next year is updating the library curriculum to align with the library media.

140
00:15:45,939 --> 00:16:02,785
And then the last piece of an update, the last action item here speaks of review of new research-based comprehensive elementary literacy programs, rubrics to select elementary literacy programs and then implement literacy, elementary literacy programs.

141
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:11,369
So that was a mouthful, but basically this has kind of two levels to it.

142
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:15,110
One was the work we did to become compliant with the,

143
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:22,352
Massachusetts literacy screener regulations under the dyslexia regulation.

144
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:30,897
And so that was the we've had like a tiered approach to that and that was this bottom piece here, which is

145
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:40,585
the pilot of the DIBELS program, which fully meets, it's like full compliance per the Department of Education for meeting the literacy screener regulation.

146
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:52,729
That pilot was done last year, and it was fully implemented this year, elementary K-5, so all K-5 students received the benchmark DIBELS.

147
00:16:54,669 --> 00:17:05,016
and grades six through eight intervention students received DIBELS, either in a benchmark or progress monitoring situation.

148
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:12,455
When it comes to, oh, also we implemented ECRI, which is Enhanced Core Reading Instruction.

149
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:21,760
This was to also comply to make sure that our reading instruction is structured and explicit.

150
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:28,945
And so all of our K-2 staff use ECRI when they're teaching reading to their students.

151
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:35,538
In terms of the core review process, the Department of Education, as I stated, is very

152
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:41,916
Particular about the process that's used when we when districts are selecting new curriculum.

153
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:47,779
And so this core review process as aligned by ed reports and the curate system.

154
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,561
We used helpful literacy to help us engage in that work.

155
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,224
For the ELA reading program.

156
00:17:56,945 --> 00:18:00,707
This folder that's linked here also kind of explains

157
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:04,431
the core review process, which was quite extensive.

158
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:20,223
It included teachers, administrators, and caregivers to narrow down ELA programs and to finally select the one into reading that was implemented this year.

159
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:29,351
Any questions before I maybe stop the screen share?

160
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:42,881
I do apologize, I've lost the ability to see people.

161
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:47,025
So I'm not quite sure if there are hands in the air.

162
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:47,825
Am I okay?

163
00:18:47,845 --> 00:18:48,986
I don't see any.

164
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:51,648
I have a quick question.

165
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:54,130
So just, it's Nicole Brantley.

166
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,691
I know if you can see me, I'm sure you know this voice.

167
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:09,963
My question, I guess, this just makes me think as I'm seeing, you know, some of these names and some of these positions, how do we go about these strategies if some of these positions are cut?

168
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,812
Who does this fall on?

169
00:19:15,473 --> 00:19:23,600
So I think, I mean, with all due respect, I think that that's maybe a conversation for a different meeting.

170
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:40,214
I think today, right now, we're kind of charged with talking about how we're going to create a process to show that our curriculum is effectively working for students.

171
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:55,775
And I think that having all of these lovely experts here, I would really love to be able to have that conversation and tap into the school and department leaders that are on the call today.

172
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:59,197
But I welcome that conversation at another point.

173
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:02,839
I will not forget my question, Mrs. Galluzzi.

174
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:03,339
Don't worry.

175
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:03,820
Thank you.

176
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,381
I welcome that.

177
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:06,881
Thank you.

178
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:08,502
I know you always do.

179
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:09,163
I appreciate it.

180
00:20:09,183 --> 00:20:09,503
Thank you.

181
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,826
Member Russo, did you have any questions, particularly as someone who's seen a lot of these curricula come in?

182
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:18,390
No.

183
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:18,870
No.

184
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:19,251
OK.

185
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:28,399
All right, so I think what we want to do, so this gives us a really good foundation for what's been done, what's in progress.

186
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:40,441
I think one of the goals in calling this subcommittee at this point in time is to say, so some of these things are due to be evaluated regularly, and that process is in place.

187
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:45,623
But one of the things I want to be really thoughtful about is,

188
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:50,447
that there are a few different stages of assessing these.

189
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:56,773
And I know this is ridiculous for me to say with this many educators on the call.

190
00:20:57,273 --> 00:21:10,406
But one of the things that I've been thinking about in regards to this is that didactic triangle where the content is one piece of a triangle and the students and the teachers are the other points and assessing the content.

191
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:16,994
isn't just about the content itself, but it's about the relationship that that content has to the teachers and the students.

192
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:25,583
I think the review process isn't necessarily a conversation about the teacher-student relationship, but it is to the content and the

193
00:21:26,424 --> 00:21:27,966
into the teachers and the students.

194
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:33,030
And so some of that looks like, for the content and the teachers, that looks like the implementation.

195
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:35,773
And is this doing, is this working?

196
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:43,660
Are these things being implemented with fidelity and in a way that the teachers are adequately trained to teach this?

197
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,565
And then that seems to me something that needs to come earlier than the process of

198
00:21:50,666 --> 00:22:09,510
assessing whether the students have mastery of the content or whether they're in well hopefully the engagement with the content is coming sooner and to be able to assess that through observations through test scores whatever it is and what that process looks like so it's not just we're looking at everything all together once we hit

199
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,872
the six years or the curriculum expires in 2029.

200
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:16,173
So we're just deciding if we're gonna renew it.

201
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:24,738
I'd like to make sure that we have a process in place to review that in a strategic targeted way at selected points.

202
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:35,283
And you all on the call know far better than I do what is feasible, because as we all know, the more time you spend talking to people about what they're doing, that's less time that they're actually doing it.

203
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:47,930
So figuring out what that balance is, is something that I'd like to kind of lay out in terms of the timeline, who the stakeholders are, and the role that different people are going to be playing in a review process.

204
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:50,531
Thank you for that.

205
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:52,932
I appreciate that.

206
00:22:53,533 --> 00:23:02,197
I think that is one of the main reasons why the district moved to bring in NWEA map growth.

207
00:23:03,878 --> 00:23:04,319
Because

208
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:20,384
I think we all know, so we have multiple measures of assessment and some are ongoing and some are kind of like a snapshot and MCAS is an end of year

209
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:30,728
benchmark through the Department of Education, but it is, it's a one time test.

210
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:31,749
It's not a system.

211
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:35,614
And so, NWEA, NWEA map growth.

212
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,884
checked some of those boxes for us in that it is aligned to Common Core standards.

213
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:57,297
It did include science, and a lot of these district-wide assessment measures only started with, like I-Ready, for example, were just math and reading, or ELA.

214
00:23:58,098 --> 00:24:16,992
And so one of the things that intrigued us about MAP was that it also included the science components so that we had these set benchmarks to see how our students are faring on common core standards outside of the curricula itself.

215
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:22,216
And so I think that is definitely a component that we rely on.

216
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:44,732
But I think engaging in the conversation around the validity and the timeline is important because some programs are probably in the just right spot, while it's difficult to look at some of those scores and call it a reliable measure in like the first year of implementation.

217
00:24:45,632 --> 00:25:03,816
So I know that Miss Khan, I don't know if not to put her on the spot, but I know she has seen some tremendous progress per MAP scores at the end of the year here in math, which is we're in like year two of the curriculum implementation.

218
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:11,978
But we're not going to see that growth yet, you know, for reading because this is at least at the elementary level, this is like year one of the program.

219
00:25:12,618 --> 00:25:13,218
So I think

220
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:21,188
And then there is the piece of, to your point, like the observational and the instruction and the fidelity to the program.

221
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:30,072
But I think it's important to continue this conversation so that it is in a more formalized manner.

222
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:35,994
But I would offer other people to kind of

223
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:38,614
chime in if they feel.

224
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:38,954
Yes.

225
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:39,515
Yeah.

226
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:49,098
And I would love to hear from the folks on the ground there as you know, is, is map testing giving you the information you need and what other information do you need?

227
00:25:49,138 --> 00:25:50,778
What are, what are the ways to get that?

228
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,820
Because I think as we all know, we, we don't all want it.

229
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,361
We don't want to just make test scores the measure of success.

230
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:00,221
What are the, what are the metrics we need here?

231
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:04,763
Can you hear me?

232
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:06,441
Yes.

233
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:07,082
Yes.

234
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:11,785
Just may I answer a piece of that that you were asking, right?

235
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:12,725
Okay.

236
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:23,952
I do think one of the things we've been really successful with is triangulating the math data with other data points that we have within the classroom.

237
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:26,133
So we've done some really good work.

238
00:26:27,274 --> 00:26:29,856
Many people on this call who, and beyond,

239
00:26:31,237 --> 00:26:46,128
where we look at how are they performing on map in terms of their growth from fall to winter to spring, but not just looking at that data point, triangulating that for literacy, the dibbles, and then taking it a step further and cross-referencing back to MCAS.

240
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:49,270
Those are some data points as well as performance within the classroom.

241
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,914
Those are some data points that are gonna kind of give us an indicator of where do we need tier two support?

242
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:58,257
Where are we, you know, what components are we thriving in?

243
00:26:58,877 --> 00:26:59,738
And it's been very interesting

244
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,392
formative when we've been able to look at those data points together.

245
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:15,982
So I'm not sure if that answers your question, but I have found it very useful to see where we have some students that may be at risk, that maybe we weren't aware of.

246
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:28,171
And then when we go back with the team, even mentions in the programs themselves, go from there.

247
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:52,208
And if I could piggyback on what Nicole just started sharing, to say that as I think about the NWEA map, the other assessments, in particular the MCAS, the common complaint about the MCAS is that it's only given once a year at the end of the year.

248
00:27:52,688 --> 00:28:00,891
And so you're not able to really target the areas that were identified as areas of weakness because the students change grades,

249
00:28:01,451 --> 00:28:03,153
The standards continue to evolve.

250
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:12,522
So it's kind of like you're working backwards, but you're not working really strategically because every year there can be a shift.

251
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:21,651
And I think in the absence of not having had a consistent assessment tool across the district at all,

252
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:36,946
to finally have NWEA MAP as a tool that you can use as one measure, but a measure that you can use multiple times in a given year to get that beginning, middle, and end.

253
00:28:37,687 --> 00:28:41,450
And you can still do the mid checkpoints and there are a lot of other assessments.

254
00:28:42,111 --> 00:29:01,104
and different ways that the data can be sliced, that you can really use it to inform your instruction and make real-time changes instead of waiting until you get the MCAS results the following year and you're looking at different students that are sitting right in front of you.

255
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:13,828
So as we're looking at data and the data is being triangulated, it's critically important to say we now have data, how can we make it actionable?

256
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:27,212
I think that as we're looking at curriculum and different programs, the programs can always shift, but if everything is aligned to the standards and we are actually able to measure growth,

257
00:29:28,631 --> 00:29:31,972
those are the conversations that will happen with data teams.

258
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:37,714
Those are the conversations that are going to give us improved outcomes for our students.

259
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:44,577
Because with the absence of data, you don't know, are your students really making adequate growth?

260
00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:50,058
And so I will continue to champion NWEA MAP.

261
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,300
And if the district were to choose a different

262
00:29:55,396 --> 00:30:05,823
assessment tool, it would need to be something that you could use to get multiple points of data so you could measure your progress and your growth.

263
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:12,207
And I feel like the work that's happening now is the work that we needed to be doing.

264
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:24,796
And now that we have it and people know what to expect with these assessments, you're really going to be able to be targeted, specific, laser-like focus in terms of

265
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:30,561
You know what, my students did not get this particular standard we're going to reteach it.

266
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:42,273
And those are like the really rich conversations that happen, either in grade level teams, or if you're looking at it from a school level, to be able to say, are there trends.

267
00:30:42,913 --> 00:30:55,995
that our students are not making progress with or look at everyone is hitting these particular standards and we're doing very well in these areas, let's keep up the good work here and make the necessary shifts.

268
00:30:56,496 --> 00:31:09,098
So I know we're talking specifically about NWEA MAP, which again is norm referenced and it's a national assessment, but even if it wasn't NWEA MAP, we would still need to have

269
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:16,974
something that we could measure more than once a year while the students are still in front of their educators.

270
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:18,686
So that's.

271
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:19,146
Yeah.

272
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:20,687
And I just don't want to lose sight of.

273
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:25,968
So the scope of this meeting is about assessing the curricula, not necessarily student gains.

274
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:38,052
Obviously, part of the goal of these curricula is to reflect student gains, but to make sure that we're measuring something that tells us whether the goals of adopting a given curriculum are being met.

275
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:39,612
But I see hands in the air.

276
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:40,272
So I think Ms.

277
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:41,213
Demos was first.

278
00:31:46,912 --> 00:31:47,753
Oh, did we lose her?

279
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:48,414
Oh, you're up.

280
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:49,836
You're on mute, Shannon.

281
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:51,859
Sorry, I thought I clicked it.

282
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,462
So thank you for the opportunity.

283
00:31:55,323 --> 00:32:01,512
Dr. Vincent actually took a little bit of what I was going to say, but what I wanted to say sort of echoes the fact that

284
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:09,716
The NWEA scores really drive a lot of our instruction in differentiation and groupings here.

285
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:20,402
And I'm sure for my colleagues across the district as well, it allows us to have conversations during our ILT and our CPTs with the staff.

286
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:33,386
And it really kind of drives along the discussions of, okay, what is this new program covering that our old curriculum didn't, but then where are the gaps that we need to put in some tiered support across the grade levels?

287
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:43,090
It allows me as the instructional leader of the school to see are these trends something that is across the grade level, or is it something that I need to go in

288
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:50,995
have some support conversations with my individual staffs that maybe a little bit needs a little bit more guidance versus somebody else.

289
00:32:51,035 --> 00:33:05,103
So I really encourage us to continue with this because that beginning, middle and end data is a big point for us as far as our groupings for next year, for our next week's centers.

290
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:07,084
We get so much data from it.

291
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:13,208
I really do appreciate the fact that we were given this resource and I hope to see it continue.

292
00:33:14,517 --> 00:33:16,058
Thank you, Mr. Teixeira.

293
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:19,180
Thank you.

294
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,061
So we use the map data a little bit differently.

295
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:32,767
We'll have all of our students, whether they're newcomers or Yale pullout students, they take the math map test because that's informing us, obviously,

296
00:33:33,462 --> 00:33:39,467
Fifth grade looks different in Brazil than it does in China, than it does in Haiti, than it does in the US.

297
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:53,779
So because it is based on the standards, we can target what our students are missing, not due to lack of instruction here, but what they didn't get in their countries prior to coming in, because we place them by grade level.

298
00:33:53,879 --> 00:34:01,786
So if they're in seventh grade and they missed fifth grade skills, we can hone in on that using the map data.

299
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:13,882
And then for the ELA map, only our pull-out students who are level 3-4 EL or higher will take the map ELA test.

300
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:16,743
And we use that data to make our placement decisions.

301
00:34:17,563 --> 00:34:26,506
If they're ready to exit from the EL program, it's another piece of data in addition to the access test, if we can place them in mainstream classrooms.

302
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:31,286
And then we also just, we use the science in a similar way.

303
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:43,520
MCAS is just fifth and eighth grade there, but it helps us kind of hone in on what skills that they may be missing because of cultural differences with educational systems in different countries.

304
00:34:49,123 --> 00:34:59,389
And sorry, Mr. Tixera, the list that we just saw from Dr. Galussi of the curricula, how many of those have the built-in ELA support?

305
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:03,191
I know it was included versus a separate curriculum.

306
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:08,114
Yeah, so we do have a separate ELD curriculum, English Language Development curriculum.

307
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:10,756
And I'm not sure.

308
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:16,019
I have a different list that I added, and I may have missed this, Suzanne.

309
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,980
As you were going through it, I didn't add my stuff.

310
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:24,849
So we have English language development curriculum based on students' grade level and their English language proficiency level.

311
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:47,926
And so currently right now what's happening in the elementary, because we now have a new program into reading, the HMH program, our EL curriculum hasn't changed, but we're updating the curriculum to support the new materials being used to deliver that curriculum.

312
00:35:54,812 --> 00:35:54,952
Ms.

313
00:35:54,992 --> 00:35:55,312
Khan.

314
00:35:57,392 --> 00:35:57,973
Real quick.

315
00:35:58,853 --> 00:35:59,453
Can you hear me?

316
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:00,313
Yes.

317
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:01,334
All right.

318
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:01,974
So good.

319
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,955
So I want to bring another perspective to map testing.

320
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:21,301
I use it very often also to see how I can support the teachers because every teacher's classroom is different and all the teachers, you know, every classroom, because by the nature of it, have different set of students.

321
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:36,832
And that gives me a look into how I can support a particular teacher when I look at, you know, two similar classrooms and see, all right, this is where, you know, my PD needs are, this is how I need to coach.

322
00:36:37,192 --> 00:36:40,835
So I use it in that capacity as well.

323
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:43,117
Thank you.

324
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:44,658
Mr. Tucci.

325
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:53,142
Yes, hi, just from a secondary school leader perspective, I'll just chime in to almost echo what Dr. Keza was saying, but expand upon it too as well.

326
00:36:53,162 --> 00:37:00,664
And that we use a lot of the triangulation data in order to inform our approach as to how to utilize our wind block over the course of the school year.

327
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:11,348
So oftentimes what you'll see is that teachers will work with separate different groups of students and we'll have different intervention kind of groups within a team-based wind block opportunity for our students.

328
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,509
So that was one thing that hadn't been mentioned.

329
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:21,817
And also one other thing that hadn't been mentioned by my colleagues is how I feel like the MAP growth data can be very useful as a great resource for families too as well.

330
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,819
Oftentimes we're having family meetings.

331
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:33,127
We love to be able to present the MAP growth data and the family report and be able to share that information to work in partnership with our families in the work that we do.

332
00:37:33,448 --> 00:37:33,688
Thank you.

333
00:37:35,151 --> 00:37:35,591
Thank you.

334
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:42,274
That actually, if anyone else has comments, I welcome them, but that seems like a reasonable transition to identify.

335
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:47,956
Oh, Dr. K. Sorry, I just, I wanted to add, because I know I broke up before, so hopefully you can hear me better now.

336
00:37:49,936 --> 00:38:03,441
We have an example of how we related the data to the curriculum, which I believe is kind of one of your questions, was when we saw a deficit, NWEA, when we first began it, and we saw a deficit in the foundational reading skills,

337
00:38:03,956 --> 00:38:10,481
We did pull in ECRI, our Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, as more of a foundational program.

338
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:22,229
And we did see success in the student scores, which then told us that ECRI was one of the tools that was successful in that.

339
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:25,772
And I know that Dr. Gluzzi has done a lot of work along with myself.

340
00:38:26,393 --> 00:38:28,917
on continuing that, as it seemed protective.

341
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:36,611
But that is an example of how the assessment helped not just speak to the student, but also to the curriculum, if that's what you were referencing.

342
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:38,014
Yes, that is.

343
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:49,689
And that speaks to the other kind of takeaway I wanted to get from this, which is the timeline of when that, it sounds like MAP provides a lot of flexibility for doing a lot of that in real time.

344
00:38:50,269 --> 00:39:03,434
And if that is embedded in the process, I don't know how much more explicit it needs to be, but I'm interested in kind of identifying who are the stakeholders in making those decisions and getting that input.

345
00:39:03,494 --> 00:39:06,756
I know when curricula is chosen, it's done with community input.

346
00:39:07,336 --> 00:39:13,761
from families, obviously a lot of, most of the folks in families are not educators or curriculum developers.

347
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:18,724
So, but they can speak to the experiential component of things.

348
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:26,590
And of course, the teachers who are teaching it saying this is working, this is not working anecdotally, qualitatively.

349
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:33,235
So identifying who those parties are and when they come into the review process.

350
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:39,700
I think would be a useful exercise for this call.

351
00:39:41,522 --> 00:39:42,302
I think we agree.

352
00:39:42,743 --> 00:39:56,975
And I know that when we've engaged in the curriculum review cycle for, let's just say, a new program, new curriculum, following that core review process has always included

353
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:10,848
varied stakeholders so it has always included administration as well as teachers and caregivers and but we don't we haven't really had anything necessarily like formalized.

354
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:36,104
I know that just taking that process, we have a slight draft of what that process looks like, but I think what you're speaking about is that final part of the process where you're in the implementation phase, but then that implementation phase also leads into the monitoring phase.

355
00:40:38,062 --> 00:40:44,868
What does that look like as we're monitoring the curriculum to see how it's meeting the needs of our students?

356
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:56,757
And when that varied use of stakeholders kind of enters that monitoring phase, I do think is worthy of discussion.

357
00:40:57,177 --> 00:40:58,879
And I think it's going to look different.

358
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,571
at each level and at each department.

359
00:41:04,912 --> 00:41:08,594
And I think we, you know, you use data to kind of guide those discussions.

360
00:41:08,654 --> 00:41:21,422
So right now we're seeing some positive, like just for example, not to always kind of like say something to FISA, but like we're seeing some like positive data around the math.

361
00:41:23,963 --> 00:41:26,845
But in terms of, you know,

362
00:41:27,455 --> 00:41:34,417
I mean, so that math piece is in the monitoring phase that will stay in the monitoring phase for a couple more years.

363
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:44,020
But if we see a dip in that student data, then it's going to warrant a closer eye.

364
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:55,783
And I think the other piece, like to my point, is that some of that other data around like triangulation, especially maybe just for FISA's piece, but for all the departments,

365
00:41:57,211 --> 00:42:25,886
is I would also welcome a conversation around like trajectory data, because I think that like part of the push for math was because FISA was seeing some data about the preparedness of students in advanced opportunities in like grades, you know, I guess nine, 10 and on, as well as what the enrollment looks like in some of our advanced placement classes, honors and AP.

366
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:35,857
FISA and curriculum directors are also monitoring the scores that our students are receiving on AP exams.

367
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:50,707
And so I think even just having a conversation around the kind of data that's important to make some of these decisions beyond map data also would be a worthwhile discussion.

368
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,415
Are there thoughts from the group on that?

369
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:06,142
And also giving some attention to non-MCAS subjects as well.

370
00:43:06,602 --> 00:43:17,752
I know we've been talking about NWEA MAP, but a lot of the math and the literacy is baked into things where there's a little more.

371
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:33,287
I don't want to say leeway in other programs, because it is they're absolutely rigorous and to standards, but how can we make sure that's being included in this process and that those programs are getting what they need.

372
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:50,975
So I think that also varies from department to department, like world language, Dr. Bobo, there's like the seal of biliteracy.

373
00:43:52,115 --> 00:43:58,198
I mean, there are AP courses as well, but there's also the seal of biliteracy.

374
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,140
And then there's also just, there's enrollment.

375
00:44:04,301 --> 00:44:11,924
And so at least at the high school level where students have a choice, starting in grade 10 with really like what their,

376
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:29,880
taking as both like electives and just enrollment in course selection is also useful data for us to kind of track, you know, the interest in students as well as the persistence.

377
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,251
but I do defer to my experts on the call.

378
00:44:39,152 --> 00:44:47,713
I would agree just from the social studies perspective, which we do have an eighth grade MCAS pilot this year, but not anything set in stone.

379
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:50,294
We see it with the civics project.

380
00:44:50,494 --> 00:44:55,575
We have a civics learning project that's mandatory for our eighth graders and our 11th graders.

381
00:44:56,095 --> 00:45:00,156
And when we look at the quality of those projects and then the engagement after, for me it's,

382
00:45:01,596 --> 00:45:06,798
It's, of course, beyond numbers of how well somebody did on an assessment, but are they engaged?

383
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:12,280
Are they, you know, moving on to more civics-oriented projects once they hit eighth grade?

384
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:23,665
Those are valuable pieces of data that we look at as a department as well, along with, of course, you know, the civics project and what they're doing within the classroom.

385
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:28,899
That's great.

386
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:37,744
And that speaks to another question I had for this group, which is the cross-departmental influence, right?

387
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:40,006
I see Mr. Cieri is on the call.

388
00:45:40,506 --> 00:45:47,050
Do our students taking advanced science classes have the advanced math skills that they need to do that?

389
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,732
And what room in reviewing curricula saying,

390
00:45:50,732 --> 00:46:07,715
The next grade is getting students are coming in with the knowledge that they need to succeed at this grade and with this curriculum or looking at across you know do a piece does the statistics department have the statistics students have these math skills or these critical thinking skills that come from a humanities program.

391
00:46:09,015 --> 00:46:26,701
And so I'm wondering what cross-curricular opportunities there are to say this is a program that speaks to multiple needs, and certainly at the elementary school level, foundational math, foundational reading, but being able to make those connections across areas.

392
00:46:29,782 --> 00:46:31,523
I think Rocco and Fiza could speak to that.

393
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:34,584
They work very closely on that.

394
00:46:36,513 --> 00:46:37,334
Do either of you wanna?

395
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:44,859
And particularly in terms of being able to review curricula with that in mind, not just are the students getting these things, but.

396
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:49,602
I think Ms.

397
00:46:49,662 --> 00:46:52,985
Renfield, your question is, it's twofold.

398
00:46:53,085 --> 00:47:02,232
It's what the curriculum offers and what it expects as a baseline.

399
00:47:04,737 --> 00:47:20,475
In, for example, if you are choosing something in science, you have to make sure that the reading level of the material is appropriate that the that the math reasoning skills are appropriate and is there crossover within those documents about.

400
00:47:22,563 --> 00:47:26,584
what can be done with the curriculum that's in place.

401
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:33,845
And that is absolutely something that we're aware of when we do our reviews.

402
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:39,106
I'm not, I don't recall, I looked at the document very briefly.

403
00:47:39,146 --> 00:47:46,828
I don't recall if that point is embedded in the curriculum review process as part of it.

404
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:57,827
you know, in the newest document that you have, but it would be really valuable to put in there as a point of reference that, you know, looking at

405
00:47:58,951 --> 00:48:09,520
you know, the range of Lexile levels of the materials would be good to know before a curriculum is purchased or implemented.

406
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,344
The same for the math skills when you're looking at a science program.

407
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:21,409
I'm thinking more in particular as K to eight rather than the high school, because at the,

408
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:37,585
At the elective level, after chemistry, the expectation is that students have a particular level of mathematical or at least computational skill that sometimes may

409
00:48:43,135 --> 00:48:51,242
may say that this particular alternative that they're choosing may not match, may not be well aligned to what their skill set is.

410
00:48:51,322 --> 00:48:53,984
So that's certainly in the mix.

411
00:48:54,544 --> 00:49:02,410
And I'm thinking at the more advanced classes, the AP class in physics, for example, where you need to have

412
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:06,753
simultaneous instruction in calculus.

413
00:49:07,073 --> 00:49:18,479
So if you have to have simultaneous instruction in calculus and the book has calculus in it, and it's a physics course, then how do students reach that level?

414
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:21,200
The text has to be that particular level.

415
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:26,763
Which groups of students are qualified to reach that particular level?

416
00:49:27,523 --> 00:49:32,426
Um, so it's a big range and there's a lot that probably has to be considered.

417
00:49:32,446 --> 00:49:54,920
Um, but I would certainly put in there that when a curriculum is reviewed, you know, are we looking for the alignment grade level or at least grade band level, uh, for the students, uh, in their ELA, um, or their, their linguistic, uh, background and in their mathematical understanding.

418
00:49:56,554 --> 00:50:01,196
And that taps into a question that we had brought up earlier of, is it the material?

419
00:50:01,396 --> 00:50:02,577
Is it the implementation?

420
00:50:02,597 --> 00:50:03,858
Is it the instruction?

421
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:14,263
And really being able to assess it out, because we don't want to throw out a curriculum that has a lot of potential and would be doing well if there were more training.

422
00:50:15,323 --> 00:50:19,325
But we also don't want to keep hammering away at a curriculum that isn't working.

423
00:50:21,426 --> 00:50:24,247
So I saw two hands go up, although one of them, I think, just went down.

424
00:50:26,872 --> 00:50:27,272
Faiza?

425
00:50:29,214 --> 00:50:30,055
Yes, hi.

426
00:50:30,975 --> 00:50:43,965
I wanted to add that there are certain standards in mathematics in which we can work across content.

427
00:50:43,985 --> 00:50:45,687
So, for example, in geometry.

428
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:55,281
This is something that connects very well with certain shops that we have at Medford Vocational Technical High School.

429
00:50:55,801 --> 00:51:02,067
So just recently, the mathematics department has been working on

430
00:51:02,885 --> 00:51:17,758
creating more projects at least once a quarter in every subject that is going to involve some kind of cross-content partnership.

431
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,860
So, I've been encouraging teachers to do that.

432
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,322
It's a work in progress.

433
00:51:22,782 --> 00:51:26,525
Some courses have one done, others have a couple done.

434
00:51:27,486 --> 00:51:34,131
We just kicked it off after COVID, so it's taking time, but we are getting there.

435
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:40,156
The other thing that has been mentioned is the curriculum.

436
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:50,640
The three curriculums that we have, one is a pathway and the other two are the curriculums, illustrative mathematics and investigations.

437
00:51:51,741 --> 00:52:03,514
We ensured that it's not just emphasizing on procedural stuff, because if it's just emphasizing on students' procedural understanding,

438
00:52:04,234 --> 00:52:12,022
then that doesn't leave any room for any kind of thinking and problem solving that comes in through these projects.

439
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:28,116
So we are working towards getting our students ready from very early age to be able to handle these cross-content projects that will come their way, maybe as early as middle school, but definitely at the high school level.

440
00:52:29,501 --> 00:52:43,707
There is a potential, you know, we are always thinking of ways teachers are, I mean, we have a personal finance course, a consumer math course that involves, you know, some civics and some economics.

441
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:50,209
So, I'm very proud of those particular courses, and teachers have worked hard to develop those curriculums.

442
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,490
So, as I said, there is potential.

443
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,651
We are working on it.

444
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,111
It's a work in progress.

445
00:52:58,263 --> 00:53:10,209
That's another great point that I think is not quite this meeting, but when a teacher brings a curriculum to the district and how that gets adopted and assessing that.

446
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,511
So that's a great point as well.

447
00:53:15,132 --> 00:53:15,492
Nicole?

448
00:53:19,184 --> 00:53:19,444
Sorry.

449
00:53:20,585 --> 00:53:34,916
You know, I just wanted to add, like, when we think about literacy across the content areas, we think about reading, as Mr. Cieri just said, and the levels and the ability to access informational texts versus fictional texts.

450
00:53:35,237 --> 00:53:36,618
But we also think about writing.

451
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:41,241
So looking at how our writing is crossing over curriculum is

452
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:47,926
something that is really critical for social studies in English, but certainly Ms.

453
00:53:49,547 --> 00:53:54,231
Khan and Mr. Seary and I work closely to kind of think about those expectations.

454
00:53:54,651 --> 00:54:01,816
At the middle school level, we can have team cross-curricular activities, which we certainly do with social studies in English.

455
00:54:02,757 --> 00:54:10,683
And at the high school, we have some courses that are ones called humanities that's actually English and social studies, because the US history

456
00:54:11,423 --> 00:54:15,991
and the American lit lines up together, so the class is combined.

457
00:54:16,713 --> 00:54:23,785
But also with arts, we've seen a lot with social studies through the arts, so working with

458
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:38,066
The arts coordinators, you know, we have a class called art and ideas looking at historical art and have students that are doing like docent trainers at Museum of Fine Arts, which is kind of getting beyond those walls of the classroom and having that crossover.

459
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:43,007
But certainly getting back to the curriculum itself that that writing component is essential.

460
00:54:45,808 --> 00:54:50,450
constantly assessing, because MAP isn't going to tell us much about that.

461
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:52,851
DIBLS isn't going to tell us anything about that.

462
00:54:52,991 --> 00:55:05,376
But, you know, looking at student work and progress across the four areas and having something set up to do that regularly, I think is something that we've started on and need to continue with, if that.

463
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:06,636
make sense.

464
00:55:07,877 --> 00:55:08,237
It does.

465
00:55:08,317 --> 00:55:16,642
And I think that was kind of the goal of this of getting this group together to have this conversation is to say, what does that process look like?

466
00:55:17,342 --> 00:55:19,643
And what is the timeline for that?

467
00:55:21,104 --> 00:55:26,187
So I don't know if that becomes a question with with the strategic plan for the district.

468
00:55:26,267 --> 00:55:28,788
As we said, the phase one is coming to

469
00:55:30,737 --> 00:55:39,161
Coming to an end this year and knowing what that phase two is, is something that I can speak for myself.

470
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:49,687
I hope the rest of the subcommittee agrees we'd like to know what, as we approach the end of phase one, what does phase two look like, who's involved, and what's the timeline?

471
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,852
Yeah, I don't think there's like a definite answer for that right now.

472
00:55:57,692 --> 00:56:09,519
I definitely welcome the continued conversation in a future meeting but I know, I don't know if you want to end I can kind of show like the draft for what that process looks like.

473
00:56:09,959 --> 00:56:10,540
And I think

474
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:29,546
following that process as well as taking a deeper dive on the catalog of curricula that we have internally and in mind with your kind of like didactic structure, right?

475
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,147
Because that's the key.

476
00:56:31,407 --> 00:56:35,708
We've already well established that we have MAP growth and how it's used.

477
00:56:37,512 --> 00:56:53,948
and the importance of the instruction and fidelity to the program, but then there is the importance of that, you know, that third kind of piece of data, too, around the grade level performance, some of those internal factors that we're looking at, and observations that we conduct.

478
00:56:54,768 --> 00:56:58,772
And I think the, like the observational rounds, which have been

479
00:56:59,913 --> 00:57:02,314
very effective in pockets.

480
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:07,336
Mr. Teixeira, Mr. Tucci, and Ms.

481
00:57:07,356 --> 00:57:11,718
Khan, as well as others, but like, they've really took like a deep dive on that.

482
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:17,100
And I think, you know, that's work that we can also build.

483
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:25,103
As well as I think, you know, aligning to the Ed Reports and the curate process is,

484
00:57:25,987 --> 00:57:32,052
the Department of Education pushes high quality grade level curriculum right across the board.

485
00:57:32,652 --> 00:57:49,466
And that's very easy to kind of, I shouldn't say it's easy, but assessing grade level material when it's from a published program is one thing, but reviewing and assessing curriculum that is

486
00:57:50,623 --> 00:57:53,664
created in-house is a different process.

487
00:57:53,804 --> 00:58:03,747
And I think that's the process or some of the work that we could, that the district needs to like maybe look at too.

488
00:58:05,528 --> 00:58:18,552
Because it's very clear the process from the Department of Education when you're assessing high quality materials that have already been created by a publisher, which we have many, but assessing

489
00:58:19,341 --> 00:58:35,228
the high quality, I don't wanna say high quality ness, but the high quality grade level piece of internally created curricula is a different structure.

490
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:42,971
And I think that that's one that we could also discuss.

491
00:58:44,161 --> 00:58:47,503
what that looks like will be different than what the other process looks like.

492
00:58:47,803 --> 00:58:48,464
That makes sense.

493
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:49,785
I'm noting that it's six.

494
00:58:49,845 --> 00:58:52,446
I would love to see this draft.

495
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:54,007
Oh, yeah.

496
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:56,209
But I do notice it is the time.

497
00:58:56,229 --> 00:59:09,237
And I think, especially in those instances where we're looking at, I don't want to call them Frankenstein curricula, but to say there's a gap in this published material that we need to supplement with either something homegrown or some other published material.

498
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:19,356
Yeah, I wanted to also just note that it's not going to look the same depending on the department or the grade level.

499
00:59:20,336 --> 00:59:35,121
Because there are some guiding questions, but to Mr. Cieri's point, I loved his question about the difference between what a curriculum offers and what a curriculum expects.

500
00:59:37,222 --> 00:59:41,505
I think since this is a draft, I would love to add that into our guiding questions somewhere.

501
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:48,950
But this basically just kind of takes into account the four phases when we're looking at assessing curriculum.

502
00:59:49,531 --> 00:59:52,594
which is what happens in the planning and the review.

503
00:59:52,614 --> 01:00:09,353
I don't have to read all of it, but this first box kind of gives the snapshot of what happens during this process, which is establishing the team of stakeholders that you spoke about, Member Reinfeldt, and doing some of that preliminary work to know

504
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:22,015
what is the research saying about the current content so that the people on this team and all stakeholders kind of understand.

505
01:00:22,355 --> 01:00:35,100
So to like Dr. Keyes' point earlier, if we were doing this on like early literacy screeners, we would really want to inform this group of stakeholders what is current research saying about the science of reading.

506
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:43,894
Then the second phase is like the analysis, where we're looking at our internal data around

507
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:46,850
all those triangulation pieces.

508
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:58,119
There are some links in here of things that we would be pulling in right away from student assessments to DESE guidance, and of course, alignment to our strategic plan.

509
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:04,984
And then the next phase is like making a determination about is the curriculum meeting the needs of students?

510
01:01:05,044 --> 01:01:06,084
Do we need to move on?

511
01:01:06,104 --> 01:01:07,045
Do we need to enhance?

512
01:01:07,686 --> 01:01:09,347
Is it time to look for a new program?

513
01:01:10,354 --> 01:01:16,261
And the team would be making those decisions to chart a path forward.

514
01:01:16,822 --> 01:01:24,610
And then this is the very long part here, because it's not only the implementation, but it's the monitoring.

515
01:01:25,331 --> 01:01:28,855
And this is where we can live for like

516
01:01:29,716 --> 01:01:39,664
three to four years as we're kind of implementing a program and continuously kind of like progress monitoring it.

517
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:52,974
And I think this is where a lot of the work, per how you've kind of phrased this, you would like to live in kind of like this section of the work.

518
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:56,772
Yeah, although I will say I love the reasons for initiation.

519
01:01:56,832 --> 01:02:03,535
I think that's really important to make explicit that some of it is scheduled, some of it is emerging.

520
01:02:04,175 --> 01:02:04,376
Right.

521
01:02:05,036 --> 01:02:06,637
And some of it is external.

522
01:02:07,677 --> 01:02:09,238
Yes, yes, beyond our control.

523
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,078
Yeah.

524
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,901
And do you have a target timeline for this process from adoption to?

525
01:02:19,442 --> 01:02:21,063
Are you talking about for this draft?

526
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:27,265
For these stages, you said we could spend a few years in implementation and monitoring.

527
01:02:28,325 --> 01:02:28,745
Is there?

528
01:02:29,265 --> 01:02:32,026
Well, I think this is like the crosswalk of this.

529
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:37,887
To this, like I almost view this a little bit.

530
01:02:38,507 --> 01:02:38,788
Right.

531
01:02:39,348 --> 01:02:42,288
So it's going to look different at each level.

532
01:02:42,608 --> 01:02:42,868
Right.

533
01:02:43,249 --> 01:02:44,349
Within each department.

534
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:45,089
So.

535
01:02:46,266 --> 01:03:13,991
I think that's part of the work that we're all doing internally, but I think that I would like to work on firming this up with the administration, the school and department leaders, as well as kind of narrowing in a little bit more on this so that we can see what the, eventually I think we need to also have like,

536
01:03:15,231 --> 01:03:24,133
something posted, right, so that it's very clear on our website, year by year, where we are.

537
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:33,274
So like 2024, if it was up on our website, we could see that this is, you know, year two at the elementary level, it's year two for math.

538
01:03:33,454 --> 01:03:38,135
It's year four for FOSS, I think, Rocco, four or five, four.

539
01:03:38,155 --> 01:03:43,716
I think it's five, my daughter was in second grade and my other one's in third now, so.

540
01:03:44,406 --> 01:03:46,007
Okay.

541
01:03:47,147 --> 01:03:49,548
And it's year one for inter-reading, right?

542
01:03:50,609 --> 01:03:58,633
And I think we need to be able to build that so that there is a clear understanding of where we are.

543
01:03:58,653 --> 01:04:04,516
I mean, there is, you know, you can't go on the Department of Education, but they only list

544
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:07,400
reading math and science.

545
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:09,343
And I don't think it's fully up to date.

546
01:04:09,884 --> 01:04:10,345
It's not.

547
01:04:10,385 --> 01:04:12,047
That's right.

548
01:04:12,588 --> 01:04:13,409
We have to update it.

549
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:17,456
But I think there should be something on our website as well.

550
01:04:17,915 --> 01:04:18,055
Yeah.

551
01:04:18,195 --> 01:04:18,315
Yeah.

552
01:04:18,335 --> 01:04:32,746
And I think it's useful for this, if not the subcommittee or even the entire school committee to know when is it reasonable to say, all right, into readings been in place now, we need this up, we need an update on whether it's achieved its goals or not.

553
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:34,968
Cause I know school committee approves.

554
01:04:35,128 --> 01:04:40,372
We don't teach, we don't tell teachers how to teach, but we do approve major investments in curricula.

555
01:04:41,512 --> 01:04:47,114
And so knowing when it's reasonable to see those updates, that data, those data.

556
01:04:47,995 --> 01:04:49,735
I know people argue about that.

557
01:04:49,775 --> 01:04:51,996
Best practice is a five to six year cycle.

558
01:04:52,016 --> 01:04:52,116
Yeah.

559
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:58,699
And so mapping out where those are for the various curricula.

560
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:02,160
So to that point, we should be looking at FOS

561
01:05:05,723 --> 01:05:11,527
That should be one of the next focus areas for elementary.

562
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:19,754
But I want to be able to like create that cycle so that we can see on a yearly basis where we are.

563
01:05:19,774 --> 01:05:25,358
And I think that would be very helpful.

564
01:05:26,803 --> 01:05:28,464
have anything to add.

565
01:05:28,484 --> 01:05:28,644
Did.

566
01:05:29,824 --> 01:05:31,285
Anyone else have anything to add?

567
01:05:31,325 --> 01:05:43,970
I know this was kind of a preliminary meeting, and it was for many of you laying out some of the things that you've been already working on for a couple of new school committee members, but it is very much appreciated, especially after hours.

568
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:47,011
Um member Brandly or member member Russo.

569
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:47,631
Did you have any other

570
01:05:56,859 --> 01:05:57,600
I took my notes.

571
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,481
You guys are rock stars.

572
01:06:02,082 --> 01:06:02,602
Thank you.

573
01:06:03,383 --> 01:06:04,103
So I think I am.

574
01:06:04,363 --> 01:06:04,784
Oh, go ahead.

575
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:10,127
So I'm excited.

576
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:17,531
I'm excited to see this, this next stage of the process laid out and to understand where we are with the various curricula so that we can

577
01:06:19,502 --> 01:06:28,584
We can come to you when it is appropriate and not make extra work asking questions and when they're not, when the answer is forthcoming.

578
01:06:28,604 --> 01:06:31,464
Absolutely.

579
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:39,726
Thank you.

580
01:06:41,466 --> 01:06:46,547
Brandly, Member Russo, is there- Can we go to a door?

581
01:06:49,371 --> 01:06:50,152
Motion to adjourn.

582
01:06:50,232 --> 01:06:51,033
Is there a second?

583
01:06:51,733 --> 01:06:52,033
Second.
