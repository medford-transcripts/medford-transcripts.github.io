01:34:40,506 --> 01:34:42,447
[SPEAKER_24]: And number five, we have reports of committees.

102
01:34:42,628 --> 01:34:45,570
[SPEAKER_24]: First up is Curriculum Subcommittee from February 24th, 2021.

103
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:50,814
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Paula van de Kloet.

104
01:34:51,274 --> 01:35:01,362
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, so this is a very extensive, it was an extensive meeting, so I'm going to condense the minutes for the purpose of just sort of summarizing the meeting.

105
01:35:02,223 --> 01:35:04,163
[SPEAKER_27]: We had two presentations that evening.

106
01:35:04,884 --> 01:35:09,064
[SPEAKER_27]: The first was from Molly Leighton, director of our technology.

107
01:35:09,984 --> 01:35:13,825
[SPEAKER_27]: She spoke to the curriculum and what's covered in each of the grade levels.

108
01:35:15,385 --> 01:35:21,166
[SPEAKER_27]: She also spoke to questions like, what are her future goals?

109
01:35:22,527 --> 01:35:30,468
[SPEAKER_27]: She wants to expand the library makerspace, expansion of student tech help desks, bring girls who code club

110
01:35:31,384 --> 01:35:34,025
[SPEAKER_27]: Medford Public Schools and build course pathways.

111
01:35:35,226 --> 01:35:40,588
[SPEAKER_27]: Full-time librarians in all schools with certified school librarian tech integration leaders.

112
01:35:42,408 --> 01:35:45,910
[SPEAKER_27]: She did note that the department is light.

113
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:52,933
[SPEAKER_27]: Part of that, of course, is due to the tragic death of a staff member.

114
01:35:56,289 --> 01:36:10,497
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the things that she also spoke of about was that computer skills, it's not just the computer classes, but also embedding skills within the curriculum across the board.

115
01:36:13,398 --> 01:36:15,539
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's not a standalone.

116
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:23,043
[SPEAKER_27]: So example, writing on the computer, for example, using a slideshow to present a science project.

117
01:36:23,598 --> 01:36:32,643
[SPEAKER_27]: Tech teachers had to teach proficiently with keyboards for MCAS, use it throughout the day, and now extremely important that everyone has a Chromebook.

118
01:36:32,763 --> 01:36:35,124
[SPEAKER_27]: So member Graham asked about a new curriculum.

119
01:36:38,186 --> 01:36:38,346
[SPEAKER_27]: Ms.

120
01:36:38,386 --> 01:36:39,627
[SPEAKER_27]: Layden said, I don't think so.

121
01:36:39,807 --> 01:36:46,891
[SPEAKER_27]: So this year and last year, we have supported staff and students how to use Google Classrooms, emails, online research tools.

122
01:36:47,371 --> 01:36:50,573
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of those things will continue to evolve depending on needs.

123
01:36:51,073 --> 01:36:53,034
[SPEAKER_27]: More a skill set than a set curriculum.

124
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:00,374
[SPEAKER_27]: Ms.

125
01:37:00,434 --> 01:37:04,316
[SPEAKER_27]: Layden talked about the influx of tech funding, which of course was a positive.

126
01:37:06,637 --> 01:37:09,438
[SPEAKER_27]: And I asked about how do we support our classroom teachers?

127
01:37:09,838 --> 01:37:14,980
[SPEAKER_27]: Are we doing enough to support our teachers in areas they don't feel comfortable with Google Classroom, et cetera?

128
01:37:17,382 --> 01:37:17,542
[SPEAKER_27]: Ms.

129
01:37:17,582 --> 01:37:25,165
[SPEAKER_27]: Layden responded that library and tech teachers work hand in hand with classmates, teachers reinforcing and assisting when needed.

130
01:37:30,468 --> 01:37:38,874
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, she went back and talked about the library staff is stretched thin and this of course has ramifications for what they can accomplish.

131
01:37:41,915 --> 01:37:43,356
[SPEAKER_27]: So I would sum that up.

132
01:37:46,061 --> 01:37:52,644
[SPEAKER_27]: I asked about the other things that we need as a committee to be aware of for budget requests.

133
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:59,448
[SPEAKER_27]: And she said, the ordered Chrome tables for kindergarten finally arrived, as did the document cameras for teachers.

134
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,909
[SPEAKER_27]: So those were very delayed in arriving, but they're finally here.

135
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:06,731
[SPEAKER_27]: Instructional labs will need upgrading for coding.

136
01:38:07,712 --> 01:38:10,453
[SPEAKER_27]: We would look to build in a replacement budget for the future.

137
01:38:13,618 --> 01:38:20,843
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, the next presentation was by Dr. Riccadeli, who spoke to us about the world language curriculum.

138
01:38:22,624 --> 01:38:32,871
[SPEAKER_27]: Much of this discussion really focused on the middle school level and whether French should be added as an option.

139
01:38:33,571 --> 01:38:34,932
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a great deal of interest.

140
01:38:35,333 --> 01:38:36,894
[SPEAKER_27]: I think one of the points which,

141
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:50,799
[SPEAKER_27]: I saw some level of where it wasn't fully decided as Dr. Riccadeli was suggesting that it would start off with grade six next year to offer French.

142
01:38:51,359 --> 01:39:06,629
[SPEAKER_27]: She suggested that we have staff who's already able to speak French, but I know that there was also expressed by member Graham, any interest in having that extended at least into grade seven and possibly grade eight.

143
01:39:09,025 --> 01:39:10,125
[SPEAKER_27]: We adjourned at 530.

144
01:39:11,066 --> 01:39:14,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to approve.

145
01:39:16,329 --> 01:39:18,771

[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

157
01:39:40,141 --> 01:39:40,921
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Van der Kloot?

158
01:39:41,261 --> 01:39:41,501
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

159
01:39:42,882 --> 01:39:43,602
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

160
01:39:44,262 --> 01:39:44,482
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

161
01:39:44,842 --> 01:39:46,323
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of the affirmatives are in the negative.

162
01:39:46,383 --> 01:39:47,223
[SPEAKER_24]: Minutes are approved.

163
01:39:47,783 --> 01:39:50,964
[SPEAKER_24]: Number two, we have committee of the whole meeting, March 1st, 2021.

164
01:39:52,845 --> 01:40:00,047
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, recommendation to approve evaluation of Superintendent Maurice-Edouard Vincent for the school year 2019-2020.

165
01:40:00,067 --> 01:40:04,448
[SPEAKER_24]: At this meeting, we just discussed the evaluation

166
01:40:07,606 --> 01:40:11,169
[SPEAKER_24]: with Dr. Edouard-Vincent, who got amazing scores.

167
01:40:11,929 --> 01:40:13,310
[SPEAKER_24]: We ask her to keep up the good work.

168
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:15,812
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion for approval of those minutes?

169
01:40:16,172 --> 01:40:16,912
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion to approve.

170
01:40:16,932 --> 01:40:19,074

[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz.

172

01:40:25,378 --> 01:40:25,998
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Graham?

174
01:40:26,519 --> 01:40:26,759
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

175
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:28,340
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Kreatz?

176
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:28,900

01:40:33,503 --> 01:40:34,204
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau?

181
01:40:35,525 --> 01:40:35,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_24]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

184
01:40:46,481 --> 01:40:47,301
[SPEAKER_24]: Minutes are approved.

185
01:40:47,621 --> 01:40:54,385
[SPEAKER_24]: Number 3, communications stakeholder engagement in strategic planning subcommittee meeting, March 2, 2021.

186
01:40:55,025 --> 01:40:56,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Jenny Graham, chair.

187
01:40:59,364 --> 01:41:00,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, thanks.

188
01:41:00,825 --> 01:41:14,470
[SPEAKER_18]: So we met on the 2nd of March, and the topics that we covered were really around infusing some community engagement into the work that the district has been doing to craft a strategic plan.

189
01:41:15,631 --> 01:41:20,393
[SPEAKER_18]: We reviewed a plan and some options to host

190
01:41:22,614 --> 01:41:39,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Roundtables in early April, and we wanna target the week of April 5th, and we would be hosting two roundtables, and the superintendent will circulate information about the details of that.

191
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:49,943
[SPEAKER_18]: But the roundtables would operate much like the roundtables we did back last spring, where we were talking about the reopening of school.

192
01:41:50,983 --> 01:42:07,231
[SPEAKER_18]: and but would be focused on questions around the vision of where and the direction of the district so that that community input could be pulled into the strategic planning work that is already underway.

193
01:42:08,231 --> 01:42:10,732
[SPEAKER_18]: So we talked about having two 90 minute sessions.

194
01:42:11,973 --> 01:42:18,376
[SPEAKER_18]: One would start at five and one would start at 630 just to provide some small timing shifts for families.

195
01:42:19,496 --> 01:42:35,168
[SPEAKER_18]: There'll be breakout rooms at each of the roundtable that will sort of operate identically and focus on the different levels and classifications of folks who may be interested in joining and have something to say specific to elementary or middle school, high school.

196
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:45,536
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked about a breakout room for our special education families, and we also talked about

197
01:42:47,196 --> 01:42:50,518
[SPEAKER_18]: breakout rooms for those who need translations much like we did in the spring.

198
01:42:51,818 --> 01:43:00,343
[SPEAKER_18]: In thinking about all of that I would also suggest that we have one for teachers because they'll be critical to whatever strategic plans are put into place.

199
01:43:00,403 --> 01:43:06,946
[SPEAKER_18]: So at the meeting we talked about the sort of structure of the roundtables that would occur

200
01:43:07,586 --> 01:43:31,999
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we talked about a survey that the district would send out at the conclusion of the roundtable in late April so that we collect even yet more information from the families in the community about the strategic plan so that, you know, attendance at the meeting is not a requirement in order to provide input on

201
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:40,082
[SPEAKER_18]: the overall information that we are looking to see as part of the strategic plan.

202
01:43:41,042 --> 01:43:58,306
[SPEAKER_18]: And then from there, the administration will take all of that information and assimilate it with much of the work they have been doing and has been underway for over a year now, although halted by the pandemic, with still a goal that we will look at that strategic plan in detail in

203
01:43:59,186 --> 01:44:03,031
[SPEAKER_18]: June of this year so that we can begin to implement and execute against it.

204
01:44:05,914 --> 01:44:20,269
[SPEAKER_18]: So again the roundtables would will be sort of penciled in for the week of April 6th, April 5th and the communication subcommittee meeting that's scheduled for that week will be canceled so that we can make space for the

205
01:44:21,652 --> 01:44:22,332
[SPEAKER_18]: for the roundtables.

206
01:44:22,532 --> 01:44:29,394
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the survey draft will go out as somewhat contingent on some of the initial feedback from the roundtables.

207
01:44:29,854 --> 01:44:36,396
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we'll go out around April vacation and have a couple of week turnaround time for folks to think and respond.

208
01:44:37,456 --> 01:44:38,457
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's it.

209
01:44:39,217 --> 01:44:39,837
[SPEAKER_24]: Wonderful job.

210
01:44:40,297 --> 01:44:43,258
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval by member McLaughlin, seconded by?

211
01:44:43,278 --> 01:44:43,398
[SPEAKER_24]: Second.

212
01:44:45,058 --> 01:44:46,239
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Kreatz, roll call.

213
01:44:47,293 --> 01:44:47,873
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Graham?

214
01:44:48,273 --> 01:44:48,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

215
01:44:49,634 --> 01:44:50,194
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Kreatz?

216
01:44:50,954 --> 01:44:51,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

217
01:44:52,474 --> 01:44:53,575
[SPEAKER_20]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

218
01:44:53,935 --> 01:44:54,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Mustone?

219
01:44:55,915 --> 01:44:56,175
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

220
01:44:57,816 --> 01:44:58,476
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau?

221
01:44:59,376 --> 01:44:59,596
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

222
01:45:00,856 --> 01:45:01,717
[SPEAKER_20]: Member van der Kloot?

223
01:45:02,097 --> 01:45:02,317
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

224
01:45:03,517 --> 01:45:04,237
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

225
01:45:05,118 --> 01:45:05,378
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

226
01:45:05,438 --> 01:45:07,058
[SPEAKER_24]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

227
01:45:07,358 --> 01:45:08,238
[SPEAKER_24]: Minutes are approved.

228
01:45:09,499 --> 01:45:13,660
[SPEAKER_24]: Next, we have number four, building and ground subcommittee meeting, March 3rd, 2021.

229
01:45:15,641 --> 01:45:18,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Kathy Kreatz, who is the chair.

230
01:45:19,844 --> 01:45:20,344
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Kreatz.

231
01:45:20,984 --> 01:45:21,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

232
01:45:21,865 --> 01:45:23,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also going to summarize my meeting minutes.

233
01:45:24,706 --> 01:45:27,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've condensed them to just about two pages.

234
01:45:28,048 --> 01:45:29,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be brief, as can be.

235
01:45:29,889 --> 01:45:32,351
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a building and grounds meeting on March 3rd.

236
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:35,993
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the topics we discussed was the high school generator.

237
01:45:36,013 --> 01:45:38,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I shared the specs with everybody via email.

238
01:45:39,055 --> 01:45:41,096
[SPEAKER_05]: We received the specs from Gone Green.

239
01:45:41,256 --> 01:45:42,517
[SPEAKER_05]: The total estimate is 186,925.

240
01:45:45,586 --> 01:45:49,288
[SPEAKER_05]: John McLaughlin informed the committee, it's very important to replace the generator.

241
01:45:49,508 --> 01:45:52,971
[SPEAKER_05]: There were two generators at Medford High School, one in the front and one in the back of the building.

242
01:45:53,451 --> 01:45:57,173
[SPEAKER_05]: The one on the vocational side is the one that failed.

243
01:45:57,493 --> 01:46:01,336
[SPEAKER_05]: If we had a power event in the winter, we could have problems with the pipes freezing.

244
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,317
[SPEAKER_05]: We got an update from John McLaughlin after the meeting.

245
01:46:04,497 --> 01:46:05,578
[SPEAKER_05]: He shared an email with us.

246
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:11,802
[SPEAKER_05]: He spoke to the contractor about the life expectancy of the spec that we got for the new generator.

247
01:46:12,202 --> 01:46:14,624
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be 20 years with proper maintenance.

248
01:46:15,544 --> 01:46:21,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Murphy informed us he met with procurement officials last week regarding the need to go through bidding process for the repairs.

249
01:46:21,469 --> 01:46:24,451
[SPEAKER_05]: The generator is a capital expense and not an operating cost.

250
01:46:24,891 --> 01:46:25,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Russo and Ms.

251
01:46:25,812 --> 01:46:31,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot expressed, while we have to struggle with priorities, we don't want to be in a situation where the pipes could burst.

252
01:46:31,376 --> 01:46:33,478
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to avoid the huge emergency costs.

253
01:46:34,478 --> 01:46:36,080
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a vote taken on the floor.

254
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:43,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I motioned to consider the generator as a high priority item at the upcoming Committee of the Whole meeting on March 22nd.

255
01:46:44,226 --> 01:46:46,188
[SPEAKER_05]: It was seconded by Paulette Van der Kloot.

256
01:46:46,308 --> 01:46:48,950
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor in the motion passed.

257
01:46:49,691 --> 01:46:56,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor, I just wanted to know, do we need to take that motion on the floor this evening or will that be okay for the Committee of the Whole meeting?

258
01:47:00,879 --> 01:47:03,660
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take the vote on the floor, just to confirm.

259
01:47:05,862 --> 01:47:14,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So I motion to consider the generator as a high priority item at the upcoming committee of the whole meeting on March 22nd.

260
01:47:14,226 --> 01:47:14,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

261
01:47:19,809 --> 01:47:23,471
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval by member Kreatz, seconded by member Rousseau.

262
01:47:23,991 --> 01:47:24,552
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call.

263
01:47:24,952 --> 01:47:25,572
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Graham.

264
01:47:26,713 --> 01:47:26,893
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

265
01:47:28,376 --> 01:47:29,377
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Kreatz?

266
01:47:29,797 --> 01:47:29,997
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

267
01:47:31,878 --> 01:47:32,639
[SPEAKER_20]: Member McLaughlin?

268
01:47:32,659 --> 01:47:32,979
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

269
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,380
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Mustone?

270
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:34,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

271
01:47:36,021 --> 01:47:36,802
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau?

272
01:47:37,262 --> 01:47:37,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

273
01:47:38,763 --> 01:47:39,564
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Van der Kloot?

274
01:47:39,924 --> 01:47:40,144
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

275
01:47:41,365 --> 01:47:42,106
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor Long-O'Connor?

276
01:47:42,646 --> 01:47:42,866
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

277
01:47:42,946 --> 01:47:44,407
[SPEAKER_24]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

278
01:47:44,947 --> 01:47:45,528
[SPEAKER_24]: Paper passes.

279
01:47:46,732 --> 01:47:47,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

280
01:47:47,633 --> 01:47:56,681
[SPEAKER_05]: After we revisited the discussion about the high school entrance there with three separate projects we talked about ramp at the front of the high school sign in beautification.

281
01:47:57,081 --> 01:47:59,464
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a well thought discussion about the high school ramp.

282
01:47:59,904 --> 01:48:01,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone in attendance shared feedback.

283
01:48:01,866 --> 01:48:08,352
[SPEAKER_05]: The project is a capital project and it will require structural engineer to do the drawings to get an idea of the scope of the project.

284
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:11,674
[SPEAKER_05]: to make the ramp ADA compliant is very expensive.

285
01:48:12,075 --> 01:48:19,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Cles Andreessen, who is an architect and parent, let us know legally we either leave it as is or do the whole project.

286
01:48:20,162 --> 01:48:28,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Murphy stated it would be best if we brought forth a suite of recommendations, including the front entrance, the generator, and more to the committee to discuss.

287
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:33,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, this may need authorization from the city on some improvements.

288
01:48:34,033 --> 01:48:36,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, we discussed a sign for the Merritt High School entrance.

289
01:48:37,336 --> 01:48:44,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, Chris Donovan, parent, shared an idea of a picture idea we had for a sign of the 50th birthday celebration.

290
01:48:45,583 --> 01:48:55,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned it would be a great idea if the vocational students could assist with the sign in either one of the shops, metal fabrication or robotic shop, with their laser plasma cutter.

291
01:48:57,014 --> 01:48:58,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Cushing shared another idea.

292
01:48:59,476 --> 01:49:04,519
[SPEAKER_05]: With Groton-Dunstable, they have a mesh banner that would be cost-effective for us.

293
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,663
[SPEAKER_05]: It would beautify the building in the short term and allow us to continue with the improvement of the front entrance.

294
01:49:10,303 --> 01:49:16,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edouard-Maurice remarked, with so much concrete, there are opportunities to add enhancements.

295
01:49:16,388 --> 01:49:19,110
[SPEAKER_05]: She pointed out it's difficult to know where the front of the school is.

296
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:23,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever the wording could be, we could work with the vocational students.

297
01:49:23,914 --> 01:49:35,426
[SPEAKER_05]: The picture that was shared does show a true front entrance and official main entrance, even if it would be the short time, a new sign landscaping would be the superintendent's recommended priority.

298
01:49:36,187 --> 01:49:47,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward Maurice did a check-in with Mr. Fallon while we were in the meeting, and the vocational student shops do have a machine that would make the sign doable.

299
01:49:47,811 --> 01:49:50,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Fallon will figure out a cost and give us an estimate.

300
01:49:51,332 --> 01:49:52,952
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another vote taken on the floor.

301
01:49:53,433 --> 01:49:59,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Van der Kloot motioned to contact Mr. Fallon to get a price on these improvements.

302
01:49:59,715 --> 01:50:03,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, she would like to get the cost estimate of the banner for the front.

303
01:50:04,476 --> 01:50:07,077
[SPEAKER_05]: exploring the front entranceway banner.

304
01:50:07,517 --> 01:50:13,919
[SPEAKER_05]: On the side building, it's behind the theater where that concrete section expands.

305
01:50:14,599 --> 01:50:22,122
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, I am making that motion on the floor this evening so that we can put those estimates forth.

306
01:50:26,121 --> 01:50:27,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you please restate the motion?

307
01:50:27,842 --> 01:50:28,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

308
01:50:28,563 --> 01:50:28,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

309
01:50:28,943 --> 01:50:29,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no problem.

310
01:50:30,604 --> 01:50:30,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

311
01:50:30,864 --> 01:50:46,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Van der Kloot motioned to contact principal Chad Fallon to get a price estimate on the improvements for the lettering on the front of the front entrance of the school and also to get a cost estimate on the banner for the front of the school.

312
01:50:46,635 --> 01:50:56,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're thinking, you know, the banner, if we could get an estimate on the banner for the cement and a banner for the front entrance, just so that we can do a cost comparison.

313
01:50:57,861 --> 01:51:00,162
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, if I may just comment on that.

314
01:51:00,522 --> 01:51:07,623
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't support a banner as a way to welcome our ninth through 12th grade class.

315
01:51:07,643 --> 01:51:12,524
[SPEAKER_24]: We're hoping to get this before the start of the new school year.

316
01:51:12,644 --> 01:51:21,046
[SPEAKER_24]: And I truly feel that we need a real sign as a way to welcome our students back to school.

317
01:51:21,186 --> 01:51:25,007
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think a banner will do it in my opinion.

318
01:51:25,087 --> 01:51:25,687
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know we

319
01:51:26,246 --> 01:51:37,331
[SPEAKER_24]: were able to come up with the $816,000 that was left over from the science labs, as well as I think it was 112,000 from the old boiler project.

320
01:51:39,051 --> 01:51:41,312
[SPEAKER_24]: So I can't support a banner.

321
01:51:41,973 --> 01:51:44,714
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if we... Member Van der Kloot.

322
01:51:45,305 --> 01:51:49,667
[SPEAKER_27]: So I always think that we had a discussion about sort of two different things.

323
01:51:50,168 --> 01:52:00,693
[SPEAKER_27]: One was the front entrance and doing that with a sign and nice, as our community member presented.

324
01:52:00,793 --> 01:52:02,434
[SPEAKER_27]: The other was the,

325
01:52:05,986 --> 01:52:19,208
[SPEAKER_27]: looking into a banner that might go along the whole front of the building, just to be, add a little bit more sparkle, if you would, a little bit more, you know, interest in it.

326
01:52:19,869 --> 01:52:29,010
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think right now we were getting to the point where it was just final, this is what we would do, but because there were cost concerns, like how much is a banner?

327
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:33,191
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that the, you know, from my point of view, I was definitely interested in

328
01:52:33,991 --> 01:52:39,754
[SPEAKER_27]: making the front of the school clear, clear cut, name, nice, whatever.

329
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:51,019
[SPEAKER_27]: But if the banner is a not too expensive way of also bringing some excitement to the building, I think we should look into it.

330
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:53,440
[SPEAKER_27]: So just to get a price.

331
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:57,242
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, just to get a price, just to have an understanding of what we're talking about.

332
01:52:58,035 --> 01:52:58,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kreatz?

333
01:52:58,936 --> 01:53:00,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, some point of information.

334
01:53:00,917 --> 01:53:18,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if I read it clearly, but so the first part of the motion was to contact Principal Fallon to ask if he could get an estimate on the lettering that was in the picture that I shared.

335
01:53:18,728 --> 01:53:23,551
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't be like, we haven't decided on the lettering and what's gonna go on the lettering,

336
01:53:24,011 --> 01:53:28,214
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it be Medford High School or Mustang Pride.

337
01:53:28,254 --> 01:53:35,678
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just an idea that was shared with me because I'm the chairperson of the Building and Ground Subcommittee.

338
01:53:35,979 --> 01:53:38,220
[SPEAKER_05]: That particular picture had lettering.

339
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:50,548
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like it was made out of sheet metal and the equipment that the two shops that I had mentioned, which was the robotics and automation and the metal fabrication shops,

340
01:53:51,689 --> 01:53:54,232
[SPEAKER_05]: They do have a laser and a plasma cutter.

341
01:53:54,892 --> 01:54:11,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those two machines, I believe, it might be possible for the vocational shops and or teachers and students possibly to create that lettering sign which would go on the

342
01:54:12,113 --> 01:54:16,576
[SPEAKER_05]: front of the front entrance high school where you go up on the ramp.

343
01:54:17,137 --> 01:54:27,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the idea that Mr. Cushing was sharing with us had to do with the large concrete section that is behind the Caron Theater.

344
01:54:28,245 --> 01:54:32,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So all that concrete to brighten up that area

345
01:54:34,509 --> 01:54:56,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Cushing shared an idea of having a banner that might look nice, you know, to cover up the concrete and it might have, you know, we just talked about ideas like having Mustangs running or maybe Mustang Pride could go there with some Mustangs and then the lettering would be on the front of the school with maybe Medford High School so that there's a distinct

346
01:54:57,066 --> 01:55:16,113
[SPEAKER_05]: front entrance and um I did I did ask about this um the lettering you know would be I believe would be able to take him down if we were to you know have either the vocational students do it or an outside company and that lettering could be then put on you know

347
01:55:16,753 --> 01:55:31,325
[SPEAKER_05]: a renovation in another area, if at some time, maybe five to 10 years from now, there is a full renovation, but the structure of the building itself is sound, so they might keep the original structure.

348
01:55:33,086 --> 01:55:44,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think that the estimates are for getting prices on those so that at our next meeting, we can talk about the next part of the plan,

349
01:55:48,663 --> 01:55:49,444
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Member Kreatz.

350
01:55:50,344 --> 01:55:53,866
[SPEAKER_24]: So is there a motion for approval to just get estimates?

351
01:55:55,848 --> 01:55:59,090
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to approve by Member Van der Kloot, seconded by?

352
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:00,170
[SPEAKER_24]: Second.

353
01:56:00,791 --> 01:56:01,951
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Ruseau, roll call?

354
01:56:04,733 --> 01:56:05,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Graham?

355
01:56:06,434 --> 01:56:06,674
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

356
01:56:07,835 --> 01:56:08,435
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Kreatz?

357
01:56:09,016 --> 01:56:09,256
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

358
01:56:10,177 --> 01:56:11,257
[SPEAKER_20]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

359
01:56:11,317 --> 01:56:12,078
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Mustone?

360
01:56:13,559 --> 01:56:13,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

361
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:16,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau?

362
01:56:17,001 --> 01:56:17,181
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

363
01:56:18,308 --> 01:56:19,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Van der Kloot?

364
01:56:19,469 --> 01:56:19,689
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

365
01:56:20,869 --> 01:56:21,570
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor Longo-Klein?

366
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:24,751
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, paper passes.

367
01:56:26,052 --> 01:56:27,913
[SPEAKER_24]: Number six, community participation.

368
01:56:28,233 --> 01:56:36,978
[SPEAKER_24]: Public participation emails, questions, or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

369
01:56:37,558 --> 01:56:44,021
[SPEAKER_24]: Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford street address, your question or comment.

370
01:56:44,902 --> 01:56:45,582
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Van der Kloot?

371
01:56:46,089 --> 01:56:48,509
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, there were four altogether.

372
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:52,370
[SPEAKER_27]: The first one I'm going to read has to do with MCAS.

373
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:57,431
[SPEAKER_27]: It was submitted by Eileen Manziel of 42 Winter Street.

374
01:56:57,791 --> 01:57:01,372
[SPEAKER_27]: She writes, question, what are the new dates for MCAS testing?

375
01:57:01,772 --> 01:57:05,772
[SPEAKER_27]: Are parents still able to opt out their child children if they so choose?

376
01:57:06,153 --> 01:57:07,993
[SPEAKER_27]: Sincerely, Eileen Manziel.

377
01:57:13,714 --> 01:57:14,314
[SPEAKER_24]: Dr. Cushing.

378
01:57:15,732 --> 01:57:22,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So we actually just received the commissioner's update today, just a little while ago that testing for grades.

379
01:57:24,117 --> 01:57:26,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me pull it up here actually, because it literally just came in.

380
01:57:26,959 --> 01:57:36,024
[SPEAKER_08]: The testing for MCAS for grades three through eight testing schedule has been postponed.

381
01:57:36,064 --> 01:57:43,669
[SPEAKER_08]: The updated tentative testing windows for grades three through five have been changed to Monday, May 10th through Friday, June 11th.

382
01:57:44,594 --> 01:57:48,536
[SPEAKER_08]: for the tests in ELA, mathematics, science, technology, engineering.

383
01:57:49,336 --> 01:57:53,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Testing dates are still yet to be determined for grades six through eight.

384
01:57:53,879 --> 01:57:55,540
[SPEAKER_08]: That just came in this evening.

385
01:57:56,980 --> 01:58:14,049
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as opt-out, there's no official opt-out, but we had said earlier, DESE doesn't allow an opt-out, but we had said earlier that the best way for parents to let the educators know, the principal know, is to submit an email

386
01:58:14,955 --> 01:58:15,936
[SPEAKER_08]: and reach out.

387
01:58:16,116 --> 01:58:18,799
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also want to allow Ms.

388
01:58:18,819 --> 01:58:21,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Galussi to speak if that's okay with the chair.

389
01:58:23,665 --> 01:58:24,305
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely, Ms.

390
01:58:24,325 --> 01:58:24,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Galussi.

391
01:58:26,568 --> 01:58:28,570
[SPEAKER_33]: Dr. Cushing pretty much covered everything.

392
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:30,172
[SPEAKER_33]: He reflected the new dates.

393
01:58:30,372 --> 01:58:36,959
[SPEAKER_33]: The elementary principals had already set their MCAS schedules for April and I believe had communicated those with

394
01:58:37,808 --> 01:58:47,516
[SPEAKER_33]: families so we're now back to the drawing board for May and once those dates are finalized we'll be reporting that out.

395
01:58:48,537 --> 01:58:55,402
[SPEAKER_33]: Dr. Cushing also mentioned that if there are families since as of right now there is no remote option to take the MCAS

396
01:58:56,443 --> 01:59:00,505
[SPEAKER_33]: at least at the elementary level, with those first dates being the ones shared.

397
01:59:01,945 --> 01:59:12,730
[SPEAKER_33]: If there are parents, especially in the remote learning academy, that do not wish to have their students come to school to take MCAS, then they need to send an email to the school principal.

398
01:59:12,750 --> 01:59:15,751
[SPEAKER_33]: I hope that's helpful.

399
01:59:16,452 --> 01:59:16,872
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Ms.

400
01:59:16,892 --> 01:59:17,232
[SPEAKER_27]: Galusi.

401
01:59:18,487 --> 01:59:19,927
[SPEAKER_27]: Next email, please.

402
01:59:21,188 --> 01:59:25,169
[SPEAKER_27]: So there are three more emails regarding the Columbus School.

403
01:59:27,690 --> 01:59:29,670
[SPEAKER_27]: Mayor, do you wish me to read them now?

404
01:59:36,112 --> 01:59:41,413
[SPEAKER_24]: We have that two resolutions at the middle to end of our meeting.

405
01:59:41,493 --> 01:59:45,394
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think we should probably save them as others may want to comment as well.

406
01:59:45,954 --> 01:59:46,074
[SPEAKER_27]: OK.

407
01:59:49,083 --> 01:59:50,003
[SPEAKER_27]: what your preference is.

408
01:59:50,803 --> 01:59:51,523
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, thank you.

409
01:59:52,164 --> 01:59:53,724
[SPEAKER_27]: So, and I'll keep on checking.

410
01:59:54,584 --> 01:59:55,984
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much, Member Van der Kloot.

411
01:59:57,304 --> 01:59:59,525
[SPEAKER_24]: Next up, we have report of superintendent.

412
02:00:00,085 --> 02:00:04,166
[SPEAKER_24]: Number one is superintendents updates and comments, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

413
02:00:05,826 --> 02:00:06,426
[SPEAKER_28]: Good evening.

414
02:00:08,226 --> 02:00:17,828
[SPEAKER_28]: Today is International Women's Day, a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women.

415
02:00:18,561 --> 02:00:20,322
[SPEAKER_28]: which began in 1911.

416
02:00:22,103 --> 02:00:26,586
[SPEAKER_28]: This year, the theme is hashtag choose challenge.

417
02:00:27,186 --> 02:00:29,268
[SPEAKER_28]: From challenge comes change.

418
02:00:30,448 --> 02:00:35,872
[SPEAKER_28]: I am proud that Medford is a community that values female voices at the table.

419
02:00:36,872 --> 02:00:40,895
[SPEAKER_28]: Celebrating women's achievements only helps to forge equality.

420
02:00:43,112 --> 02:00:45,873
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, I have some positive news to share.

421
02:00:46,494 --> 02:01:04,723
[SPEAKER_28]: This week's COVID-19 testing program, we administered over 2,700 tests, and I'm pleased to report that after three days of testing, our Mustang community yielded zero positive cases.

422
02:01:06,044 --> 02:01:12,027
[SPEAKER_28]: Additionally, earlier this week, or last week, Governor Baker announced that teachers and staff

423
02:01:12,927 --> 02:01:19,274
[SPEAKER_28]: in K through 12 education and early education and care would soon be eligible to take their vaccine.

424
02:01:20,596 --> 02:01:31,848
[SPEAKER_28]: So this is a critical step, a critical next step toward restoring a sense of normalcy for our students and for all of Medford.

425
02:01:34,011 --> 02:01:55,085
[SPEAKER_28]: So with the continued decline in virus positivity rates and the stated intention of the Commissioner of Ed to soon require modification around structured learning time, we are taking active steps to prepare for the likelihood of the increase of in-person instruction.

426
02:01:57,042 --> 02:02:04,565
[SPEAKER_28]: This effort toward restoring more normalcy is an important step in helping our students to prepare for next school year.

427
02:02:05,925 --> 02:02:15,189
[SPEAKER_28]: Obviously, our hope for next year will be to open and be continuing to provide instruction for the full week.

428
02:02:16,409 --> 02:02:17,750
[SPEAKER_28]: Working towards that goal,

429
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:24,403
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, preparation will begin to take place right now.

430
02:02:24,824 --> 02:02:34,071
[SPEAKER_28]: We are continuing to wait for additional guidance this week from the commissioner regarding his announcement that was made on Friday.

431
02:02:35,132 --> 02:02:42,958
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, the focus would be to start with elementary schools and eventually stagger that out six through 12.

432
02:02:46,513 --> 02:03:07,200
[SPEAKER_28]: This week we have a time-sensitive request that we asked of the parent community of students that are in grades six through 12 that we are asking that you would confirm which cohort your child is in by this Friday, March 12th.

433
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:13,002
[SPEAKER_28]: There is an exception for remote learning due to COVID-related circumstances.

434
02:03:14,638 --> 02:03:20,620
[SPEAKER_28]: However, we do need to have accurate accounting of which cohort students are involved in.

435
02:03:21,281 --> 02:03:30,064
[SPEAKER_28]: And so, in person attendance for all students in grades six through 12, starting effective next Monday, March 15.

436
02:03:31,576 --> 02:03:48,511
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, your identification of which cohort you are in and your participation in extracurricular activities will be contingent upon the adherence to the in-person attendance and scheduling expectations for your cohort.

437
02:03:50,633 --> 02:03:55,016
[SPEAKER_28]: So this week, or this past week, I should say on Thursday,

438
02:03:55,871 --> 02:04:11,182
[SPEAKER_28]: We had the opportunity to hear from our elementary students, parents, caregivers, and members of our staff at the elementary levels regarding their expectations this year and their expectations for next year.

439
02:04:11,883 --> 02:04:13,844
[SPEAKER_28]: It was a wonderful conversation.

440
02:04:14,385 --> 02:04:21,290
[SPEAKER_28]: Many members of the school committee were able to join different portions of the listening sessions that took place.

441
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:24,693
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you, school committee members, for your support

442
02:04:26,095 --> 02:04:27,236
[SPEAKER_28]: attendance last week.

443
02:04:28,037 --> 02:04:43,949
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to remind everyone that tomorrow, March 9th, we will be holding another listening session for our middle school students, and a similar session on Thursday, March 11th, for our high school students.

444
02:04:44,769 --> 02:04:54,717
[SPEAKER_28]: We will be having similar listening sessions for all of our cohorts, A, B, C, and D, and we would like to

445
02:04:57,536 --> 02:05:05,300
[SPEAKER_28]: provide our seniors with an opportunity to be able to share their specific concerns as seniors.

446
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:10,102
[SPEAKER_28]: So March 11th, this Thursday, we want to hear from you.

447
02:05:11,342 --> 02:05:22,187
[SPEAKER_28]: Translation will be available both tomorrow and on Thursday in the following languages, Portuguese, Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Arabic.

448
02:05:23,107 --> 02:05:25,588
[SPEAKER_28]: Closed captioning is also available.

449
02:05:27,375 --> 02:05:36,341
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to take this opportunity to thank DA Marion Ryan and her amazing staff of assistant DAs.

450
02:05:37,961 --> 02:05:54,715
[SPEAKER_28]: Alia Khalidi, Doug Cannon, Catherine Folger, Adrian Lynch, Tom Ralph, Tom Brandt, Beth Dunigan, Alice Casey, and D.A.

451
02:05:54,775 --> 02:06:05,463
[SPEAKER_28]: Ryan's press director, Megan Kelly, for their important presentation on racial equity, anti-bias, and white privilege for our teachers and staff.

452
02:06:06,482 --> 02:06:12,909
[SPEAKER_28]: These difficult conversations need to be had in order for our community to be more unified.

453
02:06:13,790 --> 02:06:21,718
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate District Attorney Ryan's leadership on these issues as we continue to move forward together.

454
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:24,802
[SPEAKER_28]: I have some wonderful news to share.

455
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:27,219
[SPEAKER_28]: Math Counts.

456
02:06:28,139 --> 02:06:41,142
[SPEAKER_28]: It provides engaging math programs to middle school students of all ability levels to build confidence and improve attitudes about math and problem solving.

457
02:06:42,383 --> 02:06:53,245
[SPEAKER_28]: For only the second year, Medford's Club participated in the Math Counts Math Competition, a national middle school math competition

458
02:06:54,381 --> 02:07:02,804
[SPEAKER_28]: I am pleased to announce that Adrita Samant, a 7th grade student at the Andrews Middle School

459
02:07:03,732 --> 02:07:09,717
[SPEAKER_28]: finished in sixth place in the Math Counts Chapter Invitational.

460
02:07:10,477 --> 02:07:18,003
[SPEAKER_28]: By doing so, she has qualified for the state rounds of the competition that will take place in three weeks.

461
02:07:18,824 --> 02:07:26,050
[SPEAKER_28]: This competition began with a total of 2,000 students from all over Massachusetts.

462
02:07:26,932 --> 02:07:39,258
[SPEAKER_28]: only 300 students qualified for the chapter invitational, out of which Adrita is one of only 45 students who have qualified for the state invitational.

463
02:07:39,798 --> 02:07:42,579
[SPEAKER_28]: So I just want to say congratulations to you, Adrita.

464
02:07:43,019 --> 02:07:45,180
[SPEAKER_28]: Make us proud and try your best.

465
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:49,362
[SPEAKER_28]: We're very happy that you made this great accomplishment.

466
02:07:49,642 --> 02:07:53,184
[SPEAKER_28]: And I look forward to hearing how the competition goes.

467
02:07:55,951 --> 02:08:16,804
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, believe it or not, almost a year ago, Wednesday, March 10th, it's going to mark the one year anniversary that governor Baker issued a lockdown to stop the spread of the mysterious COVID-19 virus at the time, believe it or not, it's already been a year.

468
02:08:17,605 --> 02:08:20,207
[SPEAKER_28]: There was so much that was unknown.

469
02:08:20,267 --> 02:08:22,448
[SPEAKER_28]: Then we all assumed.

470
02:08:23,018 --> 02:08:26,160
[SPEAKER_28]: we'd be back to our regular schedules after a few weeks.

471
02:08:27,060 --> 02:08:28,841
[SPEAKER_28]: Obviously, that did not happen.

472
02:08:30,162 --> 02:08:39,467
[SPEAKER_28]: All of us have been affected in some way by the virus, whether medically, financially, educationally, and or socially.

473
02:08:40,767 --> 02:08:45,150
[SPEAKER_28]: With the advent of the vaccine, we do see normalcy returning soon.

474
02:08:45,950 --> 02:08:49,492
[SPEAKER_28]: However, we must continue to wear our masks

475
02:08:50,657 --> 02:08:54,940
[SPEAKER_28]: social distance, wash our hands, and most importantly, work together.

476
02:08:56,041 --> 02:08:59,044
[SPEAKER_28]: As I have always said, we are one district, one Medford.

477
02:08:59,824 --> 02:09:16,538
[SPEAKER_28]: As we move forward in our uncertain world, the Medford Public Schools remains dedicated to providing a safe, equitable, and consistent education for all of our students with a strong focus on social emotional health.

478
02:09:19,659 --> 02:09:29,610
[SPEAKER_28]: So later today, coming up, you're going to hear an update from our nurse, Toni Wray, on what's happening with COVID-19.

479
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:34,795
[SPEAKER_28]: And then after that, I will be announcing our poetry winners.

480
02:09:35,376 --> 02:09:38,279
[SPEAKER_28]: So that is to come, our unity poem.

481
02:09:38,699 --> 02:09:41,282
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm really excited to recognize the students

482
02:09:42,557 --> 02:09:47,319
[SPEAKER_28]: that were selected, and they will be sharing their poems with us this evening.

483
02:09:47,999 --> 02:09:50,300
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you, and those are my remarks for the day.

484
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,440
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

485
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:54,901
[SPEAKER_24]: We have member McLaughlin and member Van der Kloot.

486
02:09:57,882 --> 02:09:58,322
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

487
02:09:58,402 --> 02:10:00,583
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent for this update.

488
02:10:01,003 --> 02:10:08,726
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a question on the confirming the cohort by this Friday for the grades six through 12.

489
02:10:09,860 --> 02:10:34,534
[SPEAKER_20]: I did get a robocall about that today, and I wanted to ask more about that because I want to make sure that the community is understanding, if I'm understanding it correctly, that if you can confirm your cohort, so for instance, if you're in cohort B going in on Monday and Tuesday, and you confirm that cohort this Friday, that there's no changing that cohort.

490
02:10:35,444 --> 02:10:38,466
[SPEAKER_20]: have an option to go remote again for the rest of the year.

491
02:10:38,526 --> 02:10:40,507
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that accurate, Dr. Edward-Vincent?

492
02:10:43,529 --> 02:10:45,230
[SPEAKER_21]: You're on mute.

493
02:10:45,510 --> 02:10:45,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

494
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:48,812
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, that is accurate.

495
02:10:49,512 --> 02:11:03,480
[SPEAKER_28]: One of the observations that has been occurring, which prompted us to ask, notify parents and have them clarify what cohort their child is participating in,

496
02:11:04,956 --> 02:11:18,546
[SPEAKER_28]: because we have students who were signed up for cohorts, cohort B or cohort C, and there was inconsistent attendance and participation.

497
02:11:19,086 --> 02:11:29,053
[SPEAKER_28]: And so for the purposes of reporting to DESE and also having an accurate record of attendance and data, there were different codes.

498
02:11:29,574 --> 02:11:33,056
[SPEAKER_28]: And so students would come one week and then

499
02:11:35,431 --> 02:11:39,353
[SPEAKER_28]: go and be remote the following week and then come back another week.

500
02:11:39,373 --> 02:11:41,494
[SPEAKER_28]: So there's been a lot of inconsistency.

501
02:11:42,054 --> 02:11:47,216
[SPEAKER_28]: So this declaration of cohorts is really

502
02:11:48,928 --> 02:12:02,817
[SPEAKER_28]: mostly geared towards students that are in cohort B, cohort C, who are fluctuating back and forth between B and D or C and D. So there was a back and forth movement.

503
02:12:03,478 --> 02:12:15,126
[SPEAKER_28]: And that was, the amount of movement was concerning because we're trying to keep accurate attendance records and we need to be able to plan accordingly

504
02:12:15,626 --> 02:12:32,654
[SPEAKER_28]: And even from instructional perspectives, where the teachers were expecting a cohort to be one size, and there were X amount of students one week, and then the following week, you're left with very, very small numbers of students.

505
02:12:33,314 --> 02:12:38,077
[SPEAKER_28]: And they said, this particular week, I'm going to be a fully remote student.

506
02:12:38,457 --> 02:12:44,300
[SPEAKER_28]: So there was too much fluctuation going back and forth, and we truly needed to have

507
02:12:46,107 --> 02:12:53,889
[SPEAKER_28]: consistency and parents to also be notified and aware that this fluctuation was taking place.

508
02:12:54,469 --> 02:13:14,734
[SPEAKER_28]: So by parents making the declaration for us on this Friday, effective Monday, March 15th, when attendance is being documented and recorded, we're gonna be using that new data to have it properly reflected.

509
02:13:15,219 --> 02:13:29,323
[SPEAKER_20]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, she-her, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-

510
02:13:39,448 --> 02:13:45,370
[SPEAKER_20]: For example, you know, I just noticed, say, five absences on the last quarter, and it was like, that was a surprise.

511
02:13:45,850 --> 02:13:51,092
[SPEAKER_20]: And so previously, obviously, pre-pandemic, families would get robocalls home.

512
02:13:51,132 --> 02:13:52,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Your students are not in school today.

513
02:13:52,752 --> 02:13:56,434
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand that's not happening right now for a number of reasons.

514
02:13:56,634 --> 02:14:00,295
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, the process is part of it, I think.

515
02:14:00,735 --> 02:14:06,097
[SPEAKER_20]: So if I'm understanding correctly, the way that attendance is happening now, it's a period attendance, so whether you attend

516
02:14:06,721 --> 02:14:07,742
[SPEAKER_20]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, City of Boulder, COB.:

517
02:14:07,742 --> 02:14:08,162
[SPEAKER_20]: : An individual period.

518
02:14:08,182 --> 02:14:14,327
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the first part of the question for the unpacking and the second part of the question is that HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, City of Boulder, COB.:

519
02:14:14,327 --> 02:14:18,571
[SPEAKER_20]: : Looking towards the commissioners new HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, City of Boulder, COB.:

520
02:14:18,571 --> 02:14:24,796
[SPEAKER_20]: : Mandate, for lack of a better word of students going in person in April five days a week.

521
02:14:25,496 --> 02:14:35,785
[SPEAKER_20]: Does that mean that cohorts that were currently in person will be required to go five days a week if they were at two days a week or if they are two days a week currently

522
02:14:38,763 --> 02:14:42,685
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you say that there are two days a week currently?

523
02:14:43,425 --> 02:14:58,012
[SPEAKER_20]: So in other words, if you're in person currently in a hybrid program, and the commissioner says that students need to come back in person five days a week, will we be eliminating the hybrid program, making those in-person students five days a week?

524
02:14:58,972 --> 02:15:05,415
[SPEAKER_20]: So therefore, whatever decision parents make, Friday, February 12th, is going to be essentially

525
02:15:05,914 --> 02:15:10,473
[SPEAKER_20]: not necessarily a hybrid, but an all or nothing at some point, five days or no days.

526
02:15:10,835 --> 02:15:11,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that accurate?

527
02:15:14,106 --> 02:15:30,978
[SPEAKER_28]: once it is in place, once we receive the final guidance, because Friday evening's decision from the board meeting, we were watching it in real time as were most people when that came forward.

528
02:15:31,438 --> 02:15:36,582
[SPEAKER_28]: So once we get to the high school level, it will be the five days a week.

529
02:15:38,483 --> 02:15:38,723
[SPEAKER_28]: Right.

530
02:15:39,764 --> 02:15:41,085
[SPEAKER_20]: The high school that is making

531
02:15:41,704 --> 02:15:45,348
[SPEAKER_20]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, moderator, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her.

532
02:15:51,932 --> 02:15:58,058
[SPEAKER_28]: From an accounting perspective of being able to know who's supposed to be in the building and who is not.

533
02:15:58,478 --> 02:16:10,530
[SPEAKER_28]: We took a lot, it took a lot of time to set up the schedule to set up the cohorts to try to keep the numbers manageable and the the flip flopping that was taking place.

534
02:16:12,432 --> 02:16:22,957
[SPEAKER_28]: it just wasn't being done in a consistent, from an operational perspective, it was very difficult with accountability, I would say, even if they were showing up online.

535
02:16:23,477 --> 02:16:40,385
[SPEAKER_28]: And so again, from accurately documenting the attendance, knowing who's in the building, who was not in the building, and again, parents also saying my child's in school, cohort B or cohort C, but

536
02:16:41,573 --> 02:16:44,714
[SPEAKER_28]: that not happening on a consistent basis as well.

537
02:16:44,934 --> 02:16:56,257
[SPEAKER_28]: And Dr. Cushing or Mr. Murphy, either of you could speak to the need to have this clearly documented.

538
02:16:57,077 --> 02:17:05,719
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of the things too is we've known for about a week and a half to two weeks that the- Amber McLaughlin, then do you have a supposition?

539
02:17:06,189 --> 02:17:07,970
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, just a point of privilege if I might first.

540
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:28,242
[SPEAKER_20]: So I appreciate that, Dr. Edwin-Vincent, and I just want to clarify so that we don't have to spend a lot of time talking about the need for the consistency because I do very much understand that and I very much understand the attendance protocol that needs to be put in place and the issues with flexibility, not having the flexibility so that there's accountability.

541
02:17:28,702 --> 02:17:33,125
[SPEAKER_20]: What I don't think is necessarily made clear to families and what I want to ensure

542
02:17:33,809 --> 02:17:42,855
[SPEAKER_20]: is made clear to families and caregivers is that choosing in-person is not just choosing in-person two days a week.

543
02:17:43,315 --> 02:17:52,662
[SPEAKER_20]: It is choosing, it is leaving the option open for your five days a week in-person because that's where we're headed based on what Desi was saying.

544
02:17:52,722 --> 02:17:55,403
[SPEAKER_20]: So that part I feel like has not been made clear to families.

545
02:17:55,443 --> 02:17:59,146
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that that's really important because it's not just a matter of,

546
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:04,923
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, making a choice to go hybrid or full-on or remote.

547
02:18:05,104 --> 02:18:06,685
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, you know, there's nuance there.

548
02:18:06,725 --> 02:18:23,299
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think we have to really be able to articulate that to families in a way that is useful so that they understand that if they're making a decision for two days a week, they are making a decision for full-time in-person as well based on what DESE is currently recommending.

549
02:18:23,399 --> 02:18:24,620
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, it may be staggered.

550
02:18:24,660 --> 02:18:28,503
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand that we won't all be coming back potentially all at once,

551
02:18:29,096 --> 02:18:31,217
[SPEAKER_20]: that that needs to be made fully clear.

552
02:18:31,257 --> 02:18:34,479
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you, Dr. Cushing, for letting me have that point of privilege.

553
02:18:34,519 --> 02:18:34,859
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

554
02:18:36,900 --> 02:18:38,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

555
02:18:38,401 --> 02:18:40,863
[SPEAKER_24]: Dr. Cushing, did you have anything you wanted to add?

556
02:18:43,964 --> 02:18:52,289
[SPEAKER_08]: We've known for about a week and a half looking at where the commissioner was inferencing and the vote before the board.

557
02:18:53,321 --> 02:19:02,525
[SPEAKER_08]: And so looking at the fact that we are probably going to be told at some point this week, there was the vote that he has the authority to do this now.

558
02:19:03,386 --> 02:19:15,171
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that has not been exercised yet, but we anticipate that on April 5th, we will be told that hybrid is no longer an option for elementary.

559
02:19:15,431 --> 02:19:21,934
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at some point after that, hybrid will no longer be an option for the other grades moving forward.

560
02:19:22,899 --> 02:19:27,003
[SPEAKER_08]: There's speculation as to the timetable, but there's nothing concrete at this time.

561
02:19:27,643 --> 02:19:39,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And so in preparation for that, that move back to five days a week, what we were hoping to do is to get students into their cohorts, get them into the routine of coming in.

562
02:19:39,252 --> 02:19:48,500
[SPEAKER_08]: We've tried to be amazingly flexible with students being able to go remote because of their health situations, family health situations, whatever it may be.

563
02:19:49,264 --> 02:20:10,852
[SPEAKER_08]: But as we come back to some sort of normalcy, and I say that loosely, that we wanted to give our students that sense of commitment to the cohort days, realizing that moving forward, we might be pushing to five days.

564
02:20:11,032 --> 02:20:15,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, remote is being left on the table at this time.

565
02:20:15,914 --> 02:20:16,834
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been told that.

566
02:20:17,596 --> 02:20:29,326
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, the vote on Friday gives the commission of the power to remove these options as structured learning time at any point moving forward.

567
02:20:30,607 --> 02:20:36,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I also defer to Mr. Murphy, he's been on the calls and if anyone wants to speak as well.

568
02:20:37,833 --> 02:20:42,277
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I know this is coming up on our agenda, item number five.

569
02:20:42,357 --> 02:20:44,119
[SPEAKER_24]: So Mr. Murphy, do you wanna talk now?

570
02:20:45,618 --> 02:20:49,160
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I appreciate the teaser for item number five, and I hope everyone stays tuned.

571
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:52,642
[SPEAKER_23]: And we'll try to keep it concise when number five does come around.

572
02:20:53,842 --> 02:20:54,202
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

573
02:20:56,784 --> 02:20:57,024
[SPEAKER_27]: Mayor?

574
02:20:57,724 --> 02:20:58,725
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, Member Van der Kloot.

575
02:20:59,145 --> 02:21:03,087
[SPEAKER_27]: So I do need to let you know that we received a letter on this topic.

576
02:21:03,927 --> 02:21:08,229
[SPEAKER_27]: I can hold it until the presentation, if that would be preferable.

577
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:10,190
[SPEAKER_24]: Please, for number five.

578
02:21:10,350 --> 02:21:10,791
[SPEAKER_24]: That'd be great.

579
02:21:11,151 --> 02:21:11,291
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

580
02:21:14,424 --> 02:21:25,239
[SPEAKER_24]: Number two, we just have a COVID-19 public health update and Medford Public School COVID-19 testing summary and update and vaccine update from nurse supervisor, Ms.

581
02:21:25,279 --> 02:21:25,780
[SPEAKER_24]: Toni Ray.

582
02:21:26,621 --> 02:21:29,966
[SPEAKER_24]: And also Mr. Murphy's here to speak on this as well.

583
02:21:31,186 --> 02:21:32,147
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening, everyone.

584
02:21:32,687 --> 02:21:37,991
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm happy to report positive information from the city of Medford's COVID data.

585
02:21:38,672 --> 02:21:42,115
[SPEAKER_31]: Our average daily incidence rate has been decreasing steadily.

586
02:21:42,375 --> 02:21:47,118
[SPEAKER_31]: And this week we are down to 16.7 cases per 100,000.

587
02:21:47,879 --> 02:21:53,964
[SPEAKER_31]: So this rate maintains us in the yellow zone with a percent positivity rate of 0.78%.

588
02:21:57,389 --> 02:22:00,111
[SPEAKER_31]: So we are very excited about that.

589
02:22:01,753 --> 02:22:04,555
[SPEAKER_31]: Our school data reflects that decrease.

590
02:22:04,976 --> 02:22:12,682
[SPEAKER_31]: We've administered over 5,300 COVID tests since February 22nd, when we returned from vacation.

591
02:22:13,243 --> 02:22:15,585
[SPEAKER_31]: And we have had all negative test pools.

592
02:22:17,304 --> 02:22:28,752
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd like to thank all students and staff for their continued vigilance and adherence to the public health protocols of mask wearing, frequent hand washing, and maintaining the six feet physical distancing.

593
02:22:29,332 --> 02:22:41,200
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'd also like to thank parents for supporting our efforts by keeping their children home when they are feeling ill and heeding the guidance that's provided by the school nurses for quarantine and isolation.

594
02:22:44,031 --> 02:23:06,108
[SPEAKER_31]: Last week, Governor Baker announced that teachers may now sign up for vaccines at one of three sites, either a state vaccination site, such as Fenway Park or the Danvers Hotel sites, retail pharmacies, such as CVS and Walgreens, and for some patients through their network healthcare providers, such as Lahey Health.

595
02:23:07,355 --> 02:23:15,700
[SPEAKER_31]: Veterans of the armed forces who are registered with the Veterans Administration may have opportunities to obtain a vaccine through their local VA programs.

596
02:23:17,241 --> 02:23:28,648
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm reminding our school staff that at this time, the Medford Board of Health does not expect to receive a shipment of vaccine and therefore will not be able to vaccinate school staff at school.

597
02:23:29,622 --> 02:23:51,959
[SPEAKER_31]: So I encourage everyone to access the state vaccination registration site at vaxfinder.mass.gov, the CVS site at www.cvs.com backslash immunizations, and the Walgreens site at www.walgreens.com backslash topic.

598
02:23:53,373 --> 02:23:57,716
[SPEAKER_31]: backsplash promotion, backsplash COVID vaccine.

599
02:23:58,596 --> 02:24:01,298
[SPEAKER_31]: Supplies are limited and wait times may be long.

600
02:24:02,539 --> 02:24:07,082
[SPEAKER_31]: To enroll in the Veterans Vaccination Program for educators, please call 877-222-8387.

601
02:24:13,925 --> 02:24:23,791
[SPEAKER_31]: Lastly, in preparation for return to in-person learning, I am reassessing our PPE needs, and we will be placing orders for needed materials.

602
02:24:24,212 --> 02:24:24,672
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

603
02:24:27,934 --> 02:24:28,534
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Ms.

604
02:24:28,574 --> 02:24:28,815
[SPEAKER_24]: Ray.

605
02:24:29,595 --> 02:24:30,756
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Murphy, anything to add?

606
02:24:31,396 --> 02:24:31,997
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mayor.

607
02:24:32,017 --> 02:24:34,899
[SPEAKER_23]: Just a quick update from the laity in the public health realm.

608
02:24:36,339 --> 02:24:41,403
[SPEAKER_23]: We've met twice with our bargaining partners as part of the Health and Safety Committee that was part of the MOA.

609
02:24:42,253 --> 02:24:44,714
[SPEAKER_23]: that the school committee approved in January.

610
02:24:45,894 --> 02:24:51,617
[SPEAKER_23]: As part of that meeting, we've got an ongoing dialogue with our teachers union and now our paraprofessional union as well.

611
02:24:52,357 --> 02:25:06,543
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're looking to identify as we continue to have increased in-person instruction, what are the additional things that we need to tighten or where we need to be responsive with regard to concerns around COVID-19.

612
02:25:07,543 --> 02:25:24,921
[SPEAKER_23]: As part of that, we'll be rolling out a easy to use Google form that will allow staff to more easily identify their needs with respect to additional PPE or other materials that are part of our obligation to keep the buildings as safe as possible.

613
02:25:25,562 --> 02:25:29,766
[SPEAKER_23]: As Mr. Ray said, our testing program continues, our numbers

614
02:25:30,239 --> 02:25:35,300
[SPEAKER_23]: are reflective of what we would expect to see based on the declining positivity within the community.

615
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:44,922
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'll just reaffirm what Tony said about our gratitude for people's vigilance and their continued participation in the testing program.

616
02:25:47,023 --> 02:25:47,983
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

617
02:25:48,063 --> 02:25:50,423
[SPEAKER_24]: And if I can just piggyback, I know Ms.

618
02:25:50,463 --> 02:25:52,544
[SPEAKER_24]: Ray, you mentioned to go on mass backs.

619
02:25:53,078 --> 02:25:58,842
[SPEAKER_24]: site or CVS to get tested because of the lack of vaccine that the city's receiving.

620
02:25:59,062 --> 02:26:05,766
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to let everybody know about 10 days ago, we did put in a regional application to hopefully get some vaccines.

621
02:26:06,427 --> 02:26:17,274
[SPEAKER_24]: That was with Somerville CHA and another number of surrounding communities to hopefully do some sort of clinic regional site at Tufts University with a few satellite sites.

622
02:26:17,754 --> 02:26:18,494
[SPEAKER_24]: So we are trying.

623
02:26:20,476 --> 02:26:20,836
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you all.

624
02:26:21,661 --> 02:26:24,207
[SPEAKER_24]: Next up, we have some fun.

625
02:26:24,227 --> 02:26:28,116
[SPEAKER_24]: Number three, announcement of winners of the Unity Poetry Contest.

626
02:26:28,136 --> 02:26:30,321
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Edouard Vincent.

627
02:26:31,297 --> 02:26:40,601
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, so I'm so excited that March 8th is finally here and we are able to really recognize our young poets.

628
02:26:42,181 --> 02:26:43,582
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm really happy.

629
02:26:45,843 --> 02:26:52,886
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, what birthed this was after listening to Amanda Gorman's speech at the inauguration.

630
02:26:54,387 --> 02:27:01,074
[SPEAKER_28]: I was inspired members of my team to give our students an opportunity to showcase their poetry skill sets.

631
02:27:02,515 --> 02:27:05,779
[SPEAKER_28]: And I am pleased to announce that we had close to 120 students.

632
02:27:09,586 --> 02:27:27,752
[SPEAKER_28]: submit poems, and we wanted to make sure for this particular assignment that we not only recognized our hybrid students, but we wanted to recognize our fully remote students as well at the elementary, middle, and high school levels.

633
02:27:30,313 --> 02:27:40,616
[SPEAKER_28]: We had participation from our EL classes and we had one section that we know some of the teachers supported students.

634
02:27:41,796 --> 02:27:47,958
[SPEAKER_28]: We also encourage students to create poetry in any format or language.

635
02:27:47,998 --> 02:27:52,519
[SPEAKER_28]: And so we have a special video presentation today for us as well.

636
02:27:52,980 --> 02:27:57,401
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm happy to see that, share it with the larger community.

637
02:27:58,223 --> 02:28:01,826
[SPEAKER_28]: So I want to welcome our poets who are on the call tonight.

638
02:28:02,006 --> 02:28:06,870
[SPEAKER_28]: I also want to welcome and congratulate, once again, Ms.

639
02:28:06,890 --> 02:28:13,215
[SPEAKER_28]: Shelby Espinola, who was our grade one student who entered our first poem.

640
02:28:14,476 --> 02:28:18,219
[SPEAKER_28]: And she was from Mrs. Fargo's classroom at the Brooks School.

641
02:28:18,839 --> 02:28:20,861
[SPEAKER_28]: And so I just wanted to recognize Shelby

642
02:28:22,742 --> 02:28:24,844
[SPEAKER_28]: being the first person to submit her poem.

643
02:28:26,166 --> 02:28:27,527
[SPEAKER_28]: We really appreciated that.

644
02:28:28,228 --> 02:28:33,434
[SPEAKER_28]: And then I want to recognize who our poetry students are.

645
02:28:34,194 --> 02:28:43,224
[SPEAKER_28]: So this time in reverse order, starting at the high school, we're going to be hearing from Rakita BK,

646
02:28:44,670 --> 02:28:47,971
[SPEAKER_28]: who's a grade 10 vocational student remote.

647
02:28:48,672 --> 02:28:55,494
[SPEAKER_28]: We're gonna hear from Anna Casey, who is a grade 10 student at the high school on the hybrid side.

648
02:28:57,975 --> 02:29:09,340
[SPEAKER_28]: At the middle school level, we're gonna hear from Abdallah Abdelhamid, who is a seventh grade student from the McGlynn and is a remote student.

649
02:29:10,402 --> 02:29:20,266
[SPEAKER_28]: And we're also going to hear from Kevin Azizi, who is a seventh grade student from the McGlynn, who is a hybrid student.

650
02:29:21,026 --> 02:29:29,389
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll also hear today from Lyndon Wise, who is a fourth grade fully remote student at the Roberts Elementary School.

651
02:29:30,409 --> 02:29:37,772
[SPEAKER_28]: And we're going to hear from Joe Hogan, our fourth grade student also at the Roberts, who is a hybrid student.

652
02:29:39,386 --> 02:29:59,000
[SPEAKER_28]: We will hear from Grace McLaughlin, who has provided us with a video, and she is part of our McGlynn hybrid program, and Ronaldo Pereira, who is a 10th grade student at the high school in our hybrid program.

653
02:29:59,661 --> 02:30:07,606
[SPEAKER_28]: I do wanna share with the team that as the poems came in with students' names on them,

654
02:30:08,547 --> 02:30:14,668
[SPEAKER_28]: They were separated by whether the student was hybrid or if the student was remote.

655
02:30:14,708 --> 02:30:18,629
[SPEAKER_28]: So we did separate them into those categories.

656
02:30:19,169 --> 02:30:22,730
[SPEAKER_28]: But we removed the names of the poets.

657
02:30:23,890 --> 02:30:27,211
[SPEAKER_28]: So we had help to score the poems.

658
02:30:27,351 --> 02:30:33,812
[SPEAKER_28]: And I want to send a special thank you to Dr. Chiesa and our humanities team.

659
02:30:35,453 --> 02:30:37,573
[SPEAKER_28]: We had Max Heinig helping.

660
02:30:38,971 --> 02:30:40,732
[SPEAKER_28]: We had Doug Bone Flynn helping.

661
02:30:40,972 --> 02:30:42,313
[SPEAKER_28]: We had Ms.

662
02:30:42,353 --> 02:30:46,617
[SPEAKER_28]: Sanford from the high school also helping to score.

663
02:30:46,857 --> 02:30:48,478
[SPEAKER_28]: We had Mr. Rich Trotter.

664
02:30:49,259 --> 02:30:53,602
[SPEAKER_28]: We had members of our senior leadership team who looked at it.

665
02:30:54,162 --> 02:30:54,843
[SPEAKER_28]: We had Ms.

666
02:30:55,523 --> 02:30:58,645
[SPEAKER_28]: Susie Weiss and Lisa Evangelista.

667
02:30:59,286 --> 02:31:06,111
[SPEAKER_28]: And we did have other people who were looking and reading the poetry so that, you know,

668
02:31:08,476 --> 02:31:16,899
[SPEAKER_28]: If you were at the secondary level, like if you were a high school staff person, you looked at elementary and middle school and the reverse.

669
02:31:17,539 --> 02:31:27,642
[SPEAKER_28]: So we did not want people to be biased or pick students that they already knew the quality of work that they would do.

670
02:31:27,742 --> 02:31:31,183
[SPEAKER_28]: So it really was done blindly.

671
02:31:31,343 --> 02:31:34,124
[SPEAKER_28]: It was just based on how the poems

672
02:31:35,285 --> 02:31:48,536
[SPEAKER_28]: um uh touched the people who were judging and scoring um there were a lot of great poems and I do want to say that because as part of um

673
02:31:50,543 --> 02:31:55,187
[SPEAKER_28]: The expectation, we really wanted to have poems that were about 10 lines long.

674
02:31:56,568 --> 02:32:03,355
[SPEAKER_28]: So there were poems that were very, very beautiful poems, but some of them were significantly longer.

675
02:32:04,075 --> 02:32:15,425
[SPEAKER_28]: And so in trying to be consistent that we had asked for it to be a certain length, those things were taken into consideration when they were being scored.

676
02:32:16,767 --> 02:32:22,417
[SPEAKER_28]: I also want to thank CCSR because our winners will be receiving

677
02:32:24,858 --> 02:32:31,201
[SPEAKER_28]: gift cards, Amazon gift cards donated to the district from CCSR.

678
02:32:31,361 --> 02:32:33,321
[SPEAKER_28]: And so we're very thankful for that.

679
02:32:33,702 --> 02:32:37,843
[SPEAKER_28]: And we will be getting those gift cards out to the winners.

680
02:32:38,283 --> 02:32:41,045
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to say they are $50 gift cards, I believe.

681
02:32:41,585 --> 02:32:42,745
[SPEAKER_28]: So congratulations.

682
02:32:42,805 --> 02:32:48,788
[SPEAKER_28]: And I hope you get some nice poetry books from Amazon or something fun that you all deserve.

683
02:32:49,801 --> 02:32:54,202
[SPEAKER_28]: So I am going to have us do the poets.

684
02:32:55,263 --> 02:33:01,765
[SPEAKER_28]: And Dr. Cushing, I'm going to need your support.

685
02:33:01,905 --> 02:33:07,166
[SPEAKER_28]: But I was going to start with Rakita BK.

686
02:33:14,288 --> 02:33:15,349
[SPEAKER_28]: And I know we have 150 people on the call.

687
02:33:24,061 --> 02:33:27,661
[SPEAKER_08]: If the students could just start their video, that'll help me to find them.

688
02:33:30,542 --> 02:33:37,143
[SPEAKER_28]: Raquita, if you're on the call, can you raise your hand using the reactions?

689
02:33:38,623 --> 02:33:41,304
[SPEAKER_28]: And that will help us be able to find you quickly.

690
02:33:42,444 --> 02:33:43,224
[SPEAKER_29]: I did look for the name.

691
02:33:43,284 --> 02:33:43,984
[SPEAKER_29]: I couldn't find.

692
02:33:44,944 --> 02:33:45,425
[SPEAKER_28]: OK.

693
02:33:45,885 --> 02:33:47,365
[SPEAKER_29]: How about Anna Casey?

694
02:33:49,730 --> 02:33:51,731
[SPEAKER_28]: If you hear your name, raise your hand.

695
02:33:54,233 --> 02:33:54,453
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

696
02:33:54,493 --> 02:33:55,433
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, I'm here.

697
02:33:56,134 --> 02:33:58,035
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, let us find you Anna.

698
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:00,660
[SPEAKER_28]: Wonderful.

699
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:02,481
[SPEAKER_28]: Congratulations.

700
02:34:02,761 --> 02:34:05,061
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much for this opportunity, Superintendent.

701
02:34:05,841 --> 02:34:06,481
[SPEAKER_28]: You're welcome.

702
02:34:06,501 --> 02:34:07,161
[SPEAKER_28]: You deserve it.

703
02:34:07,201 --> 02:34:08,101
[SPEAKER_28]: You did the writing.

704
02:34:08,201 --> 02:34:13,482
[SPEAKER_28]: So we are very excited to hear you share your poem with us.

705
02:34:13,662 --> 02:34:14,483
[SPEAKER_28]: So thank you.

706
02:34:14,523 --> 02:34:15,883
[SPEAKER_28]: You take it away, Anna.

707
02:34:16,383 --> 02:34:16,663
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

708
02:34:17,623 --> 02:34:21,664
[SPEAKER_12]: The title of my poem is called The Ally.

709
02:34:22,844 --> 02:34:28,185
[SPEAKER_12]: The origin of one's name is salient, but it won't always be the common one.

710
02:34:29,209 --> 02:34:31,110
[SPEAKER_12]: They can be rare and may seem different.

711
02:34:32,191 --> 02:34:33,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Diversity is a beautiful thing.

712
02:34:34,973 --> 02:34:37,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Names reflect the colors of one's culture.

713
02:34:37,855 --> 02:34:39,917
[SPEAKER_12]: They open doors to new ideas and thoughts.

714
02:34:40,957 --> 02:34:43,059
[SPEAKER_12]: Embrace someone who doesn't look like you.

715
02:34:43,759 --> 02:34:45,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Diversity is a beautiful thing.

716
02:34:46,441 --> 02:34:52,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Be the ally who takes time to listen and unites us with love and happiness.

717
02:34:55,808 --> 02:34:56,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

718
02:34:59,107 --> 02:34:59,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

719
02:35:01,229 --> 02:35:02,229
[SPEAKER_28]: Wonderful job.

720
02:35:02,830 --> 02:35:04,311
[SPEAKER_28]: Really, really great job.

721
02:35:04,371 --> 02:35:06,232
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much for sharing with us.

722
02:35:06,913 --> 02:35:11,236
[SPEAKER_28]: I know we have quite a few poets to go through, but thank you.

723
02:35:11,296 --> 02:35:16,220
[SPEAKER_28]: And I know it takes a lot of courage to get up here and share your poem, but we appreciate it.

724
02:35:16,740 --> 02:35:22,204
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to see is Abdallah Abdelhamid on grade seven McGlynn remote.

725
02:35:25,787 --> 02:35:26,307
[SPEAKER_29]: I am here.

726
02:35:27,427 --> 02:35:28,267
[SPEAKER_29]: Wonderful.

727
02:35:29,448 --> 02:35:29,848
[SPEAKER_29]: Welcome.

728
02:35:31,908 --> 02:35:34,989
[SPEAKER_00]: My poem is called Us.

729
02:35:35,829 --> 02:35:36,589
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get started.

730
02:35:37,770 --> 02:35:40,110
[SPEAKER_00]: We stand together, united as one.

731
02:35:40,430 --> 02:35:41,931
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do affects all.

732
02:35:41,951 --> 02:35:43,571
[SPEAKER_00]: We show who we are.

733
02:35:43,591 --> 02:35:45,171
[SPEAKER_00]: We fight for freedom.

734
02:35:45,812 --> 02:35:46,932
[SPEAKER_00]: We fight for equal rights.

735
02:35:47,212 --> 02:35:48,912
[SPEAKER_00]: We fight to be known as one.

736
02:35:49,612 --> 02:35:50,733
[SPEAKER_00]: We fight to be united.

737
02:35:50,753 --> 02:35:52,873
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have fought for represents us.

738
02:35:52,973 --> 02:35:54,214
[SPEAKER_00]: It represents our family.

739
02:35:54,234 --> 02:35:55,654
[SPEAKER_00]: It represents our country.

740
02:35:56,069 --> 02:35:57,690
[SPEAKER_00]: that presents us as one.

741
02:36:00,672 --> 02:36:02,032
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Abdallah.

742
02:36:02,192 --> 02:36:03,453
[SPEAKER_29]: Wonderful job.

743
02:36:04,174 --> 02:36:05,254
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much.

744
02:36:07,816 --> 02:36:12,438
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to ask for Kevin Azizi, McGlynn Hybrid.

745
02:36:12,458 --> 02:36:20,523
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you see?

746
02:36:20,563 --> 02:36:21,283
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't see the name.

747
02:36:21,323 --> 02:36:21,623
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you?

748
02:36:21,883 --> 02:36:22,584
[SPEAKER_29]: Raised hand.

749
02:36:23,044 --> 02:36:23,544
[SPEAKER_29]: We need to

750
02:36:25,626 --> 02:36:26,086
[SPEAKER_29]: Unmute.

751
02:36:26,146 --> 02:36:26,446
[SPEAKER_29]: Got it.

752
02:36:27,327 --> 02:36:27,787
[SPEAKER_29]: Perfect.

753
02:36:28,588 --> 02:36:29,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hello.

754
02:36:29,768 --> 02:36:30,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

755
02:36:30,609 --> 02:36:31,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for that.

756
02:36:31,229 --> 02:36:33,450
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just a bit of a mistake there.

757
02:36:35,171 --> 02:36:37,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for letting me do this.

758
02:36:38,233 --> 02:36:42,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, Miss Superintendent.

759
02:36:43,295 --> 02:36:47,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So the title of my poem is The Meaning of Unity.

760
02:36:48,875 --> 02:36:50,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like this.

761
02:36:51,237 --> 02:36:53,698
[SPEAKER_02]: One person can do many great things alone.

762
02:36:54,279 --> 02:36:55,900
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are still limits.

763
02:36:56,280 --> 02:37:00,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And even a genius can't break those limits on his own.

764
02:37:00,543 --> 02:37:04,505
[SPEAKER_02]: When we unite together, achieving great things becomes easier.

765
02:37:04,925 --> 02:37:09,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if ants wouldn't make colonies, they wouldn't be able to survive for long.

766
02:37:10,329 --> 02:37:12,190
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't have such great qualities.

767
02:37:12,670 --> 02:37:14,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And their kingdom wouldn't be much stronger.

768
02:37:15,532 --> 02:37:20,076
[SPEAKER_02]: We gather to help each other, to learn from each other, to make friends and strong connections.

769
02:37:21,057 --> 02:37:23,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Weak things become strong and smart together.

770
02:37:23,319 --> 02:37:24,561
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a rule of the universe.

771
02:37:25,041 --> 02:37:31,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And however big a problem can be, in order to solve it, unity is always the key.

772
02:37:32,708 --> 02:37:33,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

773
02:37:34,710 --> 02:37:35,531
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

774
02:37:35,551 --> 02:37:38,594
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much, Kevin.

775
02:37:42,037 --> 02:37:47,119
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm going to ask for Linden Wise, grade four, Roberts.

776
02:37:55,722 --> 02:38:06,046
[SPEAKER_07]: The name of my poem is called,

777
02:38:10,905 --> 02:38:20,868
[SPEAKER_29]: Lyndon, can you... Lyndon, I... Can you hear us?

778
02:38:22,289 --> 02:38:23,689
[SPEAKER_28]: I got a shaky signal.

779
02:38:23,769 --> 02:38:26,490
[SPEAKER_28]: Would you be able to say your poem one more time, Lyndon?

780
02:38:35,253 --> 02:38:36,213
[SPEAKER_29]: Lyndon, can you hear me?

781
02:38:39,397 --> 02:38:40,278
[SPEAKER_29]: He's muted again.

782
02:38:40,298 --> 02:38:41,439
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

783
02:38:42,519 --> 02:38:43,620
Is it working?

784
02:38:44,100 --> 02:38:44,881
[SPEAKER_24]: Can you hear him?

785
02:38:46,923 --> 02:38:47,643
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a little better.

786
02:38:47,683 --> 02:38:48,664
[SPEAKER_24]: We can hear you a little better.

787
02:38:48,744 --> 02:38:49,584
[SPEAKER_24]: Try one more time.

788
02:38:53,908 --> 02:38:56,510
[SPEAKER_07]: We are all fractions of stardust.

789
02:38:57,791 --> 02:38:59,492
[SPEAKER_07]: The world is the whole.

790
02:39:00,252 --> 02:39:01,673
[SPEAKER_07]: We are tiny by ourselves.

791
02:39:07,466 --> 02:39:08,507
[SPEAKER_25]: China's brighter than the sun.

792
02:39:08,527 --> 02:39:14,212
[SPEAKER_25]: Unity makes the world a better place than it ever was.

793
02:39:14,272 --> 02:39:17,775
Unity has started right here in New York.

794
02:39:18,555 --> 02:39:20,037
Unity is making that better than it ever was.

795
02:39:20,217 --> 02:39:22,579
Unity is making things better.

796
02:39:22,599 --> 02:39:24,340
Unity is making things better.

797
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:26,662
Unity is making things better.

798
02:39:26,862 --> 02:39:28,423
[SPEAKER_25]: Unity is making things better.

799
02:39:28,444 --> 02:39:30,425
Unity is making things better.

800
02:39:30,445 --> 02:39:32,567
Unity is making things better.

801
02:39:32,587 --> 02:39:33,848
Unity is making things better.

802
02:39:43,843 --> 02:39:47,404
[SPEAKER_24]: I heard the line, when we unite, we shine as bright as the sun.

803
02:39:47,424 --> 02:39:48,704
[SPEAKER_24]: That was a great line.

804
02:39:50,145 --> 02:39:51,345
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much, Lyndon.

805
02:39:51,825 --> 02:39:52,845
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Lyndon.

806
02:39:53,606 --> 02:39:59,467
[SPEAKER_28]: And I want to say that I know that Bikita, no, let me see.

807
02:40:00,547 --> 02:40:03,288
[SPEAKER_28]: Rikita BK is on the call.

808
02:40:04,809 --> 02:40:10,090
[SPEAKER_28]: Rikita, if you can hear me, can you raise your hand so we can find you?

809
02:40:22,657 --> 02:40:23,177
[SPEAKER_28]: Makita?

810
02:40:39,750 --> 02:40:40,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

811
02:40:40,031 --> 02:40:40,071
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

812
02:40:40,251 --> 02:40:40,431
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh.

813
02:40:51,785 --> 02:40:52,746
[SPEAKER_24]: He doesn't mute it again.

814
02:40:52,786 --> 02:40:53,666
[SPEAKER_24]: Hold on one second.

815
02:41:10,335 --> 02:41:11,056
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, gosh.

816
02:41:22,329 --> 02:41:24,190
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, can you try now, Rikita?

817
02:41:27,253 --> 02:41:32,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me clearly?

818
02:41:37,681 --> 02:41:39,102
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a little shaky.

819
02:41:44,686 --> 02:41:45,587
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a little shaky.

820
02:41:45,607 --> 02:41:49,590
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you try saying it again, Rikita?

821
02:41:53,939 --> 02:41:55,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me clearly?

822
02:41:57,582 --> 02:41:58,922
[SPEAKER_29]: Not very clearly.

823
02:42:01,104 --> 02:42:05,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Try saying it again.

824
02:42:06,748 --> 02:42:07,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

825
02:42:07,408 --> 02:42:14,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys... My internet connection isn't really the best, so please let me know if you guys... I can hear you now.

826
02:42:14,513 --> 02:42:15,414
[SPEAKER_24]: I can hear you now.

827
02:42:15,814 --> 02:42:16,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

828
02:42:28,404 --> 02:42:32,005
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, I'd like to start by talking about what motivated me to write my poem.

829
02:42:33,505 --> 02:42:39,027
[SPEAKER_03]: So my motivation to write my poem was the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

830
02:42:40,027 --> 02:42:43,588
[SPEAKER_03]: After I learned about their murders, I was devastated.

831
02:42:43,608 --> 02:42:50,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw many people express their feelings about the situations and racism as a whole.

832
02:42:51,161 --> 02:43:00,124
[SPEAKER_03]: But I myself didn't really have the chance to do anything to express how I was affected by the tragic events that happened.

833
02:43:01,804 --> 02:43:09,026
[SPEAKER_03]: When I heard about the poetry contest, I saw it as an opportunity to express how I feel and to show that I cared.

834
02:43:09,766 --> 02:43:16,088
[SPEAKER_03]: That I cared about the importance of being there for each other when we are going through rough times.

835
02:43:16,308 --> 02:43:19,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I care about the problems that are present in our world today.

836
02:43:20,512 --> 02:43:23,214
[SPEAKER_03]: and that I care about the importance of unity.

837
02:43:24,015 --> 02:43:30,159
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a poem that slipped from my heart regarding the topic of unity.

838
02:43:31,820 --> 02:43:36,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't breathe, those eight minutes, 15 seconds he spent in agony.

839
02:43:37,925 --> 02:43:43,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Say her name, left untouched, pouring warm red, those bitter minutes.

840
02:43:45,510 --> 02:43:49,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Their throats dry, their silent cries, their wishes gone,

841
02:43:50,250 --> 02:43:51,831
[SPEAKER_03]: this cruel reality.

842
02:43:52,931 --> 02:43:56,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom makes an appearance, but equality is still limited.

843
02:43:57,732 --> 02:44:02,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Those fights against fear, those weepings for freedom, let's not let them go in vain.

844
02:44:03,734 --> 02:44:06,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's finish building that world of love.

845
02:44:07,135 --> 02:44:11,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we change this void into the world that they had dreamed of?

846
02:44:12,637 --> 02:44:18,839
[SPEAKER_03]: My brothers and sisters from the city of waters and the land of tomorrow to the place of the Great Hill,

847
02:44:19,830 --> 02:44:22,492
[SPEAKER_03]: help prevent the repeat of our collided history.

848
02:44:23,172 --> 02:44:29,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Our strongest weapon against the storms of despair and inhumanity is our unity.

849
02:44:29,676 --> 02:44:30,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

850
02:44:32,058 --> 02:44:33,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Rikita.

851
02:44:33,259 --> 02:44:34,159
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

852
02:44:34,179 --> 02:44:37,881
[SPEAKER_21]: That was beautiful, Rikita.

853
02:44:37,922 --> 02:44:38,762
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

854
02:44:41,224 --> 02:44:44,246
[SPEAKER_29]: I would like to now introduce Joe Hogan.

855
02:44:45,306 --> 02:44:47,788
[SPEAKER_28]: Joe Hogan, grade four, Roberts.

856
02:44:53,735 --> 02:44:54,515
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi, that's me.

857
02:44:55,355 --> 02:44:57,156
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you for letting me be here.

858
02:44:57,176 --> 02:44:58,516
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh wait, my video's off.

859
02:44:58,856 --> 02:45:00,136
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, let's turn that video on.

860
02:45:00,396 --> 02:45:01,696
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, it's on now.

861
02:45:02,737 --> 02:45:04,997
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, so here's my poem.

862
02:45:06,157 --> 02:45:09,398
[SPEAKER_35]: I do not want to inherit a world that does not stay united.

863
02:45:09,978 --> 02:45:11,078
[SPEAKER_35]: The world is like blocks.

864
02:45:11,298 --> 02:45:13,638
[SPEAKER_35]: Every time you unite them, they fall down again.

865
02:45:14,518 --> 02:45:16,999
[SPEAKER_35]: If we can unite, the world will be like Legos.

866
02:45:17,139 --> 02:45:18,119
[SPEAKER_35]: They stay together.

867
02:45:18,879 --> 02:45:21,740
[SPEAKER_35]: Then I want to inherit that world because it is united.

868
02:45:22,460 --> 02:45:23,580
[SPEAKER_35]: So what world are we?

869
02:45:23,999 --> 02:45:25,320
[SPEAKER_35]: a Lego or building block.

870
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:26,420
[SPEAKER_35]: We cannot be both.

871
02:45:29,702 --> 02:45:30,823
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much.

872
02:45:31,403 --> 02:45:32,064
[SPEAKER_29]: Great job.

873
02:45:32,484 --> 02:45:33,304
[SPEAKER_29]: Great job.

874
02:45:33,485 --> 02:45:36,386
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for sharing your poem tonight.

875
02:45:37,047 --> 02:45:38,307
[SPEAKER_29]: I think we have Lyndon back.

876
02:45:38,507 --> 02:45:39,848
[SPEAKER_29]: He's going to try one more time.

877
02:45:41,249 --> 02:45:41,589
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

878
02:45:41,969 --> 02:45:42,350
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

879
02:45:42,410 --> 02:45:42,830
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

880
02:45:42,990 --> 02:45:44,411
[SPEAKER_24]: Can you hear us now?

881
02:45:45,111 --> 02:45:45,972
[SPEAKER_24]: A little bit better.

882
02:45:48,093 --> 02:45:48,913
[SPEAKER_24]: Give it a try, Lyndon.

883
02:45:54,414 --> 02:46:05,719
[SPEAKER_28]: Sometimes if, if you turn the camera, I was going to say, if you temporarily turn the camera off, sometimes that improves the audio.

884
02:46:06,459 --> 02:46:09,040
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, so we can hear Lyndon's words.

885
02:46:18,804 --> 02:46:19,004
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

886
02:46:20,184 --> 02:46:20,625
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

887
02:46:21,105 --> 02:46:21,225
Yes.

888
02:46:25,356 --> 02:46:26,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, go ahead.

889
02:46:26,377 --> 02:46:29,419
[SPEAKER_07]: We are all fractions of stardust.

890
02:46:30,299 --> 02:46:31,620
[SPEAKER_07]: The world is the whole.

891
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:36,724
[SPEAKER_07]: We are tiny by ourselves, floating and waiting to come together.

892
02:46:37,404 --> 02:46:40,407
[SPEAKER_07]: When we unite, we can shine as bright as the sun.

893
02:46:41,507 --> 02:46:47,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Unity makes the world warm and happy, and we can start right where we are.

894
02:46:47,792 --> 02:46:52,135
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do English muffins from scratch with my grandmother.

895
02:46:52,972 --> 02:46:55,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Unity is making leaves with my neighbors.

896
02:46:56,393 --> 02:46:58,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Unity is playing chair with my classmates.

897
02:46:59,434 --> 02:47:02,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Unity is cleaning up the fells with my friends.

898
02:47:02,835 --> 02:47:04,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not forget each other.

899
02:47:04,296 --> 02:47:06,937
[SPEAKER_07]: The earth is still blooming with love.

900
02:47:09,398 --> 02:47:10,018
[SPEAKER_24]: Wonderful.

901
02:47:11,618 --> 02:47:15,520
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Lyndon, for coming back on and sharing with us.

902
02:47:15,620 --> 02:47:16,460
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much.

903
02:47:18,066 --> 02:47:26,330
[SPEAKER_28]: So we have a video right now, and this video is by Grace McLaughlin, and we're very happy.

904
02:47:26,350 --> 02:47:34,554
[SPEAKER_28]: Dr. Cushing, are you able to queue the video up for us?

905
02:48:05,630 --> 02:48:07,777
[SPEAKER_08]: One moment, attempting to figure out the audio.

906
02:48:07,938 --> 02:48:08,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one moment.

907
02:48:34,773 --> 02:48:35,934
[SPEAKER_22]: Here we go, Gracie.

908
02:49:00,009 --> 02:49:03,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Mayor, would you go on to another person while I fix the audio?

909
02:49:04,517 --> 02:49:05,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, absolutely.

910
02:49:06,518 --> 02:49:10,459
[SPEAKER_28]: Presenter is Ronaldo Pereira.

911
02:49:10,739 --> 02:49:19,681
[SPEAKER_28]: And I do want to thank Mr. Paul Texera, who helped considerably in reading through our poem submitted by our EL students.

912
02:49:20,901 --> 02:49:28,443
[SPEAKER_28]: So Ronaldo Pereira, and I believe there may be a few other students helping to recite that poem.

913
02:49:29,063 --> 02:49:30,844
[SPEAKER_28]: Ronaldo, are you on the call?

914
02:49:34,758 --> 02:49:35,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, indeed I am.

915
02:49:36,218 --> 02:49:37,319
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, wonderful.

916
02:49:40,019 --> 02:49:41,080
[SPEAKER_15]: I need my classmates.

917
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:42,660
[SPEAKER_28]: You need your classmates.

918
02:49:42,700 --> 02:49:44,601
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you tell me the name of your classmates?

919
02:49:45,261 --> 02:49:46,161
[SPEAKER_28]: So we can find them.

920
02:49:47,481 --> 02:49:52,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark Oli, Dakayel, and Jeannie.

921
02:49:53,123 --> 02:49:55,543
[SPEAKER_28]: OK, Dakayel Lemos.

922
02:49:57,984 --> 02:49:58,484
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

923
02:49:59,565 --> 02:50:01,025
[SPEAKER_29]: OK, and Jeannie.

924
02:50:06,274 --> 02:50:06,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

925
02:50:08,015 --> 02:50:08,496
[SPEAKER_21]: You're on.

926
02:50:08,636 --> 02:50:17,642
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, Ronaldo.

927
02:50:22,885 --> 02:50:23,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

928
02:50:23,606 --> 02:50:27,969
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, I want to thank you all of them.

929
02:50:28,809 --> 02:50:29,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank Ms.

930
02:50:29,870 --> 02:50:32,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Saul-Nido for this opportunity.

931
02:50:33,212 --> 02:50:35,354
[SPEAKER_09]: It's our pleasure to introduce ourselves

932
02:50:45,710 --> 02:50:46,236
[SPEAKER_09]: One moment.

933
02:51:00,472 --> 02:51:01,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Rinaldo, can you hear us?

934
02:51:02,094 --> 02:51:02,975
[SPEAKER_19]: This is Nasonye.

935
02:51:03,796 --> 02:51:04,156
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, yeah.

936
02:51:05,237 --> 02:51:07,079
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, here we go.

937
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:10,083
[SPEAKER_19]: So you have I will help you find the poem.

938
02:51:11,584 --> 02:51:18,012
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to interrupt superintendent because I think he's working on another technical aspect.

939
02:51:18,092 --> 02:51:20,915
[SPEAKER_19]: But here is your poem.

940
02:51:33,547 --> 02:51:35,328
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you want to introduce it first, Ronaldo?

941
02:51:35,388 --> 02:51:37,369
[SPEAKER_19]: Or would you like to just go ahead and start?

942
02:51:41,131 --> 02:51:42,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I must start this poem.

943
02:51:42,672 --> 02:51:43,453
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna read it all.

944
02:51:44,773 --> 02:51:46,915
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'm gonna talk a little bit about it.

945
02:51:46,935 --> 02:51:52,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so.

946
02:51:54,179 --> 02:51:59,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Face of the same face, brothers and sisters of very other age and race.

947
02:51:59,722 --> 02:52:03,364
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all one and we all come from and we all return home.

948
02:52:03,899 --> 02:52:05,180
[SPEAKER_15]: to the same internal place.

949
02:52:09,082 --> 02:52:19,749
[SPEAKER_15]: So while I was writing this poem, I was with my classmates and I didn't really know what the definition of unity was.

950
02:52:20,270 --> 02:52:32,798
[SPEAKER_15]: So I looked for help and my friends was there and I saw all of the poems and I was getting examples and I see the team

951
02:52:33,578 --> 02:52:37,359
[SPEAKER_15]: the theme of all of this, unity, it's unity.

952
02:52:37,439 --> 02:52:43,280
[SPEAKER_15]: So I took a little bit of everyone and I wrote it.

953
02:52:47,081 --> 02:52:50,001
[SPEAKER_15]: So you wanna talk about a little bit, Jenny?

954
02:52:51,021 --> 02:52:59,963
[SPEAKER_19]: So Ronaldo, why don't we have the people who wrote the lines of the poem help you read the poem one last time and we'll let Jenny start.

955
02:53:14,304 --> 02:53:17,607
[SPEAKER_10]: The title of our poem is called, Unity.

956
02:53:19,488 --> 02:53:21,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Face of the same face.

957
02:53:26,574 --> 02:53:27,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead, Mark.

958
02:53:32,859 --> 02:53:36,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Of every other age and race, we are all one.

959
02:53:41,085 --> 02:53:42,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all come from?

960
02:53:44,642 --> 02:53:47,143
[SPEAKER_15]: and we all come from and we all return home.

961
02:53:50,123 --> 02:53:52,984
[SPEAKER_19]: To the same eternal place.

962
02:53:53,804 --> 02:53:54,324
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice job.

963
02:54:02,646 --> 02:54:03,427
[SPEAKER_29]: Amazing job.

964
02:54:03,867 --> 02:54:04,547
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, thank you.

965
02:54:05,060 --> 02:54:09,001
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you so much for that collaborative group effort.

966
02:54:10,661 --> 02:54:19,083
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to thank, again, all of our poets who participated in submitting poems.

967
02:54:19,523 --> 02:54:29,344
[SPEAKER_28]: We are going to be posting all the poems that were submitted and recognizing everyone.

968
02:54:30,105 --> 02:54:31,705
[SPEAKER_28]: We know that we can't formally

969
02:54:34,974 --> 02:54:43,476
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to have a bracelet and other ways to acknowledge the students that participated in the unity poem and they will be receiving that.

970
02:54:45,037 --> 02:54:52,219
[SPEAKER_28]: But we wanted to specifically call out those who were selected as winners.

971
02:54:52,839 --> 02:55:00,361
[SPEAKER_28]: And so Dr. Cushing has our final poetry piece to present from us from Grace McLaughlin.

972
02:55:01,161 --> 02:55:01,802
[SPEAKER_28]: Dr. Cushing.

973
02:55:02,442 --> 02:55:03,302
[SPEAKER_16]: What does unity mean?

974
02:55:06,090 --> 02:55:07,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Unity means what?

975
02:55:08,951 --> 02:55:11,933
[SPEAKER_16]: All a group together.

976
02:55:12,093 --> 02:55:13,413
[SPEAKER_16]: A group together, right?

977
02:55:13,473 --> 02:55:19,796
[SPEAKER_16]: No matter if you're white or black or if you have Down syndrome.

978
02:55:20,857 --> 02:55:26,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Unity means all are together.

979
02:55:27,180 --> 02:55:27,880
[SPEAKER_16]: No matter what.

980
02:55:28,300 --> 02:55:30,541
[SPEAKER_16]: No matter what.

981
02:55:31,381 --> 02:55:31,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Right?

982
02:55:33,782 --> 02:55:33,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

983
02:55:41,277 --> 02:55:44,859
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you and congratulations.

984
02:55:46,360 --> 02:55:47,341
[SPEAKER_24]: Did you have your hand up?

985
02:55:47,781 --> 02:55:50,203
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I just, these were just great.

986
02:55:50,583 --> 02:55:59,268
[SPEAKER_27]: I really, really liked seeing them.

987
02:56:00,589 --> 02:56:02,110
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I just wanted to say thank you.

988
02:56:02,170 --> 02:56:04,471
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are beautiful and good medicine.

989
02:56:04,631 --> 02:56:07,113
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you very much to the students.

990
02:56:15,382 --> 02:56:17,083
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry about that.

991
02:56:17,103 --> 02:56:17,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, go ahead.

992
02:56:17,743 --> 02:56:18,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, Democrats.

993
02:56:18,403 --> 02:56:20,524
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we got under control.

994
02:56:39,594 --> 02:56:40,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, did you hear me?

995
02:56:40,735 --> 02:56:41,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll say it again.

996
02:56:42,216 --> 02:56:43,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to all the students.

997
02:56:43,657 --> 02:56:46,599
[SPEAKER_05]: All the poems were beautifully written and inspirational.

998
02:56:46,660 --> 02:56:48,221
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all talented poets.

999
02:56:48,361 --> 02:56:49,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredible job to everyone.

1000
02:56:50,002 --> 02:56:50,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all.

1001
02:56:55,246 --> 02:56:56,367
[SPEAKER_24]: Wonderful job, everybody.

1002
02:56:56,427 --> 02:56:56,787
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1003
02:56:56,807 --> 02:57:00,530
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you to our superintendent for having the idea.

1004
02:57:00,550 --> 02:57:01,691
[SPEAKER_24]: It was wonderful.

1005
02:57:03,913 --> 02:57:09,277
[SPEAKER_24]: Next, we have number four report on the McGlynn Middle School by Principal Nick Tucci.

1006
02:57:10,765 --> 02:57:12,405
[SPEAKER_24]: You have five minutes, Nick.

1007
02:57:17,662 --> 02:57:19,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, good evening, Medford School Committee.

1008
02:57:19,383 --> 02:57:20,843
[SPEAKER_01]: What a difficult act to follow there.

1009
02:57:21,023 --> 02:57:23,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful poets here in our Medford Public Schools communities.

1010
02:57:23,764 --> 02:57:24,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Great job, everyone.

1011
02:57:25,705 --> 02:57:32,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, our school site council made up of students, teachers, caregivers, and administrators worked diligently to develop our school's mission statement.

1012
02:57:32,768 --> 02:57:33,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And it reads as follows.

1013
02:57:34,629 --> 02:57:44,473
[SPEAKER_01]: The McGlynn Middle School's mission is to provide all students with an education and a safe and respectful learning environment that meets the needs of the whole child, empowering them to reach their potential as learners.

1014
02:57:45,473 --> 02:57:49,317
[SPEAKER_01]: In a collaborative and rigorous learning environment, students are challenged to be critical thinkers.

1015
02:57:50,317 --> 02:57:56,363
[SPEAKER_01]: The McGlynn Middle School celebrates diversity in an inclusive and equitable learning environment designed to foster student growth and achievements.

1016
02:57:57,604 --> 02:58:06,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Our school strives to develop engaged, contributing citizens in society by emphasizing the importance of personal integrity and a drive to become lifelong learners.

1017
02:58:07,435 --> 02:58:17,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as leader of our school in the midst of the most challenging of years, I can truthfully state that we've held ourselves to this mission and will continue to strive towards meeting and exceeding our mission in the future.

1018
02:58:18,488 --> 02:58:25,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I give a tremendous amount of credit to our students, families, and staff that have stepped up to meet the demands and challenges of this school year.

1019
02:58:27,076 --> 02:58:31,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me first begin by acknowledging our middle school students and families.

1020
02:58:32,177 --> 02:58:38,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Our 444 students have proven to be resilient in adapting to the expectations of this year.

1021
02:58:38,918 --> 02:58:45,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, we have 171 students learning remotely, while 273 students participate in our hybrid learning track.

1022
02:58:47,220 --> 02:58:51,761
[SPEAKER_01]: As you all know, all students started off learning remotely for the first few weeks of the school year in September.

1023
02:58:52,101 --> 02:58:55,922
[SPEAKER_01]: But after just a few weeks of remote learning, we welcomed back students in cohort A,

1024
02:58:57,082 --> 02:59:05,826
[SPEAKER_01]: At the McGlynn Middle School, this was a sizable amount of students made up of groups of special education students, level one and two English language learners, and homeless students.

1025
02:59:06,986 --> 02:59:13,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Shortly thereafter, we transitioned back our sixth graders to hybrid learning, followed by our seventh and eighth graders.

1026
02:59:14,129 --> 02:59:21,552
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result of strategic scheduling, we designed a system that enabled students and families to choose between remote learning or hybrid learning.

1027
02:59:22,449 --> 02:59:30,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been supportive and flexible in honoring the decisions of families to move between the remote or hybrid learning models depending upon their unique needs.

1028
02:59:31,656 --> 02:59:43,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Students have been scheduled in cohorts and pods and have traveled from class to class in the same pods in order to prevent cross-contamination and to contain a potential outbreak of COVID related cases.

1029
02:59:45,327 --> 02:59:51,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Students have had to adapt to new routines and expectations for participating and engaging in their hybrid and remote learning.

1030
02:59:52,571 --> 02:59:54,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Collectively, they've done amazing work.

1031
02:59:55,536 --> 03:00:02,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Our levels of student engagement with both hybrid and remote learning have improved tremendously as a result of the structures and systems that have been put in place.

1032
03:00:04,053 --> 03:00:16,325
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the number of students earning the distinction of being an honor roll student grew exponentially from first quarter to second quarter at the school as a result of the hard work by students staff and support of their parents and caretakers.

1033
03:00:17,366 --> 03:00:23,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to publicly thank the middle school parents guardians and caretakers for all their support of their children's education this year.

1034
03:00:24,213 --> 03:00:29,276
[SPEAKER_01]: More so than ever, we've been dependent on families to collaborate with us at the school to support their students' education.

1035
03:00:29,936 --> 03:00:37,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found our families to be very supportive of our efforts and willing to work with us to develop tailored action plans for students that might require interventions.

1036
03:00:38,761 --> 03:00:46,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be remiss if I didn't publicly thank the staff at the McGlynn Middle School for their dedication, flexibility, hard work, resilience, attention to detail, and care for our students.

1037
03:00:47,668 --> 03:00:51,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Educators have had to adapt to a significant evolution in the profession over the past year.

1038
03:00:52,289 --> 03:01:01,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Educators have engaged in countless hours of professional development to evolve as a practitioner, to meet the needs of our students who are learning both in-person and remotely.

1039
03:01:02,291 --> 03:01:17,154
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, our educators have been focused on targeted professional development throughout the year, on topics of racial equity, cultural proficiency, integration of new technology resources in the classroom, and supporting students who present with anxiety.

1040
03:01:18,692 --> 03:01:25,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Educators have been able to successfully integrate multiple technology platforms into their classrooms to support them and meet the needs of our learners.

1041
03:01:27,058 --> 03:01:36,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Educators have upheld the rituals, routines, and practices in our building to maintain the safety-related protocols that have been put in place in order to keep everybody safe from the spread of COVID.

1042
03:01:37,898 --> 03:01:49,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Our custodians, they work diligently over the summertime in order to reorient the building to respond to the nature of operating schools under the constraints of six feet of physical distancing.

1043
03:01:50,911 --> 03:02:00,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Custodians consistently clean, disinfect and sanitize every square foot of the building while in operation and during times when students and staff are not in the building to help prevent the spread of disease.

1044
03:02:02,236 --> 03:02:19,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Our team of nurses have gone above and beyond this school year to prevent the spread of disease and to respond to the challenges associated with contact tracing, implementing COVID testing for both elementary and middle school students at our school and supporting the health needs of our students on a daily basis.

1045
03:02:20,827 --> 03:02:27,911
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not uncommon for me to be in contact with our team of nurses seven days a week to respond to COVID related impacts on our school community.

1046
03:02:29,161 --> 03:02:34,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to report that we have not had a COVID positive case at the McGlynn Middle School in the past six weeks plus.

1047
03:02:36,543 --> 03:02:41,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I commend our team of nurses for their knowledge, precision, and care of our students and staff.

1048
03:02:41,525 --> 03:02:42,285
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been top notch.

1049
03:02:44,106 --> 03:02:50,608
[SPEAKER_01]: The tireless hard work of our support staff at the McGlynn Middle School made up of administrators, administrative assistants, and Councilors have also been commendable.

1050
03:02:51,448 --> 03:02:58,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of these individuals spend much of their time supporting students to make progress towards their growth as a learner while supporting their social and emotional needs.

1051
03:03:00,265 --> 03:03:07,766
[SPEAKER_01]: The McGlynn Middle School has continued to engage our students in our tradition of having school-wide and grade-level wind block assemblies on a regular basis.

1052
03:03:08,566 --> 03:03:11,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to COVID, these assemblies have all taken place virtually this school year.

1053
03:03:12,507 --> 03:03:19,468
[SPEAKER_01]: These wind block assemblies have been important in delivering educational presentations to students on relevant topics that pertain to school and life.

1054
03:03:20,308 --> 03:03:25,329
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is a list of some of the virtual wind block presentations this school year that our students have participated in.

1055
03:03:26,249 --> 03:03:29,250
[SPEAKER_01]: One on mental health awareness, cyber safety,

1056
03:03:30,270 --> 03:03:35,272
[SPEAKER_01]: dangers associated with vaping, an assembly titled what's up with bullying.

1057
03:03:36,213 --> 03:03:45,137
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our virtual club and activities fair about five, six weeks ago, a Mustang Way assembly, a presentation from top youth speaker, Dr. John Gaines.

1058
03:03:46,278 --> 03:03:50,240
[SPEAKER_01]: A few weeks ago, we had a presentation on tales from African traditions.

1059
03:03:51,459 --> 03:03:57,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Principal DeLeva and Principal Fallon just did an assembly for our eighth grade students on the eighth to ninth grade transition to high school.

1060
03:03:58,162 --> 03:04:02,484
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have had several grade level assemblies to support students transitioning to in-person learning.

1061
03:04:03,424 --> 03:04:20,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also look forward to two upcoming presentations in the next few weeks, one on substance abuse led by Dr. Randy Schuster of Harvard University and Mass General Hospital, and actually an upcoming assembly this Wednesday from a NASA engineer who will present on the topic of her ongoing work associated with the Mars exploration.

1062
03:04:22,466 --> 03:04:27,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So the McGlynn Middle School, we've continued also our tradition of publicly honoring students who exemplify the Mustang way.

1063
03:04:28,271 --> 03:04:32,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of the past several years, students have been challenged to strive toward living the Mustang way every day.

1064
03:04:33,015 --> 03:04:36,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And this means that they bring their best attitude, concentration, and effort to their day.

1065
03:04:36,938 --> 03:04:40,461
[SPEAKER_01]: We instill in our students the expectation that they're respectful and lead by example.

1066
03:04:41,261 --> 03:04:47,987
[SPEAKER_01]: This philosophy fits in with our mission of creating contributing citizens in society, while emphasizing that importance on personal integrity.

1067
03:04:49,286 --> 03:04:56,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Our eighth grade students are in the process of designing and implementing their civic engagement projects, working with their social studies teachers.

1068
03:04:56,789 --> 03:05:04,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to seeing these student-driven projects come to fruition, as they'll impact our students and our Medford community in a very positive way.

1069
03:05:05,652 --> 03:05:17,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the course of the school year, the Middle School Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility has led the way in developing projects that have made our community stronger, while instilling important values in our student leaders along the way.

1070
03:05:19,352 --> 03:05:27,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Our National Junior Honors Society have begun virtual tutoring sessions to help fellow peers academically after school and also on the asynchronous Wednesdays.

1071
03:05:29,343 --> 03:05:44,230
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also very excited to support eighth grader Daviana Viega, who is our project 351 representative and her leadership role in implementing the cradles to crayons project that all the 351 project ambassadors carry into their community to make a difference.

1072
03:05:44,770 --> 03:05:52,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Daviana just participated in launch day yesterday, and I had the pleasure of speaking with her this afternoon, and she's really excited about making that difference in Medford.

1073
03:05:53,766 --> 03:06:05,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So in conclusion, despite the inherent challenges associated with the school year due to COVID-19 and the pandemic, the McGlynn Middle School students, families, and staff have stepped up to the plate to accomplish our collective goals while staying true to our mission.

1074
03:06:05,653 --> 03:06:09,135
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you for your time, and I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have.

1075
03:06:10,896 --> 03:06:12,277
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much, Mr. Tucci.

1076
03:06:13,998 --> 03:06:14,738
[SPEAKER_24]: Very detailed.

1077
03:06:16,559 --> 03:06:17,720
[SPEAKER_24]: There are no questions.

1078
03:06:19,181 --> 03:06:23,023
[SPEAKER_24]: We will go on to number five, deadline for secondary cohort

1079
03:06:23,376 --> 03:06:25,838
[SPEAKER_24]: Boarding Assignments, March 12, 2021.

1080
03:06:26,118 --> 03:06:26,979
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. David Murphy.

1081
03:06:28,320 --> 03:06:28,840
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mayor.

1082
03:06:28,920 --> 03:06:36,746
[SPEAKER_23]: So we spoke about this earlier in the meeting in response to the superintendent's presentation and some questions from the committee.

1083
03:06:36,806 --> 03:06:44,593
[SPEAKER_23]: So the committee and for the members of the community watching this meeting may already be familiar with this just from that discussion.

1084
03:06:44,633 --> 03:06:45,974
[SPEAKER_23]: So I will keep this brief.

1085
03:06:47,074 --> 03:06:51,418
[SPEAKER_23]: The district announced a week ago this past Friday

1086
03:06:52,455 --> 03:07:08,826
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that would have been February 26th, that for students at the secondary level, there would be an expectation of a commitment to a specific cohort by March 12th with attendance implications taking effect on Monday, March 15th.

1087
03:07:09,646 --> 03:07:18,472
[SPEAKER_23]: There are several reasons for this that Dr. Cushing and others have touched upon earlier this evening with regard to attempting to create the conditions that would be

1088
03:07:18,959 --> 03:07:27,641
[SPEAKER_23]: most conducive to robust student engagement and regular student attendance in person for those families who have chosen to attend school in person.

1089
03:07:28,481 --> 03:07:38,184
[SPEAKER_23]: The logistical and operational basis for this deadline is because of the likelihood of potential increased in-person instruction for the remainder of the school year.

1090
03:07:38,664 --> 03:07:48,566
[SPEAKER_23]: In order to operationalize increased in-person instruction, we need to have an accurate understanding as to the numbers behind each cohort.

1091
03:07:49,338 --> 03:07:56,083
[SPEAKER_23]: So that is the basis for the deadline that is now in effect and will be in effect as of Friday, March 12th.

1092
03:07:57,463 --> 03:08:14,615
[SPEAKER_23]: And with regard to the decision that was made by the Board of Education last week, as Dr. Cushing referenced earlier, that decision by the board gives the commissioner authority to define structured learning time.

1093
03:08:15,908 --> 03:08:20,210
[SPEAKER_23]: as in-person instruction unless a family has chosen to be fully remote.

1094
03:08:20,950 --> 03:08:32,896
[SPEAKER_23]: So all that's happened so far is that the commission, the board has conferred upon the commissioner the authority to impose that requirement on districts.

1095
03:08:33,796 --> 03:08:35,797
[SPEAKER_23]: That requirement has not yet been imposed.

1096
03:08:36,738 --> 03:08:44,141
[SPEAKER_23]: We have every expectation that it will be starting at the elementary level in the very near future, taking effect in April.

1097
03:08:45,009 --> 03:09:02,117
[SPEAKER_23]: What that timeline will look like at the secondary level and exactly what implementation will look like at the secondary level, we don't know yet, but that's something that we are actively working on and will continue to communicate regularly with both staff and families and students who I'm sure are interested as well.

1098
03:09:03,337 --> 03:09:08,459
[SPEAKER_23]: There will be obligations that we will have with regard to conversations with our bargaining partners.

1099
03:09:09,160 --> 03:09:12,141
[SPEAKER_23]: Our memorandum of agreement contemplates that scenario.

1100
03:09:12,802 --> 03:09:18,506
[SPEAKER_23]: And we will engage in those discussions as we're obligated to do and as we look forward to doing always.

1101
03:09:19,327 --> 03:09:24,951
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that's where we're at right now in terms of what's been decided and what has not yet been decided.

1102
03:09:25,591 --> 03:09:30,154
[SPEAKER_23]: And so there is a bit of a runway that we'll be continuing to move down.

1103
03:09:30,855 --> 03:09:42,383
[SPEAKER_23]: But I think for purposes of clarity for tonight, what people should know is that we do anticipate increased in-person instruction at all grade levels at some point throughout the remainder of the school year.

1104
03:09:42,995 --> 03:09:47,097
[SPEAKER_23]: but exactly how and when are things that still have to be worked out.

1105
03:09:47,697 --> 03:09:56,821
[SPEAKER_23]: But we know we wouldn't be able to do it, and we wouldn't be able to establish a timeline or a way to do it if we don't have more certainty with regard to students' cohorts.

1106
03:09:57,281 --> 03:10:04,384
[SPEAKER_23]: The last thing I will say is that while it's not explicitly referenced in our communications, we know that there will be extenuating circumstances.

1107
03:10:05,024 --> 03:10:09,766
[SPEAKER_23]: And as is always the case, we will look at those extenuating circumstances and try to respond in the way

1108
03:10:10,599 --> 03:10:12,980
[SPEAKER_23]: that serves students' best interests.

1109
03:10:13,900 --> 03:10:21,942
[SPEAKER_23]: That would include situations, obviously, when if students are sick, if they have symptoms, things of that nature, we're going to try to keep students engaged.

1110
03:10:22,022 --> 03:10:27,323
[SPEAKER_23]: So there could be situations in which students have committed to cohorts B or C. They're quarantined.

1111
03:10:27,784 --> 03:10:34,105
[SPEAKER_23]: They're not going to be told that they cannot participate in school since their peers in cohort D will be participating remotely.

1112
03:10:34,185 --> 03:10:37,346
[SPEAKER_23]: So there'll still be flexibility with regard to those situations.

1113
03:10:38,203 --> 03:10:48,686
[SPEAKER_23]: So I see just about every single committee member's hand is up, which means my attempt to provide clarity may or may not have succeeded, but I'm happy to answer any questions.

1114
03:10:49,566 --> 03:10:50,947
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm gonna go with what I saw.

1115
03:10:50,967 --> 03:10:52,667
[SPEAKER_24]: I saw member Stone, do you have a question?

1116
03:10:54,228 --> 03:10:54,868
[SPEAKER_24]: Nope, okay.

1117
03:10:55,068 --> 03:10:57,769
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I saw member McLaughlin, member Ruseau, member Van der Kloot.

1118
03:10:59,309 --> 03:11:03,251
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1119
03:11:03,511 --> 03:11:07,772
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to know also some clarification on

1120
03:11:08,339 --> 03:11:10,020
[SPEAKER_20]: the sports contingency.

1121
03:11:10,120 --> 03:11:29,415
[SPEAKER_20]: So was it that you had to have, you have to be in attendance to participate in sports, meaning you are in attendance either remotely or in attendance in person and you're remaining to your cohort, or as some people, I think mistakenly thought, do you have to be an in-person student to participate in sports?

1122
03:11:29,775 --> 03:11:30,836
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a great question.

1123
03:11:30,956 --> 03:11:33,458
[SPEAKER_23]: And if that is a piece of confusion, it's something that we can

1124
03:11:33,928 --> 03:11:36,028
[SPEAKER_23]: double down on with regard to the communication.

1125
03:11:36,068 --> 03:11:50,992
[SPEAKER_23]: But if a student chooses cohort D, meaning they are fully remote, then they can still participate in sports contingent upon being in attendance remotely in class and participating in the COVID-19 testing program.

1126
03:11:51,252 --> 03:11:57,173
[SPEAKER_23]: But provided those two conditions are met, then the students are welcome to participate in all extracurricular activities, including athletics.

1127
03:11:59,533 --> 03:12:00,434
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you both.

1128
03:12:00,974 --> 03:12:02,454
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Ruseau, then Member Van der Kloot.

1129
03:12:05,104 --> 03:12:10,165
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that this decision is barely one business day old.

1130
03:12:10,545 --> 03:12:17,886
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't expect that many of these questions have answers yet, but two questions.

1131
03:12:18,046 --> 03:12:27,128
[SPEAKER_14]: One, Somerville is finally bringing their students back and they are mandating if you wanna come back, you will be getting COVID tests.

1132
03:12:27,608 --> 03:12:29,708
[SPEAKER_14]: And their attorneys have said that that is legal.

1133
03:12:31,249 --> 03:12:33,509
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we approach the scenario where

1134
03:12:34,518 --> 03:12:44,504
[SPEAKER_14]: One, most of our students are not getting COVID tests, and we may have got quite as many students packed in or more into the same spaces.

1135
03:12:45,284 --> 03:12:50,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Have we contemplated mandating tests if you want to remain in any kind of in-person instruction?

1136
03:12:51,128 --> 03:12:54,370
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my first question, and I'll ask my second once you answer that.

1137
03:12:54,910 --> 03:12:55,630
[SPEAKER_23]: Sure.

1138
03:12:56,271 --> 03:12:58,352
[SPEAKER_23]: So here's what I would say to that, Mr. So.

1139
03:12:58,592 --> 03:13:01,714
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that the question as to whether it's been contemplated

1140
03:13:02,438 --> 03:13:04,739
[SPEAKER_23]: uh, is yes, but we contemplate a lot of things.

1141
03:13:04,799 --> 03:13:06,120
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of things get discussed.

1142
03:13:06,600 --> 03:13:08,541
[SPEAKER_23]: I can say that I I've been in conversation.

1143
03:13:08,681 --> 03:13:22,228
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been present in conversations, uh, both with representatives from Desi and represented in our legal console, which we've discussed that, um, there are some variables that do distinguish our situation from Somerville.

1144
03:13:22,308 --> 03:13:29,172
[SPEAKER_23]: One of which is that the, our families, while they, there's some flexibility with regard to what, um,

1145
03:13:29,785 --> 03:13:39,433
[SPEAKER_23]: making a firm commitment by March 12th, by and large, the families of the Medford public schools have already made a commitment and a decision with regard to which cohort that they would be in.

1146
03:13:39,613 --> 03:13:54,285
[SPEAKER_23]: And so I think that the defensibility of a ex post facto condition on cohorts that families have committed to, I think does distinguish us from the Somerville example.

1147
03:13:55,066 --> 03:13:55,566
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not going to

1148
03:13:56,420 --> 03:14:03,766
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll pine myself as to whether what I think would be legal or not legal, but I will just say that that variable would be a significant challenge in and of itself.

1149
03:14:05,087 --> 03:14:05,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1150
03:14:05,628 --> 03:14:08,630
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to sort of play that out a bit.

1151
03:14:09,511 --> 03:14:24,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I know families, and they've reached out to me and probably many members, that they selected hybrid after much deliberation around the risks that they're willing to accept and the benefit that they get by sending their kid in.

1152
03:14:25,959 --> 03:14:37,283
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a completely unrelated to many families, a completely unrelated deliberation to going full-time with all the kids in the classroom.

1153
03:14:38,544 --> 03:14:54,650
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would just say that while I understand the need to solve the cohorting problem as described around attendance, and of course that makes sense to me, frankly, you know, the challenges around attendance we've been talking about since before even school started and the fact

1154
03:14:54,878 --> 03:14:57,399
[SPEAKER_14]: the systems couldn't handle a lot of the coding that we needed.

1155
03:14:58,079 --> 03:15:04,902
[SPEAKER_14]: But I will say that there are going to be families who will confirm hybrid.

1156
03:15:05,323 --> 03:15:14,927
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the day we are told that they have to be full time, you can fully expect they will be in Court D or they will be waiting for the police to show up to take their kid to school.

1157
03:15:15,467 --> 03:15:18,909
[SPEAKER_14]: And I literally saw that and heard that exact sentiment on Facebook.

1158
03:15:20,558 --> 03:15:34,205
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, families that were willing to deal with the risk of being in a class with two or three other kids, because some of those classes at the high school, you know, you've all looked around, sometimes it looks like there's nobody in there at all.

1159
03:15:35,646 --> 03:15:40,329
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the same as being in a classroom with twice or more kids.

1160
03:15:40,549 --> 03:15:46,392
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just, I think we need to be prepared that we're going to be looking at a huge bump in cohort D.

1161
03:15:49,910 --> 03:16:05,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, a huge bump in cohort D and be prepared for that because I think as certainly as a member, I will support families in their desire to do that because the decision to be hybrid is unrelated to the decision to be full-time in-person with all the classes.

1162
03:16:05,424 --> 03:16:10,589
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just really a statement which runs upon my second question, probably easier.

1163
03:16:15,331 --> 03:16:16,391
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Mr. Murphy.

1164
03:16:16,491 --> 03:16:18,892
[SPEAKER_23]: I may have lost Mr. says audio there at the very end.

1165
03:16:18,932 --> 03:16:23,534
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sure if that was just mine or not, but I think I heard enough of it to respond very briefly.

1166
03:16:23,554 --> 03:16:38,759
[SPEAKER_23]: I think there's a couple of, first of all, families, as the commissioner said, still have the right to choose the fully remote option and the sort of operational necessity of seeking cohort commitments at this stage.

1167
03:16:39,577 --> 03:16:53,147
[SPEAKER_23]: I hope is not viewed in any way as either being disrespectful or insensitive to the difficult decisions that families needed to make at the beginning of the school year and now need to make in terms of having a firm commitment for the final couple months of the school year.

1168
03:16:53,187 --> 03:16:54,168
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the first piece.

1169
03:16:54,628 --> 03:17:08,458
[SPEAKER_23]: The second piece, and I think this was referenced earlier by either the superintendent or Dr. Cushing, but this commitment that's being asked for by Friday, March 12th is not an indication that within the next week, secondary is going to be going

1170
03:17:09,282 --> 03:17:10,543
[SPEAKER_23]: more than two days a week.

1171
03:17:10,563 --> 03:17:14,366
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's still time in which the model will still be the same.

1172
03:17:14,786 --> 03:17:34,919
[SPEAKER_23]: The third thing I would say is that at no time, by and large, and there may be some exceptions, there always are, and I suspect there are within certain programs, but by and large, no one that made a commitment to cohort B or C should, generally speaking, should have expected to be in a room only with two students because

1173
03:17:36,484 --> 03:17:40,627
[SPEAKER_23]: 65% of thereabouts chose the hybrid option.

1174
03:17:41,027 --> 03:17:53,996
[SPEAKER_23]: The two or three students in a classroom is occurring in part because we have allowed for valid reasons, I think, a porousness amongst those cohorts because the instruction is concurrent.

1175
03:17:54,276 --> 03:18:01,021
[SPEAKER_23]: And so to a certain degree, you're not losing the exposure to instructional content if you're choosing to be remote for a day.

1176
03:18:01,561 --> 03:18:05,264
[SPEAKER_23]: So the need for stability is in part because

1177
03:18:05,748 --> 03:18:08,670
[SPEAKER_23]: we don't really want too many classrooms with only two or three students.

1178
03:18:09,070 --> 03:18:12,552
[SPEAKER_23]: And the final thing I would say is that, well, it's a two-parter.

1179
03:18:12,572 --> 03:18:13,773
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll make it quick, I promise, Mayor.

1180
03:18:14,653 --> 03:18:23,138
[SPEAKER_23]: One, you're not gonna be, no one's gonna be in a class with all of the students because we're still gonna have a cohort D with somewhere between 30 and 40% of the students.

1181
03:18:23,159 --> 03:18:34,946
[SPEAKER_23]: So there is a constituency of students that are not in person, which is good for occupancy restrictions, but also to the point that Mr. Rousseau was making about not necessarily wanting to be in a full room, that sort of,

1182
03:18:36,072 --> 03:18:39,314
[SPEAKER_23]: flexibility is still there as a result of that.

1183
03:18:40,115 --> 03:18:43,057
[SPEAKER_23]: And since I lost the second point there, I'm just going to end there.

1184
03:18:43,077 --> 03:18:48,440
[SPEAKER_23]: But those are, oh, the virus, there is a, I do think there's a variable with regard to the positivity in the community.

1185
03:18:48,821 --> 03:18:51,563
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, I'm not telling anyone what they should be worried about or not worried about.

1186
03:18:51,823 --> 03:18:58,527
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we have to be very respectful as to, you know, there's a variety of reasons that people's concern can be at a certain level.

1187
03:18:58,908 --> 03:19:05,372
[SPEAKER_23]: But it is, I do think a fact that we're at a different stage in the virus now than we were in September or August really.

1188
03:19:05,839 --> 03:19:17,845
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think my hope is that to some degree, while the risk is still there and we have to take it very seriously, hopefully there is a slightly higher degree of peace of mind that's coming with these decisions.

1189
03:19:19,205 --> 03:19:19,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1190
03:19:19,625 --> 03:19:24,448
[SPEAKER_14]: And my second question, whatever it was, was a super easy one, I hope.

1191
03:19:24,468 --> 03:19:24,888
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we

1192
03:19:27,785 --> 03:19:31,226
[SPEAKER_14]: anticipate having to send more kids in.

1193
03:19:31,266 --> 03:19:38,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard today from two different parents who send their kids into the high school with their own personal hotspots because the internet is just not capable.

1194
03:19:39,510 --> 03:19:55,977
[SPEAKER_14]: So whether it's one and a half or two and a half times as many students that are all gonna be on the internet at the same time, I hope we are already freaking out frankly to figure out how we can have sufficient internet for

1195
03:19:56,698 --> 03:20:19,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean

1196
03:20:27,063 --> 03:20:27,683
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I got it.

1197
03:20:27,763 --> 03:20:30,645
[SPEAKER_23]: It was it was chopping him and I'm pretty sure I was able to get enough of it.

1198
03:20:30,805 --> 03:20:31,545
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Murphy.

1199
03:20:31,585 --> 03:20:32,626
[SPEAKER_20]: That's very impressive.

1200
03:20:33,226 --> 03:20:34,867
[SPEAKER_23]: I live in reading lips.

1201
03:20:35,347 --> 03:20:43,111
[SPEAKER_23]: I think the issue is with regard to as increased students come in, are we going to have more problems or challenges with regard to our technology infrastructure.

1202
03:20:43,951 --> 03:20:46,492
[SPEAKER_23]: Our issue should not be a capacity one.

1203
03:20:46,973 --> 03:20:49,994
[SPEAKER_23]: There are additional risks that come in as we change those variables.

1204
03:20:50,484 --> 03:20:55,988
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's a greater impact, obviously, if the network shuts down in a building and there are more students in the building.

1205
03:20:56,008 --> 03:20:57,669
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's proportional in that sense.

1206
03:20:57,929 --> 03:21:07,876
[SPEAKER_23]: But due to the increased cabling and the increased capacity that we've experienced, the more students alone should not be a variable that exacerbates that risk.

1207
03:21:08,196 --> 03:21:12,519
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if Dr. Cushing wants to add anything on or if I've mischaracterized that.

1208
03:21:13,659 --> 03:21:15,582
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually it's a great characterization.

1209
03:21:15,602 --> 03:21:23,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I would ask that if anyone is having internet issues to have them contact the principal, myself.

1210
03:21:23,952 --> 03:21:33,143
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason why I ask that is we've really been able to see that a lot of the issues are with students who are bringing their personal devices that are then on the guest network.

1211
03:21:33,732 --> 03:21:37,734
[SPEAKER_08]: guest network in the event that there is some type of a problem.

1212
03:21:38,375 --> 03:21:53,244
[SPEAKER_08]: The guest network is the first thing that we cut loose and we maintain the district-owned Chromebooks, the district-owned MacBooks that teachers are using, and those types of devices to maintain the integrity and security of the network.

1213
03:21:54,004 --> 03:21:58,427
[SPEAKER_08]: A significant amount of resources have gone into upgrading the wireless network

1214
03:21:59,568 --> 03:22:03,830
[SPEAKER_08]: both in expanded hotspots and Cat6 wiring at the high school.

1215
03:22:05,450 --> 03:22:09,272
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask that those people reach out to us.

1216
03:22:09,652 --> 03:22:18,636
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it is a student device, then maybe we can swap out the student device, meaning the district-owned student device with a newer model.

1217
03:22:24,718 --> 03:22:27,699
[SPEAKER_24]: And yes, member Ruseau, I think you said you wanna follow up.

1218
03:22:30,144 --> 03:22:56,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we saying that, you know, over the summer as the entire planet tried to buy Chromebooks and other devices, and those of us that had the resources went out and spent $1,000 on a MacBook Air for our kids, so that there were in fact enough devices available for everybody else, that $1,000 investment, if I send my kids a Chromebook to dad, here's a $300 Chromebook instead?

1219
03:22:56,217 --> 03:22:57,198
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's really,

1220
03:22:57,557 --> 03:23:00,079
[SPEAKER_14]: can't be the message, because I'll be angry as a parent.

1221
03:23:00,099 --> 03:23:03,683
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't catch all that.

1222
03:23:03,743 --> 03:23:04,904
[SPEAKER_22]: That one I didn't get, I'm sorry.

1223
03:23:05,124 --> 03:23:07,546
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I didn't catch that.

1224
03:23:07,686 --> 03:23:09,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Is my audio really audible?

1225
03:23:10,469 --> 03:23:13,031
[SPEAKER_23]: That one, it was some key words that were missing.

1226
03:23:13,051 --> 03:23:15,733
[SPEAKER_23]: So if I try to respond to that one, I'm pretty sure I'm going to respond to the wrong question.

1227
03:23:17,595 --> 03:23:22,219
[SPEAKER_23]: But if it's that, we feel confident with regard to the investments we made.

1228
03:23:22,720 --> 03:23:24,041
[SPEAKER_23]: And to Dr. Cushing's point,

1229
03:23:24,900 --> 03:23:35,087
[SPEAKER_23]: given those investments, the district-owned devices should not be an issue with regard to the network, we don't think.

1230
03:23:35,828 --> 03:23:37,409
[SPEAKER_23]: And that has been the case thus far.

1231
03:23:40,911 --> 03:23:41,111
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that?

1232
03:23:41,972 --> 03:23:49,377
[SPEAKER_08]: We did also, I mean, to part of the point, we did expand the guest network's capacity

1233
03:23:51,583 --> 03:24:06,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, I don't wanna say specifically, but I know that in conversations, I forget how we expanded it, but we did widen the bandwidth significantly to allow for student devices that students were bringing in personally.

1234
03:24:07,326 --> 03:24:17,488
[SPEAKER_08]: What I am saying is when the network suffers a security threat, generally speaking, that threat is coming through the guest network

1235
03:24:18,228 --> 03:24:33,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And generally speaking, that is where we will eliminate the opportunity for a threat in order to preserve academic operations for mainly for our teachers who are then broadcasting out remote to those students who are at home.

1236
03:24:34,364 --> 03:24:42,792
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a multifaceted problem that we've discovered that the primary source of any type of a security risk

1237
03:24:43,536 --> 03:24:52,384
[SPEAKER_08]: is through the Guest Network, which we expanded and opened up to give students, like you said, who bought their own devices the opportunity to be able to use them.

1238
03:24:53,284 --> 03:25:11,259
[SPEAKER_23]: And just with regard to that multifaceted effort, we've also added security features to the Guest Network and are increasing that, essentially the screens or firewalls that are around that network so that we can have even less exposure than we have had currently, because that is where we've identified

1239
03:25:13,061 --> 03:25:14,021
[SPEAKER_23]: the most of those challenges.

1240
03:25:18,142 --> 03:25:18,422
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1241
03:25:18,442 --> 03:25:19,122
[SPEAKER_24]: Member van de Kloot.

1242
03:25:20,102 --> 03:25:20,383
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1243
03:25:21,083 --> 03:25:23,783
[SPEAKER_27]: Please let me know if my audio starts going bad.

1244
03:25:23,803 --> 03:25:27,144
[SPEAKER_27]: I noted tonight we've had more audio problems than usual.

1245
03:25:27,264 --> 03:25:28,204
[SPEAKER_27]: So let me know.

1246
03:25:28,224 --> 03:25:36,126
[SPEAKER_27]: I am reading, received a letter to the school committee account from a parent, Adrianne Preby.

1247
03:25:37,166 --> 03:25:41,027
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to paraphrase it since many of the things were answered, but I think it's important for

1248
03:25:42,608 --> 03:25:43,849
[SPEAKER_27]: you to hear her viewpoint.

1249
03:25:44,769 --> 03:25:47,711
[SPEAKER_27]: She says, my name is Adrienne Preby of 61 Locust Street.

1250
03:25:48,492 --> 03:25:52,315
[SPEAKER_27]: I sent this to school administrators but did not receive a reply, so I'm sending it here.

1251
03:25:53,075 --> 03:26:04,683
[SPEAKER_27]: The decision to take away a family's choice in switching back and forth from hybrid to remote as they feel is safest for them due to the ever-shifting nature of COVID case counts as a clear breach of trust of families.

1252
03:26:05,124 --> 03:26:08,186
[SPEAKER_27]: How exactly do you intend to enforce this policy after March 18th?

1253
03:26:10,037 --> 03:26:13,478
[SPEAKER_27]: She does ask whether we have considered asking a waiver.

1254
03:26:14,078 --> 03:26:29,421
[SPEAKER_27]: I think most importantly, though, the thing I want to mention is she says, additionally, all communications about this new policy only add that families will be able to remain fully remote as an afterthought, barely emphasizing this crucial fact.

1255
03:26:31,621 --> 03:26:35,642
[SPEAKER_27]: And she feels that this is trying to pressure families into choosing the in-person learning model.

1256
03:26:36,178 --> 03:26:56,137
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm not certain, I don't, I know what exactly, you know, whether that was the last thing said or the first, but I just wanna make it clear that to parents that they can choose the remote model and we're anticipating that they could stay in the remote model to the end of this year, is that correct?

1257
03:26:56,677 --> 03:26:59,020
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what the commissioner said and that's our position as well.

1258
03:26:59,680 --> 03:27:01,322
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, thank you.

1259
03:27:03,174 --> 03:27:07,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Member van de Kloot, I would also say that at no time this year have we pressured anybody.

1260
03:27:07,897 --> 03:27:16,223
[SPEAKER_08]: We have maintained that these are family choices dependent upon family situations, dependent on the medical situations.

1261
03:27:16,404 --> 03:27:25,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And at no time have we pressured anyone to do anything other than hopefully get tested through the school's program, please do that.

1262
03:27:26,251 --> 03:27:27,812
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is your choice.

1263
03:27:28,544 --> 03:27:35,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess the best way to say it is it's a menu option that the state provided to us.

1264
03:27:35,706 --> 03:27:39,506
[SPEAKER_08]: They are now removing potentially that menu option.

1265
03:27:40,146 --> 03:27:52,729
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you want to order off menu, there could be consequences for a district that expressly allows hybrid moving forward.

1266
03:27:53,229 --> 03:27:56,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we are not forcing anyone to make a choice.

1267
03:27:56,840 --> 03:28:10,069
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, so I really think that what she's saying is that because maybe in our communication, she saw the emphasis on yes, you can stay fully remote as maybe not front and center at the beginning.

1268
03:28:10,710 --> 03:28:13,252
[SPEAKER_23]: But I think we've made it clear tonight.

1269
03:28:13,292 --> 03:28:26,521
[SPEAKER_23]: I would just say respectfully, it's not front and center because the folks that have chosen cohorts B or C are having this variable, a significant variable changed from how they're currently operating.

1270
03:28:27,082 --> 03:28:34,888
[SPEAKER_23]: And so as Dr. Cushing said, and as we've said, I think in every presentation we've made, yes, they definitely have the option.

1271
03:28:35,528 --> 03:28:56,103
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's an option that we as an organization respect to remain in cohort D. This communication, and I think the subsequent communications, including to the robocalls and letters that went out today or on Friday, are emphasizing the changed variable for the constituency that we know is affected.

1272
03:28:56,519 --> 03:29:07,224
[SPEAKER_23]: It may very well be the case that some individuals and cohorts B and C choose as a result of the deadline in the prospect of being in more than two days a week, choose to go remote.

1273
03:29:07,564 --> 03:29:10,885
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, that's a choice that- I understand all this.

1274
03:29:11,005 --> 03:29:17,248
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm just relaying that the parent feels that this change is not something she's happy with.

1275
03:29:17,628 --> 03:29:20,829
[SPEAKER_27]: And she did not feel that it was emphasized that she could stay.

1276
03:29:21,169 --> 03:29:21,910
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all I'm saying.

1277
03:29:21,990 --> 03:29:22,350
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree.

1278
03:29:22,370 --> 03:29:23,270
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think it was.

1279
03:29:23,430 --> 03:29:24,871
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not a point of- Her words, not mine.

1280
03:29:26,011 --> 03:29:28,893
[SPEAKER_23]: That is not a point of emphasis in this communication.

1281
03:29:29,253 --> 03:29:30,554
[SPEAKER_23]: That is a true statement.

1282
03:29:32,875 --> 03:29:34,656
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, both.

1283
03:29:35,417 --> 03:29:48,544
[SPEAKER_24]: Number six, we have recommendation to approve memorandum of agreement between the Medford Public Schools and the Medford Paraprofessionals Association governing working conditions for the 2020-2021 school year.

1284
03:29:49,004 --> 03:29:50,205
[SPEAKER_24]: Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.

1285
03:29:51,417 --> 03:30:15,264
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, so similar to our teachers MOA, the paraprofessional MOA is finally being ratified or to officially announce the working conditions that the paras have been working under since the school year began.

1286
03:30:15,885 --> 03:30:20,026
[SPEAKER_28]: And so this is really a request to approve

1287
03:30:20,666 --> 03:30:25,548
[SPEAKER_28]: the MOA and just to confirm the work that has been taking place all year.

1288
03:30:30,030 --> 03:30:32,171
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

1289
03:30:35,152 --> 03:30:35,952
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion?

1290
03:30:39,173 --> 03:30:39,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Motion to approve.

1291
03:30:40,634 --> 03:30:43,755
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to approve by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

1292
03:30:44,075 --> 03:30:44,496
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call.

1293
03:30:51,218 --> 03:30:51,759
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1294
03:30:52,359 --> 03:30:52,739
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1295
03:30:53,000 --> 03:30:53,220
Yes.

1296
03:31:22,926 --> 03:31:24,828
[SPEAKER_24]: unmute yourself member van de Koop, please.

1297
03:31:28,272 --> 03:31:28,512
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1298
03:31:29,393 --> 03:31:29,713
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1299
03:31:30,074 --> 03:31:30,915
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1300
03:31:31,916 --> 03:31:33,878
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1301
03:31:34,178 --> 03:31:35,179
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

1302
03:31:35,199 --> 03:31:41,686
[SPEAKER_24]: Number seven, update on Medford High School restroom renovation project.

1303
03:31:41,987 --> 03:31:43,008
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. David Murphy.

1304
03:31:45,759 --> 03:31:46,660
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mayor.

1305
03:31:47,300 --> 03:31:55,664
[SPEAKER_23]: Just to tack on to that last agenda, we do want to extend our gratitude to the Paraprofessional Association for their work on negotiating the MOA.

1306
03:31:55,684 --> 03:32:02,887
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not uncommon for the units with fewer members to sometimes have to sort of wait in a queue.

1307
03:32:02,987 --> 03:32:14,152
[SPEAKER_23]: And their patience and their work on this and their team, I just do want to say that we're grateful to them for their work, both in the classroom on a daily basis, but also in finalizing that agreement.

1308
03:32:15,118 --> 03:32:24,944
[SPEAKER_23]: With regard to the restrooms renovation project, we touched upon this at our previous meeting and it was a subject of conversation at the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee.

1309
03:32:25,825 --> 03:32:35,471
[SPEAKER_23]: We have made progress in that we've scheduled a meeting with the architect who provided the initial specifications and have met with the city's procurement office.

1310
03:32:36,151 --> 03:32:43,276
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll be meeting with the architect in person here at the high school on Wednesday, both to take a walkthrough of the

1311
03:32:44,764 --> 03:33:06,138
[SPEAKER_23]: relevant restrooms and to spell out the additional specification that we need and that we've been advised needs to be included in the invitation to bid under chapter 149 that we're hopeful will be issued within the next, I'm gonna say a week, although I may be getting a little ahead of the procurement office and I don't wanna do that.

1312
03:33:06,238 --> 03:33:11,581
[SPEAKER_23]: So within the next one to two weeks, we expect that invitation to bid will be issued.

1313
03:33:12,305 --> 03:33:21,891
[SPEAKER_23]: There are a few other strategic decisions that need to be made, including whether the architect will be retained to provide a degree of project oversight with regard to that.

1314
03:33:22,271 --> 03:33:34,879
[SPEAKER_23]: And as I believe was referenced at the previous meeting, there will be decisions for the school committee likely in the near future with regard to whether the scope of the project should be expanded to encompass additional restrooms.

1315
03:33:34,939 --> 03:33:39,402
[SPEAKER_23]: Right now, the quote that was received when this project began last spring

1316
03:33:39,810 --> 03:33:43,673
[SPEAKER_23]: Harmon Zuckerman, PB — He, Him, His): Was with regard to a set of restrooms on the second floor of see building.

1317
03:33:44,374 --> 03:33:45,554
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what the quote was for.

1318
03:33:45,875 --> 03:34:01,507
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what as of today, the invitation to bid under Chapter 149 would be based on Harmon Zuckerman, PB — He, Him, His): And we're going to include in our conversations with the architect this week as to what variables, if any, would have to be modified if the scope of that bid were to expand the

1319
03:34:02,102 --> 03:34:10,184
[SPEAKER_23]: The likelihood, those of us that have looked at the project and have been digging through the specifications, is that the bathrooms are nearly identical.

1320
03:34:10,944 --> 03:34:12,105
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we have a general sense.

1321
03:34:12,145 --> 03:34:19,227
[SPEAKER_23]: The question is really whether, if scaled up, there could be some savings realized through efficiency.

1322
03:34:19,767 --> 03:34:24,328
[SPEAKER_23]: But that's a decision that we'll come back to the committee with to discuss sometime in the coming weeks.

1323
03:34:30,520 --> 03:34:32,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much, Mr. Murphy.

1324
03:34:32,501 --> 03:34:33,521
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. McLaughlin.

1325
03:34:33,641 --> 03:34:37,983
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know the Buildings and Grounds Committee through Membercrats worked on this as well.

1326
03:34:38,523 --> 03:34:38,883
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1327
03:34:41,844 --> 03:34:46,486
[SPEAKER_24]: We have number eight report on user fees for athletics, Dr. Peter Cushing and Mr. Bob Maloney.

1328
03:34:46,506 --> 03:34:49,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

1329
03:34:49,727 --> 03:34:51,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for allowing us to speak on this issue.

1330
03:34:52,648 --> 03:34:57,770
[SPEAKER_08]: As you may or may not be aware, within the state athletics, there was a shift

1331
03:34:58,482 --> 03:35:16,709
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, while many well most I shouldn't say many well most high schools athletics programs have participated in some manner shape or form, this year, the greater Boston League is only beginning play, as of this past weekend.

1332
03:35:18,089 --> 03:35:28,574
[SPEAKER_08]: We had several of our member schools were in the red and some of those school districts have not returned students to any in person learning at this time.

1333
03:35:30,314 --> 03:35:37,097
[SPEAKER_08]: So the league chose to stick together and we are currently operating on three six week seasons.

1334
03:35:37,357 --> 03:35:38,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, we are in the winter season.

1335
03:35:40,193 --> 03:35:48,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Girls hockey and girls gymnastics, I'm sorry, gymnastics and girls hockey have participated because they're part of statewide leagues.

1336
03:35:48,340 --> 03:35:58,929
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if we had waited for them to play, they would have essentially missed their opportunity to have any competition, as other schools are currently moving to what is called spring to

1337
03:36:01,923 --> 03:36:17,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Given the variables that we were facing this year, and not knowing whether or not students would even have an opportunity to participate in athletics, and our student athletes are facing significantly reduced opportunities to play.

1338
03:36:17,552 --> 03:36:30,580
[SPEAKER_08]: As one example in the report, girls hockey would typically have 20 games, two scrimmages, and the opportunity for multiple games in post-season play, depending on how well they move forward.

1339
03:36:31,283 --> 03:36:39,654
[SPEAKER_08]: This year they participated in 14 games and their ice time was reduced from five days per week to three days per week.

1340
03:36:39,734 --> 03:36:44,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Maloney has another example to share with our girls JV basketball players.

1341
03:36:46,411 --> 03:36:54,096
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, we just started basketball last week at this time, girls junior varsity basketball program at a game schedule.

1342
03:36:55,917 --> 03:37:04,783
[SPEAKER_30]: This week we were notified that Revere, Walden, Somerville, Lynn Classical, Lynn English, they do not have enough girls to have two teams.

1343
03:37:05,644 --> 03:37:10,928
[SPEAKER_30]: So currently right now our girls junior varsity basketball team has only three games on their schedule.

1344
03:37:12,628 --> 03:37:16,629
[SPEAKER_30]: We're going to try to do everything in our power to double up and get them some more games.

1345
03:37:16,749 --> 03:37:21,751
[SPEAKER_30]: But as everybody knows on this call, it's a moving target.

1346
03:37:21,831 --> 03:37:23,091
[SPEAKER_30]: Things are changing every day.

1347
03:37:23,111 --> 03:37:31,754
[SPEAKER_30]: And the athletes, we're going to try to give them some kind of sense of a season this year, but it's not a normal season.

1348
03:37:33,982 --> 03:37:41,571
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're requesting, given the significantly reduced schedules, normally your seasons would be about 12 weeks.

1349
03:37:41,631 --> 03:37:43,113
[SPEAKER_08]: We're down to six week schedules.

1350
03:37:44,354 --> 03:37:50,482
[SPEAKER_08]: We're asking for the school committee to waive the user fee for our student athletes.

1351
03:37:54,543 --> 03:37:55,284
[SPEAKER_27]: Member van de Kloot.

1352
03:37:56,144 --> 03:37:56,324
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1353
03:37:56,404 --> 03:37:59,807
[SPEAKER_27]: So the question is, um, uh, I think this is great.

1354
03:38:00,207 --> 03:38:02,789
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, I'd like to be able to wave them all the time.

1355
03:38:03,229 --> 03:38:06,531
[SPEAKER_27]: What's the financial impact and how are we going to cover the loss?

1356
03:38:08,453 --> 03:38:19,280
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have, um, there will be significantly reduced, um, costs in transportation, um, due to the number of games that are not being played.

1357
03:38:19,858 --> 03:38:25,780
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a substantial reduction in the amount of ice time that is available to students and therefore that we are paying for.

1358
03:38:27,161 --> 03:38:30,802
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be cost savings when we look at reconditioning of equipment.

1359
03:38:32,203 --> 03:38:36,524
[SPEAKER_08]: For football, there will not be a need to recondition the equipment given the shortened season.

1360
03:38:37,805 --> 03:38:46,528
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be certain equipment that was purchased last year for last year's spring sports that will be carried over into this year and will need to be purchased.

1361
03:38:47,408 --> 03:38:48,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Maloney, other ideas?

1362
03:38:50,165 --> 03:38:58,049
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, we're gonna save officials across the board site workers, probably police details, because we're not gonna have any fans that game.

1363
03:38:58,089 --> 03:39:00,570
[SPEAKER_30]: So there's gonna be a savings across the board.

1364
03:39:00,630 --> 03:39:05,653
[SPEAKER_30]: And we're confident that the budget that you gave the athletic department in July will cover this.

1365
03:39:05,673 --> 03:39:10,556
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, that's, that's great.

1366
03:39:10,836 --> 03:39:13,497
[SPEAKER_27]: I make a motion to approve the recommendation.

1367
03:39:14,338 --> 03:39:16,799
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval by member van de Kloot seconded by

1368
03:39:19,659 --> 03:39:19,779
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1369
03:39:19,799 --> 03:39:20,079
[SPEAKER_24]: Stone.

1370
03:39:21,080 --> 03:39:21,340
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

1371
03:39:21,360 --> 03:39:22,341
[SPEAKER_24]: Stone, roll call.

[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1377
03:39:34,707 --> 03:39:35,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Mustone.

1378
03:39:35,748 --> 03:39:36,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1379
03:39:37,649 --> 03:39:38,429
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau.

1380
03:39:38,770 --> 03:39:40,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1383
03:39:43,472 --> 03:39:44,273
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1384
03:39:44,693 --> 03:39:44,933
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1385
03:39:44,993 --> 03:39:46,474
[SPEAKER_24]: Seven the affirmative, zero the negative.

1386
03:39:47,634 --> 03:39:48,435
[SPEAKER_24]: Number eight passes.

1387
03:39:49,500 --> 03:39:49,820
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1388
03:39:49,840 --> 03:39:50,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1389
03:39:52,863 --> 03:39:56,045
[SPEAKER_24]: We have old business.

1390
03:39:57,827 --> 03:40:11,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Number one, the annual reports and presentations schedule policy will be amended to change the frequency of the tiered focus monitoring presentation in section three, scheduled from annually to every three years offered by member Ruseau.

1391
03:40:11,878 --> 03:40:12,399
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Ruseau.

1392
03:40:13,516 --> 03:40:15,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, I believe this is self-evident.

1393
03:40:16,018 --> 03:40:18,620
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just an error in the original policy we approved.

1394
03:40:19,220 --> 03:40:21,262
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's no conversation.

1395
03:40:21,882 --> 03:40:25,585
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval by member Ruseau, seconded by member- Second.

1396
03:40:25,765 --> 03:40:27,366
[SPEAKER_24]: Graham, roll call, please.

1397
03:40:32,290 --> 03:40:32,990
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Graham.

03:40:33,651 --> 03:40:33,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

03:40:35,632 --> 03:40:36,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Prentz.

1400
03:40:45,464 --> 03:40:47,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, my dog was barking, yes.

1401
03:40:48,905 --> 03:40:50,045
[SPEAKER_20]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1402
03:40:50,125 --> 03:40:50,845
[SPEAKER_20]: Member McDowell.

1403
03:40:53,046 --> 03:40:53,346
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1404
03:40:54,426 --> 03:40:55,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau.

1405
03:40:56,487 --> 03:40:56,687
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1406
03:40:57,907 --> 03:40:58,707
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Van der Kloot.

1407
03:40:59,087 --> 03:40:59,328
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1408
03:41:00,428 --> 03:41:01,208
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1409
03:41:02,088 --> 03:41:03,789
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1410
03:41:05,489 --> 03:41:06,289
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

1411
03:41:07,069 --> 03:41:08,950
[SPEAKER_24]: Number nine, communications.

1412
03:41:11,050 --> 03:41:12,931
[SPEAKER_24]: And number 10, we have new business.

1413
03:41:14,842 --> 03:41:23,624
[SPEAKER_24]: First up member McLaughlin motion to include the school committee voting tally sheet as part of the regular school committee public record with posting to website.

1414
03:41:24,584 --> 03:41:26,185
[SPEAKER_24]: To the website on a regular basis.

1415
03:41:27,465 --> 03:41:29,265
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval, or would you like to speak on it?

1416
03:41:30,866 --> 03:41:33,186
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval by member McLaughlin, seconded by.

1417
03:41:33,206 --> 03:41:35,047
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question.

1418
03:41:35,307 --> 03:41:38,288
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to second it to actually member Ruseau.

1419
03:41:39,088 --> 03:41:40,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm I'm.

1420
03:41:41,328 --> 03:41:43,849
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm understanding this to be the you know the

1421
03:41:44,773 --> 03:41:50,616
[SPEAKER_14]: what we did in person, the pieces of paper, where you would write the motion and say who voted for what.

1422
03:41:52,277 --> 03:41:52,817
[SPEAKER_24]: May I, ma'am?

1423
03:41:53,177 --> 03:41:54,118
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1424
03:41:54,798 --> 03:41:57,119
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, this is a tally sheet, Excel spreadsheet.

1425
03:41:57,159 --> 03:41:59,681
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been sending it for the past couple of meetings.

1426
03:41:59,701 --> 03:42:00,961
[SPEAKER_20]: If you haven't gotten it, let me know.

1427
03:42:01,502 --> 03:42:02,922
[SPEAKER_20]: I sent it through Google share.

1428
03:42:03,723 --> 03:42:11,547
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's actually a Google spreadsheet, not Excel, and it's a list of the motions and how each member voted on the motion, whether the motion was approved.

1429
03:42:14,042 --> 03:42:14,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Good second that.

1430
03:42:16,663 --> 03:42:18,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, sorry, a quick, sorry, more quick question.

1431
03:42:20,084 --> 03:42:25,425
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure we, are we keeping a separate sheet for executive session votes so that we don't accidentally post that to the public?

1432
03:42:26,445 --> 03:42:30,566
[SPEAKER_20]: That was actually what I had asked during the executive session when we were in session.

1433
03:42:31,427 --> 03:42:33,927
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I can amend that motion.

1434
03:42:34,527 --> 03:42:40,349
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, yeah, I can amend this motion to keep a separate tally for executive session.

1435
03:42:42,478 --> 03:42:46,862
[SPEAKER_24]: approval by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Ruseau, amended by member McLaughlin.

1436
03:42:47,883 --> 03:42:48,283
[SPEAKER_24]: Roll call.

1437
03:42:49,144 --> 03:42:49,604
[SPEAKER_20]: Please.

1438
03:42:51,005 --> 03:42:51,586
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Graham.

1439
03:42:52,126 --> 03:42:52,367
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1440
03:42:53,387 --> 03:42:54,208
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Kreatz.

1441
03:42:58,712 --> 03:42:58,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1442
03:42:59,753 --> 03:43:01,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1443
03:43:01,194 --> 03:43:01,975
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Mustone.

1444
03:43:02,615 --> 03:43:02,916
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1445
03:43:03,857 --> 03:43:04,637
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau.

1446
03:43:05,478 --> 03:43:05,798
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1447
03:43:06,759 --> 03:43:07,660
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Van der Kloot.

1448
03:43:07,920 --> 03:43:08,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1449
03:43:09,321 --> 03:43:10,042
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1450
03:43:10,489 --> 03:43:13,071
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, seven the affirmative, zero the negative, paper passes.

1451
03:43:21,036 --> 03:43:29,202
[SPEAKER_24]: Our next two are pretty lengthy, so bear with me, please.

1452
03:43:33,105 --> 03:43:40,290
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to use the following guidelines at the March 10th, 2021 Committee of the Whole meeting with purpose of forming an advisory committee

1453
03:43:40,851 --> 03:43:42,751
[SPEAKER_24]: to rename the Columbus Elementary School.

1454
03:43:43,151 --> 03:43:45,772
[SPEAKER_24]: First up is offered by Member Ruseau.

1455
03:43:47,932 --> 03:43:48,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Member Ruseau.

1456
03:43:49,533 --> 03:43:58,854
[SPEAKER_13]: In light of the fact that the resolutions are actually on the agenda, I would motion to skip the reading, if there's interest in that.

1457
03:44:00,794 --> 03:44:01,715
[SPEAKER_24]: How does the committee feel?

1458
03:44:01,795 --> 03:44:07,756
[SPEAKER_24]: I know there's a lot of people on, we have 120 people, so I'm sure if- Mayor.

1459
03:44:08,056 --> 03:44:09,556
[SPEAKER_24]: Emails, yes, Member Vandekloot.

1460
03:44:10,674 --> 03:44:15,878
[SPEAKER_27]: So first, I do want to, we held off some letters from the beginning.

1461
03:44:16,098 --> 03:44:17,699
[SPEAKER_27]: And so I do want to comment on those.

1462
03:44:18,579 --> 03:44:30,927
[SPEAKER_27]: However, before I read those, I'm just going to say, I understood the purposes of putting the, that member Rousseau told me was that his purpose was to send his resolution to the committee of the whole on Wednesday.

1463
03:44:31,407 --> 03:44:34,729
[SPEAKER_27]: And so I submitted mine as well, so that it would go to the committee of the whole.

1464
03:44:36,680 --> 03:44:56,114
[SPEAKER_27]: Resolutions that are put forth just to explain to our viewers are to work out, hammer out a procedure for an advisory council and also a timeline for the renaming of the Columbus School, which was voted on back in June.

1465
03:44:57,255 --> 03:45:02,539
[SPEAKER_27]: They are very lengthy because there are many important issues in this.

1466
03:45:04,528 --> 03:45:05,208
[SPEAKER_27]: in the question.

1467
03:45:05,789 --> 03:45:14,274
[SPEAKER_27]: So my intent was that it was not going to be discussed line by line tonight, but that I wanted everybody to get a chance to see it.

1468
03:45:14,814 --> 03:45:16,975
[SPEAKER_27]: I do have great concerns about the timing.

1469
03:45:17,696 --> 03:45:21,758
[SPEAKER_27]: I mentioned that tonight, but I'm sure we'll be talking about that on Wednesday.

1470
03:45:22,678 --> 03:45:28,822
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, we received some letters regarding the Columbus issue

1471
03:45:30,709 --> 03:45:45,376
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to, the first one received was from Betsy Lister and long time resident.

1472
03:45:47,157 --> 03:45:48,698
[SPEAKER_27]: I thought I saw Betsy on.

1473
03:45:48,858 --> 03:45:52,059
[SPEAKER_27]: She actually did not put her address on here.

1474
03:45:52,100 --> 03:45:52,880
[SPEAKER_27]: Is Betsy on?

1475
03:45:55,933 --> 03:45:58,434
[SPEAKER_24]: You can still summarize her comments.

1476
03:45:58,994 --> 03:46:05,015
[SPEAKER_27]: She is a long time, four decades, Medford resident, a business owner in town for over 20 years.

1477
03:46:06,936 --> 03:46:07,576
[SPEAKER_21]: Member Ruseau?

1478
03:46:08,496 --> 03:46:11,497
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that it's really appropriate to read all of the text.

1479
03:46:11,637 --> 03:46:13,577
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm concerned that the summarization.

1480
03:46:13,597 --> 03:46:15,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I will do that.

1481
03:46:15,958 --> 03:46:17,979
[SPEAKER_27]: Member Vidikul, how many emails do you have?

1482
03:46:19,059 --> 03:46:23,200
[SPEAKER_27]: I think there's three now, but another one on a different topic has come in.

1483
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:26,502
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, so let's read the three in the Columbus School.

1484
03:46:26,882 --> 03:46:27,662
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, to all.

1485
03:46:28,223 --> 03:46:33,026
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been a long time, four decades, Medford resident, business owner in town for over 28 years.

1486
03:46:33,046 --> 03:46:43,031
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm a past president of what was known as the Salem Street Business Association for three years, a past board member of Temple Shalom here in the city, and my son went to the Columbus School.

1487
03:46:43,672 --> 03:46:50,356
[SPEAKER_27]: The direction I see the city going in is one that will hold terrible consequences for the children and grandchildren of future generations,

1488
03:46:50,956 --> 03:46:51,517
[SPEAKER_27]: of the city.

1489
03:46:51,997 --> 03:47:06,570
[SPEAKER_27]: This Marxist-communistic leftist agenda that's being forced down the throats of parents and children is heinous, contains so much hatred and racial divide, it's out and outright despicable and has no business in the city, never mind the school system.

1490
03:47:07,151 --> 03:47:10,975
[SPEAKER_27]: Why on earth are children not being taught the important things that will get them through life?

1491
03:47:11,455 --> 03:47:16,780
[SPEAKER_27]: Why are they being indoctrinated into a narrative that's full of hate and divides people by color and social status?

1492
03:47:17,580 --> 03:47:20,781
[SPEAKER_27]: Why are they being taught about BLM and Antifa?

1493
03:47:21,181 --> 03:47:27,103
[SPEAKER_27]: Why not teach them our history as it happens so that they will know not to repeat it in the future to be learning from the past?

1494
03:47:27,903 --> 03:47:31,124
[SPEAKER_27]: All men are created equal, says the Constitution.

1495
03:47:31,524 --> 03:47:34,225
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's what we should be taught in school, period.

1496
03:47:34,545 --> 03:47:36,925
[SPEAKER_27]: Not divide by skin color or ethnic background.

1497
03:47:36,965 --> 03:47:40,186
[SPEAKER_27]: They are all children and children love unless they are taught otherwise.

1498
03:47:40,706 --> 03:47:42,627
[SPEAKER_27]: And teaching hatred in school has no business

1499
03:47:44,653 --> 03:47:45,493
[SPEAKER_27]: being there at all.

1500
03:47:45,773 --> 03:47:52,495
[SPEAKER_27]: Teach the children they are all equal and to love one another and their neighbors, not to put a line of division between themselves and others.

1501
03:47:53,135 --> 03:47:56,556
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm disgusted with the new rev, that and they all need to go.

1502
03:47:56,696 --> 03:48:03,838
[SPEAKER_27]: In fact, I'm thinking the entire school committee needs to be dissolved immediately because it's harming the children by dividing the community unnecessarily.

1503
03:48:04,278 --> 03:48:05,119
[SPEAKER_27]: We're better than that.

1504
03:48:05,459 --> 03:48:09,380
[SPEAKER_27]: I doubt that the majority of Medford parents want their children brought up with Marxist beliefs.

1505
03:48:10,200 --> 03:48:19,468
[SPEAKER_27]: We already know that academia consists of 98% liberals and the rest conservatives, so that should be addressed as well so that children's minds are not poisoned any further.

1506
03:48:19,488 --> 03:48:22,110
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a very long letter.

1507
03:48:23,511 --> 03:48:24,852
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, that was my own comment.

1508
03:48:25,512 --> 03:48:28,635
[SPEAKER_27]: Recently, I heard an audio clip of an eighth grade class with their teacher.

1509
03:48:28,815 --> 03:48:30,817
[SPEAKER_27]: He asked them if they knew who Helen Keller was.

1510
03:48:31,257 --> 03:48:34,339
[SPEAKER_27]: The response ranged from a man and a German spy.

1511
03:48:34,720 --> 03:48:37,402
[SPEAKER_27]: Only one child in the entire classroom said, oh, that was

1512
03:48:38,792 --> 03:48:39,733
[SPEAKER_27]: that blind person.

1513
03:48:39,873 --> 03:48:42,795
[SPEAKER_27]: By the way, she's not referring to a Medford classroom.

1514
03:48:43,476 --> 03:48:49,882
[SPEAKER_27]: The teacher then required if any of the children knew who Hitler was and they were clueless, no idea, and couldn't respond at all.

1515
03:48:50,142 --> 03:48:52,484
[SPEAKER_27]: Imagine not knowing who Hitler was in the eighth grade.

1516
03:48:53,245 --> 03:48:56,648
[SPEAKER_27]: And finally, he asked, do you know what D-Day is?

1517
03:48:56,949 --> 03:48:58,270
[SPEAKER_27]: And the answer was a rapper.

1518
03:48:59,022 --> 03:49:00,122
[SPEAKER_27]: Think about that for a minute.

1519
03:49:00,462 --> 03:49:01,643
[SPEAKER_27]: What are our kids being taught?

1520
03:49:02,183 --> 03:49:05,104
[SPEAKER_27]: Items of importance or a leftist Marxist agenda?

1521
03:49:05,804 --> 03:49:06,984
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not a perfect person.

1522
03:49:07,145 --> 03:49:12,466
[SPEAKER_27]: I've sinned in my life and I have enough sense to know what I'm seeing being pushed through in Medford schools is just wrong.

1523
03:49:13,066 --> 03:49:21,429
[SPEAKER_27]: And although I'm not a Christian, I believe that most parents would agree that what's being taught in the Medford school system doesn't go along with their Christian or Judaic values.

1524
03:49:21,929 --> 03:49:24,670
[SPEAKER_27]: Seems the leftist took God out of the schools to shame.

1525
03:49:26,348 --> 03:49:30,050
[SPEAKER_27]: And as for the Columbus School renaming goes, there's no reason at all to change the name.

1526
03:49:30,230 --> 03:49:33,911
[SPEAKER_27]: I know Andrea Bocelli is quite the performer, but he means nothing to me at all.

1527
03:49:34,411 --> 03:49:38,253
[SPEAKER_27]: Nor do I think who he is makes any sense to plaster his name on an educational building.

1528
03:49:38,693 --> 03:49:40,394
[SPEAKER_27]: This is not Disney, nor is it Hollywood.

1529
03:49:40,414 --> 03:49:43,655
[SPEAKER_27]: And the name Columbus has served the school very well for decades upon decades.

1530
03:49:44,276 --> 03:49:47,457
[SPEAKER_27]: For all of his sins, he's the reason most of us are here for crying out loud.

1531
03:49:47,517 --> 03:49:51,739
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the senseless and waste our time and poses a distraction to the real issue.

1532
03:49:52,079 --> 03:49:54,880
[SPEAKER_27]: What's being taught to the children in the direction that the city is going.

1533
03:49:56,854 --> 03:50:01,457
[SPEAKER_27]: We have elected a mayor who has turned her back on the people who elected her and chooses to do her personal bidding.

1534
03:50:05,821 --> 03:50:06,821
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

1535
03:50:07,602 --> 03:50:10,584
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, there's a level of, yeah.

1536
03:50:13,878 --> 03:50:15,220
[SPEAKER_27]: Not on our own political stance.

1537
03:50:15,260 --> 03:50:18,302
[SPEAKER_27]: Take a knee for BLM, but do not support your own police.

1538
03:50:18,342 --> 03:50:18,603
[SPEAKER_27]: Hmm.

1539
03:50:19,403 --> 03:50:21,345
[SPEAKER_27]: How many want to see this divide that's happening?

1540
03:50:21,445 --> 03:50:22,566
[SPEAKER_27]: I doubt not the majority.

1541
03:50:22,666 --> 03:50:24,208
[SPEAKER_27]: Hell, if I'm wrong, let me know.

1542
03:50:24,228 --> 03:50:34,637
[SPEAKER_27]: I was the support the police rally, and when you have children screaming, blank the police, and creating a scene and spewing hatred everywhere, it was disgusting, and everybody was shocked.

1543
03:50:35,078 --> 03:50:36,859
[SPEAKER_27]: These were schoolchildren telling us to go.

1544
03:50:38,075 --> 03:50:40,680
[SPEAKER_27]: yeah, and ourselves and the police and worse.

1545
03:50:40,880 --> 03:50:45,908
[SPEAKER_27]: I got hit off the head with a sign by a teenager who teaches these kids this.

1546
03:50:46,730 --> 03:50:49,655
[SPEAKER_27]: Common sense has left the city and needs to be brought back.

1547
03:50:50,222 --> 03:50:55,086
[SPEAKER_27]: If we don't teach our true history as it was, the kids will go back thinking D-Day is a rapper.

1548
03:50:55,406 --> 03:50:59,189
[SPEAKER_27]: Stop destroying the city's monuments and institutions by bringing a divide.

1549
03:50:59,630 --> 03:51:03,893
[SPEAKER_27]: Rather instead, take a step back and start trying to love one another and want better for our children.

1550
03:51:04,433 --> 03:51:13,160
[SPEAKER_27]: And stop this absolute nonsense and pay attention to what the kids are being taught and worry about their future as opposed to the name of the building of where they get their education.

1551
03:51:13,541 --> 03:51:18,925
[SPEAKER_27]: Sign me more than mad in Medford that it's come to this juncture, Betsy Lister.

1552
03:51:21,024 --> 03:51:23,005
[SPEAKER_27]: OK, so that's the first letter.

1553
03:51:23,425 --> 03:51:25,325
[SPEAKER_27]: Yep, two more.

1554
03:51:26,405 --> 03:51:34,647
[SPEAKER_27]: The second letter on this topic comes from Medford United and Eunice Brown.

1555
03:51:36,148 --> 03:51:40,909
[SPEAKER_27]: And she's transmitted to us a packet of information

1556
03:51:42,341 --> 03:51:53,526
[SPEAKER_27]: So it says, dear May Lungo current school committee members and superintendent Edouard-Vincent, as concerned citizens of Medford, Massachusetts, we submit the documentation to support our position.

1557
03:51:53,946 --> 03:51:56,527
[SPEAKER_27]: The name of the Columbus school should remain unchanged.

1558
03:51:56,987 --> 03:52:01,969
[SPEAKER_27]: We strongly believe in the proposed name, believe the proposed name change is unnecessary.

1559
03:52:02,630 --> 03:52:10,813
[SPEAKER_27]: This packet includes several components, this cover letter, a hard copy of the petition description that was circulated,

1560
03:52:11,684 --> 03:52:17,749
[SPEAKER_27]: online and hard copy petitions that have been signed by current and former Medford residents who oppose the name change.

1561
03:52:18,329 --> 03:52:20,030
[SPEAKER_27]: Total signatures 2,100.

1562
03:52:20,471 --> 03:52:23,833
[SPEAKER_27]: Medford residents signatures 650 plus.

1563
03:52:25,574 --> 03:52:34,761
[SPEAKER_27]: Differential in signatures, individuals who may not currently resign in Medford, but who have grown up in the city and who continue to have family ties or business interests in Medford.

1564
03:52:36,553 --> 03:52:41,317
[SPEAKER_27]: Regarding the handwritten sheets of petitions collected, in some case, the signer signed for him or herself.

1565
03:52:41,397 --> 03:52:44,099
[SPEAKER_27]: In other cases, written permission was received to sign for them.

1566
03:52:45,200 --> 03:52:49,504
[SPEAKER_27]: That is why you will see signatures with the same handwriting.

1567
03:52:49,664 --> 03:52:53,947
[SPEAKER_27]: One petition site that we use required that we email the URL to the results to you.

1568
03:52:54,008 --> 03:53:02,735
[SPEAKER_27]: That is the GO petition site, and that was the most recent petition circled and has thus far netted us 21 names, 15 of which are Medford residents.

1569
03:53:03,800 --> 03:53:06,961
[SPEAKER_27]: Those results will be sent email to the official school committee email.

1570
03:53:08,041 --> 03:53:13,943
[SPEAKER_27]: Information regarding Christopher Columbus is point number four.

1571
03:53:13,963 --> 03:53:16,703
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that must be in the packet.

1572
03:53:16,843 --> 03:53:19,964
[SPEAKER_27]: Number five, information regarding the Italian-American alliance.

1573
03:53:20,664 --> 03:53:24,565
[SPEAKER_27]: We believe that it is a strong sampling of the true sentiments of the Medford community.

1574
03:53:25,105 --> 03:53:26,546
[SPEAKER_27]: We want our voices to be heard.

1575
03:53:26,566 --> 03:53:30,807
[SPEAKER_27]: It is disturbing that such a monumental decision that changes the fabric of our city

1576
03:53:31,297 --> 03:53:34,780
[SPEAKER_27]: was decided with a sheer lack of transparency and community input.

1577
03:53:35,341 --> 03:53:42,467
[SPEAKER_27]: A decision of this magnitude should have been advertised far and wide across all media platforms and far in advance of a meeting.

1578
03:53:42,887 --> 03:53:43,588
[SPEAKER_27]: It should not have been

1579
03:53:44,398 --> 03:53:46,960
[SPEAKER_27]: advertised only to meet the letter of the law.

1580
03:53:47,381 --> 03:53:48,481
[SPEAKER_27]: This is unconscionable.

1581
03:53:48,982 --> 03:54:06,556
[SPEAKER_27]: We are deeply disappointed that any steps taken to move forward on this matter are considered ethnically biased, disrespectful, and thoughtless, insulting multiple generations of Italian-Americans who grew up, lived in, attended, and supported and contributed to the Columbus School as well as the city of Medford.

1582
03:54:07,008 --> 03:54:12,140
[SPEAKER_27]: For Italian Americans, this school name has and will always be a source of pride and history.

1583
03:54:12,581 --> 03:54:15,026
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a passionate and personal issue for many on.

1584
03:54:16,039 --> 03:54:27,564
[SPEAKER_27]: on both sides and with other urgent matters much higher on the priority list that our city is facing, we are putting forth our best efforts to stop the Medford School Committee from changing the name of the Columbus School.

1585
03:54:28,364 --> 03:54:36,067
[SPEAKER_27]: On Friday, March 5th, Educational Commissioner Riley ordered all elementary school students must return to in-person learning effective April 5th.

1586
03:54:36,147 --> 03:54:39,309
[SPEAKER_27]: This should be the school committee's only priority at this time.

1587
03:54:39,809 --> 03:54:41,529
[SPEAKER_27]: To quote a school committee member and their,

1588
03:54:43,345 --> 03:54:52,129
[SPEAKER_27]: And there is a budget, quite possibly the most contentious budget ever, that we will be attempting to craft at the same time as replanning this year and planning next year.

1589
03:54:53,909 --> 03:55:00,392
[SPEAKER_27]: It would be a gross abdication of responsibility to the children of Medford to spend time right now on the renaming of a school

1590
03:55:00,834 --> 03:55:04,957
[SPEAKER_27]: when issues directly related to the well-being of our children are smack in front of them.

1591
03:55:05,538 --> 03:55:15,386
[SPEAKER_27]: We request that our discussion regarding changing the name of the Columbus School be tabled at this time until our children have returned to school safely for the remainder of the academic year.

1592
03:55:15,846 --> 03:55:22,652
[SPEAKER_27]: Budget issues are managed and there is a plan in place to return our children to the academic year 21-22.

1593
03:55:22,732 --> 03:55:26,495
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for your consideration, sincerely concerned citizens of Medford.

1594
03:55:28,356 --> 03:55:29,337
[SPEAKER_27]: And then I have one more.

1595
03:55:32,758 --> 03:55:33,439
[SPEAKER_27]: on this subject.

1596
03:55:33,559 --> 03:55:38,203
[SPEAKER_27]: This was submitted by Brenna Christensen.

1597
03:55:39,104 --> 03:55:51,616
[SPEAKER_27]: Dear Mayor Lungo-Koehn and members of the Medford School Committee, my name is Brenna Christensen and I am a graduate of the class of 2020 from Medford High School and a former captain of the varsity softball team.

1598
03:55:52,336 --> 03:55:57,281
[SPEAKER_27]: I write to you today to request a name change to Columbus Memorial Park

1599
03:55:57,793 --> 03:56:04,136
[SPEAKER_27]: the Crystal Campbell Field and to incorporate the name changing of the field to the future name change committee.

1600
03:56:05,837 --> 03:56:11,619
[SPEAKER_27]: So she's recommending that we change the name of the Columbus School to the Crystal Campbell School.

1601
03:56:12,519 --> 03:56:16,741
[SPEAKER_27]: Crystal Campbell was a Medford native, a victim of the Boston Marathon bombings.

1602
03:56:17,282 --> 03:56:21,924
[SPEAKER_27]: She was an active member in our Mustang community and was in the band along with the softball team.

1603
03:56:22,484 --> 03:56:27,226
[SPEAKER_27]: Crystal Campbell was known to light up any room she walked into and she loved sunflowers.

1604
03:56:27,972 --> 03:56:31,913
[SPEAKER_27]: She is an inspiration to our city, our home, our residents, and our athletes.

1605
03:56:32,853 --> 03:56:40,755
[SPEAKER_27]: Since 2013, the varsity softball team has held the Crystal Campbell Softball Tournament in mid-April at the Columbus Park Softball Field.

1606
03:56:41,455 --> 03:56:47,336
[SPEAKER_27]: During the two-day tournament, us Mustangs competed against Boricua, Swampscott, and Arlington Catholic High School.

1607
03:56:47,817 --> 03:56:53,978
[SPEAKER_27]: We actively fundraised during the tournament and throughout our season to donate to the Crystal Campbell Scholarship Fund.

1608
03:56:55,046 --> 03:56:59,251
[SPEAKER_27]: On this day, our community comes together as one and united.

1609
03:56:59,672 --> 03:57:01,133
[SPEAKER_27]: We are truly Medford strong.

1610
03:57:01,634 --> 03:57:08,062
[SPEAKER_27]: Although this tournament may only be two days out of the year, during our entire season, we wear her name on our jersey.

1611
03:57:08,622 --> 03:57:10,384
[SPEAKER_27]: And we wear it with immense pride.

1612
03:57:10,525 --> 03:57:14,209
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a day when we give back to the community and honor Crystal's legacy.

1613
03:57:15,089 --> 03:57:23,075
[SPEAKER_27]: Not only is the Columbus Park field home to our high school Mustang softball team, we share this field with our youth softball program and baseball as well.

1614
03:57:23,675 --> 03:57:28,339
[SPEAKER_27]: We meet our forever friends, learn sportsmanship along with the importance of responsibility.

1615
03:57:28,699 --> 03:57:31,481
[SPEAKER_27]: But for all of that, we make memories that will last a lifetime.

1616
03:57:31,901 --> 03:57:35,664
[SPEAKER_27]: Each and every play on that field, we keep crystal close to our hearts and play in our honor.

1617
03:57:36,485 --> 03:57:40,908
[SPEAKER_27]: I respectfully ask that we use our Medford strength, come together as one and rename our fields.

1618
03:57:41,618 --> 03:57:50,163
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's continue the pride we feel when we wear Campbell on our jerseys and with a positive change to our city, the city we all love and with gratitude get to call home.

1619
03:57:50,304 --> 03:57:50,624
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1620
03:57:50,684 --> 03:57:54,526
[SPEAKER_27]: Kind regards, Brenda Christensen, 80 Fern Road.

1621
03:57:55,307 --> 03:58:06,014
[SPEAKER_27]: So excuse me, she may be asking just for the fields to carry the name and we would do that under a separate consideration, but we might forward her email to the advisory council anyway.

1622
03:58:08,075 --> 03:58:08,295
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1623
03:58:08,315 --> 03:58:09,076
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate it.

1624
03:58:12,152 --> 03:58:16,105
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have two resolutions, one by member Rousseau and by member.

1625
03:58:17,967 --> 03:58:24,929
[SPEAKER_24]: Van der Kloot, both of which are going to be moved to Committee of the Whole for a further discussion on Wednesday.

1626
03:58:25,409 --> 03:58:26,469
[SPEAKER_24]: That meeting starts at 5.45 PM.

1627
03:58:26,609 --> 03:58:29,710
[SPEAKER_24]: Mayor Van der Kloot.

1628
03:58:30,090 --> 03:58:33,912
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, can I just, there's a curriculum subcommittee meeting from 4 to 5.30.

1629
03:58:34,092 --> 03:58:42,714
[SPEAKER_27]: I think originally people thought this meeting, our Committee of the Whole was going to be at 5.30, so just to repeat, it starts at 5.45.

1630
03:58:42,814 --> 03:58:43,094
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.

1631
03:58:46,755 --> 03:58:52,399
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, 545 on Wednesday, March 10th, to discuss the two resolutions.

1632
03:58:52,640 --> 03:58:53,460
[SPEAKER_24]: Member McLaughlin.

1633
03:58:54,461 --> 03:59:04,469
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor, I also just wanted to mention that I had a previous commitment to talk on a panel for the Special Education Parent Advisory Council that meets the second Wednesday of every month.

1634
03:59:05,169 --> 03:59:13,836
[SPEAKER_20]: So I have to excuse myself from the meeting for one hour, six to seven, but I will be there from 545 to six, and then I will return at seven o'clock.

1635
03:59:13,916 --> 03:59:16,458
[SPEAKER_20]: So my apologies, please excuse me,

1636
03:59:17,150 --> 03:59:19,952
[SPEAKER_20]: It had been a long time commitment that I need to keep.

1637
03:59:20,012 --> 03:59:20,352
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1638
03:59:21,032 --> 03:59:21,412
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1639
03:59:23,934 --> 03:59:24,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Eunice.

1640
03:59:26,976 --> 03:59:27,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1641
03:59:27,616 --> 03:59:29,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Madam Mayor.

1642
03:59:30,858 --> 03:59:34,780
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just have a question about the meeting on Wednesday night.

1643
03:59:35,961 --> 03:59:43,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me, either yourself through the chair or to the superintendent or whomever is the appropriate person,

1644
03:59:45,915 --> 03:59:59,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me what the first date it was that you publicized the meeting this coming Wednesday night and across what platforms it was published.

1645
04:00:05,180 --> 04:00:06,120
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't hear you.

1646
04:00:07,360 --> 04:00:08,441
[SPEAKER_24]: Dr. Edward-Vincent, do we have Ms.

1647
04:00:08,461 --> 04:00:09,241
[SPEAKER_24]: Wise on the call?

1648
04:00:10,393 --> 04:00:12,455
[SPEAKER_24]: I can look back and see when it was posted.

1649
04:00:12,995 --> 04:00:19,160
[SPEAKER_28]: We announced the committee of the whole at one of the previous school committee meetings back.

1650
04:00:20,341 --> 04:00:22,022
[SPEAKER_28]: It was announced that it would be March 10.

1651
04:00:25,424 --> 04:00:26,984
[SPEAKER_28]: that that committee of the whole would be.

1652
04:00:27,065 --> 04:00:28,785
[SPEAKER_28]: So I want to say it was a February meeting.

1653
04:00:31,566 --> 04:00:35,327
[SPEAKER_28]: And then at that time we said it would be a 5.30 p.m.

1654
04:00:35,407 --> 04:00:36,127
[SPEAKER_28]: start meeting.

1655
04:00:37,668 --> 04:00:40,949
[SPEAKER_28]: We also put it in our Friday communication.

1656
04:00:43,279 --> 04:00:49,905
[SPEAKER_28]: that went out on Friday, that we have the Committee of the Whole meeting scheduled for next week.

1657
04:00:50,966 --> 04:01:00,496
[SPEAKER_28]: And following the 48 hours, it was posted today, it was posted for Wednesday's meeting for the clerk's office.

1658
04:01:01,986 --> 04:01:02,426
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1659
04:01:02,867 --> 04:01:06,609
[SPEAKER_28]: It is officially posted and that's following the open meeting law.

1660
04:01:07,169 --> 04:01:10,511
[SPEAKER_28]: It was posted for the school on the school side.

1661
04:01:10,551 --> 04:01:28,161
[SPEAKER_28]: It went out in our Friday communication and it was announced at our February 22nd meeting that the committee of the whole would be on Wednesday, March 10th.

1662
04:01:31,016 --> 04:01:31,416
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1663
04:01:31,436 --> 04:01:48,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I distinctly remember you saying, and it's on video, of course, that the meeting would be publicized early and across multiple media platforms.

1664
04:01:49,091 --> 04:01:50,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I took that to mean that

1665
04:01:52,463 --> 04:01:57,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Early, not the Friday before, or I did see it posted this afternoon.

1666
04:01:58,207 --> 04:02:00,108
[SPEAKER_04]: So you met the letter of the law, of course.

1667
04:02:01,669 --> 04:02:16,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Early to me means a couple of weeks before, across multiple media platforms, plastered all over social media, perhaps on Medford Patch, on the local transcript.

1668
04:02:16,357 --> 04:02:18,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked up a transcript last Thursday.

1669
04:02:18,259 --> 04:02:20,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see anything there.

1670
04:02:21,539 --> 04:02:25,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Much of the community is not on social media, so they wouldn't have known about this.

1671
04:02:26,342 --> 04:02:44,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it completely disingenuous that you basically publicized it on your usual platforms, Medford Public Schools, which for some people who don't have children don't necessarily look there, but have a vested interest in this particular issue.

1672
04:02:44,915 --> 04:02:44,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

1673
04:02:47,907 --> 04:03:05,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have assumed and would have hoped that you would have publicized this far and wide through our newspaper outlets, across a number of different social media sites and so forth.

1674
04:03:07,375 --> 04:03:08,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So I find that

1675
04:03:10,535 --> 04:03:20,860
[SPEAKER_04]: at best, lazy, negligent, and neglectful, and at worst, a bit of a lie.

1676
04:03:21,861 --> 04:03:23,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second thing that I'll ask.

1677
04:03:23,681 --> 04:03:25,222
[SPEAKER_28]: I do take offense.

1678
04:03:25,282 --> 04:03:26,883
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't consider myself a liar.

1679
04:03:27,683 --> 04:03:28,744
[SPEAKER_28]: And I published it.

1680
04:03:29,977 --> 04:03:31,058
[SPEAKER_28]: to the letter of the law.

1681
04:03:31,458 --> 04:03:32,398
[SPEAKER_28]: Open meeting law.

1682
04:03:32,579 --> 04:03:34,520
[SPEAKER_28]: I published it in my communication.

1683
04:03:35,040 --> 04:03:38,142
[SPEAKER_28]: We have our school committee meetings posted on the website.

1684
04:03:38,702 --> 04:03:40,463
[SPEAKER_28]: So please do not call me a liar.

1685
04:03:41,183 --> 04:03:42,504
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not going to take that lightly.

1686
04:03:42,584 --> 04:03:44,846
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not lying to you or anyone in the community.

1687
04:03:45,446 --> 04:03:53,831
[SPEAKER_28]: We are having a committee of the whole so that people will be allowed to speak at regarding the Columbus school renaming.

1688
04:03:53,871 --> 04:03:55,612
[SPEAKER_28]: This was something that was asked

1689
04:03:56,624 --> 04:04:04,921
[SPEAKER_28]: approved last school year, and this is an opportunity for anyone from the community to be able to speak.

1690
04:04:07,389 --> 04:04:12,312
[SPEAKER_04]: you wouldn't think that there are plenty of people in this community.

1691
04:04:12,792 --> 04:04:29,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that from the 2,100 signatures we got, 650 of them from Medford alone, that there are an awful lot of people that don't necessarily follow the Medford Public Schools website, but this topic is of great interest to basically the entire city.

1692
04:04:30,694 --> 04:04:42,135
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second thing that I'll ask is that at that same meeting back in February, member Kreatz requested that there be participation from

1693
04:04:42,937 --> 04:04:57,126
[SPEAKER_04]: the NAACP director, the diversity director, the Italian-American community, the South Medford community, and you also said yourself that anyone who had emailed regarding the topic would also be notified of the meeting.

1694
04:04:57,146 --> 04:05:00,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering, was any of that done?

1695
04:05:00,208 --> 04:05:03,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Were those invitations to those individuals that Ms.

1696
04:05:03,570 --> 04:05:06,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Kreatz wanted extended to those people?

1697
04:05:07,836 --> 04:05:16,001
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a list of some of the restaurants for South Medford businesses.

1698
04:05:16,561 --> 04:05:25,627
[SPEAKER_28]: In addition to that, we have been in contact with Neil Osborne, the director of diversity.

1699
04:05:26,407 --> 04:05:31,710
[SPEAKER_28]: And he was working collaboratively with Lisa Evangelista to get

1700
04:05:33,451 --> 04:05:38,212
[SPEAKER_28]: additional communications out to specific groups that were listed.

1701
04:05:39,392 --> 04:05:44,834
[SPEAKER_28]: It was posted on the blog, the website, Twitter, and Facebook.

1702
04:05:45,594 --> 04:05:47,534
[SPEAKER_28]: Lisa Evangelista sent me that.

1703
04:05:49,095 --> 04:05:51,895
[SPEAKER_28]: She said the local press does choose to print.

1704
04:05:53,436 --> 04:06:00,398
[SPEAKER_28]: When we send communications out, it is sent to them, but we're not able to dictate what it is that they choose to print.

1705
04:06:03,055 --> 04:06:08,096
[SPEAKER_04]: So was a communication about this meeting sent to the transcript and the patch?

1706
04:06:09,376 --> 04:06:13,437
[SPEAKER_28]: I will wait for her to send me a response because she just sent me that right now.

1707
04:06:13,577 --> 04:06:17,418
[SPEAKER_28]: But she said she does forward her communications to them.

1708
04:06:17,478 --> 04:06:20,679
[SPEAKER_28]: So I will wait to receive an update regarding that.

1709
04:06:21,359 --> 04:06:21,759
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1710
04:06:22,519 --> 04:06:25,160
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'd appreciate it if you would get back to me on that.

1711
04:06:25,640 --> 04:06:26,660
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor has my email.

1712
04:06:26,680 --> 04:06:29,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1713
04:06:29,660 --> 04:06:30,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Curious about that.

1714
04:06:30,421 --> 04:06:32,301
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to we have

1715
04:06:33,689 --> 04:06:36,693
[SPEAKER_24]: Anne-Marie, if you could limit your comments.

1716
04:06:36,713 --> 04:06:43,503
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure how many people want to speak, but we have 125 people on, so we're going to limit to about two minutes each like we've done in the past.

1717
04:06:43,844 --> 04:06:45,847
[SPEAKER_24]: But please, let me unmute you.

1718
04:06:50,720 --> 04:06:52,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, am I all set?

1719
04:06:52,701 --> 04:06:53,041
[SPEAKER_24]: All set.

1720
04:06:53,061 --> 04:06:54,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1721
04:06:55,342 --> 04:07:01,465
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I've been listening to the meeting tonight, and I know you said give me two minutes, but I'm gonna try my best.

1722
04:07:02,465 --> 04:07:04,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been listening to the meeting tonight.

1723
04:07:05,727 --> 04:07:09,949
[SPEAKER_06]: As some of you might know or not know, I am a former school committee member.

1724
04:07:10,949 --> 04:07:15,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And I try to listen with fair ears and to listen to all sides.

1725
04:07:17,533 --> 04:07:31,341
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like listening to all the subcommittee meetings that you've had, and with the mandate of, let's say, the commissioner, there's a lot on everyone's plate.

1726
04:07:32,502 --> 04:07:39,746
[SPEAKER_06]: And there has to be a president's, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't get this out.

1727
04:07:40,856 --> 04:07:59,930
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about process, we're talking about priorities and looking at what you have on your plate, you have budgets coming, you have the, you know, you have parents that really don't know if they want to select hybrid if they do want to select hybrid if they want to have their students in school, there's a lot of questions.

1728
04:08:00,831 --> 04:08:14,275
[SPEAKER_06]: With all due respect, you guys have spent a lot of time on this, but I can guarantee you there's going to be a lot more phone calls from a lot of people right now, asking about the differences between, you know, what they choose what they don't choose.

1729
04:08:15,695 --> 04:08:18,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, from what I've been hearing.

1730
04:08:19,176 --> 04:08:23,120
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the fact of, do you want to name change of the Columbus?

1731
04:08:23,420 --> 04:08:25,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you want the name change of the Columbus?

1732
04:08:25,542 --> 04:08:36,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess what I'm respectfully asking is asking the school committee and you, the mayor, as the chair, to really consider putting the priority of putting our children back into school.

1733
04:08:36,732 --> 04:08:39,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've been working diligently on trying to do that.

1734
04:08:40,255 --> 04:08:44,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you have the commissioner of the state of Massachusetts, who is going to start

1735
04:08:45,506 --> 04:08:54,353
[SPEAKER_06]: putting mandates and putting his own spin on certain things, even though it might not seem fair, it's going to have to happen.

1736
04:08:54,773 --> 04:09:09,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And listening to the results of the decrease of the positive COVID tests, I mean, listening to a lot of the people that have already called and made decisions to the school system,

1737
04:09:10,505 --> 04:09:16,696
[SPEAKER_06]: to let them know if their children are going hybrid and stuff, you do have a lot of positives going down.

1738
04:09:17,157 --> 04:09:22,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So when the commissioner looks at something like that, he's going to know that here's a city

1739
04:09:23,905 --> 04:09:38,515
[SPEAKER_06]: who is going to be positive, and he's going to be putting more pressure on that because the numbers that decrease in COVID are huge as far as the lesser we have, the better opportunity to get back into the school.

1740
04:09:38,975 --> 04:09:40,276
[SPEAKER_06]: They are going to look at that.

1741
04:09:40,817 --> 04:09:43,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I know there's a lot of

1742
04:09:44,099 --> 04:09:49,421
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, high passionate people out there for or against this situation.

1743
04:09:50,001 --> 04:10:00,526
[SPEAKER_06]: But honestly, at this point, I really just ask the school committee to please put your priorities intact as far as this just came up the pipe.

1744
04:10:00,906 --> 04:10:02,146
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to look at that.

1745
04:10:05,308 --> 04:10:06,128
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Anne-Marie.

1746
04:10:10,650 --> 04:10:12,951
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion on the floor

1747
04:10:13,823 --> 04:10:14,664
[SPEAKER_24]: Member van de Kloot?

1748
04:10:15,584 --> 04:10:31,653
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, so the one thing I just want to say is that the resolution that I'm sending to the Committee of the Whole talks about timeline as does Member Ruseau's.

1749
04:10:33,494 --> 04:10:37,857
[SPEAKER_27]: This is quite separate from and different from discussing the key issue.

1750
04:10:38,237 --> 04:10:41,139
[SPEAKER_27]: We've already made a decision that the school would be renamed.

1751
04:10:41,579 --> 04:10:42,940
[SPEAKER_27]: I understand that there are very

1752
04:10:44,502 --> 04:10:52,369
[SPEAKER_27]: feelings about this and I certainly understand that there are people who are very angry about the process that was used right at the beginning.

1753
04:10:53,950 --> 04:11:10,824
[SPEAKER_27]: In terms of the timing and us concentrating on what we need to, it was my intent after spending a great deal of time working out the potential for the advisory council to discuss the timeline

1754
04:11:11,583 --> 04:11:13,125
[SPEAKER_27]: with the committee at that point.

1755
04:11:13,445 --> 04:11:20,430
[SPEAKER_27]: To do so tonight without having reviewed the resolutions just simply won't make any sense.

1756
04:11:20,490 --> 04:11:21,311
[SPEAKER_27]: It'll be random.

1757
04:11:21,431 --> 04:11:34,021
[SPEAKER_27]: So while I appreciate hearing from my former colleague, the intent was to send the resolution to the subcommittee to discuss timelines and processes.

1758
04:11:37,263 --> 04:11:37,604
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1759
04:11:39,889 --> 04:11:42,410
[SPEAKER_24]: and then we have another resident that would like to speak.

1760
04:11:43,331 --> 04:11:44,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, ma'am.

1761
04:11:44,412 --> 04:11:52,677
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to, I sent this out to the committee a week ago, which is not the normal procedure, but I wanted everybody to have a chance to actually look it over.

1762
04:11:52,697 --> 04:12:07,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I also did wanna say that this resolution that I wrote was an attempt to give us something to work from or to react to, rather than getting us together with a blank piece of paper and trying to draft a frankly technical document

1763
04:12:08,839 --> 04:12:09,899
[SPEAKER_14]: from thin air.

1764
04:12:10,920 --> 04:12:22,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of the elements of this are not things that I feel strongly about and are in fact meant to get us to deliberate and to get to a place where we're comfortable with a final product.

1765
04:12:22,683 --> 04:12:28,585
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate Member van der Kloet's alternate version, which takes a different approach to many of the elements.

1766
04:12:29,165 --> 04:12:32,446
[SPEAKER_14]: And I look forward to the conversations around how to bring them together.

1767
04:12:32,506 --> 04:12:36,868
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess this is what conference committees are like between the Senate and the House.

1768
04:12:36,988 --> 04:12:37,448
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to

1769
04:12:38,035 --> 04:12:40,776
[SPEAKER_11]: work these two together in one resolution.

1770
04:12:40,876 --> 04:12:50,099
[SPEAKER_14]: And obviously all the members will have all the opportunity to tear them both apart or whatever, so we can get to something we like.

1771
04:12:50,219 --> 04:12:56,781
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank you all for your effort to your work to be through it.

1772
04:12:56,921 --> 04:12:59,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it was like three or four pages long.

1773
04:12:59,422 --> 04:13:05,964
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and my hearing apparently Paulette is making the sound that my audio is crappy again, my apologies.

1774
04:13:06,465 --> 04:13:06,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1775
04:13:09,244 --> 04:13:10,045
[SPEAKER_22]: David McKillop.

1776
04:13:13,448 --> 04:13:14,309
[SPEAKER_34]: Good evening, everybody.

1777
04:13:14,649 --> 04:13:16,911
[SPEAKER_34]: It's nice to see some faces in this crazy time.

1778
04:13:18,052 --> 04:13:23,497
[SPEAKER_34]: This is certainly a challenge for you guys and I honestly don't have any words of comfort.

1779
04:13:24,058 --> 04:13:26,240
[SPEAKER_34]: My question is in listening to you.

1780
04:13:27,281 --> 04:13:29,743
[SPEAKER_34]: Actually, it's more of an assumption at this point that

1781
04:13:30,629 --> 04:13:43,492
[SPEAKER_34]: even though everyone here is looking to have their voices heard, am I clear in hearing that the decision has already been made and you're just at the point of procedure, from what I'm hearing from Ms.

1782
04:13:44,913 --> 04:13:53,075
[SPEAKER_34]: Van der Kloot and Mr. Rousseau, that sounds to me like it's more about procedure now that the decision has already been made.

1783
04:13:53,135 --> 04:13:54,495
[SPEAKER_34]: Is that correct or incorrect?

1784
04:13:56,015 --> 04:13:57,876
[SPEAKER_24]: That's correct, Mr. McKillop.

1785
04:13:59,587 --> 04:14:06,711
[SPEAKER_34]: So the unfortunate part is there are a tremendous amount of people that feel like their voices have not been heard.

1786
04:14:07,631 --> 04:14:16,916
[SPEAKER_34]: And my question to you as a committee, is there an opportunity to pull this back and really give the community a chance to absorb this conversation?

1787
04:14:25,921 --> 04:14:27,362
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be up to the committee.

1788
04:14:29,463 --> 04:14:34,386
[SPEAKER_24]: In June, there was a motion to table this to allow for more comment and that motion had failed.

1789
04:14:35,467 --> 04:14:49,076
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we moved on, obviously trying to get our kids back through the pandemic and trying to outline a process now, a fair process that will end sometime probably in June.

1790
04:14:50,557 --> 04:14:54,760
[SPEAKER_34]: So I would just like to speak to that for a second, Mayor, if I could.

1791
04:14:56,001 --> 04:14:57,442
[SPEAKER_34]: I think, you know,

1792
04:14:58,401 --> 04:15:04,398
[SPEAKER_34]: being able to process this as a community and understand

1793
04:15:05,222 --> 04:15:12,264
[SPEAKER_34]: you know, in its totality, why the decision was made, how we came to the decision, was it a jump decision?

1794
04:15:12,364 --> 04:15:15,245
[SPEAKER_34]: Was it following an agenda that's national?

1795
04:15:15,705 --> 04:15:17,025
[SPEAKER_34]: What was the real purpose?

1796
04:15:17,626 --> 04:15:24,688
[SPEAKER_34]: And can we take a step back to take a step forward so everyone can get behind whatever the decision may be?

1797
04:15:24,708 --> 04:15:31,490
[SPEAKER_34]: I employ the committee to really think about that because this is a community of 60,000 people.

1798
04:15:33,130 --> 04:15:39,213
[SPEAKER_34]: and not a small community of very vocal, very active.

1799
04:15:39,653 --> 04:15:50,357
[SPEAKER_34]: There are a lot of people that work in this community morning, noon, and night that aren't really as exposed to some of the things that we're exposed to in today's world.

1800
04:15:51,257 --> 04:15:53,738
[SPEAKER_34]: that would like the opportunity to be able to discuss this.

1801
04:15:54,038 --> 04:16:04,739
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'm just asking you to really kind of look at this in the situation that we're in, the fact that we've been in this COVID situation for a year now and we're all in COVID fatigue.

1802
04:16:05,279 --> 04:16:07,140
[SPEAKER_34]: We all agree there.

1803
04:16:07,760 --> 04:16:16,861
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think putting this out there just really kind of drives a stake into the community without giving them the opportunity to speak.

1804
04:16:17,482 --> 04:16:20,062
[SPEAKER_34]: That's really all I wanted to speak to.

1805
04:16:21,920 --> 04:16:22,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1806
04:16:23,702 --> 04:16:24,142
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1807
04:16:30,087 --> 04:16:30,448
[SPEAKER_22]: Kelly.

1808
04:16:34,892 --> 04:16:36,453
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

1809
04:16:36,753 --> 04:16:38,435
[SPEAKER_32]: I just can you hear me.

1810
04:16:39,059 --> 04:16:39,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1811
04:16:39,619 --> 04:16:39,860
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

1812
04:16:40,200 --> 04:16:53,568
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to echo and follow up with Dave just said, because this entire thing about renaming the schools reminds me when the city was going to sell the old schools and they were going to build the new ones.

1813
04:16:54,308 --> 04:17:02,514
[SPEAKER_32]: And, you know, if anybody didn't live in the city at that time, this was done in a very careful manner.

1814
04:17:02,574 --> 04:17:04,715
[SPEAKER_32]: In fact, Madam Mayor, you were on that committee.

1815
04:17:05,202 --> 04:17:10,988
[SPEAKER_32]: that went from neighborhood to neighborhood, and the neighbors were allowed to have a voice.

1816
04:17:11,728 --> 04:17:15,852
[SPEAKER_32]: And this isn't about whether or not the school gets renamed in the end.

1817
04:17:16,453 --> 04:17:21,418
[SPEAKER_32]: It's about allowing the community to go through the process

1818
04:17:21,838 --> 04:17:25,199
[SPEAKER_32]: so that they all still feel like they are part of the community.

1819
04:17:25,779 --> 04:17:33,622
[SPEAKER_32]: This renaming of a school and the way that this was handled was not very professional and it's ripped people in part.

1820
04:17:34,082 --> 04:17:41,245
[SPEAKER_32]: Neighbors who used to like each other are fighting over the name of a school and it's a really sad day in Medford.

1821
04:17:41,625 --> 04:17:48,693
[SPEAKER_32]: You do have the opportunity to just step back a moment and let the community be heard.

1822
04:17:48,853 --> 04:17:50,495
[SPEAKER_32]: Let their voice be heard.

1823
04:17:50,895 --> 04:17:55,781
[SPEAKER_32]: When they elected you, they trusted that you were going to let their voices be heard.

1824
04:17:55,801 --> 04:18:00,326
[SPEAKER_32]: And I almost feel like as somebody who watched that meeting go on in June,

1825
04:18:00,966 --> 04:18:06,671
[SPEAKER_32]: I felt like a couple of people really didn't care what 60,000 people thought.

1826
04:18:07,111 --> 04:18:11,435
[SPEAKER_32]: Nobody cared that people felt like they got to go through the process.

1827
04:18:11,835 --> 04:18:26,267
[SPEAKER_32]: And when you think about your daily life, when you get up in the morning and you get your kids breakfast and you get them to school, you follow a process because it allows you as a human to be able to get through life in a very comfortable way.

1828
04:18:26,607 --> 04:18:28,169
[SPEAKER_32]: What if you didn't have that process?

1829
04:18:28,209 --> 04:18:29,029
[SPEAKER_32]: How would that feel?

1830
04:18:29,750 --> 04:18:34,473
[SPEAKER_32]: This isn't, I don't feel like this is something that can't be stepped back.

1831
04:18:34,533 --> 04:18:37,254
[SPEAKER_32]: There's no urgency to push it forward.

1832
04:18:37,774 --> 04:18:39,375
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd really like to echo it.

1833
04:18:39,435 --> 04:18:44,838
[SPEAKER_32]: And I really like you to just allow the people to be heard, just to let them speak on it.

1834
04:18:45,418 --> 04:18:45,798
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1835
04:18:48,080 --> 04:18:48,680
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Kelly.

1836
04:18:59,065 --> 04:19:00,907
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion on the floor either way?

1837
04:19:00,927 --> 04:19:06,833
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Kreatz?

1838
04:19:12,728 --> 04:19:13,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I was just trying to unmute.

1839
04:19:14,789 --> 04:19:35,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so, you know, I would like to ask my colleagues, you know, if they would consider, respectfully consider, you know, in advance of the meeting, reviewing the timeline that has been put forth in both resolutions and consider expanding the dates

1840
04:19:36,135 --> 04:19:39,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I just went back and I read the original resolution.

1841
04:19:40,241 --> 04:19:53,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So the, the, the original resolution states, be it resolved that the Christopher Columbus elementary school be renamed effective July one 2021 in advisory committee shall be created.

1842
04:19:54,179 --> 04:19:55,940
[SPEAKER_05]: with a term of six months.

1843
04:19:56,320 --> 04:20:08,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So the advisory committee was supposed to have six months beginning no later than October 1st and provide a recommendation to the committee no later than February 1st, 2021.

1844
04:20:09,748 --> 04:20:20,034
[SPEAKER_05]: So in that original resolution, it was given ample time to come up with a new name, have that committee formed,

1845
04:20:21,354 --> 04:20:30,731
[SPEAKER_05]: have a new name discussed, thoroughly vetted, and that the school committee would reconvene the Committee of the Whole before September 1st.

1846
04:20:30,811 --> 04:20:32,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm just pointing out the dates.

1847
04:20:34,049 --> 04:20:36,950
[SPEAKER_05]: all of those dates have already been passed.

1848
04:20:37,430 --> 04:20:43,151
[SPEAKER_05]: We missed all those deadline dates and we missed all those deadline dates because we're in a pandemic.

1849
04:20:44,012 --> 04:20:51,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we've seen in the pandemic, all the dates had to slide for everything we were doing, everywhere.

1850
04:20:51,653 --> 04:20:54,314
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all the dates had to slide.

1851
04:20:54,734 --> 04:21:01,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I am just respectfully asking if my colleagues could think,

1852
04:21:02,196 --> 04:21:12,708
[SPEAKER_05]: In preparation of Wednesday's meeting, you know if we can maybe try to come up with a different timeline, so that there can be a thoughtful respective.

1853
04:21:13,489 --> 04:21:16,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry not respective reflective discussions.

1854
04:21:17,113 --> 04:21:28,462
[SPEAKER_05]: for that advisory committee once they're formed to thoroughly research a new name, have public meetings, listening sessions.

1855
04:21:29,943 --> 04:21:34,126
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I feel like we're rushing this to make that deadline.

1856
04:21:35,223 --> 04:21:37,946
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're still in a pandemic.

1857
04:21:38,646 --> 04:21:52,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just feel that it's such an enormous, you know, task and it just, it requires time, thoughtful time consideration in hearing from all community members.

1858
04:21:55,561 --> 04:21:56,361
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, member Kreatz.

1859
04:21:57,462 --> 04:21:58,143
[SPEAKER_24]: Member van de Kloot.

1860
04:22:03,726 --> 04:22:05,107
[SPEAKER_27]: I referenced this earlier.

1861
04:22:06,428 --> 04:22:24,259
[SPEAKER_27]: I very much in good faith went through the process of looking in detail with thanks to my colleague who I used his as a basis to work through all of the issues that I think the advisory council has.

1862
04:22:24,720 --> 04:22:26,821
[SPEAKER_27]: Who's going to be on the advisory council?

1863
04:22:26,881 --> 04:22:27,822
[SPEAKER_27]: What are they going to do?

1864
04:22:28,302 --> 04:22:29,883
[SPEAKER_27]: How are they going to report it out?

1865
04:22:30,183 --> 04:22:33,165
[SPEAKER_27]: Who's going to pick the names, et cetera?

1866
04:22:33,951 --> 04:22:34,053
[SPEAKER_27]: Um,

1867
04:22:35,672 --> 04:22:52,063
[SPEAKER_27]: My concern is having done that exercise is while in it, I kept the dates except for one week of that Paul had originally put in his, I don't think it's real.

1868
04:22:52,403 --> 04:23:03,650
[SPEAKER_27]: I just don't think there's enough time to have a good reflective process, a thorough process for the advisory council.

1869
04:23:05,959 --> 04:23:12,683
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not saying that we should overturn our decision about Columbus, which I know many in the community would like.

1870
04:23:13,463 --> 04:23:20,067
[SPEAKER_27]: For me, the most important thing is to try and figure a path forward, which brings us unity.

1871
04:23:20,747 --> 04:23:23,629
[SPEAKER_27]: Earlier this evening, we heard those voices of our kids.

1872
04:23:24,669 --> 04:23:30,993
[SPEAKER_27]: And as I was listening to the voices of our kids, I was thinking about this discussion that we were gonna have here.

1873
04:23:31,877 --> 04:23:35,979
[SPEAKER_27]: which has been feeling such division.

1874
04:23:36,779 --> 04:23:40,601
[SPEAKER_27]: And in our kids, we hear the hope and the desire for unity.

1875
04:23:43,062 --> 04:23:49,426
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that the advisory council needs time to do its job well and not rushed.

1876
04:23:50,286 --> 04:23:54,928
[SPEAKER_27]: As I've gotten older, I have more and more of appreciation for that word reflection.

1877
04:23:56,209 --> 04:24:00,551
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, getting a chance to think about what we're doing and what name.

1878
04:24:03,444 --> 04:24:13,433
[SPEAKER_27]: I have put in mind a chance for a public hearing, not to debate the issue of Columbus, but to look at the new names.

1879
04:24:14,173 --> 04:24:24,102
[SPEAKER_27]: All along, I've been hopeful that we could come up with something that would honor our Italian heritage in this community, but also bring the community together.

1880
04:24:25,262 --> 04:24:26,644
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not gonna do that fast.

1881
04:24:26,944 --> 04:24:27,945
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not a slam dunk.

1882
04:24:29,193 --> 04:24:34,676
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that there's much pain with the thought of even prolonging the process a minute longer.

1883
04:24:35,456 --> 04:24:43,801
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that I don't really want it to go through this for month after month, but I am very, very concerned that in our short term, we do have a lot to do.

1884
04:24:47,341 --> 04:24:59,171
[SPEAKER_27]: My feeling is, and again, we can go through, I think going through the process of looking at the process outlined for the advisory council is instructive in terms of saying, whoa, what are you doing?

1885
04:24:59,631 --> 04:25:01,793
[SPEAKER_27]: How are we gonna set this advisory council together?

1886
04:25:01,873 --> 04:25:09,519
[SPEAKER_27]: So that it is really a strong and works to bring the community together.

1887
04:25:10,560 --> 04:25:11,701
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, that's my two cents.

1888
04:25:11,841 --> 04:25:14,303
[SPEAKER_27]: I expected to have this discussion on Wednesday.

1889
04:25:17,466 --> 04:25:18,688
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Member van de Kloet.

1890
04:25:20,189 --> 04:25:20,830
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Kreatz?

1891
04:25:21,631 --> 04:25:32,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I just had one more, because I've been hearing, you know, over the last couple of days, and I did not read it in the original resolution, but I've been hearing that if

1892
04:25:35,569 --> 04:25:55,497
[SPEAKER_05]: The deadline wasn't met by July 1 2021 that the Columbus school would would then be renamed the no name school, but I'm not seeing that in the original resolution so I'm just, you know, I'm just wondering, you know, is that something that I'm.

1893
04:25:56,417 --> 04:26:12,281
[SPEAKER_05]: missing or overlooking if um one of the committee members who wrote that resolution if you could let us know because I have been hearing a lot about that and I just want to you know kind of get an answer on that because I don't know and I didn't know anything about that.

1894
04:26:20,144 --> 04:26:22,724
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah I don't I don't believe that's in any minutes

1895
04:26:25,925 --> 04:26:29,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that just might have been something that got kind of overheard somewhere.

1896
04:26:29,766 --> 04:26:30,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Somewhere, yeah.

1897
04:26:30,986 --> 04:26:32,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, all right, I just wanted to confirm that.

1898
04:26:33,866 --> 04:26:50,950
[SPEAKER_24]: And I agree with Member Kreatz and Member Van der Kloot with regards to, and whether we discuss it now or on Wednesday, the potential of expanding that timeline due to the fact that we have a tough budget or a good budget coming forward.

1899
04:26:51,090 --> 04:26:53,170
[SPEAKER_24]: It's gonna be very time consuming and

1900
04:26:53,720 --> 04:26:56,021
[SPEAKER_24]: trying to get our kids back to school full time.

1901
04:26:56,101 --> 04:26:58,262
[SPEAKER_24]: That's my number one priority.

1902
04:26:59,603 --> 04:27:06,646
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'll leave it up to the rest of the committee to decide that either tonight or Wednesday as a whole.

1903
04:27:07,146 --> 04:27:12,829
[SPEAKER_24]: I know member Rousseau and then we have Anne Marie and David like to speak again for a minute or two each.

1904
04:27:15,530 --> 04:27:18,251
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm confused if we're going to start doing this now or not.

1905
04:27:19,092 --> 04:27:21,293
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Wednesday's whole meeting was dedicated to this.

1906
04:27:22,513 --> 04:27:38,023
[SPEAKER_14]: So either we do it all now or we do it all Wednesday, but if we're going to dig a little now, then I'm going to keep digging and let's make a motion to send both of these to the to the committee of the whole on Wednesday.

1907
04:27:38,043 --> 04:27:38,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1908
04:27:40,704 --> 04:27:47,528
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham, let the two presidents speak and we'll call the roll.

1909
04:27:47,548 --> 04:27:48,689
[SPEAKER_24]: Annemarie.

1910
04:27:52,898 --> 04:27:53,879
[SPEAKER_26]: You're muted, Anne-Marie.

1911
04:27:55,801 --> 04:27:57,442
[SPEAKER_26]: Anne-Marie, we can't hear you.

1912
04:27:57,722 --> 04:27:58,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm here.

1913
04:27:58,983 --> 04:28:04,789
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, listening to everyone, again, I mean, what everybody's put on the table is extremely important.

1914
04:28:05,489 --> 04:28:07,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally agree about the non-rushing.

1915
04:28:07,831 --> 04:28:17,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that even with that being said, there might be members that don't believe that it's a rushed decision, but I think

1916
04:28:18,741 --> 04:28:26,486
[SPEAKER_06]: member credits for bringing up the no name situation, because I know that that's been out there and people were concerned about that.

1917
04:28:27,147 --> 04:28:39,135
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, you know it's time is of the essence, and you have so much going on that now you're here this evening, you've already spoken about it, I understand how the rules go.

1918
04:28:40,353 --> 04:28:48,941
[SPEAKER_06]: But now you're going to spend Wednesday night discussing this all over again and going into it in more depth and detail.

1919
04:28:49,641 --> 04:28:57,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess stepping back and looking at what's going on and what's being asked of from cities and towns all over the state.

1920
04:28:59,170 --> 04:29:03,055
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems that that time that you're spending on this.

1921
04:29:03,776 --> 04:29:08,563
[SPEAKER_06]: No one is saying that, at least, I'm not saying that it's never going to happen.

1922
04:29:08,643 --> 04:29:14,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying the priority of the dates and the time that you have and what you need to spend it on.

1923
04:29:15,231 --> 04:29:16,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1924
04:29:16,771 --> 04:29:24,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I truly believe that the time should be spent on getting the kids back in school, what the game plan is, how much money is it going to cost?

1925
04:29:24,353 --> 04:29:27,994
[SPEAKER_06]: You have custodians that are going to have to be cleaning a lot more than what they're doing now.

1926
04:29:28,734 --> 04:29:30,674
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what do you have in the budget set aside?

1927
04:29:30,694 --> 04:29:32,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's a lot going on.

1928
04:29:33,235 --> 04:29:39,156
[SPEAKER_06]: So I respectfully just say, you know, it's really to look at your timeframe.

1929
04:29:40,036 --> 04:29:41,997
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. McKillop.

1930
04:29:42,297 --> 04:29:43,737
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we will call the roll.

1931
04:29:44,847 --> 04:29:45,808
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you really quick.

1932
04:29:46,248 --> 04:30:00,836
[SPEAKER_34]: I just want to kind of go back to my suggestion because I, unless I missed it, I don't think anybody really answered whether they wanted to come together as a committee and decide to maybe possibly pull this back and have more conversation.

1933
04:30:01,697 --> 04:30:05,679
[SPEAKER_34]: I am just looking at this committee as a whole in this time.

1934
04:30:06,059 --> 04:30:13,884
[SPEAKER_34]: You have to look at it in this time and what everyone has been going through in this city and be committee

1935
04:30:14,841 --> 04:30:17,443
[SPEAKER_34]: be a committee that will pull the community together.

1936
04:30:18,163 --> 04:30:37,554
[SPEAKER_34]: And if this is the one issue that they need time to absorb and understand, whether it be one way or the other, I say be the bold initiative, take the bold initiative and step back and really give everybody the opportunity to understand what it is that we're doing and why we're doing it.

1937
04:30:38,628 --> 04:30:43,691
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that the decision was made, I get it, but decisions can be changed.

1938
04:30:43,931 --> 04:30:50,895
[SPEAKER_34]: You have to understand, and I always teach my people, that a person's perception is their reality.

1939
04:30:51,684 --> 04:30:56,287
[SPEAKER_34]: So if you think, oh, that's their perception, they didn't, we did communicate, but that's their perception.

1940
04:30:56,787 --> 04:30:58,028
[SPEAKER_34]: That's their reality.

1941
04:30:58,128 --> 04:31:01,911
[SPEAKER_34]: They live that reality that they feel like they haven't been communicated with.

1942
04:31:02,451 --> 04:31:04,672
[SPEAKER_34]: And you folks are the leaders.

1943
04:31:04,853 --> 04:31:06,033
[SPEAKER_34]: You're the team leaders.

1944
04:31:06,073 --> 04:31:07,054
[SPEAKER_34]: You're the team spirit.

1945
04:31:07,094 --> 04:31:09,335
[SPEAKER_34]: We talk about school and Ms.

1946
04:31:09,355 --> 04:31:11,937
[SPEAKER_34]: Van der Kloot talked about these young people.

1947
04:31:12,317 --> 04:31:16,320
[SPEAKER_34]: This is an opportunity to show that we can change our minds.

1948
04:31:16,420 --> 04:31:17,781
[SPEAKER_34]: We can move the needle.

1949
04:31:18,445 --> 04:31:21,326
[SPEAKER_34]: And you folks have the opportunity to do that.

1950
04:31:21,886 --> 04:31:23,627
[SPEAKER_34]: And I really, really hope you think about it.

1951
04:31:24,227 --> 04:31:24,847
[SPEAKER_34]: Think hard.

1952
04:31:25,248 --> 04:31:25,848
[SPEAKER_34]: Think long.

1953
04:31:26,828 --> 04:31:31,250
[SPEAKER_34]: If you move this resolution through without taking any of that into consideration,

1954
04:31:32,727 --> 04:31:35,549
[SPEAKER_34]: It's just disappointing to see which way this may go.

1955
04:31:35,649 --> 04:31:37,371
[SPEAKER_34]: So just really think about that, folks.

1956
04:31:37,891 --> 04:31:38,632
[SPEAKER_34]: You're the team.

1957
04:31:38,672 --> 04:31:39,592
[SPEAKER_34]: You're the team leaders.

1958
04:31:39,612 --> 04:31:42,314
[SPEAKER_34]: You're the ones that can really motivate this city to move forward.

1959
04:31:42,955 --> 04:31:46,597
[SPEAKER_34]: And really just, in my eyes, ignore what else is going on.

1960
04:31:46,637 --> 04:31:47,358
[SPEAKER_34]: This is Medford.

1961
04:31:47,598 --> 04:31:48,258
[SPEAKER_34]: You're Medford.

1962
04:31:48,619 --> 04:31:49,199
[SPEAKER_34]: You're the team.

1963
04:31:49,880 --> 04:31:50,840
[SPEAKER_34]: And I wish you well with it.

1964
04:31:52,682 --> 04:31:53,002
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1965
04:32:01,696 --> 04:32:03,697
[SPEAKER_24]: Member McLaughlin, will you call the roll?

1966
04:32:06,038 --> 04:32:16,742
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, on the motion to move the motions to our committee of the whole on Wednesday.

1967

[SPEAKER_20]: Let me just get my, sorry, my handy sheet.

1988
04:33:14,637 --> 04:33:24,163
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we make a motion also that this is, or can we, I guess it doesn't need to be a motion, it could just be a request that the Committee of the Whole is put into the patch
