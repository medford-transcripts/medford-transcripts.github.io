1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,190
[SPEAKER_09]: The secretary will call the roll.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Mrs. Medvedev.

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,792
Present.

00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:10,672
Press.

00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,093
Mrs. Miston.

Here.

9
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:14,953
Mr. Ruggiero.

10
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:15,334
Here.

11
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:16,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo.

12
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:17,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

13
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:18,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Vindman.

14
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:18,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

15
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:19,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Clark.

16
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:20,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

17
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:21,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven present, none absent.

18
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:23,036
[SPEAKER_09]: All please rise and salute our flag.

19
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:30,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,

20
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,372
[SPEAKER_08]: One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

21
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:39,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

22
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloot, you're blinking.

23
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:42,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that an error?

24
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:43,974
[SPEAKER_09]: You're blinking.

25
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:46,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

26
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval of minutes of December 18, 2017 meeting.

27
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:49,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto?

28
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:01,204
[SPEAKER_17]: to know how the tutoring at the Columbus School is going.

29
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:03,566
[SPEAKER_17]: They're in the meeting minutes.

30
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:07,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent, how is the tutoring at the Columbus School going?

31
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Diane will answer that.

32
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:11,610
[SPEAKER_01]: We've put things in place, but there's some things to go.

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,190
[SPEAKER_01]: It still has to happen.

34
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:15,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Mr. Benedetto.

35
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:15,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

36
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:20,774
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tutoring for the Columbus Elementary School students will begin next Tuesday.

37
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:22,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're excited.

38
00:01:22,755 --> 00:01:26,717
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of students in the third, fourth, and fifth grade.

39
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:38,637
[SPEAKER_02]: We have teachers, all the four third grade teachers would like to participate, plus we have some volunteers from the Medford High School that would like to come in and work with our third graders.

40
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:46,422
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two grade four teachers that are willing to tutor, and a special education, and a grade five teacher.

41
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:48,163
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're well on our way.

42
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:53,486
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still working with the Eastern Bus Service, and hopefully we'll have everything in place by next Tuesday.

43
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:54,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

44
00:01:54,371 --> 00:02:00,836
[SPEAKER_17]: And we are reminding that if we have extra room on the buses, that we're going to fill it up.

45
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:02,357
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have extra room.

46
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:03,397
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been saying that.

47
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:09,602
[SPEAKER_02]: But we just need to make sure that Tatiana is able to get the routes in place, because that takes a little bit of time.

48
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:10,182
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

49
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:11,263
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, we do have room.

50
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:12,023
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

51
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:13,384
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you so much.

52
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:16,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe afternoon clubs or something, kids that wouldn't be able to access them.

53
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:23,151
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that there is a bus, if we can fill it with some of those students, it would open up those opportunities

54
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,952
[SPEAKER_17]: for people whose parents can't pick them up early?

55
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:26,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

56
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:30,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to provide you with an additional report once we get started with the tutoring, too.

57
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:31,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

58
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all your work on that.

59
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:32,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

60
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:33,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

61
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:33,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

62
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:34,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone?

63
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:35,880
[SPEAKER_09]: You're blinking.

64
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,160
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

65
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:37,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

66
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:38,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloot?

67
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:39,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion of approval.

68
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:40,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval.

69
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:41,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second on the floor?

70
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:42,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Ms.

71
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Kratz.

72
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:43,786
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

73
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:43,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

74
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:45,468
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

75
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

76
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

77
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:52,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto?

78
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,142
[SPEAKER_17]: I had a few questions.

79
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,872
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had a question on page 11.

80
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:00,373
[SPEAKER_17]: It says.

81
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:07,549
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I could, just before you go there, Christine is not able to be here tonight.

82
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,630
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may not be familiar with everything that's there.

83
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we could just hold it for another week.

84
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:13,691
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

85
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:19,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't I ask him if it needs each item, if we can resolve them, we can move forward and vote on them.

86
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Or perhaps the secretary may know.

87
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:21,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

88
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:22,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Page 11 of 19.

89
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:29,562
[SPEAKER_17]: 3 quarters of the way down.

90
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:43,068
[SPEAKER_17]: It says middle 6 pot middle 6 partnerships of or for and it's in the amount of $3376.81 and it says pending classification.

91
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:48,910
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was just wondering what that was for and what classification that would be under.

92
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:50,673
[SPEAKER_17]: And you may not know that.

93
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:51,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the grant.

94
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the grant.

95
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:59,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I can answer that one.

96
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:03,556
[SPEAKER_01]: The Middlesex Partnership for Youth is a longstanding alliance we have.

97
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:10,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally started with the District Attorney's Office, has now moved independently because of certain regulatory requirements.

98
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,659
[SPEAKER_01]: But they provide multiple workshops and multiple collaborations with regard to

99
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:18,246
[SPEAKER_01]: substance abuse, child abuse, mental health, all kinds.

100
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,406
[SPEAKER_01]: We run all kinds of workshops.

101
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:22,147
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an annual membership that allows us to participate.

102
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:22,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

103
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:24,888
[SPEAKER_17]: So that explains that.

104
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:27,408
[SPEAKER_17]: It just was cut off, so it didn't say for youth.

105
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:29,849
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate the clarification.

106
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:32,590
[SPEAKER_17]: So the next question is on page 15 of 19.

107
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,771
[SPEAKER_17]: And it says Commonwealth of Mass in the amount of $3,025.85.

108
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,951
[SPEAKER_17]: And it says return to grantor for classification.

109
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,241
[SPEAKER_17]: or account description.

110
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:48,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me take a good look at that one.

111
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Page 15 of January 12th.

112
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:54,524
[SPEAKER_09]: It's up above a third down.

113
00:04:55,325 --> 00:05:00,887
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a function of funds that went unused because they could not be applied.

114
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:08,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes what happens, these things are for fringe benefits and the like, and if they're not applicable, we can't expend on them and then we have to return to the commonwealth at the end of the grant period.

115
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:11,292
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can get more specific once I get in behind it.

116
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:14,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, because we want to use every dollar that they give us.

117
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:16,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sometimes, you know, the categories don't match up.

118
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,212
[SPEAKER_17]: And so my last question is similar to that.

119
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:21,552
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on page 17 of 19.

120
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:26,615
[SPEAKER_17]: And it says the Mass Department of Elementary and Secondary.

121
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,297
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's a refund grant for $32.50, $59.

122
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,899
[SPEAKER_17]: I just don't want to give money back once they've given it to us.

123
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:34,519
[SPEAKER_17]: Where is this again?

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,240
[SPEAKER_17]: On page 17 of 19.

125
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:37,141
[SPEAKER_17]: Up here.

126
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,102
[SPEAKER_17]: Under Mass Department of Elementary.

127
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:41,023
[SPEAKER_17]: It's about six or seven down.

128
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:45,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's probably for a category that we can't use.

129
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,361
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it's more than most likely to infringe benefits.

130
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:52,222
[SPEAKER_01]: If a person doesn't take something, we have to put it in the grant.

131
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:56,685
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they don't take the benefit, we can't expend against it.

132
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:59,886
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make a transfer, and sometimes they allow it, and sometimes they don't.

133
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:00,066
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

134
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:05,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I just want to make sure they use every dollar that we can.

135
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:05,669
[SPEAKER_17]: We'd like to.

136
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Ruggiero?

137
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:10,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Question by Mr. Ruggiero.

138
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:12,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I have three questions.

139
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Just walk me through them.

140
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,822
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can't answer them tonight, that's fine.

141
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:19,725
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is on page 1 of 19.

142
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:24,770
[SPEAKER_05]: The miscellaneous high school charges of $11,000.

143
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you just explore what that is?

144
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:30,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is that again?

145
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:31,897
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first line item.

146
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:33,158
[SPEAKER_05]: First line.

147
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:34,239
[SPEAKER_05]: First page, first line.

148
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Student activities.

149
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,561
[SPEAKER_05]: That's student activity accounts.

150
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:37,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, okay.

151
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And the next two that follow.

152
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:39,999
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

153
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:46,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And do we normally break down the schools by activity, or by group, or is it just all lumped in there?

154
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:46,224
[SPEAKER_05]: By school.

155
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:47,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's Medford High School.

156
00:06:47,245 --> 00:06:47,785
[SPEAKER_05]: It's by school.

157
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:48,246
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

158
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:50,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

159
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:51,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Van de Kloot.

160
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:55,271
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually was the one who signed this particular warrant.

161
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:58,914
[SPEAKER_13]: And every time we go in,

162
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:11,583
[SPEAKER_13]: There's different groups of bills, and the activities account will say whether a club ordered pizza, whether money is put aside for the senior special day or whatever.

163
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:19,450
[SPEAKER_13]: So all of the bills are separate, but they're lump-summed in this one account when it reports out to us.

164
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:30,747
[SPEAKER_13]: However, the secretary, who's now Kathy, of course, will see every bill and sign the lump sum, but she sees every single one that we sign.

165
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:34,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it possible in the future that we could have this broken down by club?

166
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'd be interested to know if certain clubs.

167
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:39,952
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's with the bill.

168
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:40,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

169
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:41,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Kretz sees that with the bill signing.

170
00:07:41,773 --> 00:07:44,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so when you get the bill, it's this big batch.

171
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:48,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And every single receipt is behind.

172
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:50,078
[SPEAKER_07]: So the total amount will be $11,904.

173
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:53,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there'll be line items and receipts to match every single item.

174
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:03,826
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd be happy to show you if you want to come down one day on Wednesday, then you can sit next to me.

175
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:06,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes about three hours, and we can go do it.

176
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:06,808
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

177
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:07,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

178
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:08,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Just out of curiosity.

179
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:08,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

180
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:09,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, definitely.

181
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:17,015
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it would be nice to have another person trained, because it is something you have to do every week in case I couldn't make it for some reason.

182
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:23,499
[SPEAKER_07]: It does have to be done by Wednesday, because then they have to run the warrants, and then they call Joe and invite him.

183
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,443
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, so anytime, just text me and you can come and see.

184
00:08:28,803 --> 00:08:34,868
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really interesting because even glue that's 98 cents, there'll be a receipt for it.

185
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:37,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, 25 cents, I've seen receipts.

186
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's been very, very interesting.

187
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:44,295
[SPEAKER_05]: This next line item, it's on the same page.

188
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,837
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the American Alarm Company.

189
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this every quarter or are these monthly charges?

190
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:58,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just curious about that breakdown and how that line up works.

191
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:03,745
[SPEAKER_01]: So American Alarm is involved with our security and camera systems and the like.

192
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:10,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the specifics of each one of these, but I'm sure it's tied into the fact we've just installed additional security pieces.

193
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:13,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suspect that those are charges that are associated with that.

194
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:14,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I see, okay.

195
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:19,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe I have one more question.

196
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:26,365
[SPEAKER_05]: On the West Medford auto supply, this is the last page on page 19 of 19.

197
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this a wholesaler for our automotive department?

198
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:31,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to clarify.

199
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:32,930
[SPEAKER_09]: The vocational program, yes.

200
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Vocational for the automotive.

201
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:34,752
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

202
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:35,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

203
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:36,173
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

204
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:38,955
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor, seconded for approval.

205
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:39,836
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

206
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:40,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

207
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:41,537
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

208
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:42,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

209
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:42,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:49,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval of payrolls.

211
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:51,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval?

00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:53,369

[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call.

217
00:09:58,212 --> 00:09:59,312

Yes.

[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Van de Kloop.

228
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:09,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

229
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:11,018
[SPEAKER_07]: May I have a vote?

230
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:11,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

231
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:13,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

232
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

233
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:14,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_09]: Report of secretary.

235
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:21,082
[SPEAKER_09]: None?

236
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:21,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

237
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:23,643
[SPEAKER_09]: The organizational, do I need this?

238
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,943
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the report of committees.

239
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:27,023
[SPEAKER_09]: There are none.

240
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:28,444
[SPEAKER_09]: None?

241
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:29,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

242
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:30,864
[SPEAKER_09]: None noted.

243
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:31,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of committees.

244
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:34,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of organizational meeting January 3rd, 2018.

245
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:34,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

246
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:37,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloot ran this meeting.

247
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:41,607
[SPEAKER_13]: So the meeting was called to order by myself at seven o'clock.

248
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:43,807
[SPEAKER_13]: All the school committee members were present.

249
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:47,288
[SPEAKER_13]: I stated at the beginning that this was elected

250
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:51,810
[SPEAKER_13]: The organizational meeting was to elect a vice chairperson and a secretary for the year 2018.

251
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,692
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also that this was the only official task of the senior member.

252
00:10:59,434 --> 00:10:59,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

253
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:04,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Kretz, seconded by Mayor Burke, placed the name of Mia Mastone in nomination for the position of vice chairman.

254
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:11,841
[SPEAKER_13]: The roll call was called, and Mia was universally nominated.

255
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:12,922
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Ms.

256
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:21,446
[SPEAKER_13]: McStone put the name of Kathy Kritz, seconded by Mayor Burke, into nomination for the position of secretary.

257
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:26,729
[SPEAKER_13]: And she was nominated for that position.

258
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,433
[SPEAKER_13]: So we adjourned the meeting at 7 to 1 under new leadership, and it went great.

259
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:34,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

260
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:39,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion for approval of the committee meeting?

261
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:41,016
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

262
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:41,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

263
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:43,199
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

264
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

265
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:44,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

266
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:47,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Next one is not quite ready yet.

267
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:52,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, the Committee of the Whole from January 3rd will be coming to us at our next meeting.

268
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:54,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to table that report.

269
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:56,494
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

270
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:57,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

271
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:58,056
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

272
00:11:58,336 --> 00:11:59,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Papers tabled.

273
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:01,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of Committee of the Whole, January 16th, 2018.

274
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:06,126
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the size of that meeting.

275
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:09,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So this was quite a detailed meeting that we held.

276
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:11,127
[SPEAKER_09]: We called to order.

277
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,168
[SPEAKER_09]: All members of the school committee were present.

278
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:18,229
[SPEAKER_09]: We discussed several items, one being the school meals charge policy.

279
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:20,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you expect to vote on that this evening?

280
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,450
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the agenda as a specific vote.

281
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:23,990
[SPEAKER_09]: So we discussed that.

282
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,771
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be discussed in greater detail later on.

283
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:30,611
[SPEAKER_09]: We also talked about the superintendent search.

284
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:33,112
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could try to go through this.

285
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:38,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Van de Kloot expressed the following.

286
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:44,907
[SPEAKER_09]: She made a motion during our meeting that due to the number of unexpected internal local candidates, potentially there's only two persons.

287
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:49,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we all want the best options, we should consider opening the search to external candidates as well.

288
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:55,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Rather than a two-tiered search, the school committee should conduct one full search, which would include both internal and external candidates.

289
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:59,873
[SPEAKER_09]: We voted during the committee meeting to adopt that, and that is the way we are moving forward.

290
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:26,168
[SPEAKER_09]: We also had the McGlynn PTG Issue that came into our committee of the whole and we heard from the committee treasurer Jane Wright In regards to the various topics that were discussed both in the press as well as in social media And we moved that the school committee adopt some policies and procedures which will be discussed later on in our meeting as well But found that there were no

291
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:32,322
[SPEAKER_09]: No issues with the actual financials of the PTG during the period that was in question.

292
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:43,452
[SPEAKER_09]: During our subcommittee meeting on the superintendent search, we also looked over the application form, which we approved.

293
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:50,716
[SPEAKER_09]: We approved a survey that the committee had been charged with putting together that will go out to survey a monkey at some point.

294
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:53,478
[SPEAKER_09]: We also voted to utilize the Mass.

295
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:57,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Association of School Committees to be our administrative arm for the search.

296
00:13:57,961 --> 00:14:01,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually met with them this afternoon, and they are aware of everything that we did.

297
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:02,784
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be sending them

298
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:11,592
[SPEAKER_09]: PDFs and Word docs of the documents thus far that the committee has worked on so that they can work with those and then input some of the dates.

299
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:18,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a litany of dates that I could list to you, although I'd rather type them up and get them typed tomorrow and I'll circulate them.

300
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,142
[SPEAKER_09]: But the search committee orientation, we're looking to start on February 7th.

301
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:31,467
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, we did a press release today including a copy of the application for those that are interested from the public to apply to be on the search committee.

302
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:33,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And that has a closing date.

303
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:38,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the 29th is when we should get all applications back in.

304
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:39,652
[SPEAKER_09]: So please check out the website.

305
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:45,535
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need a hard copy, call the superintendent's office or certainly my office and we can mail one out to you.

306
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:49,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will get a list of the dates and we'll get that posted up to the website as well.

307
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion for approval of the committee report?

308
00:14:53,563 --> 00:14:53,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

309
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:55,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

310
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:56,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone, seconded by Ms.

311
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:56,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Kretz.

312
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:57,904
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

313
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:58,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

314
00:14:58,884 --> 00:14:59,704
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

315
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:01,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

316
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:01,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

317
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:04,646
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, community participation.

318
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:08,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheryl Rodriguez, Roberts PTO Community Preservation Project.

319
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:08,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

320
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:08,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Rodriguez?

321
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:15,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

322
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:18,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, dean of my address.

323
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,088
[SPEAKER_15]: I live at 281 Park Street.

324
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:25,132
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm an active parent volunteer involved in the Roberts PTO.

325
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:30,175
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the things that I do for the school is that I apply for grants.

326
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:37,021
[SPEAKER_15]: So since I'm here, I wanted to let everyone know that we did receive a $5,000 grant from the Lowell's Toolbox for Education.

327
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:47,571
[SPEAKER_15]: It covered about 90% of the cost for 25 Google Chromebooks, the software, and the cart that is now in the school and will be ready for circulation at the end of this week.

328
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:48,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.

329
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:50,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

330
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:57,901
[SPEAKER_15]: And we used money from the Jingle Bell Festival to cover the rest of that cost.

331
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:01,613
[SPEAKER_15]: We made, I don't have the exact figure, but it's a little under $7,000.

332
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,038
[SPEAKER_15]: We were the number one school this year.

333
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:05,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

334
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,144
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was great for them too.

335
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:17,824
[SPEAKER_15]: So today I'm here to ask for support and help for the Roberts PTO's grant application to the Community Preservation Commission for the restoration of our school playground.

336
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:26,692
[SPEAKER_15]: The Roberts Elementary School is one of the most populous elementary schools in Medford and our playground, as are all the elementary school playgrounds, is in need of replacement.

337
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:30,035
[SPEAKER_15]: The worst item in all our playgrounds seems to be the surfacing.

338
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:33,135
[SPEAKER_15]: So I applied for this grant for a few reasons.

339
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:42,420
[SPEAKER_15]: One was that I saw the mayor's capital improvement plan at a city council meeting, and it included line items to replace one school playground per year, which was great.

340
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:51,985
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought if we coupled it with community preservation money, we could replace two playgrounds per year, and everyone could have a new playground in two to three years.

341
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:57,328
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would be about 2,400 students in our elementary schools that would all have a shiny new playground to play in.

342
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:08,241
[SPEAKER_15]: So that benefit would radiate out through the neighborhood that each school is in, because it will allow their family members of the students to enjoy the playgrounds as well as people that just live in the neighborhood.

343
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:15,523
[SPEAKER_15]: We've gone through the eligibility phase, and we now have to prepare a complete application.

344
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:18,944
[SPEAKER_15]: So we don't know exactly how much it's going to cost.

345
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:21,725
[SPEAKER_15]: And we need help from the district in order to

346
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:27,409
[SPEAKER_15]: figure out the parameters of what you'll require, companies that we have to go through.

347
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:34,135
[SPEAKER_15]: This is outside of my scope of expertise, as well as my authority as a parent volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School.

348
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:38,738
[SPEAKER_15]: We were able to apply with a supporting letter from the principal at our school.

349
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,442
[SPEAKER_15]: But in order to go forward, we need approval and help from

350
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:45,638
[SPEAKER_15]: the school committee and the district.

351
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:48,360
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm hoping that we're going to be able to do that.

352
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:52,103
[SPEAKER_15]: The application needs to be submitted by March 2nd.

353
00:17:52,764 --> 00:18:04,993
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hoping that we'll make it through the first round because that will allow for completion to happen in the summer when the students are not in school so that they won't have any interrupted recess time and they'll be able to start September with a shiny new playground.

354
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:19,165
[SPEAKER_15]: If we do receive community preservation funds, there are other grants that we can apply for to help supplement, but we're not eligible to apply for those grants until we receive funding from the community preservation.

355
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:23,808
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm hoping that you guys can help me out.

356
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much why I'm here.

357
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:28,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Superintendent, are there estimates for the new school year?

358
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the estimates vary.

359
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,084
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what we decide should be the surface on those playgrounds because we may not want to go with the same surface.

360
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:42,927
[SPEAKER_01]: We may want something different, something that maybe is a newer product than what we put in place.

361
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:45,058
[SPEAKER_01]: 15, 16 years ago.

362
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,719
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to get a better estimate on that.

363
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,601
[SPEAKER_01]: So while this may be an interesting opportunity, we're also looking at the community preservation grant for other issues as well.

364
00:18:54,081 --> 00:19:02,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Going forward, generally for us in the second round, and I was going to give you some materials on that at a subsequent meeting, because the second round will be coming up as well.

365
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:04,205
[SPEAKER_01]: and to look at a larger picture.

366
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:09,728
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if we, since it's March 2nd, I think we can put it on the table tonight.

367
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:19,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come back with more specifics and try to give you an idea of whether this is feasible under the Community Preservation Grant or whether it needs to go through some other process.

368
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:21,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably the best way to go.

369
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:25,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we're glad to get any funding we can get, appreciate your efforts.

370
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,104
[SPEAKER_01]: But to do this right, this is not a $5,000 or $10,000 expenditure.

371
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:32,026
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be $75,000, $100,000, or more.

372
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:36,871
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not something that's going to be easily acquired from any one source.

373
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:41,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on the floor to request an estimate from various entities?

374
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Ruggiero.

375
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:51,589
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to that motion, I would like to ask that we move this issue to two of our subcommittees.

376
00:19:52,169 --> 00:20:00,697
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is the building and grounds to see how we can move forward on this issue, and also to see if we could do community relations to see if there are any subcontractors in the town

377
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:02,338
[SPEAKER_05]: that would be willing to donate grounds.

378
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:04,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Generally, a paper goes to one committee, not to two.

379
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you send it to Building and Grounds, they could do their homework there with Mr. McLaughlin.

380
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:14,524
[SPEAKER_05]: But in addition to the estimate, I'd like to suggest that we send this issue to Building and Grounds for more research.

381
00:20:15,504 --> 00:20:17,865
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion that the paper be seconded by Ms.

382
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:20,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Mostone, sent to the Building and Grounds subcommittee.

383
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto, did you wish to speak on this?

384
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:29,371
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember recently walking the playgrounds and that some of this preliminary work, John

385
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:35,421
[SPEAKER_17]: John might have already done and had ideas for different materials.

386
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,242
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not a new idea.

387
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,665
[SPEAKER_17]: It's something that we know that we're in great need for.

388
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:44,228
[SPEAKER_17]: And some of the research might have been done.

389
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:47,531
[SPEAKER_17]: But we need to decide what products are best.

390
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:52,755
[SPEAKER_17]: But I believe that we should work with Cheryl to move this forward right away.

391
00:20:54,056 --> 00:20:56,318
[SPEAKER_17]: This was on my wish list when I saw.

392
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:01,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for taking it and running with it and making it come forward.

393
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:04,109
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would like to move forward with this.

394
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:11,872
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sure Mr. McLaughlin already has some ideas of where to call and what types of materials people are using.

395
00:21:12,645 --> 00:21:14,786
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor, seconded by Ms.

396
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone to move this paper into subcommittee building and grounds.

397
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:18,849
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

398
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:19,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

399
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:19,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Speak on this?

400
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:20,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

401
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:20,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

402
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloot?

403
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:24,233
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to thank Cheryl for coming before us.

404
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:30,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheryl, you're great at searching out opportunities to get money for the students at the Robertson.

405
00:21:30,177 --> 00:21:31,117
[SPEAKER_13]: I really appreciate that.

406
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:31,858
Thanks.

407
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:32,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

408
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,120
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, all those in favor?

409
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

410
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:36,821
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

411
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:37,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

412
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:38,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

413
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:38,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Rodriguez.

414
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:39,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

415
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:39,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheryl.

416
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:42,603
[SPEAKER_09]: In a clarification is my stone.

417
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,205
[SPEAKER_14]: I can call a subcommittee for buildings and grounds.

418
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:49,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Aaron, Kathy and I are on it and we invite Cheryl and we can all and John.

419
00:21:49,527 --> 00:21:51,688
[SPEAKER_14]: There she go, Cheryl.

420
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:53,269
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna so we'll meet.

421
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,933
[SPEAKER_14]: So Aaron, Kathy and I are on the subcommittee for buildings and grounds and then I'll just email us all to get together.

422
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:01,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Public meeting, it will be posted for 48 hours.

423
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:01,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

424
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,467
[SPEAKER_09]: In compliance with open meeting law.

425
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:04,388
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you.

426
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:07,769
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want it on the next agenda, it has to happen in between now and the next thing.

427
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So she has a March 2 deadline to submit.

428
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:12,810
[SPEAKER_01]: So before February 2.

429
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:13,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

430
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,611
[SPEAKER_01]: So before February 2.

431
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:14,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

432
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:17,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

433
00:22:17,852 --> 00:22:18,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of superintendent.

434
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:22,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on MASC participation in superintendent search.

435
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:22,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

436
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:28,835
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mayor and members of the committee, earlier in the minutes you heard that we approved

437
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:34,310
[SPEAKER_01]: retaining Massachusetts Association of School Committees to be our agent to advance the search.

438
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:42,778
[SPEAKER_01]: This afternoon, the mayor and I met with Glenn Kuchar, the executive director of MASC, and went over all the different functions and activities that they can assist us with.

439
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:44,159
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's quite substantial.

440
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:51,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, because we pay dues, we're not incurring an additional charge, which we might if we contracted with someone else.

441
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:54,008
[SPEAKER_01]: In the interim,

442
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:01,292
[SPEAKER_01]: We've put a pretty aggressive schedule together, as the mayor indicated, we'll clean it up tonight and get something out to you over the next day or so.

443
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:06,255
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first schedule was obviously the search committee, and the mayor's put something like that out.

444
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:12,518
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the interim, just to give you some information with regard to this particular activity,

445
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:35,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Glenn Kuchar indicated to us that he could distribute our brochure, he could distribute our applications, he could take in the applications as they came in, turn them around very quickly, give us a tiering as to who's eligible and not, just simply by licensure and a few things like that, get it over to the search committee, generally within a day, believe it or not.

446
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:40,518
[SPEAKER_01]: and create the circumstances in which this would go forward.

447
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:50,022
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd also work on creating focus groups and other aspects of this search site visits and other things that you may want to do or not want to do.

448
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:58,446
[SPEAKER_01]: But clearly this will take us into high gear with the idea being that a decision would be made sometime at the beginning of April.

449
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:02,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the path we're on so

450
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:11,036
[SPEAKER_01]: The report I'm giving you right now gives you an idea that he'll get it out to a wide audience to help us screen the applicants to make sure the people are eligible.

451
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:18,642
[SPEAKER_01]: The search committee will get every applicant, whether they consider them eligible or not, in hard copy as well as electronically.

452
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:24,221
[SPEAKER_01]: The survey developed by the school committee, I want to talk to Mr. Rousseau about that.

453
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:28,887
[SPEAKER_01]: He will assist in getting that out and pulling those results together along with the focus groups.

454
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:35,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, pulling it together so that it takes the burden off any one member to do that or the administrations to keep it clean.

455
00:24:38,281 --> 00:24:46,147
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll assist in the preparation of interviews, questions for you to help you develop questions and appropriate information so you can group them properly.

456
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through a process of how they do that.

457
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:54,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, following up with contract negotiations with the successful candidate or the candidate that you select.

458
00:24:54,954 --> 00:24:55,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot here.

459
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:07,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, having an agent on board moves it forward, takes the burden off us to do it, and it keeps us on track to have a decision by April, hopefully.

460
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:15,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the one thing we've got to understand is that when materials come in, it's confidential at this point in time.

461
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:21,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you get something doesn't mean you go talking about who applied, because people are entitled to a certain amount of privacy.

462
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it reaches the final stage, privacy's off.

463
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:33,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people can see it, there'll be public interviews, there'll be all the kinds of things that will give the community total transparency as to the process.

464
00:25:34,438 --> 00:25:43,827
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very extensive, and I think that based on the discussions we had today and based on what you will learn in the next few days, that you'll see this is a very, very wide open search.

465
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,604
[SPEAKER_01]: It's intended to bring in candidates around.

466
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:48,844
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in Lexington tonight.

467
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:54,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Lexington's about to make a decision tonight on its selection and a few other communities that'll be moving forward.

468
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:59,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we'll be excited to see pools of candidates come into our program.

469
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:03,628
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I think that gives you an update on MASC's involvement.

470
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:05,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Quickly came to the table with us today.

471
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:10,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, we only did it last week and quickly came to the table today to work out some details.

472
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:15,958
[SPEAKER_09]: At this time, I really would like to thank the committee that got together to put together this survey, led by Ms.

473
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:18,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Vandekloot, Mr. Russo, Ms.

474
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:19,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Kretz, formerly Ms.

475
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:31,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuno, also served prior to January, along with Jenny Graham, a parent who stepped up and actually put the brochure together, a really nice-looking brochure demonstrating the strengths of our community.

476
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:35,722
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to thank all of you for your hard work in such a tight little time frame.

477
00:26:36,182 --> 00:26:40,943
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you do have any of the documents, including the survey, if you could get it to us so that we can get it to Glenn.

478
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:43,767
[SPEAKER_09]: So he can start to get them formalized and out the door.

479
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:49,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Just if we will, we have to go over a couple of things because it's on your account and we need to move it over.

480
00:26:49,836 --> 00:26:53,081
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of technical things that we're going to have to do.

481
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:05,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Superintendent Belson, is it possible that Glenn could put on a presentation for the community?

482
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:07,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he's seen a lot of these superintendent searches.

483
00:27:08,004 --> 00:27:08,764
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be really helpful.

484
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:09,185
[SPEAKER_05]: He is.

485
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:16,192
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to actually put together focus groups for not only the citizenry at large, but also internally for teachers and administrators.

486
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,011
[SPEAKER_09]: We will not be at the administrative meeting, because they like to kind of do things with just him.

487
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:30,696
[SPEAKER_09]: But we certainly, he will be putting something on for the public, as well as the school committee, and the ultimate search committee as well, to say like the do's and the don'ts.

488
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,877
[SPEAKER_09]: If certain questions are legal, you cannot ask.

489
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:37,559
[SPEAKER_09]: So everyone needs to be apprised of that and stick to that, because it's a discriminatory practice.

490
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:40,540
[SPEAKER_09]: So he will give us all guidance as we move along.

491
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And tomorrow, I'll have a group of dates that shows when we think we're going to hit these milestones.

492
00:27:46,258 --> 00:27:46,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

493
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, the multitude of activities that you'll see will indicate this is going to be a very public process.

494
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:53,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

495
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Vandekloot.

496
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:55,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor.

497
00:27:56,551 --> 00:28:01,952
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to mention, though, and I'm all for the MASC taking over this.

498
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:03,973
[SPEAKER_13]: When we voted on it last week, I put it forth.

499
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:09,914
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I do think that there is a cost incurred, and it's an appropriate cost.

500
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:12,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that all of these services are completely free.

501
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:16,076
[SPEAKER_13]: So since you said free, I just don't want to mislead anybody in that.

502
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:21,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there'll be some cost for materials that we have to pass out and things like that, but we're not talking about search consultants.

503
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:26,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on what I've talked about.

504
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:26,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

505
00:28:26,668 --> 00:28:30,150
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he gave us the number around 9,000 or so.

506
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,012
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for full search done by them, totally by them.

507
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:34,273
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already put some things together.

508
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:36,274
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already done quite a bit.

509
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:39,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's different.

510
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:43,499
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get a number, but the number is not what would have been for a full search if they did it from scratch.

511
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:43,919
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

512
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:44,820
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to be clear.

513
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good, is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

514
00:28:49,011 --> 00:28:49,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

515
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:50,512
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved, Ms.

516
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:51,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Argyro, Ms.

517
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:51,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Kretz.

518
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:52,773
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

519
00:28:53,053 --> 00:28:53,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

520
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:54,254
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

521
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:56,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries, thank you.

522
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:02,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation to begin search for foreign language director, school year 18-19.

523
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:10,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm telling you tonight that Rita DeCarlo, done an outstanding job for us in foreign language, has announced her retirement.

524
00:29:12,658 --> 00:29:13,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important area for us.

525
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,320
[SPEAKER_01]: She spent over 30 years.

526
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm telling you that I want to begin the search at this point in time for a replacement.

527
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:29,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will do it the usual way we do it, where we have some candidates come in, we screen them down, and then we give you a chance to look at the top three candidates that come to you.

528
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll give us feedback, and then we make an appointment.

529
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:34,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to get going with that.

530
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:41,918
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've actually spoke with the superintendent and asked that our diversity and inclusion director, Neil Osborne, be a part of the preliminary interviews.

531
00:29:44,144 --> 00:29:46,446
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a motion to receive and place this on file.

532
00:29:46,506 --> 00:29:48,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

533
00:29:48,628 --> 00:29:49,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloot.

534
00:29:49,168 --> 00:29:49,949
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

535
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,490
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

536
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:52,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carried.

537
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:52,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Burke.

538
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:53,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

539
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:53,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Van de Kloot.

540
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:59,717
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure we'll have an opportunity later on to congratulate Mrs. DiCarlo and thank her for her work.

541
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:02,039
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can't let the moment pass.

542
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:04,301
[SPEAKER_13]: She's been an asset to our community.

543
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:05,602
[SPEAKER_13]: She's a great lady.

544
00:30:06,283 --> 00:30:11,547
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will certainly need to celebrate her tenure with us and her retirement.

545
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:12,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

546
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:17,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Item three, report on DESE, Leading the Nation initiative.

547
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:18,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

548
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:29,057
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has launched an initiative which will celebrate Massachusetts and Massachusetts' achievements as leading the nation.

549
00:30:29,657 --> 00:30:34,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts, as you know, leads the nation in typical test scores and other kinds of indicators.

550
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:46,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you look at the PISA results, the international results, if Massachusetts counts itself as a nation, which we do in the rankings, we're always very close to the top, if not on top.

551
00:30:48,178 --> 00:31:00,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts has decided through the department to celebrate that and they've begun a project to provide a statewide platform for public schools in Massachusetts to celebrate their great achievements.

552
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:06,879
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already begun to pull together highlights and other things that are particular to us that go beyond testing.

553
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:23,931
[SPEAKER_01]: that highlight the kinds of educational programs that we're running, that we believe make Massachusetts not only tops in those categories of testing, but actually makes Massachusetts, in places like Medford, renowned for doing some terrific programs, whether it's Global Scholars, CCSR,

554
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:27,312
[SPEAKER_01]: or other things that you have heard about over the years.

555
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:32,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make you aware of it, because we're going to start to ramp up very soon.

556
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:35,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope that you'll all participate.

557
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:44,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see some of the things that are going to go on statewide at the Statehouse and other activities, which will give us an opportunity to highlight our school systems.

558
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:53,239
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also use our various media to talk about the things that are going well in our community and neighboring communities and the things we collaborate with.

559
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just an informational piece for you right now to let you know and welcome any ideas that you may have.

560
00:31:59,382 --> 00:32:00,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

561
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:01,923
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

562
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:08,706
[SPEAKER_17]: On this subject, first of all, I think this is great in any way that we can highlight the work that our children and our community does.

563
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:21,532
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's marvelous, especially not only through this, but in general, I think we need to publicize more and more about the great opportunities that children of Method have and the great learning experiences they

564
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:23,866
[SPEAKER_17]: they show our community.

565
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:34,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Based on that, I also wanted to ask you about the new commissioner for DESC, and they finalized the last, down to three.

566
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:40,793
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually got some interviews going on, I believe, the end of this week.

567
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:55,762
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be interviewing, they've narrowed it down to three finalists, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of New York, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of Texas, and the current superintendent of the Lawrence Public Schools have been designated as the three finalists.

568
00:32:56,463 --> 00:33:05,969
[SPEAKER_01]: The board will interview them and potentially even next week, they'll make a decision and make their recommendation to the Secretary of Education, Mr. Pizer.

569
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:11,160
[SPEAKER_01]: will have an affirmation or a veto at his discretion.

570
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:17,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we'll have someone in place very soon in that role.

571
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:20,114
[SPEAKER_01]: When that person will actually take office, I don't know.

572
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:24,635
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably depends on their current contracts and their current obligations.

573
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:33,137
[SPEAKER_01]: But I assume that in the interim, Jeff Wilson will continue to be the acting commissioner until that person can actually assume the role.

574
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:35,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So we expect that to happen fairly soon.

575
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll get you posted as soon as I know.

576
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:45,118
[SPEAKER_17]: So in addition to that, any idea of what direction any of these new commissioners are going to go?

577
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,561
[SPEAKER_01]: They've named three finalists.

578
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:53,824
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I want to speculate, I might have thoughts, but it would be inappropriate.

579
00:33:54,285 --> 00:33:55,225
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

580
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:57,067
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to keep a close eye on this.

581
00:33:57,427 --> 00:33:58,908
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that you do.

582
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:06,093
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just when a new commissioner comes in, new regulations, new mandates, different things.

583
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:12,698
[SPEAKER_17]: And not only do you have to advocate for that, but our next superintendent also has to have the wherewithal to do that as well.

584
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:13,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep you posted.

585
00:34:14,993 --> 00:34:15,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

586
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:19,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion to accept the report and place on file?

587
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:20,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded.

588
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:21,676
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

589
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:23,077
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

590
00:34:23,577 --> 00:34:24,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

591
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:31,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on statewide accommodations for culturally responsive religious observances.

592
00:34:32,102 --> 00:34:38,285
[SPEAKER_01]: So as our community becomes culturally and religiously diverse more so than

593
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,382
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been, although, you know, it's quite a change.

594
00:34:42,422 --> 00:34:46,404
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1982, 4% of our school population were persons of color.

595
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:47,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, it's close to 38%.

596
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:51,527
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an idea of what's taken place over time.

597
00:34:53,668 --> 00:35:07,035
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we become more culturally diverse and religiously diverse, it's incumbent upon us to actively ensure that our students, employees, citizens are treated with respect and dignity, and that they celebrate their personal cultures and religious observances.

598
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:14,375
[SPEAKER_01]: So adopting appropriate inclusive holidays, observances, protocols does not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution.

599
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:19,020
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference between establishing religion and just allowing people to celebrate.

600
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:21,463
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a distinct difference.

601
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:27,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather it protects it by recognizing the rich diversity of people's experiences.

602
00:35:28,032 --> 00:35:30,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts laws prohibit discrimination in all its forms.

603
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:38,360
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way to ensure that discrimination does not occur is to educate our students and community through positive learning and experience.

604
00:35:39,101 --> 00:35:49,609
[SPEAKER_01]: We must always seek to move forward, to go beyond toleration to understanding, an enlightened understanding for both our diverse and common human heritage.

605
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:59,629
[SPEAKER_01]: The topic is far too involved to have a broad discussion this evening, but we need to invest more time through focus groups and additional sessions.

606
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:05,093
[SPEAKER_01]: In the interim, I've provided you with some materials in preparation for a more robust discussion.

607
00:36:05,594 --> 00:36:16,261
[SPEAKER_01]: And we certainly will include people, and I've listed holidays and other things that deal with inclusive practices that have been put out by various agencies that are known for their expertise in this area.

608
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:26,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, this is not only a local thing, it's a national thing, it's a statewide thing, and for us to be in the forefront of it is very important.

609
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:33,054
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good things happening in our community already, but the price of doing the right thing is eternal vigilance.

610
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:37,916
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be diligent with it, you can't let it slip, and we have a lot of things going on.

611
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:53,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And different things will occur, and there'll be some people that perhaps don't understand it, but it's our job to make sure that everyone feels protected, feels safe, and that we don't have any situation where a person feels isolated because of the policies and practices of our school system.

612
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:55,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

613
00:36:56,979 --> 00:36:58,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place on file.

614
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:58,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

615
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Mostone, question?

616
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:01,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

617
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:11,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so you had listed on our packet, the state of New Jersey has a resolution, the list of religious holidays permitting student absence from school and there's a long list.

618
00:37:11,193 --> 00:37:13,114
[SPEAKER_14]: So is that something that we could consider?

619
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:21,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what we do is you, I'll probably recognize the fact that if a person's out for those holidays and documents it as an excuse.

620
00:37:22,502 --> 00:37:22,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

621
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:24,343
[SPEAKER_14]: But we don't have a resolution on fire.

622
00:37:24,704 --> 00:37:24,864
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

623
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:26,365
[SPEAKER_14]: So is this something that we know?

624
00:37:27,293 --> 00:37:29,014
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually had a practice of doing this.

625
00:37:29,154 --> 00:37:31,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so you're just showing us.

626
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:32,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

627
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:36,977
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, this report be placed on file.

628
00:37:36,997 --> 00:37:37,717
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

629
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:37,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

630
00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:39,838
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

631
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:41,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion has it.

632
00:37:41,278 --> 00:37:41,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

633
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:47,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on protocols for school closing due to inclement weather.

634
00:37:48,721 --> 00:37:54,043
[SPEAKER_01]: So every year we go through various stages of why we close school and why we keep open.

635
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:59,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people understand it, and some people agree, and some people don't agree.

636
00:37:59,602 --> 00:38:06,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the last little while, the people who are more aggressively emailing me are generally students.

637
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:08,228
[SPEAKER_09]: High school students, in particular.

638
00:38:08,248 --> 00:38:08,769
[SPEAKER_01]: High school students.

639
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:20,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally around 8 o'clock or the morning before a storm, I'm getting things being told that their life is being put in peril, and we're endangering them and their families.

640
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:24,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And I write back to them as courteously as I possibly can.

641
00:38:25,285 --> 00:38:29,288
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, people do understand it.

642
00:38:29,328 --> 00:38:35,091
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to take a little bit of opportunity in between storms, if you will, to go over a couple of things.

643
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:42,056
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people are listening, and we'll put it on our website again, they'll get an idea as to how we make these decisions.

644
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,021
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to keep open if we can.

645
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:48,903
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many youngsters out there who have no one supervising them if we close the schools.

646
00:38:49,683 --> 00:38:53,785
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many youngsters out there who have no one feeding them if we close the schools.

647
00:38:54,746 --> 00:39:05,572
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, if conditions warrant it, having youngsters out in the cold and driving snow, possibly with vehicles sliding on the road, has to be balanced.

648
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:08,077
[SPEAKER_01]: with our decision to open the schools.

649
00:39:08,657 --> 00:39:12,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Parents always have the opportunity to make a decision.

650
00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:24,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they documented that they kept the youngster home because of the weather, and we have a reason to believe that the weather was that way, we will provide an excused absence.

651
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:35,010
[SPEAKER_01]: If, in fact, a youngster comes to us late on a day when conditions are such, rather than delay the whole day, which could mess up a number of things for a number of people,

652
00:39:36,304 --> 00:39:40,229
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't mark them tardy to the extent that there's a reasonable arrival.

653
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:45,054
[SPEAKER_01]: If they come in two minutes before the closing, we might think that that's not reasonable.

654
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:52,403
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're an hour or so late, that's not a bad problem for us to recognize that as part of travel conditions.

655
00:39:53,264 --> 00:39:55,506
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're entering the winter season.

656
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,507
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the winter season.

657
00:39:57,504 --> 00:40:04,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And from year to year, we may have more or less closings because of weather, or cold, or any other number of reasons.

658
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:09,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Or for some reason that there's a building problem, or a safety problem that's different.

659
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:14,372
[SPEAKER_01]: We will use our media to inform people.

660
00:40:14,432 --> 00:40:15,933
[SPEAKER_01]: We use all the television media.

661
00:40:15,973 --> 00:40:18,294
[SPEAKER_01]: We use our own media to put things out.

662
00:40:18,314 --> 00:40:19,995
[SPEAKER_01]: We use robocalls.

663
00:40:20,395 --> 00:40:24,417
[SPEAKER_01]: We do everything we possibly can to let people know as soon as possible.

664
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:26,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this last storm,

665
00:40:26,997 --> 00:40:31,360
[SPEAKER_01]: had to wait till almost six o'clock in the morning to take a good hard look to see what would come in.

666
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I knew in this area, we weren't going to get much snow.

667
00:40:36,563 --> 00:40:42,907
[SPEAKER_01]: But a little to the west and a little to the north and the southeast, they got snow and they got bad conditions.

668
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:48,311
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a tough one because we weren't sure what actually would happen, how we would track.

669
00:40:48,331 --> 00:40:53,474
[SPEAKER_01]: The one before, people asked me, why didn't you call off school on that Tuesday when it was cold?

670
00:40:53,974 --> 00:40:56,256
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had called off school on that Tuesday when it was cold,

671
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:59,855
[SPEAKER_01]: we would have been out Thursday and Friday anyway.

672
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,555
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have had one day of school that week because Monday was a holiday.

673
00:41:03,316 --> 00:41:07,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you just have to balance it a little bit and think about what's going to happen.

674
00:41:08,097 --> 00:41:11,398
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have to think about the fact that teachers and others come from distance.

675
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:17,239
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they have young people of their own that have to stay home with, they may not come in.

676
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:23,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they have the travel arrangements coming from the north or the south, it may not work for them to be in and on time.

677
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:25,001
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not be a productive day.

678
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:27,895
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all kinds of considerations.

679
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:45,331
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to pay attention to whether DPW and the contractors can clear out lots, whether we think that the bus buses can actually make it up and go in the various routes, whether the bus stops and the sidewalks have had an opportunity to be cleared to the greatest extent possible, although it's never perfect.

680
00:41:45,812 --> 00:41:46,813
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very rarely perfect.

681
00:41:47,628 --> 00:41:49,870
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of considerations that we have to look at.

682
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:58,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I do talk to area colleagues as we come into this kind of season and we take a look and see what's happening and we try to make decisions that way.

683
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:08,788
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very important for people to understand that schools provide safety, it provides warmth, it provides nutrition to many youngsters.

684
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:11,251
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't take school closings lightly.

685
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:19,481
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we think that safety is an issue, if we think that we can't clear the lots, we don't think we're going to have a productive day, we will call it.

686
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:24,022
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will try to call it as early as possible, often the night before.

687
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:30,465
[SPEAKER_01]: But some days it's not, we don't know until five o'clock in the morning, just the way it is.

688
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:35,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

689
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:52,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Recently the DESC put out some new, I don't know, they didn't come up with regulations yet, but new discussion about possibilities of having students do work that had been prepared for them so that if we

690
00:42:53,034 --> 00:43:00,536
[SPEAKER_13]: had an elongated time out, there was an option other than tacking on school days at the end or whatever.

691
00:43:01,737 --> 00:43:03,857
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't read it completely.

692
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:06,658
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thinking that we would be talking about it.

693
00:43:07,438 --> 00:43:19,822
[SPEAKER_13]: I definitely think, though I understand that it's complex because you need to make sure that all students can access the work that the teachers prepare for them and that is tricky in our

694
00:43:20,272 --> 00:43:26,976
[SPEAKER_13]: community where not everyone necessarily will have access to a computer, but many will have access to phones now.

695
00:43:27,956 --> 00:43:34,300
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we're in a different age and all the kids that come in to volunteer at the hospital, they're all doing their homework on their phones.

696
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:43,865
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're not prepared to talk about that in depth tonight, I think that we should talk about it in a curriculum subcommittee meeting and plan.

697
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:47,127
[SPEAKER_13]: I see this not so much for the one or two day absence.

698
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:48,308
[SPEAKER_13]: I see this in the,

699
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:58,057
[SPEAKER_13]: how to figure out in the event that we have a prolonged week, say a blizzard, that keeps us all home, how we're going to be proactive about this.

700
00:43:58,957 --> 00:44:07,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just tell you that there are people who, not what you're telling me, we should talk in the long term, but there are people who rush to do what they call blizzard packs.

701
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:09,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that unproductive.

702
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:12,780
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay our teachers to teach 180 days of school.

703
00:44:16,077 --> 00:44:18,039
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a trade-off to give kids some homework.

704
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:20,282
[SPEAKER_01]: They're supposed to do homework anyway.

705
00:44:20,302 --> 00:44:24,827
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality is that we want our teachers in front of students, and they don't want to trade days.

706
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:36,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we get hit like the storm of 1978, we're out a whole week or ten days or something like that, we could probably have a plan in place to send materials out, especially with today's electronics.

707
00:44:37,698 --> 00:44:43,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should be very careful that we start trading days for short-term days off.

708
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,580
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hear what you're saying.

709
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,481
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's long-term, maybe we should consider it through a meeting.

710
00:44:48,962 --> 00:44:49,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

711
00:44:49,162 --> 00:44:49,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Kratz?

712
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:51,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a question.

713
00:44:52,363 --> 00:45:03,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I did receive several calls from parents who mentioned that the day that school was open, because it was very, very cold, that there was a lot of teachers absent.

714
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:09,785
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of the kids were sent to lecture halls that were not heated, and they were freezing.

715
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:11,907
[SPEAKER_07]: The children were just freezing.

716
00:45:11,927 --> 00:45:12,928
[SPEAKER_07]: This is at the high school.

717
00:45:12,988 --> 00:45:22,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And for example, one student, one of his teachers was in, and all the other classes, he went to freezing cold lecture halls that were not heated.

718
00:45:22,675 --> 00:45:25,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just really, really, really, really cold.

719
00:45:25,898 --> 00:45:28,520
[SPEAKER_07]: And students were wearing gloves, and they had

720
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:33,641
[SPEAKER_07]: the, you know, the little, I forget what they're called, the heat warmers.

721
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:39,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, they had, you know, hand warmers, passing them around, and a lot of kids got sick.

722
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:53,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got a lot of calls about that, and I'm not sure if, you know, I tried to identify, like, what area, you know, and, you know, I just don't know, but it was mainly that it was really, really cold in the high school.

723
00:45:54,288 --> 00:45:54,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

724
00:45:56,808 --> 00:46:00,732
[SPEAKER_01]: We sent you out, you know, on that particular day, I sent you out attendance.

725
00:46:00,812 --> 00:46:05,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high school was not badly attended that day.

726
00:46:05,157 --> 00:46:06,998
[SPEAKER_01]: It was over 80% of the people that were there.

727
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:10,862
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good since normal attendance is in the low 90s, you know.

728
00:46:10,922 --> 00:46:13,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, plus teachers, there weren't that many people.

729
00:46:13,745 --> 00:46:17,169
[SPEAKER_01]: There were people out, but there weren't that many people out comparatively to what could have been out.

730
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:22,015
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the cold goes, part of the issue was the fact that it came on so suddenly.

731
00:46:22,435 --> 00:46:25,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain areas of the building were still trying to adjust.

732
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,760
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can work on the heating system.

733
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,701
[SPEAKER_01]: We can work on different aspects of it.

734
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:32,023
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people were in school.

735
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:39,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the 80% plus of the people that were in school, I think it was good to have them there, as opposed to shut it down and then everyone's out.

736
00:46:40,626 --> 00:46:44,870
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd end up making it up, and I think it was a day to have, especially that week.

737
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:50,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Because remember, again, if we called off school that day, we were in school potentially Wednesday.

738
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:52,477
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a whole week would have been gone.

739
00:46:52,497 --> 00:46:54,479
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least we got a couple days in.

740
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:55,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear what you're saying.

741
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,381
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll certainly work on that.

742
00:46:56,401 --> 00:46:57,883
[SPEAKER_01]: John and I will check.

743
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:01,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Or check the rooms before students are sent to them.

744
00:47:02,326 --> 00:47:04,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was my suggestion.

745
00:47:04,607 --> 00:47:09,130
[SPEAKER_07]: If the lecture halls were not heated, maybe have them go to the cafeteria.

746
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:16,394
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll certainly have the principals review that as a practice so that they understand that, check the room out.

747
00:47:16,715 --> 00:47:18,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them in the warmest place as possible.

748
00:47:20,657 --> 00:47:21,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto, then Ms.

749
00:47:21,878 --> 00:47:22,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kleef.

750
00:47:22,783 --> 00:47:32,385
[SPEAKER_17]: So going back to the blizzard bags, this year, actually, throughout Western Mass, there are a few school districts that are piloting blizzard bags.

751
00:47:32,865 --> 00:47:42,327
[SPEAKER_17]: And with today's technology, there is a lot of online learning happening, especially for, I believe, our high school students who have AP exams.

752
00:47:42,347 --> 00:47:46,648
[SPEAKER_17]: And they take that exam no matter how many blizzard days or how many snow days we take.

753
00:47:47,228 --> 00:47:49,969
[SPEAKER_17]: They have to have so much curriculum covered by that date.

754
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:51,149
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's the date everybody

755
00:47:51,629 --> 00:47:53,190
[SPEAKER_17]: in the nation takes that test.

756
00:47:53,531 --> 00:48:04,439
[SPEAKER_17]: So by losing days for snow, we are behind kids like in Georgia and California that aren't losing that learning time and who actually might start school in August.

757
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,943
[SPEAKER_17]: They're at an advantage of some of these exams.

758
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:20,552
[SPEAKER_17]: So I believe the future in education is more electronic learning, more interactive learning, and I believe our teachers are savvy enough to teach those

759
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:21,708
[SPEAKER_17]: in that way.

760
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:26,891
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that we don't have a per child device at this point.

761
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:32,293
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that our district would love to move forward with that, but that's a very expensive thing.

762
00:48:32,613 --> 00:48:40,857
[SPEAKER_17]: But if other school districts are doing this in learning, and we can see how they're using it effectively,

763
00:48:41,197 --> 00:48:42,017
[SPEAKER_17]: for all students.

764
00:48:42,138 --> 00:48:47,960
[SPEAKER_17]: In Western Mass, there are children that are in all different socioeconomic things and they don't all have it.

765
00:48:48,361 --> 00:49:01,667
[SPEAKER_17]: We can learn from them and maybe, I brought this up a year or two ago, actually, when we did have a bad winter about two years ago when we were going late, late into June and almost into July.

766
00:49:01,687 --> 00:49:02,828
[SPEAKER_17]: It might have been three years ago.

767
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:18,424
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it is coming towards method, and we have to have an open mind with this and start looking at it and seeing what options are out there and planning for our future rather than wait and see what happens.

768
00:49:18,524 --> 00:49:19,844
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't agree.

769
00:49:19,864 --> 00:49:24,806
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that we should look forward to this, if not for this year and the next year's coming.

770
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:26,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

771
00:49:26,874 --> 00:49:27,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

772
00:49:27,374 --> 00:49:27,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

773
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:28,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Van de Kloot.

774
00:49:28,155 --> 00:49:33,519
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, I just wanted to formalize my thought then and along with Erin's.

775
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:47,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to ask that the curriculum subcommittee review the recent DESC paper on alternatives for snow days so that we can begin this discussion.

776
00:49:47,671 --> 00:49:48,852
[SPEAKER_09]: It's seconded by Mr. Giro.

777
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Tringali, would you like to speak on the matter?

778
00:49:52,435 --> 00:49:53,936
[SPEAKER_09]: You can step forward if you'd like to a mic.

779
00:49:59,315 --> 00:50:13,286
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to speak to the AP, teaching over snow days, most of the teachers already kind of take their own initiative individually as to, you know, what

780
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:19,136
[SPEAKER_03]: what sort of assignments they can give over that snow day.

781
00:50:19,396 --> 00:50:31,285
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my teachers just says, well, it's going to be three days ahead so that in the case of catastrophic blizzard, we'll still be remotely on track.

782
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:37,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And so mostly the teachers are doing this already.

783
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:48,395
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I do worry about is candidates who don't have as much accessibility to technology.

784
00:50:48,635 --> 00:50:49,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Fairness.

785
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:07,563
[SPEAKER_03]: have access to technology, and that's not something that all do, but teachers kind of work with the students already to kind of work through the simple things.

786
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:09,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to give you some sort of perspective.

787
00:51:10,164 --> 00:51:10,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to hear.

788
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:11,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

789
00:51:13,385 --> 00:51:13,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke.

790
00:51:14,745 --> 00:51:14,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

791
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:15,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Vander Kloot.

792
00:51:15,645 --> 00:51:25,148
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to congratulate our representative from the high school, Sebastian Tringali, on his recent acceptance to Tufts University.

793
00:51:31,973 --> 00:51:32,473
[SPEAKER_09]: and drags.

794
00:51:32,493 --> 00:51:34,775
[SPEAKER_13]: It means he'll be nice and close.

795
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:36,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

796
00:51:36,976 --> 00:51:37,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Ruggiero?

797
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:38,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you blinking?

798
00:51:38,857 --> 00:51:38,897
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

799
00:51:38,917 --> 00:51:39,678
[SPEAKER_09]: My motion is second.

800
00:51:41,038 --> 00:51:42,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Second the motion by Ms.

801
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:54,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloot that this paper be sent to the curriculum subcommittee to investigate the DESE findings on alternative ways of conducting school business on snow days or emergency days off.

802
00:51:55,367 --> 00:51:56,228
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

803
00:51:56,288 --> 00:51:56,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

804
00:51:57,568 --> 00:51:58,469
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

805
00:51:59,149 --> 00:51:59,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

806
00:52:04,227 --> 00:52:13,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Item six, recommendation to adopt oversight guidelines for PTO slash PTG and other 501c3 organizations that support our public schools.

807
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:18,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor and members of the school committee, we had an extensive discussion in the committee of the whole.

808
00:52:18,913 --> 00:52:23,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, just to briefly summarize it,

809
00:52:25,737 --> 00:52:29,440
[SPEAKER_01]: The organizations that exist to support our schools are all good people.

810
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,420
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working hard.

811
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:32,321
[SPEAKER_01]: They give up a lot of their time.

812
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:34,303
[SPEAKER_01]: They generate a lot of support for our schools.

813
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:36,164
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very grateful and thankful.

814
00:52:37,025 --> 00:52:55,017
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in order to optimize it, in order to make it more efficient and more effective overall across the city, and in order to tie it together with our own work, it's important for us to adopt some guidelines, adopt some training protocols, so that we can help these organizations do that much better.

815
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:57,458
[SPEAKER_01]: and to dovetail much better with us.

816
00:52:57,518 --> 00:53:07,944
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've put together for you some recommendations to adopt oversight guidelines for PTOs, PTGs, and other 501c3 internal organizations.

817
00:53:08,324 --> 00:53:16,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say internal organizations because I'm not talking about if a major corporation's 501c3 gives us money, I'm not going to ask them to audit their books.

818
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:22,852
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm talking about groups that technically work with us or use our name.

819
00:53:23,472 --> 00:53:23,853
[SPEAKER_01]: So if

820
00:53:24,713 --> 00:53:26,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Bloomberg gives us some money.

821
00:53:26,514 --> 00:53:28,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to ask him for his financials this week.

822
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:30,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess he probably wouldn't send them to me anyway.

823
00:53:31,558 --> 00:53:38,823
[SPEAKER_01]: But having said that, our Cummings Foundation, things like that, they give us money and I'm appreciative that they do.

824
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:41,965
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm talking about the internal groups that are clearly ours.

825
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:48,204
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've listed eight items and I would ask that you approve them.

826
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I can read them off or you can accept them as they're written.

827
00:53:52,808 --> 00:53:54,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you're... Would you like me to read them?

828
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:55,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

829
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like me to read them?

830
00:53:57,011 --> 00:53:57,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to you.

831
00:53:57,532 --> 00:53:57,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I can read them.

832
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:09,399
[SPEAKER_01]: One, all PTG, PTOs, and other internal 501c3 organizations affiliated with the Medford Public Schools must be registered with the superintendent's office annually.

833
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,662
[SPEAKER_01]: All registrations must be renewed by September 1st of each year.

834
00:54:14,282 --> 00:54:27,609
[SPEAKER_01]: A registration is simply a process of recognizing that an organization exists, and if they're out in the street, that there's a number they can have, and if a person who's a member of the community wants to donate, they know this is a valid organization.

835
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:33,470
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also know that they exist, and they're using our name and raising money using our name.

836
00:54:34,391 --> 00:54:36,011
[SPEAKER_01]: To all registered organizations.

837
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:36,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

838
00:54:36,971 --> 00:54:37,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone.

839
00:54:39,052 --> 00:54:41,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it the same number every year for the PTO?

840
00:54:42,053 --> 00:54:43,653
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the federal ID number?

841
00:54:44,213 --> 00:54:44,953
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't change.

842
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:46,414
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't change.

843
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:49,675
[SPEAKER_09]: This would be an internal registration.

844
00:54:50,095 --> 00:54:52,075
[SPEAKER_01]: MPS 1234, whatever it is.

845
00:54:52,195 --> 00:54:52,455
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

846
00:54:52,795 --> 00:54:55,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just curious what the registration form you have.

847
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:58,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a very simple thing, but I want to know they exist.

848
00:54:59,272 --> 00:54:59,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Who they are.

849
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:01,254
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it as it comes down.

850
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it'll come down.

851
00:55:03,395 --> 00:55:03,796
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it.

852
00:55:03,956 --> 00:55:05,637
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see the things that will be on the form.

853
00:55:06,378 --> 00:55:09,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Who the officers are, and so on and so forth.

854
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:12,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they're banking, and the likes of this.

855
00:55:12,524 --> 00:55:13,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Just let me continue.

856
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:15,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it will flush out, and then there could be questions at the end.

857
00:55:17,165 --> 00:55:26,008
[SPEAKER_01]: All registered organizations must submit bylaws, names of officers and board members, annual fundraising and expenditure plans, and a year-end financial statement.

858
00:55:26,788 --> 00:55:29,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we want to know that every organization has some rules.

859
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:34,150
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to know that they have a plan, that it's not just something.

860
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:36,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if they want to modify it, they can let us know they want to modify it.

861
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:41,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not running around trying to second guess every move, but they should have a plan.

862
00:55:42,293 --> 00:55:46,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And another reason for that is the fact that if everyone hits the same bank,

863
00:55:46,907 --> 00:55:50,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone hits the same business over and over again.

864
00:55:51,153 --> 00:55:53,356
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on our community pretty hard.

865
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:57,721
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, when the school department goes to them for various things, they might say, but I already gave.

866
00:55:58,442 --> 00:55:59,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important for us to know who

867
00:56:01,543 --> 00:56:14,552
[SPEAKER_01]: is being asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for services, and whether or not it interferes with something that might be a larger project that the school department might be able to do for the greater benefit of all.

868
00:56:14,932 --> 00:56:21,757
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could just interject, I just asked you guys not to, but you don't know who you're going to go to at the beginning of your year.

869
00:56:21,777 --> 00:56:22,758
[SPEAKER_09]: You have an idea.

870
00:56:22,778 --> 00:56:24,539
[SPEAKER_09]: That happens over the course of the year.

871
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,921
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you generally don't know.

872
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:33,416
[SPEAKER_09]: You hit everybody, sometimes you focus on one, but it's dependent upon what you're trying to accomplish.

873
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:34,236
[SPEAKER_01]: You can modify it.

874
00:56:34,596 --> 00:56:36,657
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make changes.

875
00:56:37,037 --> 00:56:37,818
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a projection.

876
00:56:38,258 --> 00:56:39,118
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like our budget.

877
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:41,759
[SPEAKER_01]: We project certain things and changes happen during the year.

878
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,120
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just nature.

879
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,862
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just send in a note, say we did something different or we added something.

880
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:48,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it doesn't have to be that tight.

881
00:56:49,483 --> 00:56:51,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me keep going and then we can hit it all.

882
00:56:51,364 --> 00:56:53,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these things intersect with each other.

883
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:02,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, bylaws must clearly identify how a person becomes eligible for membership and how a person becomes a voting member.

884
00:57:02,944 --> 00:57:03,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Distinct difference.

885
00:57:03,945 --> 00:57:15,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a person comes to a meeting, they may be a member, but if they've been to one meeting in three years, do they have the right to make decisions for a group of people that have been working on it for an extended period of time?

886
00:57:16,972 --> 00:57:18,313
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a decision people can make.

887
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:24,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Bylaws must identify what is a voting quorum.

888
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:28,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them, three people in the room could be a voting quorum.

889
00:57:28,588 --> 00:57:29,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a voting quorum?

890
00:57:29,888 --> 00:57:32,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have to have so many members of the executive board to be a voting quorum?

891
00:57:32,788 --> 00:57:37,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have to have so many members of the established membership to make a major decision?

892
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:44,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Bylaws must provide detailed information how, when elections for officers and board members will be implemented.

893
00:57:45,231 --> 00:57:46,211
[SPEAKER_01]: When is it going to happen?

894
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:47,811
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the process?

895
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:52,792
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the distribution of information so that people know that an election is coming?

896
00:57:54,201 --> 00:58:04,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Expenditures of funds must be done in coordination with the principal to ensure that supported programs, activities, and materials are consistent with the school's program and do not distract from the main mission of the school.

897
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:11,726
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't have an organization decide to buy a new curriculum that is counter-indicative to the ones the school system has adopted.

898
00:58:12,246 --> 00:58:16,868
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't have people planning trips that get in the way of testing or planning trips that

899
00:58:18,393 --> 00:58:20,793
[SPEAKER_01]: come just as the testing season's about to begin.

900
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:26,574
[SPEAKER_01]: We're planning trips that are not tied to the curriculum in an important way.

901
00:58:26,995 --> 00:58:28,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe once in a while, but not all the time.

902
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, we only have 180 days of school.

903
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:32,956
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure all of them are used properly.

904
00:58:36,896 --> 00:58:40,477
[SPEAKER_01]: The public schools through the superintendents offer training to each entity.

905
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:45,398
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure they all know what forms they have to fill out, if they're raising funds, if they're a non-profit.

906
00:58:46,993 --> 00:58:50,715
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them to understand regulations and ordinances, what they can do.

907
00:58:51,176 --> 00:58:55,799
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pay somebody money, and you pay them a certain amount of money, guess what?

908
00:58:56,579 --> 00:59:00,362
[SPEAKER_01]: You've gotta give them a form where technically you're paying them under the table.

909
00:59:00,842 --> 00:59:01,622
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not acceptable.

910
00:59:02,603 --> 00:59:06,706
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're giving people money as reimbursement, reimbursement for what?

911
00:59:06,806 --> 00:59:08,367
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you requiring?

912
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:11,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, tonight you asked about slips and things like that.

913
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:14,391
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all heavily documented when it comes through the school system.

914
00:59:14,971 --> 00:59:16,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we documenting these things?

915
00:59:17,247 --> 00:59:19,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Gives us an idea of those things.

916
00:59:20,148 --> 00:59:29,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And if a person doesn't participate and doesn't become these things, then we maybe decertify them and say, look, we're not going to register you.

917
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:34,333
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be an allowable organization because we can't track what you're doing.

918
00:59:34,913 --> 00:59:39,015
[SPEAKER_01]: And then an annual report should be made to the school committee about all the organizations that exist.

919
00:59:39,983 --> 00:59:56,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And the general thing, there may not be every expenditure they have, but it certainly should give you an idea of what started the year, what ended the year, and the main activities and the like that they had, and if they had an election, did they change officers, if there were special circumstances, was it reported.

920
00:59:56,822 --> 01:00:01,104
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we do something like that, we'll have helped these organizations be that much better.

921
01:00:01,964 --> 01:00:07,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll help ourselves as we try to coordinate their activities with our initiatives as well.

922
01:00:08,307 --> 01:00:10,568
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the floor is open for discussion.

923
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:12,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto?

924
01:00:13,049 --> 01:00:13,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

925
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:15,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for this.

926
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,231
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's a good place to start.

927
01:00:20,352 --> 01:00:26,475
[SPEAKER_17]: So in the title of it, recommendation to adopt oversight guidelines for PTO and PTG.

928
01:00:27,045 --> 01:00:39,157
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like to have friends of as well listed, not as under other, but directly PTO, PTG and friends of groups.

929
01:00:39,777 --> 01:00:49,607
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I just want them to realize that they are included in part of this and the oversight will also include them.

930
01:00:50,126 --> 01:00:52,247
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would like to add a number nine.

931
01:00:53,287 --> 01:01:02,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Register any event that uses our building through community schools so we can track how much our schools are being used and which schools are being used the most.

932
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:12,574
[SPEAKER_17]: So that way we can allocate funding for maintenance and repairs and custodial services and extra paper towels and toilet paper to those buildings.

933
01:01:13,195 --> 01:01:16,096
[SPEAKER_17]: And extra cleaning if that's necessary.

934
01:01:16,436 --> 01:01:19,077
[SPEAKER_17]: And to track where in the city we're using a lot.

935
01:01:20,712 --> 01:01:34,815
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe we need to move it to another side of town so other people in the community can go that don't drive or have an opportunity to attend different things, especially if it's a big event.

936
01:01:35,535 --> 01:01:35,855
[SPEAKER_17]: OK?

937
01:01:36,335 --> 01:01:38,716
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are the type of things I'd like to see added.

938
01:01:38,756 --> 01:01:39,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

939
01:01:41,096 --> 01:01:41,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Rousseau.

940
01:01:42,957 --> 01:01:43,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

941
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:52,945
[SPEAKER_04]: The response I got from some PTO members when they saw this was interesting.

942
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,647
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sort of like, well, that's it, I'm done.

943
01:01:56,727 --> 01:01:58,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty much... I'm sorry, you didn't hear that?

944
01:01:58,709 --> 01:01:59,569
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, I'm done.

945
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not doing the PTO anymore.

946
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:08,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of this seems to be solving a problem that doesn't exist.

947
01:02:08,636 --> 01:02:14,020
[SPEAKER_04]: The financial aspects about having some kind of a reporting on the finances makes perfect

948
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:31,704
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the voting stuff, you know, I know of a PTO that nobody can remember having an election because there has never been enough people to show up to fill all the spots in the six years that they've been participating.

949
01:02:32,504 --> 01:02:41,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's fine to say we should have elections, but when you have three people, four people, or five people filling the six spots year after year,

950
01:02:42,297 --> 01:02:58,100
[SPEAKER_04]: adding one more thing where they have to post that there's going to be an election, print it, get it distributed to all of the families, have an actual meeting so that the three or four of them can come together with their cookies and say, I guess it's us again, but don't forget to take a roll call.

951
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:03,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of effort doesn't seem like that big a deal.

952
01:03:04,022 --> 01:03:10,883
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you add things like the training, so if it's going to be the same treasurer for seven years in a row,

953
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:17,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to make them go to training seven years in a row or we decertify that organization?

954
01:03:18,976 --> 01:03:22,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we can certainly do that.

955
01:03:23,862 --> 01:03:28,525
[SPEAKER_04]: going to have a lot of trouble finding any treasurers.

956
01:03:30,947 --> 01:03:34,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're looking at people who don't have experience.

957
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:39,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, if a person's been doing it and doing it successfully, you don't have to go to things.

958
01:03:40,034 --> 01:03:43,836
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have our teachers take courses that they've already passed and know.

959
01:03:44,397 --> 01:03:45,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's a refresher.

960
01:03:45,998 --> 01:03:47,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's new rules.

961
01:03:47,999 --> 01:03:51,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's new forms that need to be filed.

962
01:03:51,882 --> 01:03:52,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's changes.

963
01:03:53,764 --> 01:03:54,344
[SPEAKER_01]: That may work.

964
01:03:55,065 --> 01:04:04,349
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the governance structure goes and elections, if there's no one running, you just simply certify it through the principal's office that we only have so many people.

965
01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:16,034
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got to let people know because, I mean, one of the complaints that we heard, rightly or wrongly, I'm not taking sides on this thing, was that people didn't know how you become an officer or how you participate.

966
01:04:16,735 --> 01:04:20,456
[SPEAKER_01]: And theoretically, under the school councils, you're supposed to have that election every year.

967
01:04:21,117 --> 01:04:21,897
[SPEAKER_01]: It's required.

968
01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:23,870
[SPEAKER_01]: by the statute.

969
01:04:24,491 --> 01:04:27,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know it doesn't always happen 100%, but it should.

970
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:28,815
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

971
01:04:28,835 --> 01:04:39,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least there should be some declaration that the only people that applied for these offices or want to do it are a handful of people, but after a reasonable attempt.

972
01:04:40,507 --> 01:04:44,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got to do that, or else people say, well, I'm not involved.

973
01:04:44,271 --> 01:04:45,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get involved.

974
01:04:45,272 --> 01:04:46,193
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't consult me.

975
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's part of the discussion?

976
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people consulted?

977
01:04:49,245 --> 01:04:50,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have a chance to participate?

978
01:04:51,447 --> 01:04:56,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one of the issues I think you raised during the campaign was community engagement.

979
01:04:56,410 --> 01:05:00,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, does the PTO engage the community that it represents?

980
01:05:00,494 --> 01:05:00,834
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

981
01:05:01,414 --> 01:05:03,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a balance there.

982
01:05:03,356 --> 01:05:14,705
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we have to make it into a very rigorous process, but I do think there should be some notification that there are officers available, there are board positions available.

983
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:15,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to participate?

984
01:05:17,298 --> 01:05:17,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a thought.

985
01:05:18,438 --> 01:05:19,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I continue?

986
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:29,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think the sort of slightly off that topic, the issue of other 501c3s, I mean, I think about like the Medford Education Foundation.

987
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:33,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they are about Medford public schools.

988
01:05:34,641 --> 01:05:38,662
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like Friends of Baseball, Friends of Rowing, Friends of that do a lot of things.

989
01:05:38,822 --> 01:05:40,903
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't want the MEF to have to go through this.

990
01:05:41,863 --> 01:05:42,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do we?

991
01:05:44,852 --> 01:05:47,493
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using the city of Medford's public schools name.

992
01:05:47,513 --> 01:05:47,873
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.

993
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:48,473
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

994
01:05:48,953 --> 01:05:58,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of gets back to my very first kind of question they didn't ask yet was, so the PTOs were not consulted for this, correct?

995
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:01,357
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we haven't done a wide sweep on that.

996
01:06:02,217 --> 01:06:10,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, I just feel like that this should at least, that they should be part of the conversation on what would work.

997
01:06:11,025 --> 01:06:19,128
[SPEAKER_09]: You can make a motion that this be tabled, pending, or send to a subcommittee if you... I'd like to make a motion that this be sent to the... Is it the rules subcommittee?

998
01:06:20,348 --> 01:06:25,470
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be rules.

999
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:32,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on support services, so I would certainly be happy to send it there, if that's okay.

1000
01:06:35,108 --> 01:06:36,388
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your motion.

1001
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:40,210
[SPEAKER_04]: At this, I'd like to make a motion to send this to support services to create a form.

1002
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:43,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the appropriate subcommittee?

1003
01:06:43,131 --> 01:06:46,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, you know, let's, let's understand what these subcommittees are supposed to do.

1004
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:50,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Support services deals primarily with services that support the educational program.

1005
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,695
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more rules of, this is more of the rules of the operation.

1006
01:06:56,015 --> 01:07:04,098
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm just, you know, I'm just trying to clarify for you because I mean, if you want to keep some integrity to your subcommittee assignments, you can do what you want.

1007
01:07:06,181 --> 01:07:08,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to make a motion to send this to the Rules Subcommittee.

1008
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,924
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, as seconded by Ms.

1009
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Vander Kloot, did you also wish to comment prior to calling?

1010
01:07:13,365 --> 01:07:14,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I did.

1011
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:14,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1012
01:07:14,485 --> 01:07:15,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Vander Kloot.

1013
01:07:15,366 --> 01:07:26,872
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have first, the first thing I wanted to suggest or say that it also included all of those booster clubs or athletic support groups as well.

1014
01:07:28,853 --> 01:07:32,895
[SPEAKER_13]: I think September 1st is a bad day to pick because it's, you know,

1015
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:40,656
[SPEAKER_13]: off on Labor Day weekend, I think it would make more sense to change it to September 15th or September 30th.

1016
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:49,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand that you're in financial support, saying the relative wealth of where they stand.

1017
01:07:49,683 --> 01:07:57,390
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I get really uncomfortable, and you and I have had this discussion many times, when you start wanting to sound like, Mr. Superintendent,

1018
01:07:57,752 --> 01:08:00,774
[SPEAKER_13]: micromanage who's going to go to what bank and whatever.

1019
01:08:00,795 --> 01:08:01,635
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't do that.

1020
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:03,917
[SPEAKER_13]: We just can't do that.

1021
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:04,838
[SPEAKER_13]: We understand.

1022
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:10,202
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you were seeing all of them and you wanted to draw people together and have a discussion, that's be one thing.

1023
01:08:10,562 --> 01:08:22,392
[SPEAKER_13]: But I get really uncomfortable with the thought that you're going to tell the Medford Educational Foundation, of which I belong, or a McGlynn PTO member or Columbus whatever,

1024
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:26,171
[SPEAKER_13]: that, well, they can't have that fundraiser because somebody else is doing it.

1025
01:08:26,611 --> 01:08:32,133
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to put that out there and say, makes me real nervous when you went down that path.

1026
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:34,074
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think it's appropriate.

1027
01:08:35,214 --> 01:08:42,817
[SPEAKER_13]: I think when you get to number six, expenditures of funds must be done in coordination with the principal slash administration or whatever.

1028
01:08:42,857 --> 01:08:46,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, for instance, the Medford Educational Foundation, we don't

1029
01:08:47,712 --> 01:08:55,613
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a principal sign-off sheet, however, we've been known to work closely with administration to make sure.

1030
01:08:56,170 --> 01:09:00,292
[SPEAKER_13]: that we are, in fact, not funding a program that would not be appropriate.

1031
01:09:00,672 --> 01:09:07,114
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I spoke up before, I do believe that the Educational Foundation would, in fact, benefit from something.

1032
01:09:07,274 --> 01:09:14,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we are a 501c3, and I think everybody who is a 501c this, you are required to have bylaws.

1033
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:16,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, how formally you play them out is another thing.

1034
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:21,139
[SPEAKER_13]: But somewhere in your organization, at some point, you have had bylaws, because if you're a 501c3,

1035
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,600
[SPEAKER_13]: You needed to have that.

1036
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:29,202
[SPEAKER_13]: You needed to specify how the offices worked.

1037
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:38,004
[SPEAKER_13]: So even though, Paul, I understand what you're saying and your concerns, some of that actually is called for by the nonprofit status.

1038
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:43,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, otherwise than that, I think that we can send it off.

1039
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,266
[SPEAKER_13]: But those were some of my initial concerns.

1040
01:09:46,086 --> 01:09:46,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1041
01:09:46,467 --> 01:09:47,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Ruggiero?

1042
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:51,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent, for putting this forward.

1043
01:09:52,322 --> 01:10:00,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to, seeing that we're sending this to subcommittee, I just want to add another item that we draft material that can be used to help these groups, maybe like a sample bylaws.

1044
01:10:01,204 --> 01:10:04,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be set up, not that anyone has to follow them, but just like a template.

1045
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:13,807
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a recommended set of best practices that we could put, maybe a binder, that we could put together for different PTOs, just to help them have the best process possible.

1046
01:10:15,902 --> 01:10:18,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm just making, we're adding items on the list, right?

1047
01:10:18,843 --> 01:10:19,464
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at nine, so.

1048
01:10:20,244 --> 01:10:22,765
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could just, from the chair, item two.

1049
01:10:23,305 --> 01:10:25,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it goes back to your question, Ms.

1050
01:10:25,686 --> 01:10:26,147
[SPEAKER_09]: VanderBloom.

1051
01:10:26,727 --> 01:10:35,431
[SPEAKER_09]: All registered organizations must submit bylaws, names of officers and board members, and then it says annual fundraising and expenditure plans, if that could just be an annual budget.

1052
01:10:37,832 --> 01:10:39,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the end,

1053
01:10:40,849 --> 01:10:44,612
[SPEAKER_09]: in a year-end financial statement, including the Form 990 and state filings.

1054
01:10:45,573 --> 01:10:46,634
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to do it to be a 990.

1055
01:10:47,134 --> 01:10:51,678
[SPEAKER_09]: To be a 501c3, you have to file with the state, and you also have to file with the IRS.

1056
01:10:52,218 --> 01:10:53,519
[SPEAKER_09]: So why not make it part of the package?

1057
01:10:53,559 --> 01:10:55,201
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the year, they submit it to us.

1058
01:10:55,241 --> 01:10:59,464
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have everything's copacetic as far as filings.

1059
01:11:00,986 --> 01:11:05,689
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could send this document as amended to the Rules Committee, which Ms.

1060
01:11:05,749 --> 01:11:07,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Kretz will chair this year.

1061
01:11:08,228 --> 01:11:09,629
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a second on the floor by Ms.

1062
01:11:09,649 --> 01:11:10,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloot.

1063
01:11:10,469 --> 01:11:11,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by Mr. Russo.

1064
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:12,971
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1065
01:11:12,991 --> 01:11:13,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1066
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:14,652
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1067
01:11:15,252 --> 01:11:15,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion has it.

1068
01:11:16,053 --> 01:11:18,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want me to list the amendments that were discussed just now?

1069
01:11:18,914 --> 01:11:18,954
No.

1070
01:11:20,515 --> 01:11:21,196
[SPEAKER_09]: You're all good with it?

1071
01:11:21,296 --> 01:11:21,356
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1072
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:26,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we get it from the minutes, and then we'll move it over.

1073
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:28,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1074
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:28,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloot.

1075
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Before you move on, though, I do know that there are members of the

1076
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:50,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any PTGs out there that would like to speak on this topic?

1077
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly, if you'd like to step forward.

1078
01:12:00,062 --> 01:12:01,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Your name and address, please, for our record.

1079
01:12:02,414 --> 01:12:04,796
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Louis Perdomo, I live at 44 Washington Street.

1080
01:12:07,398 --> 01:12:11,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on your comment, I'm sorry, I can't see your name.

1081
01:12:11,182 --> 01:12:11,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Russo.

1082
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:23,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Russo, on your comment on the sort of three, when there's three members at a time, and they're always there at all times, and usually nobody else joins, it's usually those three people.

1083
01:12:24,292 --> 01:12:28,396
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with that is that they're not engaged in the community.

1084
01:12:29,056 --> 01:12:34,980
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's three people all the time, that means those three people are not doing whatever they're volunteered for.

1085
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,003
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not, in a sense, engaging the community.

1086
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:45,047
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the sense of looking for that, when you see just three people there all the time and nothing is being done,

1087
01:12:45,957 --> 01:12:48,680
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you sort of say, okay, what are you guys really doing?

1088
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:53,064
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of for the comment that you were saying is like, why these people need the training or another stuff?

1089
01:12:53,565 --> 01:13:01,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe they do need training to actually address those deficiencies that, that, yeah, they're not engaging.

1090
01:13:01,193 --> 01:13:06,478
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not talking there because I've been a parent from the McGlynn school and I

1091
01:13:08,087 --> 01:13:15,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot recall the one time that somebody from the PTG approached me and said, hey, listen, you're a parent.

1092
01:13:16,373 --> 01:13:17,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to join this organization?

1093
01:13:18,555 --> 01:13:20,517
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm sort of saying this now.

1094
01:13:21,057 --> 01:13:21,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1095
01:13:21,357 --> 01:13:23,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1096
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:27,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone else that would like to speak?

1097
01:13:31,348 --> 01:13:33,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez again, 281 Park Street.

1098
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:36,950
[SPEAKER_15]: I am an active member of my PTO.

1099
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:42,672
[SPEAKER_15]: No one personally approached me, but I can tell you that my PTO sends constant flyers.

1100
01:13:43,412 --> 01:13:45,533
[SPEAKER_15]: They have events almost monthly.

1101
01:13:45,653 --> 01:13:46,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Every PTO does this.

1102
01:13:47,073 --> 01:13:48,674
[SPEAKER_15]: We have Facebook pages.

1103
01:13:49,034 --> 01:13:50,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of us have Twitter accounts.

1104
01:13:51,415 --> 01:13:53,816
[SPEAKER_15]: We make every effort to have people join.

1105
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:55,576
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not a board member on a PTO.

1106
01:13:55,757 --> 01:13:59,878
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to a PTO meeting and I raised my hand and volunteered.

1107
01:14:00,568 --> 01:14:06,777
[SPEAKER_15]: I've added programming to my PTO on a voluntary basis, and people do the best that they can.

1108
01:14:07,358 --> 01:14:16,872
[SPEAKER_15]: I've gone to meetings where there's been three people, and I know for a fact that a flyer's gone out, that a flyer's been on the window at the school, that we've posted it on our Facebook page.

1109
01:14:17,406 --> 01:14:18,507
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's three people there.

1110
01:14:19,107 --> 01:14:24,709
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's not because we're not engaging our community, because we have signs up at every event that things are going on.

1111
01:14:24,849 --> 01:14:25,850
[SPEAKER_15]: We send out emails.

1112
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:29,551
[SPEAKER_15]: There's only so much that you can do, but you have to be realistic.

1113
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:34,013
[SPEAKER_15]: When I had my first child, I worked full time, and I did not volunteer at the PTO.

1114
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,714
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not have the time or the bandwidth.

1115
01:14:36,134 --> 01:14:38,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm lucky now that I can and I do.

1116
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:42,497
[SPEAKER_15]: And I appreciate that a lot of people are not able to do that, and I don't think

1117
01:14:43,157 --> 01:14:47,361
[SPEAKER_15]: that we should be disparaging people on either side, people that do have the time to volunteer, great.

1118
01:14:47,681 --> 01:14:50,083
[SPEAKER_15]: People that don't, you know, that's fine too.

1119
01:14:50,363 --> 01:14:51,844
[SPEAKER_15]: We're here for all of the children.

1120
01:14:51,944 --> 01:14:53,906
[SPEAKER_15]: We do fundraising for every child.

1121
01:14:54,666 --> 01:15:00,328
[SPEAKER_15]: in all the schools, and we're not singling out and go, oh, Johnny's mother didn't help, so he doesn't get a t-shirt on field day.

1122
01:15:00,608 --> 01:15:02,029
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think we need to remember that.

1123
01:15:02,469 --> 01:15:23,517
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope that some of your recommendations will include ways to help some of our PTOs, especially those of us that are in high needs districts, high needs areas, where our parents do work two jobs, or our parents don't speak English, or they have special needs children they have to attend to, or they have three or four children, and packing those kids up and coming to a PTO meeting is impossible.

1124
01:15:23,857 --> 01:15:26,318
[SPEAKER_15]: We even tried to do our meetings on Facebook Live.

1125
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:29,678
[SPEAKER_15]: And it didn't increase our attendance.

1126
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,859
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're all doing the best that we can.

1127
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:34,959
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope that the district is able to help us.

1128
01:15:35,019 --> 01:15:45,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Because from year to year, some PTOs find that it's really hard for them to afford that $8,000 to $10,000 that we need for the buses, or that field day event, or that in-school enrichment.

1129
01:15:45,623 --> 01:15:47,003
[SPEAKER_15]: And we do the best that we can.

1130
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:50,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes you run a fundraiser, and you think you're going to make $1,000, and you make $500.

1131
01:15:50,804 --> 01:15:56,506
[SPEAKER_15]: And you have to add another fundraiser on the fly, because you're not going to cover those bills at the end of the year.

1132
01:15:57,401 --> 01:15:57,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1133
01:15:59,544 --> 01:15:59,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1134
01:15:59,724 --> 01:16:00,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Van de Kloot.

1135
01:16:00,865 --> 01:16:16,924
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be a shame if this conversation ended with any thought that we're not appreciative of the extraordinarily hard work of our PTOs, PTGs, booster clubs, and any other organization that gives up their time and effort to

1136
01:16:17,995 --> 01:16:19,576
[SPEAKER_13]: raise money for our students.

1137
01:16:20,396 --> 01:16:38,103
[SPEAKER_13]: I know from experience, I know from my time on the school committee and before that, how hard people work and how often it is a very small group of people in the end who really bust their butt night after night making sure that all of the

1138
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:41,250
[SPEAKER_13]: money is raised that the kids get the opportunities.

1139
01:16:41,711 --> 01:16:43,792
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I just think that it's really important.

1140
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:49,995
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, many of you won't remember this and the only two maybe in the room right now might be the superintendent and

1141
01:16:50,476 --> 01:16:59,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Diane Caldwell, remember that before I was on the school committee, one of the things that I did was an event called It's Your Night to Shine.

1142
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:15,184
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was a thank you to all the volunteers, all the PTO members who busted their butts, because way back then, as someone who was just beginning in all of this, it was so clear to me that there were a few people who just kept things going.

1143
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:16,965
[SPEAKER_13]: And they were all, blessedly,

1144
01:17:17,358 --> 01:17:23,142
[SPEAKER_13]: that it's always somehow worked out that we have a group of parents at each and every school who will take this.

1145
01:17:23,302 --> 01:17:28,065
[SPEAKER_13]: And sometimes it's because the void, they see that no one else is there and they step in and they make it happen.

1146
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:46,316
[SPEAKER_13]: So within all of this and this discussion, by putting in something like this, ultimately the desire is not to just oversee and enforce and say you have to do one more thing, but to be helpful, to be positive, and always to say thank you so much for the work that you do.

1147
01:17:48,675 --> 01:17:49,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

1148
01:17:50,396 --> 01:17:51,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto on this topic.

1149
01:17:51,938 --> 01:17:52,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1150
01:17:52,358 --> 01:17:52,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1151
01:17:53,599 --> 01:17:59,384
[SPEAKER_17]: So on our agenda on the back page, there's a listing of reports that we've asked for.

1152
01:17:59,524 --> 01:18:07,330
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you look under requested reports, the first one was a report on PTOs, including how they're helping the community and what they are working on.

1153
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:09,652
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was requested last April, April of 2017.

1154
01:18:11,642 --> 01:18:25,006
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, it needs to be amended because when we spoke at our committee meeting recently, the superintendent said that he is planning to have all the PTOs come before the school committee between the month of April and May.

1155
01:18:25,066 --> 01:18:29,588
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would like that amended, that line item.

1156
01:18:30,988 --> 01:18:38,391
[SPEAKER_17]: And the goal that I had when I requested that last April was to bring the PTOs forward to

1157
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:51,261
[SPEAKER_17]: celebrate the things that they have done for the school district, and to bring them forward so the rest of the community knows, like, hey, at the McGlynn, this is some of the things they've run, and they've run it for 10 years, and the kids still love it.

1158
01:18:51,401 --> 01:19:00,083
[SPEAKER_17]: Or, you know, second graders get to go to the science museum, and the PTOs throughout the district have paid for the buses.

1159
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:02,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's celebrate some of these things.

1160
01:19:02,083 --> 01:19:05,184
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was my goal back in April, because I just felt like,

1161
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,462
[SPEAKER_17]: less, people have less time to do that.

1162
01:19:08,762 --> 01:19:14,887
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're so involved with trying to get by and things are a little harder for families now or they're busier.

1163
01:19:14,907 --> 01:19:20,812
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was just a way to bring them in to celebrate the work and the time and the effort they did.

1164
01:19:22,053 --> 01:19:25,576
[SPEAKER_17]: My history has been started as a PTO

1165
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:30,761
[SPEAKER_17]: president, co-president with Ian Ricucci, who is amazing.

1166
01:19:31,262 --> 01:19:34,612
[SPEAKER_17]: And I had a big mouth then, and I wasn't ready to be quiet.

1167
01:19:34,632 --> 01:19:36,457
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why I ran for school committee.

1168
01:19:36,853 --> 01:19:45,918
[SPEAKER_17]: and I'm here in front of you now, and didn't run till my youngest graduated, because I felt like I had a big voice as a parent, and you all have a big voice, everybody has a voice.

1169
01:19:46,218 --> 01:20:03,646
[SPEAKER_17]: Show up at these meetings, say what you need to say, ask us for what you need and what your children need, that's what we're here for, and we need to celebrate the people who have volunteered, have done so much already, and before we ask them to do more, we need to show them that we do care and we are here to help support you.

1170
01:20:05,727 --> 01:20:13,373
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to applaud the people here tonight and encourage more people in the community to come forward and ask the superintendent to amend that piece.

1171
01:20:14,113 --> 01:20:19,637
[SPEAKER_17]: So that way, we do have the PTOs come in April and May of 2018.

1172
01:20:20,118 --> 01:20:28,724
[SPEAKER_17]: And we should invite the press so that they get a list of all the wonderful things that have been happening, not only this year, but years past as well.

1173
01:20:28,804 --> 01:20:32,307
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's time to celebrate some of the happenings in our community.

1174
01:20:32,687 --> 01:20:34,709
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's my request, Madam Mayor.

1175
01:20:34,749 --> 01:20:35,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1176
01:20:35,923 --> 01:20:36,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1177
01:20:37,104 --> 01:20:37,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1178
01:20:37,304 --> 01:20:37,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Wright?

1179
01:20:41,745 --> 01:20:44,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and school committee.

1180
01:20:44,987 --> 01:20:47,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Jane Wright, treasurer of the McGlynn Elementary PTG.

1181
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:58,572
[SPEAKER_11]: I was not planning on speaking tonight after last Tuesday's school committee meeting when Superintendent Belson reported there was no malfeasance found in the finances of the McGlynn Elementary PTG.

1182
01:20:59,613 --> 01:21:04,235
[SPEAKER_11]: However, Mr. Ruggiero continues to perpetrate lies and misunderstandings on social media.

1183
01:21:05,693 --> 01:21:13,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I had anticipated after last week's meetings that there would be an effort to move forward with Superintendent Belson's recommendations, as reported out in his findings.

1184
01:21:14,681 --> 01:21:15,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I look forward to that effort.

1185
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:26,272
[SPEAKER_11]: However, it seems that Mr. Ruggiero feels compelled to continue waging an assault on my integrity and the PTG, notwithstanding the superintendent's findings and recommendations.

1186
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:36,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Last Friday night, Mr. Ruggieri wrote on Facebook how going to the press was, I quote, a hard choice on how to alert the public to lost donation money.

1187
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:44,247
[SPEAKER_11]: There was no lost donation money, for if there was, it would have been reported in the investigation into the finances.

1188
01:21:45,623 --> 01:21:52,187
[SPEAKER_11]: At last Tuesday's meeting, I refuted Mr. Agero's numerous quotes on how he tried to contact me many times over the course of a month.

1189
01:21:52,967 --> 01:21:59,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I produced my cell phone records from October 1st, 2017 until January 13th, 2018.

1190
01:22:00,131 --> 01:22:03,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Agero called me once on December 14th.

1191
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:11,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Still, as he posted last Friday night, he is continuing to claim he made numerous calls, now texts, and Facebook messages.

1192
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I received one call from Mr. Agero

1193
01:22:15,522 --> 01:22:22,146
[SPEAKER_11]: on December 14th, and no other attempts were made by Mr. Agero to contact me or anyone else on the board.

1194
01:22:24,447 --> 01:22:36,613
[SPEAKER_11]: On the phone, Mr. Agero did not speak with me in a strong way, nor did he say that he had financial concerns that he needed to talk with me about regarding the PTG, as he asserted in one of his recent posts.

1195
01:22:37,674 --> 01:22:45,158
[SPEAKER_11]: As I said at last week's meeting, if I knew people were questioning the finances, I would have met with them that night, and I would not be here again.

1196
01:22:46,764 --> 01:22:55,731
[SPEAKER_11]: At no time prior to December 22nd, when one mother asked me about the financials, was I approached to discuss the PTG finances.

1197
01:22:56,751 --> 01:23:04,457
[SPEAKER_11]: And yet, the article came out a few days later, alleging, as Mr. Giro still claims, I was asked multiple times about financials.

1198
01:23:05,338 --> 01:23:10,962
[SPEAKER_11]: This is simply not true, and I have made my phone records readily available to substantiate the fact.

1199
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:15,205
[SPEAKER_11]: I rescheduled one meeting on December 28th.

1200
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,781
[SPEAKER_11]: not a whole host of meetings, as was written by Mr. Ejero.

1201
01:23:20,841 --> 01:23:25,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though I rescheduled that meeting, I sent that information to be shared via email.

1202
01:23:27,582 --> 01:23:31,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ejero continues to post about the bylaws the parents asked for multiple times.

1203
01:23:32,623 --> 01:23:38,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they should have been made available sooner, and I take full responsibility for that error.

1204
01:23:39,484 --> 01:23:44,825
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I apologized to the parents in our December meeting before the transcript article was published.

1205
01:23:46,144 --> 01:23:54,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Further, the current executive board had began discussing how the bylaws need to be amended even before we heard the Superintendent Belson's suggestion in his report.

1206
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,873
[SPEAKER_11]: We look forward to incorporating Superintendent's recommendations.

1207
01:23:59,794 --> 01:24:05,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Bylaws were not mentioned in my speech when I addressed Mr. Giro's accusations and defamations.

1208
01:24:07,856 --> 01:24:11,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Gero claims that the PTG buried the fine for late taxes.

1209
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,622
[SPEAKER_11]: However, the executive board at the time did not.

1210
01:24:15,302 --> 01:24:19,085
[SPEAKER_11]: It was reported immediately to the principal of the school, who is no longer there.

1211
01:24:19,986 --> 01:24:22,769
[SPEAKER_11]: We paid the penalties and have been in compliance ever since.

1212
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:32,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Gero is now claiming on social media that all of this went down before he was sworn in, and he therefore was acting as an ordinary citizen.

1213
01:24:33,273 --> 01:24:39,196
[SPEAKER_11]: If that were true, he would not have introduced himself to me on the phone as Mr. Ejero, Medford School Committee member.

1214
01:24:40,597 --> 01:24:47,741
[SPEAKER_11]: The transcript article on December 26, 2017, was titled, New School Committee Member.

1215
01:24:48,241 --> 01:24:51,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Parents raise questions about McGlynn Elementary PTG.

1216
01:24:52,997 --> 01:25:04,606
[SPEAKER_11]: The transcript editors wrote on Friday, if newspapers fail to report on statements and actions made by our elected officials, whom we vote for, and whose salaries we pay in taxes, everybody loses.

1217
01:25:05,627 --> 01:25:11,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero was identifying himself and acting as a school committee member despite not being sworn in yet.

1218
01:25:13,193 --> 01:25:18,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of the role of the school committee for the Medford Public Schools is to vote to set the policy,

1219
01:25:19,368 --> 01:25:24,990
[SPEAKER_11]: set the budget, and hire the superintendent and evaluate his or her work for the Medford Public Schools.

1220
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:38,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether he was acting as a school committee member or member elect is utterly inappropriate for him to publicly berate and single out a member of the PTG, especially when based on unfounded accusations and misinformation.

1221
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:48,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Even after the investigation's findings of no malfeasance, he continues to perpetuate the lies and misinformation on social media as recently as Friday.

1222
01:25:49,784 --> 01:26:00,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero seems to want it both ways, running for cover as an ordinary citizen when criticized for his handling of the situation, and then asserting as a public official he has a duty to get involved.

1223
01:26:02,322 --> 01:26:05,967
[SPEAKER_11]: As a public official, doesn't he have an obligation to set all the community

1224
01:26:08,301 --> 01:26:22,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't he have an obligation to all in the community to set an example and exercise sound judgment and ensure that which he elevates as a public concern is carefully reviewed before making unfounded accusations and personally attacking individuals in the community?

1225
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:31,820
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to also make you aware of a parent among Mr. Ruggiero's group who sent a threatening and harassing email to our president last Friday morning.

1226
01:26:32,661 --> 01:26:34,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I have copies of that email here for you to review.

1227
01:26:35,903 --> 01:26:50,308
[SPEAKER_11]: In this email, despite the discussions and recommendations last week, this father continues to berate the PTG and threatens to call the school department officials and the Medford transcript if his demands are not met and on his timeline.

1228
01:26:51,748 --> 01:27:04,793
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we are in agreement there are improvements that can and should be made, and I and the rest of the PTG board look forward to making those improvements with the administration and updating the bylaws and reporting procedures.

1229
01:27:05,752 --> 01:27:13,520
[SPEAKER_11]: However, in the meantime, it is concerning that we continue to be threatened and harassed by parents who are unwilling to accept that there was no malfeasance.

1230
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:23,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we are all volunteers doing the best that we can to plan, facilitate, and staff events and fundraisers for all of the students in our school.

1231
01:27:24,129 --> 01:27:28,233
[SPEAKER_11]: being threatened and harassed is unacceptable and it is counterproductive.

1232
01:27:29,273 --> 01:27:40,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I thank you for your time again this evening and hope that this matter can move on to more productive discourse and results in benefits for all stakeholders, most especially our students and teachers.

1233
01:27:40,883 --> 01:27:41,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

1234
01:27:41,344 --> 01:27:41,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Wright.

1235
01:27:41,564 --> 01:27:41,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1236
01:27:44,707 --> 01:27:45,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Shiro.

1237
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:51,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So this statement will not change any minds, those that know me.

1238
01:27:52,223 --> 01:27:54,905
[SPEAKER_05]: in my commitment to transparency already know my work ethic.

1239
01:27:55,965 --> 01:27:56,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I shall try my best.

1240
01:27:56,746 --> 01:27:57,886
[SPEAKER_09]: We're having trouble hearing you.

1241
01:27:57,906 --> 01:27:58,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, excuse me.

1242
01:27:58,447 --> 01:27:59,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll speak a little louder.

1243
01:28:00,288 --> 01:28:02,169
[SPEAKER_05]: This statement will not change any minds.

1244
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:07,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Those that know me in my commitment to transparency already know my work ethic.

1245
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:15,036
[SPEAKER_05]: For the rest, I shall try my best to open my heart and write as honestly as I can about this situation.

1246
01:28:15,936 --> 01:28:16,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Words matter.

1247
01:28:17,457 --> 01:28:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spent the past few weeks meditating on the words I've settled upon.

1248
01:28:21,639 --> 01:28:25,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I've prayed to help me see any terrible mistake that I might have made.

1249
01:28:26,561 --> 01:28:33,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spent sleepless nights rereading the article in the transcript and my quotes in them and searching my motivations.

1250
01:28:35,545 --> 01:28:45,270
[SPEAKER_05]: While I now have access to more means of dealing with these situations in the future as a school committee member,

1251
01:28:46,209 --> 01:28:50,551
[SPEAKER_05]: As a private citizen from the bottom of my heart, I really, I regret nothing.

1252
01:28:51,692 --> 01:28:52,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's why.

1253
01:28:53,573 --> 01:29:00,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to live in a city where every resident is free to challenge those in positions of power, even me.

1254
01:29:01,237 --> 01:29:08,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It may seem like a silly thing to believe that a treasurer or a president of a PTG occupies a position of power, but they do.

1255
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:16,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Every group that works inside of our schools and inside of our city government occupies a position of power.

1256
01:29:16,841 --> 01:29:24,705
[SPEAKER_05]: As a candidate, I came across a $6,092 mistake that many, many people did not know about.

1257
01:29:25,826 --> 01:29:34,710
[SPEAKER_05]: While I appreciate the treasurer's statement that she made the community aware, it seems that the issue is buried.

1258
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:36,951
[SPEAKER_05]: In my opinion,

1259
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:48,936
[SPEAKER_05]: This mistake should have been reported to the parents of Medford in 2014 when it happened, and not just maybe a small group of members of the PTG, but to the wider community at all.

1260
01:29:50,976 --> 01:29:55,677
[SPEAKER_05]: To my knowledge, neither Roy Belson nor many, many of the other parents knew about their losses of their donations.

1261
01:29:55,977 --> 01:30:06,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So after great deliberation with many of the parents involved, thinking about what kind of example we wanted to set our children, we decided to report the Ed Rarer to the people of Medford.

1262
01:30:07,785 --> 01:30:16,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I never once labeled any member of the McGlynn PTG a crook or a criminal or a monster.

1263
01:30:17,347 --> 01:30:25,288
[SPEAKER_05]: As a matter of fact, I never mentioned any names in any of the correspondence that we had in the transcript.

1264
01:30:27,689 --> 01:30:32,990
[SPEAKER_05]: In my heart, I knew that hard-earned money was wasted, and the people of Medford deserve to know.

1265
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:34,770
[SPEAKER_05]: So we called for transparency.

1266
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:43,584
[SPEAKER_05]: To the undecided in this room, I ask you, did you elect me to stay silent when I found evidence that money was wasted?

1267
01:30:44,045 --> 01:30:45,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you have preferred that I stand mute?

1268
01:30:49,287 --> 01:30:54,970
[SPEAKER_05]: If I find evidence that our schools have not used money properly, I'm going to speak up.

1269
01:30:55,671 --> 01:31:01,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I serve at your pleasure, but I forever stand as a fierce defender of the values I cherish and the city I love.

1270
01:31:02,674 --> 01:31:07,958
[SPEAKER_05]: The treasurer and the president of McGlynn PTG seem convinced that they run a tight ship.

1271
01:31:08,499 --> 01:31:09,179
[SPEAKER_05]: God bless them.

1272
01:31:09,559 --> 01:31:13,783
[SPEAKER_05]: They have worked very hard, and I appreciate all the time they have invested.

1273
01:31:14,283 --> 01:31:15,604
[SPEAKER_05]: But here are the facts.

1274
01:31:16,465 --> 01:31:20,208
[SPEAKER_05]: The laws of their group demand they present financial information when asked.

1275
01:31:20,648 --> 01:31:21,149
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't.

1276
01:31:22,129 --> 01:31:28,114
[SPEAKER_05]: The laws of their group demand they keep their rules and their ledgers handy at every meeting.

1277
01:31:28,895 --> 01:31:29,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't happen.

1278
01:31:30,467 --> 01:31:33,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Their rules require a budget at the beginning of the year, but it wasn't provided.

1279
01:31:35,209 --> 01:31:37,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Mothers felt belittled and humiliated.

1280
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:40,031
[SPEAKER_05]: How dare parents ask questions, eh?

1281
01:31:41,151 --> 01:31:48,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no doubt that every single parent at the McGlynn PTG loved the children and want to help our city grow.

1282
01:31:49,454 --> 01:31:53,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Nonetheless, you can't play fast and loose with the rules.

1283
01:31:54,183 --> 01:31:58,947
[SPEAKER_05]: You would think that after stumbling into such a chasm with the IRS, people would be a little more cautious.

1284
01:31:59,768 --> 01:32:00,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the facts.

1285
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:06,433
[SPEAKER_05]: But before you go, I think it's really time we can move forward.

1286
01:32:06,713 --> 01:32:08,675
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a great proposal on the table here.

1287
01:32:10,036 --> 01:32:12,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Parents will have financial information now when they're asked.

1288
01:32:12,858 --> 01:32:17,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Our school committees will work to help parent groups become as effective as possible.

1289
01:32:18,002 --> 01:32:19,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Training will be provided.

1290
01:32:19,944 --> 01:32:22,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Never again will thousands of dollars be lost into a hole.

1291
01:32:24,804 --> 01:32:27,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is an exciting time and I think we have a great proposal here.

1292
01:32:28,566 --> 01:32:33,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope everyone, both sides of this issue, look forward to moving.

1293
01:32:34,509 --> 01:32:34,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1294
01:32:35,169 --> 01:32:35,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1295
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:36,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1296
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:38,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Vander Kloot.

1297
01:32:39,952 --> 01:32:48,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Ruggiero, as a new colleague, I want you to know that I have no doubt at all that you meant no harm.

1298
01:32:51,116 --> 01:32:57,059
[SPEAKER_13]: You meant to be speaking up for parents, and in fact, were responding to parents' requests.

1299
01:32:57,659 --> 01:32:58,139
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that.

1300
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:02,581
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that you did it thinking that you were doing the very best thing.

1301
01:33:02,861 --> 01:33:06,102
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no, absolutely no doubt about that at all.

1302
01:33:06,683 --> 01:33:08,363
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think you meant to be heavy-handed.

1303
01:33:08,403 --> 01:33:10,784
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think you meant to cause this uproar.

1304
01:33:11,205 --> 01:33:12,025
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think so at all.

1305
01:33:13,085 --> 01:33:16,307
[SPEAKER_13]: I do think you were inexperienced, and frankly, you learn.

1306
01:33:18,428 --> 01:33:21,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you see, you know that it's caused great upset.

1307
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:24,712
[SPEAKER_13]: That was very evident the other night.

1308
01:33:27,194 --> 01:33:33,318
[SPEAKER_13]: We agree that we've now got some new things that have come out of this, maybe, and maybe that's all for the better.

1309
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:35,640
[SPEAKER_13]: But there were some really hurt feelings.

1310
01:33:38,062 --> 01:33:39,503
[SPEAKER_13]: The treasurer has asked for an apology.

1311
01:33:40,984 --> 01:33:45,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Saying I'm sorry doesn't cost you anything, and it would help to move on.

1312
01:33:47,086 --> 01:33:53,930
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand that you didn't mean to hurt, but frankly, you did.

1313
01:33:54,711 --> 01:33:55,151
[SPEAKER_13]: It happened.

1314
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:56,852
[SPEAKER_13]: It's happened to me.

1315
01:33:57,953 --> 01:33:59,634
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't mean to, but it did.

1316
01:34:00,174 --> 01:34:00,955
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, I'm sorry.

1317
01:34:01,815 --> 01:34:11,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes those two little words are just the easiest thing to say if they're heartfelt and meant, because I truly believe, I truly believe that you meant no harm.

1318
01:34:12,902 --> 01:34:14,824
[SPEAKER_13]: I look forward to working with you.

1319
01:34:15,784 --> 01:34:16,685
[SPEAKER_13]: I look forward to

1320
01:34:17,427 --> 01:34:19,208
[SPEAKER_13]: figuring out what it means to be a team.

1321
01:34:19,548 --> 01:34:23,191
[SPEAKER_13]: You and I have already had some discussions about personal styles, whatever.

1322
01:34:24,171 --> 01:34:28,634
[SPEAKER_13]: And in my view, it is time to move on.

1323
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:31,836
[SPEAKER_13]: But in order for that to happen, you need to say something.

1324
01:34:33,817 --> 01:34:36,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to say something?

1325
01:34:36,952 --> 01:34:38,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is Bailey Shindell.

1326
01:34:38,553 --> 01:34:40,494
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 46 Washington Street.

1327
01:34:40,815 --> 01:34:44,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a parent of a kindergartner at the McGlynn School.

1328
01:34:44,777 --> 01:34:53,723
[SPEAKER_12]: At the beginning of this year, I started going to PTG meetings and was very excited about being part of the McGlynn PTG.

1329
01:34:54,544 --> 01:35:01,268
[SPEAKER_12]: I've done lots of kind of community building work in the past in lots of different

1330
01:35:01,965 --> 01:35:09,312
[SPEAKER_12]: forums and so I was excited to share my skills with the PTG.

1331
01:35:09,332 --> 01:35:20,642
[SPEAKER_12]: I felt the need to speak tonight, I don't have anything prepared because I feel like this situation has been, I've gathered with other parents

1332
01:35:21,963 --> 01:35:30,108
[SPEAKER_12]: to work with McGlynn PFTG and I feel like our position has been misrepresented in this forum.

1333
01:35:31,088 --> 01:35:44,356
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like we've been looked at as parents who came in and just tried to take over everything without listening or trying to get an idea of what the process was for participating in this organization.

1334
01:35:45,736 --> 01:36:00,825
[SPEAKER_12]: I've spent the last couple days, it's not finished yet, but putting together a timeline of how we engaged or attempted to engage with this organization that's well documented through emails and summaries of meetings.

1335
01:36:00,905 --> 01:36:03,687
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I basically have a practice from my

1336
01:36:05,068 --> 01:36:09,611
[SPEAKER_12]: from my experience of writing summaries after every meeting that I attend.

1337
01:36:10,572 --> 01:36:30,207
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to say that, you know, we have documentation to show that each step of the way we approach and continue to approach the leadership of the McGlynn PTG and ask them to work with us and we are still being met with contention even to this day.

1338
01:36:31,727 --> 01:36:41,230
[SPEAKER_12]: The, there was, I personally felt, I mean, the most recent thing was these minutes that happened from the last meeting were posted.

1339
01:36:42,131 --> 01:36:46,292
[SPEAKER_12]: There wasn't any process or approval of the minutes before they were posted in a public forum.

1340
01:36:46,752 --> 01:36:51,794
[SPEAKER_12]: The minutes were not representative of the meeting that we had.

1341
01:36:51,934 --> 01:36:54,814
[SPEAKER_12]: I felt specifically like I had,

1342
01:36:57,236 --> 01:37:04,481
[SPEAKER_12]: asked for certain information from the McGlynn leadership and that was not recorded in the minutes in any way.

1343
01:37:05,702 --> 01:37:25,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I then have emailed the McGlynn leadership, again, in each email really trying to say how much I just really, still to this day, really want to work with this group and know by whatever process put in front of me to make changes and to

1344
01:37:25,937 --> 01:37:28,298
[SPEAKER_12]: to provide things for our children.

1345
01:37:28,838 --> 01:37:36,059
[SPEAKER_12]: And my email was not, or has not been responded to, or my concerns have not been addressed.

1346
01:37:36,339 --> 01:37:51,882
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been, throughout this entire process, I've received conflicting information on how things are done, which then that information, after finally receiving the bylaws, was conflicted with the bylaws themselves.

1347
01:37:52,122 --> 01:37:55,483
[SPEAKER_12]: These are very concerning things that were happening.

1348
01:37:56,143 --> 01:38:08,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to say that while, I mean, when we started looking at the finances, it was only because we wanted to get an understanding of what the money was being spent on.

1349
01:38:08,833 --> 01:38:11,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Mostly so we could be like, yes, this is what they do.

1350
01:38:15,778 --> 01:38:22,101
[SPEAKER_12]: told, you know, we do stuff, but we haven't, we've asked several times, like, let's get a list of what you do.

1351
01:38:22,721 --> 01:38:34,507
[SPEAKER_12]: And we do stuff, the finances and the minutes from the meetings that I've requested several times would help me put together a better picture so I could brag about what they do when I try to promote the McGlynn PTG.

1352
01:38:35,027 --> 01:38:41,330
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's unreasonable for me to want to have a better understanding of the organization that I want to get involved in.

1353
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:45,072
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think right now I'm speaking for myself, but I think

1354
01:38:45,652 --> 01:38:50,875
[SPEAKER_12]: the sentiment I'm putting forth is representative of other parents that I've been working with.

1355
01:38:52,555 --> 01:38:54,856
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to grow this organization.

1356
01:38:55,097 --> 01:39:01,880
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to do great things for the McGlynn students and we want to do that by working with these women and

1357
01:39:03,483 --> 01:39:04,905
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to be brought in.

1358
01:39:05,646 --> 01:39:12,874
[SPEAKER_12]: That's I guess that's all I actually want to speak to the $6000 mistake.

1359
01:39:13,135 --> 01:39:15,037
[SPEAKER_12]: And I absolutely believe it was a mistake.

1360
01:39:15,157 --> 01:39:18,361
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm really concerned about the fact that

1361
01:39:19,522 --> 01:39:27,766
[SPEAKER_12]: That money had to be paid out of McGlynn PTG funds and McGlynn PTG funds are raised from the parents of our school.

1362
01:39:27,806 --> 01:39:32,669
[SPEAKER_12]: The parents that we've already talked about not necessarily have a lot of finances.

1363
01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:40,373
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do think it's important that if we as a group are asking parents for money that we're telling them where it's going.

1364
01:39:41,413 --> 01:39:54,683
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think any of the parents that bought pies in 2014, 15, whenever that fund was actually paid, like were aware that $6,000 of their money was going to pay for this mistake.

1365
01:39:54,703 --> 01:39:58,966
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's a fair thing for them to have knowledge of.

1366
01:39:59,926 --> 01:40:00,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

1367
01:40:01,087 --> 01:40:01,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1368
01:40:01,367 --> 01:40:03,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to respond briefly.

1369
01:40:03,449 --> 01:40:07,592
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, this has been, is there another individual that would like to speak?

1370
01:40:12,185 --> 01:40:13,406
[SPEAKER_16]: My name's Carrie Cropper.

1371
01:40:13,787 --> 01:40:18,371
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm at 61 Dudley Street and I was also one of the kindergarten parents.

1372
01:40:20,173 --> 01:40:24,037
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted to say that we keep getting referred to as for kindergarten parents.

1373
01:40:24,637 --> 01:40:26,579
[SPEAKER_16]: That makes me sound like I'm not knowledgeable.

1374
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:30,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Three of the kindergarten parents own their own businesses.

1375
01:40:31,013 --> 01:40:34,595
[SPEAKER_16]: we are well aware of how finances should work.

1376
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:39,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone here is going to say it's just as important what comes out of the kitty as what goes in.

1377
01:40:40,338 --> 01:40:41,959
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was the question we were asked.

1378
01:40:42,679 --> 01:40:57,467
[SPEAKER_16]: When Bailey was just talking about the meeting minutes, to put in the meeting minutes that I asked about pizzas, I think is not a fair representation of when I say what do we spend our money on for expenses, for fundraisers.

1379
01:41:01,283 --> 01:41:16,211
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't get up to speak last time during our last meeting because I realize that our PTG board has every right to protect the culture of the PTG.

1380
01:41:16,751 --> 01:41:22,475
[SPEAKER_16]: And Jane had every right to speak about that she was hurt and that she was offended and she felt attacked.

1381
01:41:23,055 --> 01:41:23,975
[SPEAKER_16]: That's their right.

1382
01:41:24,736 --> 01:41:28,218
[SPEAKER_16]: It was my right and our parents' right to be given bylaws.

1383
01:41:28,838 --> 01:41:29,839
[SPEAKER_16]: It was unfair.

1384
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:38,295
[SPEAKER_16]: when we asked five times over the course of 30 days, which is standard, to be given bylaws, and we were not given them.

1385
01:41:38,876 --> 01:41:47,342
[SPEAKER_16]: It was unfair to stand in their presence while they held the bylaws and did not give them to us, and said, we're not sure if this is the correct version.

1386
01:41:47,842 --> 01:41:48,883
[SPEAKER_16]: We will get back to you.

1387
01:41:49,203 --> 01:41:50,444
[SPEAKER_16]: That was unfair.

1388
01:41:52,986 --> 01:41:56,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Since then, we've seen that the bylaws are not always what we're told.

1389
01:41:57,208 --> 01:42:02,730
[SPEAKER_16]: The night that they held the bylaws and didn't give them to us, we clarified, what are our voting rights?

1390
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:06,691
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were told, you don't have voting rights.

1391
01:42:07,291 --> 01:42:10,132
[SPEAKER_16]: You have the right to vote us into the board.

1392
01:42:11,432 --> 01:42:13,573
[SPEAKER_16]: We will listen to what you have to say.

1393
01:42:14,333 --> 01:42:16,254
[SPEAKER_16]: But you don't have voting rights.

1394
01:42:20,675 --> 01:42:21,575
[SPEAKER_16]: This is America.

1395
01:42:21,616 --> 01:42:23,136
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a democracy, right?

1396
01:42:23,196 --> 01:42:25,057
[SPEAKER_16]: We should have some sort of voting rights.

1397
01:42:28,427 --> 01:42:30,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Bailey asked after that meeting and we got the bylaws.

1398
01:42:31,288 --> 01:42:35,228
[SPEAKER_16]: It clearly says, at least by our interpretation, that we should have some voting rights.

1399
01:42:35,828 --> 01:42:37,029
[SPEAKER_16]: It said there should be a budget.

1400
01:42:37,489 --> 01:42:40,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything outside of that budget, we get to vote on.

1401
01:42:41,529 --> 01:42:44,390
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what we've been fighting for.

1402
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:55,472
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys don't know me, but my family, my mom was a commission human rights relation person for 25 years for the state of Delaware.

1403
01:42:55,896 --> 01:42:58,419
[SPEAKER_16]: And my dad is a retired police officer.

1404
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:00,822
[SPEAKER_16]: I grew up in a family of civil service.

1405
01:43:01,503 --> 01:43:03,165
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've never stood up and talked.

1406
01:43:03,366 --> 01:43:04,567
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not who I am.

1407
01:43:05,388 --> 01:43:14,100
[SPEAKER_16]: But I find myself angry and standing up and unable to sit down because I feel like this is not what it's about.

1408
01:43:14,687 --> 01:43:16,568
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about doing this for our kids.

1409
01:43:16,769 --> 01:43:22,493
[SPEAKER_16]: And if, when was the last time you were at a meeting and the two people beside you said, I will get in and help.

1410
01:43:22,973 --> 01:43:24,254
[SPEAKER_16]: I will build you a website.

1411
01:43:24,775 --> 01:43:31,700
[SPEAKER_16]: I will throw some fundraisers and pay for them out of my pocket and grow this community that is the McGlynn and we really can be great.

1412
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:34,962
[SPEAKER_16]: And you look around at Medford and we all chose to be here.

1413
01:43:35,363 --> 01:43:37,184
[SPEAKER_16]: We chose to be parents at the McGlynn.

1414
01:43:37,732 --> 01:43:40,413
[SPEAKER_16]: We all, if you talk to us, we all looked at private schools.

1415
01:43:40,473 --> 01:43:44,074
[SPEAKER_16]: We all talked about, well, maybe we'll petition to go to the Roberts.

1416
01:43:44,114 --> 01:43:44,955
[SPEAKER_16]: We live closer.

1417
01:43:44,975 --> 01:43:47,516
[SPEAKER_16]: And we chose the McGlynn.

1418
01:43:47,576 --> 01:43:56,699
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't think I should be maligned because I need to buck up under this is the way it's always been, and this is the way it will always be.

1419
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:02,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford as a city is energetic, and it's changing, and it's a really exciting place to live.

1420
01:44:02,862 --> 01:44:06,083
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think looking at these PTG laws,

1421
01:44:06,985 --> 01:44:11,448
[SPEAKER_16]: and moving forward with them, it would be a really, you know, I'm just excited about it.

1422
01:44:11,628 --> 01:44:13,769
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like it's a good starting place.

1423
01:44:14,589 --> 01:44:32,099
[SPEAKER_16]: My only request is maybe you can also, you could also encourage a mission statement for these groups that does not strictly say it is a top-down policy, but that it is also a bottom-up listening structure.

1424
01:44:32,619 --> 01:44:32,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1425
01:44:35,295 --> 01:44:35,976
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to move this.

1426
01:44:36,156 --> 01:44:37,858
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot on our agenda tonight.

1427
01:44:37,898 --> 01:44:41,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for being here and giving your side.

1428
01:44:42,264 --> 01:44:44,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And we certainly will move forward with the committee on rules.

1429
01:44:44,226 --> 01:44:47,370
[SPEAKER_09]: The subcommittee will be looking at the policy and procedures going forward.

1430
01:44:48,613 --> 01:44:51,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Next item up is item 7, negotiations and legal matters.

1431
01:44:51,354 --> 01:44:54,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked someone to move suspension of the rules to move to the end of the agenda.

1432
01:44:54,535 --> 01:44:56,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1433
01:44:57,016 --> 01:44:57,756
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1434
01:44:57,776 --> 01:44:57,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1435
01:44:58,737 --> 01:44:59,537
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1436
01:44:59,897 --> 01:45:01,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Negotiations will be at the end.

1437
01:45:02,138 --> 01:45:02,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Old business.

1438
01:45:02,878 --> 01:45:07,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation to adopt USDA revised required school lunch charge policy.

1439
01:45:08,262 --> 01:45:11,504
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, in our committee of the whole last week, we asked Ms.

1440
01:45:11,524 --> 01:45:14,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Patterson to make a few more adjustments to the policy.

1441
01:45:14,906 --> 01:45:16,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, we have with us the final version.

1442
01:45:17,608 --> 01:45:18,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent?

1443
01:45:19,670 --> 01:45:20,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Just briefly?

1444
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:23,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe we made the adjustments you asked for.

1445
01:45:24,032 --> 01:45:26,954
[SPEAKER_01]: The amounts and thresholds in the area, so I'd ask that you approve it.

1446
01:45:28,816 --> 01:45:30,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

1447
01:45:30,717 --> 01:45:31,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Offered by Ms.

1448
01:45:31,337 --> 01:45:32,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone, seconded by Ms.

1449
01:45:32,598 --> 01:45:32,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Kritz.

1450
01:45:33,699 --> 01:45:35,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote on the policy change.

1451
01:45:39,742 --> 01:45:44,723
[SPEAKER_09]: We announced them in the Committee of the Whole, and we'll publish the policy online as well.

1452
01:45:46,004 --> 01:45:51,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1453
01:45:51,885 --> 01:45:53,686
Motion passes.

1454
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:15,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, during our Committee of the Whole, we voted in Executive Session to adopt a wage increase for our sub-cafeteria workers, who are currently being paid $11 per hour.

1455
01:46:15,626 --> 01:46:18,007
[SPEAKER_09]: It will go up to $13 per hour.

1456
01:46:18,427 --> 01:46:22,969
[SPEAKER_09]: That paper has been moved out of Executive Committee and is before the body to adopt.

1457
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:25,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Ms.

1458
01:46:25,431 --> 01:46:26,591

01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:27,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone.

1460
01:46:27,111 --> 01:46:27,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

1461
01:46:29,511 --> 01:46:33,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

1462
01:46:33,375 --> 01:46:35,217
Negative motion passes.

1463
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:45,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Communication.

1464
01:46:45,781 --> 01:46:48,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation to approve overnight field trip.

1465
01:46:48,342 --> 01:46:55,347
[SPEAKER_09]: We have an overnight ski trip with Tufts Mountain Club.

1466
01:46:55,367 --> 01:47:01,731
[SPEAKER_09]: The trip has been approved by the headmaster, this is from Medford High School, and the required forms have been submitted and approved.

1467
01:47:01,751 --> 01:47:02,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion for approval?

1468
01:47:05,043 --> 01:47:06,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Ms.

1469
01:47:06,304 --> 01:47:06,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Kretz.

1470
01:47:07,184 --> 01:47:07,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Benedetto.

1471
01:47:08,124 --> 01:47:08,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1472
01:47:09,585 --> 01:47:15,887
[SPEAKER_17]: On this, I reviewed it, and I didn't see a sign off from the school nurse, so it says the email is attached.

1473
01:47:16,628 --> 01:47:26,832
[SPEAKER_17]: And the email that it's attached only says, please provide me with a list of students so that way I can let you know if there's any medical.

1474
01:47:27,592 --> 01:47:29,393
[SPEAKER_17]: There was no official write off.

1475
01:47:32,085 --> 01:47:39,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you look.

1476
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:46,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have the list of students yet because I wasn't able to finalize the list until I got approval of the committee.

1477
01:47:46,655 --> 01:47:57,923
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is my point with the new paperwork that we just required everybody to fill out is you need a list of students going before you send it out for permission slips.

1478
01:47:57,963 --> 01:48:01,045
[SPEAKER_17]: So you don't have the list until it's approved.

1479
01:48:01,650 --> 01:48:02,671
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's like a catch-22?

1480
01:48:02,831 --> 01:48:07,897
[SPEAKER_09]: No, aren't we supposed to approve the trip before they can go to their students, too?

1481
01:48:08,117 --> 01:48:08,358
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1482
01:48:08,438 --> 01:48:16,267
[SPEAKER_17]: But the way that the form does, it asks for the list of students when they're filling out the form, so that way they can get the approval from the nurse.

1483
01:48:16,327 --> 01:48:21,753
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think other schools are having this issue as well, that I've been told about.

1484
01:48:22,245 --> 01:48:34,355
[SPEAKER_17]: So like you can't, the nurse can't tell you how many children or if any children have any medical issues that my nurse may be necessary or medications may be necessary or delegation of medications may be necessary.

1485
01:48:34,775 --> 01:48:37,718
[SPEAKER_17]: So we might need to re look at this event.

1486
01:48:37,838 --> 01:48:38,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1487
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:41,121
[SPEAKER_17]: So we need to, we need to change this.

1488
01:48:41,201 --> 01:48:43,563
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd like you to look at that issue.

1489
01:48:43,643 --> 01:48:45,704
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we've talked about it on the phone this week.

1490
01:48:46,345 --> 01:48:46,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Um,

1491
01:48:47,226 --> 01:49:09,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Superintendent Belson and so like if you if this I'm noticing this problem here So we need to get our initial approvals going and then provide a list and then the nurse thing which is difficult because then you get a estimate what the cost of the trip is with or without a nurse so We want to make it we want to make it

1492
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:12,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's keep it simple.

1493
01:49:12,746 --> 01:49:13,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep it simple.

1494
01:49:14,087 --> 01:49:18,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, if there's a situation that requires an additional cost, we'll bring it back to you.

1495
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:22,973
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's no such, you know, cost, let's not make people come back and forth five times.

1496
01:49:23,033 --> 01:49:27,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the goal of this was to be inclusive and to provide appropriate care.

1497
01:49:28,137 --> 01:49:30,458
[SPEAKER_01]: If it turns out that we have a situation, we'll bring it back.

1498
01:49:31,159 --> 01:49:31,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1499
01:49:31,879 --> 01:49:36,963
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with that, but just make sure that all policy, everybody approving this,

1500
01:49:38,121 --> 01:49:59,195
[SPEAKER_17]: and all teachers filling this out know that, like it says here that you have to have a nurse's signature, and if someone's trying to fill this out correctly, the teacher is gonna say, I can't get the signature or curriculum director's signature, and it only says one is, what if it's, you know, it's getting tricky for people.

1501
01:49:59,255 --> 01:50:01,977
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm getting phone calls about it, so it's getting tricky for people.

1502
01:50:02,137 --> 01:50:03,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll move through it.

1503
01:50:03,458 --> 01:50:05,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some people that resist any,

1504
01:50:06,436 --> 01:50:10,199
[SPEAKER_01]: early this evening you're telling me that I'm making things too bureaucratic for the PTO.

1505
01:50:10,579 --> 01:50:10,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1506
01:50:10,759 --> 01:50:14,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you you're making things too bureaucratic for the teachers and everything like that.

1507
01:50:14,482 --> 01:50:15,002
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

1508
01:50:15,022 --> 01:50:15,863
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll work it out.

1509
01:50:15,923 --> 01:50:17,184
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is a bigger issue.

1510
01:50:17,264 --> 01:50:24,549
[SPEAKER_17]: I want, if there's a change necessary because we just approved this, then we need to make those edits and make it easier for our staff.

1511
01:50:24,609 --> 01:50:25,709
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not trying to make it harder.

1512
01:50:26,210 --> 01:50:27,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to take it down.

1513
01:50:27,291 --> 01:50:31,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, obviously the nurses indicated it's okay until she sees something specific.

1514
01:50:32,454 --> 01:50:34,355
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something comes up, we'll come bring it back.

1515
01:50:34,435 --> 01:50:37,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval of the trip by Ms.

1516
01:50:37,636 --> 01:50:38,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Kretz, seconded by Ms.

1540
01:51:47,047 --> 01:51:47,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1541
01:51:47,227 --> 01:51:51,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Hallisey was the owner of Colleen's Ice Cream Shop and an active community participant.

1542
01:51:52,351 --> 01:51:57,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Joseph McAdam.

1543
01:51:57,315 --> 01:52:00,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. McAdam was the father of retired high school teacher John McAdam.

1544
01:52:01,099 --> 01:52:02,620
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could all, we have an addition.

1545
01:52:03,661 --> 01:52:07,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Joseph Navetta was the husband of Angela Navetta, our retired secretary.

1546
01:52:08,697 --> 01:52:16,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, condolences on the passing of Joseph Neveda, who is the husband of Angela Neveda, who is a retired school department employee.

1547
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:20,842
[SPEAKER_09]: All please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of these citizens.

1548
01:52:31,927 --> 01:52:33,388
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually is the end of our meeting.

1549
01:52:33,428 --> 01:52:37,550
[SPEAKER_09]: We did have negotiations and legal matters, which were the cafeteria workers, that we took a vote on.

1550
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:38,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Burke?

1551
01:52:39,031 --> 01:52:47,635
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for... Before we close, can I just remind the superintendent there are a couple items under requested reports that were due in January 2018.

1552
01:52:48,135 --> 01:52:56,719
[SPEAKER_17]: So the update report on enrollments in January 2018, including prospective number of students and new developments with units of 100...

1553
01:52:59,587 --> 01:53:04,149
[SPEAKER_17]: That was requested September 18th, and it was due in January 2018.

1554
01:53:04,529 --> 01:53:07,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you update us with the prospective date?

1555
01:53:10,211 --> 01:53:18,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, and my last one is an update of next steps for RTI requested for February 1st.

1556
01:53:18,173 --> 01:53:23,875
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just a reminder, it's not February 1st yet, but I will be expecting that report soon.

1557
01:53:24,962 --> 01:53:31,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the mayor to the superintendent to change the date till February 28th.

1558
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:36,455
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if it's leap year.

1559
01:53:45,784 --> 01:53:52,350
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll amend requested reports, the fourth bullet down to be due February 28th, or end of month.

1560
01:53:52,551 --> 01:53:59,997
[SPEAKER_17]: And I look forward to the report on the enrollments including the prospective number of students in new developments at our next meeting.

1561
01:54:01,098 --> 01:54:01,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1562
01:54:04,869 --> 01:54:10,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Before we leave tonight, I wanted to bring up one other discussion, which I thought Mr. Ruggiero might.

1563
01:54:11,436 --> 01:54:23,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Today, Mr. Ruggiero put online our packet of information, and I think that there was

1564
01:54:24,766 --> 01:54:33,353
[SPEAKER_13]: One piece, which I was uncomfortable with, which actually had to do with the ski trip, it didn't have names on it, but if there was names, I wanted that to be posted.

1565
01:54:33,793 --> 01:54:42,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't certain that I wanted everybody in the public to know exactly where the kids were going, what time they were going, whatever, just as a safety thing.

1566
01:54:42,961 --> 01:54:43,622
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that

1567
01:54:44,042 --> 01:54:58,405
[SPEAKER_13]: it's long been a thought that I know other school committee members share, that some of our documents, rather than having this big stack of papers, could be online for us as well.

1568
01:54:59,065 --> 01:55:08,427
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think that we should take both things together, figure out, there were some questions about

1569
01:55:09,645 --> 01:55:13,067
[SPEAKER_13]: afterwards, which people in the public raised, which I certainly wouldn't have thought about.

1570
01:55:13,087 --> 01:55:21,750
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was interesting input of saying, how do you best post our information for our meetings?

1571
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:38,297
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to make a motion, maybe in conjunction with Mr. Ruggiero, that we search how we're going to effectively put our documents online, both for the public and also so that we can

1572
01:55:38,777 --> 01:55:43,799
[SPEAKER_13]: minimize the amount of paper that we have for our meetings.

1573
01:55:44,359 --> 01:55:54,943
[SPEAKER_13]: As a long-term school committee member, I can tell you that I could devote, I mean, whole rooms, buckets fills of these exist, and frankly, it's just way too much.

1574
01:55:55,143 --> 01:56:08,148
[SPEAKER_09]: As I mentioned to Mr. Ruggiero earlier, I spoke to the superintendent earlier today about that, the possibility of us going paperless with an iPad to do our work, and at the same time, when they're uploading the files for us, they can upload it to a separate

1575
01:56:08,599 --> 01:56:12,941
[SPEAKER_09]: the school website for all to see what the backup is to the agenda item.

1576
01:56:12,981 --> 01:56:14,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So the superintendent and I are going to work on that.

1577
01:56:15,102 --> 01:56:15,983
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, I made a motion.

1578
01:56:16,183 --> 01:56:18,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we want to just officialize it?

1579
01:56:19,104 --> 01:56:19,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1580
01:56:19,304 --> 01:56:22,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we move that issue to the Community Relations Subcommittee?

1581
01:56:22,606 --> 01:56:29,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a number of people have talked to me about how can we publicize our policies more effectively in conjunction with our own services?

1582
01:56:29,769 --> 01:56:30,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1583
01:56:30,349 --> 01:56:31,310
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll include that in the amendment.

1584
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:36,232
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion that this be moved to the Community Relations Subcommittee.

1585
01:56:36,632 --> 01:56:37,113
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion.

1586
01:56:38,336 --> 01:56:39,057
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1587
01:56:39,498 --> 01:56:39,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1588
01:56:39,859 --> 01:56:40,520
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1589
01:56:40,580 --> 01:56:41,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

1590
01:56:42,003 --> 01:56:42,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn.
