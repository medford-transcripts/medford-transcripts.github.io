00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:29,896
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Method.

2
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:46,480
I am John Petrella, and the purpose of this program is to give Method citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

3
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,061
But before I introduce today's special guest,

4
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:22,457
I just want to take a moment to extend an invitation to any member of the Medford City Council and any member of the Medford School Committee who is a candidate for re-election or to any new candidate running for office in Medford to appear on Medford Happenings.

5
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:29,352
to share their positions on current issues facing the city.

6
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:39,958
You can reach us at MethodHappenings02155 at gmail.com and that's how you reach us.

7
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:54,875
Now, to get to our special guest today, it's Mr. Rick Caviello, who is a candidate for the Method City Council.

8
00:01:56,257 --> 00:02:05,026
Rick has given many, many years of service to the city of Method, including 12 years as a city councilor,

9
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,612
He was elected council president I think three times.

10
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:25,541
He was instrumental in the development, very instrumental, in the development of the new library as vice president and treasurer of the Meffitt Public Library Foundation.

11
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:29,223
Rick was also the distinguished president

12
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:40,671
of the Method Kiwanis, and he received the Citizen of the Year, which is something special, in 2023.

13
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:47,978
Much, much more that Rick has done, and we will get into it later on.

14
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,082
Rick, finally, welcome to the show.

15
00:02:52,193 --> 00:02:52,733
Thank you, John.

16
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:54,675
Thank you for having me on this afternoon.

17
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:55,856
It's our pleasure.

18
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:59,059
As usual, we'll get right into the show.

19
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,422
So, Rick, we wanna get started.

20
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:08,087
Give us, you know, give the audience some background information about yourself.

21
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:08,968
Thank you.

22
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:11,670
So, I'm a lifelong Memphis resident.

23
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,112
I'm 71 years old.

24
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:17,856
I'm married to my wife, Carol, for 49 years.

25
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:20,541
I know that's a long time.

26
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:27,544
I have three children, Richard, Lauren, and Nicole, and I have eight grandchildren.

27
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:46,531
So about myself, John, you know, I've spent most of my adult life as a community volunteer, whether it be at the Chamber of Commerce, the Kiwanis, Medford Youth Hockey, the Food Bank, and multiple other things.

28
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:47,992
I've pretty much given

29
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:59,675
most of my time to the city of Medford and I'm something I'm quite proud of You've done a Tremendous amount for the city.

30
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:15,484
Thank you And there's a lot more we can mention we won't but I know you've helped a lot of people Thank you that a lot of people don't even know about the things you've done Alright, so here's a good question for you Can you give us?

31
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:22,529
You know, a few reasons why you decided to run for a seat on the City Council again.

32
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,272
Well, the first reason is, you know, my love for the community.

33
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:32,136
As you know, I've been off the council for a year.

34
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:35,759
I ran unsuccessfully for mayor last semester.

35
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:36,800
I don't like

36
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,861
the way that some of the community is going.

37
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:44,882
One of the big things that hurts me is the divide in the community.

38
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:48,863
I feel that we should be more of a unified community.

39
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:56,086
I don't like this us versus them mentality that's going around and all the things that get written on social media.

40
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,087
We're one city, we're one community.

41
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:03,889
Let's find common avenues and common bonds to move forward.

42
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,521
That's and that's part.

43
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:07,261
That's the big reason.

44
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:07,602
Yeah.

45
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:25,380
No, and I agree and that's a great reason because Like you I've been here most of my life and I've never seen it like this never with with the The division it's really bad and we need people You know, it's just not a local issue anymore.

46
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,822
It's become a national issue.

47
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:27,062
Yeah, I

48
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:48,095
uh you know with with you know just a division of division in politics and it's it's not right uh the way it is you know um this is america and everyone is entitled to their opinion we don't have to agree with but this is what makes our country great is we can agree to disagree and still be friends at the end of the day yes i loved it when we had that yeah we would have some pretty good

49
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:55,919
political talk, whatever, but after the talk, we were still friends, we still got along and everything else.

50
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:56,580
Thank you.

51
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,022
Yeah, it'd be nice to bring that back.

52
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:04,101
All right, so that's a good reason, a really good reason.

53
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:10,647
You know, you've had a, we mentioned it, I mentioned it in the introduction, Rick.

54
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:13,009
You've done a lot for the city.

55
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,631
You got a lot of accomplishments.

56
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:22,238
Can you tell us, I mean, is there a few you could pick out that, you know, you're most proud of?

57
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:24,480
Things really that meant a lot to you.

58
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,603
Well, obviously, the library.

59
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:27,904
Yes.

60
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:33,951
I worked on that for four years just to get them to come to the city.

61
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,073
And I can't take all the credit for that.

62
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:39,197
You know, the administration takes credit because of the funding.

63
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:46,360
With the library came, with that work came $12 million in upfront funding.

64
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,644
And I was also part of a foundation that helped raise over $6 million to sustain the library.

65
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,125
So I think the city got a pretty good deal.

66
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:59,647
We own a brand new library for not a lot of money.

67
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:00,808
So I'm proud of that.

68
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:06,091
I was also upfront with Michael Marks in bringing the art center.

69
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:08,352
It's not about taking credit.

70
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:09,873
It's about getting the thing done.

71
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:10,974
I was up front with that.

72
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:25,738
I was also both an executive director and president of the Chamber of Commerce.

73
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:35,801
Many people don't remember, when Cheryl White passed away during my term, I stepped into that office for a year and a half so we wouldn't lose our Chamber of Commerce.

74
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,062
I've been heavily involved with the Kiwanis.

75
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:43,043
And some of the things I did with the Kiwanis,

76
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:50,986
I chaired the literacy program where we gave reading books to all first and third grade children in the city of Medford.

77
00:07:51,806 --> 00:08:02,611
I was on both the director and president of the Youth Hockey Association when we had almost thousands of kids there.

78
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:05,072
I volunteer at the food bank.

79
00:08:07,215 --> 00:08:11,277
You know, I'm where anybody asks me to be.

80
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,199
I fought with St.

81
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,160
Raphael's Food Bank.

82
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,982
So I continue to stay involved.

83
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:26,406
Another thing I'm really proud of is my work with the veterans in the community.

84
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,507
We had a...

85
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:33,831
We had a request from a World War II veteran that hadn't been out of his house for a couple of years.

86
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:40,176
And when we went over there, the wife says, well, why are you here?

87
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:41,637
I said, well, I thought you wanted a ramp.

88
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:44,179
She says, no, we needed an elevator.

89
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,521
I said, well, it's not an elevator.

90
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:52,026
It's kind of a little bit out of my league, but I says, well, let me see.

91
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:52,886
So I left.

92
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,402
And I called my go-to veteran, Don Marcelino.

93
00:08:57,722 --> 00:08:57,983
Yes.

94
00:08:58,263 --> 00:09:00,124
I said, Don, I explained him what this problem was.

95
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:00,785
He said, well, let me see.

96
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:02,766
He calls me back within an hour.

97
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:08,511
He says, there's a lady that just bought a house that has an elevator.

98
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:10,052
They'd like to get rid of it.

99
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:11,833
And I said, oh, wow, great.

100
00:09:12,173 --> 00:09:12,914
We went by there.

101
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:14,635
I called the family back.

102
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:16,056
He says, Merry Christmas.

103
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:19,059
We're going to install an elevator.

104
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:19,659
And I want to thank

105
00:09:20,915 --> 00:09:24,916
the Murphy brothers, for all their time and effort that they put into that.

106
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:42,861
And another one, we had a gentleman, a Vietnam veteran on Spring Street, had a paralyzed daughter, and daughter didn't have a bedroom or anything, and the people from Mill Creek stepped in and took her.

107
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:58,052
gave us probably over $200,000 in time and effort, and we redid a whole house for this man and his daughter, between bedrooms, showers, we got a hospital bed donated for her, a lift.

108
00:09:59,493 --> 00:10:04,995
And I still, up to this day, I still do the food drive at Christmas and Thanksgiving for the veterans.

109
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:09,836
So those are some of the things that, you know, even though I'm not involved, I still am involved with stuff.

110
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:10,897
You're very involved.

111
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,017
You can say all you want, you're not involved.

112
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:18,179
I know because, you know, I've known you for quite a while and I'm glad.

113
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:22,900
You know, guys like you don't get the credit they deserve.

114
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,041
That's the way I feel.

115
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:27,582
There's a lot more things that you've done.

116
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:30,944
I know some of these people, and it means the world to them.

117
00:10:30,984 --> 00:10:36,486
And I know someone else you got a ramp for, you played a big part of, and that was huge.

118
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:38,967
And, you know, I thank you.

119
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:42,969
And, you know, I look back at the library, and I always,

120
00:10:44,009 --> 00:11:08,907
I mean what what you what what you do with the library and even with the arts I don't think people in Medford can really like understand or appreciate what really happened the work that went into it and I know Michael Marks uh had a lot to do with that the art center as well but you guys really got this all rolling and well John you know this comes with

121
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,655
building relationships in the community.

122
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:13,135
And that's what it's about.

123
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:26,480
I've lived here my whole life, I have friends here, and I've developed relationships both within the city, at the state house, and at the federal level.

124
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,741
I have people that I can call there.

125
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:33,162
So when anyone needs help, I'm able to assist them in really any way that's needed.

126
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:37,084
Even though I can't do anything, I can at least get them into the right direction.

127
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,465
You know people that want to help.

128
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:40,205
That's what it is.

129
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:45,587
You're a good guy and, you know, negotiating and everything else, you know, all that stuff.

130
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:48,708
You're very experienced at it.

131
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:54,610
I can go on like this for a long time, but I know, you know, we're limited in time here.

132
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:01,013
But I want to personally thank you, and it's nice for the city to know, the people of the city to know.

133
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:02,914
Thanks and unnecessary.

134
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:04,274
This is something that we just do.

135
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:06,756
We do it because we know it's the right thing to do.

136
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:06,976
Yep.

137
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:08,217
No, I understand.

138
00:12:08,957 --> 00:12:11,478
But you're one of those guys that actually does it.

139
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:12,479
That's all I'm saying.

140
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,839
You actually do it.

141
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,621
You don't talk about it, never say a word about it, but you do it.

142
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:22,124
So the next question, Rick, that I have for you,

143
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,086
You know, a lot of talk about zoning.

144
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:30,610
It's every place you go, every year you go for a cup of coffee, everyone is talking about the zoning.

145
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:35,814
You know, people would love to hear your position on it.

146
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:48,043
Well, my position is, it's been the same position that's always been from the day I was elected councilor back in 2011, is your job was to protect the neighborhoods.

147
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:51,587
And right now we're not doing that.

148
00:12:52,268 --> 00:13:04,398
And the reason for the uproar in the community is because we have touched the third rail of politics in the city is the residential housing areas.

149
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,102
There is really nothing wrong with our residential areas.

150
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:16,528
Maybe you can tweak it a little bit here and there, but the radical changes that have been proposed, I do not support them at all.

151
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:25,413
I know there's no there's no other answer of about you know That's the character of our community people moved here because they wanted a single-family house.

152
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:38,957
They wanted that backyard They didn't want a two-family or a three-family or four-family next door to them yeah, and listen if that's what you wanted there's areas of the city that have two and three families and That's where you move to but

153
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:48,400
Again, this is why we call it the third rail because you're proposing radical changes to small neighborhoods.

154
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,967
And again, I've heard from people say, we moved here from Somerville because we liked what we saw here.

155
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:57,688
We liked the communities.

156
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:01,652
We like our small house on our side street.

157
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:02,953
So that's really it.

158
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,795
I mean, and as far as,

159
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:11,577
I don't think that we worked enough on developing our commercial base.

160
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:16,619
When I first got elected to the council in 2011, our commercial base was at 22%.

161
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:22,983
John, I don't even think we're at 10% right now of commercial taxes.

162
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:31,268
And the commercial base helps offset the residential.

163
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:34,849
So we have these areas of the state.

164
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:38,373
Mystic Avenue has been talked about forever.

165
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:43,335
That should be the gateway to Medford, and it's not.

166
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:46,035
It's just, it's not what we want there.

167
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:46,315
It's a mess.

168
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:49,296
It's a mess, and it's been talked about forever.

169
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:59,319
Goes back before you and I, when we were little kids, there was talk about Tufts University taking it over, all kinds of stuff, but nothing has ever materialized on Mystic Avenue.

170
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:00,499
You have that whole

171
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:27,002
industrial district over by the the metal glen mall and all those side streets there where there is no more industry anymore that everything is like commercial and we're not taking advantage of that we've missed the boat i mean we you know we should have jumped on this in 2000 2001 two and three when interest rates were two and three percent right and at the

172
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:29,979
And I think that's where we missed the boat.

173
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:34,600
You know, we have all these small squares, and we're a unique community.

174
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:37,661
Do they need growth?

175
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:38,782
Yes, they do.

176
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:39,682
They need help.

177
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,202
But smart growth.

178
00:15:41,883 --> 00:15:43,463
Not 10-story buildings.

179
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:48,665
I go to other communities.

180
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:50,166
I see what other communities are like.

181
00:15:52,597 --> 00:16:00,320
Two, three and four stories is adequate for these West Medford Square, Ebby Salem Street, South Medford.

182
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:02,101
These are untapped.

183
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:13,206
Tufts Park, that whole street, right across the street there, that is a perfect development where there's a beauty salon and a cedar appliance.

184
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:15,247
You've got frontage, you've got everything.

185
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:19,249
And it's all a bunch of garages and untapped.

186
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:21,137
What's Method Square?

187
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:22,118
It's untapped.

188
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:27,380
Again, small, smart growth, not overgrowth.

189
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,181
And we talk about Method, even Method Square.

190
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:33,102
It's still the same.

191
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:38,724
People keep saying, I drive through and there's nothing happening.

192
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,385
So I'll give you a funny story.

193
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:44,346
My wife and I went out to dinner at Turner's and Melrose.

194
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:49,128
And as we're crossing the street, I asked my wife, I said, stop.

195
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,370
I says, tell me what you see.

196
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,411
She didn't understand what I was saying.

197
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:58,392
I says, look on both sides and tell me what you see.

198
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:03,353
I said, I see a friendly looking street.

199
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:06,913
It has trees on both sides.

200
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,073
It has lighting.

201
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:12,854
We have sign ordinance in the city that just ignore it.

202
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:15,215
I mean, the stores all look clean.

203
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:18,138
And that's really what it's about.

204
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:22,181
Again, we're not reinventing the wheel here.

205
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:27,125
Let's just say, people just got to stop and think.

206
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:31,568
We're giving this the rush that we don't need to be doing.

207
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:32,469
Let's think.

208
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,690
Other cities have done it.

209
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,311
It takes some time.

210
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:37,373
And when you want to rush it through,

211
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:39,794
Then you're going to get what you get.

212
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:41,714
We used to call it the bum's rush.

213
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:43,435
I didn't want to say that.

214
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:48,497
I'm going to say it because it is what it is.

215
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:53,138
Stop and think about what you're doing before you do it.

216
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,419
I also go to Melrose.

217
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,060
We go there for dinner once in a while.

218
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:05,823
And don't get me wrong, there's a lot of great restaurants in Medford now and everything else, but yeah, there's a lot that can be done, and it doesn't have to be overdone.

219
00:18:05,903 --> 00:18:06,384
It's curb appeal.

220
00:18:06,404 --> 00:18:10,365
Right, exactly, yeah, that's a big thing, yeah.

221
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:14,027
Melrose got it right, I have to say, downtown, they really do.

222
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:17,769
Okay, so let's get to the next question.

223
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,591
Another big event that happened recently was the overrides.

224
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:29,354
You know, we had two of the three pass.

225
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:33,057
It was a close decision, a very close decision, but they passed.

226
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:38,500
What was your feelings about the overrides?

227
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,823
My opinion is I did not support this override.

228
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,386
Not that the issues that were in it weren't important.

229
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:49,106
They were important.

230
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:49,326
Right.

231
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:58,708
For such a small amount of money, $7 million, I felt we wasted an override vote.

232
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:04,417
Because, and I told the present council there now, you know, coming down the line,

233
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:09,080
You have a potential of looking at an override for a potential high school.

234
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,942
You're probably going to need an override for a potential fire station, or maybe a couple other things.

235
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:19,663
That's what an override was meant for, for a large project like that.

236
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:25,545
For what we did an override for, I don't think it was the right decision, and I think we wasted

237
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:28,654
that opportunity for the ORICAs.

238
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:36,138
Now when you go back for your second crack at the apple, people can say, hey, you just hit me a few years ago for an override.

239
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:40,301
So I think it was a wasted opportunity for such a small amount of money.

240
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:43,643
But maybe an override is inevitable at some point.

241
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:48,905
I sense something brewing already with more overrides.

242
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:51,947
Overrides weren't meant to pay people.

243
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:52,487
No.

244
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:54,068
They were meant for larger projects.

245
00:19:54,188 --> 00:19:54,848
Right.

246
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:57,389
I agree.

247
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,090
We had money.

248
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,711
I thought it was just a waste for $7 million.

249
00:20:02,512 --> 00:20:04,193
I think a lot of people agree with that.

250
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:06,654
It wasn't the right time.

251
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:09,795
Like I said, I sense a lot more coming up the road.

252
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,357
It's not going to be easy.

253
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:14,018
It's just not.

254
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,902
But thank you for that answer.

255
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:21,487
So, you know, we're all aware of method needs.

256
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:32,870
Boy does method need more revenue sources So I you know, I guess As far as like, you know economic growth growing the tax base.

257
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:33,851
What do you think?

258
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:50,403
Well, as I mentioned before, you know the tech, you know, we were we had a lot higher Commercial base than we do now and it's gonna take it's gonna take a bit to get it back You know, some of it has gone from commercial to residential Yes, you get some of the money back but

259
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:56,926
We have so much potential for commercial development.

260
00:20:57,707 --> 00:21:07,849
And again, maybe we missed the boat on some of it, but I think we need to work harder to get it back.

261
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:17,132
One of my peeves with the city always has been that every time we talk about doing squares over this side,

262
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:22,870
We never go to the business owner first, because these are the people that actually own the property.

263
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:29,181
And we always take the public opinion, and everybody has great ideas on what to do with other people's property.

264
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:33,925
And I've always seen that as an issue.

265
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:40,847
Let's get the business owners and the property owners in a room, small sections at a time.

266
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:42,808
What can we do to help you?

267
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,229
Tell us what you want to do.

268
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:49,551
We'll give you the city's vision, tell us your vision, and maybe we can collaborate on something.

269
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:51,872
Maybe we can help you with some funding.

270
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:52,832
But let's...

271
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:57,895
Instead of, you know, let's say everybody wants a bakery in their community.

272
00:21:57,915 --> 00:21:59,596
Everybody wants a coffee shop in their community.

273
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:04,499
But let's talk to the business, the property owners themselves.

274
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,881
Let's see what we can do to help them.

275
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:09,202
Target an area at a time.

276
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:13,165
Like I said, we talked about that big piece in Salt River by Tuspac.

277
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:13,565
Right.

278
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:14,686
Great place.

279
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,447
That's perfect.

280
00:22:16,747 --> 00:22:17,367
Oh, yeah.

281
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:17,728
Great.

282
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:20,489
And I know the gentleman there has approached the city before.

283
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:24,024
It's gone nowhere.

284
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:27,686
West Medford Square, you have a parking lot there.

285
00:22:27,987 --> 00:22:29,187
You got spaces.

286
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:34,992
And we're wasting it on auto body shops and garages and things like that.

287
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,273
Prime for small development.

288
00:22:37,574 --> 00:22:38,995
Right down Main Street and Redding.

289
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:40,056
What do you see there?

290
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:44,199
You see apartments, four stories.

291
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,981
Not 10 stories like people.

292
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,902
That's overgrowth, overcrowding.

293
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:50,223
Those squares can't handle that.

294
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:57,404
Find what fits each area and let's work on that.

295
00:22:57,424 --> 00:23:00,406
I'd like to talk to the business owners.

296
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,067
We should talk to them first.

297
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:08,272
And I think that's one of the keys that's missing because that doesn't, it just doesn't seem to happen anymore.

298
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:10,554
I mean it did for a while but

299
00:23:12,355 --> 00:23:15,879
Boy, I agree with some of the stuff you're saying, especially with the squares.

300
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:21,324
So you don't need 400 units in Method Square to make it successful.

301
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:24,448
I mean, go up a couple of stories, whatever.

302
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:26,470
I think that's fine.

303
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:29,493
But anyhow, great answers.

304
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:31,635
I thank you for those.

305
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:31,695
OK.

306
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:37,801
So, you know, we've talked about quite a bit here.

307
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:44,333
You know, there's a lot of things that are...

308
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:56,719
you know, economic growth, the overrides, what's coming up the road, there seems to be a lot of important issues, a lot of concerns.

309
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:09,668
You talk to people, I talk to people, everyone I talk to, it's like, this election, it's like a huge one, and people are talking about a lot of different things in this.

310
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:14,711
I've never seen them talk like this before, but, so, if you could,

311
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:22,709
you know, give us an idea, you know, important issues, concerns.

312
00:24:22,749 --> 00:24:23,350
What do you hear?

313
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:23,890
Y'all are everywhere.

314
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,312
Okay, I got to tell you what I hear.

315
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:29,096
Probably one of the biggest issues right now is traffic.

316
00:24:30,057 --> 00:24:30,817
Traffic in the city.

317
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:33,760
I don't agree with some of the changes that we've made.

318
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,326
I know people call them traffic calming measures, but that traffic

319
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:49,691
they work total opposite, because now, I mean, where I live, High Street in the morning gets backed up past the Brooks School.

320
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:53,112
You can't get through the Winthrop Circle there because of the changes made.

321
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:56,774
Winthrop Street backs up to the high school.

322
00:24:58,434 --> 00:25:02,856
And on the other end, Winthrop Street backs up almost to Tufts in the afternoon.

323
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:06,097
Main Street is, you can't, we keep making the roads smaller.

324
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:09,378
People are under the guise that cars are going away.

325
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:10,787
They're not.

326
00:25:11,047 --> 00:25:16,770
I mean, I've talked to people that drive buses and trucks, they say, we can't navigate these streets anymore.

327
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:27,816
And you're causing accidents, and you're causing frustration of people that are sitting in this traffic, and now they're cutting onto all the side streets and causing havoc over there.

328
00:25:28,016 --> 00:25:32,639
So that's a giant issue in town.

329
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:40,023
As I mentioned before, one of my biggest peeves is the curb appeal of our city.

330
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:42,516
I don't like the curb appeal.

331
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:47,261
Route 16, the bypass has become a truck parking lot now.

332
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:51,365
And these are all people that have been kicked out of Everett and Chelsea.

333
00:25:51,686 --> 00:25:54,249
They're parking the truck.

334
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,234
My city is not a parking lot for these other communities.

335
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:23,187
the NSA it's it's it look it looks horrible and you know listen as always um the common thing you only get holes in the street we get miles and miles of streets and you know um the money that we get from from the state it obviously is not enough to do a street at a time we can only the budget we have um

336
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:25,589
is limited.

337
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:39,697
One of the things that when I was on the council before that Councilor Falco and myself came up with, we had met a company that comes in and grinds and repaves all in one throw.

338
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:48,402
And they had tried to come here to do a pilot program for a couple of streets for free to show you what they do.

339
00:26:48,943 --> 00:26:49,063
So

340
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:55,505
You can probably do two or three streets for the price of one and we never took advantage of it.

341
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:10,739
And I thought we should have, I'm not saying we do the main roads, but you get all these side streets that where you scrape them, and instead of giving it back to the company that turned it back in the time, they did it right on the spot.

342
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,720
Right, now I hear you, yeah, I remember.

343
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,724
And you know, let's say, you know, sidewalks, yes, we've done a lot of sidewalks over the last few years.

344
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:21,596
It never stops.

345
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:23,418
You could do sidewalks forever.

346
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:30,623
Having a full time sidewalk crew, something that I've advocated for since day one.

347
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:35,888
Those are people, but people want to see more things.

348
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:37,349
Why aren't there more restaurants here?

349
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:43,659
I mean, we have Shavire Auditorium.

350
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:46,021
We're not capitalizing on it.

351
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:47,802
They do a great job there.

352
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:50,725
I mean, listen, last night, the place was packed.

353
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:52,967
And those restaurants depend on that.

354
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:53,648
Yes, they do.

355
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:54,428
They depend on those.

356
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:55,770
We need more.

357
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,111
We need more.

358
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:59,513
And we have to work with them.

359
00:27:59,793 --> 00:28:02,195
Let's work to pull them into the community.

360
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:02,596
Right.

361
00:28:02,956 --> 00:28:03,837
Go out and solicit.

362
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:04,537
Yeah.

363
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,960
I mean, we have so much untapped

364
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:08,213
potential there.

365
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:18,922
I mean, maybe, I don't know if you, when you watch some of the commercials, like the town of Marlboro, there's a commercial touting all the property they have.

366
00:28:19,502 --> 00:28:21,324
Let's get out there and sell ourselves.

367
00:28:22,925 --> 00:28:23,426
They get things.

368
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:25,187
We're five miles from Boston.

369
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:27,629
We should be booming.

370
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,251
Yes, we should be, yeah.

371
00:28:31,938 --> 00:28:34,099
So that's just my two cents on that.

372
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah, no, and I appreciate it.

373
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,783
And yeah, I agree with a lot of what you're saying.

374
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:47,685
I mean, it's the street appeal and we can go on and on.

375
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:49,765
We all know the sidewalks.

376
00:28:49,885 --> 00:28:53,447
I mean, there's gotta be a way to do it, yeah.

377
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:55,408
I've always been an advocate of,

378
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:58,482
putting on more code enforcement people.

379
00:28:58,762 --> 00:28:59,183
Right.

380
00:28:59,443 --> 00:29:01,844
And I'm not telling you to go out there and torture people.

381
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:02,245
Right.

382
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:08,509
But go around, you know, a couple of days a week and pick up the obvious stuff.

383
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:10,170
Right, common sense stuff.

384
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,552
The obvious stuff, you know, even if it's wrong.

385
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:16,295
Hey, Johnny, you know, I know you've been doing this for a while, but it's not right.

386
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:18,717
I'm going to give you 60 days, you know, clean it up.

387
00:29:18,817 --> 00:29:19,257
And so this way.

388
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:20,097
Get your act together.

389
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:20,998
And get your act together.

390
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:24,381
You know, like I say, we have a signed ordinance.

391
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:24,721
Yes.

392
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:25,722
And no one adheres to it.

393
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:28,526
And it cleans up the windows.

394
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:36,280
I know exactly what you're saying because I drive through the square a lot and I hear you.

395
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:37,703
And I don't know what...

396
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:43,254
I don't even want to get into up that circle, because I have to go there once in a while.

397
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:46,075
It just takes forever to go anywhere in Bedford now.

398
00:29:46,455 --> 00:29:47,335
All the time, though.

399
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,996
It's not like it used to be in the morning, some traffic.

400
00:29:50,376 --> 00:29:51,317
It's a constant.

401
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:52,697
Something's wrong.

402
00:29:53,837 --> 00:29:57,458
All the traffic calming measures we've made, they're really not.

403
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,420
I don't agree with some of them, and I think they need to be fixed to help

404
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,601
let the traffic flow a little bit.

405
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:05,982
Cars aren't going away.

406
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:07,243
Yeah, no, no.

407
00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:14,969
It's causing more stress for people, that's the way I, you know, I look at it anyhow, it's just stress.

408
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:21,373
And you want people to come here and build more, which is only gonna bring... More cars, more traffic.

409
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:25,736
People don't have two cars anymore, but people still own cars.

410
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:27,398
They still have to drive, they still get around.

411
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:28,979
One of the big things people forgot about

412
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:30,961
was these ridesharing services.

413
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:36,006
City of Medford gets paid for every rideshare that originates in Medford.

414
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:40,150
We have over a half a million rideshares that started in Medford.

415
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,133
That's a half a million cars that were never on these roads.

416
00:30:43,553 --> 00:30:45,395
And how do you think half of these people get back?

417
00:30:45,755 --> 00:30:47,917
So if a half a million take them out of here,

418
00:30:49,058 --> 00:31:00,547
If even half of them come back, and you remember, you're going to Winchester, you're going to Arlington, you're going to Malden, the ride share business is a giant, and these are people that aren't familiar with your roads.

419
00:31:01,107 --> 00:31:03,829
And they live and die by the ways.

420
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,132
And ways takes you off into the neighborhoods.

421
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:09,033
Right, no, I hear ya, I hear ya.

422
00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:16,218
All interesting, all interesting things, concerns, good ones.

423
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:18,927
They need to be addressed.

424
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:28,725
So I'm going to ask you this question, because this is one of those things, it irks me, and I know it irks a lot of other people.

425
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:31,966
I'm sure you've heard it too, the complaints.

426
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:38,868
People go to a council meeting, and they're doing whatever.

427
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:47,131
They're talking about all this stuff, and then they always, at the end of the night, at 10 o'clock, people have to work, whatever.

428
00:31:48,051 --> 00:31:50,914
That's when the important items come up.

429
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:56,419
If I told you how many people go to these meetings, what do you think?

430
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:06,109
Council meeting schedule, is it really serving the needs of the people, of the residents?

431
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:09,031
Is it doing what it's supposed to do, plain and simple?

432
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:09,351
No.

433
00:32:09,872 --> 00:32:14,875
And I'm on the record on voting against the current schedule.

434
00:32:15,015 --> 00:32:15,515
Yeah.

435
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:19,097
We have too many things going on, you know, permits and all the things.

436
00:32:20,618 --> 00:32:25,483
that you can't do in that shorter period of time.

437
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:29,868
There was no reason why we couldn't continue the weekly meetings.

438
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:34,473
People would say, well, you know, there's not enough stuff on them.

439
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:39,298
Granted, there were some meetings that were short, and hey, every now and then you get that short meeting.

440
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:46,109
And over the years, you got out there maybe 9.30, 10 o'clock on a late night.

441
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:57,000
But when you're dragging these meetings purposely into 10.30, 11 o'clock, I think that's done by design to frustrate people so they go home.

442
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,221
People have to go to work.

443
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:04,047
Nothing good gets voted on at 11 o'clock at night because you're tired, you've been there a long time.

444
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,642
you'll vote just to get out of there.

445
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:11,185
I mean, one of the current counselors complains about that all the time.

446
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:13,708
About being there all night.

447
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:14,629
Being there all night.

448
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:15,890
There's no need of that.

449
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:19,750
The current system before was working fine.

450
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,691
It was working perfect.

451
00:33:21,031 --> 00:33:24,073
All right, granted, during the summer it was a little quiet.

452
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:25,974
We only used to meet once a month during the summer.

453
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:26,374
That's right.

454
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:28,076
And if needed, we would add another meeting.

455
00:33:28,116 --> 00:33:32,439
But we would have subcommittee meetings before the meetings or on a Wednesday night.

456
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:33,399
That's it.

457
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:34,360
And that's when you did it.

458
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,421
Yeah.

459
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:43,646
Don't try to justify your job by adding on subcommittee meetings that don't need to be that long and that length.

460
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,539
and that active.

461
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,162
Yeah, the subcommittees is a whole nother conversation.

462
00:33:50,282 --> 00:33:57,087
If elected, that's one of the first things I propose going forward is going back to weekly meetings.

463
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:00,410
I think that's, I think that's, it's needed.

464
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,752
I mean, and you said meetings, you know, going to 11.

465
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:08,316
I know people that were up there at 1230 at night meetings are going on.

466
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:13,520
I mean, not that I haven't sat through some of them, but no, no, no, it's just, it's not fair to the people.

467
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:22,664
I mean, sometimes change can be good, but when they changed over that meeting schedule, people said this is not the way to go.

468
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:25,005
I think people were right.

469
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:28,227
They were complaining they were going to be shut out, and they've been shut out.

470
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,287
That's the way I look at it.

471
00:34:29,307 --> 00:34:34,930
So when this was voted on, the agreement was, if it's not working, we'll change it back.

472
00:34:34,971 --> 00:34:35,711
That never happened.

473
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:36,451
And it never happened.

474
00:34:36,912 --> 00:34:42,595
So trust me, that will be one of the first things I propose, is bringing it back to weekly meetings.

475
00:34:44,702 --> 00:34:49,904
Okay, so another and I'm glad you're answering some tough questions by the way.

476
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:50,925
No, listen, I'm into honesty.

477
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:51,965
No, I know you are.

478
00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:55,327
Maybe they're not politically correct, but they're honest.

479
00:34:55,367 --> 00:35:02,030
But you always were that's that's why you were on the council for all those years because you are you're an honest man.

480
00:35:04,512 --> 00:35:05,812
The revised city charter

481
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:09,068
It's going forward.

482
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,630
What do you think about that?

483
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:20,814
Is there anything... I mean, no one's going to agree with all of it, but what do you feel about the revised charter?

484
00:35:20,874 --> 00:35:24,515
Is there anything on there you really like, you don't like, you think it's good?

485
00:35:25,516 --> 00:35:27,817
Well, this is the will of the people.

486
00:35:28,317 --> 00:35:28,537
Right.

487
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:29,938
In the past,

488
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,844
This has been voted on, the charter has been voted on by the people.

489
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:41,710
You know, Milvern and Ron did a great job over two years getting the opinions of the people.

490
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,311
Hey listen, this is what the people want.

491
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:43,951
That's correct.

492
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,032
Do I agree with everything?

493
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:46,973
No, there's a couple things I don't agree with.

494
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:51,316
Especially some of the things that relate to the city council.

495
00:35:52,037 --> 00:35:53,658
City council does not need a staff.

496
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:54,659
No.

497
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:57,781
We shouldn't be reimbursed expenses.

498
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:58,161
Right.

499
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,803
people don't realize the implications.

500
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:05,206
But it's just

501
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:15,064
I support, I'm supporting it because this is what the people want.

502
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:16,605
You're right.

503
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:18,586
Do I love everything in there?

504
00:36:18,646 --> 00:36:19,086
No, I don't.

505
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:23,048
But let's say, but you know, some of the council stuff in there, I don't, you know, raises.

506
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:27,171
A lot of people don't know what's in there.

507
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:28,732
There's no need of us having a staff.

508
00:36:28,992 --> 00:36:30,333
There's no need of us getting a raise.

509
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:33,835
And there's no need of us expenses.

510
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:36,977
What if I put in $10,000 of expenses?

511
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:40,499
Who's going to say what expenses are?

512
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,440
No, I hear you, I hear you.

513
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,981
Who's gonna, how much staff?

514
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:46,223
Why does the city council need a staff?

515
00:36:46,323 --> 00:36:46,923
Yep, yep.

516
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:48,905
That's your job, you're getting paid.

517
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:50,466
You do your own work.

518
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:52,327
It's not my job to pass it off to other people.

519
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:57,411
Right, and I wanna remind everyone, that wasn't put in, that wasn't requested by the people.

520
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:58,291
That was added in.

521
00:36:58,311 --> 00:36:59,172
That was added in after.

522
00:36:59,232 --> 00:37:00,813
By our city council.

523
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:02,735
I just wanna make that perfectly clear.

524
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:08,459
I think Ron Milva and that whole group did a tremendous job

525
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,100
And they deserve credit for all the work they did.

526
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,361
They do.

527
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:18,844
And unfortunately, the city council did some things that I just think just shouldn't have done.

528
00:37:18,984 --> 00:37:19,404
That's all.

529
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:20,204
It shouldn't have been done.

530
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:22,005
And I thank you for bringing that up.

531
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:31,070
So let me ask you, I call it a personal question, but it really isn't.

532
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,490
We ask this of everybody, Rick.

533
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:40,825
You know, what are your least favorite and then give me your most favorite things to do in Medford?

534
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,527
Least and most favorite.

535
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:45,449
You know me, I'm a foodie.

536
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:47,871
Yeah, that's true.

537
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:50,253
I agree.

538
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,354
I enjoy going out to eat.

539
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:55,957
I wish we had some more options.

540
00:37:55,977 --> 00:38:01,201
I try to frequent all the Medford establishments and I do my best.

541
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,750
You know, I like being around town.

542
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:11,214
You know me, I hit the coffee shop scene every day here in the weekends.

543
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:12,115
I talk to people.

544
00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:13,036
Right.

545
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:14,277
You know, I shop locally.

546
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:19,540
I walk the streets and I try to do as much locally as I can.

547
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:19,861
Yep.

548
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:26,045
And I try to stay involved with what's happening and I'm there to help people that need help.

549
00:38:26,245 --> 00:38:26,466
Right.

550
00:38:26,926 --> 00:38:27,746
And you know why?

551
00:38:28,587 --> 00:38:31,768
I think I've done a good job at it, and I enjoy doing it for people.

552
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:32,968
You've done a tremendous job.

553
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:35,348
I enjoy helping people.

554
00:38:35,888 --> 00:38:38,209
That's what my dad, my parents told me.

555
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,869
That's how they brought me up, was to help people.

556
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:44,050
A lot of us were brought up like that, you know, to help other people.

557
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,170
And we do it quietly.

558
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:45,730
We do.

559
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,810
We do it quietly.

560
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:56,112
I'm glad you let some of it out, because you've done... Boy, we can go on and on on this show about what you've done.

561
00:38:56,857 --> 00:39:06,203
And I love the fact, I do, I always see you around, driving, I see you for coffee, you know, here and there, same thing.

562
00:39:06,823 --> 00:39:09,045
I don't know if I have a least favorite thing in the city.

563
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:18,691
I don't know what it is, I don't know what my, like I say, I try to stay positive on everything.

564
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:19,932
I don't know if I have a,

565
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,288
least least favorite thing to talk about yeah well I think I think you you know I mean I think some of the concerns

566
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:39,237
Maybe some of those are things, but the single out something.

567
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:40,878
I don't think I have anything.

568
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:41,298
That's fine.

569
00:39:41,438 --> 00:39:41,879
That's fine.

570
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:44,221
You gave us some good examples earlier.

571
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:46,202
All right.

572
00:39:47,003 --> 00:39:47,963
Last question.

573
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:52,226
What's coming up for Rick Caviello?

574
00:39:53,256 --> 00:39:55,518
And the other, you know, this is important too.

575
00:39:55,698 --> 00:40:00,383
How does someone, and I know everyone knows how to get in touch with you.

576
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:01,304
I really do.

577
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:04,927
I know that people know, because they're still getting in touch with you constantly.

578
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:09,912
But you know, what's coming up for you and how do people get in touch with you?

579
00:40:09,932 --> 00:40:14,196
So I'm having my one and only fundraiser.

580
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,965
which will be September 25th at Holwin on Middlesex Avenue.

581
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:23,909
Everyone is welcome to attend at six o'clock.

582
00:40:27,074 --> 00:40:27,935
How do you get in touch with me?

583
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:31,607
My phone number is given to everybody.

584
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:35,591
I have no problem giving anybody my phone number.

585
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:40,676
And my former counselors will tell you, Rick always answers the phone.

586
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:41,177
Yes you do.

587
00:40:41,217 --> 00:40:45,361
And I still continue to answer the phone and I'll come to your house anytime you ask me.

588
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:46,722
How do you get in touch with me?

589
00:40:47,603 --> 00:40:51,307
My phone number is 781-572-5410.

590
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:52,528
That's my number.

591
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:53,789
It's not a fake number.

592
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:54,129
Right.

593
00:40:54,149 --> 00:40:55,431
That's my number.

594
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:56,772
Call me anytime.

595
00:40:57,092 --> 00:40:57,913
I'll answer the phone.

596
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:00,676
If I don't answer, I promise I will call you back.

597
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,477
I know you will, yeah.

598
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:08,541
So, unlike all these younger kids, I don't have all these techie things.

599
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:10,363
I don't have 47 Facebook pages.

600
00:41:10,383 --> 00:41:16,967
I have an email address, which is rickcaraviello at gmail.com.

601
00:41:17,547 --> 00:41:18,848
And I do have an Instagram account.

602
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:19,769
I don't know what it is.

603
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:20,409
Wow!

604
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,931
You finally have an Instagram account!

605
00:41:22,971 --> 00:41:25,753
No, no, I've had the Instagram account, and I do have it.

606
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,881
I guess you can find it if you really want to find it.

607
00:41:31,581 --> 00:41:34,322
But I say, you know, I'm not a techie.

608
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:38,383
I don't, you know, most of my friends don't, aren't techies.

609
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:40,904
So, but I say, everybody knows where to find me.

610
00:41:40,944 --> 00:41:41,844
You see me everywhere.

611
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:45,305
And I say, when you call, I'll always answer you.

612
00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:47,706
I'll always answer the call, answer the phone for you.

613
00:41:49,664 --> 00:41:52,566
We're going to end the show on that.

614
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:53,907
I really want to thank you.

615
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:57,009
I think it was great to have you on the show.

616
00:41:57,029 --> 00:42:01,832
I think a lot of people in Method got to see another side of you.

617
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:06,295
And I thank you for being honest with your answers and forthcoming.

618
00:42:06,555 --> 00:42:10,458
Maybe my answers aren't politically correct, but a lot of times people will ask me a question.

619
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:14,341
I'll say, do you want the political answer or do you want me to give you the truth?

620
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:15,502
And I try to speak the truth.

621
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:22,025
Maybe I shouldn't speak the truth all the time, maybe I shouldn't give political answers, but that's just not me.

622
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:23,406
Yeah, you do the right thing, yeah.

623
00:42:24,026 --> 00:42:25,487
Sometimes the truth is not popular.

624
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:28,928
As Jack Nicholson said in the movie, some people can't handle the truth.

625
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:30,089
They can't handle it, yeah.

626
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:33,340
All right, well, I want to thank you, Rick.

627
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,940
Thank you, John.

628
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,280
I'm so glad you came on the show.

629
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:35,701
I really am.

630
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:36,321
Thank you for having me.

631
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:41,222
And thank the residents of Medford that support this station and support what you do.

632
00:42:41,403 --> 00:42:41,803
Thank you.

633
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:42,483
I appreciate it.

634
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:45,224
I want to thank you for your hard work and all your staff that you have.

635
00:42:45,264 --> 00:42:45,484
Thank you.

636
00:42:45,504 --> 00:42:49,505
I don't know if people know, but this is all, you know, everyone that works here is a volunteer.

637
00:42:49,745 --> 00:42:50,326
Right.

638
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:53,487
And I hope, I voted for the funding.

639
00:42:54,207 --> 00:43:00,391
when we did this some years ago to get this studio up and to get the science labs up and our robotic labs and everything.

640
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:08,716
This section of the building shows what you can do without tearing the whole building down.

641
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:09,217
That's right.

642
00:43:09,457 --> 00:43:10,277
I agree with you.

643
00:43:10,758 --> 00:43:12,279
Oh boy, do I agree with you.

644
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:12,579
Yeah.

645
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:21,145
Yeah, we've been in the studio for a little while now and it's something else, this whole The Vogue section, it's incredible.

646
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:25,969
We had a show about The Vogue earlier.

647
00:43:26,029 --> 00:43:27,790
People want to come here to go to our Vogue now.

648
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,951
Yeah, no, it's pretty incredible and you're right.

649
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:31,873
And they say the kids do great work here.

650
00:43:33,594 --> 00:43:36,135
It's not the vocally, but it's technical school.

651
00:43:36,355 --> 00:43:39,837
But in our days, kids from this school didn't go to college.

652
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:41,078
These kids are going to college.

653
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,639
They're coming out here.

654
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:43,799
The union's in here with them.

655
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,361
They're getting degrees out of the technical school.

656
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:50,323
They're going on to careers that are relevant today.

657
00:43:50,783 --> 00:43:52,304
It's a lot of opportunity.

658
00:43:52,324 --> 00:43:53,084
Yes, a lot of opportunity.

659
00:43:53,104 --> 00:43:53,785
That's what it is.

660
00:43:54,805 --> 00:43:55,106
All right.

661
00:43:55,146 --> 00:43:56,107
Well, thank you, Rick.

662
00:43:56,648 --> 00:44:00,613
It is that time again, as I'm being told.

663
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:08,984
So I want to thank Rick Caviello first for joining us on Method Happenings.

664
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:11,206
And really, Rick,

665
00:44:13,746 --> 00:44:18,070
Thank you so much for being a candidate for the Meffitt City Council again.

666
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,472
This city needs you.

667
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:21,733
We really do.

668
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:23,415
It'd be nice to have you back up there.

669
00:44:24,556 --> 00:44:37,407
And before we close off, I want to let you know we are looking for some Meffitt residents to appear on a Meffitt Happening show to share their views

670
00:44:38,529 --> 00:44:43,785
on what they do expect from the members of the next city council.

671
00:44:45,693 --> 00:44:46,533
Very simple.

672
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:49,295
We'd like to hear your opinions.

673
00:44:49,915 --> 00:45:02,662
So if you're interested in doing a show like that, you can contact us at Method Happenings, 02155 at gmail.com.

674
00:45:03,923 --> 00:45:07,685
I also want to thank everyone who has been watching the show.

675
00:45:09,754 --> 00:45:12,496
It's growing, and thank you for your feedback.

676
00:45:13,136 --> 00:45:16,719
And that goes for both the positive and the negative.

677
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:19,381
And boy, it's been pretty positive.

678
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:20,401
We appreciate it.

679
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:30,008
You will be able to see replays of the show on the Method Community Media Channel Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 6 p.m.

680
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:30,929
or 7 p.m.

681
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:38,612
And I gotta tell you, you gotta go on a really, it's a great website.

682
00:45:39,413 --> 00:45:48,456
MedfordHappenings.com, and there is a lot of good information, things happening in Medford.

683
00:45:49,057 --> 00:45:50,797
There's some reviews on there.

684
00:45:52,718 --> 00:45:56,159
It's really a good website, and the amount of views,

685
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,681
that we're getting is telling us that we really did a good job with it.

686
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:03,182
We're very proud of it.

687
00:46:03,482 --> 00:46:04,422
You get a chance.

688
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:06,282
Take a look.

689
00:46:06,903 --> 00:46:12,464
And you can also find us on YouTube and on Facebook at Method Happenings.

690
00:46:13,664 --> 00:46:26,488
For the Method Happenings team, these guys that really do all the work, Paul, Marco, Bruce, Margaret, and James, I'm John Petrella.

00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,476
