    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=239.855s">Thank</a>  you And there's a lot more we can mention we won't but I know you've helped a lot of people Thank you that a lot of people don't even know about the things you've done Alright, so here's a good question for you Can you give us? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=256.885s">You</a>  know, a few reasons why you decided to run for a seat on the City Council again.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=263.21s">Well,</a>  the first reason is, you know, my love for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=268.954s">As</a>  you know, I've been off the council for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=272.637s">I</a>  ran unsuccessfully for mayor last semester. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=276.239s">I</a>  don't like <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=279.42s">the</a>  way that some of the community is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=281.601s">One</a>  of the big things that hurts me is the divide in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=286.783s">I</a>  feel that we should be more of a unified community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=289.104s">I</a>  don't like this us versus them mentality that's going around and all the things that get written on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=296.366s">We're</a>  one city, we're one community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=298.827s">Let's</a>  find common avenues and common bonds to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=305.72s">That's</a>  and that's part. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=306.561s">That's</a>  the big reason.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=307.422s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=307.682s">No,</a>  and I agree and that's a great reason because Like you I've been here most of my life and I've never seen it like this never with with the The division it's really bad and we need people You know, it's just not a local issue anymore.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=325.4s">It's</a>  become a national issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=326.862s">Yeah,</a>  I <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=327.682s">uh</a>  you know with with you know just a division of division in politics and it's it's not right uh the way it is you know um this is america and everyone is entitled to their opinion we don't have to agree with but this is what makes our country great is we can agree to disagree and still be friends at the end of the day yes i loved it when we had that yeah we would have some pretty good</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=349.229s">political</a>  talk, whatever, but after the talk, we were still friends, we still got along and everything else.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=355.939s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=356.62s">Yeah,</a>  it'd be nice to bring that back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=360.358s">All</a>  right, so that's a good reason, a really good reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=366.123s">You</a>  know, you've had a, we mentioned it, I mentioned it in the introduction, Rick. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=371.008s">You've</a>  done a lot for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=373.029s">You</a>  got a lot of accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=376.332s">Can</a>  you tell us, I mean, is there a few you could pick out that, you know, you're most proud of? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=382.278s">Things</a>  really that meant a lot to you.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=384.72s">Well,</a>  obviously, the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=387.643s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=389.185s">I</a>  worked on that for four years just to get them to come to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=394.011s">And</a>  I can't take all the credit for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=396.093s">You</a>  know, the administration takes credit because of the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=401.297s">With</a>  the library came, with that work came $12 million in upfront funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=407.04s">And</a>  I was also part of a foundation that helped raise over $6 million to sustain the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=413.664s">So</a>  I think the city got a pretty good deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=416.565s">We</a>  own a brand new library for not a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=419.907s">So</a>  I'm proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=421.668s">I</a>  was also upfront with Michael Marks in bringing the art center.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=426.691s">It's</a>  not about taking credit.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=428.432s">It's</a>  about getting the thing done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=429.913s">I</a>  was up front with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=440.217s">I</a>  was also both an executive director and president of the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=446.299s">Many</a>  people don't remember, when Cheryl White passed away during my term, I stepped into that office for a year and a half so we wouldn't lose our Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=457.041s">I've</a>  been heavily involved with the Kiwanis. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=460.442s">And</a>  some of the things I did with the Kiwanis, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=464.503s">I</a>  chaired the literacy program where we gave reading books to all first and third grade children in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=471.806s">I</a>  was on both the director and president of the Youth Hockey Association when we had almost thousands of kids there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=483.731s">I</a>  volunteer at the food bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=487.215s">You</a>  know, I'm where anybody asks me to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=491.357s">I</a>  fought with St. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=494.259s">Raphael's</a>  Food Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=496.2s">So</a>  I continue to stay involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=501.083s">Another</a>  thing I'm really proud of is my work with the veterans in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=506.906s">We</a>  had a... <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=508.667s">We</a>  had a request from a World War II veteran that hadn't been out of his house for a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=515.132s">And</a>  when we went over there, the wife says, well, why are you here? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=520.276s">I</a>  said, well, I thought you wanted a ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=522.078s">She</a>  says, no, we needed an elevator. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=525.0s">I</a>  said, well, it's not an elevator. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=526.942s">It's</a>  kind of a little bit out of my league, but I says, well, let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=532.066s">So</a>  I left. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=534.8s">And</a>  I called my go-to veteran, Don Marcelino.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=537.722s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=538.263s">I</a>  said, Don, I explained him what this problem was. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=540.144s">He</a>  said, well, let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=541.585s">He</a>  calls me back within an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=542.806s">He</a>  says, there's a lady that just bought a house that has an elevator. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=549.211s">They'd</a>  like to get rid of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=550.973s">And</a>  I said, oh, wow, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=552.173s">We</a>  went by there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=553.334s">I</a>  called the family back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=554.675s">He</a>  says, Merry Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=557.177s">We're</a>  going to install an elevator. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=559.079s">And</a>  I want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=560.915s">the</a>  Murphy brothers, for all their time and effort that they put into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=565.616s">And</a>  another one, we had a gentleman, a Vietnam veteran on Spring Street, had a paralyzed daughter, and daughter didn't have a bedroom or anything, and the people from Mill Creek stepped in and took her. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=583.871s">gave</a>  us probably over $200,000 in time and effort, and we redid a whole house for this man and his daughter, between bedrooms, showers, we got a hospital bed donated for her, a lift. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=599.493s">And</a>  I still, up to this day, I still do the food drive at Christmas and Thanksgiving for the veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=605.015s">So</a>  those are some of the things that, you know, even though I'm not involved, I still am involved with stuff.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=609.876s">You're</a>  very involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=611.077s">You</a>  can say all you want, you're not involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=613.157s">I</a>  know because, you know, I've known you for quite a while and I'm glad. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=620.099s">You</a>  know, guys like you don't get the credit they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=622.92s">That's</a>  the way I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=625.462s">There's</a>  a lot more things that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=627.762s">I</a>  know some of these people, and it means the world to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=630.984s">And</a>  I know someone else you got a ramp for, you played a big part of, and that was huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=636.546s">And,</a>  you know, I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=639.307s">And,</a>  you know, I look back at the library, and I always, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=644.009s">I</a>  mean what what you what what you do with the library and even with the arts I don't think people in Medford can really like understand or appreciate what really happened the work that went into it and I know Michael Marks uh had a lot to do with that the art center as well but you guys really got this all rolling and well John you know this comes with</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=698.104s">You</a>  know people that want to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=699.545s">That's</a>  what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=700.245s">You're</a>  a good guy and, you know, negotiating and everything else, you know, all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=705.607s">You're</a>  very experienced at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=709.188s">I</a>  can go on like this for a long time, but I know, you know, we're limited in time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=714.67s">But</a>  I want to personally thank you, and it's nice for the city to know, the people of the city to know.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=726.796s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=727.236s">No,</a>  I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=728.957s">But</a>  you're one of those guys that actually does it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=731.538s">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=732.519s">You</a>  actually do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=733.879s">You</a>  don't talk about it, never say a word about it, but you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=739.222s">So</a>  the next question, Rick, that I have for you, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=743.284s">You</a>  know, a lot of talk about zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=745.286s">It's</a>  every place you go, every year you go for a cup of coffee, everyone is talking about the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=752.572s">You</a>  know, people would love to hear your position on it.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=756.455s">Well,</a>  my position is, it's been the same position that's always been from the day I was elected councilor back in 2011, is your job was to protect the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=769.285s">And</a>  right now we're not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=772.268s">And</a>  the reason for the uproar in the community is because we have touched the third rail of politics in the city is the residential housing areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=786.74s">There</a>  is really nothing wrong with our residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=790.142s">Maybe</a>  you can tweak it a little bit here and there, but the radical changes that have been proposed, I do not support them at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=797.55s">I</a>  know there's no there's no other answer of about you know That's the character of our community people moved here because they wanted a single-family house. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=805.673s">They</a>  wanted that backyard They didn't want a two-family or a three-family or four-family next door to them yeah, and listen if that's what you wanted there's areas of the city that have two and three families and That's where you move to but <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=820.033s">Again,</a>  this is why we call it the third rail because you're proposing radical changes to small neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=828.44s">And</a>  again, I've heard from people say, we moved here from Somerville because we liked what we saw here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=836.227s">We</a>  liked the communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=837.728s">We</a>  like our small house on our side street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=841.712s">So</a>  that's really it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=843.053s">I</a>  mean, and as far as, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=846.774s">I</a>  don't think that we worked enough on developing our commercial base. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=851.977s">When</a>  I first got elected to the council in 2011, our commercial base was at 22%. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=858.621s">John,</a>  I don't even think we're at 10% right now of commercial taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=863.283s">And</a>  the commercial base helps offset the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=871.808s">So</a>  we have these areas of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=876.373s">Mystic</a>  Avenue has been talked about forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=879.534s">That</a>  should be the gateway to Medford, and it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=884.695s">It's</a>  just, it's not what we want there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=886.055s">It's</a>  a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=886.555s">It's</a>  a mess, and it's been talked about forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=889.596s">Goes</a>  back before you and I, when we were little kids, there was talk about Tufts University taking it over, all kinds of stuff, but nothing has ever materialized on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=899.699s">You</a>  have that whole <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=901.239s">industrial</a>  district over by the the metal glen mall and all those side streets there where there is no more industry anymore that everything is like commercial and we're not taking advantage of that we've missed the boat i mean we you know we should have jumped on this in 2000 2001 two and three when interest rates were two and three percent right and at the <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=927.938s">And</a>  I think that's where we missed the boat. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=930.239s">You</a>  know, we have all these small squares, and we're a unique community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=936.761s">Do</a>  they need growth? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=938.181s">Yes,</a>  they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=939.122s">They</a>  need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=940.142s">But</a>  smart growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=941.883s">Not</a>  10-story buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=943.603s">I</a>  go to other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=948.705s">I</a>  see what other communities are like. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=952.597s">Two,</a>  three and four stories is adequate for these West Medford Square, Ebby Salem Street, South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=961.101s">These</a>  are untapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=962.441s">Tufts</a>  Park, that whole street, right across the street there, that is a perfect development where there's a beauty salon and a cedar appliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=973.486s">You've</a>  got frontage, you've got everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=976.207s">And</a>  it's all a bunch of garages and untapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=980.317s">What's</a>  Method Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=981.217s">It's</a>  untapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=982.658s">Again,</a>  small, smart growth, not overgrowth. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=987.88s">And</a>  we talk about Method, even Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=992.442s">It's</a>  still the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=994.862s">People</a>  keep saying, I drive through and there's nothing happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1000.004s">So</a>  I'll give you a funny story. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1001.685s">My</a>  wife and I went out to dinner at Turner's and Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1005.186s">And</a>  as we're crossing the street, I asked my wife, I said, stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1010.11s">I</a>  says, tell me what you see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1012.791s">She</a>  didn't understand what I was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1014.871s">I</a>  says, look on both sides and tell me what you see. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1019.012s">I</a>  said, I see a friendly looking street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1024.453s">It</a>  has trees on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1027.293s">It</a>  has lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1029.494s">We</a>  have sign ordinance in the city that just ignore it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1033.295s">I</a>  mean, the stores all look clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1036.397s">And</a>  that's really what it's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1038.158s">Again,</a>  we're not reinventing the wheel here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1042.201s">Let's</a>  just say, people just got to stop and think. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1047.405s">We're</a>  giving this the rush that we don't need to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1052.009s">Let's</a>  think. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1052.709s">Other</a>  cities have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1054.05s">It</a>  takes some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1055.872s">And</a>  when you want to rush it through, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1058.613s">Then</a>  you're going to get what you get.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1060.374s">We</a>  used to call it the bum's rush. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1061.734s">I</a>  didn't want to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1063.915s">I'm</a>  going to say it because it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1068.617s">Stop</a>  and think about what you're doing before you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1074.239s">I</a>  also go to Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1075.459s">We</a>  go there for dinner once in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1078.16s">And</a>  don't get me wrong, there's a lot of great restaurants in Medford now and everything else, but yeah, there's a lot that can be done, and it doesn't have to be overdone. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1085.903s">It's</a>  curb appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1086.404s">Right,</a>  exactly, yeah, that's a big thing, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1091.026s">Melrose</a>  got it right, I have to say, downtown, they really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1095.268s">Okay,</a>  so let's get to the next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1099.61s">Another</a>  big event that happened recently was the overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1105.692s">You</a>  know, we had two of the three pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1109.715s">It</a>  was a close decision, a very close decision, but they passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1114.778s">What</a>  was your feelings about the overrides?</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1118.92s">My</a>  opinion is I did not support this override. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1124.924s">Not</a>  that the issues that were in it weren't important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1128.426s">They</a>  were important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1129.126s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1131.236s">For</a>  such a small amount of money, $7 million, I felt we wasted an override vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1139.609s">Because,</a>  and I told the present council there now, you know, coming down the line, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1145.259s">You</a>  have a potential of looking at an override for a potential high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1149.64s">You're</a>  probably going to need an override for a potential fire station, or maybe a couple other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1155.742s">That's</a>  what an override was meant for, for a large project like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1160.223s">For</a>  what we did an override for, I don't think it was the right decision, and I think we wasted <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1166.913s">that</a>  opportunity for the ORICAs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1168.714s">Now</a>  when you go back for your second crack at the apple, people can say, hey, you just hit me a few years ago for an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1176.158s">So</a>  I think it was a wasted opportunity for such a small amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1180.321s">But</a>  maybe an override is inevitable at some point.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1185.043s">I</a>  sense something brewing already with more overrides.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1190.426s">Overrides</a>  weren't meant to pay people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1192.187s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1192.527s">They</a>  were meant for larger projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1194.188s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1195.268s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1197.429s">We</a>  had money. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1198.59s">I</a>  thought it was just a waste for $7 million.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1202.512s">I</a>  think a lot of people agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1204.513s">It</a>  wasn't the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1207.034s">Like</a>  I said, I sense a lot more coming up the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1211.336s">It's</a>  not going to be easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1213.317s">It's</a>  just not. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1215.5s">But</a>  thank you for that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1218.243s">So,</a>  you know, we're all aware of method needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1222.822s">Boy</a>  does method need more revenue sources So I you know, I guess As far as like, you know economic growth growing the tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1233.31s">What</a>  do you think?</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1234.231s">Well,</a>  as I mentioned before, you know the tech, you know, we were we had a lot higher Commercial base than we do now and it's gonna take it's gonna take a bit to get it back You know, some of it has gone from commercial to residential Yes, you get some of the money back but <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1252.165s">We</a>  have so much potential for commercial development. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1257.707s">And</a>  again, maybe we missed the boat on some of it, but I think we need to work harder to get it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1269.33s">One</a>  of my peeves with the city always has been that every time we talk about doing squares over this side, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1278.082s">We</a>  never go to the business owner first, because these are the people that actually own the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1283.652s">And</a>  we always take the public opinion, and everybody has great ideas on what to do with other people's property. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1290.163s">And</a>  I've always seen that as an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1294.945s">Let's</a>  get the business owners and the property owners in a room, small sections at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1301.548s">What</a>  can we do to help you? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1303.068s">Tell</a>  us what you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1304.989s">We'll</a>  give you the city's vision, tell us your vision, and maybe we can collaborate on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1309.571s">Maybe</a>  we can help you with some funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1311.892s">But</a>  let's... <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1314.693s">Instead</a>  of, you know, let's say everybody wants a bakery in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1317.915s">Everybody</a>  wants a coffee shop in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1319.976s">But</a>  let's talk to the business, the property owners themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1324.96s">Let's</a>  see what we can do to help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1327.421s">Target</a>  an area at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1329.222s">Like</a>  I said, we talked about that big piece in Salt River by Tuspac. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1333.305s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1333.905s">Great</a>  place. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1334.766s">That's</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1336.747s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1337.387s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1337.788s">And</a>  I know the gentleman there has approached the city before. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1343.243s">It's</a>  gone nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1345.785s">West</a>  Medford Square, you have a parking lot there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1347.987s">You</a>  got spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1351.249s">And</a>  we're wasting it on auto body shops and garages and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1355.432s">Prime</a>  for small development. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1357.574s">Right</a>  down Main Street and Redding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1359.255s">What</a>  do you see there? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1360.176s">You</a>  see apartments, four stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1364.919s">Not</a>  10 stories like people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1367.241s">That's</a>  overgrowth, overcrowding. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1368.942s">Those</a>  squares can't handle that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1373.601s">Find</a>  what fits each area and let's work on that.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1377.424s">I'd</a>  like to talk to the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1380.446s">We</a>  should talk to them first. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1382.167s">And</a>  I think that's one of the keys that's missing because that doesn't, it just doesn't seem to happen anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1388.812s">I</a>  mean it did for a while but <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1392.355s">Boy,</a>  I agree with some of the stuff you're saying, especially with the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1395.939s">So</a>  you don't need 400 units in Method Square to make it successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1401.445s">I</a>  mean, go up a couple of stories, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1405.088s">I</a>  think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1408.192s">But</a>  anyhow, great answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1410.694s">I</a>  thank you for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1411.655s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1415.015s">So,</a>  you know, we've talked about quite a bit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1421.067s">You</a>  know, there's a lot of things that are... <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1426.632s">you</a>  know, economic growth, the overrides, what's coming up the road, there seems to be a lot of important issues, a lot of concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1437.259s">You</a>  talk to people, I talk to people, everyone I talk to, it's like, this election, it's like a huge one, and people are talking about a lot of different things in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1449.748s">I've</a>  never seen them talk like this before, but, so, if you could, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1457.143s">you</a>  know, give us an idea, you know, important issues, concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1462.749s">What</a>  do you hear? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1463.37s">Y'all</a>  are everywhere.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1463.95s">Okay,</a>  I got to tell you what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1465.512s">Probably</a>  one of the biggest issues right now is traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1470.057s">Traffic</a>  in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1471.858s">I</a>  don't agree with some of the changes that we've made. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1473.78s">I</a>  know people call them traffic calming measures, but that traffic <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1480.228s">they</a>  work total opposite, because now, I mean, where I live, High Street in the morning gets backed up past the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1489.931s">You</a>  can't get through the Winthrop Circle there because of the changes made. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1493.933s">Winthrop</a>  Street backs up to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1498.434s">And</a>  on the other end, Winthrop Street backs up almost to Tufts in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1503.156s">Main</a>  Street is, you can't, we keep making the roads smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1506.437s">People</a>  are under the guise that cars are going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1510.367s">They're</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1511.047s">I</a>  mean, I've talked to people that drive buses and trucks, they say, we can't navigate these streets anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1517.111s">And</a>  you're causing accidents, and you're causing frustration of people that are sitting in this traffic, and now they're cutting onto all the side streets and causing havoc over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1528.016s">So</a>  that's a giant issue in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1534.28s">As</a>  I mentioned before, one of my biggest peeves is the curb appeal of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1541.434s">I</a>  don't like the curb appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1543.376s">Route</a>  16, the bypass has become a truck parking lot now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1548.362s">And</a>  these are all people that have been kicked out of Everett and Chelsea. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1551.686s">They're</a>  parking the truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1555.05s">My</a>  city is not a parking lot for these other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1560.862s">the</a>  NSA it's it's it look it looks horrible and you know listen as always um the common thing you only get holes in the street we get miles and miles of streets and you know um the money that we get from from the state it obviously is not enough to do a street at a time we can only the budget we have um <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1585.129s">is</a>  limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1586.65s">One</a>  of the things that when I was on the council before that Councilor Falco and myself came up with, we had met a company that comes in and grinds and repaves all in one throw. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1600.278s">And</a>  they had tried to come here to do a pilot program for a couple of streets for free to show you what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1608.943s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1610.242s">You</a>  can probably do two or three streets for the price of one and we never took advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1617.47s">And</a>  I thought we should have, I'm not saying we do the main roads, but you get all these side streets that where you scrape them, and instead of giving it back to the company that turned it back in the time, they did it right on the spot.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1630.839s">Right,</a>  now I hear you, yeah, I remember.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1632.76s">And</a>  you know, let's say, you know, sidewalks, yes, we've done a lot of sidewalks over the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1641.016s">It</a>  never stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1642.217s">You</a>  could do sidewalks forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1644.779s">Having</a>  a full time sidewalk crew, something that I've advocated for since day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1651.744s">Those</a>  are people, but people want to see more things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1655.908s">Why</a>  aren't there more restaurants here? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1661.977s">I</a>  mean, we have Shavire Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1664.139s">We're</a>  not capitalizing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1666.721s">They</a>  do a great job there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1667.822s">I</a>  mean, listen, last night, the place was packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1671.105s">And</a>  those restaurants depend on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1673.107s">Yes,</a>  they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1673.668s">They</a>  depend on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1675.049s">We</a>  need more. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1676.51s">We</a>  need more. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1677.571s">And</a>  we have to work with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1679.793s">Let's</a>  work to pull them into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1682.355s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1682.956s">Go</a>  out and solicit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1684.317s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1684.958s">I</a>  mean, we have so much untapped <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1687.632s">potential</a>  there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1688.633s">I</a>  mean, maybe, I don't know if you, when you watch some of the commercials, like the town of Marlboro, there's a commercial touting all the property they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1699.502s">Let's</a>  get out there and sell ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1702.925s">They</a>  get things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1703.626s">We're</a>  five miles from Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1706.669s">We</a>  should be booming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1707.87s">Yes,</a>  we should be, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1711.938s">So</a>  that's just my two cents on that.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1714.159s">Yeah,</a>  no, and I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1716.64s">And</a>  yeah, I agree with a lot of what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1722.963s">I</a>  mean, it's the street appeal and we can go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1728.085s">We</a>  all know the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1729.885s">I</a>  mean, there's gotta be a way to do it, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1734.127s">I've</a>  always been an advocate of, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1736.961s">putting</a>  on more code enforcement people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1738.762s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1739.443s">And</a>  I'm not telling you to go out there and torture people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1742.005s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1742.285s">But</a>  go around, you know, a couple of days a week and pick up the obvious stuff.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1748.729s">Right,</a>  common sense stuff.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1750.23s">The</a>  obvious stuff, you know, even if it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1752.572s">Hey,</a>  Johnny, you know, I know you've been doing this for a while, but it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1756.535s">I'm</a>  going to give you 60 days, you know, clean it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1758.817s">And</a>  so this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1759.277s">Get</a>  your act together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1760.158s">And</a>  get your act together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1761.478s">You</a>  know, like I say, we have a signed ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1764.621s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1764.761s">And</a>  no one adheres to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1766.642s">And</a>  it cleans up the windows.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1769.307s">I</a>  know exactly what you're saying because I drive through the square a lot and I hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1776.901s">And</a>  I don't know what... <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1779.033s">I</a>  don't even want to get into up that circle, because I have to go there once in a while.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1783.434s">It</a>  just takes forever to go anywhere in Bedford now.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1786.455s">All</a>  the time, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1787.375s">It's</a>  not like it used to be in the morning, some traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1790.376s">It's</a>  a constant. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1791.857s">Something's</a>  wrong.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1793.837s">All</a>  the traffic calming measures we've made, they're really not. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1798.159s">I</a>  don't agree with some of them, and I think they need to be fixed to help <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1803.16s">let</a>  the traffic flow a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1804.961s">Cars</a>  aren't going away.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1806.002s">Yeah,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1807.783s">It's</a>  causing more stress for people, that's the way I, you know, I look at it anyhow, it's just stress.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1815.009s">And</a>  you want people to come here and build more, which is only gonna bring... More cars, more traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1821.433s">People</a>  don't have two cars anymore, but people still own cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1825.756s">They</a>  still have to drive, they still get around. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1827.438s">One</a>  of the big things people forgot about <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1829.499s">was</a>  these ridesharing services. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1831.541s">City</a>  of Medford gets paid for every rideshare that originates in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1836.366s">We</a>  have over a half a million rideshares that started in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1840.35s">That's</a>  a half a million cars that were never on these roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1843.553s">And</a>  how do you think half of these people get back? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1845.755s">So</a>  if a half a million take them out of here, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1849.058s">If</a>  even half of them come back, and you remember, you're going to Winchester, you're going to Arlington, you're going to Malden, the ride share business is a giant, and these are people that aren't familiar with your roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1861.107s">And</a>  they live and die by the ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1864.39s">And</a>  ways takes you off into the neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1867.212s">Right,</a>  no, I hear ya, I hear ya. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1871.735s">All</a>  interesting, all interesting things, concerns, good ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1877.843s">They</a>  need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1881.083s">So</a>  I'm going to ask you this question, because this is one of those things, it irks me, and I know it irks a lot of other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1890.026s">I'm</a>  sure you've heard it too, the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1893.867s">People</a>  go to a council meeting, and they're doing whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1899.008s">They're</a>  talking about all this stuff, and then they always, at the end of the night, at 10 o'clock, people have to work, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1908.051s">That's</a>  when the important items come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1911.434s">If</a>  I told you how many people go to these meetings, what do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1919.065s">Council</a>  meeting schedule, is it really serving the needs of the people, of the residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1926.369s">Is</a>  it doing what it's supposed to do, plain and simple?</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1929.191s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1929.872s">And</a>  I'm on the record on voting against the current schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1935.015s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1935.575s">We</a>  have too many things going on, you know, permits and all the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1940.618s">that</a>  you can't do in that shorter period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1945.623s">There</a>  was no reason why we couldn't continue the weekly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1950.689s">People</a>  would say, well, you know, there's not enough stuff on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1955.154s">Granted,</a>  there were some meetings that were short, and hey, every now and then you get that short meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1961.064s">And</a>  over the years, you got out there maybe 9.30, 10 o'clock on a late night. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1966.409s">But</a>  when you're dragging these meetings purposely into 10.30, 11 o'clock, I think that's done by design to frustrate people so they go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1977.28s">People</a>  have to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1978.902s">Nothing</a>  good gets voted on at 11 o'clock at night because you're tired, you've been there a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1986.14s">you'll</a>  vote just to get out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1987.662s">I</a>  mean, one of the current Councilors complains about that all the time.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1992.287s">About</a>  being there all night.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1993.868s">Being</a>  there all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1994.849s">There's</a>  no need of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1996.808s">The</a>  current system before was working fine.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=1999.77s">It</a>  was working perfect.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2001.031s">All</a>  right, granted, during the summer it was a little quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2004.113s">We</a>  only used to meet once a month during the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2005.994s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2006.475s">And</a>  if needed, we would add another meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2008.116s">But</a>  we would have subcommittee meetings before the meetings or on a Wednesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2012.639s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2013.539s">And</a>  that's when you did it.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2014.52s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2015.581s">Don't</a>  try to justify your job by adding on subcommittee meetings that don't need to be that long and that length. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2025.398s">and</a>  that active.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2026.759s">Yeah,</a>  the subcommittees is a whole nother conversation.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2030.282s">If</a>  elected, that's one of the first things I propose going forward is going back to weekly meetings.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2037.567s">I</a>  think that's, I think that's, it's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2040.55s">I</a>  mean, and you said meetings, you know, going to 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2044.613s">I</a>  know people that were up there at 1230 at night meetings are going on.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2048.456s">I</a>  mean, not that I haven't sat through some of them, but no, no, no, it's just, it's not fair to the people.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2054.459s">I</a>  mean, sometimes change can be good, but when they changed over that meeting schedule, people said this is not the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2062.904s">I</a>  think people were right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2065.045s">They</a>  were complaining they were going to be shut out, and they've been shut out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2068.267s">That's</a>  the way I look at it.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2069.307s">So</a>  when this was voted on, the agreement was, if it's not working, we'll change it back.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2074.971s">That</a>  never happened.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2075.791s">And</a>  it never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2076.912s">So</a>  trust me, that will be one of the first things I propose, is bringing it back to weekly meetings.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2084.702s">Okay,</a>  so another and I'm glad you're answering some tough questions by the way.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2089.924s">No,</a>  listen, I'm into honesty. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2091.025s">No,</a>  I know you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2091.985s">Maybe</a>  they're not politically correct, but they're honest.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2095.367s">But</a>  you always were that's that's why you were on the council for all those years because you are you're an honest man. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2104.512s">The</a>  revised city charter <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2108.088s">It's</a>  going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2112.59s">What</a>  do you think about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2113.691s">Is</a>  there anything... I mean, no one's going to agree with all of it, but what do you feel about the revised charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2120.874s">Is</a>  there anything on there you really like, you don't like, you think it's good?</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2125.516s">Well,</a>  this is the will of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2128.317s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2129.377s">In</a>  the past, <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2130.962s">This</a>  has been voted on, the charter has been voted on by the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2134.625s">You</a>  know, Milvern and Ron did a great job over two years getting the opinions of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2141.75s">Hey</a>  listen, this is what the people want. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2143.351s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2143.971s">Do</a>  I agree with everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2145.272s">No,</a>  there's a couple things I don't agree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2147.914s">Especially</a>  some of the things that relate to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2152.037s">City</a>  council does not need a staff.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2154.439s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2154.959s">We</a>  shouldn't be reimbursed expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2157.961s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2162.18s">people</a>  don't realize the implications. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2164.765s">But</a>  it's just <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2172.422s">I</a>  support, I'm supporting it because this is what the people want. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2176.264s">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2177.585s">Do</a>  I love everything in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2178.646s">No,</a>  I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2179.126s">But</a>  let's say, but you know, some of the council stuff in there, I don't, you know, raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2184.009s">A</a>  lot of people don't know what's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2187.211s">There's</a>  no need of us having a staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2188.992s">There's</a>  no need of us getting a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2190.733s">And</a>  there's no need of us expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2194.935s">What</a>  if I put in $10,000 of expenses? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2198.838s">Who's</a>  going to say what expenses are?</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2200.999s">No,</a>  I hear you, I hear you.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2202.7s">Who's</a>  gonna, how much staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2204.542s">Why</a>  does the city council need a staff?</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2206.323s">Yep,</a>  yep.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2207.504s">That's</a>  your job, you're getting paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2209.345s">You</a>  do your own work. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2210.486s">It's</a>  not my job to pass it off to other people.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2212.387s">Right,</a>  and I wanna remind everyone, that wasn't put in, that wasn't requested by the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2217.451s">That</a>  was added in. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2218.311s">That</a>  was added in after. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2219.232s">By</a>  our city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2220.893s">I</a>  just wanna make that perfectly clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2223.655s">I</a>  think Ron Milva and that whole group did a tremendous job <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2229.199s">And</a>  they deserve credit for all the work they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2232.12s">They</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2232.461s">And</a>  unfortunately, the city council did some things that I just think just shouldn't have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2238.984s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2239.464s">It</a>  shouldn't have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2240.224s">And</a>  I thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2244.366s">So</a>  let me ask you, I call it a personal question, but it really isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2251.09s">We</a>  ask this of everybody, Rick. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2254.2s">You</a>  know, what are your least favorite and then give me your most favorite things to do in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2262.326s">Least</a>  and most favorite.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2264.628s">You</a>  know me, I'm a foodie.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2265.809s">Yeah,</a>  that's true.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2268.231s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2270.393s">I</a>  enjoy going out to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2273.055s">I</a>  wish we had some more options. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2275.977s">I</a>  try to frequent all the Medford establishments and I do my best. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2282.648s">You</a>  know, I like being around town. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2286.371s">You</a>  know me, I hit the coffee shop scene every day here in the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2291.274s">I</a>  talk to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2292.295s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2293.076s">You</a>  know, I shop locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2295.297s">I</a>  walk the streets and I try to do as much locally as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2299.681s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2300.101s">And</a>  I try to stay involved with what's happening and I'm there to help people that need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2306.245s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2306.926s">And</a>  you know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2308.587s">I</a>  think I've done a good job at it, and I enjoy doing it for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2311.808s">You've</a>  done a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2313.028s">I</a>  enjoy helping people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2315.888s">That's</a>  what my dad, my parents told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2318.449s">That's</a>  how they brought me up, was to help people.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2481.33s">You</a>  finally have an Instagram account!</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2482.971s">No,</a>  no, I've had the Instagram account, and I do have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2488.54s">I</a>  guess you can find it if you really want to find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2491.581s">But</a>  I say, you know, I'm not a techie. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2494.402s">I</a>  don't, you know, most of my friends don't, aren't techies. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2498.443s">So,</a>  but I say, everybody knows where to find me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2500.944s">You</a>  see me everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2501.864s">And</a>  I say, when you call, I'll always answer you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2505.445s">I'll</a>  always answer the call, answer the phone for you.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2509.664s">We're</a>  going to end the show on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2512.726s">I</a>  really want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2514.527s">I</a>  think it was great to have you on the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2517.029s">I</a>  think a lot of people in Method got to see another side of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2521.852s">And</a>  I thank you for being honest with your answers and forthcoming.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2526.555s">Maybe</a>  my answers aren't politically correct, but a lot of times people will ask me a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2530.818s">I'll</a>  say, do you want the political answer or do you want me to give you the truth? <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2534.441s">And</a>  I try to speak the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2537.743s">Maybe</a>  I shouldn't speak the truth all the time, maybe I shouldn't give political answers, but that's just not me.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2542.045s">Yeah,</a>  you do the right thing, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2544.026s">Sometimes</a>  the truth is not popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2545.507s">As</a>  Jack Nicholson said in the movie, some people can't handle the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2548.948s">They</a>  can't handle it, yeah.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2551.479s">All</a>  right, well, I want to thank you, Rick.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2588.736s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2589.457s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2590.758s">Oh</a>  boy, do I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2592.359s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2594.36s">Yeah,</a>  we've been in the studio for a little while now and it's something else, this whole The Vogue section, it's incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2601.966s">We</a>  had a show about The Vogue earlier.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2630.783s">It's</a>  a lot of opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Rick Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2632.324s">Yes,</a>  a lot of opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/iM6Cr_t82ss&t=2633.104s">That's</a>  what it is.</p>
