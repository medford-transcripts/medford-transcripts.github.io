1
00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:03,211
do do

2
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:37,972
do do

3
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,652
Get it, honey, I can't provide.

4
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:11,593
The atmosphere is warm.

5
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,114
I want you to feel inside.

6
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:15,096
Don't want to be saying that you should've.

7
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:17,017
You got the flavor, I've got the sugar.

8
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:21,261
So would you get with the vibe, like when the jacks and fives hit?

9
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,524
Shake your body down to the ground, like this.

10
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:25,705
Shake me to the ground.

11
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:28,107
I'ma call you up, honey, please make it good.

12
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,213
Come on!

13
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:41,439
Down!

14
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:42,384
Yeah!

15
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,659
Our daughter, Jessie, loves playing detective.

16
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,560
A clue.

17
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,402
But since we discovered she has sensitive

18
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:11,327
do

19
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:27,675
Jim was at the laundromat when he heard, his ear said, maraca, senor, but his nose said, hey, freshest scent ever.

20
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:32,678
Following his nose, Jim found a man pointing scent beads into the washer.

21
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:35,880
The scent, the freshness, Jim blurted.

22
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,922
Sir, your scent maracas smell amazing.

23
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:42,204
You could call them scent maracas, but most noses call them.

24
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,049
I heard it was a good spot.

25
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,031
I don't know.

26
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:15,227
Yeah.

27
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:45,411
Okay.

28
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:14,240
It's not on the same list?

29
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,601
Okay, that's my bad.

30
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,238
Hello, good afternoon, everyone.

31
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:03,379
So happy to see you out here today.

32
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:06,619
The sky has really, really lightened up.

33
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,140
It's warm, but it's not hot.

34
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:13,303
It's a good day for jazz, don't you think?

35
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:15,544
Fantastic, fantastic.

36
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:19,545
All right, so let me just set the scene a little bit for you.

37
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,745
This is the West Medford Community Center, for those of you that don't know.

38
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:35,928
You're sitting in the historical heart of the African American community of West Medford, one of the oldest African American settlements, not only in Massachusetts, but in the country.

39
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:41,972
And I was born and raised in this community a few streets over.

40
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:45,074
I lived on Jerome Street first, and then I lived on Monument Street.

41
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:49,558
That park over there, Duggar Park, was where we played as kids.

42
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:56,503
And this building, the second building on the site, is where we did literally everything.

43
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,826
I learned how to make spaghetti here.

44
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:06,789
I learned how to build model cars here, just a whole list of things.

45
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:16,894
Now if you get a chance to go in, if you haven't been in before, go in because there's a lot of history on the walls and it's the history of a neighborhood.

46
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:24,878
And as with anything, change is the only constant.

47
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:29,880
So the neighborhood has changed pretty significantly from the time when I was

48
00:21:30,404 --> 00:21:32,944
you know, tooling around on those basketball courts over there.

49
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:39,566
I don't have the knees to do it anymore, so I'm gonna mind my business and stay over here where I'm in my element again.

50
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:42,406
But we have a nice program for you.

51
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:56,429
This is the Ally Project, and it is a conglomeration of four folks now, started out as two, myself and Jonathan,

52
00:21:57,757 --> 00:22:03,292
over here, we got together at what we like to refer to as the intersection of jazz and social justice.

53
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:06,902
We were both seeking something.

54
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:15,148
He was looking for kind of musical collaboration that spoke to the issues of the day.

55
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:25,336
And I was looking for an opportunity to take poetry and blend it with jazz and see what it would look like.

56
00:22:25,556 --> 00:22:31,481
So we met in a very, very congenial space and some good stuff has developed from it.

57
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,603
Our drummer, John Dalton,

58
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:41,579
came into the space as well.

59
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:43,100
He has his own music.

60
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,643
He does this really, really dynamic, progressive thing with a group called Spheres of Influence.

61
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:52,846
So before it's over, we'll have them here at the center playing as well.

62
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:56,228
And then Greg Turo here on the big sexy.

63
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,889
That's what I call his bass.

64
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:04,393
You know, Grey came into it at a very early stage as well.

65
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,194
And we've been a quartet now for a couple years, John?

66
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:09,534
A couple years now.

67
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:12,395
We have a CD that we've done.

68
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,336
We have them up on the porch there.

69
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:17,797
It's called the Ally Project.

70
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,437
It's $15.

71
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:21,878
If you got some money floating around, you want to hear some good music, go on and grab yourself.

72
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:24,258
I've got some books up there as well.

73
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:30,200
In case you were wondering what I am, I'm a poet.

74
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:32,563
That's what I do.

75
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:35,907
And I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan.

76
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:41,634
He's going to talk about our sponsors and give a few thank yous.

77
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:43,717
And then we're going to go on ahead and get started with the music.

78
00:23:46,877 --> 00:23:48,238
No, thank you very much, Terry.

79
00:23:48,978 --> 00:24:00,562
It's been a pleasure to work with this group for the past couple of years, especially in collaboration with this festival, which also started in 2020, which was not a great year for live music.

80
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:01,583
I'll just put it that way.

81
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,244
But it's gone from a virtual festival.

82
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:08,365
It's been five years now, actually, that we've been plugging away at this.

83
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:12,527
And the support, the community support has grown substantially in that time.

84
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,841
Before we get started, I just wanted to thank a couple of people that have made this possible.

85
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:32,992
First of all, a couple of individual sponsors this year, Susan Klein, Steve Shulman, and Ken Krause, as well as our Patreon members, who are people just, you know, people that love jazz and music and community events that have put in a couple dollars every month.

86
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:40,434
It's a subscription service, kind of like, you know, we all have too many subscriptions anyways, so why not add one more, you figure?

87
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:57,078
But it really adds up over time, and it allows us to sustain our jam session series and other events that happen over here at the community center, and now at Arts Collaborative Medford, where we were last night, which is a wonderful new space that will soon have lots of performing arts events there.

88
00:24:57,378 --> 00:25:01,639
So, that said, a couple of other people that have made this possible this year,

89
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,901
Thank you to Shayla, my partner Shayla.

90
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:11,189
I happen to be a little bit biased about how great a job she's done this year, but she is the one responsible for these beautiful programs.

91
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,713
So please feel free to take them and look through them.

92
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:22,743
And if you want any more information about particular artists, it is all in there along with links to websites and personal pages.

93
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:33,309
Also to, well, he isn't here today, but our friend Joe DeMore, who's done a lot of editing and has just built us our brand new website this year.

94
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:42,314
So even if you don't remember your program or it blows away in the wind, I don't know, you can access all of that on our website.

95
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:46,597
And soon we'll have a lot of video content for you.

96
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,229
MedfordJazzFestival.com, she's telling me to say.

97
00:25:52,030 --> 00:26:00,537
Speaking of media, Medford Community Media is here this entire weekend, thanks to Kevin Harrington.

98
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:13,828
And also, thanks so much to our sound department, which happens to be Avi Fagan over there, and his assistant, Gilel, as well, who's been helping out for the whole weekend.

99
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:18,775
Thanks also to our student volunteer, Eva Balo.

100
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:21,558
She's one of my piano students from Brandeis University.

101
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:23,560
Helped us set up a lot of things.

102
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,143
So it truly is an entire team of people, especially this year.

103
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:28,644
It grows a little bit each time.

104
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:44,270
Last, a couple of organizational sponsors to, first of all, where we've gotten some of our grants, Medford Arts Council, the Arts Alive Medford Foundation, Berkeley's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, who's responsible for the next group that you're going to hear after this.

105
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,451
Anastasia is an amazing piano player.

106
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,851
I've known her for several years.

107
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:50,212
And she's just doing some great things.

108
00:26:50,272 --> 00:26:51,772
So you're going to want to stick around for that.

109
00:26:52,642 --> 00:27:04,754
to the spaces that we're using this year, Arts Collaborative Medford, that art center from last night, for those of you who were there, and for this West Medford Community Center, which is just the perfect place to have this entire weekend in music.

110
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:16,279
Morningside Music Studio, also, to Members Plus Credit Union, Triangle Manor, who printed our beautiful t-shirts, another business right here in Medford.

111
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,479
So grab a shirt if you haven't already.

112
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:24,560
And to Nomen Copy and Print, too, which helped us out with these crisp-looking programs.

113
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:33,582
So with that said, I'll turn it back over to Terry, who's our poet and is going to kind of be the master of ceremonies here.

114
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,227
All right, let's get to it.

115
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,735
So I talked a little bit about the beginnings of this community.

116
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:52,161
And when we first started out, there were three streets.

117
00:27:52,841 --> 00:28:00,109
And this is after the Civil War, 1890s or so, when black folks first came to this area.

118
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:14,038
there were three streets that they could live on based on redlining and, you know, unspoken, unwritten covenants that were made by the city fathers that, you know, if there were going to be people of color here, this is where they were going to be.

119
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:19,821
So Jerome Street, Arlington Street, and Lincoln Street were the first three streets.

120
00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:25,605
And we were right by the Mystic River, and the Mystic River was no great shakes at that

121
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:26,926
point in time.

122
00:28:27,526 --> 00:28:29,907
It's much friendlier these days.

123
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:34,689
So we're going to start at the beginning with a piece called Hired by the Mystic.

124
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:43,053
They gave my people the lowlands and not much of it.

125
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:45,694
Just a few streets hired by the river.

126
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:49,756
Banks turned a blind eye behind the red lines.

127
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,881
And it wasn't about the money.

128
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:54,882
Class was an irresistible force.

129
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:58,703
Race was an immovable object.

130
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:16,631
Perhaps it wasn't a written rule, but white folks knew the legal tool to keep us in our space, in this mystic valley place, where slaves and rum and ships had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.

131
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,200
So it was hard by the mystic we went.

132
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,762
Muddy and a bit turned down.

133
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:30,546
The only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town.

134
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:32,227
But we named it.

135
00:29:32,968 --> 00:29:33,748
We claimed it.

136
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:35,709
We made it our own.

137
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:46,557
Even in the heat of summer when the shores were parched and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river.

138
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,766
We followed his flow to the lakes and the sandy beach front.

139
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:56,569
On our own Jordan shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ.

140
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:06,734
We caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teeming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed hard by the mystery.

141
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:11,478
We became community.

142
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:13,659
We commanded unity.

143
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,903
We embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go.

144
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:28,669
As the river ebbs and flows, the tides will turn and our fortune grows.

145
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:31,451
A few more streets become our home.

146
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:34,773
Houses on Sharon join kin on Jerome.

147
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:41,345
From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the white folks make more room for blacks.

148
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:43,747
The color line recedes a bit.

149
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:48,029
Church and school and center fit.

150
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,292
The bill becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shores.

151
00:30:54,553 --> 00:31:00,077
Now the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same.

152
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:08,935
Muddy Mystic most days is clean.

153
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,499
The banks are freshly cut and green.

154
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,347
Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town.

155
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:36,912
These streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines, condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, invest, and dispossess.

156
00:31:55,939 --> 00:32:00,383
Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city.

157
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:08,672
And sometimes success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan friends.

158
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:18,662
And yet, the river still turns and bends.

159
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:22,327
from where it begins to where it ends.

160
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:36,479
The only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town, where we named it and claimed it and made it our own.

161
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,863
All right, all right.

162
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:43,564
Okay.

163
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:45,446
All right.

164
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:57,463
All right, so that kind of establishes a little bit of a theme, and so we're gonna follow it just a little bit further with a piece we call Gentrified.

165
00:32:57,483 --> 00:33:11,988
Yeah.

166
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:48,399
See John Dalton back there, he's the soul of ingenuity with the paper, with the clothespins.

167
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,420
Yeah, man.

168
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:51,721
All right.

169
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:53,543
All right, we good?

170
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:55,224
All right, let's do it.

171
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:24,655
They talk about renovating, reimagining, and rehabilitating.

172
00:34:25,703 --> 00:34:29,947
They rave about new visions, new horizons, and new perspectives.

173
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:34,812
They revel in bistros, boutiques, and boulangeries.

174
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:37,694
They barely skip to the subway stations.

175
00:34:38,095 --> 00:34:39,916
They bike on the painted pathways.

176
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:43,039
They Uber and Lyft religiously.

177
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,524
Everything's on trend and on point and au pair.

178
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:52,744
They've codified the way we, they speak about what used to be.

179
00:34:53,805 --> 00:35:00,229
Urban blight, eyesores, drug dens, crack houses, tenements and slums, the ghetto.

180
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,012
They modify the way they speak about what we now see.

181
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:13,279
Makeovers, investment properties, B&Bs, brownstones, townhouses, condos, and co-ops.

182
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:23,027
Everything's vintage, bohemian, artsy, and retro, with creative green spaces and lofted open places.

183
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:44,736
Speculators bought lower than low, patiently waiting for the change, waiting for the junkies to move on, waiting for the squatters to give up, waiting for the black and the brown and the tan to fade.

184
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:52,036
They waited for the graffiti to erode.

185
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,837
They waited for the chain link to corrode.

186
00:35:55,378 --> 00:35:57,499
They waited for the families to implode.

187
00:35:57,899 --> 00:36:00,260
They waited for the prices to explode.

188
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,461
They waited and they calculated.

189
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:06,283
They waited as folks capitulated.

190
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:09,584
They waited as folks evacuated.

191
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:12,966
They waited as folks migrated.

192
00:36:18,004 --> 00:36:20,829
Then the realtors came and dispelled white folks' fears.

193
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,995
The architects came and re-engineered.

194
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:26,779
The designers came and changed the veneers.

195
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,226
The builders came and the new folk cheered.

196
00:36:37,091 --> 00:37:03,633
Now they've moved closer to work in the city, to quartz countertops that made kitchens pretty, to charter schools, nannies, and drivers, and bike frames made with carbon fibers, to Starbucks lattes and artisanal breads, and articulated sleep number beds, to million dollar urban show places, and fewer and fewer black and brown faces.

197
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:14,911
They showed us their heels when they took the white flight.

198
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:17,533
Then they crept back in in the dead of night.

199
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:21,476
With fat bank accounts, they were IPO wealthy.

200
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:25,579
Their move to displace was measured and stealthy.

201
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,523
All of the potholes now smoothly paved over.

202
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,806
Brown folks got schooled like a curry crossover.

203
00:37:34,466 --> 00:37:36,586
White folks doing a long-term sleepover.

204
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:40,867
Exclusive, obtrusive, extreme home makeover.

205
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:44,448
With a spoonful of sugar, they took all the clover.

206
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:50,549
Changing the context of neighborhood with subway tile and exotic wood.

207
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,370
Harlem, Detroit, and Chicago's South Side.

208
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,311
Boston's South End surely gentrified.

209
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:04,857
Emptied the church, emptied the steeple, now it's a spot for the chai-drinking people.

210
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:10,385
Took down the poles in the basketball hoops, now it's the park for the dog-walking troops.

211
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:15,932
No more wrecking community center, but a new parking lot for the monthly rental.

212
00:38:22,697 --> 00:38:24,979
Some folks hang on, but the die is cast.

213
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:27,820
The fire consumes and the torch is passed.

214
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:33,684
Invisible lines are drawn again, and folks can't buy when the banks won't lend.

215
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:41,365
Some folks keep their roots in the ground, but the waiting game is deep and profound.

216
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:45,989
They tour the streets noting history, yet what they want is no mystery.

217
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:57,439
Harlem, Detroit, and Chicago South Tide, a reoccupation is being applied to model cities that trickle down no longer suited to black and brown.

218
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:14,120
The urban sprawl that used to be the only homes we got to see is now the place for a growing infusion, is now the place that the gentry is choosing.

219
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:36,938
low rise projects slowly yield to equity building leases sealed to folks who came from far afield who won the fight when the poor folk appealed to lawyers and doctors and high tech heroes with trust fund ones and hedge fund zeros.

220
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:44,516
No preserving community, no real thought of legacy.

221
00:39:44,536 --> 00:39:50,197
A small plaque here, a street sign there, nothing that bronzes the atmosphere.

222
00:39:50,577 --> 00:39:58,219
Oakland, Brooklyn, and New Orleans, all made targets by whites with means.

223
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:03,540
Even in venerable Chocolate City, the news in the district inspires much pity.

224
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:11,723
killing the concept of neighborhood in ways they've never understood.

225
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:23,910
And now we witness the slow, painful slide as the village we built becomes gentrified.

226
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:30,453
All right.

227
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:32,194
OK.

228
00:41:33,948 --> 00:41:40,830
All right, so that's some of the intersection of jazz and social justice.

229
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:44,652
Let's rest on jazz for a little minute.

230
00:41:45,892 --> 00:41:49,954
We're going to do a piece called Reprise for Afro Blue.

231
00:41:50,714 --> 00:42:02,198
And Afro Blue song has been done by a lot of different folks, Herbie Hancock, more recently Robert

232
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:07,939
Yeah, Robert Glasper does a real nice version of it.

233
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,660
Erykah Badu actually sings on that version.

234
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:15,261
It's really, really nice.

235
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:17,262
But we like it.

236
00:42:17,722 --> 00:42:20,503
And so wrote a few little lyrics.

237
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:24,724
And we're just going to let the band do what the band does.

238
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:28,085
So this is Reprise for Afro Blue.

239
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:22,868
Dark is the mystery of the soul.

240
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:26,409
Drums are its heartbeat pole to pole.

241
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:33,812
Coated with roasted umber hue, coffee and caramel afro blue.

242
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:50,533
Pretty black boy, lovely brown girl.

243
00:43:51,014 --> 00:43:53,478
Glowing and glistening mother of pearl.

244
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,743
Surely the love is deep and true.

245
00:43:57,444 --> 00:44:01,070
Cobalt and indigo, afro blue.

246
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:20,700
The dawn of the first pink light reveals a smoldering kiss that the darkness conceals.

247
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:27,371
Coated with roasted umber hue, coffee and caramel afro blue.

248
00:44:57,213 --> 00:45:00,175
Soul beckons soul as the lovers embrace.

249
00:45:00,775 --> 00:45:04,197
Fire melts ice beyond time and space.

250
00:45:05,138 --> 00:45:08,020
Surely the love is strong and true.

251
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,403
Cobalt and indigo, afro blue.

252
00:46:20,919 --> 00:46:23,400
There is no misery in their song.

253
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,701
Heartbeats and rhythms solid and strong.

254
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,802
Coated with roasted umber, you.

255
00:46:30,422 --> 00:46:33,123
Coffee and caramel, afro blue.

256
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,044
Coated with roasted umber, you.

257
00:46:37,705 --> 00:46:41,426
Coffee and caramel, afro blue.

258
00:46:49,522 --> 00:46:55,048
John Dalton on drums, Greg Toro on bass, Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

259
00:46:56,809 --> 00:46:57,170
All right.

260
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:57,850
OK.

261
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:01,194
Yeah, let's do that.

262
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:11,979
So there are a few names in the jazz canon that are synonymous with excellence.

263
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,242
And like, if you're really into jazz, like these are folks that you just know, you just know them.

264
00:47:18,683 --> 00:47:24,646
Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk.

265
00:47:25,655 --> 00:47:33,482
So we're gonna do a piece, Jonathan and I, that's kind of a takeoff on the music of Thelonious Monk.

266
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:47,134
And if you know about Monk, genius, that's first thing, but led a very, very tragic life and relatively short-lived.

267
00:47:48,174 --> 00:47:51,157
So see if we can tell a little bit of a story.

268
00:47:59,926 --> 00:48:01,048
So,

269
00:48:20,427 --> 00:48:25,293
You were the mystic and the mage with every scribble on each lined page.

270
00:48:26,014 --> 00:48:30,981
So deadly serious at that bench with eyes ablaze and teeth in clinch.

271
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:38,350
Tones that spin discordant perfection, harmonic twists in every reflection.

272
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:44,125
What is the meaning of all this scatter as you summon rhythmic antimatter?

273
00:48:44,945 --> 00:48:50,607
Why must you rage and violently pound each key to achieve such a potent sound?

274
00:48:51,267 --> 00:48:56,288
Reveling in a cerulean funk, you were the least obedient monk.

275
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,129
Sometimes you wax melodic and quiet.

276
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:04,290
Then you revert to the din of a riot.

277
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:12,618
Every chord with a stranglehold on conventional music centerfold.

278
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:17,180
A bit of the Duke's panache in style with James P. Johnson's strident guile.

279
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:23,042
Yours were the most ambitious spirit in every bar the night can hear it.

280
00:49:26,866 --> 00:49:29,167
The grand piano majestically sits.

281
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:31,909
It has no sense of the crimes it commits.

282
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:37,112
It tolerates explosive bits of cosmic slop as the maestro sits.

283
00:49:40,216 --> 00:49:45,080
in a soft felt fez or a pork pie hat, you are a different kind of cat.

284
00:49:45,641 --> 00:50:02,216
Fingers like Harlem stickball bats, scurrying quick like tenement rats, over those keys while the saxophone scats, over those keys while the drummer pats, over those keys with sharps and flats, while the bass man thumbs out welcome mats in front of the door of Handy and Fats.

285
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:05,379
Real conversation, not idle chats.

286
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:11,022
Wed to the notes like a pretty young wife.

287
00:50:11,443 --> 00:50:15,708
You brought jazz piano back to life and made the music cut like a knife.

288
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:18,472
Skipping chords and dissonant strife.

289
00:50:18,913 --> 00:50:21,477
Never to march like a drum and fife.

290
00:50:21,697 --> 00:50:23,760
With crackling sparks, your soul was rife.

291
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:33,125
Yet waves of sickness embrace your spirit.

292
00:50:33,886 --> 00:50:36,188
The music allowed you to hardly hear it.

293
00:50:37,089 --> 00:50:39,312
Oceans of darkness and you didn't fear it.

294
00:50:39,893 --> 00:50:42,536
A constant hurdle, we watched you clear it.

295
00:50:44,801 --> 00:51:01,143
Or rather we listened in special awe As camels buckled with every star You piled on top of harmonic law As bop and stride made doubters thaw You'd ever succumb to a tragic flaw And be undone by depression's claw

296
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:10,672
So still the vinyl adorns the platter as we revel in musical anti-matter.

297
00:51:11,512 --> 00:51:16,795
Madame Panonica's lilting splatter round midnight with a truly, truly mad hatter.

298
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:30,942
Solitude embraces a tortured soul that scales the peaks of an opposite pole through a Thorazine haze that takes control and still the maestro maintains control.

299
00:51:32,196 --> 00:51:38,080
The Steinway bursts in dynamic tone, and yet the madness won't leave him alone.

300
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:46,527
The abbot cowers and refuses to pray as the musical friar prepares to slay.

301
00:51:48,248 --> 00:51:54,553
The Steinway engages in mythical work while legions of demons quietly lurk.

302
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:03,374
ready to take the altar away to assault the monk as we hear him play.

303
00:52:09,937 --> 00:52:10,317
Thank you.

304
00:52:11,218 --> 00:52:11,618
Thank you.

305
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:13,579
All right.

306
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:21,343
So there are a few folks here, not many, a few folks here who are going to know exactly what I'm talking about.

307
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:32,285
But the beauty of this thing is that for the rest of you, even if you don't know about my situation, you're going to be able to wed it to your situation.

308
00:52:32,765 --> 00:52:35,686
That's the beauty of community-based poetry.

309
00:52:36,506 --> 00:52:39,166
So this is called The Little Store.

310
00:52:45,027 --> 00:52:45,148
Me?

311
00:52:47,348 --> 00:52:47,448
OK.

312
00:52:51,249 --> 00:52:53,990
It was a tiny red hovel on Upper Jerome.

313
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:57,411
A bit run down and rough around the edges.

314
00:52:58,491 --> 00:53:01,672
And Mr. Henry seemed so old to us.

315
00:53:02,452 --> 00:53:07,313
Even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient, and a little scary.

316
00:53:08,914 --> 00:53:11,375
One would suspect that he didn't even like kids.

317
00:53:12,695 --> 00:53:14,435
But he really must have loved us.

318
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:19,617
Or else, where did all that penny candy come from?

319
00:53:20,717 --> 00:53:21,657
He had all of it.

320
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:23,178
No, seriously.

321
00:53:24,298 --> 00:53:29,040
We'd bust in there with a few nickels or a handful of copper, all loud and unruly.

322
00:53:31,581 --> 00:53:35,183
He'd hush us up while he finished with grown folks' business.

323
00:53:35,943 --> 00:53:39,324
Then he'd be back, like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack.

324
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:44,646
He'd peer over those old horn-rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day.

325
00:53:45,566 --> 00:53:49,248
Then he'd blow open one of those small brown craft paper bags.

326
00:53:50,737 --> 00:53:57,464
and get to stuffin' while we were oohin' and ahin' and huffin' and puffin'.

327
00:53:57,624 --> 00:54:04,771
See, Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.

328
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:16,456
root beer barrels and pixie sticks, squirrel nut zippers and banana splits, green mint juleps and button strips, red licorice ropes and bottle nips.

329
00:54:16,996 --> 00:54:25,326
He had bazooka Joe bubble gum and a tiny sucker called a dum-dum, jawbreakers and tootsie rolls.

330
00:54:25,946 --> 00:54:28,269
Sugary love for little kid souls.

331
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:33,454
Candy necklaces to wear and bite and waxy red lips with such a sight.

332
00:54:33,894 --> 00:54:38,279
Fat gum cigars and kid cigarettes right beside the crunchy six-lets.

333
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:43,164
Mary Jane chewies and BB bats, hot fireballs and Mexican hats.

334
00:54:43,484 --> 00:54:46,227
Just the genuine Hershey's kisses.

335
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:49,009
All of the hits and none of the misses.

336
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,371
Like Kit, taffy squares, and Necco wafers.

337
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,833
Liquor made in Boston baked beans.

338
00:54:55,313 --> 00:54:58,294
Gold rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag.

339
00:54:58,755 --> 00:55:01,456
A kid's idea, sweet tooth swag.

340
00:55:03,037 --> 00:55:07,059
Before the days of Laffy Taffys, we would gobble up peppermint patties.

341
00:55:07,419 --> 00:55:12,182
Before we knew about gummy bears, Twizzlers always came in pairs.

342
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,644
Chewy cow tails had a creamy filling, but sugar babies had top filling.

343
00:55:18,044 --> 00:55:22,509
Reese's peanut butter cups had us squealing like newborn pups.

344
00:55:23,049 --> 00:55:27,553
Mikey Nikes and orange slices, saltwater taffy and tiny prices.

345
00:55:28,214 --> 00:55:33,599
Lifesavers and charms and fruity flavors, we grabbed those bags like potty favors.

346
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:39,007
Chuckles were a favorite choice, and Milk Duds made us all rejoice.

347
00:55:39,427 --> 00:55:44,190
Jolly Ranchers and Bitter Honey, we always got a lot for our money.

348
00:55:50,253 --> 00:55:52,034
Talk about kids getting excited.

349
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:54,436
You can't imagine the flame he ignited.

350
00:55:54,876 --> 00:55:59,939
Our greedy fingers could barely wait to take that candy like fish take bait.

351
00:56:03,063 --> 00:56:09,206
From cold January to chilly December, more kinds of candy than I can remember.

352
00:56:09,226 --> 00:56:15,089
At the Ville storefront on Upper Jerome, I knew I had to write this poem.

353
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:23,793
See, Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.

354
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:38,225
So you see, you know, everybody in their own way, own neighborhood, bodega, whatever, can relate.

355
00:56:39,386 --> 00:56:42,108
Because every community had a Mr. Henry in a little store.

356
00:56:42,868 --> 00:56:43,249
Okay.

357
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:44,810
All right.

358
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,671
So, yeah.

359
00:56:54,657 --> 00:56:55,277
Where is it?

360
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:55,958
Oh, here it is.

361
00:56:58,797 --> 00:56:59,157
OK.

362
00:57:01,438 --> 00:57:09,781
Again, what we began doing when we got together, Jonathan and I, is figuring out how we could tell some stories.

363
00:57:10,641 --> 00:57:14,842
And so that's what the endeavor has been all about.

364
00:57:15,603 --> 00:57:17,643
At the soul of it is telling stories.

365
00:57:18,204 --> 00:57:22,505
So this piece is called Legacy, and it'll come to you.

366
00:58:06,556 --> 00:58:08,898
It's not for you to tell your own story.

367
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,881
That is the burden of your children.

368
00:58:12,802 --> 00:58:15,925
They must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty.

369
00:58:16,966 --> 00:58:23,133
And yet, you have not gathered them up and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders.

370
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:29,319
You have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their name.

371
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,821
How will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk?

372
00:58:34,682 --> 00:58:39,466
How will they learn to tell your stories even as they live out their own?

373
00:58:48,853 --> 00:58:59,162
Sons and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the ash burning or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know.

374
00:59:00,836 --> 00:59:08,218
If you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's earthy reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know.

375
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:19,061
If mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark, and stoke the flames, you don't know.

376
00:59:21,022 --> 00:59:27,764
And until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride stories, the hunters will always tell them first.

377
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:38,606
The good book says train up the child in the way they should go.

378
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:50,500
Will we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on a hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace?

379
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:55,665
Will we not show them Anansi's clever ways?

380
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:05,999
Popo and Fafida's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda and Songololo's new tackies.

381
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:16,669
The prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return.

382
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:28,397
But how will they know the way home if no map charts the scenes, measures the roads, cites the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening trees?

383
01:00:34,442 --> 01:00:37,765
Will the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children?

384
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,067
Will they care to carry?

385
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:42,669
Will they dare to tarry?

386
01:00:44,076 --> 01:00:45,838
Will they linger at the foot of the griot?

387
01:00:45,878 --> 01:00:49,041
Will they hunger for the wisdom of the sage?

388
01:00:50,603 --> 01:01:03,557
We must put them on the page, where hard work earns a man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, where miracles scoff at the wand of a mage.

389
01:01:05,285 --> 01:01:16,110
We must share with them this truth that is loyal and fierce like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional booth, that has the bite of the panther's tooth.

390
01:01:27,465 --> 01:01:35,048
This is a gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captives free, and a candle's light beckons liberty.

391
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:49,032
Sons and daughters and heirs, I bid you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength.

392
01:01:50,939 --> 01:02:05,029
They will show you Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fathina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Songololo's new tackies.

393
01:02:14,108 --> 01:02:16,214
Soon you will be the herald.

394
01:02:16,876 --> 01:02:19,723
Write these things down on the tablets of your spirit.

395
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:22,390
Let them put a running in your feet.

396
01:02:30,683 --> 01:02:35,426
With each quickening step you repel the arrows of the hunter with the shield of abiding faith.

397
01:02:35,946 --> 01:02:39,508
You capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils.

398
01:02:39,908 --> 01:02:45,551
You remain the lions of the pride and your tails will always be your children's bread.

399
01:02:56,929 --> 01:03:15,354
You will never abandon the community of faith, though you build a thousand cities on a hill, drawing wondrous strength from the master's touch, as the oil of his anointing fills your clay jars with his grace.

400
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:21,395
Thank you.

401
01:03:22,896 --> 01:03:23,296
Thank you.

402
01:03:27,984 --> 01:03:38,349
I am, in my estimation, probably the luckiest poet I know because I get to play with these guys.

403
01:03:38,509 --> 01:03:44,592
And I didn't, when I started writing poetry and I've been doing it, publishing poetry for

404
01:03:46,135 --> 01:03:53,297
let's see, first book in 2010, so almost 15 years now, and I've been writing poetry, you know, really for as long as I can remember.

405
01:03:55,317 --> 01:04:09,841
But, you know, had I not met Jonathan, I don't know if I would have gotten to this place, this intersection of jazz and social justice and poetry, and I'm really, I'm very thankful and somewhat humbled by it.

406
01:04:12,745 --> 01:04:17,310
Thanks, John D. Thank you, Greg T. Thank you, Jonathan.

407
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:18,631
All right.

408
01:04:20,132 --> 01:04:20,553
OK.

409
01:04:21,674 --> 01:04:22,034
All right.

410
01:04:22,515 --> 01:04:22,815
All right.

411
01:04:23,155 --> 01:04:28,401
So we really, really want this thing to work for everybody.

412
01:04:28,461 --> 01:04:32,525
That's part of why we came together, because we wanted to

413
01:04:33,993 --> 01:04:42,644
espouse the finer virtues of what we believe that this country honestly can be if it finds the fundamental soul of its people.

414
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:48,893
And its people are from everywhere, every part of the globe.

415
01:04:50,254 --> 01:05:05,206
every, you know, haunt and haven, and we bring them here and we harbor them, and if we do it the right way, then what we end up with is a wonderful melting pot and a blissful soup of diversity.

416
01:05:05,806 --> 01:05:12,752
So, this is for the search for that beloved country, and that's what it's called, Beloved Country.

417
01:05:23,422 --> 01:05:23,498
you

418
01:05:57,228 --> 01:05:58,549
I can love this country, too.

419
01:05:58,569 --> 01:06:01,833
I didn't have to be born on these barney shores.

420
01:06:01,993 --> 01:06:06,117
I didn't have to be a son of the Pentacook, Quinnipiac, or Mohican.

421
01:06:06,978 --> 01:06:11,422
I didn't have to have a pilgrim pedigree or be a Connecticut Yankee from King Arthur's Court.

422
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:18,329
I can be the Dahomian, the Pole, or the child of Caribbean suns and Amazon shades.

423
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,932
I can love this country, too.

424
01:06:21,012 --> 01:06:24,958
My green card was a welcome ticket to a new life in a new land.

425
01:06:25,879 --> 01:06:28,783
My passport was stamped with new hopes and new dreams.

426
01:06:29,204 --> 01:06:34,552
My suitcases were packed full with new aspirations and some apprehensions, too.

427
01:06:37,697 --> 01:06:46,705
Perhaps I didn't see the harbor sign that said, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuge of your teeming shore.

428
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:49,447
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.

429
01:06:49,648 --> 01:06:52,270
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.

430
01:06:53,211 --> 01:07:01,158
Perhaps I didn't see the lady in the lamp, but I did see the gleaming city on a hill that couldn't be hid, and my soul responded.

431
01:07:04,651 --> 01:07:05,952
I can love this country, too.

432
01:07:05,972 --> 01:07:09,993
I can love its rolling meadows and its gospel songs.

433
01:07:10,573 --> 01:07:14,335
I can love its asphalt highways and its born-to-run boss.

434
01:07:14,975 --> 01:07:17,816
I can love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

435
01:07:17,836 --> 01:07:24,398
I can love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

436
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,841
But can America love me, too?

437
01:07:34,281 --> 01:07:37,503
Can she love my hijab and henna tattoos?

438
01:07:38,063 --> 01:07:40,984
Can she love my Hajj, my Mecca, and my Medina?

439
01:07:41,565 --> 01:07:45,366
Can she love my Cinco de Mayo and my Dia de los Muertos?

440
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:49,548
Can she love my kente cloth, dreads, twists, and locks?

441
01:07:50,069 --> 01:07:58,573
Can she love the skin I'm in, be it ebony, ivory, dulce de leche, or cafe au lait?

442
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:04,330
Can she love me by name?

443
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:13,762
Shekinah Glory, Muhammad Bin Saeed, Anastasia Kozov, Cleophis Dorcio, Claudia Gonzalez.

444
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:16,386
Can she love me by name?

445
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:29,064
And what if I am among those huddled masses in that wretched refuge or that homeless, tempest-tossed?

446
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:32,206
Will she still continue to lift her lamp?

447
01:08:36,548 --> 01:08:50,996
Or do war and rumors of war, IEDs, sleeper cells, and faith distortions make me a pariah to be eliminated, a scourge to be annihilated, and a plague to be exterminated?

448
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,461
I come in peace.

449
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:03,326
I love this country too.

450
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:05,867
I love its boundless opportunity.

451
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:08,108
I love its generosity of spirit.

452
01:09:08,509 --> 01:09:10,730
I love the audacity of its hope.

453
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:14,192
I love its rolling meadows and its joyful songs.

454
01:09:14,412 --> 01:09:18,655
I love its asphalt highways and its little red Corvette.

455
01:09:19,702 --> 01:09:22,327
I love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

456
01:09:22,968 --> 01:09:28,077
I love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

457
01:09:58,012 --> 01:10:01,293
I come in peace, and I love America too.

458
01:10:07,676 --> 01:10:08,156
All right.

459
01:10:09,236 --> 01:10:09,596
All right.

460
01:10:09,856 --> 01:10:15,118
OK, so we're going to take that equation, and we're going to flip it around a little bit.

461
01:10:15,898 --> 01:10:19,820
And what you're going to end up with is a piece called Alienation.

462
01:10:49,889 --> 01:10:54,351
I'm gonna flip the script again.

463
01:10:56,072 --> 01:10:56,452
Okay.

464
01:10:59,693 --> 01:11:01,294
So as I was saying a little bit earlier,

465
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:12,306
John Dalton, one of the really fine drummers in this area, has a couple of different projects that he's working with.

466
01:11:12,366 --> 01:11:14,308
And one of them is called Spheres of Influence.

467
01:11:15,048 --> 01:11:22,554
And one of the pieces that he composed is called Justice.

468
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:26,758
And when I heard it, I said, well, you know, you got to write poetry for that.

469
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:30,581
You can't have justice walking around without no poetry.

470
01:11:31,101 --> 01:11:33,083
So I wrote this piece called Justice.

471
01:11:33,837 --> 01:11:43,086
And we're going to play that because I want to highlight the excellent work that John is doing in his own right.

472
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:27,042
The streets call out no justice, no peace.

473
01:12:27,442 --> 01:12:29,543
When will the war against black folks cease?

474
01:12:30,504 --> 01:12:35,687
When will you say a farewell to arms and finally yield to equality's charms?

475
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:43,188
When will the wounds that run blood red no longer mean that a brown boy is dead?

476
01:12:46,349 --> 01:12:49,971
The state of the nation is vile and rank, retching with bile, who do we thank?

477
01:12:50,411 --> 01:12:55,534
Political discourse fails to achieve any good hope that our hearts can conceive.

478
01:12:55,994 --> 01:12:59,156
Block by block, there's fire and smoke.

479
01:12:59,616 --> 01:13:02,818
Society smolders, it's chaos, it's broke.

480
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:09,241
Piles of dreams just rot and congeal.

481
01:13:09,641 --> 01:13:11,642
A sting the children will always feel.

482
01:13:11,722 --> 01:13:14,823
This kind of justice is hardly blind.

483
01:13:15,203 --> 01:13:17,764
It makes no mention of good or kind.

484
01:13:18,204 --> 01:13:21,605
We know too well why you strangle our vote.

485
01:13:21,745 --> 01:13:24,646
We tear down the fences and fill in the moat.

486
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,229
Freedom delayed is just us denied.

487
01:13:29,689 --> 01:13:31,769
We watch the hollow point bullets glide.

488
01:13:31,809 --> 01:13:36,430
It ain't no magic carpet ride, no handsome groom and pretty bride.

489
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:43,492
Toward the abyss we quickly slide amid the mounting genocide, amid the stain of racial pride.

490
01:13:43,872 --> 01:13:48,934
Our precious liberty shoved aside, scorn at every tear that's cried.

491
01:13:49,294 --> 01:13:51,995
You called us brother and sister.

492
01:13:52,535 --> 01:13:53,195
You lied.

493
01:13:57,782 --> 01:13:59,423
critical theories of racial hate.

494
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:06,125
You won't let them penetrate the fundamental institution without swift blows of retribution.

495
01:14:06,765 --> 01:14:11,326
You bought the founder's constitution without the price of restitution.

496
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:21,490
You won't let children hear the truth for fear that they will become like Ruth, for fear that they will face their kings and gain the courage that freedom brings.

497
01:14:24,301 --> 01:14:27,165
The streets now edge toward riot and rage.

498
01:14:27,205 --> 01:14:35,556
You'd loose the hatred from every cage and soon erase from every page any white fault for slavery's wage.

499
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:41,384
You'd hide the truth of God's own gage, but he sees every play you stage.

500
01:14:47,947 --> 01:14:52,411
You will not swallow any pill that codifies a supremacist will.

501
01:14:53,192 --> 01:14:56,455
Instead, you seek to normalize a sovereign right to sanitize.

502
01:14:56,495 --> 01:14:58,917
You hold no right self-evident.

503
01:14:59,237 --> 01:15:01,219
Accept your rights to own, not rent.

504
01:15:01,299 --> 01:15:03,061
Accept your rights to every cent.

505
01:15:03,261 --> 01:15:05,483
Accept your rights to close the tent.

506
01:15:05,643 --> 01:15:08,766
Accept your choice to not repent.

507
01:15:27,901 --> 01:15:31,203
The streets call out, no justice, no peace.

508
01:15:32,004 --> 01:15:34,545
We pray for redemption, we crave release.

509
01:15:35,226 --> 01:15:41,530
We hope against hope for every child that urban streets become less wild.

510
01:15:46,193 --> 01:15:53,918
And the gaping wounds that run blood red don't again mean that a brown boy is dead.

511
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:53,991
So back in the day, when James Brown was doing a concert, he'd say, give the drummer some.

512
01:19:16,846 --> 01:19:18,246
All right, give the drummer some.

513
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:21,667
All right, all right.

514
01:19:23,927 --> 01:19:24,707
Two more, okay.

515
01:19:25,507 --> 01:19:25,848
All right.

516
01:19:29,148 --> 01:19:30,128
Tell me a bedtime story?

517
01:19:30,668 --> 01:19:31,609
Okay, all right.

518
01:19:34,389 --> 01:19:37,409
Yeah.

519
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:41,190
Little scared of dragonflies, I'm sorry about that.

520
01:19:43,431 --> 01:19:45,691
Yeah, I am a little scared of dragonflies.

521
01:19:49,463 --> 01:19:57,606
All righty, okay, so we're gonna go back and do another nice little jazzy piece for you.

522
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:07,710
Another piece that we know at least that Herbie Hancock and Quincy Jones have done.

523
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:13,433
It's called Tell Me a Bedtime Story, and so we've taken it to a slightly different place.

524
01:20:13,733 --> 01:20:16,874
This is called Tell Me Another Bedtime Story.

525
01:21:08,285 --> 01:21:11,005
Is this where the sandman picks up each grain?

526
01:21:12,026 --> 01:21:14,866
Restoring the beauty, reducing the pain.

527
01:21:16,147 --> 01:21:22,008
Is this where we fly to never, never land like a troop of lost boys with Peter Pan?

528
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:31,251
All of the mystery of hidden dreams.

529
01:21:32,811 --> 01:21:34,452
Nothing now is as it seems.

530
01:21:35,342 --> 01:21:41,105
Tell a sweet tale that sugars and creams with flashes of stardust and shining moonbeams.

531
01:21:43,227 --> 01:21:51,431
As I lay down to my slumber, paint a landscape of ochre and umber, let there be a hint of romance.

532
01:21:52,352 --> 01:21:53,473
Turn up the quiet.

533
01:21:54,113 --> 01:21:55,454
Love wants to dance.

534
01:22:17,352 --> 01:22:35,391
Tell me a bedtime story, please, of secret gardens and pecan trees, of babbling brooks and waterfalls, of giant gentle breezes that summer calls, of hidden havens and wondrous places, of astral planes and mystical spaces.

535
01:22:54,815 --> 01:22:58,698
Let there be a melody that sings in four-part harmony.

536
01:22:59,339 --> 01:23:03,802
Let it resound in symphony, then fold into dreamland's reverie.

537
01:23:05,123 --> 01:23:15,532
Tell me a fable of Arabian lights sped on the table of earthly delights, free from the label of anger and fights, willing and able to scale higher heights.

538
01:23:25,782 --> 01:23:46,930
Tell me a bedtime story now, as the baby rocks in the maple bough, as the blue ox puts his nose to the plow, and the sweaty farmer wipes his brow, as each green seedling happily vows to yield each fruit the ground allows, and seven dwarfs whistle a happy tune, and sleeping beauty awakens soon.

539
01:23:56,542 --> 01:24:00,391
Let there be a melody that sings in four-part harmony.

540
01:24:01,293 --> 01:24:06,484
Let it resound in symphony, then fold into dreamland's reverie.

541
01:24:18,567 --> 01:24:31,179
This is the time when the sandman whispers and seven grooms meet seven sisters and the prairie sings an ode to love as angels release the turtle dove.

542
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:39,847
For now I lay me down to sleep and pray to God my soul to keep.

543
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,263
Okay.

544
01:25:04,027 --> 01:25:04,308
Okay.

545
01:25:10,879 --> 01:25:23,889
Again, part of the rationale for doing this is to kind of bring people together in a place and a space that they all recognize, no matter where they're from, no matter what they do, no matter who their people are.

546
01:25:25,731 --> 01:25:38,501
And this piece that we're gonna end with represents that coming together that every family has as part of their history and part of their legacy.

547
01:25:38,521 --> 01:25:39,322
This piece is called

548
01:25:39,722 --> 01:25:41,262
kitchen table poem.

549
01:25:50,705 --> 01:25:52,446
Nobody ever wants to leave.

550
01:25:54,046 --> 01:25:59,848
They're like the blueberry stains on mama's apron, settled and satisfied.

551
01:26:00,814 --> 01:26:07,437
Good food has been eaten, fresh corn and collard greens, fried chicken and potato salad.

552
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:10,659
Bellies are fat and full.

553
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,520
This is that room.

554
01:26:14,821 --> 01:26:18,343
Oh my God, and girl, and are you serious right now?

555
01:26:19,183 --> 01:26:19,963
It's real talk.

556
01:26:20,544 --> 01:26:21,424
We're real people.

557
01:26:22,085 --> 01:26:23,485
Family, you know what I'm saying?

558
01:26:24,286 --> 01:26:24,926
We're family.

559
01:26:27,455 --> 01:26:30,298
You can smell the love long before the door opens.

560
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:36,786
You know there's going to be pecan pie and the sweet tea will be ice cold.

561
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:41,452
Southern folk will slip out of their northern nests.

562
01:26:41,752 --> 01:26:46,338
Accents will thicken and the country shade will feel closer to the city sun.

563
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:49,702
and they'll stay at that table.

564
01:26:50,383 --> 01:26:58,252
Long after the crumbs are cleared, the dishes will be all washed, the food will be put away or packed in Tupperware and Ziploc totes.

565
01:26:59,974 --> 01:27:03,198
Everybody will have a doggie bag and a story to tell.

566
01:27:05,168 --> 01:27:13,011
The men will be playing bitter, slapping down dominoes, sipping on a little something something, and talking big trash.

567
01:27:13,652 --> 01:27:18,394
The smiles will be broad, and the laughter will be contagious.

568
01:27:19,454 --> 01:27:22,115
The women will be fanning and fussing.

569
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:25,057
Good lord, she know she too big for that dress.

570
01:27:25,697 --> 01:27:27,678
That ain't no Sunday saved outfit.

571
01:27:28,178 --> 01:27:29,779
That's for Saturday night sinning.

572
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:31,139
You know I'm right.

573
01:27:31,599 --> 01:27:32,840
Girl, you know I'm right.

574
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:36,521
Nobody ever wants to leave.

575
01:27:37,521 --> 01:27:43,305
They're like black Jesus's eyes on that old wall hanging, loving and insistent.

576
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,846
Soul food has been shared.

577
01:27:46,547 --> 01:27:50,569
My gene has prayed down heaven and the baby sang their song.

578
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:55,332
Everyone's trickled and tranquil.

579
01:27:57,414 --> 01:27:58,895
This is that room.

580
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:02,357
I really, really miss Pap.

581
01:28:03,996 --> 01:28:05,977
Is baby boy's cancer in remission?

582
01:28:07,197 --> 01:28:11,499
And when you coming back to church, it's real talk.

583
01:28:12,439 --> 01:28:15,160
We're real people, family.

584
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:16,621
You know what I'm saying?

585
01:28:17,321 --> 01:28:19,382
We're family.

586
01:28:21,223 --> 01:28:23,504
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

587
01:28:27,865 --> 01:28:28,305
All right.

588
01:28:29,506 --> 01:28:32,007
Once again, Johnny Dalton on drums.

589
01:28:33,584 --> 01:28:35,526
Greg Toro on the big bass.

590
01:28:37,107 --> 01:28:39,068
Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

591
01:28:39,989 --> 01:28:40,890
I'm Terry Cotter.

592
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:42,351
We are the Ally Project.

593
01:28:44,264 --> 01:28:45,165
Thank you very much.

594
01:28:45,545 --> 01:28:46,906
So we're going to take a break.

595
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:51,728
There'll be another group coming along shortly.

596
01:28:51,748 --> 01:29:12,421
And if you've heard the name and know the fame, Terry Lynn Carrington, who is an eminent professor of music at Berklee now, but has also been a Grammy Award winning drummer that has traveled literally all over the world and played with the best.

597
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:16,323
best that jazz has to offer.

598
01:29:16,963 --> 01:29:25,308
She has an institute called the Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice, and she's sending a group here to play for us.

599
01:29:25,908 --> 01:29:33,733
They were here doing one of our jazz jams, and as the old heads would say, young cats, but they could play.

600
01:29:34,713 --> 01:29:35,554
They could really play.

601
01:29:36,147 --> 01:29:37,728
So they'll be along shortly.

602
01:29:38,069 --> 01:29:39,290
We have refreshments.

603
01:29:41,091 --> 01:29:43,974
Go over to the table and get some snacks.

604
01:29:45,275 --> 01:29:48,017
Maybe a t-shirt will perk your interest.

605
01:29:48,037 --> 01:29:52,561
You can go upstairs and check out the books and the CDs.

606
01:29:52,981 --> 01:29:56,805
Restrooms are in the main room on the left.

607
01:29:57,285 --> 01:30:01,589
There's two of them halfway down and then two thirds of the way down.

608
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:10,185
Thank you for your attentiveness, thank you for your appreciation of this great music, and we'll see you in a little bit.

609
01:37:27,388 --> 01:37:28,489
Downey rinse and refresh.

610
01:41:31,233 --> 01:41:33,149
We took a whole summer song and remixed it

611
01:44:09,705 --> 01:44:09,787
you

612
01:46:05,751 --> 01:46:05,811
do

613
01:47:25,558 --> 01:47:25,941
Bye!

614
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:52,440
Are you looking for tasty and easy summer meals?

615
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:55,841
Check out our website for quick recipes and shopping tips.

616
01:47:56,141 --> 01:47:57,862
Add in the fruits and vegetables you love.

617
01:47:58,222 --> 01:47:59,663
Find the perfect recipe for summer.

618
01:49:33,729 --> 01:49:33,811
you

619
01:50:19,006 --> 01:50:19,191
you

620
01:50:59,885 --> 01:51:08,530
Okay, okay, I'm almost done.

621
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:12,232
Don't discuss this without me.

622
01:51:12,412 --> 01:51:14,273
No forcing discussion.

623
01:51:14,354 --> 01:51:17,695
Have you seen Kind of Kindness?

624
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:18,256
No spoilers.

625
01:51:18,396 --> 01:51:19,797
No spoilers.

626
01:51:19,817 --> 01:51:22,578
Malibu, man, is like obsessive.

627
01:51:22,658 --> 01:51:23,119
Really?

628
01:51:23,239 --> 01:51:23,619
Yeah.

629
01:51:36,644 --> 01:51:37,484
do do

630
01:52:39,349 --> 01:52:39,550
Bye!

631
01:53:12,768 --> 01:53:13,229
Yeah.

632
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:11,938
A little more of myself.

633
01:54:11,958 --> 01:54:14,200
I don't have a control on it.

634
01:55:01,176 --> 01:55:01,398
you

635
01:58:48,788 --> 01:58:51,070
No, no, no.

636
01:58:52,631 --> 01:58:53,111
Thanks for calling.

637
01:58:54,071 --> 01:58:54,332
Really?

638
01:58:54,792 --> 01:58:59,234
Well, the way it's printed, it's really confusing.

639
01:58:59,254 --> 01:59:02,997
Okay, that's good feedback for them, yeah.

640
01:59:03,237 --> 01:59:04,818
Oh, wow.

641
01:59:05,658 --> 01:59:06,219
Oh, okay.

642
01:59:06,559 --> 01:59:09,941
Because it's at Thurning-Harrington Institute of Justice and Injustice.

643
01:59:20,272 --> 01:59:25,381
Yeah, I don't know where she went.

644
01:59:28,346 --> 01:59:28,947
She's inside.

645
01:59:29,188 --> 01:59:29,688
She's inside?

646
02:00:58,251 --> 02:00:58,331
Yeah.

647
02:02:06,132 --> 02:02:06,532
Yeah.

648
02:02:31,493 --> 02:02:31,653
th th th

649
02:07:27,594 --> 02:07:28,715
Yeah, so I'm happy about that.

650
02:07:28,815 --> 02:07:29,615
I'll tell you something.

651
02:07:29,755 --> 02:07:30,775
It's in Belmont.

652
02:07:30,855 --> 02:07:32,136
It's Powers Music School.

653
02:07:32,196 --> 02:07:32,996
Awesome, awesome.

654
02:07:33,076 --> 02:07:36,098
Yeah, so it's like double my pay that I was going to do.

655
02:07:36,178 --> 02:07:37,318
It's the only place I went.

656
02:07:37,438 --> 02:07:38,119
It's awesome.

657
02:07:38,259 --> 02:07:40,620
But man, I'll tell you the, it's like, I called.

658
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:43,021
I gave my two weeks.

659
02:07:43,041 --> 02:07:43,901
I got like, furious.

660
02:07:44,041 --> 02:07:45,942
He's like, get this, dig this, man.

661
02:07:45,962 --> 02:07:47,823
He's like, oh, well, this person gave me $9,000.

662
02:07:47,883 --> 02:07:49,604
This person gave me $6,000.

663
02:07:49,664 --> 02:07:53,246
It's like, the guy's crazy.

664
02:07:53,286 --> 02:07:56,407
I had to apply, but he's like, he didn't even say it's like most of it.

665
02:07:59,244 --> 02:08:00,464
Good afternoon, everybody.

666
02:08:02,405 --> 02:08:03,685
All right, all right.

667
02:08:05,966 --> 02:08:10,207
All right, so we successfully navigated through the first act of the day.

668
02:08:11,187 --> 02:08:13,768
Hope everybody that was here to hear it enjoyed it.

669
02:08:14,968 --> 02:08:17,149
And we are now back for round two.

670
02:08:17,969 --> 02:08:23,911
Okay, now lest we get accused of false advertising, I wanna say upfront,

671
02:08:25,149 --> 02:08:27,271
No, Terry Lynn Carrington is not here.

672
02:08:29,032 --> 02:08:31,114
We'll get her here at some point in time.

673
02:08:31,614 --> 02:08:39,480
What is here are members of her Institute for Jazz and Gender Justice.

674
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:42,623
Okay.

675
02:08:43,844 --> 02:08:48,167
So multi-year initiative by Berkeley.

676
02:08:50,592 --> 02:09:05,419
And the design, as I've heard and understand it, is to make sure that the local area, state of Massachusetts, New England, the United States,

677
02:09:06,607 --> 02:09:16,513
And globally, jazz by different performers, different stripes, ethnicities, characters, genders, is being heard.

678
02:09:17,053 --> 02:09:32,003
And opportunities are being given to all groups to play together and enjoy the music, which is really, really meant for everybody, which is one of the tools that we still have to bring people together.

679
02:09:34,504 --> 02:09:37,986
She sent her best, and we're ready to receive them.

680
02:09:40,408 --> 02:09:56,517
The group is led by Anastasia Podrova, okay, who's currently an assistant professor at Berkeley and Long Beach School of Music, has accolades,

681
02:09:59,525 --> 02:10:11,528
I mean, I can't even begin to go all the places that she's been, but, you know, Italy, Bulgaria, just all over the world, Monterey, California, everywhere.

682
02:10:11,668 --> 02:10:19,410
So she has a bachelor's degree in professional music and performance at Berkeley and a master's degree in global jazz as well.

683
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:21,291
Joining her is

684
02:10:23,311 --> 02:10:36,133
and I hope I'm gonna pronounce these things right, Annabelle Gil-Diaz, and she's a flautist, and she also plays clarinet and a couple of wood instruments, highly skilled, also a Berklee product.

685
02:10:37,554 --> 02:10:50,276
And also on the stand-up bass is Chris Lee, another Berklee alum, and on the drums is Aidan Ward-Richter.

686
02:10:51,494 --> 02:10:54,795
Okay, so they are going to do the Don thing.

687
02:10:55,055 --> 02:10:59,157
I am going to get out of the Don way and make room for the music.

688
02:10:59,677 --> 02:11:12,661
Ladies and gentlemen, from the Terry Lynn Carrington's Institute for Jazz and Gender Justice, here's our quartet.

689
02:15:38,302 --> 02:15:38,662
do do

690
02:16:36,602 --> 02:16:37,042
do do

691
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:24,560
you

692
02:17:59,079 --> 02:18:00,119
Well, hello, everyone.

693
02:18:00,159 --> 02:18:03,021
Thank you so much for being here on a sunny, hot day.

694
02:18:04,401 --> 02:18:11,384
This was a composition by Brias Kornberg, the trumpet player, which I didn't know until this book was published either.

695
02:18:11,784 --> 02:18:17,667
So the book, most of the musicians we're playing today is from the book that's called New Standards.

696
02:18:18,247 --> 02:18:28,382
which was published by Taylor and Carrington two years ago, and it's such an incredible book because it features a lot of music that has been unheard for years and years and years.

697
02:18:29,203 --> 02:18:33,489
I had the pleasure of putting this together as a copyist, working with some of the composers.

698
02:18:35,331 --> 02:18:48,343
directly, and Higher Grounds is the next competition that we're going to do is the competition, the chart for which we put together with Ingrid Jensen directly over the email, and then I got a chance to meet with her as well.

699
02:18:48,803 --> 02:18:53,087
So all of these incredible musicians, composers, they're also great people.

700
02:18:53,187 --> 02:19:00,013
So it's a great combo to have, and I'm lucky to have all these incredible musicians on stage with me as well.

701
02:19:00,393 --> 02:19:06,021
which I worked with every one of them separately in different capacities, but never really together as a band.

702
02:19:06,562 --> 02:19:09,145
So this is an interesting adventure for us as well.

703
02:19:09,165 --> 02:19:12,570
All right, next one is Higher Grounds by Ingrid Jansen.

704
02:20:15,333 --> 02:20:15,474
do

705
02:21:34,691 --> 02:21:34,752
you

706
02:27:03,632 --> 02:27:04,313
do do do

707
02:28:34,926 --> 02:28:36,367
do do

708
02:29:42,490 --> 02:29:43,532
do do

709
02:31:15,158 --> 02:31:15,618
do do

710
02:36:18,903 --> 02:36:19,323
do do

711
02:36:52,306 --> 02:36:52,487
Oh.

712
02:37:11,943 --> 02:37:15,967
That was Blues for Orb by Emily Remler, a very talented guitar player.

713
02:37:16,547 --> 02:37:18,209
And now we're going to switch things up a little bit.

714
02:37:18,229 --> 02:37:19,190
We're going to do a ballad.

715
02:37:19,930 --> 02:37:25,215
And this one is very special, because it's actually written by Terlyn Carrington, and it's written four ways shorter.

716
02:37:25,836 --> 02:37:31,321
And both of them are, I believe, to all of us, they are mentors, if not in a...

717
02:37:32,661 --> 02:37:34,602
direct way and definitely indirect way.

718
02:37:35,102 --> 02:37:37,543
I had the pleasure studying with Wayne Shorter during COVID.

719
02:37:37,583 --> 02:37:43,646
That was the only advantage of being locked down that Wayne Shorter could zoom in and spend some time with us just teaching us.

720
02:37:44,146 --> 02:37:45,047
Maybe you were there too.

721
02:37:45,807 --> 02:37:46,047
Maybe.

722
02:37:46,067 --> 02:37:46,127
And

723
02:37:49,048 --> 02:38:04,195
We've all worked with Taylor Lincoln in different ways and I actually met Anna the first time at the Landmark Orchestra at the Head Show because we presented her work at the Head Show in Boston along the Charles River and that's how we met.

724
02:38:05,416 --> 02:38:13,078
Well, we worked with Chris as a host in the jam session, the new standards jam session, where we were playing this music.

725
02:38:13,719 --> 02:38:18,740
And whoever came in, they had to also read the music and join us.

726
02:38:19,440 --> 02:38:25,002
So this is one of the songs that has a special meaning, because it's by Terling Harkin, Four Way and Shorter.

727
02:38:26,143 --> 02:38:27,163
And it's called Samsara.

728
02:38:53,515 --> 02:38:53,836
do do

729
02:39:24,338 --> 02:39:25,679
do do

730
02:41:35,091 --> 02:41:35,892
do do

731
02:42:04,896 --> 02:42:05,157
you

732
02:42:43,080 --> 02:42:43,141
you

733
02:44:37,494 --> 02:44:39,495
That was Samsara by Terlyn Carrington.

734
02:44:41,105 --> 02:44:49,232
And by the way, I also have to mention that, you know, if you're interested in hearing more of this music, it's recorded by Dillian Carrington and other incredible musicians.

735
02:44:49,732 --> 02:44:52,274
Some of them do work in the Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice.

736
02:44:52,314 --> 02:44:53,655
Some of them work at Berklee.

737
02:44:53,675 --> 02:44:55,737
Some of them just don't work at Berklee at all.

738
02:44:55,797 --> 02:44:57,038
And that's cool too, you know.

739
02:44:58,379 --> 02:45:00,300
And it's called New Standards.

740
02:45:00,340 --> 02:45:01,942
So it's the same title as the book.

741
02:45:02,162 --> 02:45:03,843
And I actually brought the physical copy of the book.

742
02:45:03,863 --> 02:45:06,325
Anna also has the physical copy.

743
02:45:10,017 --> 02:45:10,698
It's not for sale.

744
02:45:11,058 --> 02:45:11,999
It's my personal copy.

745
02:45:12,920 --> 02:45:13,981
But this is the book.

746
02:45:14,001 --> 02:45:19,887
It has all the shit music for many different tunes, different genres.

747
02:45:20,347 --> 02:45:22,790
Some of them are really, really hard, to be honest.

748
02:45:23,471 --> 02:45:23,851
Very hard.

749
02:45:26,657 --> 02:45:40,908
And one of the hardest ones, actually, is not even in the book, and I brought it because Sterling Hankin brought this chart from Jerry Allen to the ensemble that I was taking at the time as a student in 2018, the first year of the institute.

750
02:45:41,148 --> 02:45:47,192
And right now, we're basically six years in, and it has grown immensely, which is amazing.

751
02:45:47,532 --> 02:45:49,214
But this is the tune that I played with her in 2018.

752
02:45:51,335 --> 02:45:55,579
I'm not afraid to say that her favorite pianist is Jerry Allen, right?

753
02:45:55,740 --> 02:45:57,061
Would it be right to say that?

754
02:45:58,022 --> 02:45:59,143
I think she has mentioned that.

755
02:45:59,243 --> 02:46:04,388
And when Jerry passed away unexpectedly, it was just such a very tough time.

756
02:46:05,349 --> 02:46:07,131
And this is the song by Jerry Allen.

757
02:46:07,171 --> 02:46:10,154
If you don't know who Jerry Allen is, check it out on YouTube.

758
02:46:10,174 --> 02:46:11,796
There is a live recording of the song.

759
02:46:11,836 --> 02:46:13,077
And this song is a drum feature.

760
02:46:13,117 --> 02:46:15,019
It's called Drummer's Song.

761
02:46:47,864 --> 02:46:49,265
do do

762
02:47:09,833 --> 02:47:10,073
do do

763
02:47:38,450 --> 02:47:38,570
do

764
02:49:53,300 --> 02:49:53,401
do

765
02:54:11,459 --> 02:54:12,165
Music.

766
02:54:36,701 --> 02:54:39,783
That was Drummer's Song by incredible pianist Jerry Allen.

767
02:54:39,803 --> 02:54:44,485
I started talking about the New Standards album, and I actually didn't finish what I was going to say.

768
02:54:44,886 --> 02:54:47,127
But New Standards album, Volume 1.

769
02:54:47,287 --> 02:54:48,027
Why is it Volume 1?

770
02:54:48,087 --> 02:54:51,109
Because she wants to record the whole 101 compositions.

771
02:54:52,150 --> 02:55:01,034
And I have to mention that Anna just received her recognition of participation on that album, because that album got the Grammy, won the Grammy.

772
02:55:01,054 --> 02:55:03,536
So Anna officially is a Grammy winning artist as well.

773
02:55:13,735 --> 02:55:14,776
Who knows John Coltrane?

774
02:55:16,437 --> 02:55:17,738
Who knows Alice Coltrane?

775
02:55:19,219 --> 02:55:27,885
She's the wife of John Coltrane, but she's an incredible, incredible pianist, harpist, organist, and composer.

776
02:55:27,925 --> 02:55:29,826
And this is one of her tunes, Blue Nile.

777
02:55:43,724 --> 02:55:44,125
do do

778
02:58:59,189 --> 02:58:59,249
do

779
02:59:44,369 --> 02:59:44,531
you

780
03:01:27,205 --> 03:01:27,545
do do

781
03:05:04,124 --> 03:05:05,824
That was Blue Now by Alice Coltrane.

782
03:05:06,605 --> 03:05:27,049
I also have to tell you, this does feel surreal, because we're playing all the music by female composers, and that's pretty surreal, because when I was back home in Kazakhstan, I'm from Almaty, Kazakhstan, Taylor Lincoln brought her band called Mosaic, and it was all women, and I was a teenager, I was like, yeah, there are no women in music.

783
03:05:27,249 --> 03:05:29,049
I mean, I know it, so it's fine.

784
03:05:29,269 --> 03:05:31,430
I'm like, I'm trying to be one, but you know, it's fine.

785
03:05:31,450 --> 03:05:32,670
My mom is also a musician, but...

786
03:05:33,690 --> 03:05:34,610
Okay, it's fine.

787
03:05:34,791 --> 03:05:36,111
If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.

788
03:05:36,131 --> 03:05:45,135
So I went to get a non-music degree, because I didn't really see any examples of female musicians out there.

789
03:05:45,715 --> 03:05:52,318
And Terry was one of them, and when she came to my hometown in 2013, I was blown away, and I was blown away by the music too, that was just...

790
03:05:52,958 --> 03:05:58,580
putting me in a certain place, like when I listen to music, and I'm sure you can relate to that, like it just puts you somewhere else.

791
03:05:58,780 --> 03:06:05,522
It's just like, oh, I just start thinking about things you haven't really thought before or didn't have time to think before.

792
03:06:05,622 --> 03:06:07,682
So that was a life-changing event.

793
03:06:07,782 --> 03:06:10,763
I would never imagine that I would be here in the U.S.

794
03:06:11,063 --> 03:06:19,606
years later studying with her in person and now professionally working with her to performing, recording, which is really an honor.

795
03:06:20,306 --> 03:06:22,309
she's really, she's building the community.

796
03:06:22,349 --> 03:06:30,458
She's from Medford and she's indirectly building the Medford community too, and just the women around the world and non-binary musicians as well.

797
03:06:31,078 --> 03:06:34,662
So it's, I just, I was playing the song and I was like, wow, this is insane.

798
03:06:34,963 --> 03:06:36,785
This is pretty, pretty cool.

799
03:06:45,307 --> 03:06:47,849
So the next one we're going to do, we're going to bring it back up a little bit.

800
03:06:48,089 --> 03:06:51,012
And this is Syllogism by Mary Lou Williams.

801
03:06:51,533 --> 03:07:02,903
This song is not in the book, but there is a song by Mary Lou Williams in the book that's called Pisces, which is from her Zodiac suit, which we actually got to celebrate with Landmark Orchestra.

802
03:07:04,364 --> 03:07:05,445
And so this is Syllogism.

803
03:07:23,800 --> 03:07:23,880
do

804
03:09:11,421 --> 03:09:12,143
Yeah.

805
03:13:46,991 --> 03:13:47,131
do

806
03:14:18,214 --> 03:14:40,954
all right again they have a couple more tunes but aren't they great really berkeley's institute for jazz for gender justice uh just before they wrap up with a couple more um just wanted again to thank our sponsors this is not possible without them it really takes an entire community of support in order to make an event like this happen so again medford arts council the arts alive foundation

807
03:14:41,474 --> 03:14:53,681
Medford Berkeley Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, of course, the Arts Collaborative Medford, which is where we hosted our student night last night, the West, and of course, to the West Medford Community Center, which is this amazing historic space.

808
03:14:53,941 --> 03:15:00,885
If you haven't walked around inside to learn about some of the history of this building on your way out, perhaps, I'd highly encourage you to do that.

809
03:15:02,326 --> 03:15:03,947
Thank you also to Audient Sound Company.

810
03:15:05,902 --> 03:15:10,457
to Kevin Harrington over there with West Med, not West Medford, Medford Community Media.

811
03:15:11,994 --> 03:15:16,416
to Triangle Mander, Gnomon Copy and Print, and Members Plus Credit Union.

812
03:15:16,736 --> 03:15:19,058
So again, thank you so much.

813
03:15:20,078 --> 03:15:27,242
Last but not least, this is a free public event, but of course, events are not entirely free without crowdfunding support.

814
03:15:27,342 --> 03:15:40,229
So if you feel inspired by what you hear today, there are QR code links for donations on the back of your programs, or you can always hit up one of the many cash boxes that are strategically placed around this community center.

815
03:15:41,960 --> 03:15:43,840
That said, I'll let them do a couple more.

816
03:15:44,101 --> 03:15:46,301
And thanks again to you all.

817
03:15:46,981 --> 03:15:48,222
Sounds wonderful.

818
03:15:48,382 --> 03:15:49,422
It's such a treat for all of us.

819
03:15:51,462 --> 03:15:54,483
Jonathan, thank you so much for having us here.

820
03:15:54,643 --> 03:16:01,185
And I always mention when I talk about this festival, it's just really like us four just putting together a festival.

821
03:16:01,405 --> 03:16:04,485
There's two people, Shayla and Jonathan.

822
03:16:05,566 --> 03:16:06,506
It's very impressive.

823
03:16:07,066 --> 03:16:10,307
All right, we're going to continue with The Message Continues by Nubia Garcia.

824
03:16:10,327 --> 03:16:20,751
And then we're going to close it off with Lawns by Carla Bley, which another title of that is Two Hearts, for which Teri Lankanathan wrote lyrics.

825
03:16:21,511 --> 03:16:25,713
So that's Message Continues, and then Lawns, and then we'll see how we feel.

826
03:16:26,393 --> 03:16:28,814
And by the way, shout out to these incredible musicians.

We're going to do a quick one.

837
03:25:03,006 --> 03:25:05,567
And this will be by Carla Bley, as I mentioned already.

838
03:25:06,067 --> 03:25:06,727
Carla Bley.

839
03:25:06,767 --> 03:25:07,628
Who knows Paul Bley?

840
03:25:08,908 --> 03:25:09,829
That's her husband.

841
03:25:15,031 --> 03:25:17,272
And we actually, we're going to do our own arrangement.

842
03:25:17,292 --> 03:25:18,533
We're going to do it in samba.

843
03:25:18,593 --> 03:25:24,736
Well, it's actually, it's a very slow tune, but we're going to, it's a slow but groovy tune, but we're going to groove it in the Brazilian way.

Hallelujah.

03:35:00,691 --> 03:35:03,534
And as Anna said, she's on the piano.

03:35:21,407 --> 03:35:21,827
All right.

03:35:25,688 --> 03:35:26,848
Come away from the speaker.

862
03:35:27,828 --> 03:35:28,849
Come away from the speaker.

863
03:35:28,949 --> 03:35:29,249
Okay.

864
03:35:29,709 --> 03:35:30,329
Sorry about that.

865
03:35:31,828 --> 03:35:34,150
We'll be back tomorrow, okay?

866
03:35:35,272 --> 03:35:40,037
And we'll have two other bands for you to enjoy.

867
03:35:40,457 --> 03:35:44,041
Kevin Harris will be here with his quartet.

868
03:35:44,802 --> 03:35:49,106
And the gym repper, Nonet, that's nine pieces, all right?

869
03:35:49,206 --> 03:35:49,987
Right up here.

870
03:35:51,428 --> 03:35:52,690
They'll be here tomorrow too.

03:35:52,710 --> 03:35:53,270
I'm gonna have...

872
03:35:54,255 --> 03:35:59,704
Jonathan Fagan, the founder of the Medford Jazz Festival, come to close us out.

873

Thank you for coming.

03:36:01,487 --> 03:36:02,749
Hope you enjoyed yourselves.

875
03:36:02,989 --> 03:36:04,091
Hope you'll come back tomorrow.

876
03:36:04,111 --> 03:36:04,672
We'll be here.

877
03:36:10,222 --> 03:36:11,863
All right, thanks again to Terry.

878
03:36:12,263 --> 03:36:13,023
You beat me to it.

879
03:36:13,123 --> 03:36:22,006
I was just going to announce the two groups tomorrow, the Jim Reba Nonette and also Kevin Harris Project, featuring a pretty legendary Boston trumpet player, Jason Palmer.

880
03:36:22,526 --> 03:36:23,366
So please come back.

881
03:36:23,526 --> 03:36:26,207
And again, consider donating to the festival if you like what you see.

882
03:36:26,287 --> 03:36:34,470
Thanks again to our sponsors, to all the people working behind the scenes to make this happen, and to Anna, well, I guess the two Annas, actually, and this wonderful group.

883
03:36:34,850 --> 03:36:35,790
So have a great afternoon.
