    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=68.61s">Get</a>  it, honey, I can't provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=70.672s">The</a>  atmosphere is warm. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=71.613s">I</a>  want you to feel inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=73.194s">Don't</a>  want to be saying that you should've. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=75.136s">You</a>  got the flavor, I've got the sugar. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=77.378s">So</a>  would you get with the vibe, like when the jacks and fives hit? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=81.281s">Shake</a>  your body down to the ground, like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=84.744s">Shake</a>  me to the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=85.805s">I'ma</a>  call you up, honey, please make it good.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=102.143s">Yeah!</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=143.177s">Our</a>  daughter, Jessie, loves playing detective. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=145.94s">A</a>  clue.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=146.941s">But</a>  since we discovered she has sensitive</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=918.769s">Jim</a>  was at the laundromat when he heard, his ear said, maraca, senor, but his nose said, hey, freshest scent ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=928.135s">Following</a>  his nose, Jim found a man pointing scent beads into the washer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=933.038s">The</a>  scent, the freshness, Jim blurted. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=936.34s">Sir,</a>  your scent maracas smell amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=939.282s">You</a>  could call them scent maracas, but most noses call them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=960.829s">I</a>  heard it was a good spot.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1094.887s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1125.231s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1151.758s">It's</a>  not on the same list? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1154.42s">Okay,</a>  that's my bad.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1197.598s">Hello,</a>  good afternoon, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1201.138s">So</a>  happy to see you out here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1203.459s">The</a>  sky has really, really lightened up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1208.04s">It's</a>  warm, but it's not hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1211.423s">It's</a>  a good day for jazz, don't you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1214.204s">Fantastic,</a>  fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1216.744s">All</a>  right, so let me just set the scene a little bit for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1220.185s">This</a>  is the West Medford Community Center, for those of you that don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1224.546s">You're</a>  sitting in the historical heart of the African American community of West Medford, one of the oldest African American settlements, not only in Massachusetts, but in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1236.988s">And</a>  I was born and raised in this community a few streets over. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1241.992s">I</a>  lived on Jerome Street first, and then I lived on Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1246.055s">That</a>  park over there, Duggar Park, was where we played as kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1250.318s">And</a>  this building, the second building on the site, is where we did literally everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1256.583s">I</a>  learned how to make spaghetti here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1261.086s">I</a>  learned how to build model cars here, just a whole list of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1266.809s">Now</a>  if you get a chance to go in, if you haven't been in before, go in because there's a lot of history on the walls and it's the history of a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1278.434s">And</a>  as with anything, change is the only constant. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1285.758s">So</a>  the neighborhood has changed pretty significantly from the time when I was <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1290.404s">you</a>  know, tooling around on those basketball courts over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1292.984s">I</a>  don't have the knees to do it anymore, so I'm gonna mind my business and stay over here where I'm in my element again. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1300.526s">But</a>  we have a nice program for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1303.747s">This</a>  is the Ally Project, and it is a conglomeration of four folks now, started out as two, myself and Jonathan, <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1317.757s">over</a>  here, we got together at what we like to refer to as the intersection of jazz and social justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1325.441s">We</a>  were both seeking something. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1326.962s">He</a>  was looking for kind of musical collaboration that spoke to the issues of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1336.209s">And</a>  I was looking for an opportunity to take poetry and blend it with jazz and see what it would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1345.556s">So</a>  we met in a very, very congenial space and some good stuff has developed from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1352.101s">Our</a>  drummer, John Dalton, <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1358.157s">came</a>  into the space as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1361.659s">He</a>  has his own music. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1363.44s">He</a>  does this really, really dynamic, progressive thing with a group called Spheres of Influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1369.084s">So</a>  before it's over, we'll have them here at the center playing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1373.266s">And</a>  then Greg Turo here on the big sexy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1376.708s">That's</a>  what I call his bass. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1381.092s">You</a>  know, Grey came into it at a very early stage as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1384.633s">And</a>  we've been a quartet now for a couple years, John? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1388.214s">A</a>  couple years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1389.914s">We</a>  have a CD that we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1392.875s">We</a>  have them up on the porch there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1395.756s">It's</a>  called the Ally Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1397.897s">It's</a>  $15. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1398.497s">If</a>  you got some money floating around, you want to hear some good music, go on and grab yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1402.598s">I've</a>  got some books up there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1406.259s">In</a>  case you were wondering what I am, I'm a poet. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1411.762s">That's</a>  what I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1413.103s">And</a>  I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1415.947s">He's</a>  going to talk about our sponsors and give a few thank yous. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1421.714s">And</a>  then we're going to go on ahead and get started with the music.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1426.877s">No,</a>  thank you very much, Terry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1428.978s">It's</a>  been a pleasure to work with this group for the past couple of years, especially in collaboration with this festival, which also started in 2020, which was not a great year for live music. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1440.602s">I'll</a>  just put it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1442.483s">But</a>  it's gone from a virtual festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1444.304s">It's</a>  been five years now, actually, that we've been plugging away at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1448.685s">And</a>  the support, the community support has grown substantially in that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1453.359s">Before</a>  we get started, I just wanted to thank a couple of people that have made this possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1456.941s">First</a>  of all, a couple of individual sponsors this year, Susan Klein, Steve Shulman, and Ken Krause, as well as our Patreon members, who are people just, you know, people that love jazz and music and community events that have put in a couple dollars every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1473.712s">It's</a>  a subscription service, kind of like, you know, we all have too many subscriptions anyways, so why not add one more, you figure? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1481.374s">But</a>  it really adds up over time, and it allows us to sustain our jam session series and other events that happen over here at the community center, and now at Arts Collaborative Medford, where we were last night, which is a wonderful new space that will soon have lots of performing arts events there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1497.378s">So,</a>  that said, a couple of other people that have made this possible this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1502.099s">Thank</a>  you to Shayla, my partner Shayla. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1504.081s">I</a>  happen to be a little bit biased about how great a job she's done this year, but she is the one responsible for these beautiful programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1511.75s">So</a>  please feel free to take them and look through them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1514.954s">And</a>  if you want any more information about particular artists, it is all in there along with links to websites and personal pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1524.224s">Also</a>  to, well, he isn't here today, but our friend Joe DeMore, who's done a lot of editing and has just built us our brand new website this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1533.669s">So</a>  even if you don't remember your program or it blows away in the wind, I don't know, you can access all of that on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1542.394s">And</a>  soon we'll have a lot of video content for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1548.447s">MedfordJazzFestival.com,</a>  she's telling me to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1552.03s">Speaking</a>  of media, Medford Community Media is here this entire weekend, thanks to Kevin Harrington. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1562.038s">And</a>  also, thanks so much to our sound department, which happens to be Avi Fagan over there, and his assistant, Gilel, as well, who's been helping out for the whole weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1574.892s">Thanks</a>  also to our student volunteer, Eva Balo. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1578.795s">She's</a>  one of my piano students from Brandeis University. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1582.259s">Helped</a>  us set up a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1583.64s">So</a>  it truly is an entire team of people, especially this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1587.203s">It</a>  grows a little bit each time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1589.727s">Last,</a>  a couple of organizational sponsors to, first of all, where we've gotten some of our grants, Medford Arts Council, the Arts Alive Medford Foundation, Berkeley's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, who's responsible for the next group that you're going to hear after this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1604.47s">Anastasia</a>  is an amazing piano player. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1606.471s">I've</a>  known her for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1608.731s">And</a>  she's just doing some great things. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1610.272s">So</a>  you're going to want to stick around for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1612.642s">to</a>  the spaces that we're using this year, Arts Collaborative Medford, that art center from last night, for those of you who were there, and for this West Medford Community Center, which is just the perfect place to have this entire weekend in music. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1626.717s">Morningside</a>  Music Studio, also, to Members Plus Credit Union, Triangle Manor, who printed our beautiful t-shirts, another business right here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1637.179s">So</a>  grab a shirt if you haven't already. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1640.119s">And</a>  to Nomen Copy and Print, too, which helped us out with these crisp-looking programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1645.56s">So</a>  with that said, I'll turn it back over to Terry, who's our poet and is going to kind of be the master of ceremonies here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1656.405s">All</a>  right, let's get to it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1661.61s">So</a>  I talked a little bit about the beginnings of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1666.755s">And</a>  when we first started out, there were three streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1672.841s">And</a>  this is after the Civil War, 1890s or so, when black folks first came to this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1680.589s">there</a>  were three streets that they could live on based on redlining and, you know, unspoken, unwritten covenants that were made by the city fathers that, you know, if there were going to be people of color here, this is where they were going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1694.618s">So</a>  Jerome Street, Arlington Street, and Lincoln Street were the first three streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1700.362s">And</a>  we were right by the Mystic River, and the Mystic River was no great shakes at that <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1706.065s">point</a>  in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1707.526s">It's</a>  much friendlier these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1710.367s">So</a>  we're going to start at the beginning with a piece called Hired by the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1719.711s">They</a>  gave my people the lowlands and not much of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1723.793s">Just</a>  a few streets hired by the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1727.155s">Banks</a>  turned a blind eye behind the red lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1730.58s">And</a>  it wasn't about the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1732.961s">Class</a>  was an irresistible force. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1735.842s">Race</a>  was an immovable object. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1739.424s">Perhaps</a>  it wasn't a written rule, but white folks knew the legal tool to keep us in our space, in this mystic valley place, where slaves and rum and ships had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1760.259s">So</a>  it was hard by the mystic we went. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1763.041s">Muddy</a>  and a bit turned down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1765.503s">The</a>  only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1771.266s">But</a>  we named it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1772.968s">We</a>  claimed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1774.469s">We</a>  made it our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1778.231s">Even</a>  in the heat of summer when the shores were parched and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1787.745s">We</a>  followed his flow to the lakes and the sandy beach front. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1791.807s">On</a>  our own Jordan shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1797.509s">We</a>  caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teeming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed hard by the mystery. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1809.997s">We</a>  became community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1812.318s">We</a>  commanded unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1814.34s">We</a>  embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1823.886s">As</a>  the river ebbs and flows, the tides will turn and our fortune grows. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1829.429s">A</a>  few more streets become our home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1831.911s">Houses</a>  on Sharon join kin on Jerome. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1835.902s">From</a>  Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the white folks make more room for blacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1841.926s">The</a>  color line recedes a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1844.427s">Church</a>  and school and center fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1848.99s">The</a>  bill becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shores. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1854.553s">Now</a>  the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1866.852s">Muddy</a>  Mystic most days is clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1869.416s">The</a>  banks are freshly cut and green. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1872.14s">Faces</a>  once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1880.546s">These</a>  streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines, condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, invest, and dispossess. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1915.939s">Now</a>  those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1920.784s">And</a>  sometimes success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1935.138s">And</a>  yet, the river still turns and bends. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1939.485s">from</a>  where it begins to where it ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1943.288s">The</a>  only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town, where we named it and claimed it and made it our own.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1957.039s">All</a>  right, all right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1963.124s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1965.166s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1967.739s">All</a>  right, so that kind of establishes a little bit of a theme, and so we're gonna follow it just a little bit further with a piece we call Gentrified.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=1977.483s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2023.755s">See</a>  John Dalton back there, he's the soul of ingenuity with the paper, with the clothespins. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2028.839s">Yeah,</a>  man. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2031.301s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2031.741s">All</a>  right, we good? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2034.423s">All</a>  right, let's do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2060.687s">They</a>  talk about renovating, reimagining, and rehabilitating. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2065.703s">They</a>  rave about new visions, new horizons, and new perspectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2071.048s">They</a>  revel in bistros, boutiques, and boulangeries. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2075.492s">They</a>  barely skip to the subway stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2078.095s">They</a>  bike on the painted pathways. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2080.457s">They</a>  Uber and Lyft religiously. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2083.62s">Everything's</a>  on trend and on point and au pair. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2089.042s">They've</a>  codified the way we, they speak about what used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2093.805s">Urban</a>  blight, eyesores, drug dens, crack houses, tenements and slums, the ghetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2102.31s">They</a>  modify the way they speak about what we now see. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2105.773s">Makeovers,</a>  investment properties, B&Bs, brownstones, townhouses, condos, and co-ops. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2114.06s">Everything's</a>  vintage, bohemian, artsy, and retro, with creative green spaces and lofted open places. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2130.661s">Speculators</a>  bought lower than low, patiently waiting for the change, waiting for the junkies to move on, waiting for the squatters to give up, waiting for the black and the brown and the tan to fade. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2149.895s">They</a>  waited for the graffiti to erode. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2152.776s">They</a>  waited for the chain link to corrode. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2155.378s">They</a>  waited for the families to implode. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2157.899s">They</a>  waited for the prices to explode. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2161.4s">They</a>  waited and they calculated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2164.482s">They</a>  waited as folks capitulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2167.203s">They</a>  waited as folks evacuated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2170.525s">They</a>  waited as folks migrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2178.004s">Then</a>  the realtors came and dispelled white folks' fears. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2181.53s">The</a>  architects came and re-engineered. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2184.455s">The</a>  designers came and changed the veneers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2187.26s">The</a>  builders came and the new folk cheered. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2197.091s">Now</a>  they've moved closer to work in the city, to quartz countertops that made kitchens pretty, to charter schools, nannies, and drivers, and bike frames made with carbon fibers, to Starbucks lattes and artisanal breads, and articulated sleep number beds, to million dollar urban show places, and fewer and fewer black and brown faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2232.349s">They</a>  showed us their heels when they took the white flight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2235.531s">Then</a>  they crept back in in the dead of night. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2238.113s">With</a>  fat bank accounts, they were IPO wealthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2242.117s">Their</a>  move to displace was measured and stealthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2247.2s">All</a>  of the potholes now smoothly paved over. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2251.124s">Brown</a>  folks got schooled like a curry crossover. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2254.466s">White</a>  folks doing a long-term sleepover. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2257.267s">Exclusive,</a>  obtrusive, extreme home makeover. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2261.428s">With</a>  a spoonful of sugar, they took all the clover. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2266.649s">Changing</a>  the context of neighborhood with subway tile and exotic wood. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2271.19s">Harlem,</a>  Detroit, and Chicago's South Side. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2274.83s">Boston's</a>  South End surely gentrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2280.071s">Emptied</a>  the church, emptied the steeple, now it's a spot for the chai-drinking people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2285.458s">Took</a>  down the poles in the basketball hoops, now it's the park for the dog-walking troops. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2291.086s">No</a>  more wrecking community center, but a new parking lot for the monthly rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2302.697s">Some</a>  folks hang on, but the die is cast. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2305.459s">The</a>  fire consumes and the torch is passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2308.421s">Invisible</a>  lines are drawn again, and folks can't buy when the banks won't lend. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2316.621s">Some</a>  folks keep their roots in the ground, but the waiting game is deep and profound. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2321.725s">They</a>  tour the streets noting history, yet what they want is no mystery. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2326.79s">Harlem,</a>  Detroit, and Chicago South Tide, a reoccupation is being applied to model cities that trickle down no longer suited to black and brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2344.4s">The</a>  urban sprawl that used to be the only homes we got to see is now the place for a growing infusion, is now the place that the gentry is choosing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2360.598s">low</a>  rise projects slowly yield to equity building leases sealed to folks who came from far afield who won the fight when the poor folk appealed to lawyers and doctors and high tech heroes with trust fund ones and hedge fund zeros. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2381.195s">No</a>  preserving community, no real thought of legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2384.536s">A</a>  small plaque here, a street sign there, nothing that bronzes the atmosphere. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2390.577s">Oakland,</a>  Brooklyn, and New Orleans, all made targets by whites with means. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2399.099s">Even</a>  in venerable Chocolate City, the news in the district inspires much pity. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2467.301s">killing</a>  the concept of neighborhood in ways they've never understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2472.704s">And</a>  now we witness the slow, painful slide as the village we built becomes gentrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2490.073s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2492.054s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2493.948s">All</a>  right, so that's some of the intersection of jazz and social justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2502.611s">Let's</a>  rest on jazz for a little minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2505.892s">We're</a>  going to do a piece called Reprise for Afro Blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2510.714s">And</a>  Afro Blue song has been done by a lot of different folks, Herbie Hancock, more recently Robert <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2524.298s">Yeah,</a>  Robert Glasper does a real nice version of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2529.52s">Erykah</a>  Badu actually sings on that version. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2533.361s">It's</a>  really, really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2535.781s">But</a>  we like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2537.722s">And</a>  so wrote a few little lyrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2541.123s">And</a>  we're just going to let the band do what the band does. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2545.304s">So</a>  this is Reprise for Afro Blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2601.067s">Dark</a>  is the mystery of the soul. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2603.648s">Drums</a>  are its heartbeat pole to pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2607.71s">Coated</a>  with roasted umber hue, coffee and caramel afro blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2627.588s">Pretty</a>  black boy, lovely brown girl. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2631.014s">Glowing</a>  and glistening mother of pearl. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2634.199s">Surely</a>  the love is deep and true. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2637.444s">Cobalt</a>  and indigo, afro blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2654.209s">The</a>  dawn of the first pink light reveals a smoldering kiss that the darkness conceals. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2661.461s">Coated</a>  with roasted umber hue, coffee and caramel afro blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2697.213s">Soul</a>  beckons soul as the lovers embrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2700.775s">Fire</a>  melts ice beyond time and space. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2705.138s">Surely</a>  the love is strong and true. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2708.76s">Cobalt</a>  and indigo, afro blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2780.919s">There</a>  is no misery in their song. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2783.9s">Heartbeats</a>  and rhythms solid and strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2787.201s">Coated</a>  with roasted umber, you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2790.422s">Coffee</a>  and caramel, afro blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2794.424s">Coated</a>  with roasted umber, you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2797.705s">Coffee</a>  and caramel, afro blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2809.522s">John</a>  Dalton on drums, Greg Toro on bass, Jonathan Fagan on the keys.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2816.809s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2817.51s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2820.193s">Yeah,</a>  let's do that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2825.996s">So</a>  there are a few names in the jazz canon that are synonymous with excellence. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2832.96s">And</a>  like, if you're really into jazz, like these are folks that you just know, you just know them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2838.683s">Miles</a>  Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2845.655s">So</a>  we're gonna do a piece, Jonathan and I, that's kind of a takeoff on the music of Thelonious Monk. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2853.842s">And</a>  if you know about Monk, genius, that's first thing, but led a very, very tragic life and relatively short-lived. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2868.174s">So</a>  see if we can tell a little bit of a story. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2900.427s">You</a>  were the mystic and the mage with every scribble on each lined page. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2906.014s">So</a>  deadly serious at that bench with eyes ablaze and teeth in clinch. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2912.743s">Tones</a>  that spin discordant perfection, harmonic twists in every reflection. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2919.284s">What</a>  is the meaning of all this scatter as you summon rhythmic antimatter? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2924.945s">Why</a>  must you rage and violently pound each key to achieve such a potent sound? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2931.267s">Reveling</a>  in a cerulean funk, you were the least obedient monk. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2938.769s">Sometimes</a>  you wax melodic and quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2941.889s">Then</a>  you revert to the din of a riot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2945.595s">Every</a>  chord with a stranglehold on conventional music centerfold. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2952.758s">A</a>  bit of the Duke's panache in style with James P. Johnson's strident guile. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2957.82s">Yours</a>  were the most ambitious spirit in every bar the night can hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2966.866s">The</a>  grand piano majestically sits. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2969.808s">It</a>  has no sense of the crimes it commits. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2972.389s">It</a>  tolerates explosive bits of cosmic slop as the maestro sits. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2980.216s">in</a>  a soft felt fez or a pork pie hat, you are a different kind of cat. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=2985.641s">Fingers</a>  like Harlem stickball bats, scurrying quick like tenement rats, over those keys while the saxophone scats, over those keys while the drummer pats, over those keys with sharps and flats, while the bass man thumbs out welcome mats in front of the door of Handy and Fats. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3002.836s">Real</a>  conversation, not idle chats. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3008.939s">Wed</a>  to the notes like a pretty young wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3011.443s">You</a>  brought jazz piano back to life and made the music cut like a knife. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3016.129s">Skipping</a>  chords and dissonant strife. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3018.913s">Never</a>  to march like a drum and fife. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3021.697s">With</a>  crackling sparks, your soul was rife. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3029.761s">Yet</a>  waves of sickness embrace your spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3033.886s">The</a>  music allowed you to hardly hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3037.089s">Oceans</a>  of darkness and you didn't fear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3039.893s">A</a>  constant hurdle, we watched you clear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3044.801s">Or</a>  rather we listened in special awe As camels buckled with every star You piled on top of harmonic law As bop and stride made doubters thaw You'd ever succumb to a tragic flaw And be undone by depression's claw <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3064.969s">So</a>  still the vinyl adorns the platter as we revel in musical anti-matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3071.512s">Madame</a>  Panonica's lilting splatter round midnight with a truly, truly mad hatter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3078.876s">Solitude</a>  embraces a tortured soul that scales the peaks of an opposite pole through a Thorazine haze that takes control and still the maestro maintains control. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3092.196s">The</a>  Steinway bursts in dynamic tone, and yet the madness won't leave him alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3098.861s">The</a>  abbot cowers and refuses to pray as the musical friar prepares to slay. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3108.248s">The</a>  Steinway engages in mythical work while legions of demons quietly lurk. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3115.99s">ready</a>  to take the altar away to assault the monk as we hear him play. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3129.937s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3131.218s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3133.239s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3134.119s">So</a>  there are a few folks here, not many, a few folks here who are going to know exactly what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3142.383s">But</a>  the beauty of this thing is that for the rest of you, even if you don't know about my situation, you're going to be able to wed it to your situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3152.765s">That's</a>  the beauty of community-based poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3156.506s">So</a>  this is called The Little Store.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3171.249s">It</a>  was a tiny red hovel on Upper Jerome. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3175.15s">A</a>  bit run down and rough around the edges. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3178.491s">And</a>  Mr. Henry seemed so old to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3182.452s">Even</a>  then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient, and a little scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3188.914s">One</a>  would suspect that he didn't even like kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3192.695s">But</a>  he really must have loved us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3195.276s">Or</a>  else, where did all that penny candy come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3200.717s">He</a>  had all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3202.298s">No,</a>  seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3204.298s">We'd</a>  bust in there with a few nickels or a handful of copper, all loud and unruly. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3211.581s">He'd</a>  hush us up while he finished with grown folks' business. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3215.943s">Then</a>  he'd be back, like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3219.784s">He'd</a>  peer over those old horn-rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3225.566s">Then</a>  he'd blow open one of those small brown craft paper bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3230.737s">and</a>  get to stuffin' while we were oohin' and ahin' and huffin' and puffin'. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3237.624s">See,</a>  Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3247.165s">root</a>  beer barrels and pixie sticks, squirrel nut zippers and banana splits, green mint juleps and button strips, red licorice ropes and bottle nips. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3256.996s">He</a>  had bazooka Joe bubble gum and a tiny sucker called a dum-dum, jawbreakers and tootsie rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3265.946s">Sugary</a>  love for little kid souls. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3268.869s">Candy</a>  necklaces to wear and bite and waxy red lips with such a sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3273.894s">Fat</a>  gum cigars and kid cigarettes right beside the crunchy six-lets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3278.979s">Mary</a>  Jane chewies and BB bats, hot fireballs and Mexican hats. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3283.484s">Just</a>  the genuine Hershey's kisses. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3286.667s">All</a>  of the hits and none of the misses. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3289.85s">Like</a>  Kit, taffy squares, and Necco wafers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3292.832s">Liquor</a>  made in Boston baked beans. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3295.313s">Gold</a>  rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3298.755s">A</a>  kid's idea, sweet tooth swag. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3303.037s">Before</a>  the days of Laffy Taffys, we would gobble up peppermint patties. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3307.419s">Before</a>  we knew about gummy bears, Twizzlers always came in pairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3313.26s">Chewy</a>  cow tails had a creamy filling, but sugar babies had top filling. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3318.044s">Reese's</a>  peanut butter cups had us squealing like newborn pups. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3323.049s">Mikey</a>  Nikes and orange slices, saltwater taffy and tiny prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3328.214s">Lifesavers</a>  and charms and fruity flavors, we grabbed those bags like potty favors. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3334.764s">Chuckles</a>  were a favorite choice, and Milk Duds made us all rejoice. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3339.427s">Jolly</a>  Ranchers and Bitter Honey, we always got a lot for our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3350.253s">Talk</a>  about kids getting excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3352.414s">You</a>  can't imagine the flame he ignited. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3354.876s">Our</a>  greedy fingers could barely wait to take that candy like fish take bait. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3363.063s">From</a>  cold January to chilly December, more kinds of candy than I can remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3369.226s">At</a>  the Ville storefront on Upper Jerome, I knew I had to write this poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3375.749s">See,</a>  Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3390.279s">So</a>  you see, you know, everybody in their own way, own neighborhood, bodega, whatever, can relate. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3399.386s">Because</a>  every community had a Mr. Henry in a little store. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3402.868s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3404.409s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3405.25s">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3414.657s">Where</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3415.478s">Oh,</a>  here it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3418.797s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3421.438s">Again,</a>  what we began doing when we got together, Jonathan and I, is figuring out how we could tell some stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3430.641s">And</a>  so that's what the endeavor has been all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3435.603s">At</a>  the soul of it is telling stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3438.204s">So</a>  this piece is called Legacy, and it'll come to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3486.556s">It's</a>  not for you to tell your own story. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3490.04s">That</a>  is the burden of your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3492.802s">They</a>  must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3496.966s">And</a>  yet, you have not gathered them up and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3504.214s">You</a>  have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their name. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3510.799s">How</a>  will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3514.682s">How</a>  will they learn to tell your stories even as they live out their own? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3528.853s">Sons</a>  and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the ash burning or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3540.836s">If</a>  you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's earthy reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3550.279s">If</a>  mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark, and stoke the flames, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3561.022s">And</a>  until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride stories, the hunters will always tell them first. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3575.643s">The</a>  good book says train up the child in the way they should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3579.567s">Will</a>  we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on a hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3592.342s">Will</a>  we not show them Anansi's clever ways? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3596.67s">Popo</a>  and Fafida's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda and Songololo's new tackies. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3613.046s">The</a>  prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3617.708s">But</a>  how will they know the way home if no map charts the scenes, measures the roads, cites the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3634.442s">Will</a>  the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3638.625s">Will</a>  they care to carry? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3640.967s">Will</a>  they dare to tarry? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3644.076s">Will</a>  they linger at the foot of the griot? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3645.878s">Will</a>  they hunger for the wisdom of the sage? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3650.603s">We</a>  must put them on the page, where hard work earns a man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, where miracles scoff at the wand of a mage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3665.285s">We</a>  must share with them this truth that is loyal and fierce like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional booth, that has the bite of the panther's tooth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3687.465s">This</a>  is a gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captives free, and a candle's light beckons liberty. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3696.428s">Sons</a>  and daughters and heirs, I bid you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3710.939s">They</a>  will show you Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fathina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Songololo's new tackies. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3734.108s">Soon</a>  you will be the herald. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3736.876s">Write</a>  these things down on the tablets of your spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3739.783s">Let</a>  them put a running in your feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3750.683s">With</a>  each quickening step you repel the arrows of the hunter with the shield of abiding faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3755.946s">You</a>  capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3759.908s">You</a>  remain the lions of the pride and your tails will always be your children's bread. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3776.929s">You</a>  will never abandon the community of faith, though you build a thousand cities on a hill, drawing wondrous strength from the master's touch, as the oil of his anointing fills your clay jars with his grace. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3795.374s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3802.896s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3807.984s">I</a>  am, in my estimation, probably the luckiest poet I know because I get to play with these guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3818.509s">And</a>  I didn't, when I started writing poetry and I've been doing it, publishing poetry for <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3826.135s">let's</a>  see, first book in 2010, so almost 15 years now, and I've been writing poetry, you know, really for as long as I can remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3835.317s">But,</a>  you know, had I not met Jonathan, I don't know if I would have gotten to this place, this intersection of jazz and social justice and poetry, and I'm really, I'm very thankful and somewhat humbled by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3852.745s">Thanks,</a>  John D. Thank you, Greg T. Thank you, Jonathan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3857.35s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3860.132s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3861.674s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3862.515s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3863.155s">So</a>  we really, really want this thing to work for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3868.461s">That's</a>  part of why we came together, because we wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3873.993s">espouse</a>  the finer virtues of what we believe that this country honestly can be if it finds the fundamental soul of its people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3883.546s">And</a>  its people are from everywhere, every part of the globe. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3890.254s">every,</a>  you know, haunt and haven, and we bring them here and we harbor them, and if we do it the right way, then what we end up with is a wonderful melting pot and a blissful soup of diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3905.806s">So,</a>  this is for the search for that beloved country, and that's what it's called, Beloved Country.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3923.422s">you</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3957.228s">I</a>  can love this country, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3958.569s">I</a>  didn't have to be born on these barney shores. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3961.993s">I</a>  didn't have to be a son of the Pentacook, Quinnipiac, or Mohican. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3966.978s">I</a>  didn't have to have a pilgrim pedigree or be a Connecticut Yankee from King Arthur's Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3972.303s">I</a>  can be the Dahomian, the Pole, or the child of Caribbean suns and Amazon shades. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3979.75s">I</a>  can love this country, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3981.012s">My</a>  green card was a welcome ticket to a new life in a new land. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3985.879s">My</a>  passport was stamped with new hopes and new dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3989.204s">My</a>  suitcases were packed full with new aspirations and some apprehensions, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=3997.697s">Perhaps</a>  I didn't see the harbor sign that said, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuge of your teeming shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4006.725s">Send</a>  these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4009.648s">I</a>  lift my lamp beside the golden door. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4013.211s">Perhaps</a>  I didn't see the lady in the lamp, but I did see the gleaming city on a hill that couldn't be hid, and my soul responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4024.651s">I</a>  can love this country, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4025.972s">I</a>  can love its rolling meadows and its gospel songs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4030.573s">I</a>  can love its asphalt highways and its born-to-run boss. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4034.975s">I</a>  can love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4037.836s">I</a>  can love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorahs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4049.92s">But</a>  can America love me, too? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4054.281s">Can</a>  she love my hijab and henna tattoos? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4058.063s">Can</a>  she love my Hajj, my Mecca, and my Medina? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4061.565s">Can</a>  she love my Cinco de Mayo and my Dia de los Muertos? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4065.967s">Can</a>  she love my kente cloth, dreads, twists, and locks? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4070.069s">Can</a>  she love the skin I'm in, be it ebony, ivory, dulce de leche, or cafe au lait? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4082.788s">Can</a>  she love me by name? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4085.231s">Shekinah</a>  Glory, Muhammad Bin Saeed, Anastasia Kozov, Cleophis Dorcio, Claudia Gonzalez. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4094.083s">Can</a>  she love me by name? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4102.58s">And</a>  what if I am among those huddled masses in that wretched refuge or that homeless, tempest-tossed? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=4109.744s">Will</a>  she still continue to lift her lamp?

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7679.244s">Good</a>  afternoon, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7682.405s">All</a>  right, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7685.966s">All</a>  right, so we successfully navigated through the first act of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7691.187s">Hope</a>  everybody that was here to hear it enjoyed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7694.968s">And</a>  we are now back for round two. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7697.969s">Okay,</a>  now lest we get accused of false advertising, I wanna say upfront, <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7705.149s">No,</a>  Terry Lynn Carrington is not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7709.032s">We'll</a>  get her here at some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7711.614s">What</a>  is here are members of her Institute for Jazz and Gender Justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7719.5s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7723.844s">So</a>  multi-year initiative by Berkeley. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7730.592s">And</a>  the design, as I've heard and understand it, is to make sure that the local area, state of Massachusetts, New England, the United States, <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7746.607s">And</a>  globally, jazz by different performers, different stripes, ethnicities, characters, genders, is being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7757.053s">And</a>  opportunities are being given to all groups to play together and enjoy the music, which is really, really meant for everybody, which is one of the tools that we still have to bring people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7774.504s">She</a>  sent her best, and we're ready to receive them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7780.408s">The</a>  group is led by Anastasia Podrova, okay, who's currently an assistant professor at Berkeley and Long Beach School of Music, has accolades, <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7799.525s">I</a>  mean, I can't even begin to go all the places that she's been, but, you know, Italy, Bulgaria, just all over the world, Monterey, California, everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7811.668s">So</a>  she has a bachelor's degree in professional music and performance at Berkeley and a master's degree in global jazz as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7820.29s">Joining</a>  her is <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7823.311s">and</a>  I hope I'm gonna pronounce these things right, Annabelle Gil-Diaz, and she's a flautist, and she also plays clarinet and a couple of wood instruments, highly skilled, also a Berklee product. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7837.554s">And</a>  also on the stand-up bass is Chris Lee, another Berklee alum, and on the drums is Aidan Ward-Richter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7851.494s">Okay,</a>  so they are going to do the Don thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7855.055s">I</a>  am going to get out of the Don way and make room for the music. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=7859.677s">Ladies</a>  and gentlemen, from the Terry Lynn Carrington's Institute for Jazz and Gender Justice, here's our quartet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8279.079s">Well,</a>  hello, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8280.159s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here on a sunny, hot day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8284.401s">This</a>  was a composition by Brias Kornberg, the trumpet player, which I didn't know until this book was published either. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8291.784s">So</a>  the book, most of the musicians we're playing today is from the book that's called New Standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8298.247s">which</a>  was published by Taylor and Carrington two years ago, and it's such an incredible book because it features a lot of music that has been unheard for years and years and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8309.203s">I</a>  had the pleasure of putting this together as a copyist, working with some of the composers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8315.331s">directly,</a>  and Higher Grounds is the next competition that we're going to do is the competition, the chart for which we put together with Ingrid Jensen directly over the email, and then I got a chance to meet with her as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8328.803s">So</a>  all of these incredible musicians, composers, they're also great people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8333.187s">So</a>  it's a great combo to have, and I'm lucky to have all these incredible musicians on stage with me as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8340.393s">which</a>  I worked with every one of them separately in different capacities, but never really together as a band. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8346.562s">So</a>  this is an interesting adventure for us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=8349.165s">All</a>  right, next one is Higher Grounds by Ingrid Jansen.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9378.903s">do</a>  do</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9431.943s">That</a>  was Blues for Orb by Emily Remler, a very talented guitar player. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9436.547s">And</a>  now we're going to switch things up a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9438.229s">We're</a>  going to do a ballad. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9439.93s">And</a>  this one is very special, because it's actually written by Terlyn Carrington, and it's written four ways shorter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9445.836s">And</a>  both of them are, I believe, to all of us, they are mentors, if not in a... <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9452.661s">direct</a>  way and definitely indirect way. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9455.102s">I</a>  had the pleasure studying with Wayne Shorter during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9457.583s">That</a>  was the only advantage of being locked down that Wayne Shorter could zoom in and spend some time with us just teaching us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9464.146s">Maybe</a>  you were there too. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9465.807s">Maybe.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9466.067s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9469.048s">We've</a>  all worked with Taylor Lincoln in different ways and I actually met Anna the first time at the Landmark Orchestra at the Head Show because we presented her work at the Head Show in Boston along the Charles River and that's how we met. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9485.416s">Well,</a>  we worked with Chris as a host in the jam session, the new standards jam session, where we were playing this music. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9493.719s">And</a>  whoever came in, they had to also read the music and join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9499.44s">So</a>  this is one of the songs that has a special meaning, because it's by Terling Harkin, Four Way and Shorter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9506.143s">And</a>  it's called Samsara. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9877.494s">That</a>  was Samsara by Terlyn Carrington. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9881.105s">And</a>  by the way, I also have to mention that, you know, if you're interested in hearing more of this music, it's recorded by Dillian Carrington and other incredible musicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9889.732s">Some</a>  of them do work in the Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9892.314s">Some</a>  of them work at Berklee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9893.675s">Some</a>  of them just don't work at Berklee at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9895.797s">And</a>  that's cool too, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9898.379s">And</a>  it's called New Standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9900.34s">So</a>  it's the same title as the book. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9902.162s">And</a>  I actually brought the physical copy of the book. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9903.863s">Anna</a>  also has the physical copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9910.017s">It's</a>  not for sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9911.058s">It's</a>  my personal copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9912.92s">But</a>  this is the book. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9914.001s">It</a>  has all the shit music for many different tunes, different genres. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9920.347s">Some</a>  of them are really, really hard, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9923.471s">Very</a>  hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9926.657s">And</a>  one of the hardest ones, actually, is not even in the book, and I brought it because Sterling Hankin brought this chart from Jerry Allen to the ensemble that I was taking at the time as a student in 2018, the first year of the institute. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9941.148s">And</a>  right now, we're basically six years in, and it has grown immensely, which is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9947.532s">But</a>  this is the tune that I played with her in 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9951.335s">I'm</a>  not afraid to say that her favorite pianist is Jerry Allen, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9955.74s">Would</a>  it be right to say that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9958.022s">I</a>  think she has mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9959.243s">And</a>  when Jerry passed away unexpectedly, it was just such a very tough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9965.349s">And</a>  this is the song by Jerry Allen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9967.171s">If</a>  you don't know who Jerry Allen is, check it out on YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9970.174s">There</a>  is a live recording of the song. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9971.836s">And</a>  this song is a drum feature. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=9973.117s">It's</a>  called Drummer's Song.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10476.701s">That</a>  was Drummer's Song by incredible pianist Jerry Allen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10479.803s">I</a>  started talking about the New Standards album, and I actually didn't finish what I was going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10484.886s">But</a>  New Standards album, Volume 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10487.287s">Why</a>  is it Volume 1? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10488.087s">Because</a>  she wants to record the whole 101 compositions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10492.15s">And</a>  I have to mention that Anna just received her recognition of participation on that album, because that album got the Grammy, won the Grammy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10501.054s">So</a>  Anna officially is a Grammy winning artist as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10513.735s">Who</a>  knows John Coltrane? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10516.437s">Who</a>  knows Alice Coltrane? <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10519.219s">She's</a>  the wife of John Coltrane, but she's an incredible, incredible pianist, harpist, organist, and composer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=10527.925s">And</a>  this is one of her tunes, Blue Nile. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11104.124s">That</a>  was Blue Now by Alice Coltrane. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11106.605s">I</a>  also have to tell you, this does feel surreal, because we're playing all the music by female composers, and that's pretty surreal, because when I was back home in Kazakhstan, I'm from Almaty, Kazakhstan, Taylor Lincoln brought her band called Mosaic, and it was all women, and I was a teenager, I was like, yeah, there are no women in music. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11127.249s">I</a>  mean, I know it, so it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11129.269s">I'm</a>  like, I'm trying to be one, but you know, it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11131.45s">My</a>  mom is also a musician, but... <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11133.69s">Okay,</a>  it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11134.791s">If</a>  it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11136.131s">So</a>  I went to get a non-music degree, because I didn't really see any examples of female musicians out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11145.715s">And</a>  Terry was one of them, and when she came to my hometown in 2013, I was blown away, and I was blown away by the music too, that was just... <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11152.958s">putting</a>  me in a certain place, like when I listen to music, and I'm sure you can relate to that, like it just puts you somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11158.78s">It's</a>  just like, oh, I just start thinking about things you haven't really thought before or didn't have time to think before. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11165.622s">So</a>  that was a life-changing event. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11167.782s">I</a>  would never imagine that I would be here in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11171.063s">years</a>  later studying with her in person and now professionally working with her to performing, recording, which is really an honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11180.306s">she's</a>  really, she's building the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11182.349s">She's</a>  from Medford and she's indirectly building the Medford community too, and just the women around the world and non-binary musicians as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11191.078s">So</a>  it's, I just, I was playing the song and I was like, wow, this is insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11194.963s">This</a>  is pretty, pretty cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11205.307s">So</a>  the next one we're going to do, we're going to bring it back up a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11208.089s">And</a>  this is Syllogism by Mary Lou Williams. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11211.533s">This</a>  song is not in the book, but there is a song by Mary Lou Williams in the book that's called Pisces, which is from her Zodiac suit, which we actually got to celebrate with Landmark Orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/8QgLvJV1hWE&t=11224.364s">And</a>  so this is Syllogism.</p>
