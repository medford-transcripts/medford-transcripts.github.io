33
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:59,611

35
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:13,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there's at least maybe close to 40 Eagle Scouts that the troop has produced in the 100 years, which is quite remarkable.

00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:16,866

40

42
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:47,048

43
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:53,892

50
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:25,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you could just shake everyone's hand, um, it will pose for a picture.

[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, this is an issue that's come up to me several times over the past seven, eight months.

150
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:15,601
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's something that's getting worse all the time, is the merchants are complaining about people hanging in the square as early as 7, 8 o'clock in the morning, begging people for money at the bus stops, bothering their employees coming to work.

151
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:20,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've also received calls from many residents who

152
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,846
[SPEAKER_09]: When they're in that part of the square, feel threatened.

153
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:37,016
[SPEAKER_09]: And they say it's younger men and women, some of them under the influence of alcohol and drugs, congregating in the Rose Sloan Garden, under where the bus depot is, in front of the stores there.

154
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:43,682
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, it's just not a safe feeling, especially in the evening, too, when they seem to be there.

155
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And they seem to be coming from

156
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:52,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if I'm calling to the police, maybe some of those boarding houses down in the, a couple of boarding houses in the area.

157
00:16:52,516 --> 00:17:02,219
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like if we could request the chief, maybe put someone either maybe on the walking thing for maybe a couple of hours here or there.

158
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:08,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Or have a presence when they see people just lingering around there to move them along.

159
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:13,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Or again, maybe we could have a little bit of foot traffic in there in the early evening.

160
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:20,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And during the morning, it seems to be prevalent in the morning, around that 7, 8 o'clock hour, when people are going to work, that they're getting by the Mr. President.

161
00:17:21,402 --> 00:17:25,787
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, if the Chief could put some more presence there, it would be appreciated.

162
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:27,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good, Councilor.

163
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:27,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

164
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:31,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for bringing this matter forward.

165
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:44,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to move to amend the paper, Mr. President, to ask that we have the Substance Abuse Outreach Council, as part of this resolution, resolution to go down to the area in conjunction with our police department.

166
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:49,083
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that, you know, if there are individuals down there at 7 o'clock in the morning,

167
00:17:49,623 --> 00:18:00,790
[SPEAKER_10]: under the influence of drugs and alcohol, then getting them out of that area is really going to push the problem down the street, but it's not going to actually take care of the initial underlying issue, which is these individuals in the community that need access to treatment.

168
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,673
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Mr. President, I'd ask that they be amended with the Substance Abuse Outreach Council.

169
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:08,556
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion is moved by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Knight.

170
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:09,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President.

171
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:11,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

172
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I, too, have received a couple of complaints.

173
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,601
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems just the last week or two with regards to this issue.

174
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:18,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I did forward the

175
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:29,651
[SPEAKER_07]: one or two emails to the chief of police and hopefully, I haven't got a response yet, but hopefully when we meet with the chief tomorrow, this can be on our agenda for discussion.

176
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:35,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we have a public safety meeting with the mayor's office and the chief of police at 6 p.m.

177
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:43,297
[SPEAKER_07]: tomorrow night, so this is definitely something that needs to be brought up and hopefully get some enforcement down there and obviously have our outreach coordinator.

178
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:45,719
[SPEAKER_07]: see what she can do to help as well.

179
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:51,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thank you for bringing us putting this forward and hopefully we do get a response from the chief.

180
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:53,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

181
00:18:53,385 --> 00:19:09,937
[SPEAKER_15]: So as amended by Councilors night and longer current on the motion of approval, all those in favor, all those opposed on the motion of Councilor Marks, it takes paper number 14,

182
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:13,785
[SPEAKER_15]: 490.

183
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:13,785
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

184
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:15,225
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

185
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:17,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries under suspension.

186
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:26,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Communication from Mayor 16-492, President Dello Russo, members of the Metro City Council, from Mayor Stephanie M. Burke.

187
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:34,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Request to accept grant from Charitable Foundation in accordance with the provisions of General Law, Chapter 44, Paragraph 53-8.

188
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:40,732
[SPEAKER_15]: I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the acceptance of a grant in the amount of

189
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:46,470
[SPEAKER_15]: $250,000 to the City of Medford from the Stanton Foundation.

190
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:56,812
[SPEAKER_15]: The money from this grant will be used to fund the design and engineering of phase one of a dog park at Riverbend Park in Medford and also for the construction of the park.

191
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:02,453
[SPEAKER_15]: The first payment under this grant, which will be used for the design and engineering is $24,065.

192
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:06,054
[SPEAKER_15]: The second payment will be an amount to cover 90% of the heart construction costs

193
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:11,334
[SPEAKER_15]: up to a maximum of $225,000.

194
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:16,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Maximum value of the grant is $250,000.

195
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:25,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia Hunt, Director of Energy and Environment, and members of the community group PAWS for Medford will be in attendance at the meeting.

196
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:31,945
[SPEAKER_15]: To answer any questions, respectfully submitted, yours, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

197
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:39,949
[SPEAKER_15]: So we invite Alicia Hunt up, our Director of Energy and Environment, to address the council, if you would, ma'am.

198
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:41,937
[SPEAKER_15]: please state your name and address for the record.

199
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:46,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, Alicia Hunt, 41 Lawson street, Medford.

200
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:56,984
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, so I want you to know that this has been the work of a community group working very hard to raise money for a dog park in Medford.

201
00:20:57,404 --> 00:21:03,747
[SPEAKER_24]: There were some early money that this, the mayor did obtain through the fast 14 and also through a doggie fun run.

202
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:24,563
[SPEAKER_24]: back in the day, and that money actually helped them, allowed the mayor to hire a consultant to work with them to do a feasibility study around locations, to help provide the sketch that the Stanton Foundation requires for their grant, and to prepare a budget for the construction of this dog park.

203
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:28,824
[SPEAKER_24]: And the community group has been working on this for several years.

204
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:29,965
[SPEAKER_24]: And members of them are here.

205
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:33,446
[SPEAKER_24]: And I actually credit them with discovering the Stanton Foundation.

206
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:47,370
[SPEAKER_24]: The Stanton Foundation is the trust of Peter, the gentleman who used to be one of the founders of CBS, CBS everything, CBS TV, CBS, all of CBS.

207
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:52,412
[SPEAKER_24]: And he left this in trust to take care of his dog and dogs.

208
00:21:52,932 --> 00:22:01,460
[SPEAKER_24]: And so the Stanton Foundation actually only gives grants with relationship to dogs, and in particular, dog parks in the state of Massachusetts.

209
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:16,754
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's a non-competitive grant, which is why we're before you this evening, because under municipal finance law, that is considered a gift, which means that if we meet the requirements of their grant, then they will just give it to us.

210
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:19,016
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a competition between other municipalities.

211
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:28,649
[SPEAKER_24]: So there are members here who got to actually speak much more eloquently to the entire process than I can, and I've simply been providing municipal staff support for their project.

212
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:29,309
[SPEAKER_24]: Awesome.

213
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

214
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks, I know has been very active in this.

215
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:32,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

216
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor?

217
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:35,491
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could, Mr. President.

218
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:35,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

219
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

220
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Alicia Hunt.

221
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:44,133
[SPEAKER_05]: She's been the point person here at City Hall to help assist in moving this project forward.

222
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:46,914
[SPEAKER_05]: It was roughly a year and a half ago

223
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:53,214
[SPEAKER_05]: when a group of citizens, as Alicia mentioned, got together with one common goal.

224
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:57,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goal was to create a dog park in this community.

225
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:15,738
[SPEAKER_05]: At the time, the people that got together felt that the demand was there, felt that the need in the community was there, and felt that if we could organize and request nothing back from the city,

226
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:19,159
[SPEAKER_05]: we may be able to move this proposal forward.

227
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And indeed, that is exactly what happened.

228
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:31,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So on November 3rd, 2014, a group of concerned residents got together at the Danish pastry shop.

229
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:39,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Among coffee and pastry, we discussed our first steps in moving a dog park forward in this community.

230
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:46,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was much discussion and dialogue in the fact that Method registers currently

231
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:56,606
[SPEAKER_05]: about 350 dogs a year for licenses, where surrounding communities register 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 dogs a year.

232
00:23:57,306 --> 00:24:03,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why is that in other communities that do have dog parks, you have to show a license to use the park.

233
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:12,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was an incentive to get a license and to become a concerned, active dog owner in the community.

234
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:14,010
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that mission,

235
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:39,383
[SPEAKER_05]: The one quote that the paper picked up on this a while back, November of 2014, and the very first sentence, I think this is a great sentence in the article, it says, a small group of Medford residents intends to present Mayor Michael McGlynn with such a rock solid plan for the first city's dog park that gives him no choice but to build it.

236
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:42,564
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's exactly what happened.

237
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the group got together

238
00:24:46,826 --> 00:24:53,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Patty was very instrumental, Patty Flynn, in coming up with, yeah, Patty, raise your hand.

239
00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:14,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Patty did her homework of due diligence, and one night of the meeting, she said, you know what, this Stanton Foundation that I researched has funded dog parks in Arlington and Somerville, and they asked for very little but to have a commitment from the city, and we approached Mayor McGlynn early on,

240
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:22,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And the mayor was all ears and listened to everything we had to say and told us to keep on moving forward.

241
00:25:23,717 --> 00:25:26,018
[SPEAKER_05]: We then brought on an organizer.

242
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:31,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone that knows Jim Silva knows that Jim is a grassroots organizer.

243
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:39,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't even know he had a dog at the time, but I picked up the phone, I called him, I said, Jim, what do you think about a dog park in the city?

244
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was down at the first one at the meeting.

245
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:46,280
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was another member of the committee that got together.

246
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:55,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had several meetings over Gary DeStefano's house, who owns two giant, three.

247
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:57,968
[SPEAKER_05]: What type of dogs, Gary?

248
00:25:59,469 --> 00:26:01,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Three giant Labrador retrievers.

249
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:08,976
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm still pulling the hair off my suit from the meeting we had, but don't take it personal.

250
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:10,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't take it personal.

251
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:33,050
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had Brett Fitch, who was another dog owner in the community, John Sardone, and Diane Gitner, another member of the community who did a lot of research on potentially having fundraisers and eventual upkeep of this particular park, which is going to be of discussion down the line.

252
00:26:34,603 --> 00:26:41,889
[SPEAKER_05]: The committee then got together and looked for someone to do site planning and landscape architect.

253
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:49,014
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I believe it was Patty that found Andrew Leonard from Leonard Design Associates.

254
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:56,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And he created the dog park in Arlington and worked on the one in Somerville and a number of dog parks throughout the state.

255
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,185
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was a wealth of information when we sat down and discussed the potential of a dog park in this community.

256
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:11,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And just over time, it started to pick up legs, and I think it got out in the community, and people embraced it.

257
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:14,746
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have, I believe, 23 parks in the city.

258
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:17,426
[SPEAKER_05]: We all see this as the very first step.

259
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:24,568
[SPEAKER_05]: By no means is this an end all, where we say, okay, we have a dog park, we never wanna talk about another dog park in the city.

260
00:27:24,908 --> 00:27:33,690
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first step, and hopefully many dog parks, potentially pop-up dog parks, like other communities do, potentially, as Councilor Knight mentioned,

261
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:43,278
[SPEAKER_05]: about having maybe certain hours dedicated, whether it's early morning hours or late, late hours to have dogs exercise and run free.

262
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:48,421
[SPEAKER_05]: The estimate we got in this city, there's over 5,000 dogs that live in this community.

263
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:52,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's well below what we have in this community.

264
00:27:52,763 --> 00:28:01,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it speaks volumes for the need to have a place where dogs can socialize, dogs can exercise,

265
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:06,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And these particular parks aren't just a gate and a fence to keep a dog in.

266
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,961
[SPEAKER_05]: These parks are going to be able to have the dog use obstacle courses.

267
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:22,905
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be created with the latest technology for filtration systems, lighting, water that's going to be at the site.

268
00:28:22,925 --> 00:28:25,266
[SPEAKER_05]: They're handicap accessible.

269
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:27,867
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be ample parking for residents.

270
00:28:28,587 --> 00:28:31,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really is a win-win for this community.

271
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:41,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think after we move forward on this and take one step further, we could really call ourself as a community, a dog-friendly community.

272
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:47,700
[SPEAKER_05]: We could talk about it, but until we put something into action, I think this is the first line that says, hey, you know what?

273
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,821
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a dog-friendly community in this city.

274
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:53,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to thank all the committee members.

275
00:28:53,423 --> 00:28:57,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Mayor McGlynn for lending us his ear from the very beginning.

276
00:28:57,604 --> 00:28:58,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank

277
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia Hunt for helping us move this forward.

278
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:04,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's still work that needs to be done.

279
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:09,941
[SPEAKER_05]: This by no means is the last stretch of this.

280
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:17,906
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to discuss issues of upkeep and other issues regarding how do we bring this out to the rest of the community.

281
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:25,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I've received a number of phone calls from people that say, you know what, I love a dog park, but I'm not going to get in my car to drive to a dog park.

282
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:27,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to have something more in my neighborhood.

283
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:34,187
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the topics we're going to have to discuss over time, how we can bring this out to the entire community.

284
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:39,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I know there's members of the committee that have done far more work than I have on this.

285
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:48,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think they would like to come up and give us a little on what took place over time and where we'd go from here.

286
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:51,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I want to thank the dog park committee.

287
00:29:53,062 --> 00:29:53,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

288
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:53,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

289
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:55,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Just please say your name and address for the record.

290
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:57,085
[SPEAKER_19]: Chip Silva, 115 Yale Street.

291
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:00,315
[SPEAKER_19]: Do any of you have any questions?

292
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:09,097
[SPEAKER_19]: The history, Michael, I think you've covered all the history of the committee and what we were planning to do.

293
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:15,559
[SPEAKER_19]: How we've reached out to the community is through a website, through a Twitter account as well.

294
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,839
[SPEAKER_19]: And a lot of people have had a lot of positive feedback.

295
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:22,960
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, there are estimates of 5,000 to 9,000 dogs in this community.

296
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:25,341
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think people feel that they want

297
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,443
[SPEAKER_19]: to be able to use parks and recreation in the community.

298
00:30:29,483 --> 00:30:32,566
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody in the community is entitled to doing that.

299
00:30:32,606 --> 00:30:37,671
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is really a centrally located park that allows everybody to come together.

300
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:41,474
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a beginning, a template for other opportunities in the city.

301
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:43,976
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you for your efforts.

302
00:30:43,996 --> 00:30:44,076
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

303
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to know if there are any questions.

304
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:47,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Patty.

305
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:48,020
[SPEAKER_02]: No, come on.

306
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:52,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's time to shine.

307
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:56,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, seriously, does anybody have any concerns, questions?

308
00:30:57,836 --> 00:30:59,617
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, we just want a yes vote.

309
00:30:59,677 --> 00:31:03,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Vice President Longo-Curran.

310
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

311
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:06,801
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of questions.

312
00:31:06,861 --> 00:31:09,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's going to have to do with houseware.

313
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:18,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And do we know what type of square footage we're looking for?

314
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:19,679
[SPEAKER_02]: All the plans are developed.

315
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:20,660
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all designed.

316
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is set.

317
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:24,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the square footage off hand.

318
00:31:24,062 --> 00:31:26,563
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our math guy.

319
00:31:28,324 --> 00:31:29,765
[SPEAKER_02]: He has everything in his head.

320
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So $12,000 to answer your question.

321
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:34,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it still $2,000?

322
00:31:34,948 --> 00:31:35,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's $2,000.

323
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:37,590
[SPEAKER_02]: $12,000 for the large dog park and $4,000 for the smaller one.

324
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:56,470
[SPEAKER_24]: So perhaps it'll be helpful to clarify, um, because as Councilor Marks, um, talked about, there's a filtration that helps them rinse, you know, the, the area regularly, which is why we're not concerned about it being near the river.

325
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,451
[SPEAKER_24]: And with all these things is why a dog park is so expensive.

326
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:04,613
[SPEAKER_24]: And in fact, what we have is a schematic and a budget in the first $25,000 roughly.

327
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:09,893
[SPEAKER_24]: Is to do the design and engineering of what we have.

328
00:32:10,274 --> 00:32:10,954
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a laid out.

329
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:13,235
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a sketch now and that needs to be engineered.

330
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:15,096
[SPEAKER_24]: We've had a survey done of the property.

331
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:27,821
[SPEAKER_24]: So this amount will cover the design and engineering and then we would go out to bid and we will automatically get the grant for the construction as long as we put it out to bid and

332
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:32,036
[SPEAKER_24]: That will cover the 12,000-square-foot dog park.

333
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:36,997
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a design to have next to it a 4,000-square-foot small dog park.

334
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:44,298
[SPEAKER_24]: That actually is more than we can afford at this time and would actually be an additional $175,000 total.

335
00:32:44,318 --> 00:32:45,438
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, actually $100,000 total to bring 92,690

336
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,402
[SPEAKER_24]: for phase two to do that piece.

337
00:32:56,742 --> 00:33:08,250
[SPEAKER_24]: So the current design has a fence, fencing off part of the 12,000 square foot and a gate inside of it so that you can have a small dog park and a large dog within the 12,000 square feet.

338
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:18,977
[SPEAKER_24]: And then this group intends to continue to pursue funding and fundraising for the rest of, for the section, the second piece of it, which would be the 4,000 square foot area.

339
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:22,900
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we would remove the gate in the middle as that seemed to be

340
00:33:23,322 --> 00:33:24,203
[SPEAKER_24]: appropriate to do.

341
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:25,864
[SPEAKER_24]: The dog owners agree.

342
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:26,825
[SPEAKER_24]: So.

343
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:31,228
[SPEAKER_07]: And with regards to the grant, was it your department that filled out the grant?

344
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:45,078
[SPEAKER_24]: It was so remarkably simple that we had a lot of questions back from our finance office, but literally we sent them a letter of intent saying that the mayor supports this and the city agrees to this location.

345
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:47,519
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm sorry, there's feedback on there, I think.

346
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,012
[SPEAKER_24]: We sent them the budget, and we sent them the schematic.

347
00:33:51,252 --> 00:33:52,433
[SPEAKER_24]: That was literally it.

348
00:33:52,473 --> 00:33:53,773
[SPEAKER_24]: There was no argument.

349
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:58,357
[SPEAKER_24]: There was no pages and pages of prose, as we typically do for a grant.

350
00:33:58,457 --> 00:33:59,517
[SPEAKER_24]: It was a one-page letter.

351
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:03,260
[SPEAKER_24]: And it is a max of $250,000 per community?

352
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:03,800
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

353
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:12,266
[SPEAKER_24]: And in fact, we kind of argued with them a lot, trying to advocate for a larger amount, saying that they set that $250,000 several years ago, and that with inflation and costs

354
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,252
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's a good point.

355
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:19,593
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's a good point.

356
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:40,138
[SPEAKER_24]: receptive at this time, but it is a private foundation and they fund dog parks and canine units.

357
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:47,560
[SPEAKER_24]: There's no reason why they couldn't in the future change their minds, but they're under no regulation to do it.

358
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,120
[SPEAKER_24]: They do provide funds.

359
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I want just to interject just a little bit.

360
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:59,542
[SPEAKER_24]: They do provide yearly funds, I think up to three years for maintenance, restoration, additional capital money.

361
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:03,643
[SPEAKER_24]: You can get money every, they actually expect to give you additional money

362
00:35:04,123 --> 00:35:08,185
[SPEAKER_24]: in the first three years for things that you additionally need.

363
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:11,887
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, it's about $10,000 a year, roughly.

364
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:13,768
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't actually jot that number down.

365
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:15,188
[SPEAKER_24]: But yeah.

366
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:20,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And then with regards to the fundraising from the FAST-14 and then the Doggy Fun Run, right?

367
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it was a fundraiser, too.

368
00:35:22,992 --> 00:35:23,992
[SPEAKER_07]: How much does that amount?

369
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:35,990
[SPEAKER_24]: $46,000.

370
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:35,990
[SPEAKER_24]: And so their grant actually covers only hard capital costs of construction.

371
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:43,892
[SPEAKER_24]: And so any good construction plan includes general conditions and contingency.

372
00:35:44,432 --> 00:35:46,513
[SPEAKER_24]: And they will not cover that in their grant.

373
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:48,594
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have that cushion.

374
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:53,275
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's also they provide 90% of whatever our bid price is.

375
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:54,856
[SPEAKER_24]: So whatever comes in the bid, $250,000 max.

376
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:58,757
[SPEAKER_24]: So if our bid came in at $260,000, they would look at the $250,000, give us 90% of that, which is $225,000.

377
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:13,234
[SPEAKER_24]: And we have to guarantee that 10% to the $25,000 there we need to provide.

378
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:16,275
[SPEAKER_24]: So we've been able to say that we have this 46,000.

379
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:20,096
[SPEAKER_24]: So we, that'll be our 10% of the hard construction costs.

380
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:22,017
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we look at some of that money.

381
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:26,998
[SPEAKER_24]: for any contingency general conditions, things that might not come up.

382
00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:31,864
[SPEAKER_24]: Apparently, actually, they needed us to explain, they actually called and asked a few questions.

383
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:38,312
[SPEAKER_24]: Apparently, lighting isn't typical, which I don't comprehend, because when you want to take your dog after dark,

384
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:52,398
[SPEAKER_24]: particularly in the winter, so they needed me to like verbally justify why we included lighting in our bid, and I was like, in our costs, and I was like, because you want to take your dog after five o'clock in the winter time.

385
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:57,680
[SPEAKER_24]: So there were a few things like that we had to explain to them.

386
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

387
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:00,302
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my questions for now.

388
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:05,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to thank you, Alicia, for all your hard work, and of course, pause for men for a minute.

389
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:09,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember clearly coming before us begging for a dog park.

390
00:37:10,816 --> 00:37:16,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think after that meeting, the petition was started, and I know Councilmarks got on board.

391
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:22,199
[SPEAKER_07]: The council was supportive, but Councilmarks went above and beyond and really helped you out.

392
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,559
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to thank all that are involved.

393
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,760
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said Alicia, yeah.

394
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is great.

395
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I think everybody really came together, and I'm just really excited.

396
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:36,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Last question, do we have a time frame, or what is the plan?

397
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:41,208
[SPEAKER_24]: actually do a request for qualifications for a designer.

398
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,275
[SPEAKER_24]: So that is because of the cost of the designer being, we'll need to do that.

399
00:37:47,636 --> 00:37:48,677
[SPEAKER_24]: So we'll need to put that out.

400
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:52,462
[SPEAKER_24]: And as you might know, municipal procurement takes some time.

401
00:37:52,982 --> 00:37:59,284
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm actually still clarifying what our situation is, as we're between procurement officers right now and it is budget season.

402
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:06,946
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't actually anticipate being able to do that in the next couple of weeks, because the finance staff is pretty tracked to that.

403
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:09,026
[SPEAKER_24]: He will do a design.

404
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:10,787
[SPEAKER_24]: We would then put it out to bid.

405
00:38:11,187 --> 00:38:15,928
[SPEAKER_24]: It is our goal that we would actually go to, it's my hope that we could actually go to construction

406
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:17,088
[SPEAKER_24]: next spring.

407
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:28,453
[SPEAKER_24]: If we could do it this fall, that would be fabulous, but I know that each time you go out to bid takes at least four to six weeks just in the bid process alone, let alone the actual work of designing it.

408
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:34,275
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm a little not sure, and obviously we wouldn't be able to do construction of a park in the winter.

409
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:36,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

410
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,180
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

411
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

412
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

413
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:43,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I've been a dog owner for probably 35 years.

414
00:38:44,062 --> 00:38:48,064
And I want to thank this group for the remarkable work they've done.

415
00:38:48,764 --> 00:38:53,166
And it just goes to show what a community can do.

416
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:55,007
They really want to do it.

417
00:38:55,147 --> 00:38:56,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I've known Gary for many years.

418
00:38:56,889 --> 00:39:05,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to see Gary at 5 o'clock in the morning with his two dogs and get coffee and eat and go off and do all kinds of stuff.

419
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:08,399
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jimmy I know is a great, you know, architecture thing.

420
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And Patty, you know, a great man.

421
00:39:11,222 --> 00:39:14,945
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I think Councilman Marks has to be commended here.

422
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:16,907
[SPEAKER_09]: He took it all away from me.

423
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:23,051
[SPEAKER_09]: If you would, please state your name and address for the record.

424
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:23,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

425
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:26,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

426
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:49,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to thank very much the folks who have put together and made the dog park almost happen.

427
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:57,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say happen, but it's gone on.

428
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:01,431
[SPEAKER_06]: There are two reasons, both related to my guide dog, why I'm really excited about this.

429
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And you may notice I'm missing somebody tonight.

430
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:05,801
[SPEAKER_06]: He's fine.

431
00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:06,761
[SPEAKER_06]: He's alive and well.

432
00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:11,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll explain in a second why I'm missing him, but it is related.

433
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:16,348
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, as you know, I have a guide dog.

434
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:26,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you may be able to tell, guide work and any kind of service dog work, but guide work, particularly in a city environment, I work downtown, is extremely stressful.

435
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:32,778
[SPEAKER_06]: A working dog is generally a happy dog, but it takes a huge toll on the dog, and in fact,

436
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:38,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Guide dogs working in the city generally retire a couple years earlier than guide dogs who work in more rural locations.

437
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, I literally put my life in his paws.

438
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:48,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if you've noticed, but navigating around the city can be a little stressful sometimes.

439
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So, not this one specifically, but A-City.

440
00:40:51,502 --> 00:41:00,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So, some people, there are people with service dogs who do not take their dogs to dog parks, and that's fine, and I understand why they might not.

441
00:41:00,907 --> 00:41:04,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I do, because I have a really high energy dog, and he needs to blow off steam.

442
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:13,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is really, really helpful to the quality of his work to be able to have a place where he can run around and be a dog.

443
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:27,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a yard, it's not huge, you know, but having a place where he can romp and play and just run and run and run, because my dog loves to run, is really, it contributes to the quality of his work and therefore to my safety.

444
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:38,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, it's very nice to know that that is coming here to Medford and that I don't have to, you know, schlep over to Somerville or Cambridge or wherever to get it done, because I'd really rather do it here.

445
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:41,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I like taking him to the dog park.

446
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:52,790
[SPEAKER_06]: The other reasoning is that it's my hope that if dogs are running loose in the dog park, they are less likely to be running loose elsewhere, because they will have a place to do this.

447
00:41:54,291 --> 00:42:00,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I live near Royal Park, and I often use the bus stop that's in front of there.

448
00:42:00,194 --> 00:42:05,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And up until recently, when they took the gates off, there were often dogs running in there.

449
00:42:06,923 --> 00:42:10,885
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can see the sign that says, don't let your dogs run in here, I'm pretty sure everybody else can.

450
00:42:14,107 --> 00:42:26,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a little difficult because using the bus stop and trying to navigate that intersection, which is a little hairy on a good day, my dog would see dogs playing.

451
00:42:27,053 --> 00:42:32,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And in areas where they weren't supposed to be and where I would not let him play because I didn't want him to associate

452
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,091
[SPEAKER_06]: bus stop with play.

453
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted him to be able to navigate me there and work.

454
00:42:38,414 --> 00:42:48,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why he's not here right now is because he is back at the guide dog school getting refresher training because he has developed a problem with dog distraction.

455
00:42:51,242 --> 00:42:53,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really hard.

456
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:59,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, that's the kind of thing that can land someone under a truck if it happens at the wrong time.

457
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:07,604
[SPEAKER_06]: And his dog distraction has been exacerbated by the fact that we have been attacked by off-leash dogs twice since I got him.

458
00:43:07,664 --> 00:43:08,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had him just under three years.

459
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:25,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is my hope that, again, that if people are able to use the dog park, that maybe they'll be less likely to be walking around with their dogs off-leash, or maybe they'll be less likely to have their dogs

460
00:43:26,381 --> 00:43:37,570
[SPEAKER_06]: playing off leash in places where it's really a safety risk to other people and their dogs, particularly those of us whose dogs are responsible in part for our safety and independence.

461
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:41,593
[SPEAKER_06]: My dog is going to be gone for a few weeks.

462
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know when he's coming back.

463
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:50,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And when he comes back, I still don't know whether they will have been able to train this issue out of him.

464
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,743
[SPEAKER_06]: If they can't, I have to apply for another dog.

465
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:57,187
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really hard for me.

466
00:43:57,527 --> 00:43:57,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

467
00:43:58,908 --> 00:44:07,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also, just if you want to get down to basic economics, which is not usually how I roll, a waste of a $50,000 dog.

468
00:44:09,674 --> 00:44:20,460
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to thank you very much for doing things that hopefully will make the streets safer for me, for my guide dog, and for other service dog teams, because right now,

469
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:25,427
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the more — right now, without those, they are less safe.

470
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:29,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully, with the more of those there, the safer things will be.

471
00:44:30,148 --> 00:44:30,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

472
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:31,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Rachel.

473
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:34,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Ma'am.

474
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:36,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

475
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

476
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:46,232
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that all of us behind this rail have been very supportive of the initiatives of Paws for Medford and the initiatives to bring a dog park into the city.

477
00:44:46,832 --> 00:44:51,193
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a paper before us here that's giving us free money, and I don't think anybody behind this rail is going to be opposed to that.

478
00:44:51,724 --> 00:45:01,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so with that being said, Mr. President, I'd move for approval, but, um, we'll give them as far as we get an opportunity to speak, but I think, um, on the motion for approval by council at night, ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

479
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:01,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

480
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez at 21 park street.

481
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:06,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had questions.

482
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:09,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that we could ask questions about the park.

483
00:45:10,515 --> 00:45:10,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

484
00:45:11,397 --> 00:45:13,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm concerned about the proximity to the school.

485
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:22,305
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if it's going to be closed during school hours, like the cable access, because these children are younger and more vulnerable than the high school students that that rule is protecting.

486
00:45:22,325 --> 00:45:32,293
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if there's going to be dedicated parking for this, because anyone who's been to that school campus knows that those lots are overflowing during school hours, approximately between 7 a.m.

487
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:33,014
[SPEAKER_00]: and 3 p.m.

488
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:35,896
[SPEAKER_00]: So are teachers going to be displaced?

489
00:45:35,976 --> 00:45:41,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I know if you have a sick child at this school, it's nearly impossible to pick your child up because you can't park your car.

490
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:53,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering what the water bill will be to the city for the filtration, the cost of electricity to have lights on at night that we don't have on in the other parks because the local parks don't have lights at night.

491
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:58,353
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if maybe those questions can be answered so we have more perspective.

492
00:45:58,733 --> 00:45:59,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

493
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:01,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia, if you could.

494
00:46:07,388 --> 00:46:11,030
[SPEAKER_24]: So we actually, I'm sorry that I don't have a large map of the area.

495
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,591
[SPEAKER_24]: It was actually my goal to have the map of the area, but I don't.

496
00:46:16,492 --> 00:46:18,693
[SPEAKER_24]: Couldn't get it printed, the plotter, this evening.

497
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:28,697
[SPEAKER_24]: But we looked at two areas in Riverbend Park, and one is the open area by the wind turbine that's sort of right across two paths from the playground and the school.

498
00:46:29,297 --> 00:46:34,319
[SPEAKER_24]: And we deemed that that was actually not a good location because you could see it from the school playground.

499
00:46:34,686 --> 00:46:35,607
[SPEAKER_24]: And that would be a problem.

500
00:46:36,008 --> 00:46:43,740
[SPEAKER_24]: So this location is actually further back under the trees past behind the garden.

501
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:48,528
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's right at more like at the tip of the parking lot between the two schools.

502
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,617
[SPEAKER_24]: And you pretty much can't see it from the schools.

503
00:46:53,078 --> 00:46:59,420
[SPEAKER_24]: It's my understanding and experience that people walk through down the paths constantly as it is now with their dogs.

504
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,881
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a very popular dog walking area.

505
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:09,704
[SPEAKER_24]: But now they'll be coming back to this area under the trees and not letting their dogs run in the grassy open area by the wind turbine.

506
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:14,286
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's designed to be screened by the trees.

507
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:15,707
[SPEAKER_24]: You can see it from the school.

508
00:47:18,824 --> 00:47:23,646
[SPEAKER_24]: The budget does include some amount of putting in a water line and putting in all of that.

509
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:34,813
[SPEAKER_24]: But then there will be water to rinse the area, just like we irrigate a lot of our center islands and various places just for beauty.

510
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:47,420
[SPEAKER_24]: This will actually be used water for cleaning the ground, rinsing stuff into the surface so that it doesn't flow off the surface into the river nearby.

511
00:47:49,386 --> 00:47:50,667
[SPEAKER_24]: And we'll put in LED lighting.

512
00:47:51,107 --> 00:48:04,650
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I'm in charge of it, like, of course, I mean, charge is a strong word, but we have an agreement in the city that we will not install non-LED lighting unless there is a very important reason to do so at this point, so.

513
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:05,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

514
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:13,513
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also, with our municipal aggregation, with municipal aggregation, we have discounted electrical rates.

515
00:48:13,753 --> 00:48:14,353
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.

516
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:14,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

517
00:48:15,668 --> 00:48:20,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to address the new concerns about being the proximity to children.

518
00:48:21,913 --> 00:48:23,334
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could, Director Ross.

519
00:48:23,354 --> 00:48:23,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

520
00:48:23,635 --> 00:48:26,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

521
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:35,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So the proximity to the children, I definitely, we had addressed this with the school committee because we felt that there may be concerns that arise.

522
00:48:35,284 --> 00:48:36,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't there be?

523
00:48:37,545 --> 00:48:39,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Alicia said, it's going to be set.

524
00:48:39,387 --> 00:48:40,788
[SPEAKER_02]: There are going to be trees placed.

525
00:48:41,347 --> 00:48:42,709
[SPEAKER_02]: There are trees moved around.

526
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:45,553
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be placed so it's going to be separate.

527
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:47,096
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to be able to see the park.

528
00:48:47,697 --> 00:48:49,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, there's a double gated system.

529
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,322
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog goes into the park.

530
00:48:51,482 --> 00:48:52,204
[SPEAKER_02]: The gate shuts.

531
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:56,583
[SPEAKER_02]: The owner takes the leash off of the dog, enters the park.

532
00:48:57,063 --> 00:49:00,645
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog's not going to be off leash at all, sorry.

533
00:49:01,365 --> 00:49:06,207
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog's not going to be off leash and able to run around where there are children.

534
00:49:07,467 --> 00:49:15,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Arlington's dog park is right next to a playground and two fields where they play soccer, lacrosse,

535
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:19,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe there may be a baseball field down the way.

536
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,227
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't had any incidents.

537
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:23,068
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been there for years.

538
00:49:23,748 --> 00:49:24,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

539
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be open during school hours.

540
00:49:27,471 --> 00:49:29,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Parking is definitely a problem there.

541
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a mother of four, and my four children went there.

542
00:49:32,835 --> 00:49:33,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm well aware of it.

543
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:36,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Hormel has an overflow lot.

544
00:49:36,678 --> 00:49:39,300
[SPEAKER_02]: There is multiple parking spots there.

545
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:41,201
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to be an issue.

546
00:49:43,403 --> 00:49:43,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

547
00:49:44,444 --> 00:49:46,025
[SPEAKER_15]: You all set, Madam Vice President?

548
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:47,462
[SPEAKER_07]: You can ask one question.

549
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

550
00:49:49,283 --> 00:49:49,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

551
00:49:50,264 --> 00:49:59,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the chair, with regards to being open during school hours, have the principals been updated and been able to give their concerns and ask questions?

552
00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:07,773
[SPEAKER_24]: The group went to the school committee in the fall, but did not specifically, to the best of my knowledge, contact the principals at all.

553
00:50:08,733 --> 00:50:09,954
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's correct.

554
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:14,076
[SPEAKER_24]: We understand that there's no parking abutting the park during school hours.

555
00:50:14,438 --> 00:50:28,022
[SPEAKER_24]: It's my understanding that most dog owners take their dogs to a park like this before work and after work, and that the ones who are coming in the middle of the day tend to have the time to park at Hormel Stadium and walk down the pathway.

556
00:50:28,782 --> 00:50:32,823
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could just make a suggestion with regards to- Point of information, Councilor Knight.

557
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:38,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there are any restrictions or preclusions right now for people utilizing the public park that is Riverbend Park right now.

558
00:50:38,724 --> 00:50:41,285
[SPEAKER_10]: The parks department set the hours as to when the park's going to be open.

559
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:43,947
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are no preclusions right now from anybody using the park.

560
00:50:43,967 --> 00:50:53,314
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think there'd be any necessary preclusions later on for people to use the park and restrict their access to a dog park if there's no restrictions right now for them to do recreational activities at that location as well.

561
00:50:53,394 --> 00:50:55,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they're just going to be doing those recreational activities with their animal.

562
00:50:56,477 --> 00:50:56,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

563
00:50:57,478 --> 00:50:58,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President.

564
00:50:58,278 --> 00:50:58,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

565
00:50:58,899 --> 00:51:03,823
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could just suggest to maybe discuss it with the principals, just have a conversation.

566
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:04,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get a call.

567
00:51:05,024 --> 00:51:06,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it was a couple months ago.

568
00:51:06,305 --> 00:51:09,047
[SPEAKER_07]: This story might have been in the newspaper.

569
00:51:09,657 --> 00:51:10,218
[SPEAKER_07]: from a teacher.

570
00:51:10,398 --> 00:51:20,846
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it is definitely valid that just to talk to the principals, make sure they don't have any concerns and ease their fears and maybe have them discuss it with the teacher, see what the teacher's questions are.

571
00:51:20,866 --> 00:51:21,786
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be great.

572
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:22,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

573
00:51:23,328 --> 00:51:26,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

574
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:30,893
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this wasn't the only site that was looked at.

575
00:51:31,033 --> 00:51:37,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, Mayor McGlynn did an extensive survey and looked at a number of parks throughout the community.

576
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:45,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And we kept on arriving at this particular park based on information we received from residents throughout the community.

577
00:51:45,765 --> 00:51:50,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think one of the issues that was made mention is the safety of the children.

578
00:51:50,568 --> 00:51:52,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's always our first priority.

579
00:51:53,430 --> 00:52:01,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think what we have now are dog owners, responsible dog owners that go down there, take the leash off their dog, and allow their dogs to run around free now.

580
00:52:02,376 --> 00:52:05,478
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're saying is we're going to create a confined area

581
00:52:06,235 --> 00:52:07,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So dogs aren't going to be running around.

582
00:52:08,117 --> 00:52:11,259
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, dogs are running around there without leashes now.

583
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to create a confined area that will house these dogs so you won't have that.

584
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:22,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And you won't have it in other parks that now there's a place where dogs can run in a confined area.

585
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:30,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think regarding safety, I think we've really did our homework and our due diligence.

586
00:52:31,396 --> 00:52:32,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a great question.

587
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:38,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this adds safety to the area, not detracts from it, to be quite honest with you.

588
00:52:38,748 --> 00:52:39,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

589
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:44,513
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

590
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:45,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, before you call the roll.

591
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:48,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Marks, Councilor Marks.

592
00:52:48,976 --> 00:52:50,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the one last thing, Mr. President.

593
00:52:50,678 --> 00:53:02,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's great when we have active volunteers in this community that step up and give hundreds of hours of their own personal time to put such a project together.

594
00:53:03,155 --> 00:53:16,360
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask, respectfully, Mr. President, that we add just a B paper or an A paper onto this, asking that the mayor create a dog park committee, which will be needed in this community.

595
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:19,101
[SPEAKER_05]: This was an informal dog park committee.

596
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:32,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask, respectfully to the mayor, that the mayor appoint each one of the members that I mentioned, Patty Flynn, Jim Silva, Gary DiStefano, Diane Gittner, Britt Fitch, and John Sardone,

597
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,951
[SPEAKER_05]: to the dog park committee.

598
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:37,932
[SPEAKER_05]: And that'd be a formal committee created by the mayor.

599
00:53:38,253 --> 00:53:42,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if they opt not to serve on it because of all the hours they already spent, that's fine.

600
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:54,481
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think with the wealth of knowledge we have, Mr. President, with this group, and to address some of the issues that were mentioned tonight, and to have a group that oversees this.

601
00:53:55,121 --> 00:53:56,002
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a park commission.

602
00:53:56,022 --> 00:53:56,882
[SPEAKER_05]: They do great work.

603
00:53:57,242 --> 00:53:58,823
[SPEAKER_05]: But this would be a dog park committee.

604
00:53:59,347 --> 00:54:07,289
[SPEAKER_05]: that would pursue outside funding, a dog park community that would look at establishing other dog parks in neighborhoods throughout the community.

605
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:12,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would hate to see this group disperse after this, Mr. President.

606
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,511
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to lure them back in.

607
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's rail them back in.

608
00:54:15,851 --> 00:54:20,112
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion as a B paper of Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

609
00:54:20,512 --> 00:54:21,352
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor.

610
00:54:21,612 --> 00:54:23,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

611
00:54:23,453 --> 00:54:24,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion is approved.

612
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:25,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote.

613
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:29,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote has been asked on the B paper.

614
00:54:37,093 --> 00:54:41,917
[SPEAKER_15]: B paper for the establishment, requesting the mayor establish a dog park committee.

615
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,699
[SPEAKER_15]: We're gonna, you asked for a B paper.

616
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we are voting on the B paper, which we have just done.

617
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,665
[SPEAKER_15]: And on the main motion was gonna have a roll call vote, councillor.

618
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:53,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

619
00:54:54,192 --> 00:54:55,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your kindness.

620
00:54:56,012 --> 00:54:57,293
[SPEAKER_13]: On the B paper.

621
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:57,633

00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

625
00:55:01,014 --> 00:55:01,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

626
00:55:01,354 --> 00:55:02,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice-President Long-Term.

627
00:55:02,154 --> 00:55:02,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

628
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:03,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

629
00:55:03,974 --> 00:55:04,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

00:55:04,455 --> 00:55:05,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

631
00:55:05,255 --> 00:55:05,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_13]: President Dello Russo.

633
00:55:06,935 --> 00:55:07,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

634
00:55:08,656 --> 00:55:10,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

635
00:55:10,876 --> 00:55:12,016
[SPEAKER_15]: The B paper passes.

636
00:55:12,537 --> 00:55:19,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Now a roll call on the main motion offered by Councilor, approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

638
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,460

00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:27,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

00:55:28,221 --> 00:55:28,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

647
00:55:39,124 --> 00:55:51,967
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're under suspension, 16491, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body

648
00:55:52,445 --> 00:56:04,556
[SPEAKER_15]: approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $500,000 for the purpose of replacing sidewalks and related stumps throughout the city.

649
00:56:05,116 --> 00:56:09,260
[SPEAKER_15]: The balance and certified cash free cash prior to this vote is $8,687,775.

650
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,662
[SPEAKER_15]: The interim commissioner of the Department of Public Works

651
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:24,552
[SPEAKER_15]: The Right Honorable Brian Kerins will be present to answer any questions you may have.

652
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:28,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Sincerely yours, Stephanie M. Burke, Common Mayor.

653
00:56:29,654 --> 00:56:32,495
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Commissioner, if you would, please present to us on this.

654
00:56:33,436 --> 00:56:38,238
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much, Mr. President, Madam Vice President, and members of the Council.

655
00:56:39,558 --> 00:56:45,201
[SPEAKER_17]: The Department of Public Works, one of their primary responsibilities is the maintenance and upkeep of

656
00:56:46,132 --> 00:56:53,016
[SPEAKER_17]: The arterial system within the city as well as the sidewalks and the street trees that lie within.

657
00:56:54,497 --> 00:57:05,985
[SPEAKER_17]: The sidewalk condition over the years as well as the roadways due to weather and wear and tear, we have an ongoing replacement program.

658
00:57:06,895 --> 00:57:21,358
[SPEAKER_17]: And currently, you know, we're requesting additional funding to keep that program going to replace the sidewalks that are deteriorating in front of either businesses or residential.

659
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:36,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Presently, as of today, we've received 554 requests to have sidewalks replaced in front of either a place of business or residential.

660
00:57:37,205 --> 00:57:43,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, that breakdown could be concrete, it could be asphalt, possibly brick.

661
00:57:44,408 --> 00:57:57,512
[SPEAKER_17]: But in addition to that, a lot of these places also have tree stumps from trees that were removed at some point in time either through disease or age or mother nature.

662
00:57:58,672 --> 00:58:06,015
[SPEAKER_17]: That would also include removing the stumps that are there and also, you know, then replacing the sidewalk in kind.

663
00:58:07,107 --> 00:58:14,055
[SPEAKER_17]: The city, just as a quick snapshot, has 84.38 miles of public street.

664
00:58:14,516 --> 00:58:15,377
[SPEAKER_17]: That's public street.

665
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:21,364
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to get into the private ways, that's 30.98 miles for a total of 115.36 miles of actual roadway.

666
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:39,516
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, breaking that out, okay, on the public streets, you might say, all right, that, you know, out of the 84.38, probably, all right, you know, 80 miles of that also have sidewalks of various types.

667
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:52,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, the total number of streets, all right, is 450 actual streets, and those are public ways, and 269 private ways within the city for an area that's 8.6 miles.

668
00:58:59,141 --> 00:59:07,184
[SPEAKER_17]: This would be an ongoing, it would be, you know, obviously for public safety, but also for the quality of life for the residents of Medford.

669
00:59:07,984 --> 00:59:08,324
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

670
00:59:11,245 --> 00:59:12,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

671
00:59:12,906 --> 00:59:20,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Kearns, do you have a list of which stumps and street sidewalks will be done with the $500,000?

672
00:59:20,369 --> 00:59:23,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I do, Madam Vice President, right here.

673
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:27,171
[SPEAKER_17]: It's broken down by the location.

674
00:59:28,134 --> 00:59:32,116
[SPEAKER_17]: who placed the call, their phone number, and then also what ward and precinct.

675
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:35,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the ones that will be done with the $500,000?

676
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's correct.

677
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:44,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So how many out of the 554 sidewalks that have been added to the list will be done?

678
00:59:44,883 --> 00:59:53,708
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, what we'll do is if this money is approved, the contract would be put right out onto the street, put on a fast track,

679
00:59:54,676 --> 01:00:02,778
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, we would work up to once the inclement weather, you know, gets, you know, close, then we'd have to shut down and then pick up in the spring.

680
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:19,543
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have to say, I mean, if this number were to hold, okay, and again, depending on prices, on bids, all right, you know, which is a key factor here, we could, you know, probably I'd have to say, you know, a good 75% of the number I just gave you would be done.

681
01:00:19,924 --> 01:00:24,765
[SPEAKER_17]: And that would all, but again, that would depend also on what the bid prices come in at the time.

682
01:00:26,906 --> 01:00:28,387
[SPEAKER_07]: So can we take a look at that?

683
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:29,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly.

684
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:40,390
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there's going to be 25% of the 554 sidewalks not replaced, how are we deciding which ones will be done last?

685
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:44,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's a number, Madam Vice Chairman, through experience.

686
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:46,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, it would all go back to

687
01:00:47,232 --> 01:01:06,663
[SPEAKER_17]: what the actual bid price is as they come in, you know, how much money I would be left, because again, you're talking, you know, prevailing wages, of course, but in addition to that, the price of asphalt and concrete at the time, what it would be per ton or per yard would depend on how far we could stretch it.

688
01:01:11,326 --> 01:01:12,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Superintendent, is that your,

689
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,686
[SPEAKER_15]: your personal copy of those.

690
01:01:15,746 --> 01:01:16,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's fine.

691
01:01:16,427 --> 01:01:26,733
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'd be more than happy to run off and furnish everybody, uh, you know, copies, you know, obviously wish I'm sure someone will make that motion at some point during this deliberation.

692
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:30,396
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we'll eagerly await those in our next week's council packet.

693
01:01:30,836 --> 01:01:31,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a problem.

694
01:01:32,437 --> 01:01:40,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So on this list, they were, they have all been looked at and there are prior ones that are listed as priority worse, worse condition versus,

695
01:01:40,815 --> 01:01:42,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly, exactly.

696
01:01:42,216 --> 01:01:46,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a number scale, like a one through 10 on how dangerous levels?

697
01:01:47,118 --> 01:01:50,199
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, there's usually a remark written beside them.

698
01:01:50,459 --> 01:01:57,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Most generally, Madam Vice Chair, they're all in deteriorating condition.

699
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:09,007
[SPEAKER_17]: The only thing that we would have to make a decision of is, if we go on a particular street and there's one or two requests, the entire street is examined.

700
01:02:10,339 --> 01:02:23,029
[SPEAKER_17]: And even though maybe the residents or the businesses may have not requested a sidewalk, but we find it's deteriorated, there was a tree trip there or whatever, we're obviously gonna have to address those as well.

701
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:31,035
[SPEAKER_17]: So even though we're gonna go and address all of those that are riding there, that list could also grow.

702
01:02:33,677 --> 01:02:36,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And this list is done by alphabetical order based on the street name?

703
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:38,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's correct.

704
01:02:38,673 --> 01:02:42,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And then how many stumps need to be removed in our city?

705
01:02:42,094 --> 01:02:52,696
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a column on the far right-hand side, Madam Vice-Chair, that indicates, you know, whether it's a tree removal stump, you know, on there.

706
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:58,777
[SPEAKER_17]: We are doing those internally with our own forestry.

707
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:01,098
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's a continuing program.

708
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:04,979
[SPEAKER_17]: But where a lot of sidewalks may have been potentially either

709
01:03:07,053 --> 01:03:10,274
[SPEAKER_17]: destroyed over years with the age of the tree that may have been there.

710
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:21,198
[SPEAKER_17]: We cannot remove those in-house for fear of either disturbing the street or maybe the utilities that may be underground.

711
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:25,219
[SPEAKER_17]: It could be gas, water or sewer that may be intertwined with tree roots.

712
01:03:27,786 --> 01:03:29,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we get scanned a copy of this?

713
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:32,089
[SPEAKER_07]: It's huge, so yeah, if we could get a scanned copy.

714
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:39,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam Vice Chair, if you wish, you can keep my copy and I can, you know, I'll be making additional copies anyway for the council.

715
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:49,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Amendment to this paper that the council received a listing of the operative list of sidewalks, trees, and stumps that need attention.

716
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:55,965
[SPEAKER_07]: And then with regards to pricing, I mean, does one square of a sidewalk, what are we pricing that at?

717
01:03:56,352 --> 01:04:01,814
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, the concrete is in yards, the asphalt would be by the ton.

718
01:04:02,895 --> 01:04:15,360
[SPEAKER_17]: What the actual price would be today, Madam Vice Chair, I couldn't tell you for sure, but I can make a few phone calls and get a general idea of what it would be.

719
01:04:19,142 --> 01:04:22,183
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems great to be able to replace, it seems almost

720
01:04:26,443 --> 01:04:27,464
[SPEAKER_07]: unrealistic for just the $500,000.

721
01:04:27,744 --> 01:04:36,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know we've had bonds with $750,000 bond one time, and I know we didn't even replace half that amount.

722
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:37,529
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I asked.

723
01:04:37,549 --> 01:04:39,450
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can understand that.

724
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:42,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this is a lengthy, lengthy list.

725
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:44,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

726
01:04:44,253 --> 01:04:44,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

727
01:04:45,074 --> 01:04:46,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

728
01:04:46,414 --> 01:04:47,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

729
01:04:48,075 --> 01:04:53,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to see that we finally decided to reinvest some money back into our community for something.

730
01:04:53,899 --> 01:04:55,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, in my four years on the council,

731
01:04:56,593 --> 01:05:00,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been here before when we've appropriated bonds to get this done.

732
01:05:01,095 --> 01:05:08,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I know it never covered enough, but Mr. Kearns, is this going to be done in-house or subcontracted out?

733
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:11,078
[SPEAKER_17]: No, this will be done by a contractor.

734
01:05:11,118 --> 01:05:14,239
[SPEAKER_17]: We have insufficient manpower in-house to do it.

735
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,800
[SPEAKER_17]: And the stumps going to be outside sourced also?

736
01:05:18,941 --> 01:05:24,523
[SPEAKER_17]: The contract for the replacement sidewalks will also include an item for stump removal.

737
01:05:25,205 --> 01:05:26,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and we expect to get this started?

738
01:05:27,485 --> 01:05:29,126
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

739
01:05:30,146 --> 01:05:36,087
[SPEAKER_17]: If the funds are approved, we'll pull a contract and get it on a fast track.

740
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:38,468
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll probably get it out on the street within a couple of weeks.

741
01:05:38,888 --> 01:05:39,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

742
01:05:39,448 --> 01:05:42,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, does this have to go through the procurement process?

743
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:44,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, it would have to run through that.

744
01:05:44,389 --> 01:05:47,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, who's doing the procurement for us?

745
01:05:47,149 --> 01:05:50,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, can we find out who's doing the procurement for us at the moment?

746
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:57,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we amend this paper to request the mayor's office to inform us as to who is doing the procurement work at this point?

747
01:05:57,825 --> 01:06:07,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it could get fast-tracked so this could go to the beginning of the list so we can get this started before the summer.

748
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,730
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can probably do it by the end of November.

749
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:10,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Councilor.

750
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:14,891
[SPEAKER_09]: And my last question is, when is the interim going to be taken away from your job?

751
01:06:15,892 --> 01:06:17,332
[SPEAKER_09]: That is up to the mayor, sir.

752
01:06:17,852 --> 01:06:19,193
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. President, if we could also ask

753
01:06:20,084 --> 01:06:23,827
[SPEAKER_09]: when Mr. Keran's interim status will be changed.

754
01:06:25,888 --> 01:06:34,815
[SPEAKER_15]: And further amended that a request be made of the mayor's office as to the terminal point of Mr. Keran's.

755
01:06:34,855 --> 01:06:37,977
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought he was, I think his original was like 45 days or 90 days.

756
01:06:38,137 --> 01:06:44,141
[SPEAKER_15]: The terminal point of Mr. Keran's tenure as interim commissioner of public works.

757
01:06:44,161 --> 01:06:47,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Keran's 90 days is long but up and he's doing a fine job.

758
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:48,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, councillor.

759
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:49,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, councillor.

760
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:50,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

761
01:06:50,535 --> 01:06:51,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

762
01:06:51,756 --> 01:06:53,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Carranza, just a couple of quick questions.

763
01:06:53,517 --> 01:06:59,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the only option, if you have a stump, is the only option to replace the stump with a sidewalk?

764
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:01,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you get a tree if you want, or is that?

765
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:17,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, but what we would do, I mean, a lot of the stumps that are there now are actually, not only have pulled the asphalt or the concrete up, but they've also disturbed the curbing, and also even buckled the roadway, because a lot of these trees were very, very old.

766
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:25,289
[SPEAKER_17]: and deep rooted, so we really have to reinvent the wheel and replace the sidewalk.

767
01:07:25,729 --> 01:07:26,650
[SPEAKER_17]: We box it out.

768
01:07:28,893 --> 01:07:35,942
[SPEAKER_17]: But once we have it boxed out, then our arborists will consult with the homeowner, give them the choice of tree.

769
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,147
[SPEAKER_17]: and it would be a fall planting, you know, it wouldn't happen right away.

770
01:07:39,207 --> 01:07:40,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So people do have an option, right?

771
01:07:40,487 --> 01:07:40,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

772
01:07:40,968 --> 01:07:41,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

773
01:07:41,828 --> 01:07:47,471
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as, so the operatives, is that that person who auditioned, so Zaki?

774
01:07:47,652 --> 01:07:47,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

775
01:07:48,052 --> 01:07:53,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So Zaki actually, she's the one who actually contacts the homeowners and says, you know, what do you prefer?

776
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:53,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

777
01:07:53,515 --> 01:07:58,898
[SPEAKER_17]: She gives them, I think, the choice of what is available, you know, for the fall planting.

778
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,441
[SPEAKER_17]: And they have an option at that point, whether to say, yes, I want it,

779
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:04,401
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I do.

780
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:06,302
[SPEAKER_17]: I no longer want a tree in front of my house.

781
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:07,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

782
01:08:07,182 --> 01:08:16,824
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as if someone is, how does someone go about determining, say if they're new to the neighbourhood, how do they know if they're on the list or not?

783
01:08:17,064 --> 01:08:19,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they contact your office?

784
01:08:19,165 --> 01:08:22,005
[SPEAKER_17]: They can contact DPW in various ways.

785
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:29,587
[SPEAKER_17]: The C-Click Fix Program, email, in person, or the old-fashioned way, telephone.

786
01:08:30,685 --> 01:08:34,531
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I'd be more than happy to look their name up on the list.

787
01:08:34,772 --> 01:08:35,613
[SPEAKER_17]: And that has occurred.

788
01:08:39,975 --> 01:08:44,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Can people be added to that list, or is the list what it is right now?

789
01:08:44,536 --> 01:08:48,397
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that'll continue to grow, you know, as of tomorrow.

790
01:08:48,637 --> 01:08:48,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

791
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:54,518
[SPEAKER_17]: But that actual number that I gave you was what it was by four o'clock this afternoon.

792
01:08:54,598 --> 01:09:01,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so if someone calls me, I can say, you know, call DW Supervix, and you can be added to the list, yes.

793
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:03,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

794
01:09:03,281 --> 01:09:11,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Would it be possible to provide us with a report once this is complete to actually see how many trees and stumps were actually replaced?

795
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:14,951
[SPEAKER_08]: How many stumps were grinded and how many sidewalks were replaced?

796
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:26,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to find out, I guess, you know, just in case it gets to a point where, you know, we don't have everything done, at least to know how much got done, what's moving in the government.

797
01:09:26,441 --> 01:09:26,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

798
01:09:26,921 --> 01:09:29,123
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd be happy to provide you with a progress report.

799
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:31,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

800
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:36,081
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to notify Councilor Falco that a progress report be given to the City Council before the holiday season.

801
01:09:37,262 --> 01:09:39,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

802
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:41,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

803
01:09:41,244 --> 01:09:43,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And through you to Mr. Kerins, thank you very much for your work.

804
01:09:44,225 --> 01:09:48,947
[SPEAKER_10]: In the short time that you've been here, Mr. Kerins, I've really appreciated the work that you've done.

805
01:09:48,967 --> 01:09:55,010
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, too, cannot wait for the day they take the interim tag away, because I truly do think you're an asset here to the city of Medford.

806
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:58,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish we could have kept you from your first day here all the way through.

807
01:09:59,297 --> 01:10:04,661
[SPEAKER_10]: But with that being said, you know, there's a dire need in this community for this type of work to be done.

808
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:10,685
[SPEAKER_10]: An appropriation for half a million dollars that's going to take care of about 400 sidewalks I think is a great investment, Mr. President.

809
01:10:11,366 --> 01:10:13,067
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that I certainly support.

810
01:10:13,648 --> 01:10:17,550
[SPEAKER_10]: The one question I do have is, though, once the contract is signed, we have an RFP out,

811
01:10:19,691 --> 01:10:23,654
[SPEAKER_10]: to nuts how long do you think it would take in terms of construction season.

812
01:10:23,674 --> 01:10:25,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Would it be one full construction season to make it through?

813
01:10:26,897 --> 01:10:28,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Two full construction seasons to make it through?

814
01:10:28,618 --> 01:10:35,303
[SPEAKER_10]: And I understand the list is going to grow and I think that your approach is the right one because if someone went to my neighbor's house and put a brand new sidewalk panel down,

815
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:41,609
[SPEAKER_10]: and then walk past my house and mine was cracked and went to the next number on the list, I'd be on the phone with you in five minutes calling on what's going on.

816
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:45,713
[SPEAKER_10]: They just did the work right next door to my house and my sidewalk's broken too because I wasn't on the list.

817
01:10:45,753 --> 01:10:47,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't get it done even though there was a need.

818
01:10:47,094 --> 01:10:48,355
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's the great approach.

819
01:10:48,395 --> 01:10:50,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's really the work smarter, not harder.

820
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:54,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but in terms of, you know, how long it would take to, to get through 400, to get through the $500,000.

821
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:55,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, okay.

822
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:59,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, well again, two parties here.

823
01:10:59,784 --> 01:11:03,987
[SPEAKER_17]: One would depend on how, uh, how expensive, uh, uh, the, uh,

824
01:11:05,397 --> 01:11:12,399
[SPEAKER_17]: concrete and asphalt is would determine just how fast we'd be going through the money.

825
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:18,840
[SPEAKER_17]: Weather, when it comes to inclement days, rainy days, obviously they wouldn't be making a pour.

826
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,861
[SPEAKER_17]: They could do excavating in those days, box the sidewalks out and prep them.

827
01:11:24,201 --> 01:11:28,662
[SPEAKER_17]: But as far as actually finishing it after, come back once the weather clears.

828
01:11:29,467 --> 01:11:37,453
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, particularly, of course, when it comes time for concrete, come November, you are going down a slippery slope as far as temperature.

829
01:11:37,974 --> 01:11:45,880
[SPEAKER_17]: And at that point, you know, we'd have to actually begin to seriously consider ceasing operation, particularly on the concrete side.

830
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:49,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Asphalt, we could probably, you know, stretch it a little further than that.

831
01:11:50,363 --> 01:11:50,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

832
01:11:50,744 --> 01:11:55,547
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know we spoke recently about some asphalt sidewalk panels that have been replaced.

833
01:11:56,986 --> 01:12:00,769
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of the asphalt panels are being replaced as a temporary hold?

834
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:02,110
[SPEAKER_17]: That's correct.

835
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:04,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Public safety, obviously, is paramount.

836
01:12:04,971 --> 01:12:10,215
[SPEAKER_17]: And in a lot of cases, we've found that you could not wait for a contract.

837
01:12:10,235 --> 01:12:12,757
[SPEAKER_17]: An immediate measure had to be taken.

838
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:24,825
[SPEAKER_17]: And the quickest in-house remedy that we had on hand was to put asphalt, explaining to either the homeowner or the business owner that this is only a stopgap measure.

839
01:12:25,218 --> 01:12:27,320
[SPEAKER_17]: are to prevent people from, you know, tripping and falling.

840
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:28,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

841
01:12:29,061 --> 01:12:29,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

842
01:12:29,922 --> 01:12:36,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I, for one, Mr. President, look forward to this work getting done and the administration putting another paper forward to us for us to appropriate some more funds.

843
01:12:36,807 --> 01:12:46,956
[SPEAKER_10]: As Councilor Mark said, clearly, one of the largest concerns that he's heard after putting out a press release about what he feels, if you feel safe in your neighborhood, is everyone has very large concerns about pedestrian safety.

844
01:12:47,456 --> 01:12:50,719
[SPEAKER_10]: And sidewalks are for people to walk on, for pedestrians.

845
01:12:50,839 --> 01:12:54,322
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I certainly think that this is a worthwhile expenditure, Mr. President.

846
01:12:54,342 --> 01:12:54,902
[SPEAKER_10]: I move for approval.

847
01:12:55,382 --> 01:12:58,203
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion for approval as amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks.

848
01:12:58,964 --> 01:12:59,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

849
01:12:59,984 --> 01:13:02,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank the interim director for being here tonight.

850
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:11,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, speaking from experience and I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn was the only one on the council at the time.

851
01:13:11,349 --> 01:13:18,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, then, uh, uh, DPW Commissioner Jack Buckley back some many years ago,

852
01:13:19,598 --> 01:13:31,502
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, presented a very similar paper, uh, on behalf of mayor McGlynn, uh, asking for an appropriation, uh, from this council to repair a number of sidewalks and remove a number of stumps.

853
01:13:32,362 --> 01:13:43,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And that night I recall vividly, actually the Boston Globe wrote a nice story about it, uh, asking Mr. Buckley, uh, what are we going to get for the, I believe at the time it might've been a half a million dollars or maybe 750,000.

854
01:13:43,865 --> 01:13:48,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, Jack Buckley at the time said, I'll do my best.

855
01:13:49,485 --> 01:13:50,966
[SPEAKER_05]: to accomplish as many as possible.

856
01:13:51,906 --> 01:13:56,109
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time, we said we'd like to see some more facts and figures.

857
01:13:57,070 --> 01:14:11,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on what you provided me here tonight, I have a tough time believing that everyone that requested a sidewalk back in 2012 got their sidewalk replaced.

858
01:14:12,359 --> 01:14:18,302
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not, I can't find one that dates prior to like May of 2012.

859
01:14:20,428 --> 01:14:29,234
[SPEAKER_05]: 13.

860
01:14:21,869 --> 01:14:29,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a tough time believing, knowing that for many years, uh, there existed maybe 50 of these reports.

861
01:14:30,235 --> 01:14:36,479
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably know you, you were around some time back and there was never a master list in the city for whatever reason.

862
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:46,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and I'm glad I voted against the proposal back some 10 years ago because sure enough, um, uh,

863
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:54,568
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not accomplish what we intended to accomplish, and far less were done in the community.

864
01:14:55,149 --> 01:15:00,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And the administration was back before us once again asking for, I think it was another half a million dollars.

865
01:15:01,134 --> 01:15:04,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I would just ask, this is a great idea.

866
01:15:05,118 --> 01:15:13,185
[SPEAKER_05]: No one doesn't want to replace old dilapidated sidewalks and remove tree stumps that have been there for many, many years.

867
01:15:14,178 --> 01:15:20,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I could tell you my road alone, there's been tree stumps there for over five years and they're not on this list and they're still there.

868
01:15:20,843 --> 01:15:24,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have an accurate accounting of what's out in the community right now.

869
01:15:25,447 --> 01:15:34,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And um, so I can't vote for this tonight based on, I don't know the number of, you're saying 75% of this will be accomplished.

870
01:15:35,034 --> 01:15:35,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what this is.

871
01:15:36,075 --> 01:15:37,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it 800 sidewalks?

872
01:15:38,336 --> 01:15:39,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a thousand?

873
01:15:41,076 --> 01:15:49,362
[SPEAKER_17]: The actual number there that is incomplete, that have not been fixed or repeated, is 554.

874
01:15:50,603 --> 01:16:03,653
[SPEAKER_17]: That entire package that you have, out of it, there's actually 889 requests in that package, out of which, in previous contracts, 335

875
01:16:07,057 --> 01:16:12,921
[SPEAKER_17]: requests were addressed and completed, which leaves us with the five.

876
01:16:13,021 --> 01:16:13,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

877
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:14,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

878
01:16:14,682 --> 01:16:19,164
[SPEAKER_17]: 554 requests are outstanding on that package that you're holding counseling.

879
01:16:19,224 --> 01:16:19,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

880
01:16:19,965 --> 01:16:23,427
[SPEAKER_05]: And how, how come they don't date back prior to just say May of 2013?

881
01:16:23,767 --> 01:16:27,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I, I bump into people all the time.

882
01:16:27,089 --> 01:16:30,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So I requested a sidewalk 10 years ago, uh, almost daily.

883
01:16:30,872 --> 01:16:34,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and this seems to be a real recent list.

884
01:16:36,003 --> 01:16:38,104
[SPEAKER_05]: to the other park or by the wayside?

885
01:16:38,544 --> 01:16:38,824
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

886
01:16:39,565 --> 01:16:44,047
[SPEAKER_17]: That's something that I expected and I required when I first came aboard.

887
01:16:44,988 --> 01:16:51,231
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted a detailed record kept from the day of my appointment until now.

888
01:16:51,651 --> 01:17:00,195
[SPEAKER_17]: But in addition to that, what was outstanding from the previous commission is it was still retained within the computer.

889
01:17:00,775 --> 01:17:02,656
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wanted that taken out.

890
01:17:04,381 --> 01:17:04,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

891
01:17:04,741 --> 01:17:06,082
[SPEAKER_17]: And also incorporated.

892
01:17:06,362 --> 01:17:08,103
[SPEAKER_17]: So that way it can be verified.

893
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:08,724
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

894
01:17:08,804 --> 01:17:13,126
[SPEAKER_17]: Whether or not it had been completed or, you know, or was still outstanding.

895
01:17:14,747 --> 01:17:22,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, in previous years, the work took place, uh, because it was cost effective, uh, from neighborhood to neighborhood.

896
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:26,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So you wouldn't jump in a street and not method, uh, then down to South method.

897
01:17:26,895 --> 01:17:29,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, is that still the process?

898
01:17:29,717 --> 01:17:31,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Will we be working in neighborhoods?

899
01:17:33,054 --> 01:17:53,851
[SPEAKER_17]: We will be working in the neighborhoods, and depending on who the contractor is and what staffing he can provide us, it would be nice to have two crews, one staying ahead of the other, one that would be opening and doing the excavation, and then a finished crew following right behind him.

900
01:17:54,352 --> 01:18:00,557
[SPEAKER_17]: But until such time as we put the bid out, I cannot guarantee that that would occur.

901
01:18:01,283 --> 01:18:02,984
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be the most expeditious way.

902
01:18:03,044 --> 01:18:04,946
[SPEAKER_17]: It would still be the same cost, right?

903
01:18:04,986 --> 01:18:13,072
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just that we would, you know, get into that list pretty fast and, you know, make decent headway rather than to have the same crew handle it twice.

904
01:18:13,092 --> 01:18:14,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

905
01:18:14,574 --> 01:18:16,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Which leads to my second concern.

906
01:18:17,075 --> 01:18:21,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know everyone has their own opinion, but I rather see the oldest ones tackled first.

907
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:28,845
[SPEAKER_05]: If I've been on the list for three, four years waiting, and then you happen to get on the street and see five others

908
01:18:29,518 --> 01:18:39,000
[SPEAKER_05]: that weren't on the list but need to be done also, I think it's a prudent way of doing it, but you possibly could not get to my sidewalk that's been on the list years before someone else.

909
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:43,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think in a sense of fairness, that's not fair.

910
01:18:43,341 --> 01:18:46,782
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would just ask that we wait a week.

911
01:18:48,202 --> 01:18:57,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see the number of sidewalks, I know you just gave us a figure, but I'd like to see the number of sidewalks that will be accomplished with, you're saying 75% of these?

912
01:18:59,575 --> 01:19:07,043
[SPEAKER_05]: and also 75% of the stumps that we're aware of are going to be accomplished?

913
01:19:07,363 --> 01:19:13,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, it would be the stump and then whatever is related to it.

914
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,672
[SPEAKER_17]: We could have, like I said, a couple of panels.

915
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:19,471
[SPEAKER_17]: that were damaged as a result of the stumps.

916
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:24,312
[SPEAKER_17]: We could even have roadway buckling from some of the deep-rooted trees.

917
01:19:24,632 --> 01:19:34,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Really, each stump situation is going to be a case-by-case, depending on how deep-rooted the tree is and how old it was.

918
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:43,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't vote on this tonight until I see

919
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:51,728
[SPEAKER_05]: just a detailed list of how many sidewalks we have now, and what will be accomplished in regards to sidewalks and stumps.

920
01:19:52,248 --> 01:19:57,270
[SPEAKER_05]: What's roughly one panel cost to have done for an outside contractor?

921
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:02,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Today's, I couldn't even begin to tell you what today's current price is, Councilor.

922
01:20:03,592 --> 01:20:04,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Ballpark estimate.

923
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:08,874
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, ballpark, all right, for excavating, boxing in.

924
01:20:08,894 --> 01:20:10,615
[SPEAKER_17]: One panel, one panel.

925
01:20:12,275 --> 01:20:21,543
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you're probably talking, you know, maybe, all right, with a contract like that, maybe, you know, say, you know, $20, $25 a panel, all right?

926
01:20:21,563 --> 01:20:21,543
$25?

927
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:23,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, possibly.

928
01:20:23,144 --> 01:20:25,626
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, you know, I don't know what today's prices are.

929
01:20:26,387 --> 01:20:34,794
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm hearing conflicting stories that prices of material have gone down, but I've also heard it's gone up in previous years, all right?

930
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:40,339
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I can gladly supply an old expired contract, which would be from last year,

931
01:20:40,746 --> 01:20:43,848
[SPEAKER_17]: that would have the breakdown, all right, you know, an itemized breakdown.

932
01:20:44,128 --> 01:20:48,452
[SPEAKER_17]: But I couldn't, you know, give an honest statement as far as what it would be today or even close to it.

933
01:20:49,472 --> 01:20:57,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So the ripping up, the foundation that you have to, the boxing in, and then the pouring of the cement is $25 a month.

934
01:20:57,638 --> 01:21:00,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be somewhere close to it.

935
01:21:01,281 --> 01:21:08,526
[SPEAKER_17]: Because again, you're talking, all right, you know, at least three, you're talking at least three inches of concrete, you know, two and a half to three inches of,

936
01:21:09,116 --> 01:21:10,457
[SPEAKER_17]: concrete per slab.

937
01:21:11,778 --> 01:21:22,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Then if it involves a driveway apron, now you're talking four inches of concrete for a driveway apron because of the weight of an automobile or a pickup truck.

938
01:21:22,027 --> 01:21:22,607
[SPEAKER_05]: You said $25, right?

939
01:21:22,647 --> 01:21:22,747
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

940
01:21:22,787 --> 01:21:23,268
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

941
01:21:23,288 --> 01:21:23,268
$25.

942
01:21:23,348 --> 01:21:24,028
[SPEAKER_17]: No, not $2,500 a panel.

943
01:21:24,269 --> 01:21:24,409
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

944
01:21:24,889 --> 01:21:25,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

945
01:21:25,049 --> 01:21:25,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

946
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:35,461
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

947
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:37,122
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it cost labor?

948
01:21:37,302 --> 01:21:40,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And what does it cost to install one panel?

949
01:21:40,865 --> 01:21:42,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're, we're, we're paying everything.

950
01:21:42,485 --> 01:21:43,766
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not just paying for the material.

951
01:21:43,926 --> 01:21:44,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

952
01:21:44,707 --> 01:21:46,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I counsel, I give you a figure.

953
01:21:46,588 --> 01:21:47,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

954
01:21:47,088 --> 01:21:47,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe, all right.

955
01:21:47,588 --> 01:21:48,329
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, $40.

956
01:21:48,489 --> 01:21:49,109
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

957
01:21:49,129 --> 01:21:53,432
[SPEAKER_17]: That's everything from the backhoe till the cement truck pulling away.

958
01:21:53,512 --> 01:21:57,294
[SPEAKER_17]: But you know, till I get to today's current price, I just wanted a ballpark.

959
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:00,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to, you know, Mr. President,

960
01:22:02,343 --> 01:22:04,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

961
01:22:04,225 --> 01:22:10,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I could, um, you know, the floor council, I, I, this is a worthy project without a doubt.

962
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:14,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I still would like to see, uh, and looking at this, there's a lot to take in.

963
01:22:14,473 --> 01:22:16,675
[SPEAKER_05]: We just received this tonight.

964
01:22:16,695 --> 01:22:26,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I can just tell you, uh, residents on Hamlin have and a Sherman court and Sherman place, uh, recently called me.

965
01:22:26,422 --> 01:22:30,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I went down to the neighborhood, uh, as we probably all aware, they dug up gas lines.

966
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:31,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was last,

967
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:32,787
[SPEAKER_05]: November.

968
01:22:33,728 --> 01:22:35,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just recently paved.

969
01:22:36,569 --> 01:22:51,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask any one of my colleagues to take a ride out to those streets and look at a street that's half paved in literally an inch from where they paved four or five inch potholes.

970
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:56,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a disgrace, Mr. President.

971
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:58,040
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is a disgrace.

972
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:01,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't I'm not blaming you in particular, but I don't know how

973
01:23:02,212 --> 01:23:15,300
[SPEAKER_05]: the city would actually see this happening and approve this, Mr. President, allowing a half a street to be paved and the other half to exist littered with potholes.

974
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,701
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't make any sense.

975
01:23:19,182 --> 01:23:24,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe if you could take that back to the administration, I think you know the streets I'm talking about.

976
01:23:24,484 --> 01:23:27,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Hamlin, Sherman Court, Sherman Place, Spring.

977
01:23:28,405 --> 01:23:29,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you been out there?

978
01:23:29,426 --> 01:23:30,346
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, not recently.

979
01:23:30,406 --> 01:23:34,308
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was like three or four weeks ago was the last time I was in that general.

980
01:23:34,328 --> 01:23:34,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Do me a favor.

981
01:23:35,128 --> 01:23:36,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Just take a ride by.

982
01:23:36,028 --> 01:23:36,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly.

983
01:23:36,989 --> 01:23:37,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And take a look at it.

984
01:23:37,909 --> 01:23:47,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's embarrassing to have to tell neighbors that the trucks aren't coming back to repave the other half.

985
01:23:48,033 --> 01:23:50,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it just doesn't make any sense.

986
01:23:51,314 --> 01:23:53,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And the lack of oversight is astounding.

987
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:56,673
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my comments, Mr. President.

988
01:23:57,953 --> 01:24:04,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask that we postpone this for a week, and maybe we can get just a one-page document outlining what's going to be done.

989
01:24:04,955 --> 01:24:10,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's prudent and fiscally responsible, and to make sure that we get what we pay for.

990
01:24:10,377 --> 01:24:12,457
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a motion for approval on the floor.

991
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:14,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

992
01:24:15,398 --> 01:24:16,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

993
01:24:16,578 --> 01:24:17,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Carnes, for all your hard work.

994
01:24:20,298 --> 01:24:33,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Part of the study that you looked into, one of the big issues I've been getting from phone calls from different constituents would be the work done by our utilities to go along with Council Marks.

995
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:47,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Have we looked at the repairs in correlation to what the utilities might have had a negative influence in these sidewalks?

996
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:48,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Have we done that?

997
01:24:51,511 --> 01:24:54,054
[SPEAKER_17]: They have been doing it in the past, as I've been told.

998
01:24:55,415 --> 01:25:02,681
[SPEAKER_17]: But I have also tried to step up the effort with the engineering division, though they are understaffed.

999
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:10,108
[SPEAKER_17]: But in addition to that, public works as a whole, I have one thing in common, their eyes and ears.

1000
01:25:10,961 --> 01:25:14,142
[SPEAKER_17]: I, we, you know, people are, they can go out and check.

1001
01:25:14,562 --> 01:25:17,644
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, I've had, you know, that happen as well.

1002
01:25:18,304 --> 01:25:29,128
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, these utility companies, obviously, of course, you know, some of them are very good at what they do and try to return the road to, you know, the same shape, if not better.

1003
01:25:29,488 --> 01:25:38,152
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there are others out there that, you know, there are subcontractors that, you know, do their excavating and repaving, like Councilor Marks was alluding to.

1004
01:25:38,956 --> 01:25:44,381
[SPEAKER_17]: that again, there are issues and we're trying to tackle that with the staff that we have.

1005
01:25:44,761 --> 01:25:47,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so the tracking hasn't been done yet.

1006
01:25:47,623 --> 01:26:06,918
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you're new to the position and everything, but we don't have an actual tracking system in place that out of these 800 somewhat sidewalks that need to be repaired, that how many were ripped up at a time that were part of maybe the utilities errors or utilities non-professionalism in the sense that

1007
01:26:07,314 --> 01:26:08,575
[SPEAKER_16]: the reason why this is happening.

1008
01:26:08,635 --> 01:26:21,405
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we can, as we move forward, I think that's something that's very important and making sure that something that we talked about, even with the Craddock bridge and making sure that when those jobs are done, we have a point person.

1009
01:26:21,845 --> 01:26:34,475
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I know you're only one person and we don't have a very big DPW crew right now and making sure that the jobs that are complete are complete to our specifications and are

1010
01:26:35,043 --> 01:26:37,244
[SPEAKER_16]: left the way we wanted them to be left.

1011
01:26:37,304 --> 01:26:38,925
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that's important.

1012
01:26:39,225 --> 01:26:41,646
[SPEAKER_16]: The other piece is I did get a phone call.

1013
01:26:42,286 --> 01:26:49,829
[SPEAKER_16]: We talked to a few neighbors and constituents that road work that was done within probably the last 10, 15 years.

1014
01:26:50,529 --> 01:26:58,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, we have an issue being, being, uh, you know, proactive with this as we move forward.

1015
01:26:59,033 --> 01:27:04,155
[SPEAKER_16]: The talking to the city's arborists and making sure that we're not using

1016
01:27:04,608 --> 01:27:08,269
[SPEAKER_16]: the trees that, the rooting trees that bring up the sidewalks.

1017
01:27:08,689 --> 01:27:27,414
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one of the issues that I've been, I've been getting phone calls that we have relatively new streets of sidewalks, but because the trees are now growing into adult trees and now taking up sidewalks that you can see now that an inch, but you know, within the next five or 10 years, these are going to be the next issues we have.

1018
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:28,394
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um,

1019
01:27:29,523 --> 01:27:46,128
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if there's any correlation that we can find that out moving forward, but I think it's something that's important that we could maybe ask the city's arborist moving forward with the sidewalks, looking into making sure that we are planting trees that are not the rooting system, trees that

1020
01:27:46,975 --> 01:27:48,556
[SPEAKER_16]: that raise our sidewalks.

1021
01:27:48,636 --> 01:27:53,600
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that I think it was the maple tree that they said they weren't, we're not going to put in anymore.

1022
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:59,364
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll meet with her and discuss that with her and see what options we have available.

1023
01:27:59,564 --> 01:27:59,805
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1024
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:00,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1025
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:01,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1026
01:28:01,806 --> 01:28:04,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Counsel Scarpelli chair recognizes vice president local current.

1027
01:28:05,509 --> 01:28:05,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1028
01:28:05,869 --> 01:28:07,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm president Delaware.

1029
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:09,452
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to, um,

1030
01:28:10,555 --> 01:28:15,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with my council colleague, Councilor Marks, with regards to waiting a week and getting a detailed list.

1031
01:28:15,658 --> 01:28:30,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I just pulled the bond indebtedness, and it looks like we went up to bond a million dollars in 2012 for just sidewalks alone, and then in 2010, a million, 45,000, so that puts it in perspective.

1032
01:28:30,126 --> 01:28:37,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Two million, 45,000 approximately went to sidewalks in the last six years, and it looks like

1033
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:42,632
[SPEAKER_07]: From what we've been told, about 335 were done with that money.

1034
01:28:42,732 --> 01:28:46,634
[SPEAKER_07]: So it doesn't add up with regards to the amount we have.

1035
01:28:46,694 --> 01:28:49,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like to see a detailed list, just so we can.

1036
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:52,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor.

1037
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:57,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Schell, would you group what paper it is she's looking at there, just so that we can take a peek at that?

1038
01:28:59,000 --> 01:28:59,761
[SPEAKER_07]: The city's bonds.

1039
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:01,281
[SPEAKER_07]: We all have it.

1040
01:29:01,862 --> 01:29:03,543
[SPEAKER_10]: And does she have a date on it or anything like that?

1041
01:29:05,233 --> 01:29:06,034
[SPEAKER_07]: We get one every year.

1042
01:29:06,814 --> 01:29:07,575
[SPEAKER_10]: And what year is that from?

1043
01:29:09,897 --> 01:29:17,422
[SPEAKER_07]: This has bonds up until 2013.

1044
01:29:17,862 --> 01:29:17,422
2013.

1045
01:29:18,503 --> 01:29:22,966
[SPEAKER_10]: And the document, Mr. President, though, wouldn't be just the bonds that were issued in 2013.

1046
01:29:23,006 --> 01:29:27,329
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be 15 or 20 years worth of bonds that are being paid off over the period of time.

1047
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:27,329
2005, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012.

1048
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:28,831
[SPEAKER_07]: So it goes back to at least 2010.

1049
01:29:29,111 --> 01:29:30,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a debt service schedule?

1050
01:29:30,292 --> 01:29:30,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1051
01:29:30,712 --> 01:29:30,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1052
01:29:35,025 --> 01:29:35,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1053
01:29:36,526 --> 01:29:37,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President, you have the floor.

1054
01:29:39,748 --> 01:29:44,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just ask, I would second the question with regards to asking for a detailed list.

1055
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:52,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we have, you know, 889 requests, and I agree.

1056
01:29:52,137 --> 01:30:01,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Mr. Buckley and Mr. Geer, who have also appeared before us with regards to separate bonds, also said the same thing as you, Mr. Kearns, with regards to if

1057
01:30:02,488 --> 01:30:06,392
[SPEAKER_07]: you do one panel on one street, you're going to look at them all on that street.

1058
01:30:06,512 --> 01:30:12,698
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, potentially that 500,000 maybe won't stretch as far as we hope it would.

1059
01:30:13,058 --> 01:30:27,012
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to know what the beginning streets would be, give us the first hundred that we're going to do so that we know when people call us and they're on that list or people are posting on see, click, fix, certain sidewalks, certain stumps, you know, we have a

1060
01:30:27,543 --> 01:30:32,585
[SPEAKER_07]: reasonable explanation of why this 500 maybe didn't stretch as much as we thought it would tonight.

1061
01:30:35,386 --> 01:30:35,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1062
01:30:36,406 --> 01:30:37,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor kind of yellow.

1063
01:30:38,227 --> 01:30:38,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1064
01:30:39,007 --> 01:30:43,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Cairns, the yellows that are on here, are those the ones that have already been done?

1065
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:45,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those the ones that need to be done?

1066
01:30:46,069 --> 01:30:46,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1067
01:30:46,529 --> 01:30:48,270
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe those are the important ones.

1068
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:48,810
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1069
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:54,752
[SPEAKER_17]: And no, that's actually the way it came out of the, uh, the commuter, uh, computer and the office staff handed it to me.

1070
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:58,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I, uh, we don't know what the, we don't know what the highlighted ones mean.

1071
01:30:58,043 --> 01:31:05,329
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I, I, I, it could be any, any color to me, but I'm going to go by, you know, whoever's on there, how long they've been on there.

1072
01:31:05,489 --> 01:31:07,350
[SPEAKER_09]: No, my colleagues have asked for a detailed list.

1073
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:10,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, how much more detailed does it get than this?

1074
01:31:10,973 --> 01:31:11,253
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1075
01:31:12,194 --> 01:31:13,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Tomorrow it'll be different.

1076
01:31:13,255 --> 01:31:15,257
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure I'll get a few more calls for requests.

1077
01:31:15,277 --> 01:31:17,598
[SPEAKER_17]: So what you're saying is the $500,000 we'll take care of this package.

1078
01:31:17,618 --> 01:31:17,658
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1079
01:31:23,053 --> 01:31:23,554
[SPEAKER_17]: How much we'll do?

1080
01:31:23,634 --> 01:31:23,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1081
01:31:24,114 --> 01:31:33,420
[SPEAKER_17]: No, because again, is, is madam vice chairman even alluded to, I could have one request on one street on that piece of paper.

1082
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:39,163
[SPEAKER_17]: And when, then when we arrive, this could be five or six or seven other residents on there.

1083
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:39,824
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1084
01:31:40,464 --> 01:31:42,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and again, you know, what do you do?

1085
01:31:42,946 --> 01:31:43,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Walk away?

1086
01:31:43,726 --> 01:31:51,691
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you know, um, you know that it's, it's a, like I said, you, the slippery slope that you're on, because obviously, I mean, you want to do it and do it right.

1087
01:31:52,064 --> 01:31:55,968
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, too, you don't want to just do that one and keep jumping.

1088
01:31:56,728 --> 01:32:00,692
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to do it and put it to bed at the time.

1089
01:32:01,252 --> 01:32:05,156
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why I say the $500,000, would that complete the list?

1090
01:32:05,957 --> 01:32:07,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely not.

1091
01:32:07,938 --> 01:32:09,940
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a jumping off point.

1092
01:32:10,261 --> 01:32:16,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Because again, keeping in mind, we are working against the clock as far as time is concerned.

1093
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:24,093
[SPEAKER_17]: We only have, like, three or four months left of good weather, particularly with concrete, when we're going to have to stop.

1094
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:40,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I'd make a recommendation that while we're waiting for the list, if we could at least start the process going, because from what I understand, the procurement office right now is a little backed up to wait another week or two to get it into the pipeline.

1095
01:32:40,978 --> 01:32:42,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Could be that Jonesville, let's say.

1096
01:32:42,659 --> 01:32:45,700
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could at least get the process going,

1097
01:32:46,699 --> 01:32:49,962
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can get it out to bid while we're waiting for the combined list.

1098
01:32:50,302 --> 01:32:53,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we could find out what these yellows mean or what's done and not done.

1099
01:32:53,805 --> 01:32:54,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Most certainly.

1100
01:32:54,886 --> 01:32:55,267
[SPEAKER_17]: What was that?

1101
01:32:55,807 --> 01:32:56,148
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1102
01:32:56,508 --> 01:32:56,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1103
01:32:57,409 --> 01:33:03,675
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, Madam Citizen wishes to speak.

1104
01:33:04,676 --> 01:33:06,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1105
01:33:06,478 --> 01:33:06,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

1106
01:33:11,528 --> 01:33:15,490
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a different philosophy on this.

1107
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:16,710
[SPEAKER_22]: This should be done in-house.

1108
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:25,175
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no reason why we can't have the DPW yard do this kind of work, excavate a little square, and just put it in.

1109
01:33:25,596 --> 01:33:26,376
[SPEAKER_22]: We have control.

1110
01:33:26,396 --> 01:33:29,098
[SPEAKER_22]: Because what you're talking about, you have no accountability.

1111
01:33:29,118 --> 01:33:34,501
[SPEAKER_22]: You're going to give the contract to $500,000, and then they're going to say, well, we'll be able to do three streets.

1112
01:33:35,595 --> 01:33:38,776
[SPEAKER_22]: then they're going to say, well, we didn't have enough and we had to do two streets.

1113
01:33:39,256 --> 01:33:40,397
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's making no sense.

1114
01:33:40,497 --> 01:33:42,077
[SPEAKER_22]: This is making no sense.

1115
01:33:42,157 --> 01:33:53,382
[SPEAKER_22]: But if it's done in-house, and that requires putting aside more money in the budget for DPW, workers and material, and when you put in the money for the material, keep it in the material account.

1116
01:33:54,988 --> 01:33:57,770
[SPEAKER_22]: play with it, don't borrow from it, don't do anything with it.

1117
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:01,312
[SPEAKER_22]: Cause I know how the magic numbers seem to move around.

1118
01:34:01,952 --> 01:34:04,353
[SPEAKER_22]: So, but no, there's absolutely no reason why.

1119
01:34:04,433 --> 01:34:05,674
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you have more control over it.

1120
01:34:05,754 --> 01:34:07,275
[SPEAKER_22]: And also a couple more questions.

1121
01:34:07,935 --> 01:34:08,076
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1122
01:34:08,116 --> 01:34:08,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information.

1123
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:09,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviellola.

1124
01:34:10,377 --> 01:34:10,557
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1125
01:34:11,377 --> 01:34:14,679
[SPEAKER_09]: If we had the manpower to do this in house, this whole room would be a static.

1126
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:15,640
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree with you.

1127
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:21,143
[SPEAKER_09]: So obviously, you know, I mean, uh, we're, these guys are working almost on a skeleton group.

1128
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:24,545
[SPEAKER_09]: They even, and the last time we tried this doing it in house,

1129
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:25,891
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw what it got us.

1130
01:34:26,551 --> 01:34:27,792
[SPEAKER_22]: It requires more people.

1131
01:34:27,812 --> 01:34:31,155
[SPEAKER_09]: But we, we don't, unfortunately we don't have the people.

1132
01:34:31,415 --> 01:34:35,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure Mr. Cairns would love to have enough crew to do this in house.

1133
01:34:35,218 --> 01:34:38,040
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a, that's a, that's a great big wish list.

1134
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:39,922
[SPEAKER_09]: It isn't going to happen this year.

1135
01:34:40,202 --> 01:34:40,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you counsel.

1136
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:42,184
[SPEAKER_22]: With all due respect.

1137
01:34:42,244 --> 01:34:46,027
[SPEAKER_22]: And I agree with you 100%, but it has to become a priority for the city.

1138
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:49,289
[SPEAKER_22]: This is absolutely a priority for the city to do the streets, right?

1139
01:34:49,669 --> 01:34:52,752
[SPEAKER_22]: And, and the piecemeal approach is ineffective.

1140
01:34:52,832 --> 01:34:54,193
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just want to make a couple more.

1141
01:34:54,661 --> 01:34:59,124
[SPEAKER_22]: points, which is the squeaky wheel gets the grease here.

1142
01:34:59,545 --> 01:35:03,808
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm a quiet neighbor or I'm a tenant and I don't open my mouth because I'm a tenant.

1143
01:35:04,248 --> 01:35:06,370
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a two family, three family house and we're all tenants.

1144
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:08,271
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to keep our mouth shut because we're just paying rent.

1145
01:35:08,311 --> 01:35:08,772
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't care.

1146
01:35:09,652 --> 01:35:10,053
[SPEAKER_22]: We get it.

1147
01:35:10,093 --> 01:35:11,374
[SPEAKER_22]: We get a crack in our sidewalk.

1148
01:35:11,394 --> 01:35:14,616
[SPEAKER_22]: We're not going to say anything or I'm a quiet person.

1149
01:35:15,414 --> 01:35:19,356
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to make a noise, so I don't complain about my crack.

1150
01:35:19,416 --> 01:35:22,517
[SPEAKER_22]: So my crack doesn't get fixed, but somebody else does.

1151
01:35:23,018 --> 01:35:24,538
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just an unfair system.

1152
01:35:24,578 --> 01:35:25,759
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, it's not prudent.

1153
01:35:25,819 --> 01:35:27,640
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

1154
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:32,142
[SPEAKER_22]: I see both sides of this, that if you're going to work on a street, that you do the whole street.

1155
01:35:32,282 --> 01:35:41,446
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm saying that you need a systematic approach, somebody inspecting each street, going around saying, yep, that one needs fixing, A street, B street, C street.

1156
01:35:41,847 --> 01:35:43,087
[SPEAKER_22]: And it needs to be a priority.

1157
01:35:43,347 --> 01:35:44,768
[SPEAKER_22]: And I totally agree, Mr. Caraviello.

1158
01:35:45,556 --> 01:35:48,778
[SPEAKER_22]: It may be a pripe dream, but all dreams start someplace.

1159
01:35:49,558 --> 01:35:53,941
[SPEAKER_15]: And I truly believe that the DPW- Point of information, Councilor Scott Peller.

1160
01:35:54,001 --> 01:35:54,501
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1161
01:35:55,181 --> 01:35:58,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the list, maybe I'm wrong.

1162
01:35:58,483 --> 01:35:59,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that a priority?

1163
01:36:00,044 --> 01:36:12,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it, these are lists that I think Mr. Karen said that you were going to a priority in how long the years the list has been out there or the request has been out there.

1164
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:30,151
[SPEAKER_17]: If the particular list that's been going around here, our Councilor, is a list that's generated by either the C-Click fixed program, emails, telephone calls, or in-person people that are requesting that this sidewalk be repaired or replaced.

1165
01:36:30,751 --> 01:36:41,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so have we, I'm sorry, Gene, I apologize, so it's not something that someone's been waiting for for a little bit longer than others, or something that might be more damaging

1166
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,962
[SPEAKER_16]: more safety-wise needs to be repaired.

1167
01:36:44,002 --> 01:36:46,184
[SPEAKER_16]: That hasn't been classified, I thought that was.

1168
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:52,410
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as the date that we received the request, that's on the report.

1169
01:36:52,970 --> 01:37:01,678
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as the actual condition, some of them have been looked at, and again, a temporary asphalt measure may have been put in place.

1170
01:37:02,152 --> 01:37:12,756
[SPEAKER_17]: because of either, you know, serious undermining or serious street trip, but also a lot of them on that list have not been actually looked at, you know, at this point in time.

1171
01:37:12,776 --> 01:37:13,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1172
01:37:13,457 --> 01:37:13,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1173
01:37:14,077 --> 01:37:14,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

1174
01:37:14,337 --> 01:37:15,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ms.

1175
01:37:15,378 --> 01:37:15,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Martin.

1176
01:37:15,898 --> 01:37:16,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1177
01:37:16,238 --> 01:37:16,998
[SPEAKER_15]: May continue.

1178
01:37:17,318 --> 01:37:17,919
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

1179
01:37:18,419 --> 01:37:26,002
[SPEAKER_22]: So what I'm saying is if we have to hire four more people just to do sidewalks and whether it's asphalt or cement, hire four people.

1180
01:37:26,381 --> 01:37:29,023
[SPEAKER_22]: and hold them accountable under their contract that this is what they do.

1181
01:37:29,783 --> 01:37:36,448
[SPEAKER_22]: And that way you have accountability, they give you the list, they tell you what they're doing, and if they don't do what they're doing, you let them go.

1182
01:37:36,828 --> 01:37:38,489
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you have more accountability.

1183
01:37:38,529 --> 01:37:45,433
[SPEAKER_22]: The story, I mean, not the story, what you're doing is nuts because it just has no rhyme or reason, no offense.

1184
01:37:45,874 --> 01:37:47,515
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand why you're doing it, I get that.

1185
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:51,758
[SPEAKER_22]: I get that it's a fix, it's immediate, and it works for right now, hopefully.

1186
01:37:52,298 --> 01:37:55,300
[SPEAKER_22]: But in the long term, it's really, and you have no accountability.

1187
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,383
[SPEAKER_22]: You really don't, because it's just, look at what happens.

1188
01:38:00,243 --> 01:38:05,527
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, some streets get done, there's no systematic approach to it, and it needs to have a systematic approach.

1189
01:38:05,987 --> 01:38:15,353
[SPEAKER_22]: So it has to become a priority, and if it includes hiring four guys, plus cement and material, and I mean keep it in the cement and material folder.

1190
01:38:15,874 --> 01:38:18,336
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't take that money and use it for a park or something else.

1191
01:38:18,856 --> 01:38:21,117
[SPEAKER_22]: That's dedicated money for street repair.

1192
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:21,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1193
01:38:22,138 --> 01:38:22,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1194
01:38:22,578 --> 01:38:24,840
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight,

1195
01:38:25,267 --> 01:38:27,148
[SPEAKER_15]: seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1196
01:38:27,628 --> 01:38:28,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Sir, welcome.

1197
01:38:28,849 --> 01:38:31,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1198
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:32,471
[SPEAKER_18]: 24 Hamlin Ave, Medford.

1199
01:38:33,271 --> 01:38:34,832
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm aware you know me after last week.

1200
01:38:35,973 --> 01:38:41,376
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I was in bed watching TV and the only reason why I come down here, I didn't know they were going to be talking about the streets or whatever.

1201
01:38:41,656 --> 01:38:42,677
[SPEAKER_18]: I live on Hamlin Ave.

1202
01:38:43,557 --> 01:38:45,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, there's four streets that's been done.

1203
01:38:45,718 --> 01:38:47,639
[SPEAKER_18]: I know keys being whoever does the street.

1204
01:38:47,659 --> 01:38:49,000
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys probably don't have nothing to do with it.

1205
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:49,620
[SPEAKER_18]: They dug it up.

1206
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:50,881
[SPEAKER_18]: They had to replace the pipes.

1207
01:38:50,941 --> 01:38:52,682
[SPEAKER_18]: We understand they put it down.

1208
01:38:53,422 --> 01:38:54,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Like Mr. Mark said,

1209
01:38:55,079 --> 01:38:57,661
[SPEAKER_18]: I need you guys to go down there and go look at it.

1210
01:38:57,861 --> 01:38:58,842
[SPEAKER_18]: The old street looked better.

1211
01:38:59,743 --> 01:39:00,463
[SPEAKER_18]: Listen, they tried.

1212
01:39:00,503 --> 01:39:01,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody's saying they didn't try.

1213
01:39:02,685 --> 01:39:04,227
[SPEAKER_18]: They put two inches of tar down.

1214
01:39:05,187 --> 01:39:05,528
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay?

1215
01:39:06,308 --> 01:39:07,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody knows three to four inches.

1216
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:08,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody knows that.

1217
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:10,952
[SPEAKER_18]: We got a house across the street they're doing over.

1218
01:39:11,012 --> 01:39:12,253
[SPEAKER_18]: They got the permits being built.

1219
01:39:12,633 --> 01:39:13,334
[SPEAKER_18]: Trucks are turning around.

1220
01:39:13,394 --> 01:39:14,435
[SPEAKER_18]: It's already been tearing up.

1221
01:39:14,955 --> 01:39:16,156
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a seam going down the middle.

1222
01:39:16,196 --> 01:39:18,738
[SPEAKER_18]: If you looked like it, if you ever saw it, you got to go down and look at it.

1223
01:39:19,419 --> 01:39:19,919
[SPEAKER_18]: You come down.

1224
01:39:19,959 --> 01:39:20,780
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't there, I guess.

1225
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:21,721
[SPEAKER_18]: You were around.

1226
01:39:22,562 --> 01:39:24,243
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like the ghetto, the old street looked better.

1227
01:39:24,563 --> 01:39:27,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Half the street's done, half the street.

1228
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:31,408
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just like, so people have come to me, they think I'm a movie star.

1229
01:39:31,648 --> 01:39:35,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Everywhere I go, people are shaking my hand after last week about the parking ticket.

1230
01:39:35,871 --> 01:39:39,954
[SPEAKER_18]: It was on the news, it was on the radio, the parking ticket, that's done deal, whatever.

1231
01:39:40,355 --> 01:39:42,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Everywhere I go, people are thanking me.

1232
01:39:42,276 --> 01:39:44,498
[SPEAKER_18]: My phone hasn't stopped, my doorbell hasn't stopped.

1233
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:48,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that my neighbors are coming to me, I told them, stop, come bring in my bell, last night at 10 o'clock.

1234
01:39:48,601 --> 01:39:49,661
[SPEAKER_18]: They won't, I signed a petition.

1235
01:39:49,681 --> 01:39:52,023
[SPEAKER_18]: We got like 150 people, all every side street.

1236
01:39:52,347 --> 01:39:54,249
[SPEAKER_18]: So a couple people can't, they work for the city.

1237
01:39:54,269 --> 01:39:57,491
[SPEAKER_18]: A couple other people said, yeah, okay, I don't wanna get involved.

1238
01:39:57,952 --> 01:39:59,233
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fine, that's their option.

1239
01:39:59,893 --> 01:40:05,558
[SPEAKER_18]: But to see it, I just don't understand if you're doing a street, I know money's tough.

1240
01:40:06,338 --> 01:40:08,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I pay $7,000 in taxes.

1241
01:40:09,021 --> 01:40:11,903
[SPEAKER_18]: They sweep the street twice a year, not getting off the subject.

1242
01:40:12,484 --> 01:40:16,527
[SPEAKER_18]: But you might say, hey, they're doing half the street, maybe we can put the other half.

1243
01:40:16,587 --> 01:40:19,129
[SPEAKER_18]: If they spend 20 grand, maybe we can put the other 20 grand in.

1244
01:40:19,149 --> 01:40:20,230
[SPEAKER_18]: So we save the 20 grand.

1245
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:24,395
[SPEAKER_18]: And I understand maybe they didn't communicate with you guys about it.

1246
01:40:24,675 --> 01:40:25,416
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to see it.

1247
01:40:26,376 --> 01:40:30,580
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're told through the grapevine that it's going to be done.

1248
01:40:31,321 --> 01:40:31,761
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know.

1249
01:40:33,082 --> 01:40:35,744
[SPEAKER_18]: So, but you have to go down and look at it.

1250
01:40:35,804 --> 01:40:36,825
[SPEAKER_18]: I know they try to correct it.

1251
01:40:37,626 --> 01:40:38,126
[SPEAKER_18]: It's awful.

1252
01:40:39,728 --> 01:40:42,870
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like people don't, they're coming to me.

1253
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:44,391
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, well, you want to sign a petition?

1254
01:40:44,512 --> 01:40:45,292
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll sign a petition.

1255
01:40:45,793 --> 01:40:47,374
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I think we should give them the opportunity.

1256
01:40:48,516 --> 01:40:53,477
[SPEAKER_18]: for you guys or whoever has to do it to go down and take a look at it and see what it looks like, you know?

1257
01:40:54,118 --> 01:40:54,998
[SPEAKER_18]: And then go from there.

1258
01:40:55,158 --> 01:40:58,359
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, once you start to plow with two inches, you're better off to leave the old.

1259
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:01,480
[SPEAKER_18]: And the beginning of the street, it's all potholes to the side.

1260
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:02,880
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's worse.

1261
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:06,221
[SPEAKER_18]: The little trench they had looked better than what it looks now.

1262
01:41:06,301 --> 01:41:08,341
[SPEAKER_18]: People come down, everybody's like, when are they finishing the street?

1263
01:41:08,361 --> 01:41:10,422
[SPEAKER_18]: I said, we live in Medford, what are you, crazy?

1264
01:41:11,642 --> 01:41:12,102
[SPEAKER_18]: That's done.

1265
01:41:12,543 --> 01:41:12,923
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

1266
01:41:13,763 --> 01:41:15,603
[SPEAKER_18]: It shouldn't be like that, you know?

1267
01:41:15,663 --> 01:41:16,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, you laugh, Freddy.

1268
01:41:16,884 --> 01:41:17,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Your street wouldn't be like that.

1269
01:41:18,814 --> 01:41:20,495
[SPEAKER_18]: You wouldn't, your street wouldn't be like that.

1270
01:41:20,815 --> 01:41:22,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor's street wouldn't be like that, I guarantee you.

1271
01:41:23,837 --> 01:41:27,519
[SPEAKER_18]: You go up to any of the areas up there where they live, look around, see if there's any stumps.

1272
01:41:27,899 --> 01:41:29,000
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that takes time, like him.

1273
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:30,681
[SPEAKER_18]: The cement, that's a big job.

1274
01:41:30,721 --> 01:41:32,482
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't do it for guys, you gotta hire it out.

1275
01:41:32,562 --> 01:41:33,983
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a lot of cement, a lot of work.

1276
01:41:34,023 --> 01:41:35,864
[SPEAKER_18]: I've done that work, and I understand that.

1277
01:41:36,104 --> 01:41:37,004
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there's so much money.

1278
01:41:37,304 --> 01:41:38,785
[SPEAKER_18]: There's so many sidewalks, and it happens.

1279
01:41:38,805 --> 01:41:40,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody does it on purpose, you know?

1280
01:41:41,567 --> 01:41:45,469
[SPEAKER_18]: But to go see it, you know, you should look at it.

1281
01:41:45,509 --> 01:41:46,990
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if anything can be done now,

1282
01:41:47,988 --> 01:41:57,135
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, supposedly, when they did all the pipes and they did all the sidewalks, they did do all the cement, and they just finished one gas pipe up the street that had tar.

1283
01:41:57,215 --> 01:41:57,916
[SPEAKER_18]: They did remove it.

1284
01:41:57,956 --> 01:41:58,636
[SPEAKER_18]: They took care of it.

1285
01:41:59,477 --> 01:42:01,619
[SPEAKER_18]: But we were told last year the streets were going to be done.

1286
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:03,240
[SPEAKER_18]: We were told.

1287
01:42:04,521 --> 01:42:06,783
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, whatever happened last year happened.

1288
01:42:06,803 --> 01:42:08,364
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think they were aware of it.

1289
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:10,406
[SPEAKER_18]: And here's another great example.

1290
01:42:10,566 --> 01:42:11,667
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the money was there.

1291
01:42:11,727 --> 01:42:14,489
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, Keyspan had to put some good money out, you know.

1292
01:42:15,598 --> 01:42:18,200
[SPEAKER_18]: They did Springsteen, but the side streets, you gotta see the four streets.

1293
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:22,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Sherman Place, Sherman Court, the next one down, Hamlin Ave.

1294
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:23,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Just take a ride by and look at it.

1295
01:42:23,564 --> 01:42:25,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at the daylight, but just look at already the stone all over.

1296
01:42:25,946 --> 01:42:27,427
[SPEAKER_18]: It's already coming up at the end of the driveway.

1297
01:42:27,467 --> 01:42:29,449
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just, it's gonna be worse when they plow.

1298
01:42:29,469 --> 01:42:30,029
[SPEAKER_18]: It's gonna be a mess.

1299
01:42:30,049 --> 01:42:31,170
[SPEAKER_18]: You're better off to leave it alone.

1300
01:42:31,971 --> 01:42:33,572
[SPEAKER_18]: This is only my second time here now.

1301
01:42:33,592 --> 01:42:37,575
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't wanna be here, but I don't wanna be the guy running around doing petitions and ringing my doorbell.

1302
01:42:39,477 --> 01:42:43,540
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just, so I just thank you for your time.

1303
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:45,373
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, hopefully, something can happen.

1304
01:42:45,393 --> 01:42:48,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I have a couple of councilmarks.

1305
01:42:48,935 --> 01:42:59,023
[SPEAKER_05]: On behalf of Mr. Lustig, we offer that the city engineer report back to this council regarding what, if any, plans are for the other half of those streets.

1306
01:42:59,263 --> 01:43:01,424
[SPEAKER_05]: This is clearly a failure of the engineering department.

1307
01:43:01,524 --> 01:43:03,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Hamlin, Sherman Court, Sherman Place.

1308
01:43:04,426 --> 01:43:08,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And my second point, Mr. President, if I could, I know there's a couple of motions on.

1309
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:11,251
[SPEAKER_05]: One's to table for a week until we get some more information.

1310
01:43:11,612 --> 01:43:13,633
[SPEAKER_05]: The other one is to move approval tonight

1311
01:43:14,448 --> 01:43:28,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on what we heard from Mr. Kerens, that $500,000 will pay for roughly 75% of the list, from what he's telling us, and based on that, there's a

1312
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,341
[SPEAKER_05]: free cash balance of $8,687,775.

1313
01:43:30,601 --> 01:43:43,091
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were to do 100% of this list, based on the figures Mr. Cairns has given us, we could do the whole list.

1314
01:43:43,631 --> 01:43:45,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So you won't have a concern.

1315
01:43:45,073 --> 01:43:45,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't have a concern.

1316
01:43:46,193 --> 01:43:47,234
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be no concern.

1317
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:49,196
[SPEAKER_05]: For $668,000, so another $168,000, we could complete that entire list.

1318
01:43:58,795 --> 01:44:00,356
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's going to come back to us for more money.

1319
01:44:01,397 --> 01:44:06,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, and I realize you might run into things here and there, but that should cover the entire list.

1320
01:44:07,021 --> 01:44:08,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel comfortable with that.

1321
01:44:08,943 --> 01:44:12,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there's enough money in free cash to do that, Mr. President.

1322
01:44:13,266 --> 01:44:19,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, you know, if we're all concerned about, uh, the replacement of sidewalks and so forth, I think that's a great suggestion.

1323
01:44:20,432 --> 01:44:20,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1324
01:44:20,772 --> 01:44:21,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Counsel.

1325
01:44:21,112 --> 01:44:24,135
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a motion for approval for what is before us.

1326
01:44:24,853 --> 01:44:26,814
[SPEAKER_15]: for the amount of $500,000.

1327
01:44:26,874 --> 01:44:28,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's that motion by?

1328
01:44:28,334 --> 01:44:28,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

1329
01:44:28,694 --> 01:44:31,035
[SPEAKER_15]: By Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Stucco.

1330
01:44:31,135 --> 01:44:39,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask that Councilor Knight would draw that motion for what I believe is a compromise to get all the whole list completed.

1331
01:44:40,518 --> 01:44:52,422
[SPEAKER_10]: And for the figures that I have, it doesn't seem like... Mr. President, I don't think anything's going to be precluding the administration from coming back to the council and requesting another $128,000 at another point in time.

1332
01:44:52,462 --> 01:44:53,462
[SPEAKER_10]: But if they're not willing to

1333
01:44:54,340 --> 01:45:00,285
[SPEAKER_10]: move and appropriate the money at this point in time and ask us to appropriate the money at this point in time, then we're leaving $500,000 on the table.

1334
01:45:00,305 --> 01:45:02,848
[SPEAKER_10]: $500,000 of work that needs to be done, that should be done, that has to be done.

1335
01:45:03,228 --> 01:45:06,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't feel comfortable withdrawing my motion to approve, Mr. President.

1336
01:45:06,971 --> 01:45:09,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see sidewalk work start, and I want to see it start yesterday.

1337
01:45:09,374 --> 01:45:10,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, if I could.

1338
01:45:10,455 --> 01:45:12,997
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just heard that time is of the essence.

1339
01:45:17,065 --> 01:45:21,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, if the mayor came back in three months from now and said, you know what?

1340
01:45:21,466 --> 01:45:22,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have completed that whole list.

1341
01:45:22,867 --> 01:45:25,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I need $158,000 to do it.

1342
01:45:25,308 --> 01:45:25,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

1343
01:45:26,308 --> 01:45:27,768
[SPEAKER_05]: That's next year we're going to end up doing it.

1344
01:45:27,788 --> 01:45:28,969
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to be able to do it this year.

1345
01:45:29,329 --> 01:45:31,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not complete the whole list this year?

1346
01:45:31,869 --> 01:45:33,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not do it this year?

1347
01:45:33,730 --> 01:45:34,810
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cost effective.

1348
01:45:35,851 --> 01:45:36,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I see it as a win-win.

1349
01:45:36,951 --> 01:45:43,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I think, you know, in these times, we should send a message back to the administration saying, you know what?

1350
01:45:44,275 --> 01:45:45,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it all at once.

1351
01:45:45,356 --> 01:45:46,376
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the free cash.

1352
01:45:46,936 --> 01:45:47,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not do it?

1353
01:45:47,917 --> 01:45:57,081
[SPEAKER_05]: This seems to be, at least on my opinion, there seems to be some concern that we're not going to get the amount of sidewalks paid for with the 500,000 that we're being told.

1354
01:45:57,462 --> 01:45:58,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been there, done that.

1355
01:45:58,542 --> 01:46:00,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Now everyone else can experience it on their own.

1356
01:46:01,204 --> 01:46:07,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So this, this is something that, you know, in the past that we've asked for a detailed itemized list and sure enough,

1357
01:46:08,457 --> 01:46:14,679
[SPEAKER_05]: The administration came back with a much larger request for sidewalk replacement.

1358
01:46:14,699 --> 01:46:20,001
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the council wants to move that forward, I can't support it based on that reason, Mr. President.

1359
01:46:20,221 --> 01:46:23,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see 100% done, not 75% done.

1360
01:46:23,282 --> 01:46:24,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

1361
01:46:24,403 --> 01:46:26,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Lungo-Curran, and we're going to wrap this up.

1362
01:46:27,604 --> 01:46:31,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see 100% done too, but I still don't think it's going to be $668,000.

1363
01:46:32,225 --> 01:46:37,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, Mr. Curran, if I'm understanding you correctly,

1364
01:46:37,994 --> 01:46:50,918
[SPEAKER_07]: That list, maybe we could have done 75%, but I think, since you said you're going to go in and do a whole, you know, stretch a sidewalk if need be, I'm assuming that brings that 75% number down significantly.

1365
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:58,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Although we don't know how much, so... We can't, you know, we have to read the information on costs, as you can see.

1366
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:03,762
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as point of information comes, the $500,000 is going to fix $500 worth of sidewalks that need to be fixed.

1367
01:47:04,442 --> 01:47:05,202
[SPEAKER_10]: List, no list.

1368
01:47:05,542 --> 01:47:06,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Broken sidewalk is a broken sidewalk.

1369
01:47:06,923 --> 01:47:08,263
[SPEAKER_10]: A broken sidewalk needs to be fixed.

1370
01:47:08,323 --> 01:47:11,364
[SPEAKER_10]: It's our job to provide public safety in the community.

1371
01:47:11,384 --> 01:47:12,164
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a number one job.

1372
01:47:12,544 --> 01:47:15,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Pedestrian safety, as Councilor Knox has stated before, is a priority in this community.

1373
01:47:16,085 --> 01:47:17,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Residents are talking about it daily.

1374
01:47:17,906 --> 01:47:20,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Residents of Miss Rodriguez was up there last week talking about pedestrian safety.

1375
01:47:21,787 --> 01:47:23,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Sidewalks are pilot apps, Mr. President.

1376
01:47:23,467 --> 01:47:25,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we just got to get the ball rolling.

1377
01:47:25,348 --> 01:47:26,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get some shovels in the ground.

1378
01:47:26,728 --> 01:47:27,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to work.

1379
01:47:27,568 --> 01:47:29,809
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that point of information, Councilor Knight.

1380
01:47:30,777 --> 01:47:37,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, vice president Lugo current has the chair point of information count as the floor point of information Councilor Marks.

1381
01:47:38,061 --> 01:47:39,021
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the gatekeepers.

1382
01:47:39,301 --> 01:47:43,923
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's very reasonable to ask what we're going to get for a particular dollar amount.

1383
01:47:44,444 --> 01:47:49,466
[SPEAKER_05]: If I hired someone to cut my grass and said, cut my grass for a hundred dollars and get as far as you can.

1384
01:47:49,646 --> 01:47:52,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And I come back and only half the lawns mode, I'd have a problem with it.

1385
01:47:53,128 --> 01:47:55,209
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd want to know that what's being done.

1386
01:47:55,639 --> 01:48:01,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So to say that we're going to take $500,000 and do $500,000 worth of sidewalks, what if that's three sidewalks?

1387
01:48:02,084 --> 01:48:02,644
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know.

1388
01:48:02,704 --> 01:48:05,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, I think it's prudent to have a list.

1389
01:48:05,926 --> 01:48:08,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we don't have a complete list like we have tonight.

1390
01:48:08,188 --> 01:48:12,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information is a statement of a point of information, not a continuation of endless debate.

1391
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:15,513
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad you know the rules, Mr. President.

1392
01:48:15,633 --> 01:48:16,214
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have the floor?

1393
01:48:16,854 --> 01:48:17,855
[SPEAKER_15]: You have the floor, madam.

1394
01:48:18,255 --> 01:48:19,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1395
01:48:19,456 --> 01:48:20,477
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you will, wrap it up.

1396
01:48:20,912 --> 01:48:23,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, no, 100% this is about public safety.

1397
01:48:23,733 --> 01:48:25,353
[SPEAKER_07]: We all want sidewalks done.

1398
01:48:25,413 --> 01:48:28,434
[SPEAKER_07]: But we also have to answer to our constituents.

1399
01:48:28,554 --> 01:48:30,394
[SPEAKER_07]: We see what's going on on C-Click Fix.

1400
01:48:30,434 --> 01:48:33,875
[SPEAKER_07]: We heard this 889 requests for sidewalks.

1401
01:48:33,915 --> 01:48:35,395
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not sure of the number of stumps.

1402
01:48:35,815 --> 01:48:44,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to know where the $500,000 is being spent, even if it's a list of the first 100 sidewalks, first 50 stumps that are going to be removed.

1403
01:48:44,697 --> 01:48:46,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to know that information.

1404
01:48:46,338 --> 01:48:47,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that an amendment, Madam Vice President?

1405
01:48:48,333 --> 01:48:51,174
[SPEAKER_07]: that is a request to get before we vote on this paper.

1406
01:48:51,594 --> 01:49:03,617
[SPEAKER_15]: On the amendment by Vice President Lungo-Koehn that we get a report back on the expenditure of the first 100 sidewalks and what is the balance of this expenditure?

1407
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:04,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a list, yes.

1408
01:49:04,478 --> 01:49:15,781
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we have to ask the administration to join forces with the Director of Public Works and figure out if we can do all these sidewalks for the

1409
01:49:16,349 --> 01:49:24,554
[SPEAKER_07]: a different amount of money that maybe we think of appropriating more than the $500,000 if need be, if it is somewhere around the $600,000, $700,000 range.

1410
01:49:24,654 --> 01:49:25,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I highly, highly doubt it.

1411
01:49:26,275 --> 01:49:28,916
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's get it all done if we can.

1412
01:49:29,116 --> 01:49:33,659
[SPEAKER_07]: And we obviously know we're not going to go out to bid anytime soon because we don't have a procurement officer.

1413
01:49:33,979 --> 01:49:34,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Ms.

1414
01:49:34,479 --> 01:49:36,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Hunt stated that today.

1415
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:41,163
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a few weeks before we even think of going out to bid on the dog park proposal.

1416
01:49:41,203 --> 01:49:42,664
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have time.

1417
01:49:42,764 --> 01:49:45,005
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that needs to be done

1418
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:49,532
[SPEAKER_07]: The last time we went out to bond that I'm aware of is in 2012.

1419
01:49:52,233 --> 01:49:53,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't say it was a bond.

1420
01:49:57,135 --> 01:49:57,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1421
01:49:57,976 --> 01:50:01,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure why you always have something to say, always interrupt.

1422
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:03,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Bicker?

1423
01:50:03,990 --> 01:50:05,371
[SPEAKER_07]: He puts words in my mouth.

1424
01:50:05,431 --> 01:50:07,712
[SPEAKER_07]: He changes around my resolutions every week.

1425
01:50:08,073 --> 01:50:10,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I have people calling me asking me if he has something against women.

1426
01:50:11,314 --> 01:50:12,735
[SPEAKER_15]: Enough is enough.

1427
01:50:13,095 --> 01:50:13,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Enough.

1428
01:50:16,917 --> 01:50:17,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Multiple calls.

1429
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:20,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Multiple calls.

1430
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:23,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to table.

1431
01:50:24,562 --> 01:50:26,303
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a motion for approval on the floor.

1432
01:50:26,323 --> 01:50:27,563
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to vote on that motion.

1433
01:50:27,603 --> 01:50:29,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to table is undebatable.

1434
01:50:29,805 --> 01:50:31,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to table is undebatable.

1435
01:50:31,145 --> 01:50:32,346
[SPEAKER_15]: There's already a motion on the floor.

1436
01:50:39,265 --> 01:50:43,028
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a motion to approve before such was offered.

1437
01:50:47,172 --> 01:50:49,354
[SPEAKER_15]: It does if there was no other motion on the floor.

1438
01:50:49,374 --> 01:50:56,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I challenge the chair.

1439
01:50:56,559 --> 01:50:57,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we both challenge the chair.

1440
01:51:05,615 --> 01:51:09,196
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll take a vote on the motion to table superseding.

1441
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:21,538
[SPEAKER_11]: We're voting on the challenge of the chair.

1442
01:51:21,598 --> 01:51:26,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether we are to table this,

1443
01:51:35,456 --> 01:51:39,380
[SPEAKER_15]: if the motion to table supersedes the previous motion that was on the floor.

1444
01:51:40,221 --> 01:51:45,327
[SPEAKER_14]: I understood that if a motion is on the floor, that is the actual motion that needs to be entertained.

1445
01:51:45,887 --> 01:51:55,158
[SPEAKER_14]: That a motion to table introduced antecedent to that would have precedence and would make the matter undebatable and have to be ended then.

1446
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:05,901
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the chair.

1447
01:52:05,921 --> 01:52:07,441
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to rule on it.

1448
01:52:12,084 --> 01:52:12,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight?

1449
01:52:14,665 --> 01:52:16,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Move approval of the paper, Mr. President.

1450
01:52:19,747 --> 01:52:25,710
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm in doubt the chair asked the clerk to call the roll on the matter.

1451
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:32,854
[SPEAKER_15]: And the matter is whether or not that motion to table supersedes the motion to approve.

1452
01:52:38,196 --> 01:52:39,897
[SPEAKER_15]: The previous motion that was on the floor.

1453
01:52:41,598 --> 01:52:42,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caviolo.

1454
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:45,700
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure I think that's correct.

1455
01:53:46,309 --> 01:53:56,291
[SPEAKER_15]: The clerk has advised me that the motion to table will stand and that none of the amendments will leave because the matter is tabled.

1456
01:53:57,051 --> 01:53:59,071
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion to table, all those in favor?

1457
01:54:00,631 --> 01:54:01,472
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1458
01:54:03,072 --> 01:54:05,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight and myself are in opposition.

1459
01:54:06,692 --> 01:54:12,153
[SPEAKER_15]: The matter is tabled.

1460
01:54:12,173 --> 01:54:13,974
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-488 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1461
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:15,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council

1462
01:54:16,232 --> 01:54:24,356
[SPEAKER_15]: request an update from the building department and city solicitor in regards to the property on Boynton Road that has been in probate for some time.

1463
01:54:24,816 --> 01:54:25,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello.

1464
01:54:25,957 --> 01:54:26,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1465
01:54:26,957 --> 01:54:42,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, at the time when I, uh, when I put this on the agenda, um, I was notified a couple of days later that this matter is now out of probate, uh, and, uh, the developer, the, the owner is taking bids on the property.

1466
01:54:43,144 --> 01:54:43,985
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um,

1467
01:54:45,398 --> 01:54:55,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess my resolution is a moot point now, so it is out of probate and the property is being put up for sale and bids will be accepted.

1468
01:54:57,221 --> 01:55:04,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Crowley has been looking at that property for a few years now and hopefully it's at the end of the road to getting it done.

1469
01:55:04,664 --> 01:55:05,704
[SPEAKER_09]: And I forwarded you the letter.

1470
01:55:06,507 --> 01:55:09,589
[SPEAKER_09]: from the attorney, and the attorney claims that he is taking bids.

1471
01:55:09,629 --> 01:55:14,772
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would hope that it will be the end of this and get it done very soon.

1472
01:55:14,792 --> 01:55:20,596
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand there's multiple real estate people looking at it, and I would hope it would be sold on a very timely basis.

1473
01:55:23,898 --> 01:55:24,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Mark Crowley.

1474
01:55:25,539 --> 01:55:27,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Mark Crowley, 59 Boynton Road.

1475
01:55:28,281 --> 01:55:30,602
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor Calabriel, for bringing this matter before me.

1476
01:55:30,622 --> 01:55:33,284
[SPEAKER_20]: With all due respect, hope is not a strategy.

1477
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:38,965
[SPEAKER_20]: We have had this issue before the city for three and a half years.

1478
01:55:39,386 --> 01:55:45,054
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, with all due respect, I've heard and the neighbors have heard in the neighborhood the same story.

1479
01:55:45,395 --> 01:55:49,521
[SPEAKER_09]: According to the letter that I sent you, it was out of probate somewhere around the end of April.

1480
01:55:49,857 --> 01:55:52,759
[SPEAKER_20]: I was also told about a year ago it was out of probate.

1481
01:55:53,399 --> 01:55:58,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been told by the building department that he is entertaining office on us.

1482
01:55:58,542 --> 01:56:00,904
[SPEAKER_20]: That may very well be the fact.

1483
01:56:02,184 --> 01:56:05,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know this at the time when I put this motion forward.

1484
01:56:05,126 --> 01:56:08,328
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's an encouraging development.

1485
01:56:09,509 --> 01:56:10,729
[SPEAKER_20]: However, I've heard

1486
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:21,208
[SPEAKER_20]: again, from this council and from members of the building department and the housing and the health department, um, for many, many years, similar encouraging statements.

1487
01:56:21,728 --> 01:56:26,913
[SPEAKER_20]: So, um, with all due respect, again, apologies if I don't get too excited about that prospect.

1488
01:56:27,673 --> 01:56:28,674
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand that.

1489
01:56:28,714 --> 01:56:29,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with you.

1490
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:37,722
[SPEAKER_20]: But I would like to, now that I have a few moments here, bring this issue back up to the council.

1491
01:56:38,622 --> 01:56:46,765
[SPEAKER_20]: You may remember about a year ago, in fact almost a year ago to the date, I stood before this council with a request to address this matter.

1492
01:56:47,305 --> 01:56:48,666
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, a refresher, a little bit of history.

1493
01:56:48,706 --> 01:56:54,650
[SPEAKER_20]: We are dealing with a property at 59 Boynton, excuse me, 56 Boynton Road, just at the block in the library in St.

1494
01:56:54,670 --> 01:56:55,330
[SPEAKER_20]: Joseph's Church.

1495
01:56:56,131 --> 01:57:00,654
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a home that has been vacant and abandoned for the past three and a half years.

1496
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:03,856
[SPEAKER_20]: It has been, has a big red X on the front of it.

1497
01:57:04,837 --> 01:57:14,123
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a quiet residential neighborhood and the challenge with this home, if any of you have driven by it, and I'm happy to provide photos of it, is that the building is completely overgrown.

1498
01:57:14,647 --> 01:57:16,667
[SPEAKER_20]: and is quite literally collapsing.

1499
01:57:17,228 --> 01:57:19,788
[SPEAKER_20]: If you go around back, the roof has completely caved in.

1500
01:57:20,488 --> 01:57:22,229
[SPEAKER_20]: The porches have completely caved in.

1501
01:57:22,969 --> 01:57:24,169
[SPEAKER_20]: It is infested with vermin.

1502
01:57:24,469 --> 01:57:30,010
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we frequently see rats, raccoons, snake, possum, mice, you name it.

1503
01:57:30,651 --> 01:57:34,792
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a rusting car in the backyard that has sunk deep into the ground.

1504
01:57:36,092 --> 01:57:40,953
[SPEAKER_20]: Our neighbors in the street have been very, very patient for three and a half years.

1505
01:57:41,583 --> 01:57:53,012
[SPEAKER_20]: We have brought this to the attention of the city, both the building department, the housing department, and as well as, you know, I did this back in 2014, was told it was in probate.

1506
01:57:53,072 --> 01:57:53,852
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a legal matter.

1507
01:57:53,913 --> 01:57:54,813
[SPEAKER_20]: There's nothing they could do.

1508
01:57:56,454 --> 01:57:59,317
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, in 2015, again, they said it's a legal matter.

1509
01:57:59,377 --> 01:58:00,317
[SPEAKER_20]: There's nothing they can do.

1510
01:58:01,158 --> 01:58:05,682
[SPEAKER_20]: This year, I thought I would avail myself of C-Click Fix, put it on there.

1511
01:58:06,828 --> 01:58:09,469
[SPEAKER_20]: Dozens and dozens of people voted in support of it.

1512
01:58:09,729 --> 01:58:14,311
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, it's the second most popular entry on all of the hundreds of entries on SeeClickFix.

1513
01:58:14,852 --> 01:58:19,474
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, in a public forum, the city had reiterated the fact it's a legal matter.

1514
01:58:19,574 --> 01:58:20,314
[SPEAKER_20]: There's nothing we can do.

1515
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:30,223
[SPEAKER_20]: With all due respect, I appreciate the intricacies of the legal system, but the fire department doesn't say, sorry, we can't put the fire out because the ownership and probate status of the building is in question.

1516
01:58:30,663 --> 01:58:31,503
[SPEAKER_20]: They put the fire out.

1517
01:58:31,903 --> 01:58:34,724
[SPEAKER_20]: They address the public and safety risks that are at hand.

1518
01:58:35,884 --> 01:58:40,926
[SPEAKER_20]: This council and the departments in the city are very, very aware of the matters that are here.

1519
01:58:42,226 --> 01:58:47,388
[SPEAKER_20]: City Solicitor Rumley has, in response to the city paper that was brought before this council last year,

1520
01:58:47,888 --> 01:58:58,171
[SPEAKER_20]: issued a ruling to the city, to this council, making it clear that while there are legal matters with respect to probate, it does not preclude the city from acting.

1521
01:58:58,312 --> 01:59:14,617
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, in many ways, there are many ordinances that mandate that the city act regardless, specifically citing various chapters in the state law as well as city law mandating that the city has to act, both including the elements of fining the owner,

1522
01:59:15,014 --> 01:59:17,237
[SPEAKER_20]: This thing's been vacant for over 1,000 days.

1523
01:59:17,257 --> 01:59:18,678
[SPEAKER_20]: There's been no fines.

1524
01:59:18,759 --> 01:59:22,303
[SPEAKER_20]: Imagine, even if it's $10 a day, how much money the city's losing out.

1525
01:59:22,743 --> 01:59:25,927
[SPEAKER_20]: This property actually been developed, the property taxes in the city.

1526
01:59:25,947 --> 01:59:30,092
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I mean, just financially speaking, the city's been negligent in terms of doing any of this with the property.

1527
01:59:30,613 --> 01:59:34,057
[SPEAKER_20]: But needless to say, this is an absolute public safety risk.

1528
01:59:34,545 --> 01:59:54,981
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, the state attorney general's office has said as much the same, specifically saying, and I quote, and this was a letter that was provided by the city solicitor to the city council and to the building department saying, quote, in its present condition, the property is unfit for human habitation and poses a severe, immediate, and continuing threat to the health and safety of trespassers, neighbors, and the public in general.

1529
01:59:57,283 --> 02:00:03,588
[SPEAKER_20]: These dangers, in addition to the apparent risk posed by the structural integrity and health concerns created by trash and vermin infestation

1530
02:00:03,955 --> 02:00:05,716
[SPEAKER_20]: create a risk to your neighbors and public.

1531
02:00:06,816 --> 02:00:10,377
[SPEAKER_20]: In general, the property poses a fire threat in itself and to its neighbors.

1532
02:00:10,397 --> 02:00:13,919
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know about you, but I don't want to live right across the street from this building.

1533
02:00:13,959 --> 02:00:16,159
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got two little girls that are afraid of this property.

1534
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,100
[SPEAKER_20]: It's right up the block from the school.

1535
02:00:18,619 --> 02:00:23,163
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm frankly tired of the city and its promises of saying, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

1536
02:00:23,723 --> 02:00:24,844
[SPEAKER_20]: Start finding these people.

1537
02:00:25,365 --> 02:00:27,466
[SPEAKER_20]: Start demolishing this building immediately.

1538
02:00:28,167 --> 02:00:32,711
[SPEAKER_20]: The state allows for the authority to do that, to put a lien on the property.

1539
02:00:33,211 --> 02:00:37,495
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm frankly tired of hearing from the attorneys saying, in fact, oh, yeah, we're doing something about it.

1540
02:00:37,755 --> 02:00:39,196
[SPEAKER_20]: I met this gentleman a year ago.

1541
02:00:39,797 --> 02:00:41,538
[SPEAKER_20]: And he said, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll get around to it.

1542
02:00:41,558 --> 02:00:41,918
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll do it.

1543
02:00:41,979 --> 02:00:42,339
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll do it.

1544
02:00:42,379 --> 02:00:42,739
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll do it.

1545
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:44,441
[SPEAKER_20]: And now here we are.

1546
02:00:45,612 --> 02:00:53,196
[SPEAKER_20]: After three and a half years, I'm tired of this city looking the other way over something that it is absolutely obligated to do something about.

1547
02:00:55,297 --> 02:00:56,818
[SPEAKER_20]: So please, let's start acting.

1548
02:00:57,458 --> 02:01:01,280
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's stop hiding away from the legalities of the rules and actually start doing our jobs.

1549
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:02,440
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1550
02:01:09,644 --> 02:01:10,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, good evening.

1551
02:01:10,424 --> 02:01:11,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1552
02:01:12,433 --> 02:01:13,874
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, my name is Patricia Healy.

1553
02:01:14,014 --> 02:01:16,095
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 38 Powder House Road.

1554
02:01:16,795 --> 02:01:24,179
[SPEAKER_23]: I moved into the neighborhood right around the corner, about 20 yards away from the property on 56 Boynton, 20 years ago.

1555
02:01:24,199 --> 02:01:34,784
[SPEAKER_23]: 20 years ago, the front steps were falling in to the point where the postman no longer would deliver mail there, left it on the sidewalk.

1556
02:01:34,844 --> 02:01:38,066
[SPEAKER_23]: So this has been an issue that the city has been aware of for a couple of decades.

1557
02:01:39,065 --> 02:01:41,167
[SPEAKER_23]: I would encourage all of you to take a ride by.

1558
02:01:41,727 --> 02:01:46,151
[SPEAKER_23]: If this house was in your neighborhood, you would have it taken care of right away.

1559
02:01:46,171 --> 02:01:47,292
[SPEAKER_23]: I can guarantee you.

1560
02:01:47,732 --> 02:01:48,133
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1561
02:01:49,454 --> 02:01:55,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, ma'am, I drive by on a regular basis and that is why I brought it up again because- I appreciate you doing that.

1562
02:01:55,919 --> 02:01:56,279
Thank you.

1563
02:02:07,648 --> 02:02:08,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

1564
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:10,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1565
02:02:10,601 --> 02:02:13,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel the frustration of the neighbors.

1566
02:02:14,662 --> 02:02:19,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Mr. Crowley's been before this body a number of times.

1567
02:02:20,084 --> 02:02:23,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he's spoken to everyone on the Board of Health.

1568
02:02:23,885 --> 02:02:27,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he's spoken to the city solicitor on many occasions.

1569
02:02:28,887 --> 02:02:38,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am equally as dumbfounded why the city hasn't moved forward with the wrecking ball in this particular house and then ask questions later.

1570
02:02:39,078 --> 02:02:42,719
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a clean it or lean it ordinance in this community.

1571
02:02:43,479 --> 02:02:46,740
[SPEAKER_05]: What better to use the clean it or lean it ordinance against?

1572
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:56,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And this property is far beyond clean it or lean it, but it's something that would show the city in good faith moving on, Mr. President.

1573
02:02:57,223 --> 02:03:06,945
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I found it equally as disturbing and, and I have to bring it up that, um, I too went on the C click fix and I noticed the posting.

1574
02:03:08,010 --> 02:03:22,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city of Medford is responsible for the C-Click fix and for determining what the correct department head is to forward this message to.

1575
02:03:23,294 --> 02:03:36,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And after a very lengthy and thorough description by Mr. Crowley on the property and the clear health and safety hazards and the rodents and you name it, Mr. Crowley,

1576
02:03:37,747 --> 02:03:43,911
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned it within his description in C-Click Fix, the city of Medford assigned it to Captain Clemente.

1577
02:03:45,652 --> 02:03:52,936
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess Captain Clemente is going to go out, and he's going to arrest the raccoon and the possum that are living in the house.

1578
02:03:54,237 --> 02:03:59,420
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to throw some four-legged handcuffs on them and bring them in, Mr. President.

1579
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:01,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not trying to make light of this.

1580
02:04:02,541 --> 02:04:06,824
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not the appropriate — and anyone reading the description, Mr. President,

1581
02:04:07,177 --> 02:04:09,698
[SPEAKER_05]: would know that this is not a police matter.

1582
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:21,184
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the scarlet X on the front of the house, which is there so when a awful bit of fire happens, the fire department knows not to enter this building.

1583
02:04:22,164 --> 02:04:27,867
[SPEAKER_05]: They know that this building is a clear danger, and they know not to enter it.

1584
02:04:28,427 --> 02:04:35,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So to forward this to the police department, in my opinion, is another neglect of the neighborhood

1585
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:41,356
[SPEAKER_05]: and the residents who took the time to respond to C-Click Fix to try to get an answer.

1586
02:04:41,716 --> 02:04:44,179
[SPEAKER_05]: After all, that's what C-Click Fix is there for.

1587
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:57,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there were a few residents that went back and forth with their concerns, and it ended up with John Bavuso in the building department, which I have a lot of respect for.

1588
02:04:58,329 --> 02:05:07,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And he stated that the attorney for the property was, property was cleared by land court to be sold.

1589
02:05:08,738 --> 02:05:15,023
[SPEAKER_05]: As Mr. Crowley mentioned, that's just another promise that's been going on for the past few years.

1590
02:05:15,763 --> 02:05:20,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And John Bevuso went and he closed it out.

1591
02:05:21,428 --> 02:05:26,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you close out an item on C-Click Fix, in my opinion, it means it's resolved.

1592
02:05:27,981 --> 02:05:30,202
[SPEAKER_05]: It means it's resolved, otherwise you wouldn't close it out.

1593
02:05:30,803 --> 02:05:38,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the people going back and forth asked that it be reopened.

1594
02:05:38,708 --> 02:05:40,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Said, this is really not a resolved issue.

1595
02:05:41,649 --> 02:05:44,511
[SPEAKER_05]: You may feel it's resolved, but we still have this house here.

1596
02:05:44,972 --> 02:05:46,332
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still afraid to walk by it.

1597
02:05:46,653 --> 02:05:49,114
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still afraid that, God forbid, there's gonna be a fire.

1598
02:05:49,374 --> 02:05:54,878
[SPEAKER_05]: We know there's rodents and possum and red fox and everything else living in the house.

1599
02:05:55,683 --> 02:05:58,164
[SPEAKER_05]: We know there's a concern this should not be closed.

1600
02:05:58,485 --> 02:06:03,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, whether you're the right person to handle this, maybe not, but please don't close the issue.

1601
02:06:04,168 --> 02:06:11,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so the issue was then, uh, I don't know if it was closed again or reopened and then closed.

1602
02:06:12,373 --> 02:06:22,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Needless to say, Mr. President, uh, the C click fix on this particular issue field miserably and you know, the pitches speak a thousand words.

1603
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:34,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, when you see a roof that is an open sunroof on the top, I think it shows you, Mr. President, that the house is on the verge of collapse.

1604
02:06:35,563 --> 02:06:38,043
[SPEAKER_05]: This house is on the verge of collapse.

1605
02:06:39,403 --> 02:06:41,804
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it going to take for the city to step in?

1606
02:06:43,084 --> 02:06:43,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're right.

1607
02:06:44,444 --> 02:06:48,365
[SPEAKER_05]: If this was around someone else's home, I hate to say it, it would never happen.

1608
02:06:48,725 --> 02:06:49,646
[SPEAKER_05]: The same with the street.

1609
02:06:50,186 --> 02:06:51,926
[SPEAKER_05]: It would never be half a street repaved.

1610
02:06:52,268 --> 02:06:53,729
[SPEAKER_05]: if this was on someone else's street.

1611
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:57,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the case, Mr. President, a few years back.

1612
02:06:57,533 --> 02:07:01,556
[SPEAKER_05]: There were neighbors disputing on Memorial Way, across from the mayor's house.

1613
02:07:02,557 --> 02:07:04,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And one neighbor said, you know what, I'll get back at my neighbor.

1614
02:07:05,259 --> 02:07:12,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And he put a toilet bowl on his front lawn, his own front lawn, and he put a scarecrow out there, and he made it look like Sanford and Son.

1615
02:07:12,385 --> 02:07:13,746
[SPEAKER_05]: He made it look like a garbage house.

1616
02:07:14,967 --> 02:07:16,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And no sooner, but the next morning,

1617
02:07:17,946 --> 02:07:22,867
[SPEAKER_05]: The Board of Health, police, fire, DPW, were all lined up in front of his house.

1618
02:07:24,347 --> 02:07:27,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And all that garbage was removed immediately.

1619
02:07:27,828 --> 02:07:29,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Immediately, Mr. President.

1620
02:07:30,309 --> 02:07:33,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And they probably had, he probably had no right to act on any of this.

1621
02:07:33,369 --> 02:07:35,090
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on private property.

1622
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:36,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wasn't disturbing anyone.

1623
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:41,351
[SPEAKER_05]: But it shows you what can be done, Mr. President, when something needs to be done.

1624
02:07:41,851 --> 02:07:43,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is an outright disgrace.

1625
02:07:43,591 --> 02:07:44,152
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.

1626
02:07:44,852 --> 02:07:45,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an outright disgrace.

1627
02:07:46,850 --> 02:07:50,491
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't blame your kids, Mark, for not wanting to play around or be near that home.

1628
02:07:51,971 --> 02:08:14,776
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, I think we need to get, other than just a response saying that this attorney's gonna act, as Mr. Crowley mentioned, there's general laws, I don't know the chapter, I'm sure he does, there's a chapter that cites the city would have the responsibility if they deem it a threat or a clear health concern, the ability to tear it down.

1629
02:08:16,229 --> 02:08:18,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And it won't take much, let me tell you.

1630
02:08:18,110 --> 02:08:21,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't take much to tear that home down.

1631
02:08:21,532 --> 02:08:38,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that the city solicitor report back to this council on the ability of the city, under the general laws, to tear down that house immediately, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety, public health, and the interest of the neighborhood.

1632
02:08:39,402 --> 02:08:40,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And I ask that be a roll call.

1633
02:08:41,703 --> 02:08:44,325
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1634
02:08:48,085 --> 02:08:49,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Amendment of Councilmarks.

1635
02:08:50,186 --> 02:08:51,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President.

1636
02:08:51,647 --> 02:08:51,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1637
02:08:52,088 --> 02:09:02,615
[SPEAKER_07]: President Dello Russo, Mark, Mr. Crowley, from what I understand, it's out of probate, but has the attorney said anything to the neighborhood with regards to what the next steps are?

1638
02:09:02,635 --> 02:09:09,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, of course, they're not going to be able to necessarily sell the house, but is the land going to be sold so that we can see some movement?

1639
02:09:09,279 --> 02:09:14,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously, the city of Medford needs to get involved if it isn't any time within the next month or two.

1640
02:09:15,163 --> 02:09:15,783
[SPEAKER_07]: What have you heard?

1641
02:09:15,984 --> 02:09:22,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I was going to say, uh, from my respect, I have heard nothing from the attorney since, uh, a year ago when, uh, when he came and visited.

1642
02:09:23,109 --> 02:09:29,954
[SPEAKER_20]: So, uh, the only update in terms of communication has been, frankly, what was just shared with us this evening by, uh, my Councilor, Carol Biala.

1643
02:09:30,394 --> 02:09:34,818
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's the last we've heard, or at least I've heard of, uh, anything from, uh, from the attorney.

1644
02:09:36,099 --> 02:09:42,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we had an issue back 10, 12 years ago on, on the Fellsway that the city did get involved in.

1645
02:09:42,564 --> 02:09:44,365
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not sure what, what the,

1646
02:09:44,714 --> 02:09:45,854
[SPEAKER_07]: hesitation is now.

1647
02:09:46,094 --> 02:09:56,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I really, I agree with my colleagues and I really hope that the city solicitor can give us some answers and get some things done and that we get an update from the building department to see what we can do to, to move this forward.

1648
02:09:56,437 --> 02:09:59,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's an eyesore and obviously a safety issue.

1649
02:09:59,398 --> 02:10:03,499
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, I agree with the resolution and I thank council Caraviello for bringing it forward.

1650
02:10:06,079 --> 02:10:06,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1651
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1652
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:12,401
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm looking at the file notes that I have from this matter when it came up a year ago.

1653
02:10:13,064 --> 02:10:29,536
[SPEAKER_10]: If we look at Chapter 139 of the General Laws, Section 1, it would read that the alderman or selectman in any city or town may, after written notice to the owner of a burnt or dilapidated or dangerous building or other structure, or as authorized agent to the owner of a vacant parcel of land, and after a hearing, make and record an order in judging it to be a nuisance to the neighborhood.

1654
02:10:30,557 --> 02:10:33,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think what we need to do, Mr. President, is take the steps to designate this as a nuisance property.

1655
02:10:34,039 --> 02:10:37,942
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to ask the city solicitor if he can give us the process in writing.

1656
02:10:38,553 --> 02:10:42,014
[SPEAKER_10]: and that will give us an opportunity to examine it and see if this is something we can help out with.

1657
02:10:42,854 --> 02:10:55,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, it's my understanding that the Clean It or Lean It ordinance here in the city is administered by the Board of Health, and we have a new Board of Health director, so maybe our new Board of Health director is a little bit more motivated to take on this project at this point in time where he's just been appointed.

1658
02:10:56,836 --> 02:10:59,597
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended by Councilor Knight, I'll make a motion.

1659
02:10:59,797 --> 02:11:00,557
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favour?

1660
02:11:05,602 --> 02:11:15,124
[SPEAKER_05]: We've also had a situation up the heights, Mr. President, where a private retaining wall on private property fell down on a city sidewalk.

1661
02:11:15,644 --> 02:11:22,226
[SPEAKER_05]: The city approached the owner, and the owner said, I don't have the whereabouts to fix this wall.

1662
02:11:22,546 --> 02:11:28,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the whereabouts to even remove, and it was a giant retaining wall, to even remove part of the wall.

1663
02:11:29,388 --> 02:11:30,448
[SPEAKER_05]: The city stepped in.

1664
02:11:31,357 --> 02:11:41,600
[SPEAKER_05]: and is removing the debris, they put cones there, and they're gonna end up putting a lien on the person's property in order to make it a safe area so people could pass.

1665
02:11:42,394 --> 02:11:45,116
[SPEAKER_05]: This is no different than this particular house, Mr. President.

1666
02:11:45,456 --> 02:11:53,582
[SPEAKER_05]: The city, at the very least, should step in, board up that roof, Mr. President, board the stairs up, remove that car that could have gas.

1667
02:11:53,662 --> 02:12:03,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we asked if there's gas in that tank, and we were told not because it's probably already leaked over those dry leaves underneath the tank, and it absorbed the gas by now.

1668
02:12:03,949 --> 02:12:11,154
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, the city should step in and shore up that particular piece of property and put a lien on the property.

1669
02:12:13,559 --> 02:12:14,799
[SPEAKER_09]: information, Councilor Caraviello.

1670
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:20,341
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing to show up there other than tearing it down.

1671
02:12:21,081 --> 02:12:22,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've asked to tear it down.

1672
02:12:22,702 --> 02:12:23,502
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not working.

1673
02:12:28,864 --> 02:12:30,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Councilor Marks.

1674
02:12:30,524 --> 02:12:36,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, my analogy was based on a particular piece of property that was a private wall.

1675
02:12:36,406 --> 02:12:40,627
[SPEAKER_05]: The city stepped in and act quickly and swiftly to address that issue.

1676
02:12:41,507 --> 02:12:43,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is my opinion.

1677
02:12:43,525 --> 02:12:48,449
[SPEAKER_05]: a far greater concern for the neighbors, and they've been living with it far longer, Mr. President.

1678
02:12:48,529 --> 02:12:53,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whether it's shoring up the house or ripping it down, I already asked that the wrecking ball be brought out.

1679
02:12:53,792 --> 02:13:04,160
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if that's not the case, Mr. President, then we should try to do our best to patch up the roof and do whatever we can, and not at the city's expense, and put a lien on the property, Mr. President.

1680
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:06,221
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion as amended.

1681
02:13:06,301 --> 02:13:07,282
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1682
02:13:07,502 --> 02:13:07,602
Aye.

1683
02:13:08,102 --> 02:13:08,823
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1684
02:13:08,863 --> 02:13:10,544
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion passes.

1685
02:13:10,564 --> 02:13:11,525
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-492 offered by

1686
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:23,305
[SPEAKER_15]: 16 four 89 offered by council Caraviello be resolved that the Medford city council have the T clean up the brush and debris on fossil road council Caraviello.

1687
02:13:23,605 --> 02:13:24,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1688
02:13:24,346 --> 02:13:29,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I've gotten a couple of calls from the bustle road residents and I had the opportunity to go by.

1689
02:13:29,649 --> 02:13:38,053
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you go by there, you'll see, um, there's many, many down trees, uh, brush, rubbish and leaves or anything very dense in there.

1690
02:13:38,073 --> 02:13:41,355
[SPEAKER_09]: It's right over by place of the park and it is on the T property.

1691
02:13:42,117 --> 02:13:51,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know Councilor Knight had something on a few weeks ago for the T to clean up, I think, on Circuit Road, Circuit Street.

1692
02:13:51,602 --> 02:13:55,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, this is far worse than Circuit Street.

1693
02:13:55,084 --> 02:13:56,945
[SPEAKER_09]: There's rubbish, people are just throwing rubbish in there.

1694
02:13:57,245 --> 02:13:58,946
[SPEAKER_09]: And they say downed trees, rotted trees.

1695
02:13:59,386 --> 02:14:00,506
[SPEAKER_09]: It needs to be cleaned, Mr. President.

1696
02:14:00,947 --> 02:14:02,908
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion approved by Councilor Caraviello.

1697
02:14:02,968 --> 02:14:03,688
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1698
02:14:04,108 --> 02:14:05,509
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1699
02:14:05,529 --> 02:14:08,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries, 16-492, offered by Councilor Falco.

1700
02:14:08,851 --> 02:14:11,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the Board of Health

1701
02:14:12,190 --> 02:14:15,323
[SPEAKER_15]: to check the lead levels in all buildings owned by the city of Medford.

1702
02:14:15,727 --> 02:14:16,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

1703
02:14:16,728 --> 02:14:17,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1704
02:14:18,429 --> 02:14:28,198
[SPEAKER_08]: First, I'd like to thank Councilor Locke for actually agreeing to light the issue of blood levels, bloodline, and lead it to force.

1705
02:14:28,258 --> 02:14:29,779
[SPEAKER_08]: He's talked about it in the last few meetings.

1706
02:14:29,979 --> 02:14:31,100
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very important issue.

1707
02:14:31,741 --> 02:14:43,531
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, in fact, the last meeting that we had where he talked about it, I received a number of calls the next day regarding an article in the Boston Globe on May 7th about accruing students from Harvard Business School.

1708
02:14:44,011 --> 02:14:59,735
[SPEAKER_08]: They did a number of samples taking water from public buildings, civic organizations, universities, in and around the Boston area.

1709
02:15:06,123 --> 02:15:17,589
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, a number of buildings came back with basically 15 parts per building, per billion, which is equivalent of the UK tax.

1710
02:15:17,649 --> 02:15:22,812
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of the examples that they took was right here in this apartment.

1711
02:15:23,992 --> 02:15:30,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And when that came back, it came back with a reading of 30 parts per billion, which definitely needs to get an action.

1712
02:15:31,888 --> 02:15:44,370
[SPEAKER_08]: And the article went on to mention that the city engineer is looking into the situation and working on an issue to find out why it's that hot and why it's in different parts per million.

1713
02:15:44,430 --> 02:15:52,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what we need to do is basically take a look at all of our city pools and make sure that we test them for lead and we test them for water flow.

1714
02:15:52,152 --> 02:15:55,672
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's important, I mean, lead has a number of

1715
02:15:59,555 --> 02:16:03,236
[SPEAKER_08]: dramatic negative effects, especially on our children, our youngest population.

1716
02:16:03,616 --> 02:16:10,117
[SPEAKER_08]: It causes developmental delays, behavioral problems, and a lot of other health issues.

1717
02:16:10,157 --> 02:16:11,737
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is something that we need to look at.

1718
02:16:11,757 --> 02:16:14,018
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to make sure that we check all of our city buildings.

1719
02:16:14,458 --> 02:16:25,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I did make a call to the superintendent of the schools to ask specifically about the schools, and he did tell me that he actually has reports on the school buildings, and the schools are tested on a regular basis.

1720
02:16:26,441 --> 02:16:28,964
[SPEAKER_08]: which I guess is a requirement of the MWRA.

1721
02:16:28,984 --> 02:16:31,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So, he said he does have reports of those.

1722
02:16:31,889 --> 02:16:38,739
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we could get those, if we could ask for those reports from the Superintendent of Schools, just so we could take a look at those.

1723
02:16:39,099 --> 02:16:39,861
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we can have a...

1724
02:16:42,203 --> 02:16:45,985
[SPEAKER_08]: City Engineer Erin Polley, she's looking into the issues here at Bedford City Hall.

1725
02:16:46,425 --> 02:17:04,755
[SPEAKER_08]: We could also have our other city buildings looked at, tested for lead levels, and if we could get those reports back to see where things turn out, and if we could find out how we're going to actually, how the city's going to remedy the situation here at City Hall.

1726
02:17:08,657 --> 02:17:11,219
[SPEAKER_15]: by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1727
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:12,079
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1728
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:14,921
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1729
02:17:14,981 --> 02:17:15,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Carried.

1730
02:17:15,722 --> 02:17:35,214
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-500, offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, whereas in light of recent high lead level results from City Hall's water, be it resolved that the City of Medford test the lead level in the water of all Medford public buildings, as well as the playground and school water fountains, be it further resolved that the Medford City Council be giving a copy of such results.

1731
02:17:35,514 --> 02:17:36,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President.

1732
02:17:36,895 --> 02:17:37,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1733
02:17:38,615 --> 02:17:40,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is a bit repetitive.

1734
02:17:40,357 --> 02:17:44,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco and I have pretty much the same resolution on.

1735
02:17:44,901 --> 02:17:50,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree that we need to get the results from the school department, because that's, you know, is part of my resolution.

1736
02:17:51,146 --> 02:18:00,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's very important just to reiterate that these test kits are minimal to purchase and test the city public buildings.

1737
02:18:00,295 --> 02:18:05,920
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, just to be specific, City Hall has been tested in one spot.

1738
02:18:06,385 --> 02:18:08,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should maybe retest eventually.

1739
02:18:08,866 --> 02:18:16,409
[SPEAKER_07]: The library needs to be tested, Chevalier, all our public buildings, just so that we can get a better idea.

1740
02:18:16,509 --> 02:18:20,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad that the engineer's office is on it, but it is concerning.

1741
02:18:20,211 --> 02:18:25,613
[SPEAKER_07]: It's concerning to many parents and residents in our community.

1742
02:18:26,073 --> 02:18:33,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Another issue that was brought up as a concern is with regards to residential homes and lead levels in the homes, if it does have to do with the water

1743
02:18:34,698 --> 02:18:50,741
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, are we dealing with, like Councilor Marks had, you know, explained to us with the lead piping, how, if we could get an update from the engineer's office on how we're dealing with or how we plan to deal with potential testing of homes within our community.

1744
02:18:51,061 --> 02:18:52,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's really important.

1745
02:18:52,942 --> 02:19:04,244
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could also just test some of our water fountains so that we make sure anybody in our play, any children or adults in our playgrounds that are maybe drinking fountain water, that the lead levels are

1746
02:19:04,829 --> 02:19:05,890
[SPEAKER_07]: at an appropriate level.

1747
02:19:06,631 --> 02:19:16,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that Clean Water Company is the company that went and tested a number of cities and towns, public buildings, and that is who found the results of the 30 parts per billion.

1748
02:19:17,921 --> 02:19:21,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, very concerning, and hopefully we can get all our public buildings tested.

1749
02:19:22,526 --> 02:19:28,331
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess amended further, just what specifically is the engineers department doing?

1750
02:19:29,582 --> 02:19:30,843
[SPEAKER_07]: to try to reduce those levels.

1751
02:19:30,903 --> 02:19:39,150
[SPEAKER_07]: How are they working with the MWRA or whoever it may be that needs to be worked with and advise the city on how we can reduce those levels.

1752
02:19:39,690 --> 02:19:39,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1753
02:19:41,272 --> 02:19:45,756
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn as amended, citizen wishes to speak.

1754
02:19:45,776 --> 02:19:47,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, please state your name and address for the record.

1755
02:19:47,737 --> 02:19:48,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

1756
02:19:48,498 --> 02:19:50,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street still.

1757
02:19:52,361 --> 02:19:57,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So can I just recommend that as part of it that you

1758
02:19:58,863 --> 02:20:08,687
[SPEAKER_06]: As part of the research for it that you get in touch with the Bureau of Environmental Health at the State Department of Public Health, the folks there, there's a lead program.

1759
02:20:08,727 --> 02:20:12,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure there's a website for it on the DPH website.

1760
02:20:12,889 --> 02:20:28,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would not surprise me terribly if the Mass Municipal Association and the Mass Public Health Association also had some templates for cities and towns in how to handle lead abatement and testing for lead and

1761
02:20:29,165 --> 02:20:33,647
[SPEAKER_06]: how it gets done systematically, maybe where people get, where they get funds for it, that kind of thing.

1762
02:20:34,247 --> 02:20:35,468
[SPEAKER_06]: No sense reinventing the wheel.

1763
02:20:35,528 --> 02:20:36,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of places have done it.

1764
02:20:36,708 --> 02:20:40,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I know Medford is different.

1765
02:20:40,430 --> 02:20:41,771
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just like everywhere else.

1766
02:20:41,891 --> 02:20:47,473
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they've got a way that people have gone about it and been successful, no sense not taking a look at that.

1767
02:20:48,013 --> 02:20:51,315
[SPEAKER_06]: And the state may have things that can help with it.

1768
02:21:04,262 --> 02:21:16,812
[SPEAKER_06]: But speaking as a public health professional, there isn't a safe level of lead, but kids are a lot more likely to be exposed to lead in their homes than they are through drinking water.

1769
02:21:16,912 --> 02:21:23,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that drinking water isn't an issue, but definitely when you look at the abatement programs,

1770
02:21:24,313 --> 02:21:36,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Such funding as there is, which isn't enough, tends to go to abatement in homes because that is a far larger exposure, despite the fact that kids spend a lot of time in school, there's a lot more exposure in homes.

1771
02:21:37,599 --> 02:21:37,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1772
02:21:38,319 --> 02:21:39,680
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1773
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,240
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1774
02:21:42,361 --> 02:21:43,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1775
02:21:43,521 --> 02:21:44,902
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-496 offered by Councilor Marks.

1776
02:21:44,922 --> 02:21:51,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the one hour parking signs located on Cottage Street be amended to read, accept resident permit parking.

1777
02:21:51,805 --> 02:21:52,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

1778
02:21:53,281 --> 02:21:54,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1779
02:21:54,581 --> 02:21:56,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Cottage Street has very limited parking.

1780
02:21:58,402 --> 02:22:01,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably 90 percent of the street is permit parking.

1781
02:22:02,623 --> 02:22:08,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are a few one-hour signs at the tip of the street on the high street side.

1782
02:22:09,444 --> 02:22:15,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And many of these spots are go vacant most of the day.

1783
02:22:16,365 --> 02:22:20,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And residents that live on the street would like the availability of to be able to park.

1784
02:22:21,880 --> 02:22:30,465
[SPEAKER_05]: They have requested that the one hour sign stay in effect and put with the exception of resident permit parking.

1785
02:22:30,785 --> 02:22:38,269
[SPEAKER_05]: So if someone has a resident permit parking sticker, they're also allowed to park in that spot without the one hour limit, Mr. President.

1786
02:22:38,509 --> 02:22:40,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So I ask that that be forwarded to the traffic commission.

1787
02:22:41,110 --> 02:22:43,411
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion that it be forwarded to the traffic commission.

1788
02:22:43,451 --> 02:22:44,152
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1789
02:22:44,692 --> 02:22:45,292
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1790
02:22:47,282 --> 02:22:58,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Councilor Marks, number 16497, be it resolved that the recent unfavorable report from the Legislative Executive Laws Committee regarding Medford's home rule petition for charter review be discussed.

1791
02:22:58,813 --> 02:22:59,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

1792
02:23:00,514 --> 02:23:02,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1793
02:23:02,236 --> 02:23:13,626
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was a couple of months ago when this chamber broke into a loud applause when we voted for the creation of a home rule petition

1794
02:23:14,157 --> 02:23:16,078
[SPEAKER_05]: to create charter review in the community.

1795
02:23:17,319 --> 02:23:25,523
[SPEAKER_05]: A review hasn't been done in almost 30 years of our city charter, which is the frameworks on how a city operates.

1796
02:23:26,383 --> 02:23:28,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a joyous occasion.

1797
02:23:29,265 --> 02:23:42,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hate to inform residents of this community, although the newspaper beat me to the punch, just recently our legislation that was before the House Committee on Election Laws, House Bill 4227,

1798
02:23:44,355 --> 02:23:45,615
[SPEAKER_05]: met its demise.

1799
02:23:46,475 --> 02:24:11,320
[SPEAKER_05]: It received an unfavorable report, Mr. President, and after countless hours of public hearings, countless hours of public debate, countless hours of volunteers getting thousands of signatures in support of charter review, this lonely piece of paper, half filled out, doesn't even give the title of the bill,

1800
02:24:12,485 --> 02:24:22,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It says committee election laws, reporting member Mahoney, who's the chairman, Bill 4227, and it's circled unfavorable report.

1801
02:24:23,474 --> 02:24:25,316
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is what we got as a community.

1802
02:24:26,237 --> 02:24:37,847
[SPEAKER_05]: The legislative body voted, the mayor voted to send this, and then the state legislature, in their wisdom, said, you know what?

1803
02:24:39,133 --> 02:24:41,915
[SPEAKER_05]: We know better than the legislative body in the city of Medford.

1804
02:24:42,256 --> 02:24:45,919
[SPEAKER_05]: We know better than the mayor of Medford.

1805
02:24:46,119 --> 02:24:48,101
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not good for the city.

1806
02:24:48,721 --> 02:24:51,123
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna step in and we're gonna kill the bill.

1807
02:24:51,924 --> 02:24:55,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only we're gonna kill it, Mr. President, we're gonna add a little insult to injury.

1808
02:24:56,828 --> 02:25:01,132
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not gonna even afford the residents of Medford a public hearing.

1809
02:25:02,012 --> 02:25:05,916
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not gonna allow them to come up and voice their opinion on House Bill 4227.

1810
02:25:07,777 --> 02:25:09,039
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to deny it.

1811
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:12,024
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need feedback from the city.

1812
02:25:13,246 --> 02:25:19,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I, as the chairman, Mr. Mahoney of Worcester, knows better what's

1813
02:25:21,225 --> 02:25:22,206
[SPEAKER_05]: What's for Medford?

1814
02:25:22,406 --> 02:25:25,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Knows better what the residents of Medford want, Mr. President.

1815
02:25:26,267 --> 02:25:40,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the thousands of signatures, the groundswell that was out throughout the community, the numerous articles in the paper, the public hearings, and everything else that presented for a number of months before this legislation was crafted.

1816
02:25:41,353 --> 02:25:48,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I was told by Representative Donato, who was nice enough to sponsor this, along with Senator Pat Jalen,

1817
02:25:49,553 --> 02:25:55,777
[SPEAKER_05]: The chairman of the committee, Mr. Mahoney, had some reservations on this particular legislation.

1818
02:25:56,678 --> 02:25:59,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wanted to do his due diligence, which I commend him.

1819
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:08,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was going to reach out to the community and find out why it was a 4-3 vote and not a unanimous vote.

1820
02:26:08,626 --> 02:26:09,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was one of his concerns.

1821
02:26:11,028 --> 02:26:11,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And good luck to him.

1822
02:26:12,729 --> 02:26:14,990
[SPEAKER_05]: He was concerned why it was a 4-3 vote.

1823
02:26:15,931 --> 02:26:18,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess the next time the state legislature votes on something,

1824
02:26:19,810 --> 02:26:22,891
[SPEAKER_05]: we can turn to our state delegation and say, you know what?

1825
02:26:24,191 --> 02:26:26,292
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't a unanimous vote, representative.

1826
02:26:27,112 --> 02:26:28,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I'm gonna pay that tax.

1827
02:26:29,773 --> 02:26:33,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't hear the groundswell from the people that wanna pay more taxes.

1828
02:26:33,854 --> 02:26:36,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So Rep Mahoney wanted to see what this groundswell was.

1829
02:26:37,075 --> 02:26:37,996
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't reach out to me.

1830
02:26:38,016 --> 02:26:40,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, maybe he reached out to some of the other Councilors.

1831
02:26:41,097 --> 02:26:44,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he reach out to you, Mr. Clerk, to find out what took place in the public hearings?

1832
02:26:45,278 --> 02:26:46,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was in favor, who was against?

1833
02:26:47,098 --> 02:26:48,219
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't reach out to the clerk.

1834
02:26:48,979 --> 02:26:50,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was his concern, Mr. President.

1835
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:57,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And hastily, there wasn't any committee gathering, from what I can understand.

1836
02:26:58,683 --> 02:27:03,524
[SPEAKER_05]: This was unilaterally decided to report this bill out unfavorable.

1837
02:27:04,725 --> 02:27:09,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am very disappointed in the legislative process.

1838
02:27:11,067 --> 02:27:16,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I am very disappointed in the fact that this particular bill, and I've been on the

1839
02:27:17,064 --> 02:27:21,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Council for a number of years and seen a number of Home Rule petitions come through this body.

1840
02:27:22,668 --> 02:27:25,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have yet to see one denied by the state legislature.

1841
02:27:27,110 --> 02:27:37,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically a Home Rule petition that's supported by the legislative body, signed off by the mayor, is an automatic, is an automatic in the state legislature.

1842
02:27:38,617 --> 02:27:45,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And to have this killed, Mr. President, without a public hearing, in my opinion, is a disgrace.

1843
02:27:46,668 --> 02:27:55,190
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a disgrace to that committee, and it's a disgrace to the legislative process, the people we elect to do the people's business, Mr. President.

1844
02:27:55,690 --> 02:27:57,351
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am very disappointed.

1845
02:27:58,431 --> 02:28:11,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I am glad that the committee that's out there collecting signatures, as they stated from the start, they are going to continue their efforts in gathering the number of signatures that's required to put it on the ballot.

1846
02:28:11,914 --> 02:28:15,595
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to say, I am very disappointed regarding

1847
02:28:16,474 --> 02:28:23,816
[SPEAKER_05]: this unfavorable report, and I could just tell the residents of this community that we have to band together on this.

1848
02:28:24,116 --> 02:28:25,337
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the right thing to do.

1849
02:28:25,977 --> 02:28:27,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anyone disagrees.

1850
02:28:27,497 --> 02:28:34,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the three that voted against it because they didn't like the process agreed that charter review is necessary.

1851
02:28:34,919 --> 02:28:43,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think anyone in this community doesn't think we should review a 30-year-old document that hasn't been looked at, Mr. President, on the way we govern our community.

1852
02:28:44,382 --> 02:28:45,042
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know,

1853
02:28:46,306 --> 02:28:47,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Mr. President.

1854
02:28:48,928 --> 02:28:53,592
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is an open process.

1855
02:28:53,652 --> 02:28:54,912
[SPEAKER_05]: People are allowed to come up here.

1856
02:28:55,193 --> 02:28:59,636
[SPEAKER_05]: When we have the discussion, people come up, pros and cons, and we heard some cons out there.

1857
02:28:59,976 --> 02:29:05,780
[SPEAKER_05]: But to have it die the way it did after all that time and effort that went into it is a true disgrace.

1858
02:29:06,541 --> 02:29:07,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1859
02:29:07,862 --> 02:29:08,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

1860
02:29:12,225 --> 02:29:12,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1861
02:29:12,825 --> 02:29:13,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

1862
02:29:13,426 --> 02:29:15,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1863
02:29:15,748 --> 02:29:17,389
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1864
02:29:17,429 --> 02:29:28,738
[SPEAKER_22]: You're telling me that after this council voted, after the mayor approved, after the solicitor went back and made sure the writing was correct for according to the mass general laws, that it was approved by Pat Jalen.

1865
02:29:28,818 --> 02:29:31,180
[SPEAKER_22]: It was approved by Mr. Donato, Paul Donato.

1866
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:38,985
[SPEAKER_22]: And even still, it went up the chain of command with that kind of influence, with that kind of influence after 28, 30 years.

1867
02:29:39,486 --> 02:29:40,286
[SPEAKER_22]: And then it came back.

1868
02:29:40,347 --> 02:29:40,887
[SPEAKER_22]: Now the mayor,

1869
02:29:41,300 --> 02:29:51,708
[SPEAKER_22]: has connections because we know she does because at her inauguration, and this is no disrespect to the mayor, at her inauguration she had Pat Jalen, she had Catherine Clark, she had

1870
02:29:52,432 --> 02:30:20,495
[SPEAKER_22]: uh... attorney general of the state all of these people with that this is a lot of influence you're telling me with all that influence and with mister denato's high office in the senate or that uh... this house of representatives that this thing isn't political that this thing isn't shenanigans i'd beg to differ and i'd just have to say that this there's something smelly in denmark over here because it's just doesn't doesn't doesn't but it just doesn't sound right

1871
02:30:20,955 --> 02:30:41,350
[SPEAKER_22]: with the council, the mayor, and all these people, and Jalen, who's a senator, backing it, and Donato backing it, and they went forward, and they, this is for a review, this isn't even for a change, this is just to review after 28, 30 years of absolute nothing, something is rotten in Denmark here, folks.

1872
02:30:41,731 --> 02:30:50,217
[SPEAKER_22]: So don't let that, but don't let it, you know, dissuade you, don't let it, you know, that means we gotta do more work, that's all it means, but you know what?

1873
02:30:51,172 --> 02:30:53,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Shame on them, because this is political.

1874
02:30:53,374 --> 02:30:54,074
[SPEAKER_22]: This is politics.

1875
02:30:54,194 --> 02:30:55,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody is doing a favor for somebody.

1876
02:30:56,416 --> 02:30:58,657
[SPEAKER_22]: There's something in the wind.

1877
02:30:59,138 --> 02:30:59,938
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what it is.

1878
02:31:00,078 --> 02:31:02,500
[SPEAKER_22]: It's happening behind closed doors, because that doesn't sound right.

1879
02:31:02,921 --> 02:31:04,982
[SPEAKER_22]: Just on the face of it, it does not sound right.

1880
02:31:05,422 --> 02:31:06,303
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just want to say that.

1881
02:31:06,323 --> 02:31:07,524
[SPEAKER_22]: But don't let it discourage you.

1882
02:31:07,584 --> 02:31:08,064
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the word.

1883
02:31:08,364 --> 02:31:10,666
[SPEAKER_22]: Because if there's one thing we know about me, I'm persistent.

1884
02:31:11,006 --> 02:31:12,628
[SPEAKER_22]: And so we'll be persistent on this.

1885
02:31:12,968 --> 02:31:14,089
[SPEAKER_22]: And we'll keep marching forward.

1886
02:31:14,509 --> 02:31:15,089
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know what?

1887
02:31:15,770 --> 02:31:17,211
[SPEAKER_22]: In the end, just remember.

1888
02:31:18,014 --> 02:31:22,677
[SPEAKER_22]: People got up and have died for this, this ability to speak here.

1889
02:31:23,638 --> 02:31:25,319
[SPEAKER_22]: Today, this is Memorial Day month.

1890
02:31:25,819 --> 02:31:29,942
[SPEAKER_22]: Just remember, people have died for us to have our freedom, to have our say.

1891
02:31:30,463 --> 02:31:36,046
[SPEAKER_22]: And if we have to work harder for it, then we're going to be, we're going to come out looking better than the folks upstairs.

1892
02:31:36,407 --> 02:31:37,187
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you very much.

1893
02:31:37,788 --> 02:31:38,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1894
02:31:40,509 --> 02:31:40,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1895
02:31:41,050 --> 02:31:42,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1896
02:31:42,811 --> 02:31:46,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez at 281 Park Street and

1897
02:31:47,981 --> 02:31:55,946
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I can ask through the chair, but is it possible for us to resubmit the home rule and ask that they put the question on?

1898
02:31:55,986 --> 02:32:08,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was a stumbling block for a lot of people of if we want charter review on top of electing the commission, because I know a lot of people thought that we took out the choice, and maybe if we put the choice back in, that would help us.

1899
02:32:08,614 --> 02:32:13,797
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's difficult to collect signatures because a lot of people don't know what the charter is.

1900
02:32:15,178 --> 02:32:20,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll personally be at the superintendent meeting next week with my clipboard, and if anyone wants to sign, please do.

1901
02:32:21,179 --> 02:32:26,561
[SPEAKER_00]: I urge the people that are for charter review to gather your clipboard and start going to these community events.

1902
02:32:26,621 --> 02:32:29,701
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spring, and there should be more events coming up.

1903
02:32:29,721 --> 02:32:41,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see people at the farmer's market collecting signatures and any other events that are happening in the city, because there are people that want charter review, and there are a lot of people who are, what is charter review?

1904
02:32:41,849 --> 02:32:45,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point, people need to know what it is so that it can happen.

1905
02:32:48,575 --> 02:32:49,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1906
02:32:50,156 --> 02:32:50,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

1907
02:32:50,576 --> 02:32:52,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1908
02:32:52,998 --> 02:32:54,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1909
02:32:54,099 --> 02:32:56,761
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Rob Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

1910
02:32:57,402 --> 02:33:02,326
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this to our attention tonight.

1911
02:33:02,346 --> 02:33:06,229
[SPEAKER_12]: And I couldn't agree with him more about what he said.

1912
02:33:06,369 --> 02:33:10,072
[SPEAKER_12]: But it speaks to a larger measure.

1913
02:33:11,644 --> 02:33:25,195
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, for this thing not to be appealed, that ruling to not be appealed, if it can be, by our state delegation is a question that I have.

1914
02:33:27,077 --> 02:33:29,058
[SPEAKER_12]: People are disheartened in this state.

1915
02:33:29,319 --> 02:33:36,845
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it speaks to one party being in domination of this state for decades.

1916
02:33:36,925 --> 02:33:39,367
[SPEAKER_12]: They can pretty much do whatever they want.

1917
02:33:39,907 --> 02:33:40,708
[SPEAKER_12]: A few years ago,

1918
02:33:41,715 --> 02:33:49,718
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a petition, and it passed, and it was on the ballot to lower the sales tax or keep it at the same rate.

1919
02:33:50,598 --> 02:33:58,981
[SPEAKER_12]: The state legislature said the people didn't know what they were talking about, and they went ahead and raised it anyway, even after a petition and a vote of the people.

1920
02:33:59,801 --> 02:34:02,282
[SPEAKER_12]: It's disheartening to a lot of folks in this state.

1921
02:34:02,802 --> 02:34:10,105
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why the census release in December of last year showed Massachusetts lost

1922
02:34:12,497 --> 02:34:15,760
[SPEAKER_12]: 21,805 people from July 2014 to July 2015.

1923
02:34:17,101 --> 02:34:23,046
[SPEAKER_12]: People are disheartened, and quite frankly, they're giving up, and they're voting with their feet, and they're moving out of our state.

1924
02:34:23,967 --> 02:34:38,338
[SPEAKER_12]: At a time when we have the best education, some of the best technology, other programs that we're either leading the country in, or we're only second or third, we're still seeing a net loss of people, of almost 22,000 people in one year.

1925
02:34:40,874 --> 02:34:41,794
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unprecedented.

1926
02:34:42,335 --> 02:34:42,995
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unheard of.

1927
02:34:43,876 --> 02:34:50,862
[SPEAKER_12]: I would respectfully ask this body if there's some way to reach out to Senator Jalen or State Rep.

1928
02:34:50,902 --> 02:35:02,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Paul Donato to, like Cheryl said before me, to either resubmit this home rule petition or appeal the ruling of this committee.

1929
02:35:03,313 --> 02:35:15,157
[SPEAKER_12]: To just be shut down in silence like that after 30 years of the same charter, without even so much, I mean, this wouldn't have even have changed the charter.

1930
02:35:15,357 --> 02:35:21,539
[SPEAKER_12]: It would have either to keep Plan A or make a few amendments to it, to tweak it a little bit.

1931
02:35:22,139 --> 02:35:25,200
[SPEAKER_12]: And after 30 years, that was unreasonable to ask?

1932
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:27,161
[SPEAKER_12]: We get that one little piece of paper?

1933
02:35:27,701 --> 02:35:31,022
[SPEAKER_12]: It's embarrassing.

1934
02:35:31,375 --> 02:35:33,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, it really is.

1935
02:35:33,856 --> 02:35:45,179
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like this body, I request this body to please write up a letter and send it to their committee and express not just your feelings, but as the voice of Medford.

1936
02:35:46,059 --> 02:35:49,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried to get the signatures with Dr. Stirella about four or five years ago.

1937
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:57,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Another team came in after that under former mayor candidate Antony D'Antonio.

1938
02:35:57,442 --> 02:35:59,843
[SPEAKER_12]: There's another team out there

1939
02:36:00,390 --> 02:36:06,172
[SPEAKER_12]: In all of that time, we got a lot of positive feedback, but it's hard to get these signatures.

1940
02:36:06,672 --> 02:36:10,493
[SPEAKER_12]: I was on the team that got the signatures for the tank, the gas tax.

1941
02:36:11,773 --> 02:36:14,474
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a team of about 500 people across the state.

1942
02:36:14,914 --> 02:36:18,895
[SPEAKER_12]: It took a lot of time and a lot of effort, and we squeaked it in there.

1943
02:36:19,295 --> 02:36:22,576
[SPEAKER_12]: And what's the state legislature doing now in the face of that?

1944
02:36:22,976 --> 02:36:26,918
[SPEAKER_12]: They're trying to pass a new law saying the cities can raise the gas tax if they want to.

1945
02:36:29,553 --> 02:36:31,653
[SPEAKER_12]: step forward, you go three steps back.

1946
02:36:33,474 --> 02:36:41,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Please, send a letter to this committee and let them know that we're in charge of the government.

1947
02:36:42,315 --> 02:36:43,455
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not in charge of us.

1948
02:36:44,055 --> 02:36:44,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1949
02:36:49,116 --> 02:36:49,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1950
02:36:49,676 --> 02:36:50,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

1951
02:36:50,076 --> 02:36:51,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1952
02:36:52,017 --> 02:36:52,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1953
02:36:52,517 --> 02:36:55,417
[SPEAKER_21]: Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

1954
02:36:56,177 --> 02:36:59,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Notice how when the speakers come up, every one of them is four

1955
02:36:59,875 --> 02:37:00,896
[SPEAKER_21]: this Home Rule petition.

1956
02:37:01,516 --> 02:37:06,820
[SPEAKER_21]: So the residents of Medford, 100% of us want this Home Rule petition.

1957
02:37:07,821 --> 02:37:13,265
[SPEAKER_21]: We have no public access TV to talk about this issue, to discuss it, and there you go.

1958
02:37:13,705 --> 02:37:19,550
[SPEAKER_21]: So it starts at the head, where there's no communication, there's censorship, and we can't get the word out.

1959
02:37:20,290 --> 02:37:23,272
[SPEAKER_21]: One councilor wants us to go out and pound the pavement and get the addresses.

1960
02:37:23,773 --> 02:37:29,637
[SPEAKER_21]: Give us access, we can go on TV, and then people will know about the issue because we can discuss the issue.

1961
02:37:30,037 --> 02:37:31,778
[SPEAKER_21]: We can tell them that it's like the U.S.

1962
02:37:31,818 --> 02:37:33,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Constitution for the country.

1963
02:37:33,718 --> 02:37:35,479
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a little constitution for the city.

1964
02:37:36,079 --> 02:37:37,139
[SPEAKER_21]: This is so important.

1965
02:37:37,599 --> 02:37:38,900
[SPEAKER_21]: I thank you, Councilor Marks.

1966
02:37:39,340 --> 02:37:40,740
[SPEAKER_21]: I thank you, Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

1967
02:37:41,020 --> 02:37:46,122
[SPEAKER_21]: The two of you have been doing that old saying, yeoman's work.

1968
02:37:46,582 --> 02:37:49,222
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for being so honest and so hardworking.

1969
02:37:53,364 --> 02:37:54,364
[SPEAKER_15]: You wish to speak, sir?

1970
02:37:54,824 --> 02:37:57,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Please present yourself to the podium and state your name and address for the record.

1971
02:37:58,105 --> 02:37:58,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

1972
02:37:59,512 --> 02:37:59,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1973
02:38:01,452 --> 02:38:04,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1974
02:38:07,273 --> 02:38:08,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, councillors.

1975
02:38:11,154 --> 02:38:12,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make this very brief.

1976
02:38:20,996 --> 02:38:28,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking about the proposed possible city of Medford charter review is to be or not to be, I guess that is the question.

1977
02:38:30,726 --> 02:38:48,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Please allow me to start by saying as of today, May 17, 2016, I'm neither for or against changing the city's charter from plan A to plan E nor to B or C. I'm just not that smart.

1978
02:38:50,430 --> 02:38:59,692
[SPEAKER_03]: However, after 28 years of having the same old charter of plan A government, maybe it's time to simply

1979
02:39:00,305 --> 02:39:01,866
[SPEAKER_03]: review our charter options.

1980
02:39:04,147 --> 02:39:12,151
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like a business corporation reviewing its business plan to better compete and be more successful.

1981
02:39:14,592 --> 02:39:29,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Even at our next election on November 8, 2016, the voters could, would, hopefully, simply elect a nine-person commission who can only

1982
02:39:29,667 --> 02:39:32,229
[SPEAKER_03]: make recommendations and nothing else.

1983
02:39:34,030 --> 02:39:49,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those recommendations, if any, would go on the following year's 2017 voting ballot, allowing all voters to decide yes or no to any proposed changes.

1984
02:39:51,240 --> 02:39:53,462
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, that I said.

1985
02:39:54,668 --> 02:40:07,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that some citizens want this process to go forward in the traditional way versus going the way of a home rule petition through the Massachusetts State House.

1986
02:40:08,958 --> 02:40:22,248
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is a monumental task and highly improbable to collect the required 5,300 signatures to put this question on the ballot.

1987
02:40:23,276 --> 02:40:29,319
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have that Miss Frazzuli type of gun hoe, go get them, back in the 80s.

1988
02:40:30,900 --> 02:40:40,385
[SPEAKER_03]: However, please note this charter review petition presently has about 1,500 signatures or more.

1989
02:40:42,767 --> 02:40:52,252
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I almost forgot to say the CPA ballot, which passed, only needed and had approximately

1990
02:40:53,340 --> 02:40:54,321
[SPEAKER_03]: 1750 signatures.

1991
02:40:56,742 --> 02:40:57,622
[SPEAKER_03]: How did that happen?

1992
02:41:01,624 --> 02:41:02,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Need I say more?

1993
02:41:02,804 --> 02:41:16,670
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wanted to repeat my song that I have done for five years every December and get a petition to get the owner occupied for real estate tax exemption on the ballot,

1994
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:22,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure the state would let me do that with 1,750 signatures.

1995
02:41:26,163 --> 02:41:28,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I need 20% of the registered voters.

1996
02:41:29,344 --> 02:41:32,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be 5,300 or more.

1997
02:41:32,745 --> 02:41:35,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have to be certified, verified, and all that jazz.

1998
02:41:42,608 --> 02:41:44,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't write the second page.

1999
02:41:45,089 --> 02:41:46,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just basically confused.

2000
02:41:47,530 --> 02:41:48,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dismayed.

2001
02:41:49,012 --> 02:41:55,054
[SPEAKER_03]: about Methods Home Rule petition by Massachusetts legislation, bill number 4227.

2002
02:41:57,895 --> 02:42:00,096
[SPEAKER_03]: What they did or what they did not do.

2003
02:42:02,776 --> 02:42:06,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm told this was a reverse Houdini.

2004
02:42:09,559 --> 02:42:16,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that means, but someone very intelligent told me that, and I have no idea, so maybe it's,

2005
02:42:17,351 --> 02:42:24,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I should change the title and call it Houdini Effect and use Andrew's words.

2006
02:42:25,713 --> 02:42:27,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you see it and now you don't.

2007
02:42:29,834 --> 02:42:30,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very confused.

2008
02:42:34,375 --> 02:42:35,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know nothing.

2009
02:42:37,636 --> 02:42:38,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion on the floor?

2010
02:42:44,517 --> 02:42:47,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if I could, so people viewing also know that

2011
02:42:48,401 --> 02:42:53,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I did reach out to the legislative research director for the committee on election laws.

2012
02:42:54,064 --> 02:42:55,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Her name is Yael Langer.

2013
02:42:56,485 --> 02:43:00,447
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked why the bill did not get a fair public hearing.

2014
02:43:02,148 --> 02:43:04,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said every committee has their own rules.

2015
02:43:05,630 --> 02:43:11,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently their rule states that not every bill will get a public hearing.

2016
02:43:11,693 --> 02:43:14,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's up to the chairman of the committee and the membership.

2017
02:43:15,516 --> 02:43:20,099
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was told by the research director of the Election Laws Committee.

2018
02:43:25,122 --> 02:43:27,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like sending a letter out, too, and so forth.

2019
02:43:27,363 --> 02:43:37,789
[SPEAKER_05]: But it seems to me, at this point, the way this went down, I don't think any letter, I don't think any alteration of anything is going to make this go through, to be quite honest with you.

2020
02:43:38,269 --> 02:43:44,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there are a number of elected officials walking around crying crocodile tears right now.

2021
02:43:45,841 --> 02:43:46,902
[SPEAKER_05]: that this bill was killed.

2022
02:43:47,763 --> 02:43:51,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think that's the case.

2023
02:43:51,786 --> 02:44:00,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're going to have to follow this through with the signatures and move forward that direction, Mr. President.

2024
02:44:00,874 --> 02:44:01,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2025
02:44:02,676 --> 02:44:03,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion?

2026
02:44:05,258 --> 02:44:07,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to lay on the table, Mr. President.

2027
02:44:08,324 --> 02:44:09,465
[SPEAKER_05]: or receive in place on file?

2028
02:44:09,545 --> 02:44:11,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to receive in place on file.

2029
02:44:11,206 --> 02:44:17,150
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor of the proposed matters received in place on file 16-498 offered by Councilor Marks.

2030
02:44:17,711 --> 02:44:20,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that C-Click Fix program be discussed.

2031
02:44:21,093 --> 02:44:21,634
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor?

2032
02:44:23,655 --> 02:44:24,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2033
02:44:24,636 --> 02:44:27,358
[SPEAKER_15]: You've discussed it some already with us.

2034
02:44:27,998 --> 02:44:28,779
[SPEAKER_05]: The C-Click Fix?

2035
02:44:28,819 --> 02:44:30,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was just one portion of it.

2036
02:44:32,741 --> 02:44:37,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, it was great news when C-Click Fix was implemented by this

2037
02:44:38,078 --> 02:44:38,858
[SPEAKER_05]: administration.

2038
02:44:39,699 --> 02:44:53,005
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, the intent is to allow residents like they do in Somerville to reach out to local government and get resolution to concerns that, uh, they're addressing, uh, via the electronic system.

2039
02:44:53,826 --> 02:44:57,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, as was mentioned a while back, see, click, fix.

2040
02:44:57,627 --> 02:45:02,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So someone sees a problem, they click in the system and the city fixes it.

2041
02:45:02,910 --> 02:45:05,131
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I think the reverse is happening now.

2042
02:45:05,688 --> 02:45:14,797
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go on to C-Click Fix, you can click on the different cases that are being submitted by residents.

2043
02:45:15,438 --> 02:45:18,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing what I'm seeing, Mr. President.

2044
02:45:20,252 --> 02:45:22,673
[SPEAKER_05]: C-Click fix has turned it to C-Click ignore.

2045
02:45:23,574 --> 02:45:35,900
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I'm seeing is a resident driving by, seeing a streetlight out, reporting at the corner of Riverside Ave, across from Pleasant Street, there's a streetlight out.

2046
02:45:36,420 --> 02:45:41,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how much more specific you can get, because streetlights aren't three feet apart.

2047
02:45:41,743 --> 02:45:45,505
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the corner of Riverside and Pleasant, there's a streetlight out.

2048
02:45:46,176 --> 02:45:50,221
[SPEAKER_05]: The city comes back and says, please provide the poll number for us.

2049
02:45:51,342 --> 02:45:59,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So the city gets the report, someone's telling them there's a light out, they go back to the resident, say please provide the poll number.

2050
02:46:00,168 --> 02:46:01,729
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one particular case.

2051
02:46:02,549 --> 02:46:07,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we had an incident South and Main Street, the intersection.

2052
02:46:07,230 --> 02:46:11,212
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know it's a very dangerous intersection and difficult to navigate.

2053
02:46:11,652 --> 02:46:15,353
[SPEAKER_05]: A resident wrote, please, could you have someone take a look at this intersection?

2054
02:46:15,753 --> 02:46:17,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in fear of crossing it.

2055
02:46:17,414 --> 02:46:19,274
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very difficult for me to navigate.

2056
02:46:19,915 --> 02:46:21,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Response back to the resident.

2057
02:46:22,415 --> 02:46:24,396
[SPEAKER_05]: State police controls that intersection.

2058
02:46:24,816 --> 02:46:25,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Call 396-0100.

2059
02:46:28,235 --> 02:46:31,423
[SPEAKER_05]: So here is a resident reporting a public safety issue.

2060
02:46:32,265 --> 02:46:32,987
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in fear.

2061
02:46:33,307 --> 02:46:34,992
[SPEAKER_05]: They click on the C-Flix click.

2062
02:46:38,191 --> 02:46:51,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the administration or someone from a city department should be reaching out to the state, whether it's state police, state highway, whoever it is, to resolve the issue, not go back to the resident and give a phone number, Mr. President.

2063
02:46:51,594 --> 02:46:55,475
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what I think this system was intended to do.

2064
02:46:56,235 --> 02:47:06,297
[SPEAKER_05]: And another incident, Elm Street, people are requesting a crosswalk and blinking light at the entrance to Wrights Pond, another dangerous intersection

2065
02:47:06,760 --> 02:47:08,220
[SPEAKER_05]: and something that needs to be looked at.

2066
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:11,141
[SPEAKER_05]: The response back, you need to call DCI.

2067
02:47:12,282 --> 02:47:20,084
[SPEAKER_05]: That may be well and good, and that may be an issue DCI should handle, but that's not what the response from the city should be.

2068
02:47:20,484 --> 02:47:21,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It shouldn't be pawning this off.

2069
02:47:22,304 --> 02:47:35,608
[SPEAKER_05]: When residents take the time to go and see Click Fix and report something, put a narrative down, give a thorough explanation on what's happening, they should not be responded in this fashion.

2070
02:47:36,403 --> 02:47:45,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we had crosswalking at, I think this was something Councilor Knight offered, crosswalk on Forest Street near Webster and Water Street.

2071
02:47:47,181 --> 02:47:51,303
[SPEAKER_05]: When McNally Park was done, I think Councilor Knight followed up and said, we need a crosswalk.

2072
02:47:51,323 --> 02:47:53,985
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people crossing there now because of the new park.

2073
02:47:54,465 --> 02:47:56,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So residents followed up on C-Click Fix.

2074
02:47:56,947 --> 02:47:57,908
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the comments.

2075
02:47:58,228 --> 02:47:59,869
[SPEAKER_05]: They said we were supposed to get a crosswalk.

2076
02:48:00,169 --> 02:48:00,970
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

2077
02:48:01,490 --> 02:48:03,792
[SPEAKER_05]: This was reported March 22, 2016.

2078
02:48:05,773 --> 02:48:07,274
[SPEAKER_05]: No response from the city.

2079
02:48:09,055 --> 02:48:11,317
[SPEAKER_05]: No response at all from the city.

2080
02:48:11,637 --> 02:48:14,579
[SPEAKER_05]: And Councilor Knight, I think, put it on well before that.

2081
02:48:14,918 --> 02:48:16,659
[SPEAKER_05]: too, for a response.

2082
02:48:17,540 --> 02:48:20,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Route 16, someone reported a dangerous sidewalk.

2083
02:48:20,822 --> 02:48:24,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, April 9th, no response from the city yet.

2084
02:48:25,765 --> 02:48:42,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, you know, it's great to roll out a program, and in theory it's a great program, but without the proper attention to this, this turns in nothing but, it seems to me, that residents are going to report and nothing's going to happen.

2085
02:48:43,807 --> 02:48:51,272
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city, from what I notice, is quick to close out items, because a closed item must report well for the city.

2086
02:48:51,852 --> 02:48:54,834
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's open, it still needs to be, something needs to be done.

2087
02:48:55,155 --> 02:48:58,277
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's closed, that means the city did something with this.

2088
02:48:58,777 --> 02:49:03,780
[SPEAKER_05]: So all these issues that I just reported, that haven't been resolved, are all closed.

2089
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:06,582
[SPEAKER_05]: According to the city, they're closed right now.

2090
02:49:07,032 --> 02:49:12,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you would get, if we asked for reports and there was 130 requests filed and 90 were closed.

2091
02:49:14,886 --> 02:49:16,968
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like a great turnaround from the city.

2092
02:49:17,529 --> 02:49:28,439
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't tell you that out of the 90, 99% of them have no action at all on them or the resident was just told to back up another tree because the city didn't want to get involved.

2093
02:49:28,879 --> 02:49:34,444
[SPEAKER_05]: When I report a public safety concern in this city, the city should not tell me to call another agency.

2094
02:49:34,805 --> 02:49:36,426
[SPEAKER_05]: This city should be calling the agency.

2095
02:49:36,747 --> 02:49:40,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they should be falling up on C click fix saying we reported it to

2096
02:49:40,370 --> 02:49:47,575
[SPEAKER_05]: DCR, DCR is going to look back, and as soon as I get a response, I will note it again in C-Click Fix so you're aware of what's going on.

2097
02:49:48,836 --> 02:49:56,061
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, the mayor can do all the ribbon cuttings and C-Click Fix and everything else, but it's not operating the way it's intended to.

2098
02:49:56,441 --> 02:49:57,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Just take a look.

2099
02:49:57,121 --> 02:50:01,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone can go on and check out C-Click Fix and look at the list of comments.

2100
02:50:01,945 --> 02:50:04,406
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not operating the way it should, Mr. President.

2101
02:50:05,007 --> 02:50:08,189
[SPEAKER_05]: We've sold the bill of goods that this is going to help communication.

2102
02:50:08,481 --> 02:50:20,048
[SPEAKER_05]: between City Hall and the residents, and we're going to get quicker action, and all we're getting is quicker responses to ignoring the residents of this community and inaction in this community, Mr. President.

2103
02:50:20,568 --> 02:50:23,870
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to let my thoughts be known on this program.

2104
02:50:24,931 --> 02:50:33,876
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it works very successful in Somerville, and I'm hoping that we can have equal success in Medford, but there has to be someone in control.

2105
02:50:34,276 --> 02:50:36,838
[SPEAKER_05]: As early as I mentioned, we had a condemned house.

2106
02:50:37,756 --> 02:50:41,599
[SPEAKER_05]: They sent it to Barry Clemente for a response.

2107
02:50:42,119 --> 02:50:47,602
[SPEAKER_05]: What is Barry, great guy, great officer, what is he going to do with a condemned house?

2108
02:50:48,743 --> 02:50:51,305
[SPEAKER_05]: That should have went to the building department immediately.

2109
02:50:52,025 --> 02:50:58,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So who's ever responsible for the oversight, and I haven't heard yet, I don't know, we were all supposed to be trained in this C-Click fix.

2110
02:50:58,810 --> 02:51:00,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anyone receive training?

2111
02:51:00,271 --> 02:51:02,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, maybe someone received training.

2112
02:51:03,213 --> 02:51:05,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't, and we asked for it on several occasions.

2113
02:51:07,102 --> 02:51:08,623
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we really have to take a look at this.

2114
02:51:08,663 --> 02:51:15,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope this is not just window dressing to say, Oh, we have another program because this is no different than our street sweeping program.

2115
02:51:15,707 --> 02:51:16,888
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a shell of a program.

2116
02:51:17,288 --> 02:51:21,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And the, any other program in this community, Mr. President, as far as I'm concerned.

2117
02:51:21,770 --> 02:51:22,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2118
02:51:22,631 --> 02:51:23,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello.

2119
02:51:23,531 --> 02:51:24,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2120
02:51:24,452 --> 02:51:30,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I was here the night, uh, that they rolled up the C-Click fix and there was only six people here.

2121
02:51:30,375 --> 02:51:34,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I was one of the six people and they explained it and how it works.

2122
02:51:35,573 --> 02:51:39,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of my biggest concerns was the comments that were on there.

2123
02:51:39,935 --> 02:51:46,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, C-CLINTS has turned into Facebook of repairs.

2124
02:51:47,718 --> 02:51:57,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand why the mayor's office is answering these complaints when the bulk of them are, the DPW should be handling this.

2125
02:51:58,563 --> 02:52:02,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they should have a person in their office assigned to this.

2126
02:52:03,864 --> 02:52:08,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Because as I say, the bulk of the calls that are being there are all DPW related.

2127
02:52:10,009 --> 02:52:11,770
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's no one in that office handling that.

2128
02:52:12,131 --> 02:52:13,872
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be assigned to one person in that office.

2129
02:52:14,313 --> 02:52:18,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, I think maybe we rushed it a little too quick, like we do all things in this town.

2130
02:52:18,636 --> 02:52:21,379
[SPEAKER_09]: We're quick to get it out there so we can say we got it.

2131
02:52:22,099 --> 02:52:31,127
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think maybe it needs to be reeled back in now and re-evaluated and rethought how it should be done and see the mistakes that are made on it.

2132
02:52:31,597 --> 02:52:33,458
[SPEAKER_09]: After, what are we, 60 days on to this thing?

2133
02:52:34,458 --> 02:52:44,741
[SPEAKER_09]: About 60 days, maybe it should be re-evaluated and maybe restructured so we don't get comment after comment after comment on the same thing.

2134
02:52:45,101 --> 02:52:48,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Make the comment one time, if you call it in, leave it there.

2135
02:52:48,722 --> 02:52:52,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need to see 17 other people commenting on the same problem.

2136
02:52:54,083 --> 02:53:00,125
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, like I said, it needs to be re-evaluated and I think it needs to get out of the mayor's office and be brought up to the DPW office.

2137
02:53:01,058 --> 02:53:03,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's where the problems are all, on the C-Click fixer.

2138
02:53:04,799 --> 02:53:05,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor.

2139
02:53:05,539 --> 02:53:06,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

2140
02:53:06,599 --> 02:53:08,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2141
02:53:08,600 --> 02:53:23,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Back when the C-Click fix program was rolled out, I questioned the city's ability to meet the objectives with the current staff, the demands of a deteriorating infrastructure and, quite frankly, a city hall that's embracing technology about 15 years too late.

2142
02:53:24,719 --> 02:53:30,564
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, Mr. President, we've made a number of requests for copies of the statistical reports.

2143
02:53:30,584 --> 02:53:32,585
[SPEAKER_10]: We've asked for training, so on and so forth.

2144
02:53:32,665 --> 02:53:37,349
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we all hold steadfast in wanting to get that information.

2145
02:53:37,409 --> 02:53:49,097
[SPEAKER_10]: So I might once again, Mr. President, request that the administration provide us with a quarterly report relative to the C-Click Fix Program, items that were issued, items that were resolved, and the resolution that was recommended.

2146
02:53:51,909 --> 02:54:01,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Council night that the city council receiver quarterly report on the efforts of the C click fix program on that motion.

2147
02:54:01,975 --> 02:54:02,156
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

2148
02:54:02,196 --> 02:54:04,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Citizen, if you'd like to speak, welcome.

2149
02:54:04,777 --> 02:54:06,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2150
02:54:06,739 --> 02:54:07,099
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2151
02:54:07,119 --> 02:54:08,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Gene Martin, 10 coming street.

2152
02:54:08,380 --> 02:54:18,486
[SPEAKER_22]: And, uh, I, I agree this program with Mr. Caraviello needs to be pulled back and stopped right now until we get our hands on handle on the city as a whole.

2153
02:54:18,566 --> 02:54:21,328
[SPEAKER_22]: And I remember Mr. Falco saying this, and I agree,

2154
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:25,021
[SPEAKER_22]: We need a city engineer for a traffic pattern.

2155
02:54:25,442 --> 02:54:35,666
[SPEAKER_22]: We need regular schedules for everything, because the C-Click fix is for tweaks when those things didn't happen.

2156
02:54:35,926 --> 02:54:36,987
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a tweaking system.

2157
02:54:37,087 --> 02:54:41,168
[SPEAKER_22]: It is not supposed to be for every pothole in the city.

2158
02:54:41,528 --> 02:54:47,071
[SPEAKER_22]: If the potholes were being filled on a regular basis, then if you see First Street has a pothole, then you put it in there.

2159
02:54:47,551 --> 02:54:49,613
[SPEAKER_22]: But this is going to demoralize the people.

2160
02:54:50,233 --> 02:54:53,995
[SPEAKER_22]: What's going to happen is it's going to backfire if she doesn't stop the program now.

2161
02:54:54,596 --> 02:54:58,959
[SPEAKER_22]: And I want her to succeed because if she fails, the city fails.

2162
02:54:58,979 --> 02:55:00,380
[SPEAKER_22]: I want you to understand that.

2163
02:55:00,460 --> 02:55:04,703
[SPEAKER_22]: If the mayor fails at her job, that means the city fails as a city.

2164
02:55:04,783 --> 02:55:06,084
[SPEAKER_22]: And I do not want to see that happen.

2165
02:55:06,404 --> 02:55:07,445
[SPEAKER_22]: So I want her to get it right.

2166
02:55:07,905 --> 02:55:09,266
[SPEAKER_22]: So she needs to pull back on that.

2167
02:55:10,046 --> 02:55:15,230
[SPEAKER_22]: And then she needs to get a handle on the city as a whole and start doing some systematic changes.

2168
02:55:15,967 --> 02:55:16,867
[SPEAKER_22]: That's going to demoralize.

2169
02:55:16,887 --> 02:55:26,231
[SPEAKER_22]: When she had the meetings of all the residents, and I went to one in West Medford, the number one complaint was everything had to do with the DPW.

2170
02:55:26,652 --> 02:55:28,653
[SPEAKER_22]: It was all DPW, DPW.

2171
02:55:28,673 --> 02:55:36,276
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, if you don't give back the resources, if you don't provide the resources to fix these problems, it doesn't matter.

2172
02:55:36,336 --> 02:55:40,218
[SPEAKER_22]: Then it becomes a joke.

2173
02:55:40,358 --> 02:55:40,938
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not a joke.

2174
02:55:41,018 --> 02:55:41,738
[SPEAKER_22]: Joke isn't the word.

2175
02:55:42,739 --> 02:55:43,719
[SPEAKER_22]: It becomes a farce.

2176
02:55:44,299 --> 02:55:44,960
[SPEAKER_22]: It becomes a farce.

2177
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:45,800
[SPEAKER_22]: It makes you feel good.

2178
02:55:46,203 --> 02:55:48,144
[SPEAKER_22]: but as nothing's being substantially done.

2179
02:55:48,745 --> 02:55:52,648
[SPEAKER_22]: So she needs to take back, I know she had ambition about it, stop it.

2180
02:55:53,871 --> 02:56:05,956
[SPEAKER_22]: and get it right, have a traffic engineer come in, do a whole sweep of the city, start doing a whole sweep, and if you have to, you have to prioritize DPW, just like you have to prioritize police.

2181
02:56:06,436 --> 02:56:12,119
[SPEAKER_22]: If you do not prioritize DPW, it doesn't matter how many computer programs we update.

2182
02:56:12,599 --> 02:56:20,822
[SPEAKER_22]: It really doesn't, because the potholes don't get filled, and everybody's gonna complain, and it's gonna be pothole city, and people are just gonna complain about the same problem over and over and over again.

2183
02:56:21,482 --> 02:56:22,943
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to have a systematic approach,

2184
02:56:23,818 --> 02:56:25,099
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you very much for listening.

2185
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:28,522
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you again for your patience, because I've talked a lot tonight.

2186
02:56:28,962 --> 02:56:29,243
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2187
02:56:29,563 --> 02:56:30,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Jean.

2188
02:56:31,224 --> 02:56:31,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

2189
02:56:31,825 --> 02:56:33,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2190
02:56:34,627 --> 02:56:36,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

2191
02:56:38,851 --> 02:56:43,435
[SPEAKER_06]: There are unfortunately a lot of disincentives to using C-Click Fix, and some of them have been mentioned.

2192
02:56:43,555 --> 02:56:44,956
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is that things don't happen.

2193
02:56:45,457 --> 02:56:49,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then you stop using it, and it erodes the faith that people have

2194
02:56:49,987 --> 02:56:50,707
[SPEAKER_06]: in that system.

2195
02:56:51,028 --> 02:57:01,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like how every six months somebody starts up a new social media thing that looks a lot like Twitter, and three people get invites to it, and they go on it, and then there's crickets, because nobody's on it.

2196
02:57:02,734 --> 02:57:03,735
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same sort of thing.

2197
02:57:03,915 --> 02:57:10,219
[SPEAKER_06]: If nothing ever happens with C-Click Fix, people will stop using it.

2198
02:57:10,879 --> 02:57:13,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing is that it is turning into Facebook.

2199
02:57:14,821 --> 02:57:17,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what sort of relationship we have with the folks who

2200
02:57:17,844 --> 02:57:27,482
[SPEAKER_06]: actually do the software and run CClickFix, but it might be worth looking at the commenting utility because what friends might have been telling me is that they go on there, they report something.

2201
02:57:28,195 --> 02:57:38,479
[SPEAKER_06]: and the reporting part is anonymous, but then people are on their checking and they see that their neighbor put in something they did, and then it turns to, you suck, no, your mom sucks, no, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2202
02:57:38,819 --> 02:57:42,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as you know, there is no recess monitor on the internet.

2203
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:44,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's not one there either.

2204
02:57:44,741 --> 02:57:54,364
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we need is for comments to be available for city officials to come in and say, this is what we're doing, or we hear you, or something like that, which you don't need

2205
02:57:54,777 --> 02:58:00,301
[SPEAKER_06]: is your neighbor starting up some kind of feud with you because they noticed that you handed them in on something.

2206
02:58:00,782 --> 02:58:17,715
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there is, you can upvote or downvote things, that makes sense to have people able to do, but if you can restrict the commenting to the city officials who are telling you how this is being fixed right now, yes please, that I think will make a little bit

2207
02:58:18,904 --> 02:58:19,704
[SPEAKER_06]: less chaos.

2208
02:58:20,464 --> 02:58:26,106
[SPEAKER_06]: We have people in this city who know how to handle this kind of situation.

2209
02:58:26,606 --> 02:58:33,267
[SPEAKER_06]: You have people in this city who work in tech support, who work in human services doing information and referral.

2210
02:58:33,907 --> 02:58:35,047
[SPEAKER_06]: They have these skills.

2211
02:58:35,087 --> 02:58:38,708
[SPEAKER_06]: They understand how these systems work because they use them for a living.

2212
02:58:39,228 --> 02:58:44,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not talk to some of these people about what happens when you have to refer a problem elsewhere?

2213
02:58:44,569 --> 02:58:48,070
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you make sure that that gets taken care of?

2214
02:58:48,521 --> 02:58:54,686
[SPEAKER_06]: hey, people do keep stats on how many help desk tickets you close out.

2215
02:58:55,066 --> 02:58:56,667
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you make sure those are taken care of?

2216
02:58:56,727 --> 02:58:59,389
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of quality control happens here?

2217
02:58:59,429 --> 02:59:12,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk to people who use these kinds of systems for a living, many of whom live here in Medford, and some of whom may work for the city, and see what their experience and skills can translate into.

2218
02:59:12,298 --> 02:59:17,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they can help come up with a system that can be implemented here in the city,

2219
02:59:17,512 --> 02:59:19,373
[SPEAKER_06]: where questions actually get answered.

2220
02:59:19,713 --> 02:59:26,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Tickets get closed out for a reason other than we have to make our numbers look good, and I don't feel like dealing with this one today.

2221
02:59:28,959 --> 02:59:31,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Folks do this work already in the city.

2222
02:59:31,981 --> 02:59:39,085
[SPEAKER_06]: The people who live here not only are the people to whom you are responsible, we're also pretty good resources.

2223
02:59:39,646 --> 02:59:44,328
[SPEAKER_06]: So that may be one way to look at things.

2224
02:59:44,989 --> 02:59:46,850
[SPEAKER_06]: We have human service agencies here

2225
02:59:47,427 --> 02:59:47,988
[SPEAKER_06]: in the city.

2226
02:59:48,589 --> 02:59:50,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Surely they do information and referral.

2227
02:59:50,832 --> 02:59:53,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of them have to document that if they receive outside grants.

2228
02:59:54,997 --> 02:59:57,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of them have to document that for the people who fund them.

2229
02:59:57,400 --> 03:00:01,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, this is what we did and how much of it, and this is how successful we were at it.

2230
03:00:02,046 --> 03:00:03,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Find out from them how that works.

2231
03:00:05,514 --> 03:00:07,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I would really like to see C-Click fix work.

2232
03:00:08,876 --> 03:00:10,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be really great if it did.

2233
03:00:11,177 --> 03:00:17,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I was at that meeting in West Medford, and I know that the other thing that folks complained about besides DPW was communication.

2234
03:00:19,400 --> 03:00:20,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the two big things.

2235
03:00:20,681 --> 03:00:22,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else was sort of way behind that.

2236
03:00:22,662 --> 03:00:26,243
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are ways to address both.

2237
03:00:26,584 --> 03:00:28,604
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be one if it were successful.

2238
03:00:29,025 --> 03:00:34,227
[SPEAKER_06]: If it doesn't get reeled in now, it's just never going to work because people will stop using it.

2239
03:00:35,539 --> 03:00:35,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2240
03:00:35,959 --> 03:00:41,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

2241
03:00:41,204 --> 03:00:41,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

2242
03:00:42,265 --> 03:00:49,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez at 281 Park Street and my experience with C-Click Fix in the past week has been at C-Click Harass.

2243
03:00:50,631 --> 03:01:00,960
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here to talk about the car on the sidewalk and someone got very upset that I had posted it on C-Click Fix and the next thing I knew it was, I saw you at the city council meeting speaking.

2244
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:02,961
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you walking your dog.

2245
03:01:03,682 --> 03:01:06,164
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you with your phone in your hand.

2246
03:01:06,625 --> 03:01:08,947
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what C-Clicks is supposed to be.

2247
03:01:09,187 --> 03:01:12,350
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone else said, it sounds like you're stalking this person.

2248
03:01:12,850 --> 03:01:14,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one from the city responded.

2249
03:01:14,652 --> 03:01:16,754
[SPEAKER_00]: This person harassed me for about three days.

2250
03:01:16,834 --> 03:01:18,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what is wrong with you?

2251
03:01:18,235 --> 03:01:19,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Just park on the street.

2252
03:01:20,477 --> 03:01:26,983
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got to the point that the police actually came down and ticketed the car, which is probably the opposite of the reaction that he was hoping for.

2253
03:01:27,531 --> 03:01:29,732
[SPEAKER_00]: because this person was unhinged.

2254
03:01:30,412 --> 03:01:32,513
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the first person that this has happened to.

2255
03:01:32,573 --> 03:01:40,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw someone else had posted about their toddler getting bitten by a dog and getting knocked to the ground by dogs in the park that were loose.

2256
03:01:41,257 --> 03:01:43,138
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got, oh, I know who you are.

2257
03:01:43,258 --> 03:01:43,879
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you.

2258
03:01:43,959 --> 03:01:45,099
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the woman in the hat.

2259
03:01:45,199 --> 03:01:46,460
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the woman who does this.

2260
03:01:46,960 --> 03:01:48,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just shouldn't come to the park.

2261
03:01:48,961 --> 03:01:50,742
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's monitoring these posts.

2262
03:01:51,553 --> 03:01:54,435
[SPEAKER_00]: And people shouldn't feel unsafe to use CClickFix.

2263
03:01:54,535 --> 03:01:59,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't feel unsafe, but that's pretty intimidating and crazy.

2264
03:01:59,297 --> 03:02:03,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to report the individual posts and say, can you take these posts down?

2265
03:02:03,419 --> 03:02:09,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take the whole thing down if this is the way that this is going to happen, because this is insanity.

2266
03:02:09,662 --> 03:02:12,324
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not right.

2267
03:02:12,384 --> 03:02:14,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has to be looking at this, or you just need to shut it down.

2268
03:02:16,106 --> 03:02:16,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2269
03:02:19,070 --> 03:02:20,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

2270
03:02:20,690 --> 03:02:21,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2271
03:02:21,350 --> 03:02:43,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I'd like to amend the motion to ask that the company that installed C-Click Fix come back and meet with our city to re-evaluate, not remove the program, but re-evaluate the program to fix the flaws in it and make it a little more workable so we don't have these multiple comments and these problems that happen.

2272
03:02:43,795 --> 03:02:44,955
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to work in other cities.

2273
03:02:45,695 --> 03:02:46,616
[SPEAKER_09]: It's with the same program.

2274
03:02:46,636 --> 03:02:48,216
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no reason why it can't work in ours.

2275
03:02:50,216 --> 03:02:53,077
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, we paid for a service.

2276
03:02:53,617 --> 03:02:58,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get the company back here, reevaluate it, how the program works.

2277
03:02:58,599 --> 03:03:00,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all these programs are all very adjustable.

2278
03:03:01,480 --> 03:03:06,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know we have plenty of smart people in our town that can do this, but again, this is a service that we paid for.

2279
03:03:06,662 --> 03:03:09,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get it fixed correctly and get it up and running.

2280
03:03:09,663 --> 03:03:16,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if we have to shut it down for a little spec to get it fixed correctly, it is a viable program, and I want to see it working correctly.

2281
03:03:17,722 --> 03:03:18,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2282
03:03:18,483 --> 03:03:19,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Lugar.

2283
03:03:19,523 --> 03:03:20,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

2284
03:03:21,405 --> 03:03:23,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I, too, want to see it work, and I think it can work.

2285
03:03:23,667 --> 03:03:27,630
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure Councilor Schiappelli will follow up with how it does work in Somerville.

2286
03:03:28,911 --> 03:03:30,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it needs to be shut down.

2287
03:03:30,572 --> 03:03:32,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it needs to be monitored.

2288
03:03:34,095 --> 03:03:43,342
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to have regulations so the monitor knows when to pull something, when to maybe take it off and send it directly to a department head.

2289
03:03:43,822 --> 03:03:45,984
[SPEAKER_07]: And a monitor, somebody who will take

2290
03:03:46,277 --> 03:03:53,159
[SPEAKER_07]: the effort to maybe call DCR or the state to get a simple resolution to the problem.

2291
03:03:53,819 --> 03:04:01,701
[SPEAKER_07]: It just is going to take some time, energy, a monitor, somebody working on it on a daily basis, whether that be somebody in the mayor's office, somebody in the DPW.

2292
03:04:02,181 --> 03:04:09,063
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like something we, I think, asked for when we originally were pushing for this and we found out it was going to be a reality.

2293
03:04:09,463 --> 03:04:11,184
[SPEAKER_07]: We did ask who was going to monitor this.

2294
03:04:11,660 --> 03:04:14,702
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seems like we have no oversight, and that's all we need.

2295
03:04:14,742 --> 03:04:16,543
[SPEAKER_07]: We need oversight and regulations.

2296
03:04:16,964 --> 03:04:25,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that that can be done in minimal time to not disrupt the program for more than, you know, a few weeks to get it done and get it done right.

2297
03:04:25,710 --> 03:04:38,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would make the recommendation that we get a monitor and get rules and regulations put, you know, with regards to the types of posts that should be on there and obviously somebody to stop the harassment.

2298
03:04:38,118 --> 03:04:38,879
[SPEAKER_07]: That's ridiculous.

2299
03:04:42,440 --> 03:04:43,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2300
03:04:43,441 --> 03:04:58,010
[SPEAKER_16]: And, again, this is, I think, one time or another, every councilor has talked about this issue, whether it be, is there enough staffing to field all these issues?

2301
03:04:58,550 --> 03:05:00,331
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, there's not.

2302
03:05:01,772 --> 03:05:08,156
[SPEAKER_16]: But one thing we're seeing is we have enough negative blogs in this community, and this is what it's turned out to be.

2303
03:05:12,457 --> 03:05:16,000
[SPEAKER_16]: something we talked about looking, maybe it shouldn't be see, click, fix, but just see, click.

2304
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:28,248
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can grab that data to show where we need the assistance, what departments really need that help.

2305
03:05:29,269 --> 03:05:31,590
[SPEAKER_16]: In Somerville, it's a different process.

2306
03:05:32,231 --> 03:05:34,312
[SPEAKER_16]: The process is a 3-1-1 process.

2307
03:05:34,712 --> 03:05:37,534
[SPEAKER_16]: See, click, fix is a process before 3-1-1.

2308
03:05:38,695 --> 03:05:41,417
[SPEAKER_16]: So using the assistance of Harvard University,

2309
03:05:42,408 --> 03:05:54,633
[SPEAKER_16]: that will come into the community like they have in my office and working for free to put a process in place that will help your community function the way it needs to function.

2310
03:05:55,113 --> 03:05:57,714
[SPEAKER_16]: This is too big to what we're seeing is happening here.

2311
03:05:58,915 --> 03:06:01,196
[SPEAKER_16]: We need the assistance from people that have gone through it already.

2312
03:06:02,456 --> 03:06:11,700
[SPEAKER_16]: When we see that, when we collect that data, then you have a 311 system that's in place that I have 22 lights out at Dillboy Stadium.

2313
03:06:12,620 --> 03:06:27,087
[SPEAKER_16]: I go to my office, I go right to my email, 311, I put to the department, it goes to an office, within 15 minutes I get a response email with a ticket number.

2314
03:06:27,587 --> 03:06:30,088
[SPEAKER_16]: That ticket number goes directly to the department head.

2315
03:06:31,229 --> 03:06:37,072
[SPEAKER_16]: The department head then follows up with my department head, knowing that this is coming from in the city.

2316
03:06:38,052 --> 03:06:40,013
[SPEAKER_16]: This isn't a blog that goes around and saying,

2317
03:06:40,363 --> 03:06:44,804
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you picked me out, so I'm going to start egging your house, or I'm going to come after your dog or whatnot.

2318
03:06:46,005 --> 03:06:49,266
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a system that's supposed to be set up to help this community grow.

2319
03:06:50,686 --> 03:06:54,387
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think going forward, I don't see click fix.

2320
03:06:54,867 --> 03:06:55,908
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not working right now.

2321
03:06:56,468 --> 03:07:09,332
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know it was at least in good spirit to get something going in a positive direction, but all it's turned into right now is negative banter.

2322
03:07:10,670 --> 03:07:14,271
[SPEAKER_16]: because I don't think we have the tools in place to fix.

2323
03:07:15,512 --> 03:07:35,000
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I support my colleagues in going forward with this, but I think that, I know council president has already set a date to meet with the mayor, and I think this is one of the tools that we can actually talk and sit with her and say, this is what we're hearing, this is what we're seeing, this is what other communities have done.

2324
03:07:37,380 --> 03:07:48,348
[SPEAKER_16]: let's not reinvent the wheel, but let's start a process, not just to complain and block negatively, but find a way down the line that there's a solution.

2325
03:07:49,569 --> 03:07:52,691
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I appreciate Council Marks for bringing this up.

2326
03:07:52,791 --> 03:07:59,736
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate, I think every single one of us that have in one time or another put a resolution through that talked about this.

2327
03:07:59,816 --> 03:08:03,759
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, and I think, I think we need it.

2328
03:08:03,799 --> 03:08:05,861
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we're all starving something positive.

2329
03:08:06,101 --> 03:08:06,201
[SPEAKER_16]: So,

2330
03:08:06,726 --> 03:08:07,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2331
03:08:07,746 --> 03:08:08,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2332
03:08:08,107 --> 03:08:09,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2333
03:08:09,027 --> 03:08:09,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco.

2334
03:08:10,007 --> 03:08:11,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2335
03:08:11,248 --> 03:08:18,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, let me just start off, um, this has come up at least three times in the past five months.

2336
03:08:19,271 --> 03:08:20,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and I support.

2337
03:08:25,655 --> 03:08:29,297
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do a lot of goal setting and trying to figure out how many puddles we fix here.

2338
03:08:29,337 --> 03:08:32,379
[SPEAKER_08]: So you look at the metrics and see what kind of data is coming in.

2339
03:08:32,399 --> 03:08:33,919
[SPEAKER_08]: You can really measure things.

2340
03:08:33,999 --> 03:08:36,241
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be a very effective tool.

2341
03:08:48,887 --> 03:08:50,149
[SPEAKER_08]: if it's managed properly.

2342
03:08:50,809 --> 03:08:57,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really feel that this is a system that we have, it's a tool that we have, but it's not managed properly if it's managed at all.

2343
03:08:58,537 --> 03:09:04,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a resolution back a couple of months ago with regards to the same thing about how it's being used as a walker.

2344
03:09:04,283 --> 03:09:11,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone was walking their dog, and someone actually took a picture of the person walking their dog, and it ended up on scene quick fix.

2345
03:09:11,850 --> 03:09:15,311
[SPEAKER_08]: a picture of another person should never end up in that same event.

2346
03:09:15,431 --> 03:09:17,371
[SPEAKER_08]: It came down, but it shouldn't end up there.

2347
03:09:17,911 --> 03:09:23,592
[SPEAKER_08]: So back then, I had questions about policies, procedures, and I wanted the administration to send us something back.

2348
03:09:24,052 --> 03:09:27,213
[SPEAKER_08]: We have not received anything back yet on that.

2349
03:09:27,353 --> 03:09:33,094
[SPEAKER_08]: We should be, I honestly feel, Consul Caraviello was part of the point.

2350
03:09:33,154 --> 03:09:34,274
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they did offer training.

2351
03:09:34,674 --> 03:09:38,135
[SPEAKER_08]: They did, but it was at five o'clock in the afternoon.

2352
03:09:38,235 --> 03:09:39,395
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, with all due respect,

2353
03:09:40,897 --> 03:09:45,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Having a meeting at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, you're really not going to get that many people here.

2354
03:09:45,118 --> 03:09:51,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the world is still working on their way home or attending to their kids and getting dinner ready.

2355
03:09:51,580 --> 03:09:59,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you want to have a successful program and you want to train and you really want to roll it out properly, you have to make sure you communicate it right and then you train people.

2356
03:10:00,872 --> 03:10:08,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this committee could probably benefit from a training session to see how the program works, when a ticket comes in or an issue is filed, where it goes.

2357
03:10:08,918 --> 03:10:11,139
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if it goes to City Hall, what happens then?

2358
03:10:11,159 --> 03:10:13,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you outlined it in the process this summer.

2359
03:10:13,721 --> 03:10:14,081
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.

2360
03:10:14,362 --> 03:10:16,503
[SPEAKER_08]: That process has never been outlined for us here.

2361
03:10:17,264 --> 03:10:19,545
[SPEAKER_08]: But we really need to see that.

2362
03:10:19,565 --> 03:10:22,087
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a training would be beneficial for this council.

2363
03:10:22,467 --> 03:10:25,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to see a committee in the whole meeting to grab just a secret fix.

2364
03:10:25,890 --> 03:10:26,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I think one hour.

2365
03:10:28,052 --> 03:10:32,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be beneficial to everyone in this room.

2366
03:10:33,459 --> 03:10:38,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be beneficial to the program, and I think it would really help make this a success.

2367
03:10:38,146 --> 03:10:41,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to bring in the vendor and see if we can make some tweaks to it.

2368
03:10:43,608 --> 03:10:47,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a good program, but I think it really has to be managed properly.

2369
03:10:47,191 --> 03:10:50,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have some reservations right now about how it's being managed.

2370
03:10:51,074 --> 03:10:53,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is someone actually looking at this on a regular basis?

2371
03:10:54,236 --> 03:10:56,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, the purpose is to get things fixed.

2372
03:10:56,698 --> 03:11:01,322
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, there have been great points that have been made tonight about staffing.

2373
03:11:02,103 --> 03:11:03,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be honest with you, I think we're terribly understaffed.

2374
03:11:05,265 --> 03:11:10,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're doing everything they possibly can to keep up with the tickets, the Sequel Fix tickets.

2375
03:11:11,030 --> 03:11:12,351
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I mean, at some point,

2376
03:11:13,617 --> 03:11:20,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I think right now we have between 9 and 12 people that work for the DW.

2377
03:11:20,162 --> 03:11:23,704
[SPEAKER_08]: 9 to 12 people in a city this big.

2378
03:11:24,645 --> 03:11:28,488
[SPEAKER_08]: And if that's not more people, we need to increase staff to keep up with this.

2379
03:11:29,248 --> 03:11:40,818
[SPEAKER_08]: But, getting back to see quick fix, we need to make sure that we take a look at this, we get some sort of training, and we need to figure out how this runs, and who manages it, and make sure it's managed properly.

2380
03:11:40,838 --> 03:11:56,992
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I think we should definitely have, maybe the whole meeting, it's come up before, we'll need to have this, we need to jump on top of this, I mean, we can talk about it all night, but we really need to sit down and take a look at this, figure out who's managing it, if anyone's managing it, make sure it's managed properly, managed properly, going into the future.

2381
03:11:57,652 --> 03:12:04,718
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to make a quick suggestion that as we go lurching into the world of social media here we

2382
03:12:23,094 --> 03:12:41,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to respectfully request that if we could also make, as part of this movement, some training for the police in Medford who may not be as familiar with the way crime and harassment can take place on the internet and on social media and bullying and such.

2383
03:12:42,960 --> 03:12:47,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a number of friends who have been doxed by various people.

2384
03:12:47,821 --> 03:12:49,482
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a phenomenon where

2385
03:12:49,948 --> 03:13:04,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody goes out, finds their personal information, posts it online in a public place, sometimes it's just their name, address, phone number, sometimes it's their social security number or whatever, and encourages people to do threatening things to them.

2386
03:13:06,073 --> 03:13:09,814
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my friends who experienced this lives in Medford, called the Medford police.

2387
03:13:10,358 --> 03:13:12,259
[SPEAKER_06]: because they felt that they were in danger.

2388
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:19,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And the police really had no idea of what to do with this sort of threat.

2389
03:13:20,084 --> 03:13:23,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were like, well, that's what kids are like on the internet these days.

2390
03:13:23,285 --> 03:13:25,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Why'd you back down from the fight?

2391
03:13:28,568 --> 03:13:36,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's what some people are like on the internet, but that's also what crime and threat look like these days in a lot of situations.

2392
03:13:37,077 --> 03:13:41,661
[SPEAKER_06]: That is one of the tools and the weapons that people who harass and bully people use.

2393
03:13:42,181 --> 03:13:51,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that continuing education for the police force as to how to handle that sort of thing would be really, really helpful just for the safety of people here in Medford.

2394
03:13:51,930 --> 03:13:52,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2395
03:13:52,150 --> 03:13:52,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

2396
03:13:53,151 --> 03:13:54,732
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion, all those in favor?

2397
03:13:54,752 --> 03:13:54,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

2398
03:13:55,353 --> 03:13:56,193
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

2399
03:13:56,213 --> 03:13:59,656
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion carries.

2400
03:13:59,676 --> 03:14:05,341
[SPEAKER_15]: 16-499, offered by Vice President Langel, currently resolved that the Director of our Energy and Environment Office

2401
03:14:05,795 --> 03:14:10,777
[SPEAKER_15]: work on ways to reduce water consumption within all our municipal and school buildings.

2402
03:14:10,837 --> 03:14:11,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President.

2403
03:14:11,957 --> 03:14:13,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

2404
03:14:15,218 --> 03:14:17,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I put this on last week, Ms.

2405
03:14:17,059 --> 03:14:25,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Hunt, our Energy and Environment Director, did email me a number of ways that the city is working on water consumption.

2406
03:14:25,701 --> 03:14:30,223
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know how much she would want me to share of what she sent to me personally.

2407
03:14:30,835 --> 03:14:42,818
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could get it in writing to the whole council with regards to any and everything that has been done to preserve water within our city buildings, that would be my first amendment.

2408
03:14:43,358 --> 03:14:55,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, if we can get an idea with regards to the possibility or if she's looked into any potential grants with regards to whether it be replacing faucets or toilets within our public buildings.

2409
03:14:56,184 --> 03:15:06,065
[SPEAKER_07]: The city currently uses, I believe from what a commissioner told me, is $400,000 worth of water, or approximately close to that.

2410
03:15:07,291 --> 03:15:08,352
[SPEAKER_07]: in our city buildings.

2411
03:15:08,412 --> 03:15:15,678
[SPEAKER_07]: So that obviously is not being recorded accurately and it's being passed on to the rate payer.

2412
03:15:15,958 --> 03:15:27,447
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where my resolve comes from and that's where I would like to see the city do more to conserve water in our public buildings and focus less of a burden on our taxpayers.

2413
03:15:28,067 --> 03:15:33,351
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will follow up on this at a later date after we get some answers from our

2414
03:15:34,272 --> 03:15:46,463
[SPEAKER_07]: just put it in writing as far as everything that's been done, as far as to possibly make any grants because I do know that placing a toilet is expensive, is it even worth it?

2415
03:15:47,083 --> 03:15:48,845
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we'd have to do a cost estimate.

2416
03:15:49,610 --> 03:16:17,992
[SPEAKER_07]: cost estimate evaluation, so are there grants available to do something like that, whether it be in our schools or in our public buildings to try to conserve water usage, just like any, if you go to any environmental festival or fair, there's always people there telling you what to do with your homes, how to update your home, replace the toilet, replace the faucets, to make it, you know, obviously, a lot of people do take steps in their homes to do it, so I'm asking the question,

2417
03:16:18,993 --> 03:16:30,639
[SPEAKER_07]: and then Medford are working to make sure any grants are available to take some of that burden of replacing things and further updating what we've already, you know, what we've approved for Mr. Mayor.

2418
03:16:30,959 --> 03:16:33,020
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion as amended, Councilor Knight.

2419
03:16:33,940 --> 03:16:35,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2420
03:16:36,281 --> 03:16:45,085
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been brought up a number of times, I think, by Councilor Mack, actually, concerning whether or not the city actually monitors the use of water in its buildings as well as its school buildings.

2421
03:16:45,225 --> 03:16:48,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that in order for us to accurately

2422
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:52,442
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're going to reduce water consumption, we first need to gauge what we're taking in.

2423
03:16:52,483 --> 03:17:02,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to ask for an update from the administration as to whether or not they are metering our city and school buildings at this point in time, because it was my understanding that they were not the last time we asked the question.

2424
03:17:03,370 --> 03:17:08,033
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be able to gauge conservation if we're not able to gauge consumption, Mr. President.

2425
03:17:08,473 --> 03:17:12,376
[SPEAKER_10]: So unless we're able to do that, I think, you know, it's off and on.

2426
03:17:13,176 --> 03:17:16,659
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion as amended by Councilors Lungo-Koehn, and

2427
03:17:18,724 --> 03:17:19,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor.

2428
03:17:20,344 --> 03:17:26,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight is correct that the municipal buildings are not needed.

2429
03:17:27,006 --> 03:17:33,587
[SPEAKER_05]: The water that's consumed in any of the municipal buildings fall under unaccounted for water, which the ratepayers pay.

2430
03:17:34,127 --> 03:17:35,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the ratepayer pays anyway.

2431
03:17:35,988 --> 03:17:39,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's half a dozen, one dozen or the other.

2432
03:17:40,649 --> 03:17:45,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as I know, the high school has done a tremendous job on conservation.

2433
03:17:46,765 --> 03:17:51,028
[SPEAKER_05]: They have locked about three quarters of their bathrooms up so you can't use them.

2434
03:17:51,828 --> 03:17:54,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And about 90% of the bubblers don't work.

2435
03:17:54,950 --> 03:17:57,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know they've been working on conservation for a number of years.

2436
03:17:58,431 --> 03:18:01,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe that's the intent here at City Hall.

2437
03:18:01,193 --> 03:18:03,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor, that's a public safety effort because of the lead pipes.

2438
03:18:04,395 --> 03:18:06,416
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be part of it, Mr. President.
