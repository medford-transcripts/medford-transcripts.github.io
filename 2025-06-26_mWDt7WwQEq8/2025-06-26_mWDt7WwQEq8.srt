29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,281
[SPEAKER_38]: We have Sal DeStefano, who is our economic development director.

00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:57,084
[SPEAKER_38]: We have Derek Seeger, who is our graduate student intern and helping to take minutes tonight.

31
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:03,946

33
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:11,349
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think I've got everybody.

34
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,730
[SPEAKER_38]: Full house.

35
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:16,457
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much.

36
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:21,339
[SPEAKER_39]: So tonight's meeting, we're going to start with the non-public hearing meetings.

37
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,980
[SPEAKER_39]: And so the first item on the agenda is a site plan modification for 421 to 423 High Street.

38
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:33,562
[SPEAKER_39]: Danielle or someone on the staff, can you please give your introductory remarks?

39
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:35,742
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

40
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:40,404
[SPEAKER_38]: So this was a project that was previously approved.

41
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:54,711
[SPEAKER_38]: original applicant and property owner, you have got the project permitted, got the state plan review, got the variances from the zoning board.

42
00:02:55,351 --> 00:03:00,053
[SPEAKER_38]: And in the interim, they sold to a new developer.

43
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:12,657
[SPEAKER_38]: And there was some kind of mix up where there were some changes that naturally crop up when you get to the

44
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:31,803
[SPEAKER_38]: construction document level of drawings, and there were some window openings and different changes like that that are not considered de minimis, so it cannot be approved administratively by our office.

45
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:42,532
[SPEAKER_38]: So although staff worked with the applicant to make sure that the changes were keeping with the spirit and goals of the original approval,

46
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:49,236
[SPEAKER_38]: it needed to go back to you all to prove the new control documents.

47
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:53,299
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

48
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,082
[SPEAKER_39]: And who is representing the proponent this evening?

49
00:03:58,923 --> 00:03:59,464
[SPEAKER_38]: C.J.

50
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:03,987
[SPEAKER_38]: Daugherty's iPhone is the person C.J.

51
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:07,914
[SPEAKER_39]: Shall I unmute him?

52
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:09,215
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

53
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:18,162
[SPEAKER_39]: And are there any others that will need to be unmuted so that I can identify ahead of time to make sure that you have access for your presentation?

54
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:20,664
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm unsure.

55
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:21,845
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

56
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,386
[SPEAKER_39]: We can start with CJ.

57
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:26,348
[SPEAKER_39]: Hello.

58
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:27,969
[SPEAKER_39]: Hello.

59
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:34,895
[SPEAKER_39]: Would you like to give us a quick overview of your application?

60
00:04:35,976 --> 00:05:02,992
[SPEAKER_26]: sure sure i i wasn't fully prepared to present um so the situation as um danielle spoke about um we purchased the project post uh issuance of the permit from the building department um and we wanted to make a minor change to the exterior facade of the building uh when we submitted that there was a realization that the plan approved by your board didn't match the plan that was um

61
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:06,456
[SPEAKER_26]: ultimately approved.

62
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:14,223
[SPEAKER_26]: So we made changes to sort of reconcile the differences as close we could given the structural limitations after design.

63
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:18,467
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's just some relocation of windows and things like that.

64
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,089
[SPEAKER_26]: It's fairly superficial.

65
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:25,814
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're hoping that the board can approve those so we can continue with the work.

66
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:28,937
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much, Mr. Dougherty.

67
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:40,180
[SPEAKER_39]: I will ask the board now if there is any questions in reference to the proponent's request.

68
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:44,564
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't think so.

69
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:49,208
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, I think this is something we've seen come through with a few other projects recently.

70
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:56,074
[SPEAKER_33]: And we've been more careful with our wording of approvals to make sure that we don't run into this.

71
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:57,815
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

72
00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:59,657
[SPEAKER_33]: Because we don't want to have these kind of things happen.

73
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:01,603
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

74
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:01,883
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

75
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:09,287
[SPEAKER_39]: And just to save the time of the public and ourselves, as well as the proponent, I think this could have been administratively handled.

76
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:15,670
[SPEAKER_39]: And with that, I will, I will ask if there's any public comment before I move for a motion to approve.

77
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:19,972
[SPEAKER_39]: And I'm using two screens.

78
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,274
[SPEAKER_39]: So if anyone can help me, if there's any hands, any

79
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:32,155
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't see any, so I'm going to actually just move for approval so that we can let Ms.

80
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:33,835
[SPEAKER_39]: Fidority be all set.

81
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:36,857
[SPEAKER_39]: So I would need a motion to approve.

82
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,118
[SPEAKER_39]: I so move.

83
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,479
[SPEAKER_39]: I can second.

84
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,980
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, I move.

85
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,482
[SPEAKER_39]: Awesome, and I'm going to go in order.

86
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:47,122
[SPEAKER_39]: Peter Cowles?

87
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:48,023
[SPEAKER_35]: Aye.

88
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:49,443
[SPEAKER_39]: Ari Fishman?

89
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:50,224
[SPEAKER_39]: Aye.

90
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:51,705
[SPEAKER_39]: Sabrina Alpino?

91
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:52,705
[SPEAKER_39]: Aye.

92
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:54,126
[SPEAKER_39]: Adam Behrens?

93
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:55,605
[SPEAKER_35]: Aye.

94
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:57,026
[SPEAKER_39]: Eddie String.

95
00:06:57,886 --> 00:06:58,026
[SPEAKER_39]: Aye.

96
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,287
[SPEAKER_39]: Ben Lavalle.

97
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:00,487
[SPEAKER_35]: Aye.

98
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,749
[SPEAKER_39]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

99
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:03,249
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm an aye.

100
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:06,310
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much for taking the time to come before us.

101
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,411
[SPEAKER_39]: Mr. Dougherty, you are all set and it's been approved.

102
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:09,392
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

103
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:10,052
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

104
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:10,692
[SPEAKER_26]: Appreciate it.

105
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:11,873
[SPEAKER_39]: Have a great evening.

106
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,236
[SPEAKER_39]: The second item.

107
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:24,384
[SPEAKER_39]: on our agenda this evening is 401 Boston Avenue.

108
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,105
[SPEAKER_39]: It's a site plan review for Dover amendment use.

109
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:30,327
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to read the public notice.

110
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:32,676
[SPEAKER_39]: public hearing notice.

111
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:38,700
[SPEAKER_39]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on November 20th, 2024 after 6.30 p.m.

112
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:54,872
[SPEAKER_39]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review submitted by trustees of Tufts College and Capstone Development Partners LLC to construct a 677-bed dormitory consisting of two 10-story buildings totaling

113
00:07:55,392 --> 00:08:06,762
[SPEAKER_39]: 275,079 square feet, of which 4,000 square feet will be ground floor commercial at the site of the existing surface parking lot at 401 Boston Avenue, Medford Mass, 02155.

114
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:17,611
[SPEAKER_39]: The project is subject to site plan review for Dover Amendment uses per the City of Medford Zone and Ordinance Section 94-11.8 and requires approval from the Community Development Board.

115
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:24,895
[SPEAKER_39]: This will be the first public hearing and no votes will be taken tonight except to continue the public hearing until a date certain.

116
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:33,918
[SPEAKER_39]: But I am going to ask, we're opening up the public hearing this evening to start the voting on the approval process.

117
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:38,580
[SPEAKER_39]: And I'm going to ask the staff for any introductory remarks for 401 Boston Avenue.

118
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:43,142
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

119
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:44,743
[SPEAKER_38]: Again, Daniel Evans, Senior Planner.

120
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:53,270
[SPEAKER_38]: I'll just restate that this is a site plan review under the Dover amendment.

121
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,132
[SPEAKER_38]: So that's a more limited review per ordinance.

122
00:08:57,452 --> 00:09:06,917
[SPEAKER_38]: The two questions that the board is to ask is, one, does the use qualify for protection under the Dover amendment?

123
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:08,458
[SPEAKER_38]: And if the answer is yes,

124
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:21,500
[SPEAKER_38]: The second inquiry is really is what reasonable regulations concerning the bulk and height of structures and determining yard sizes, lot areas, setbacks, open space, parking and building coverage requirements, if any, should be imposed on the use.

125
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:32,387
[SPEAKER_38]: So the board's allowable actions are to approve, approve with conditions, or deny, but you can only deny for a failure to provide the necessary information.

126
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:36,764
[SPEAKER_38]: It's similar to the last meeting.

127
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:40,565
[SPEAKER_38]: We also had a Dover amendment used, so it's kind of like the same process for that.

128
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:54,651
[SPEAKER_38]: So unless Director Hunt has anything to say, I believe, who from the Tufts team should we make a co-host or unmute?

129
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:03,294
[SPEAKER_39]: Is there someone from the Tufts team that would be doing the presentation?

130
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,257
[SPEAKER_39]: Don Rocco DiRico.

131
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,118
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

132
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:08,739
[SPEAKER_32]: I think Rocco DiRico will kick us off.

133
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,920
[SPEAKER_39]: OK, awesome.

134
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,082
[SPEAKER_39]: And also, Mr. Gallagher, will you be presenting as well?

135
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:14,003
[SPEAKER_39]: Do you need access?

136
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:19,347
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll be available to take any questions, Madam Chair, I think.

137
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:25,951
[SPEAKER_32]: And I sent Alicia, Director Hunt, pardon me, a list of folks who will be presenting on our team.

138
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:27,372
[SPEAKER_39]: OK, awesome.

139
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:27,813
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

140
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:40,873
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, and I apologize, but from looking away, I'm using two screens, so I'm trying to keep up.

141
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,557
[SPEAKER_39]: I do not see Rocco, actually.

142
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,740
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm right here, Madam Chair.

143
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,661
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, there you are.

144
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:49,503
[SPEAKER_38]: Hello.

145
00:10:49,703 --> 00:10:56,470
[SPEAKER_38]: Pardon the interruption, there's also another individual who messaged me that needs to be able to have screen sharing, Ross Cameron, and I cannot.

146
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:56,811
[SPEAKER_38]: I have.

147
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I have the list and I'm doing that.

148
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:16,734
[SPEAKER_24]: And so for your team, can I just ask that as you all are presenting, if you need the next person to speak and they don't have co-host or whatever, if they can use the raise hand function, that'll pop them to the top of my screen and make it very easy for us to unmute them as needed.

149
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:20,935
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's just, it makes it simpler for the process.

150
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:30,781
[SPEAKER_24]: And just so the public is clear, after they present, then things will be open for public comment and the Zoom will help us keep a queue of who's raised their hands.

151
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:44,968
[SPEAKER_39]: It will be opened after in a different order, Director Hunt, but I will reiterate that.

152
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:04,179
[SPEAKER_30]: Madam Chair, would you like me to start?

153
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,860
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, please go right ahead.

154
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:06,781
[SPEAKER_30]: Great.

155
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:08,663
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

156
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:10,746
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Director Hunt, Danielle.

157
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:19,375
[SPEAKER_30]: For being here tonight, my name is Rocco DiRico, and I'm the Executive Director of Government Community Relations at Tufts University.

158
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:23,979
[SPEAKER_30]: Tufts University is a mission-driven nonprofit

159
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:34,565
[SPEAKER_30]: organization that educates more than 6,000 undergraduate students on our Medford campus, and a key part of that mission is providing on-campus housing for our students.

160
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:44,858
[SPEAKER_30]: I am here tonight to discuss an exciting new housing project on Boston Avenue that meets many of the city's and the university's shared goals.

161
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:56,585
[SPEAKER_30]: On-campus housing, mixed-use development, transit-oriented design, and an energy-efficient building design that meets the city's specialized stretch energy code.

162
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:04,117
[SPEAKER_30]: I've worked at Tufts University for the past eight years, and during that time, housing has been a top priority for the university.

163
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:15,385
[SPEAKER_30]: We have added more than 700 on-campus beds through conversions, renovations, and new developments, and we're currently renovating Blakely Hall, which will provide another 120 undergraduate beds on campus.

164
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:22,718
[SPEAKER_30]: All freshmen and sophomores are required to live on campus.

165
00:13:23,378 --> 00:13:26,919
[SPEAKER_30]: And we also house more than 300 juniors and seniors on campus.

166
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:34,861
[SPEAKER_30]: And we feel it's in the best interest of both the university and the city to house more juniors and seniors on campus.

167
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:39,802
[SPEAKER_30]: And this project will help us accomplish that goal by housing 677 juniors and seniors on campus.

168
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:51,020
[SPEAKER_30]: Providing more on-campus housing opportunities for our students is essential to our mission as a university.

169
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,962
[SPEAKER_30]: But more importantly, it also frees up apartments off campus for working families in Medford.

170
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,105
[SPEAKER_30]: We picked this particular location for a variety of reasons.

171
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:05,347
[SPEAKER_30]: We wanted to make sure that the project was on campus, which this is.

172
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:14,470
[SPEAKER_30]: that it was adjacent to mass transit, and that it provided us with an opportunity to add more retail opportunities for Boston Avenue.

173
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,951
[SPEAKER_30]: This project will provide much needed public realm improvements on Boston Avenue.

174
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:30,394
[SPEAKER_30]: As part of this project, Tufts University will be adding new sidewalks to Boston Avenue, new crosswalks, new trees, a blue bike station, and new retail options.

175
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:35,595
[SPEAKER_30]: This project will make Boston Avenue greener, more walkable, and more accessible.

176
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:46,177
[SPEAKER_30]: We've spent the last 4 months meeting with neighbors, elected officials, city department heads, and other key stakeholders, and we've received a lot of feedback during those meetings.

177
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:50,800
[SPEAKER_30]: And we've tried to incorporate many of those requests into this project.

178
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:57,302
[SPEAKER_30]: I am joined tonight by Barb Stein, who's our vice president of operations at Tufts University.

179
00:14:58,802 --> 00:15:03,285
[SPEAKER_30]: And what I would like to do now is introduce Walker May from Capstone.

180
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:09,208
[SPEAKER_30]: When Tufts decided to do this housing project, we did a nationwide search.

181
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:16,077
[SPEAKER_30]: to try to find someone who's an expert in developing these housing projects.

182
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:21,104
[SPEAKER_30]: We're delighted that we were able to find Capstone and work with them.

183
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:25,170
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm now going to turn it over to Walker May from Capstone.

184
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:27,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Rocco.

185
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:34,426
[SPEAKER_04]: The Capstone companies started in 1990 and have been focused solely on student housing development and operations ever since.

186
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:53,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Capstone Development Partners, the successor company to Capstone Development Corp, is a private principal-led company that was formed in 2011 and has been focused almost entirely in on-campus student housing and related facility development, partnering with over 70 universities to deliver over 50,000 beds and 3.3 billion in total development cost.

187
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:59,534
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been awarded Student Housing Project of the Year seven times and five projects awarded Best P3.

188
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:18,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And when Capstone was invited to participate in the competitive procurement to become Tufts Development Operational Partner, we quickly put together a team of local design build specialists, and that includes Elcas Manfredi Architects, represented tonight by David Manfredi, Erland Construction, represented by Eric Green,

189
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:32,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Niche Engineering is our civil engineer represented by Jonathan Hedlund and Crowley Cottrell Landscape Architects represented by Michelle Crowley, and then our local council, Golston and Storrs, represented tonight by Pat Gallagher.

190
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:44,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Most recently, Capstone has also been working with Tufts and the finance team to evaluate and select the most appropriate finance structure for the project, as well as the best non-profit owner for the project, which we have done over these last couple of weeks.

191
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:50,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So I look forward to presenting the project here to the board and to the community.

192
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, I'm going to turn it over to David Manfredi, who's going to walk you through our current design plans.

193
00:16:56,478 --> 00:17:00,164
[SPEAKER_04]: David, or I guess maybe Rocco, you're going to speak to the schedule first.

194
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:06,568
[SPEAKER_30]: I was just gonna say, if we can just speak to the schedule really quickly, just to update folks on what we've done so far.

195
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:11,810
[SPEAKER_30]: We began having pre submittal meetings with the city of Medford in August.

196
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,633
[SPEAKER_30]: We had an initial meeting with department heads in September.

197
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:25,597
[SPEAKER_30]: We did our 1st community meeting, which was a virtual zoom meeting on September 26 and that was very well attended.

198
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:31,759
[SPEAKER_30]: In October, we continue doing follow up meetings with the, with individual department heads.

199
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,961
[SPEAKER_30]: On October 28th, we had our 2nd community meeting.

200
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:41,884
[SPEAKER_30]: This 1 was in person and in November, we continue doing additional meetings with.

201
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:45,186
[SPEAKER_30]: individual City of Medford department heads.

202
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:56,613
[SPEAKER_30]: We've also been meeting one-on-one with neighbors, local business owners, key stakeholders, and really anyone else who is interested in the project.

203
00:17:58,114 --> 00:18:04,478
[SPEAKER_30]: We're here tonight on November 20th in front of the Community Development Board seeking site plan approval.

204
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:11,502
[SPEAKER_30]: It's now my pleasure to turn it over to David Manfredi, our architect on this project.

205
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:15,018
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, everybody.

206
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:19,104
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm David Manfredi from Elkis Manfredi Architects in Boston.

207
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:22,470
[SPEAKER_23]: And we are the Project Architects.

208
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:25,795
[SPEAKER_23]: If you could go to the next, please, Ross.

209
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:33,544
[SPEAKER_23]: So we'll start on the site, and I suspect that everybody on this Zoom knows this site.

210
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,747
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see it outlined in blue.

211
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:44,838
[SPEAKER_23]: It is about halfway on the south side of Boston Avenue, about halfway between College Avenue and Winthrop Street or University.

212
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:50,280
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can see it's a long linear site parallel to Boston Avenue.

213
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,141
[SPEAKER_23]: It is surface parking today.

214
00:18:52,161 --> 00:19:03,523
[SPEAKER_23]: It is the beginning or the toe of that steep hill that goes up to the residential quad and up to the center of campus.

215
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:14,986
[SPEAKER_23]: It's used today as surface parking and really underutilized on this important site as surface parking.

216
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:19,392
[SPEAKER_23]: You can also see in our diagram obviously the importance of

217
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:25,473
[SPEAKER_23]: Boston Avenue and of College Ave, and of Winthrop Street as well.

218
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:29,734
[SPEAKER_23]: And then the dash lines really represent pedestrian paths.

219
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:49,878
[SPEAKER_23]: And through Dowling Hall, which is the parking structure up to the top of the hill, and the stair on the west side of Dowling, and several different paths that come up at University Ave, that come up through the residential buildings of Tufts University.

220
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:52,067
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the next...

221
00:19:54,065 --> 00:20:04,868
[SPEAKER_23]: And so here's a site plan, and there's been some important modifications to this since some of you have seen this in earlier public meetings.

222
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:11,910
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, Boston Avenue is on the top of the page, University Ave to the left, and Dowling Hall to the right.

223
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:19,032
[SPEAKER_23]: And you're looking where it says East Building and West Building, you're looking at the footprints of the two proposed buildings.

224
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:20,593
[SPEAKER_23]: And it is two buildings.

225
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:27,237
[SPEAKER_23]: They are separated not quite in the middle by a stair that's open to the sky.

226
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:34,401
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the beginning of the walk up the hill that brings you to the top of campus.

227
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:42,466
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see that the east building looks like it has hardscape, meaning sidewalk, on Boston Avenue.

228
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:43,707
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's correct.

229
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:47,610
[SPEAKER_23]: It basically, first floor is basically at grade.

230
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,851
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you look at the west building, you can see there's some green against the building and then sidewalk.

231
00:20:54,491 --> 00:21:09,454
[SPEAKER_23]: And that this building is a little bit higher, especially where you get to the green space, a little bit higher on the grade, because our goal is to fit the buildings into the slope of the hill, as opposed to a significant amount of excavation.

232
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:11,095
[SPEAKER_23]: That's obviously

233
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:17,811
[SPEAKER_23]: Lighter construction, less of the heavy earthwork kind of construction.

234
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:29,898
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's also good sustainability, meaning that you don't expend a lot of energy to move earth around, but build buildings.

235
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:33,639
[SPEAKER_23]: that accommodate the earth as it exists.

236
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:44,264
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, I mentioned that there was some new ideas here, and you'll notice that on the south side of Boston Avenue, we are showing a continuous row of street trees.

237
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:50,606
[SPEAKER_23]: And on the north side, we're also showing a row, a continuous row of street trees that are smaller.

238
00:21:51,306 --> 00:21:57,609
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, in order to achieve that, there's a number of, several things have to happen.

239
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:04,560
[SPEAKER_23]: We need approval from the MBTA to plant trees on the north side of the street.

240
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:11,424
[SPEAKER_23]: The MBTA, of course, concerned about limbs falling onto tracks and disturbing the service.

241
00:22:11,904 --> 00:22:14,846
[SPEAKER_23]: And so it does require their approvals.

242
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:23,031
[SPEAKER_23]: It would require lower trees that fit underneath the power lines above.

243
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:27,594
[SPEAKER_23]: MBTA requirement, but that's a utility requirement.

244
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:36,957
[SPEAKER_23]: And on the south side of the street, it would require the relocation of those overhead utilities in order to accommodate those trees.

245
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:50,663
[SPEAKER_23]: We know that the trees are important to the neighbors to the north, but they're also important to creating really good sidewalks and what we call complete streets, meaning streets that have sidewalks and a planting zone,

246
00:22:51,503 --> 00:23:03,875
[SPEAKER_23]: that create shade in the summertime, but also just create more green in an environment along a relatively wide street that is a lot of hardscape.

247
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:14,939
[SPEAKER_23]: The other thing I'll point out here is that you'll notice that right below where it says West Building, you see some dark gray.

248
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,041
[SPEAKER_23]: That's service.

249
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,043
[SPEAKER_23]: It exists today.

250
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:21,585
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll get kind of

251
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:26,847
[SPEAKER_23]: reconfigured in order to accommodate service to these buildings.

252
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:38,374
[SPEAKER_23]: All the service to these buildings, well, all the service to the West building will be from the South side of the building, as well as some of the service to the East building.

253
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:44,778
[SPEAKER_23]: There'll also be service in that passageway between the East building and Dowling Hall.

254
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:47,120
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the next please.

255
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:54,113
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm not going to read this whole list, but I do want to point out the bold letters.

256
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:58,120
[SPEAKER_23]: And these are the public realm improvements.

257
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,384
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, you can see the footprints of the two buildings.

258
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:05,643
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see the numbers in blue, and the numbers in blue correspond to the items below.

259
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:22,787
[SPEAKER_23]: And the biggest one is really what Rocco introduced at the very beginning, that the project provides on-campus housing for approximately 677 upperclassmen at Tufts, which, of course, takes students out of the neighborhoods.

260
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:33,656
[SPEAKER_23]: hopefully will have the long-term effect of, even short-term effect of, reducing rent pressure and reducing traffic.

261
00:24:34,077 --> 00:24:35,658
[SPEAKER_23]: Students are living on campus.

262
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:39,181
[SPEAKER_23]: There's less movement on and off campus.

263
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:41,102
[SPEAKER_23]: Second is improved accessibility.

264
00:24:41,443 --> 00:24:45,386
[SPEAKER_23]: And what we mean by that is sidewalks, better sidewalks,

265
00:24:47,468 --> 00:25:01,998
[SPEAKER_23]: On both sides of the street as we're showing here, if we have the permission to do that additional fire hydrants and that's number three and you can see on the south side of the street, new fire hydrants at the east building and new fire hydrant.

266
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:04,733
[SPEAKER_23]: at the entrance to the West Building.

267
00:25:05,694 --> 00:25:18,436
[SPEAKER_23]: Fully enclosed trash and recycling rooms inside the building, so no trash is left outside, no trash from food that attracts rodents, all will be kept inside the building.

268
00:25:19,536 --> 00:25:26,197
[SPEAKER_23]: Reduced light emittance, and I know this is an important one, a community comment that we have heard.

269
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:30,038
[SPEAKER_23]: There'll be operable shades in all rooms, but maybe

270
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:35,579
[SPEAKER_23]: The most important thing is that this is a passive house building.

271
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:45,841
[SPEAKER_23]: That means that the amount of glazing, the amount of glass in windows is less than, is about 30% of the total surface area of the building.

272
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:49,862
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's not like a curtain wall building where there's a lot of glass.

273
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:51,102
[SPEAKER_23]: It's less than 30%.

274
00:25:51,822 --> 00:25:56,923
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that will obviously significantly reduce light emittance.

275
00:25:58,163 --> 00:26:07,566
[SPEAKER_23]: There are no amenity and student activity spaces above the first two levels so that that kind of activity only exists on the lower part of the building.

276
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:14,228
[SPEAKER_23]: There will be new crosswalks on Boston Avenue and University Avenue and again the wider sidewalks.

277
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:23,050
[SPEAKER_23]: There's retail space on the east side of the east building and that sidewalk is wide enough to accommodate cafe tables

278
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:26,574
[SPEAKER_23]: and some outdoor seating for food and beverage.

279
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:31,335
[SPEAKER_23]: There'll be a dedicated rideshare pickup and drop-off zone on Boston Avenue.

280
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:34,496
[SPEAKER_23]: I mentioned the new trees on the south sidewalk.

281
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:46,160
[SPEAKER_23]: The capstone is in conversations with National Grid and the MBTA because that will require moving power lines.

282
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,602
[SPEAKER_23]: New sidewalks and tree screening on the north sidewalk again with the

283
00:26:52,622 --> 00:26:55,483
[SPEAKER_23]: approval of the MBTA.

284
00:26:56,223 --> 00:27:08,988
[SPEAKER_23]: And as I mentioned, passive house construction, what that really means is that these will, these buildings will be very airtight and heavily insulated to produce the most sustainable buildings possible.

285
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:12,409
[SPEAKER_23]: These are all electric buildings, there's no fossil fuels.

286
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:16,350
[SPEAKER_23]: And it also means that they are

287
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:23,714
[SPEAKER_23]: That insulation also provides protection, acoustic protection inside out.

288
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:35,048
[SPEAKER_23]: There's available parking for retail visitors on the street along the south side of Boston Ave, and we will accommodate a new blue bike station on Boston Ave.

289
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:36,724
[SPEAKER_23]: Next please.

290
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:43,234
[SPEAKER_23]: So, 2 buildings, the East building is smaller than the West building.

291
00:27:43,715 --> 00:27:45,998
[SPEAKER_23]: These building is 265 beds.

292
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,302
[SPEAKER_23]: The West building is up 412 beds for a total of 677.

293
00:27:52,251 --> 00:28:01,361
[SPEAKER_23]: And what's really important, and you'll see it when we get to our plans, is, again, this is for juniors and seniors.

294
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:03,123
[SPEAKER_23]: These are apartments.

295
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:11,153
[SPEAKER_23]: And so it's a much more typical kind of dwelling unit.

296
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:13,875
[SPEAKER_23]: living accommodation.

297
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:15,596
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's go to the next place.

298
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:25,342
[SPEAKER_23]: So the plans are a little bit hard to understand because of the fact that we are building into the earth.

299
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:32,906
[SPEAKER_23]: So what you're seeing in color is the footprint at the elevation of the sidewalk.

300
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,288
[SPEAKER_23]: And what you're seeing in very dark gray

301
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,168
[SPEAKER_23]: is earth.

302
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:38,429
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the hill.

303
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:51,874
[SPEAKER_23]: And so when we draw a plan, it's as if we cut off the building four feet above ground and we're showing you that area in color and those uses, but then we're cutting into the earth.

304
00:28:51,974 --> 00:28:53,814
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that's everything that's in dark gray.

305
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:57,996
[SPEAKER_23]: So you see in the building, the building on the right is the east building.

306
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:01,257
[SPEAKER_23]: You see the little yellow box, that's the entry.

307
00:29:01,837 --> 00:29:08,323
[SPEAKER_23]: It's at elevation 59, and you can see both buildings right and left are at elevation 59.

308
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:17,332
[SPEAKER_23]: Everything in purple is lobby, amenity space, it's waiting space for an Uber or somebody to pick you up.

309
00:29:18,413 --> 00:29:20,895
[SPEAKER_23]: It's social space.

310
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:28,640
[SPEAKER_23]: It is access, and you can see where the two little red arrows are, it's access to elevators to go up the building.

311
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:37,684
[SPEAKER_23]: There's also, Capstone will have offices here, and you can see in gray there's a men's and women's room.

312
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:51,812
[SPEAKER_23]: The pink is retail, and by retail we mean third-party retail, retail that is open, accessible to everybody, to the neighborhood, likely to be food and beverage, but it may well be a mix.

313
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:56,976
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, you go to the West building, you can see it has a very small amount of color.

314
00:29:57,457 --> 00:30:08,608
[SPEAKER_23]: That's because there's a very small amount of first floor here, and that is simply to get in the door, to get a lobby, to get an elevator lobby, to get a little bit of

315
00:30:09,328 --> 00:30:36,072
[SPEAKER_23]: of back-of-house utility space, but the real first floor is a level up because, again, we don't want to excavate that hill for a variety of reasons, but not excavating means you're accelerating construction and you're eliminating some of the most annoying parts of any kind of urban construction.

316
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,076
[SPEAKER_23]: Go to the next one, please, Ross.

317
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:44,240
[SPEAKER_23]: So now I've gone up one level on the west building.

318
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:53,666
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can see that everything in purple, again, is common spaces for students, social spaces, it's study spaces, it's fitness, it's laundry.

319
00:30:54,187 --> 00:31:01,492
[SPEAKER_23]: And then you can begin to see just to the left, the actual apartments.

320
00:31:01,712 --> 00:31:06,155
[SPEAKER_23]: And the colors simply mean their designations for the orange

321
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,326
[SPEAKER_23]: are one-bedroom units.

322
00:31:09,406 --> 00:31:12,287
[SPEAKER_23]: The yellow are four-bedroom units.

323
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:21,509
[SPEAKER_23]: There are some six-bedroom units in the east building, but in this building, four bedrooms is the biggest.

324
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:28,211
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can also see that gray area where I had pointed out the service drive.

325
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:34,473
[SPEAKER_23]: That's how we'll access the building for trash, for service to mechanical and electrical equipment.

326
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:46,033
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can also enter the building, if you're coming down from campus, you're coming down the hill, you can enter the building on that second level, on both sides, both buildings.

327
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:51,338
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is the level two plan, and you can see the west building is all apartments.

328
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:54,921
[SPEAKER_23]: It's all one bedrooms, two bedrooms, and four bedrooms.

329
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:59,164
[SPEAKER_23]: On the east side, this is really the second floor now of the building.

330
00:31:59,624 --> 00:32:02,787
[SPEAKER_23]: And so again, you have the yellow and the orange, those are apartments.

331
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,271
[SPEAKER_23]: The purple is amenity space.

332
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:07,312
[SPEAKER_23]: That means social space, study spaces.

333
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:12,296
[SPEAKER_23]: You also see some CMP means capstone management.

334
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:16,258
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that's some of their utility spaces.

335
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:22,242
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, you can see the elevator lobbies that take you up the building.

336
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,229
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the next, this is a typical floor.

337
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:27,910
[SPEAKER_23]: So these are floors three through eight.

338
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,650
[SPEAKER_23]: They all look the same.

339
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:36,913
[SPEAKER_23]: The white is the core, meaning the elevators, the corridors, and then the yellow and the different.

340
00:32:39,194 --> 00:32:45,276
[SPEAKER_23]: The orange just mean the difference between one bedrooms and two bedrooms and four bedroom apartments.

341
00:32:47,782 --> 00:32:54,206
[SPEAKER_23]: I should have pointed out, if you look all the way to the right, you can see a six-bedroom apartment that's up against Dowling.

342
00:32:54,747 --> 00:33:00,671
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the only six-bedroom on each floor, and it stacks up on that east side of the East Building.

343
00:33:02,932 --> 00:33:03,533
[SPEAKER_23]: Go to the next.

344
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:10,818
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, and so important in 9 and 10, you can see that the building steps back.

345
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:18,243
[SPEAKER_23]: So where it says level 8 roof, the building steps back away from University.

346
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:22,206
[SPEAKER_23]: The floor plate gets smaller in the West building on floors 9 and 10.

347
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:25,188
[SPEAKER_23]: If we go to the next.

348
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:28,251
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, I wanted to show you this section.

349
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:31,909
[SPEAKER_23]: because this is a very steep hill.

350
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:40,094
[SPEAKER_23]: So when we say section, what we mean is we're cutting through the building and we're cutting through the earth below the building.

351
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:49,881
[SPEAKER_23]: So just like in plant, the dark gray represents earth and then everything above it, the trees, that's the existing topography.

352
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:54,824
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see all the way to the left, the Cummings Center, the Green Line and Boston Avenue.

353
00:33:55,297 --> 00:33:59,161
[SPEAKER_23]: And then the building, and we're cutting through the east building here.

354
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:00,902
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see it's 10 stories.

355
00:34:00,962 --> 00:34:03,525
[SPEAKER_23]: The first floor is all common spaces.

356
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:06,688
[SPEAKER_23]: Floors two through 10 are all apartments.

357
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:12,053
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can see the building's 107 feet tall from grade, from Boston Avenue.

358
00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:19,398
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, the reason we showed the 125-foot height is that's the allowable height, so we're below the allowable.

359
00:34:19,939 --> 00:34:30,924
[SPEAKER_23]: We also wanted to show, though, where the top of the building is relative to the top of the hill, to the residential quad, Ben Denson Hall, is at elevation 140.

360
00:34:30,984 --> 00:34:39,228
[SPEAKER_23]: And so from the top of the hill, you're basically seeing two stories of building, or at least

361
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:43,256
[SPEAKER_23]: until you get closer and start walking down the hill.

362
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:48,847
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously from the north side, you're seeing a 10-story building, and I'll show you that in just a moment.

363
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:50,431
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the next.

364
00:34:52,043 --> 00:34:54,425
[SPEAKER_23]: So we've got a series of perspectives here.

365
00:34:54,906 --> 00:35:08,478
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the existing site, and call your attention to the sidewalks, which are not in great condition, both on the north side and on the south side of Boston Avenue.

366
00:35:08,498 --> 00:35:09,819
[SPEAKER_23]: You also see in the upper right

367
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,761
[SPEAKER_23]: that very steep slope.

368
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:21,247
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's the steep slope that we want to excavate as little as possible, because that's earthwork.

369
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:29,153
[SPEAKER_23]: It takes time, and it's probably the messiest part of a construction project.

370
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:33,415
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're going to minimize that as much as possible.

371
00:35:33,796 --> 00:35:38,639
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can see lower left, existing surface parking lots, all pervious.

372
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:45,384
[SPEAKER_23]: And really not a well-utilized piece of property.

373
00:35:46,225 --> 00:35:47,006
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the next.

374
00:35:48,088 --> 00:35:53,674
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm going to show you a photograph of the existing and then from the same view, a rendering.

375
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:58,200
[SPEAKER_23]: And so this is Boston Avenue looking west.

376
00:35:59,162 --> 00:36:14,075
[SPEAKER_23]: That's Dowling Hall to the left, the stair that goes up the hill, the building, and you can see the, this is the east end of the east building, so that's retail, there's about 4200 square feet, you know, probably two or three shops.

377
00:36:14,795 --> 00:36:18,599
[SPEAKER_23]: maybe food and beverage, may have some outdoor seating.

378
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,341
[SPEAKER_23]: You'll see that a little bit more up close in a moment.

379
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:36,914
[SPEAKER_23]: The buildings are clad in brick, largely in brick, and they have a kind of two-story base, meaning a darker color brick and then a kind of buff colored brick above on the east building and on the west building, a red brick above.

380
00:36:38,055 --> 00:36:38,956
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the next,

381
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:51,747
[SPEAKER_23]: And so this is on the sidewalk, you can see street trees pending approval and wide sidewalks and a little bit of outdoor seating.

382
00:36:52,587 --> 00:37:01,850
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see spilling out from the building and you can see the entrances and the darker brick on the lower levels.

383
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:12,756
[SPEAKER_23]: Now I'm looking southeast, and to the left is obviously Boston Ave.

384
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:14,938
[SPEAKER_23]: Climbing up the hill is University.

385
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:16,659
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is the corner.

386
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:19,562
[SPEAKER_23]: That intersection will stay the way it is.

387
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:28,910
[SPEAKER_23]: And we'll be using that service drive as you go up University and turn left into that service drive.

388
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,833
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can see the above grade power lines in that photograph.

389
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:50,734
[SPEAKER_23]: Now that you see the building, and this is the West building, red brick, 10 stories tall, stepping down to 8 stories tall, street trees along the building side and street trees on the rail side.

390
00:37:51,914 --> 00:38:00,159
[SPEAKER_23]: But you can see those street trees are lower to be under the relocated power lines if we get permission to do that.

391
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:02,484
[SPEAKER_23]: if you go to the next.

392
00:38:03,085 --> 00:38:04,446
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is a longer view.

393
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:16,479
[SPEAKER_23]: You all know that retail, the food and beverage on the left, and the houses on the right that are just west of University.

394
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,382
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can see the building beyond.

395
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:23,187
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the eighth story on University and then stepping up to 10 stories.

396
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:29,129
[SPEAKER_23]: And the next, and now this is a view that I mentioned.

397
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:31,230
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the view from Brookings Street.

398
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,771
[SPEAKER_23]: That's actually a photograph that we took last summer.

399
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:44,255
[SPEAKER_23]: So the leaves are still all on the trees, but those are the real trees and with all of their foliage on them.

400
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:52,059
[SPEAKER_23]: And then you can see you're looking straight on the West building, but you can see both buildings in this photograph.

401
00:38:55,188 --> 00:39:01,449
[SPEAKER_23]: And this view gives you everything, meaning you can see the campus.

402
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:07,270
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see the residential quad and the president's lawn beyond.

403
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:14,232
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see the proposed building kind of three quarters of the way to the left in the middle.

404
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:20,293
[SPEAKER_23]: The two buildings, the lighter colored buff brick building, and then the red brick building.

405
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:32,389
[SPEAKER_23]: and mostly obscured is Boston Ave, but you can just see it there, University, and obviously the upper right corner you see, at this height, you see all the way to downtown Boston.

406
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:43,716
[SPEAKER_23]: One more view from, this is from Boston Avenue looking south, kind of southwest.

407
00:39:44,677 --> 00:39:47,719
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see Boston Avenue and the rail lines,

408
00:39:48,463 --> 00:40:03,261
[SPEAKER_23]: and downtown Boston beyond, you can see Dowling, a little bit left of center, and then first the East Building, the space between the two buildings, and then the West Building, and all the way over here to the right is University Ave.

409
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:07,721
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that's oh, no, that's not my last slide.

410
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:13,567
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to talk a little bit about sustainability because these will be highly sustainable buildings.

411
00:40:14,307 --> 00:40:17,991
[SPEAKER_23]: And probably the most important thing is they will be fossil free buildings.

412
00:40:18,031 --> 00:40:19,572
[SPEAKER_23]: They will be all electric.

413
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:25,158
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously, the benefit of public transit with the green line.

414
00:40:26,512 --> 00:40:33,199
[SPEAKER_23]: At Cummings Center, we'll have bicycle storage and bicycle amenities that encourage bicycle use.

415
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:45,271
[SPEAKER_23]: Recycling, construction waste management, which is all about create as little construction waste as possible and then recycle as much of it as possible.

416
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:47,774
[SPEAKER_23]: All the plantings will be drought tolerant.

417
00:40:48,436 --> 00:40:50,237
[SPEAKER_23]: We're having a very, very dry fall.

418
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:55,039
[SPEAKER_23]: And the air handling will be energy recovery.

419
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,781
[SPEAKER_23]: So we want to use as little energy as possible.

420
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:01,282
[SPEAKER_23]: And obviously, we want to

421
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:13,175
[SPEAKER_23]: create, use less, consume less energy and use less power to power the building.

422
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:18,997
[SPEAKER_23]: Highly efficient lights and appliances, heat pump technology for heating and cooling.

423
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:21,378
[SPEAKER_23]: So I said it would be passive house, which means

424
00:41:22,078 --> 00:41:26,500
[SPEAKER_23]: a very air-type building envelope, very little infiltration.

425
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:36,303
[SPEAKER_23]: And to get certified as passive house, you have to provide high-performance windows and doors, which are good for energy, but also good for sound.

426
00:41:37,284 --> 00:41:40,765
[SPEAKER_23]: Keep sound in the building and not out.

427
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:48,268
[SPEAKER_23]: And the next, I think, goes to Eric Green to talk

428
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,603
[SPEAKER_29]: Eric has his hand raised.

429
00:41:56,623 --> 00:41:58,264
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it used to be unmuted.

430
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:01,607
[SPEAKER_29]: It's Eric Green.

431
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:04,029
[SPEAKER_42]: Yep.

432
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:04,850
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, David.

433
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:05,910
[SPEAKER_42]: Good evening, everyone.

434
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,672
[SPEAKER_42]: My name is Eric Green.

435
00:42:07,712 --> 00:42:10,194
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm with Erland Construction, and we're based in Burlington.

436
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,098
[SPEAKER_42]: What's on the screen is our site utilization plan, how we plan to manage the site.

437
00:42:15,918 --> 00:42:21,823
[SPEAKER_42]: You can see the kind of purple perimeter fencing area around the site.

438
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:24,093
[SPEAKER_42]: Uh, that fence will be a full time.

439
00:42:24,153 --> 00:42:27,095
[SPEAKER_42]: Obviously we'll have full time on site supervision.

440
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:33,080
[SPEAKER_42]: Uh, we do plan on taking the parking lane closest to the building along Boston Avenue.

441
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,604
[SPEAKER_42]: And the purpose of that is so that we can get trucks into the site and out of this site without having to back up.

442
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:44,728
[SPEAKER_42]: It makes for a good truck path, uh, to the, uh, to the buck hoist locations into the tower cranes.

443
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:49,752
[SPEAKER_42]: Uh, Tufts has committed to allowing our workers to park on campus.

444
00:42:50,403 --> 00:42:56,067
[SPEAKER_42]: so the construction workers will not be parking on the streets or in the neighborhoods, which is a big plus for the project.

445
00:42:57,228 --> 00:43:05,814
[SPEAKER_42]: This will be submitted along with a lot of other information in the form of a construction management plan to the city for their review and approval.

446
00:43:06,654 --> 00:43:17,322
[SPEAKER_42]: We have already reached out to Bono Pest Control, who does the pest control currently for Tufts, and they've prepared an integrated pest management plan, which is part of the construction management plan.

447
00:43:18,011 --> 00:43:25,517
[SPEAKER_42]: I know there was some concern from residents at past meetings about rats and other pests.

448
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:32,483
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have a pest management plan that we'll review with the city and make sure that's acceptable, and we'll follow that as the project goes along.

449
00:43:33,624 --> 00:43:40,990
[SPEAKER_42]: The bidding period for the project, for anyone that's interested, whether you know subcontractors that might have an interest, it looks like it's January.

450
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,553
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't have an exact date yet, but it'll probably be the month of January.

451
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:51,461
[SPEAKER_42]: And right now, construction time frame is approximately April 1st of 2025 to late July of 2027.

452
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:56,564
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's a little bit about how we plan on managing the site.

453
00:43:58,966 --> 00:44:02,409
[SPEAKER_42]: I think next up is maybe Ross or David.

454
00:44:09,394 --> 00:44:09,994
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Eric.

455
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:12,376
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm back to talk about shadows.

456
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:21,709
[SPEAKER_23]: some of you have seen our shadow studies before, but before we actually get to the shadows, I just want to remind people of sun path.

457
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:28,991
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you look at the diagram on the left, you can see in the kind of orange color, the two proposed buildings.

458
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:37,113
[SPEAKER_23]: And what we're trying to show is the arc of the sun at

459
00:44:37,998 --> 00:44:54,753
[SPEAKER_23]: during the hours of the day, and obviously the sun rises in the east, you can see 6 a.m., and rises to its zenith at noon, and then continues to come down and set in the west.

460
00:44:55,494 --> 00:45:02,540
[SPEAKER_23]: And what you all know is that in the summertime, the sun is very high,

461
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:11,280
[SPEAKER_23]: and that the arc that's the closest to being kind of just a big loop over at the center of the sphere.

462
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:18,165
[SPEAKER_23]: So in the summer, the sun at noon is at about 74 degrees from horizontal.

463
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:22,467
[SPEAKER_23]: So buildings cast the smallest shadow they will cast all year long.

464
00:45:23,008 --> 00:45:26,110
[SPEAKER_23]: The winter solstice, the sun is lower all day long.

465
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,572
[SPEAKER_23]: It's at the bottom in the right hand, it's the bottom.

466
00:45:30,378 --> 00:45:32,659
[SPEAKER_23]: of those series of concentric circles.

467
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:38,440
[SPEAKER_23]: And so the shadows are longer in the winter and the sun sets at 420.

468
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,301
[SPEAKER_23]: It's coming up soon on December 21st.

469
00:45:43,021 --> 00:45:49,743
[SPEAKER_23]: So you have longer shadows and of course a much shorter day.

470
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:55,184
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the next, we'll show you the shadows at the

471
00:45:56,075 --> 00:46:00,918
[SPEAKER_23]: at the four key times of the day.

472
00:46:01,198 --> 00:46:11,604
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's 9 o'clock in the morning, 12 noon, 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and then here we're showing it at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

473
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:20,349
[SPEAKER_23]: And we'll show it at the four key days, which are spring and fall equinox, and then the winter and summer solstice.

474
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:23,090
[SPEAKER_23]: So on March 21st,

475
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:25,672
[SPEAKER_23]: the spring equinox.

476
00:46:26,072 --> 00:46:29,414
[SPEAKER_23]: The sun rises at 645, it sets at 658.

477
00:46:30,395 --> 00:46:39,681
[SPEAKER_23]: If you look at the upper left, you can see that, of course, the sun comes up in the east, and the orange is the building footprint.

478
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:48,506
[SPEAKER_23]: The purple is net new shadow, meaning there's no shadow on the ground or on building roofs.

479
00:46:50,617 --> 00:46:58,202
[SPEAKER_23]: unless you see purple or lavender, that's net new shadow caused by the buildings.

480
00:46:58,723 --> 00:47:01,744
[SPEAKER_23]: Any darker gray you see is shadow that already exists.

481
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:09,329
[SPEAKER_23]: So now, so we go from nine o'clock in the morning, oops, go back one please, you went too fast for me.

482
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:10,910
[SPEAKER_23]: You say you see

483
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:17,859
[SPEAKER_23]: you see a shadow on the hillside on the Tufts campus side.

484
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:24,621
[SPEAKER_23]: By 12 noon, the shadow is now on the south sidewalk of Boston Ave.

485
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:32,423
[SPEAKER_23]: By 3 in the afternoon, the shadow is really across the street to the North Curb.

486
00:47:33,023 --> 00:47:41,845
[SPEAKER_23]: And then by 4 in the afternoon, it hasn't reached any houses, but it's probably on the rail tracks at that point.

487
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:49,802
[SPEAKER_23]: So now if you go to the next one, you can see we've extended this from the last time.

488
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,073
[SPEAKER_23]: We showed it so you could see it at 4, 5, and 6.

489
00:47:53,593 --> 00:47:59,215
[SPEAKER_23]: So at 5 o'clock, sun is setting on March 21, starting to set.

490
00:48:00,576 --> 00:48:06,838
[SPEAKER_23]: And so you can see it stretching and just hitting a few of those houses closest to Boston Ave.

491
00:48:07,278 --> 00:48:10,539
[SPEAKER_23]: And then by 6 o'clock, the sun is setting.

492
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:11,039
[SPEAKER_23]: It sets at 658.

493
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,480
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can see some shadow on the ground.

494
00:48:15,441 --> 00:48:19,202
[SPEAKER_23]: And all the dark gray around it is all the existing shadow.

495
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:21,910
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the next.

496
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,331
[SPEAKER_23]: So now I'm going to go to the summer solstice.

497
00:48:25,411 --> 00:48:38,333
[SPEAKER_23]: So June 21 and sun's very high comes up and comes up early in the morning at 508 shadows on the campus side of the buildings at 12 noon.

498
00:48:38,593 --> 00:48:43,274
[SPEAKER_23]: There's almost no shadow because the sun is so high in the sky.

499
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:45,575
[SPEAKER_23]: And so it's a little bit of shadow.

500
00:48:45,595 --> 00:48:46,935
[SPEAKER_23]: You can see just a little

501
00:48:47,775 --> 00:48:51,299
[SPEAKER_23]: little tint of lavender.

502
00:48:52,241 --> 00:49:01,412
[SPEAKER_23]: And then by three in the afternoon there's shadow on the south side of Boston Ave and by six o'clock there's shadow on Boston Ave but hasn't even reached

503
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:06,146
[SPEAKER_23]: the backyards of those houses, because the sun is so, so high.

504
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:23,810
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the next, you can see at 7 and at 8, the shadow does cross Boston Ave, and then at 8 o'clock, because the sun sets so far into the west and the northwest, the sun actually is over at Cummings Center.

505
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,051
[SPEAKER_23]: The shadow, I mean, is at Cummings Center.

506
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:28,071
[SPEAKER_23]: Go to the next.

507
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,652
[SPEAKER_23]: And now I'm on September 21st, the fall equinox.

508
00:49:33,213 --> 00:49:37,076
[SPEAKER_23]: The spring and the fall are basically the same, not exactly, but almost the same.

509
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:42,239
[SPEAKER_23]: Nine o'clock in the morning, the shadow's on the campus side.

510
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,601
[SPEAKER_23]: At noon, it's on the sidewalk.

511
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:49,825
[SPEAKER_23]: At three in the afternoon, it hasn't quite crossed the street or barely crossing the street.

512
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:55,309
[SPEAKER_23]: At four o'clock in the afternoon, it has crossed the street, hasn't reached any houses yet.

513
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,911
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you go to the next, you can see at five,

514
00:50:00,746 --> 00:50:04,589
[SPEAKER_23]: It does cross the street and into the neighborhood.

515
00:50:04,649 --> 00:50:13,235
[SPEAKER_23]: And then if you look all the way to the right at six o'clock, you've got some shadow on top of the Tufts athletic buildings.

516
00:50:13,936 --> 00:50:16,117
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what we're showing in that purple.

517
00:50:17,558 --> 00:50:19,119
[SPEAKER_23]: And now the last one is December 21st.

518
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:26,486
[SPEAKER_23]: The very, very low sun, so the very longest shadows for any building for your house or any building.

519
00:50:26,947 --> 00:50:31,515
[SPEAKER_23]: So you can see at 9 o'clock in the morning, the sun comes up at 7 o'clock, 710.

520
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:42,618
[SPEAKER_23]: but it actually comes up much further south than it did on June 21st, and so the shadow is cast more to the north.

521
00:50:43,218 --> 00:50:46,459
[SPEAKER_23]: By 12 o'clock, the shadow is on Boston Ave.

522
00:50:46,499 --> 00:50:50,960
[SPEAKER_23]: By one o'clock, it has just reaching some houses.

523
00:50:51,020 --> 00:51:02,264
[SPEAKER_23]: At two o'clock, you can see shadow, but you can also see that there's a lot of existing shadow because you've got a low sun, so even low buildings cast shadows.

524
00:51:03,504 --> 00:51:08,389
[SPEAKER_23]: If you go to the next one, you can see you'll follow through to 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

525
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:11,672
[SPEAKER_23]: We stop at 3 because the sun has gone by 4.15.

526
00:51:13,313 --> 00:51:14,835
[SPEAKER_23]: But you can see some purple there.

527
00:51:16,336 --> 00:51:24,624
[SPEAKER_23]: And you can see there's no purple typically in the streets because the streets are already in shadow from the houses that are there.

528
00:51:28,823 --> 00:51:31,665
[SPEAKER_23]: And that is the end of our presentation.

529
00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:33,286
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for your attention.

530
00:51:34,867 --> 00:51:36,068
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, David.

531
00:51:36,148 --> 00:51:37,989
[SPEAKER_30]: And thank you, everyone, for your patience.

532
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:46,317
[SPEAKER_30]: go through all the details of the project and all the public improvements that are included.

533
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:59,020
[SPEAKER_30]: I would just like to wrap up by saying that housing is a top priority for both Tufts University and the city, and this project does increase on-campus housing.

534
00:52:00,181 --> 00:52:09,443
[SPEAKER_30]: It is also in the same shared values that the city and Tufts have about building near public transit,

535
00:52:10,143 --> 00:52:18,447
[SPEAKER_30]: improving retail opportunities on Boston Avenue and creating buildings that are energy efficient and passive house design.

536
00:52:19,608 --> 00:52:22,649
[SPEAKER_30]: So again, just want to thank you, Adam Chair.

537
00:52:23,169 --> 00:52:25,511
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Director Hunt and Danielle.

538
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:28,172
[SPEAKER_30]: And we would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.

539
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:42,371
[SPEAKER_29]: I think you're muted, Madam Chair.

540
00:52:43,312 --> 00:52:43,692
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

541
00:52:43,712 --> 00:52:49,638
[SPEAKER_39]: I was saying thank you so much for the presentation and thank you to your partners for the presentation.

542
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:55,264
[SPEAKER_39]: And before I open it up for the board to speak, I actually just want to reiterate a couple of things.

543
00:52:55,584 --> 00:52:55,745
[SPEAKER_39]: One, if

544
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:05,892
[SPEAKER_39]: I just want to make sure that the public understands that there will be a time very shortly that I will open it up for public comment.

545
00:53:06,872 --> 00:53:11,736
[SPEAKER_39]: But I want a reminder that any comments in the chat are not included as part of the public record.

546
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,177
[SPEAKER_39]: So please save them.

547
00:53:13,998 --> 00:53:18,601
[SPEAKER_39]: Or you can email them to OCD at method-ma.gov.

548
00:53:19,222 --> 00:53:23,685
[SPEAKER_39]: Please do not message Danielle during this time and do not put them into the chat.

549
00:53:27,433 --> 00:53:32,017
[SPEAKER_39]: And with that being said, I will open it up to the board for any questions.

550
00:53:32,317 --> 00:53:52,114
[SPEAKER_39]: And I do know that on this, uh, Peter cows, is there, and if I can ask whoever is sharing their screen, if you can, please, uh, it will allow us to be able to see the hands more so that we can control for the public comments.

551
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:53,575
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much.

552
00:53:56,249 --> 00:53:57,130
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, Madam Chair.

553
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:57,850
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

554
00:53:58,291 --> 00:53:59,671
[SPEAKER_33]: I think this is what you're talking about.

555
00:54:01,733 --> 00:54:09,558
[SPEAKER_33]: For this item, I will be recusing myself as I work for Niche Engineering, which worked a good bit on this project.

556
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:20,945
[SPEAKER_33]: And as per policy, if something comes before the board that Niche has worked on, it is our policy to recuse ourselves from that item.

557
00:54:21,065 --> 00:54:21,986
[SPEAKER_33]: So thank you, Madam Chair.

558
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:23,985
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, thank you so much.

559
00:54:24,226 --> 00:54:32,008
[SPEAKER_39]: And if the city staff can actually help me with the hands down for now, that's not part of the board so that I can see who's on the board.

560
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:35,689
[SPEAKER_39]: And then we will go to the public comment in order.

561
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:45,453
[SPEAKER_39]: Oh, I believe I see Adam Behrens.

562
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:54,923
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, I just had a question for the tough staff regarding just more of the bigger picture for the university.

563
00:54:57,465 --> 00:55:03,810
[SPEAKER_35]: Is the university planning to expand the student population or the student size?

564
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:10,276
[SPEAKER_35]: and just how the dorm sort of fits into the strategic goal that the university has for the student population.

565
00:55:10,296 --> 00:55:17,443
[SPEAKER_35]: You don't have to be super in-depth, I just wanted to get a little bit more of that context of how the dorm fits into that goal.

566
00:55:18,753 --> 00:55:19,493
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Adam.

567
00:55:19,513 --> 00:55:20,574
[SPEAKER_30]: I appreciate that question.

568
00:55:20,594 --> 00:55:27,298
[SPEAKER_30]: Our goal with this project is to get juniors and seniors that are living off campus and bring them back on campus.

569
00:55:27,819 --> 00:55:30,300
[SPEAKER_30]: That is a strategic goal of our new president.

570
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:37,085
[SPEAKER_30]: He has also said that he does not plan to increase undergraduate enrollment.

571
00:55:38,526 --> 00:55:48,312
[SPEAKER_30]: So our purpose for this project and how it fits into our strategic goals is really that objective of bringing students that are off campus back onto campus.

572
00:55:48,972 --> 00:55:53,858
[SPEAKER_30]: which we think is a is a big benefit for our students, but also for the neighborhoods that surround the campus.

573
00:55:58,644 --> 00:55:59,205
[SPEAKER_35]: Thanks.

574
00:56:00,266 --> 00:56:00,607
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

575
00:56:00,627 --> 00:56:05,253
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm not seeing any other board members as of right now.

576
00:56:09,387 --> 00:56:10,747
[SPEAKER_39]: And thank you, Adam, for that question.

577
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:28,490
[SPEAKER_39]: I actually believe that freeing up housing stock and lowering the demand of the pressure, as Mr. Mahed recently said, the demand on pressure of rents and put many more housing options within reach for workforce and families is a benefit at this point.

578
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:36,812
[SPEAKER_39]: But one of my biggest questions and concern was, are you actually accounting for higher enrollment rates or are you actually

579
00:56:37,973 --> 00:56:42,220
[SPEAKER_39]: technically freeing up the students and freeing up that housing stock.

580
00:56:42,741 --> 00:56:48,751
[SPEAKER_39]: I also believe that increasing the commercial activity and vibrancy on Boston Ave in the area of the Green Line stop is a good thing.

581
00:56:49,352 --> 00:56:50,353
[SPEAKER_39]: I also believe that this is

582
00:56:53,040 --> 00:57:01,462
[SPEAKER_39]: You know, having a parking lot next to a transit station, especially a parking lot next to a massive parking garage is not ideal.

583
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:07,324
[SPEAKER_39]: So I think that's an ideal situation with the housing going in.

584
00:57:07,784 --> 00:57:15,206
[SPEAKER_39]: However, there are butters and there are concerns by the public for various reasons.

585
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:23,121
[SPEAKER_39]: And in saying that, I will open it up for public comment so that we can begin to hear those concerns.

586
00:57:25,502 --> 00:57:27,403
[SPEAKER_39]: And I will read the public hearing.

587
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,182
[SPEAKER_39]: I will now open the public comment period.

588
00:57:32,502 --> 00:57:38,487
[SPEAKER_39]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the chat if you are having technical difficulties.

589
00:57:39,008 --> 00:57:43,792
[SPEAKER_39]: You can also send an email to OCD at method-ma.gov.

590
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:47,475
[SPEAKER_39]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

591
00:57:48,095 --> 00:57:55,841
[SPEAKER_39]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide substantive comments, as it is not part of the public record.

592
00:57:56,201 --> 00:58:02,847
[SPEAKER_39]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

593
00:58:03,968 --> 00:58:12,995
[SPEAKER_39]: Depending on the number of commenters, which we have a substantial amount tonight, we have to limit this to two minutes per comment.

594
00:58:14,748 --> 00:58:20,433
[SPEAKER_39]: Alicia or Daniel, can you, Alicia, can you, Director Hunt, can you please manage the public comment queue?

595
00:58:21,895 --> 00:58:26,819
[SPEAKER_39]: If it's not possible to read all the email letters at this point, I'm not sure how many are coming in.

596
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:36,008
[SPEAKER_39]: Are you able to summarize the themes for us so that the public and the board can know what those concerns are?

597
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:44,397
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Madam Chair, would you like me to summarize the written comments first before we take the verbal comments?

598
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:45,939
[SPEAKER_39]: Actually, yes.

599
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:55,409
[SPEAKER_39]: And then unless you want to hear the verbal comments and then possibly those summarized written comments will resonate with those, I'm not sure.

600
00:58:57,675 --> 00:58:58,916
[SPEAKER_39]: What's more beneficial sharing here?

601
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:01,238
[SPEAKER_24]: I did provide a written document.

602
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:14,610
[SPEAKER_24]: So the public knows for all the comments that came in by 5.30 this evening, they were all saved in a file for the board so that they can read all of them in detail if they want to.

603
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:21,677
[SPEAKER_24]: I also provided a Word document with a summary of all of the comments

604
00:59:23,735 --> 00:59:28,469
[SPEAKER_24]: As summarized by what each person said as opposed to summarizing.

605
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:39,066
[SPEAKER_24]: sorry, I was trying to open my summary file at the same time I was speaking, as opposed to one long summary.

606
00:59:39,527 --> 00:59:41,748
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think that I could pretty well summarize it.

607
00:59:42,308 --> 00:59:46,590
[SPEAKER_24]: I will share that there, I'll actually start in reverse order.

608
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:55,754
[SPEAKER_24]: So there is a flyer going around with a link to a form that is sending a standard message

609
00:59:56,654 --> 01:00:14,721
[SPEAKER_24]: uh opposing the parking waiver, but there seems to be some significant confusion about what the parking waiver is Because the letter doesn't actually address what the actual parking waiver that's been requested is um, and we're not really sure where How how these two connect?

610
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:18,562
[SPEAKER_24]: um, but we have As at about 5 30 this evening

611
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:37,343
[SPEAKER_24]: five people who had sent the form letter saying that the exact same form letter that they were opposed to a parking waiver and we had received actually five people had sent letters saying they were supporting a parking waiver and they didn't want to see additional parking built through this.

612
01:00:39,485 --> 01:00:50,569
[SPEAKER_24]: But I do think that we may want to just address that issue so that there's some clarity about what is being requested because there is confusion being circulated among the public.

613
01:00:51,529 --> 01:00:54,650
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we want to address that first and then I'll go to the other comments?

614
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:55,410
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

615
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:56,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

616
01:00:57,351 --> 01:00:58,891
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

617
01:00:59,232 --> 01:01:06,334
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe that I shared with you the form letter that we had received.

618
01:01:07,474 --> 01:01:08,915
[SPEAKER_24]: Could you actually help us by

619
01:01:10,192 --> 01:01:13,396
[SPEAKER_24]: explaining what the parking waiver is that you are asking for.

620
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:18,862
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that would help the members of the public who have submitted this letter.

621
01:01:20,104 --> 01:01:20,344
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

622
01:01:20,785 --> 01:01:23,648
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Director Hunt and Madam Chair, if I may.

623
01:01:24,509 --> 01:01:25,851
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm happy to respond to that.

624
01:01:27,012 --> 01:01:28,253
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'll talk first.

625
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:31,498
[SPEAKER_32]: I think just high level what we're trying to do.

626
01:01:32,878 --> 01:01:42,081
[SPEAKER_32]: So ordinarily, under the zoning ordinance, this project would be required to implement, I believe it's 170 parking spaces.

627
01:01:43,262 --> 01:01:51,144
[SPEAKER_32]: Given the nature of the project, it's a dormitory where the students who are living there, by and large, are not bringing cars to campus.

628
01:01:52,064 --> 01:01:56,406
[SPEAKER_32]: And given the excess availability of parking elsewhere on campus,

629
01:01:57,262 --> 01:02:09,350
[SPEAKER_32]: we're seeking a waiver or the approval of a shared parking arrangement that would enable folks who are bringing their cars to park elsewhere on campus.

630
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:22,179
[SPEAKER_32]: And the reason why we need a waiver is because ordinarily, if we were to share parking or if we were seeking to share parking, it would need to be located within a certain distance of the project site.

631
01:02:22,879 --> 01:02:26,702
[SPEAKER_32]: But in this case, given the nature of the college campus,

632
01:02:27,984 --> 01:02:32,528
[SPEAKER_32]: students might be parking elsewhere on campus and not necessarily in the Dallin Hall garage.

633
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:47,781
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're trying to take advantage of the university's existing parking capacity to be able to not create any new parking in connection with the project.

634
01:02:48,142 --> 01:02:54,748
[SPEAKER_32]: And so I think just the technical element of that, it would either be

635
01:02:55,814 --> 01:03:07,383
[SPEAKER_32]: a shared parking approval under 6.1.9 of the zoning ordinance, or a waiver under 6.1.10 of the zoning ordinance, the practical effect is the same.

636
01:03:07,463 --> 01:03:15,790
[SPEAKER_32]: As I said, we're seeking to utilize the existing parking capacity on the campus to accommodate any new demand resulting from the project.

637
01:03:18,867 --> 01:03:19,207
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

638
01:03:19,287 --> 01:03:20,827
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that helps clarify it.

639
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:29,549
[SPEAKER_24]: And I will comment that the board received the traffic study, including the parking information only today.

640
01:03:30,049 --> 01:03:36,571
[SPEAKER_24]: So there is no intention to actually get a full presentation and to address traffic issues tonight.

641
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:42,152
[SPEAKER_24]: The city's traffic director has not had a chance to review that yet and provide his comments.

642
01:03:42,592 --> 01:03:54,604
[SPEAKER_24]: So there is an expectation that this meeting won't close, this hearing won't close tonight, but rather we will talk in more depth about parking and traffic and transportation at the next meeting.

643
01:03:54,624 --> 01:04:03,954
[SPEAKER_24]: I just, I appreciate that because I would hate for people to keep drafting letters and sending us letters that are not reflecting what you're actually asking for.

644
01:04:05,696 --> 01:04:06,497
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

645
01:04:06,517 --> 01:04:25,025
[SPEAKER_24]: So that said, the board, as of five o'clock this evening, had received one, two, three, four, five general letters of support saying they think this norm is a good idea, including one of them was for the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

646
01:04:26,626 --> 01:04:33,509
[SPEAKER_24]: We then received a number of individual letters, one, two, three, four, five,

647
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:52,527
[SPEAKER_24]: six that seven have very a lot of very similar concerns several of those people are here this evening I expect they're going to want to speak for themselves, but in general, the comments were that the building was too tall.

648
01:04:53,867 --> 01:05:13,713
[SPEAKER_24]: that they were concerned about the relationship of the large surface areas of the large buildings and rain and wind, noise pollution, noise reflecting off the buildings, how this wind could impact their houses down below, light from the rooms, from the windows,

649
01:05:15,814 --> 01:05:31,182
[SPEAKER_24]: whether this large building there would make the trains that are along the train track, but make them feel the vibration more, whether it would impact the water table, and then a lot of comments about shading and light loss.

650
01:05:31,963 --> 01:05:41,088
[SPEAKER_24]: There was also some concern about additional traffic on Boston Ave because of the dorm, that it would bring more traffic to the location.

651
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:52,837
[SPEAKER_24]: I will say that many of the letters did support the idea of having tough students live on campus and supported the idea of a dorm in general, but felt that this building was too large.

652
01:05:54,018 --> 01:06:06,008
[SPEAKER_24]: There was a group letter with 54 signatures that explicitly said they support the project in general, including on-campus housing, density near transit,

653
01:06:06,391 --> 01:06:12,476
[SPEAKER_24]: improved rail on Boston Ave, and that it was an energy efficient building, but they were concerned that it was too tall.

654
01:06:12,576 --> 01:06:33,395
[SPEAKER_24]: They were concerned about the sound and light pollution, net new shadows in their homes and yards, limiting their solar potential and increases to cost their homes, and that they would really like to see public realm improvements, including on-site stormwater management, improved sidewalks, protected bike lanes, defined spaces for deliveries and queuing.

655
01:06:34,075 --> 01:06:47,198
[SPEAKER_24]: frequent well-lit, well-marked crosswalks, new canopy trees on both sides, both to counter the heat island effect and to buffer the light and sound from their homes, and traffic calm and consistent with complete street guidelines.

656
01:06:47,718 --> 01:06:54,320
[SPEAKER_24]: And they were questioning whether using a for-profit development partner negated the use of the Dover Amendment.

657
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:59,701
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's a general summary of the written comments that came in.

658
01:07:00,161 --> 01:07:03,502
[SPEAKER_24]: As you can tell, there were so many that if I were to read them all, we would be here all night.

659
01:07:05,824 --> 01:07:21,377
[SPEAKER_39]: Just quickly, as far as if this is a Dover use amendment, I just wanted to reiterate, especially just to make clear for everyone, without being a lawyer, Tufts obviously is using it for an educational purpose.

660
01:07:21,617 --> 01:07:25,320
[SPEAKER_39]: This is housing for their students, solely for their students.

661
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:28,943
[SPEAKER_39]: So that should definitely fall in the lines of it being a Dover amendment.

662
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:29,884
[SPEAKER_39]: So I wanted to make sure

663
01:07:30,444 --> 01:07:42,074
[SPEAKER_39]: Director Hunt that and you can speak more on that because I know that there was some questions regarding that regardless of the public partnership, the housing piece.

664
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:48,060
[SPEAKER_24]: And for students, right, so we did check in with our legal staff.

665
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:58,725
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, we've been dealing with tops and Dover amendment for so long that some of this is clear, but we did check in with our legal staff today and yesterday.

666
01:07:59,406 --> 01:08:01,167
[SPEAKER_24]: And the short answer is yes.

667
01:08:02,247 --> 01:08:19,614
[SPEAKER_24]: Tufts is building a dorm for students that there are some, the nonprofit entity that owns it, relationship needs to be like worked out that that, but there is no question that that is going to happen and that this is a dorm for Tufts students and this qualifies under Dover.

668
01:08:20,694 --> 01:08:28,956
[SPEAKER_24]: There was some other legal questions that we got around other little, can we apply other pieces of our zoning code to this?

669
01:08:29,556 --> 01:08:43,799
[SPEAKER_24]: And honestly, that question came in today and legal counsel said that they would meet with us, they would review everything and meet with us before the continued hearing date in order to just address

670
01:08:45,099 --> 01:09:02,666
[SPEAKER_24]: those nuances about whether there are pieces of the code that we could enforce through with this being a Dover or that we might want to talk about, but that they couldn't give us an answer on less than a couple of hours notice on that piece of the question.

671
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:09,148
[SPEAKER_24]: But the Dover, using Dover itself, they said, that is absolutely, this is a Dover case.

672
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:12,790
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Doretta.

673
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:22,772
[SPEAKER_39]: And with that, I'm not sure if you've kept account of who put their hands up first.

674
01:09:24,065 --> 01:09:31,670
[SPEAKER_24]: So it is my experience that Zoom keeps the hands in order unless a hand goes down and back up.

675
01:09:33,231 --> 01:09:39,955
[SPEAKER_24]: So with your permission, we'll call on them in the order that they are on the screen.

676
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:45,339
[SPEAKER_24]: I will read your name as it is written on the screen because that is what the information we have for you.

677
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:51,983
[SPEAKER_24]: We ask that everybody please state your name and your address for the record and we do have an intern

678
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:56,712
[SPEAKER_24]: who may chime in if he needs assistance hearing the name and address.

679
01:09:59,413 --> 01:10:03,875
[SPEAKER_24]: And with that, oh, is somebody else keeping time on these?

680
01:10:04,035 --> 01:10:06,756
[SPEAKER_24]: I need somebody, not me, to keep time.

681
01:10:07,656 --> 01:10:09,437
[SPEAKER_24]: But we have a lot of staff on this call.

682
01:10:11,658 --> 01:10:13,479
[SPEAKER_38]: Through the chair, this is Danielle Evans.

683
01:10:14,539 --> 01:10:16,680
[SPEAKER_38]: I can keep time, was it two minutes?

684
01:10:17,606 --> 01:10:23,770
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, we're going to give two minutes due to the substantial amount of commenters.

685
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:24,170
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

686
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:43,422
[SPEAKER_38]: And also, I just want to add that if folks could go ahead and change their screen names so that we can accurately record your comments with your name for the record, if you want to be on the record of having commented, that would make things easier for our minutes taker.

687
01:10:45,343 --> 01:10:45,603
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

688
01:10:48,693 --> 01:10:50,054
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, are you ready, Madam Chair?

689
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:50,794
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

690
01:10:51,395 --> 01:10:54,136
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, the first commenter is Tom Wall.

691
01:10:58,939 --> 01:10:59,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everybody.

692
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,160
[SPEAKER_40]: Hello.

693
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:03,422
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Tom Wall, I'm a Medford resident.

694
01:11:03,502 --> 01:11:06,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I live on Hillsdale Road, up on the hillside.

695
01:11:08,345 --> 01:11:11,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And I deal with pups and pups students every day of my life.

696
01:11:12,107 --> 01:11:14,808
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do have two questions.

697
01:11:15,809 --> 01:11:16,709
[SPEAKER_03]: The first concerns,

698
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:24,779
[SPEAKER_03]: building trades and the contracts associated with the Building Trades Council provide area standard wages and benefits to workers.

699
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:29,944
[SPEAKER_03]: They also create opportunities for area residents to enter into training programs that lead to sustainable careers.

700
01:11:30,484 --> 01:11:36,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first question is, is the development team working with the Building Trades Council, the local Building Trades Council?

701
01:11:37,511 --> 01:11:38,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second question is,

702
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Wage theft, I'd like to address wage theft.

703
01:11:43,241 --> 01:11:45,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Representative workers really encounter wage theft.

704
01:11:45,982 --> 01:11:49,724
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are issues, they're generally resolved quickly without further intervention.

705
01:11:50,484 --> 01:11:52,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Unrepresented workers, on the other hand, aren't that lucky.

706
01:11:53,545 --> 01:11:58,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's estimated that $1 billion are stolen from workers in the construction industry annually.

707
01:11:58,827 --> 01:12:00,288
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes from an AG report.

708
01:12:01,649 --> 01:12:07,471
[SPEAKER_03]: What is Tufts and the development team's plan to ensure wage theft is not present on this project?

709
01:12:11,435 --> 01:12:29,588
[SPEAKER_39]: And just to be clear, for our opponent and your all partners, we can wait until the end to do a collective answer because there may be some more of the same exact questions and we can summarize and you can answer as needed, as you feel is needed.

710
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,930
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Mr. Wong.

711
01:12:34,051 --> 01:12:34,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

712
01:12:36,293 --> 01:12:39,335
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Judith Weinstock.

713
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Judith Weinstock.

714
01:12:47,441 --> 01:12:49,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 144 Brigette Avenue.

715
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:58,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see some of the positive effects, particularly for Tufts, of the project.

716
01:12:59,103 --> 01:13:03,524
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can appreciate, I certainly have never had any issue with the aesthetics of Tufts.

717
01:13:03,564 --> 01:13:07,725
[SPEAKER_10]: When they build buildings, they tend to be lovely on the outside.

718
01:13:08,325 --> 01:13:09,826
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have no concerns there.

719
01:13:09,926 --> 01:13:14,547
[SPEAKER_10]: But as you know, the board knows, because I've corresponded twice,

720
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:28,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I really, really think that the light emissions from the building, regardless of the fact that in theory, there are 30% glass on the facades of the building, according to David, I think.

721
01:13:28,896 --> 01:13:37,061
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if we do some rough math, so let's just say there are 677 people living in that building.

722
01:13:39,122 --> 01:13:40,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's assume that there are

723
01:13:41,324 --> 01:13:51,750
[SPEAKER_10]: for 300 windows on the front and the back and maybe splitting up the remaining, because there's got to be a building per student, right, if they're going to have bedrooms.

724
01:13:52,210 --> 01:14:01,014
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's just assume that there are hundreds of windows that will be emitting light into the surrounding neighborhood and down the hill.

725
01:14:01,595 --> 01:14:03,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to understand better.

726
01:14:03,576 --> 01:14:04,977
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess this is a question.

727
01:14:05,437 --> 01:14:06,978
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it that prevents?

728
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:16,515
[SPEAKER_10]: the project planners from building in low emission light windows into the building costs and structure.

729
01:14:17,136 --> 01:14:18,617
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be my first question.

730
01:14:18,657 --> 01:14:20,139
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it that prevents you?

731
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:22,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it a financial issue?

732
01:14:23,281 --> 01:14:27,825
[SPEAKER_10]: And if so, can you please frame the scope of the size of that problem?

733
01:14:28,586 --> 01:14:29,747
[SPEAKER_10]: And the second thing is,

734
01:14:31,457 --> 01:14:35,239
[SPEAKER_10]: What will happen if it, in fact, is not students who are living in the building?

735
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:49,726
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my understanding from Rocco, who I spoke with yesterday, that the leases in this building will be 12-month-a-year leases for the people living there, and that if it can't be filled with students, it will be filled somehow.

736
01:14:50,447 --> 01:14:53,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I guess the question of the day is, what is happening there?

737
01:14:57,325 --> 01:15:02,108
[SPEAKER_10]: if they, in fact, juniors and seniors do not want to live on campus in the numbers of 677.

738
01:15:02,188 --> 01:15:10,814
[SPEAKER_10]: So to give you a little extra.

739
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:13,776
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Miss Weinstock.

740
01:15:16,237 --> 01:15:19,940
[SPEAKER_24]: The next person with the raised hand is a Bernie.

741
01:15:23,521 --> 01:15:24,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, I think that's me.

742
01:15:24,382 --> 01:15:25,242
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't figure out Zoom.

743
01:15:25,402 --> 01:15:26,243
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll put my name in.

744
01:15:27,003 --> 01:15:27,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?

745
01:15:28,044 --> 01:15:28,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

746
01:15:28,664 --> 01:15:29,144
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, great.

747
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:29,885
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Amy.

748
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,025
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually live next to Judy.

749
01:15:31,045 --> 01:15:33,067
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm at 138 Burgett Avenue.

750
01:15:34,267 --> 01:15:37,049
[SPEAKER_17]: And I guess just overall comments, housing on campus, fine.

751
01:15:37,089 --> 01:15:37,989
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not really sure.

752
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:40,231
[SPEAKER_17]: You said 6,000 on your students.

753
01:15:40,451 --> 01:15:42,432
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's about 10% of housing going in there.

754
01:15:42,692 --> 01:15:46,334
[SPEAKER_17]: On the other side of me, I have renters all the time from your campus.

755
01:15:46,795 --> 01:15:51,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Since I've been here nine years, it's construction of tufts somewhere around me.

756
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,361
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems high, 10 stories.

757
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:59,502
[SPEAKER_17]: If I look at the opposing thing across, 10 floors seems a lot.

758
01:15:59,602 --> 01:16:02,824
[SPEAKER_17]: It's two floors higher, I think, in the parking garage next door.

759
01:16:02,844 --> 01:16:05,565
[SPEAKER_17]: It would have been nice if it was kept even.

760
01:16:05,585 --> 01:16:09,146
[SPEAKER_17]: The sun in the back of my yard, even in the summer, disappears.

761
01:16:09,186 --> 01:16:10,927
[SPEAKER_17]: I get a little sliver by the shed.

762
01:16:13,857 --> 01:16:16,338
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it will be improvements to Boston Ave.

763
01:16:16,378 --> 01:16:17,058
[SPEAKER_17]: That part looks good.

764
01:16:17,078 --> 01:16:18,718
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be curious about the retail going in there.

765
01:16:18,759 --> 01:16:26,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully it would be something interesting to the neighborhood, not just something that competes with the mom and pop shops down the road.

766
01:16:27,561 --> 01:16:32,743
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm curious about the extra space you're going to find for sidewalks, because it seems you'd have to dig out of the ground, I guess.

767
01:16:32,783 --> 01:16:36,764
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not much sidewalk there to begin with, so I'm not really sure how you're getting more space there.

768
01:16:38,264 --> 01:16:38,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Parking.

769
01:16:41,664 --> 01:16:48,508
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be curious how many students have cars on campus now just because we're so close to where that would be on our dead end street.

770
01:16:48,528 --> 01:16:53,712
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess the comment is, I moved to a dead end street to look at a nice quiet neighborhood that really changes.

771
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:58,695
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks like assembly row to me up there with the type of construction that's being done.

772
01:17:00,885 --> 01:17:06,646
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what to say about that, other than it just seems like imposing in the neighborhood.

773
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:08,446
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I'll phrase it.

774
01:17:08,526 --> 01:17:12,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Two big buildings, it sort of changes the nature of these.

775
01:17:13,047 --> 01:17:15,608
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you go to the other streets around there, just little bungalow houses.

776
01:17:15,668 --> 01:17:21,189
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're like these little tiny houses in the shadow now of these assembly row looking buildings.

777
01:17:21,209 --> 01:17:21,769
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know.

778
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:23,029
[SPEAKER_17]: 10 stories seems like a lot.

779
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:26,869
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll yield my time, but just wanted to make those points known.

780
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:29,590
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much.

781
01:17:33,183 --> 01:17:36,165
[SPEAKER_24]: The next person with their hand raised is Dan McNulty.

782
01:17:39,707 --> 01:17:41,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my name is Dan McNulty.

783
01:17:41,388 --> 01:17:43,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a member of Laborers Local 22.

784
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:45,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also a Medford resident.

785
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:49,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 16 Lewis Street in Medford by Hickey Park in Gillis Field.

786
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:57,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to comment tonight to talk about labor standards for this project and making sure that

787
01:17:58,117 --> 01:18:02,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Tufts, as well as the community development board is really looking at requirements.

788
01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:06,989
[SPEAKER_02]: They can place to make sure that this is a good beneficial project for the community.

789
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:10,975
[SPEAKER_02]: That can take the form of requiring registered apprenticeship on it.

790
01:18:11,135 --> 01:18:12,316
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're creating demand for.

791
01:18:13,598 --> 01:18:19,105
[SPEAKER_02]: young people coming in getting good wages and benefits as they are learning their craft.

792
01:18:19,525 --> 01:18:26,693
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also talk about local resident requirements, braids women and people of color requirements on the project.

793
01:18:27,194 --> 01:18:33,521
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this is standard practice to put into a project and ensure it's not just a good faith effort and that it's

794
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:37,163
[SPEAKER_02]: genuinely monitored and followed.

795
01:18:37,243 --> 01:18:52,190
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd really urge this board to reach out to Greater Boston Building Trades Unions and other organized labor groups to see how those standards have been used and find out in doing so that it can still be a competitive process, it can still have

796
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:55,212
[SPEAKER_02]: union and non-union contractors competing on it.

797
01:18:55,613 --> 01:19:00,317
[SPEAKER_02]: But if those standards aren't there, this is going to be a race to the bottom for the cheapest labor possible.

798
01:19:00,457 --> 01:19:06,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a loss for Tufts and this ambitious building design with energy, as well as for the community.

799
01:19:08,825 --> 01:19:09,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

800
01:19:12,408 --> 01:19:15,071
[SPEAKER_24]: The next hand raised is Catherine Leach.

801
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:29,528
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, my name is Catherine Leach, I live at 31 Windsor Road, so right by the proposed site, and just wanted to express support for building a large dorm for Tufts students.

802
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:37,114
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm currently a renter, my rent goes up every year, and we are quite cost burdened in this community with regard to rent.

803
01:19:37,914 --> 01:19:41,978
[SPEAKER_41]: So it'd be great to see Tufts take on some of the burden of housing in our community.

804
01:19:43,899 --> 01:19:51,105
[SPEAKER_41]: And I was definitely turned out also by the flyer around the parking waiver that seems to be non-existent.

805
01:19:51,165 --> 01:19:57,229
[SPEAKER_41]: But I also just wanted to express support for not building additional parking for these units.

806
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,891
[SPEAKER_41]: I personally do drive in Medford.

807
01:19:59,951 --> 01:20:01,993
[SPEAKER_41]: I have no trouble finding a parking spot.

808
01:20:02,654 --> 01:20:09,139
[SPEAKER_41]: And I think it's good that we're disincentivizing students from bringing cars to campus by having them live on campus.

809
01:20:09,299 --> 01:20:11,660
[SPEAKER_41]: And hopefully, that will reduce traffic in our community.

810
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:12,261
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

811
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:16,722
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

812
01:20:17,782 --> 01:20:19,923
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Jeremy Martin.

813
01:20:22,483 --> 01:20:23,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

814
01:20:23,644 --> 01:20:24,764
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jeremy Martin.

815
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:26,904
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 65 Burgett Avenue.

816
01:20:26,924 --> 01:20:33,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a member of the Medford Conservation Commissioner.

817
01:20:33,546 --> 01:20:40,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep my comments brief since we've already submitted a letter endorsed by many of our neighbors expressing our concerns about the project.

818
01:20:40,887 --> 01:20:54,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start by saying I support development on this site, and I support Tufts' original proposal to build seven-story buildings here, keeping with the scale of the surrounding buildings and significantly reducing the negative environmental impacts on the adjacent neighborhood.

819
01:20:55,073 --> 01:21:05,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Tufts owns numerous other properties that could be densified to more sensibly distribute on-campus undergrad housing and achieve their housing goals without such an acute impact on neighbors.

820
01:21:06,757 --> 01:21:16,785
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been misled by Tufts in this process and have been disappointed with the distorted process for notifying the community about the project and the unaddressed questions about its Dover status.

821
01:21:17,145 --> 01:21:25,792
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand it's educational, but it is being developed by a for-profit entity, and we question whether that undermines their Dover status.

822
01:21:26,933 --> 01:21:34,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And it severely reduces the city's means to ensure abutters are protected from harm through a full site plan review, which is appropriate for this project.

823
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:42,483
[SPEAKER_00]: At any height, this project needs to come with infrastructure improvements appropriate for a change in use of this scale on this already underperforming street.

824
01:21:43,044 --> 01:21:50,167
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't take neighborhood pressure to get street trees or reasonable traffic and mobility modifications added to a project like this.

825
01:21:50,827 --> 01:22:08,784
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very encouraging to see street trees added to the plans and renderings presented tonight, but as we heard repeatedly, these trees are still a big maybe, and these last minute changes are meaningless until they are incorporated into the technical drawings submitted as part of the site plan review application, which to date they are not.

826
01:22:09,605 --> 01:22:22,048
[SPEAKER_00]: To city leadership who have decided this development is in the community's best interest, we hope you're hearing us loud and clear that this particular building is not in our best interest and there are better ways to achieve the city's housing goals.

827
01:22:22,748 --> 01:22:30,410
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the community development board, you're being asked to provide relief on several aspects of this project that did not meet the ordinance or zoning code.

828
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:48,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage you to consider approving those relief requests only under the conditions that the building height be reduced to seven stories to reduce harm on the hillside community, and that the public realm be further improved, guaranteed to be improved to mitigate the significant impact this project will have on daily users of Boston Avenue.

829
01:22:48,975 --> 01:22:50,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time and consideration.

830
01:22:52,335 --> 01:22:53,296
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Mr. Martin.

831
01:22:55,436 --> 01:22:58,457
[SPEAKER_24]: The next resident is Lori Krieger.

832
01:22:59,748 --> 01:23:00,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, everyone.

833
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:02,089
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Lori Krieger.

834
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:03,949
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm at 124 Brookings Street.

835
01:23:04,149 --> 01:23:09,111
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to really ask all of the people on the board, please read our letters in full.

836
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:15,013
[SPEAKER_15]: We've spent hours working on them so that we can be clear with you and have a communication outlet with you.

837
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:17,934
[SPEAKER_15]: I also second everything that Jeremy just said.

838
01:23:20,035 --> 01:23:24,339
[SPEAKER_15]: This what I'm just about to say is an addendum to what I already put in my letter to you all.

839
01:23:24,559 --> 01:23:34,206
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's just no way any project of this scope with this impact on the greater community should be allowed to go forward without the input and buy-in of that community.

840
01:23:34,626 --> 01:23:45,735
[SPEAKER_15]: That a project of this magnitude has included neighborhood input or even has not included neighborhood input or even shared with the community at all as at odds with how healthy communities function.

841
01:23:46,315 --> 01:23:55,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Though Tufts touts that this will free up housing in our neighborhood, there's no discussion linkage to affordable housing or even making the homes usable by young couples and families.

842
01:23:55,739 --> 01:24:00,061
[SPEAKER_15]: There has also been no discussion of impact of our infrastructure in any of these meetings.

843
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:03,542
[SPEAKER_15]: This building is out of scale and inappropriate because of that.

844
01:24:03,983 --> 01:24:09,305
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so tall it will block out the positive, the passive sunlight we count on during the cooler months.

845
01:24:09,845 --> 01:24:15,671
[SPEAKER_15]: If you look at the history of the hillside, you know we've already undergone drastic changes due to the Green Line extension.

846
01:24:16,071 --> 01:24:21,697
[SPEAKER_15]: We want development and progress, but one that includes us and supports our lives as well.

847
01:24:22,378 --> 01:24:30,182
[SPEAKER_15]: The Greenline extension did not come with expected mitigation like train beds that would absorb the vibrations of the heavy rail or large canopy tree replacement.

848
01:24:30,703 --> 01:24:36,926
[SPEAKER_15]: And in these designs, there has been no inclusion of any life-sustaining components to mitigate the effects of such enormous buildings.

849
01:24:37,366 --> 01:24:43,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Mitigation of sound, trains and street traffic of the building, light reverberations from the heavy rail amplified from the buildings,

850
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:46,972
[SPEAKER_15]: wing tunnels, reintroduction of large canopy trees.

851
01:24:47,032 --> 01:24:48,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, we don't know that's going to happen.

852
01:24:49,353 --> 01:24:54,096
[SPEAKER_15]: And bringing the buildings down to scale so they don't impede the winter sun are all essential.

853
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:58,498
[SPEAKER_15]: We recommend the board have Tufts redesign the project with the communities affected.

854
01:24:58,538 --> 01:25:06,283
[SPEAKER_15]: That's us, anyone on the hillside, anyone who uses Boston Ave regularly and is part of the constituency to reimagine this project.

855
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:09,152
[SPEAKER_15]: We even asked the board to do a field trip to Hillside.

856
01:25:09,192 --> 01:25:14,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Come visit us and speak with us and imagine the proposed building from our vantage point.

857
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:21,823
[SPEAKER_15]: But also please take a tour up Curtis Avenue and see that there are multiple service parking lots on the Tufts campus as well.

858
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:25,686
[SPEAKER_15]: That could easily be multi-story dorms.

859
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,451
[SPEAKER_39]: And who is the next speaker?

860
01:25:33,672 --> 01:25:35,693
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Paula's iPhone.

861
01:25:36,413 --> 01:25:39,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Please state your full name and address for the record.

862
01:25:39,715 --> 01:25:44,637
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, hi, my name is Paula Parisi, and I own property at 70 Colby Street.

863
01:25:45,537 --> 01:25:59,503
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just curious about, you said that the buildings have no fossil fuel usage, and I'm worried, I'm concerned, is this all coming off the grid that's currently being used?

864
01:26:01,043 --> 01:26:02,284
[SPEAKER_18]: Does Tufts have their own?

865
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:09,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Generators are, you know, I'm just concerned about the electricity usage.

866
01:26:09,802 --> 01:26:13,665
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

867
01:26:15,006 --> 01:26:15,627
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

868
01:26:18,929 --> 01:26:22,892
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Janie Tallarita.

869
01:26:23,373 --> 01:26:26,175
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, I think I got your name wrong, misspoke.

870
01:26:32,337 --> 01:26:33,781
[SPEAKER_44]: Hi there, can you hear me okay?

871
01:26:35,224 --> 01:26:36,587
[SPEAKER_44]: You actually got my name right.

872
01:26:36,728 --> 01:26:38,412
[SPEAKER_44]: It is Janie Tallarita.

873
01:26:38,432 --> 01:26:41,279
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm at 68 Charnwood Road.

874
01:26:42,522 --> 01:26:44,302
[SPEAKER_44]: just down the street from this project.

875
01:26:45,843 --> 01:27:09,128
[SPEAKER_44]: And I do want to thank you all for taking our comments, share a few concerns about the project and I'm hoping that the city will consider the review of the site plan and ensure that any approval is truly consistent with Dover amendment includes and includes conditions that address building height, light and sound pollution,

876
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:14,548
[SPEAKER_44]: The opportunity for streetscape improvement like shade trees, glad to see that in there.

877
01:27:15,489 --> 01:27:20,953
[SPEAKER_44]: And also, how does this truly address affordable housing.

878
01:27:23,626 --> 01:27:27,787
[SPEAKER_44]: This building is vastly out of scale with our neighborhood, as others have said.

879
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:38,471
[SPEAKER_44]: We are a neighborhood of triple deckers and small bungalows, and this will have a huge impact with shadows, light pollution, not just from windows, but from bright lights on the buildings.

880
01:27:38,531 --> 01:27:41,192
[SPEAKER_44]: I see that coming in my window all night.

881
01:27:41,212 --> 01:27:44,153
[SPEAKER_44]: It is already a huge issue.

882
01:27:45,853 --> 01:27:50,415
[SPEAKER_44]: Boston, I've lacked street trees for over a mile, so I'm happy to see the trees in there.

883
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:53,396
[SPEAKER_44]: I really want to see a true commitment to that.

884
01:27:54,095 --> 01:27:58,839
[SPEAKER_44]: shade trees native trees, not calorie pairs, please.

885
01:28:03,122 --> 01:28:17,673
[SPEAKER_44]: Really importantly, the city, you have all said and this is wonderful that you support this project, because it frees up existing housing throughout the city for working families which is a great thing, but

886
01:28:18,783 --> 01:28:22,546
[SPEAKER_44]: Rents for most of the apartments around here are market rate.

887
01:28:23,026 --> 01:28:28,770
[SPEAKER_44]: That is unaffordable for many families, especially those headed by single parents.

888
01:28:29,731 --> 01:28:34,174
[SPEAKER_44]: Students can live as roommates and together they can pay thousands of dollars in rent.

889
01:28:34,194 --> 01:28:36,355
[SPEAKER_44]: That's not an option for many people.

890
01:28:37,296 --> 01:28:43,340
[SPEAKER_44]: And while additional housing stock may help to alleviate

891
01:28:43,982 --> 01:28:49,985
[SPEAKER_44]: that a little bit, I'm skeptical that it will be enough for too many families.

892
01:28:50,726 --> 01:29:02,833
[SPEAKER_44]: So, I really want Medford to be looking at how this project and other projects impact affordable housing, hold Tufts accountable for being part of that plan.

893
01:29:04,174 --> 01:29:09,196
[SPEAKER_44]: And I also just want to say, thank you.

894
01:29:10,857 --> 01:29:11,798
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you very much.

895
01:29:15,005 --> 01:29:19,846
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker hasn't posted a real name.

896
01:29:21,266 --> 01:29:24,927
[SPEAKER_24]: I will click unmute, but please share your real name.

897
01:29:31,688 --> 01:29:33,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my name is Noel Xavier.

898
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:36,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an organizer for the Carpenters Union.

899
01:29:36,989 --> 01:29:40,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I am representing over 200 members who are residents of Medford.

900
01:29:42,148 --> 01:29:50,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here tonight to express serious concerns about the upcoming Tufts Residence Hall project, where Erland Construction is set to serve as the general contractor.

901
01:29:51,517 --> 01:29:56,502
[SPEAKER_05]: While we support the building of much-needed housing, we want to ensure it's built responsibly.

902
01:29:57,643 --> 01:30:06,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Erland has a troubling history of working with subcontractors who fail to pay fair wages and that operate in the underground economy by exploiting their workforce.

903
01:30:07,393 --> 01:30:15,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, despite discussions with Tufts about these issues, they have shown little regard for taking meaningful action to address them.

904
01:30:15,956 --> 01:30:23,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, we're in the process of helping workers who have not been paid for work they performed on a Bowdoin construction project in North Attleboro.

905
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:28,360
[SPEAKER_05]: These workers were employed by a drywall subcontractor named Dynamic Interiors.

906
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:36,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Both Bowdoin Construction and Dynamic Interiors are currently working at the project on campus named Blakely Hall.

907
01:30:37,354 --> 01:30:44,782
[SPEAKER_05]: This kind of waste theft not only harms the affected workers, but also undermines the integrity of our local labor market and community standards.

908
01:30:45,823 --> 01:30:49,967
[SPEAKER_05]: As Medford residents and workers, we worry about the impact this project will have on our community.

909
01:30:50,608 --> 01:30:59,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Projects like this can either uplift neighborhoods by creating good jobs and fair opportunities, or harm them when contractors cut corners at the expense of workers and local businesses.

910
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:07,906
[SPEAKER_05]: It's critical that Tufts and the contractor selected prioritize fair treatment, diversity, safety, and accountability.

911
01:31:08,366 --> 01:31:15,152
[SPEAKER_05]: This board has the ability to set expectations for development in Medford that support ethical labor practices and strengthen our community.

912
01:31:15,672 --> 01:31:24,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I urge you to use your oversight to ensure that this project will be built with contractors who respect workers, pay fair wages, and reflect the values of this city.

913
01:31:25,241 --> 01:31:26,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your time and consideration.

914
01:31:27,534 --> 01:31:29,377
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you very much, Mr. Xavier.

915
01:31:29,478 --> 01:31:39,356
[SPEAKER_39]: One of the things I want to make clear is in this project, Rocco, you can feel free to defer this, but is your contract.

916
01:31:40,338 --> 01:31:43,362
[SPEAKER_39]: actually procured through a proper means.

917
01:31:44,203 --> 01:31:54,475
[SPEAKER_39]: The board has no control over selection of contractors, but I wanted to just make sure that we were on the same page with understanding that there's a procurement process.

918
01:31:54,835 --> 01:32:00,482
[SPEAKER_39]: There's Massachusetts laws that are followed, and I just wanted to make sure that we got that clear.

919
01:32:02,606 --> 01:32:04,467
[SPEAKER_30]: I appreciate that, Madam Chair.

920
01:32:04,827 --> 01:32:12,449
[SPEAKER_30]: And yeah, what I want to say here, I want to defer to Barb Stein, who's our Vice President of Operations.

921
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:17,171
[SPEAKER_30]: Barb, if you can raise your hand, and I will try to unmute you.

922
01:32:17,191 --> 01:32:26,694
[SPEAKER_30]: And you can talk about how we select our contractors and then the requirements we put on them.

923
01:32:28,014 --> 01:32:28,854
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure, sure.

924
01:32:29,114 --> 01:32:29,855
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm happy to do that.

925
01:32:31,257 --> 01:32:33,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, I'm Barb Stein from TUS.

926
01:32:33,778 --> 01:32:34,738
[SPEAKER_21]: Happy to be here tonight.

927
01:32:35,778 --> 01:32:38,259
[SPEAKER_21]: Regarding represented workers in the procurement process.

928
01:32:38,659 --> 01:32:44,121
[SPEAKER_21]: So Capstone was competitively procured and their team competitively procured.

929
01:32:44,681 --> 01:32:48,562
[SPEAKER_21]: So Erland Construction was competitively procured to be working on this job.

930
01:32:48,662 --> 01:32:56,305
[SPEAKER_21]: And then they in turn will competitively procure all of the subcontractors and sub-bids that work on the project.

931
01:32:56,985 --> 01:32:58,986
[SPEAKER_21]: And we do have,

932
01:33:00,467 --> 01:33:02,108
[SPEAKER_21]: union workers on campus.

933
01:33:03,349 --> 01:33:14,818
[SPEAKER_21]: For all our projects, this one and all our other projects, we do competitively bid the work and we're open to talking with and taking bids from all qualified subcontractors.

934
01:33:15,558 --> 01:33:16,599
[SPEAKER_21]: Erland is here tonight.

935
01:33:16,759 --> 01:33:20,822
[SPEAKER_21]: They've encouraged interested firms to talk to them about bidding on this project.

936
01:33:20,922 --> 01:33:24,165
[SPEAKER_21]: So please contact them if you're interested in doing so.

937
01:33:24,185 --> 01:33:26,847
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'll stop there.

938
01:33:27,225 --> 01:33:28,826
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much for that information.

939
01:33:28,867 --> 01:33:29,907
[SPEAKER_39]: I really appreciate it.

940
01:33:29,968 --> 01:33:35,433
[SPEAKER_39]: I didn't mean to take a derail from the conversations that we were having, but I know that that was a huge concern.

941
01:33:38,115 --> 01:33:39,456
[SPEAKER_39]: Director Hunt, please continue.

942
01:33:40,377 --> 01:33:40,757
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

943
01:33:40,777 --> 01:33:42,299
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

944
01:33:42,759 --> 01:33:46,543
[SPEAKER_24]: Our next commenter is Lisa DiMatteo.

945
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello everyone.

946
01:33:53,481 --> 01:33:54,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

947
01:33:54,542 --> 01:34:08,094
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Lisa D Mateo I live at 138 Brookings Street, and I am the very last house on the dead end directly abutting the project site.

948
01:34:10,254 --> 01:34:19,621
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not sure that I can add anything unique to what has already been stated in many different ways tonight.

949
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:31,369
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's also clear that this project isn't going to satisfy everybody and there isn't a way to mitigate for all the

950
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:36,711
[SPEAKER_14]: situations that are being brought forth here.

951
01:34:38,512 --> 01:34:57,438
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm just going to go ahead and be really self-focused here and describe how the buildings that are already there impact the neighborhood and at least, like,

952
01:34:58,923 --> 01:35:07,667
[SPEAKER_14]: I can be in my bed and see directly what's happening in the dormitory across the street as it exists today.

953
01:35:08,727 --> 01:35:17,671
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that these new buildings are going to be made with different materials, up-to-date technology and construction.

954
01:35:21,104 --> 01:35:34,211
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a really, really direct harmful impact to residents downhill from the proposed construction site.

955
01:35:35,131 --> 01:35:35,491
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um.

956
01:35:36,972 --> 01:35:38,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Other people have used different words for it.

957
01:35:39,694 --> 01:35:47,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to say, I think it's, it's going to have a very unhealthy impact on the neighborhood.

958
01:35:48,038 --> 01:36:00,265
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really hope that all of the parties that are being asked to consider these comments will really will really do so with care.

959
01:36:01,126 --> 01:36:04,808
[SPEAKER_14]: And for the sake of more than

960
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:11,653
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's time for the sake of our community.

961
01:36:11,713 --> 01:36:12,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Danielle.

962
01:36:17,514 --> 01:36:20,795
[SPEAKER_24]: The next commenter is Ross Simons.

963
01:36:31,197 --> 01:36:31,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Larry.

964
01:36:31,817 --> 01:36:32,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me?

965
01:36:33,518 --> 01:36:33,678
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

966
01:36:35,418 --> 01:36:36,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey there, my name is Ross Simons.

967
01:36:36,778 --> 01:36:42,700
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a long time resident about seven years now here in Method, about three blocks down from the Tufts campus.

968
01:36:44,541 --> 01:36:47,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Just want to lobby my support for the building.

969
01:36:47,982 --> 01:36:53,283
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to improve housing prices overall for renters that are not part of Tufts campus.

970
01:36:54,123 --> 01:36:59,405
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the parking side, just want to point out that the parking minimum waiver that's been going around

971
01:37:01,135 --> 01:37:09,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Four of the lowest car ownership campuses in the entire United States are in Massachusetts, with 6% or below.

972
01:37:09,497 --> 01:37:11,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Tufts' own data says only 10%.

973
01:37:13,538 --> 01:37:19,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Only 10% of their students have parking minimums, and the proposed building has

974
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:27,588
[SPEAKER_13]: they want to do a 15% parking for the dormitory that's being added.

975
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:37,473
[SPEAKER_13]: So in my opinion, that's more than enough parking for that, and I would hate for the dorm to be restricted in some way because of that minimum.

976
01:37:42,156 --> 01:37:42,996
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

977
01:37:43,376 --> 01:37:43,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

978
01:37:45,778 --> 01:37:48,339
[SPEAKER_24]: The next commenter is Elizabeth Bale.

979
01:37:54,562 --> 01:37:56,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, can you hear me?

980
01:37:57,763 --> 01:37:59,164
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, but there's an echo.

981
01:37:59,224 --> 01:38:01,304
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm not sure if you're on two different devices.

982
01:38:01,324 --> 01:38:03,545
[SPEAKER_22]: How about now, is that better?

983
01:38:04,065 --> 01:38:09,727
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

984
01:38:13,108 --> 01:38:14,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, just a second.

985
01:38:20,210 --> 01:38:21,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I hope you can hear me now.

986
01:38:23,047 --> 01:38:23,848
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we can hear you.

987
01:38:23,888 --> 01:38:25,609
[SPEAKER_22]: If you could state your name and your address.

988
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:35,438
[SPEAKER_22]: Elizabeth Bale, 34 Emery Street, which is a few streets over from the proposed site.

989
01:38:35,819 --> 01:38:45,468
[SPEAKER_22]: And I learned of this project only on October 28th, and I do try to follow

990
01:38:47,246 --> 01:39:00,133
[SPEAKER_22]: what Tufts is doing but I feel like I think some in some of the letters that may have been stated that for something this size and magnitude and impact on the neighborhood.

991
01:39:00,673 --> 01:39:04,836
[SPEAKER_22]: It certainly would have been really nice, and I wish it was required.

992
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:20,003
[SPEAKER_22]: that Tufts could have sent letters around or in some other way informed people who live in Medford Hillside, because this is really going to have, to me, a hugely negative impact.

993
01:39:20,764 --> 01:39:31,909
[SPEAKER_22]: We've worked with Tufts for years over various issues, and we've asked for housing on campus because we have negative impacts from students living off campus.

994
01:39:35,309 --> 01:39:52,720
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we've participated in asking for mitigation on other projects, but it's I just want to echo the comments of everyone who said that these are way too huge and tall for the scale of the neighborhood and they're going to permanently damage.

995
01:39:53,440 --> 01:40:15,832
[SPEAKER_22]: the neighborhood and I don't understand why they can't take advantage of buildings that they have control over or own like hillside hardware and other sites to make either several lower buildings or make these buildings lower and take advantage of other opportunities because these are

996
01:40:18,664 --> 01:40:21,505
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just really horrified at the scale of them.

997
01:40:21,745 --> 01:40:28,527
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have really appreciated Medford Hillside and worked hard to get the T station here.

998
01:40:28,747 --> 01:40:36,269
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't wanna see this whole neighborhood ruined by these colossal buildings.

999
01:40:36,889 --> 01:40:37,269
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1000
01:40:37,289 --> 01:40:39,930
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

1001
01:40:42,330 --> 01:40:44,231
[SPEAKER_24]: Our next speaker is Ian Hines.

1002
01:40:45,185 --> 01:40:46,826
[SPEAKER_24]: Oops, I think I may have clicked the wrong one.

1003
01:40:47,326 --> 01:40:48,847
[SPEAKER_24]: Ian Hines, there you go.

1004
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:50,348
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, thank you.

1005
01:40:51,808 --> 01:40:52,709
[SPEAKER_28]: So my name is Ian Hines.

1006
01:40:52,869 --> 01:40:58,692
[SPEAKER_28]: I am also with the Carpenters Union, and I just wanted to echo what my brother Noel was saying before.

1007
01:40:59,292 --> 01:41:02,374
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, follow up on what Ms.

1008
01:41:02,394 --> 01:41:10,058
[SPEAKER_28]: Stein and Mr. Dorrico were talking about, about the qualified contractors and how this process has been working.

1009
01:41:10,078 --> 01:41:13,460
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, to my understanding, this is a private development,

1010
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:23,288
[SPEAKER_28]: which means that it is exempt from a lot of the protections we typically have on public projects for universities such as Tufts or in the past.

1011
01:41:23,568 --> 01:41:31,414
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, what that means for us is that we have no general contractual liability in Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1012
01:41:32,175 --> 01:41:41,238
[SPEAKER_28]: that it essentially entails you can hide behind, as a general contractor, the actions of your subcontractors.

1013
01:41:41,618 --> 01:41:45,139
[SPEAKER_28]: And those actions are typically not documented.

1014
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:56,902
[SPEAKER_28]: So when Noel is talking about who we have been chasing after, who we've seen as bad actors in this industry ending up on these projects, just because they can be qualified through the state's

1015
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:02,681
[SPEAKER_28]: Parameters does not mean that they are not bad actors.

1016
01:42:04,922 --> 01:42:09,824
[SPEAKER_28]: So I would just advise and please request and someone who my whole family's from Medford.

1017
01:42:10,064 --> 01:42:23,190
[SPEAKER_28]: I was born in Medford, raised my first few years of my life in Medford and still there plenty of times and also represent those 200 workers that live in the city and more who will work there.

1018
01:42:24,778 --> 01:42:36,129
[SPEAKER_28]: please understand this part of the issue because there are too many ways that those cheating contractors are getting into these projects.

1019
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:37,470
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1020
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:44,116
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1021
01:42:45,077 --> 01:42:48,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Our next commenter is Kelly and Claire Rhodes.

1022
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hi, my name is Kelly Rhodes.

1023
01:42:51,001 --> 01:42:53,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm representing myself and my wife, Claire Rhodes.

1024
01:42:53,781 --> 01:42:58,183
[SPEAKER_01]: We live at 83 Charnwood Road with a lot of our neighbors here as well.

1025
01:42:58,983 --> 01:43:14,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just want to reiterate what Jeremy said so eloquently as well as our neighbors, Lisa, who we live right across the street from, impacted greatly on this, and Georgie, who discussed the letters that we've written and that we really would love to have a lot of attention brought to.

1026
01:43:16,548 --> 01:43:28,953
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems as though Tufts, as a connector to our community, they really pride themselves on their work with our community to bridge a gap between the university and our neighborhood.

1027
01:43:29,533 --> 01:43:31,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And this seems to go completely against it.

1028
01:43:32,854 --> 01:43:41,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I also just learned about this recently and we are extremely connected and all of the ways that you can be connected both through Tufts University as well as Medford.

1029
01:43:41,743 --> 01:43:50,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm also saying, you know, shame on Medford because I think that you could have done a really better job informing your neighbors that are going to be directly impacted on this.

1030
01:43:51,032 --> 01:44:03,518
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems that this is probably going to go through the way that Tufts is going to see that they want it to, and that these neighbor concerns might not have any impact.

1031
01:44:04,119 --> 01:44:20,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I would ask that you all treat these neighbors with respect, because they're coming at you with sincere and dire concerns over the impact that this will bring, not only currently to our daily lives, but in the future, two to five to ten years from now,

1032
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:22,791
[SPEAKER_01]: as many of us have been in this community a long time.

1033
01:44:23,051 --> 01:44:23,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1034
01:44:25,095 --> 01:44:25,616
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1035
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,587
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Jason Jolcinet.

1036
01:44:35,173 --> 01:44:35,814
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, good evening.

1037
01:44:35,874 --> 01:44:37,335
[SPEAKER_43]: My name is Jason Wilson.

1038
01:44:37,496 --> 01:44:41,840
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm a 25 year resident here in Somerville, and I'm with carpenters local 328.

1039
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:55,594
[SPEAKER_43]: And as someone I'm going to practice, by the way, and as someone who's worked on both sides, non union and union, I just can't speak enough to how much more protections that you need membership brings.

1040
01:44:56,435 --> 01:45:00,196
[SPEAKER_43]: and the quality and the training it brings along with to the work that's being done.

1041
01:45:00,216 --> 01:45:12,000
[SPEAKER_43]: Tufts kind of just passing off saying we have open bids and we're willing to talk to the union doesn't really show support or push for union work on the site.

1042
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:16,762
[SPEAKER_43]: It's just kind of like I said before, a race to the bottom with the work that may be done.

1043
01:45:17,782 --> 01:45:32,409
[SPEAKER_43]: And, you know, I just think you could really do better for the community and the people that live here and that work here, you know, and just support us in our efforts to get ahead in the world with the right protections at work.

1044
01:45:33,129 --> 01:45:38,171
[SPEAKER_43]: And I just hope you can, you know, get behind this properly and do the right thing.

1045
01:45:38,512 --> 01:45:39,112
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you very much.

1046
01:45:41,233 --> 01:45:41,693
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1047
01:45:48,205 --> 01:45:51,311
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, I got called away.

1048
01:45:51,391 --> 01:45:54,257
[SPEAKER_24]: Is the next speaker Richard Lavoie or is that who just spoke?

1049
01:45:55,359 --> 01:45:56,181
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the next speaker.

1050
01:45:56,201 --> 01:45:56,261
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1051
01:46:07,552 --> 01:46:08,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, hello.

1052
01:46:09,473 --> 01:46:11,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm Rich Lavoie.

1053
01:46:12,175 --> 01:46:16,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a lifelong resident of Medford here at Sheridan Ave.

1054
01:46:17,357 --> 01:46:21,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am also a representative of the Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen.

1055
01:46:22,617 --> 01:46:24,538
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have just two questions.

1056
01:46:24,898 --> 01:46:30,921
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the financial relationship between Capstone Partners and Tufts University?

1057
01:46:32,081 --> 01:46:37,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And also has Capstone publicly committed to not making a profit on this project?

1058
01:46:39,425 --> 01:46:41,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So look forward to hearing the answer.

1059
01:46:41,426 --> 01:46:41,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1060
01:46:42,726 --> 01:46:43,607
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you very much.

1061
01:46:45,447 --> 01:46:50,890
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Jeff Saliba.

1062
01:46:55,641 --> 01:46:56,402
[SPEAKER_34]: Evening everyone.

1063
01:46:56,742 --> 01:46:58,063
[SPEAKER_34]: My name is Jeff Saliba.

1064
01:46:58,463 --> 01:47:02,526
[SPEAKER_34]: I am the business manager of the heat and frost insulators local six.

1065
01:47:03,427 --> 01:47:07,090
[SPEAKER_34]: I represent around 600 mechanical insulators with many of them.

1066
01:47:07,909 --> 01:47:09,790
[SPEAKER_34]: And I mean many of them living in Bedford.

1067
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:13,492
[SPEAKER_34]: Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one in that unit that doesn't live in Bedford.

1068
01:47:14,092 --> 01:47:16,974
[SPEAKER_34]: But I want to touch on wage theft.

1069
01:47:17,214 --> 01:47:33,222
[SPEAKER_34]: The construction industry is plagued by rampant wage theft, a practice that exploits workers and siphons billions of dollars annually with Massachusetts alone, seeing an estimated $1 billion stolen from workers each year, according to the Massachusetts AFL-CIO.

1070
01:47:33,983 --> 01:47:37,960
[SPEAKER_34]: Unscrupulous subcontractors frequently misclassify workers.

1071
01:47:38,861 --> 01:47:47,163
[SPEAKER_34]: underpay wages, deny them sick time, deny them overtime, or fail to pay workers altogether, creating a systematic crisis of exploitation.

1072
01:47:47,623 --> 01:48:00,207
[SPEAKER_34]: Institutions like Tufts University and contractors like Early Construction bear a moral and perhaps legal responsibility to ensure that workers on their properties are paid fairly and in compliance with the law.

1073
01:48:00,787 --> 01:48:07,269
[SPEAKER_34]: Turning a blind eye to the practices of subcontractors and claiming no responsibility for their actions is not only

1074
01:48:08,029 --> 01:48:10,931
[SPEAKER_34]: complicit, but perpetuates the cycle of abuse.

1075
01:48:11,351 --> 01:48:21,278
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe the only reliable way to safeguard workers' wages and uphold ethical standards is to hire union contractors.

1076
01:48:21,678 --> 01:48:31,985
[SPEAKER_34]: Union contractors ensure transparency, accountability, and adherence to wage and labor laws, guaranteeing that workers are paid fairly and treated with dignity on every job.

1077
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:33,506
[SPEAKER_34]: And I appreciate your time.

1078
01:48:33,646 --> 01:48:34,006
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1079
01:48:34,026 --> 01:48:36,268
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you very much.

1080
01:48:39,092 --> 01:48:41,996
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Mike Korzynski.

1081
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:45,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1082
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:49,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I submitted written comments, so I will just be brief.

1083
01:48:51,018 --> 01:48:56,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Judy Weinstock, my neighbor, had brought up a point earlier about how these are 12-month leases.

1084
01:48:56,582 --> 01:49:07,571
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know Alicia had mentioned to start off the meeting that they had checked with their legal team, I guess, about, of course, I don't think any reasonable person would say a dorm is not protected under Dover.

1085
01:49:08,151 --> 01:49:15,617
[SPEAKER_06]: But this project sounds a lot more like the escape development that they tried to do in Conway and tried to do in Davis Square, and both of those failed.

1086
01:49:15,717 --> 01:49:16,697
[SPEAKER_06]: And neither one of those was

1087
01:49:17,638 --> 01:49:26,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Would have obviously been entitled to do over because they're essentially for profit projects and if you if you really think about how the storm is going to operate and be operated by capstone not by toughs.

1088
01:49:27,442 --> 01:49:33,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds a lot more like a for profit project than than a dormitory and I think if you ask those questions.

1089
01:49:35,584 --> 01:49:41,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's a more interesting answer than just a reasonable person would say university dormitory is protected by Dover.

1090
01:49:42,009 --> 01:49:43,730
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think there's deeper questions to be asked.

1091
01:49:44,071 --> 01:49:53,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would implore you all to read submitted written comments because I think that they try to go into more detail and get to the nuance of some of this.

1092
01:49:53,438 --> 01:49:55,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also support everything

1093
01:49:56,740 --> 01:50:08,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeremy and Laurie said as well, and I do think that this project, we support a dorm in general, but this particular version of it is just not right or fair for the neighborhood.

1094
01:50:08,991 --> 01:50:09,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

1095
01:50:15,096 --> 01:50:15,597
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1096
01:50:17,038 --> 01:50:19,220
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Laura Jasinski.

1097
01:50:21,038 --> 01:50:21,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everybody.

1098
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:23,338
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Laura Jasinski.

1099
01:50:23,418 --> 01:50:25,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 65 Burgett Ave.

1100
01:50:25,639 --> 01:50:27,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also a member of the Medford Arts Council.

1101
01:50:27,539 --> 01:50:49,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a member of the Medford Comprehensive Master Plan Steering Committee, and I'm also a proud double jumbo, so say that to note that I care about the success of Tufts, but very much care about the success of Medford, and want to be one more voice in appealing to this board to use every tool in your power to provide the level of review that the project of this scale really requires.

1102
01:50:50,564 --> 01:51:06,443
[SPEAKER_09]: We've heard a lot of concerns tonight I echo those concerns around building height and mitigation, and also just recognize this as I think an opportunity for tops but really an opportunity for Medford and we're setting a precedent with this building and we need to be very do that with care I think someone said that really nicely.

1103
01:51:08,085 --> 01:51:20,897
[SPEAKER_09]: So have a lot of concerns around, again, the impacts of this will have on the neighborhood and ask TEPs to really show up as a true partner with the community, use this as an opportunity to build a bridge and not to build a wall.

1104
01:51:21,197 --> 01:51:21,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1105
01:51:25,361 --> 01:51:29,785
[SPEAKER_24]: The last, almost last, the next speaker is Chatten Green.

1106
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:38,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, everyone.

1107
01:51:38,631 --> 01:51:39,832
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Shaton Green.

1108
01:51:40,432 --> 01:51:42,454
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm an agent with the Boston Building Trades Union.

1109
01:51:42,474 --> 01:51:44,775
[SPEAKER_12]: I represent hundreds of workers in Medford.

1110
01:51:45,476 --> 01:51:53,901
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really want to open with a quote, and it's, no one who works for a living should live in poverty.

1111
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:59,582
[SPEAKER_12]: Before joining the union, I've worked non-union and experienced wage theft myself.

1112
01:52:00,143 --> 01:52:03,725
[SPEAKER_12]: And it literally almost displaced me out of my neighborhood, out of my home.

1113
01:52:04,385 --> 01:52:10,809
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't until I joined the union and had those protections that I was able to really grow roots in my neighborhood.

1114
01:52:10,869 --> 01:52:14,391
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know this is the same for many, many members who we represent.

1115
01:52:15,992 --> 01:52:20,774
[SPEAKER_12]: So my question for the board is what is your policy to combat wage theft in Method?

1116
01:52:20,794 --> 01:52:24,957
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1117
01:52:27,731 --> 01:52:30,452
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Eric Etienne.

1118
01:52:37,716 --> 01:52:38,996
[SPEAKER_39]: Eric, you're muted.

1119
01:52:43,278 --> 01:52:44,599
[SPEAKER_39]: Are you able to unmute yourself?

1120
01:52:53,303 --> 01:52:53,503
[SPEAKER_39]: Nope.

1121
01:52:56,363 --> 01:52:59,244
[SPEAKER_39]: Alicia, can you help him with technical difficulties?

1122
01:53:00,184 --> 01:53:01,144
[SPEAKER_38]: There, he's unmuted.

1123
01:53:01,224 --> 01:53:03,685
[SPEAKER_38]: I think there's too many people trying to unmute at the same time.

1124
01:53:03,705 --> 01:53:14,127
[SPEAKER_24]: If one person handles it, then... Do you want me to send him the unmute request again?

1125
01:53:15,187 --> 01:53:19,748
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, nobody, no one who's a co-host, please don't... Hello?

1126
01:53:20,747 --> 01:53:21,187
[SPEAKER_39]: Hello.

1127
01:53:21,607 --> 01:53:22,407
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, can you hear me?

1128
01:53:22,908 --> 01:53:23,168
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1129
01:53:23,708 --> 01:53:25,908
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, my name is Eric Etienne.

1130
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:28,909
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm a long life resident of Method.

1131
01:53:28,969 --> 01:53:30,770
[SPEAKER_27]: I live at 117 Princeton Street.

1132
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:34,010
[SPEAKER_27]: My backyard was actually Spicer Field.

1133
01:53:35,231 --> 01:53:40,272
[SPEAKER_27]: I am a highly trained union mechanical insulator and I would like the opportunity to work in the city I live in.

1134
01:53:40,955 --> 01:53:51,902
[SPEAKER_27]: Unfortunately, too many times these contractors who work on these job sites that tops higher workers who live in other cities and towns, and many times from New Hampshire, or from a Home Depot parking lot.

1135
01:53:52,442 --> 01:54:05,570
[SPEAKER_27]: But it was it was emphasized here to the importance of insulation at a friend of mine working on a building that's how sent me some pictures of inferior insulation work and untrained insulator attempted to install in a building.

1136
01:54:06,211 --> 01:54:11,169
[SPEAKER_27]: It was brought to the engineering department's attention with a contract that was made to re-insulate the piping.

1137
01:54:11,769 --> 01:54:21,615
[SPEAKER_27]: Hiring trained mechanical insulators is not just an investment in the quality of the building, it is an investment in the environment and the future of train potential.

1138
01:54:22,095 --> 01:54:31,280
[SPEAKER_27]: Ensure that insulation is installed correctly, maximizing energy efficiency, reducing waste, and minimizing carbon emissions.

1139
01:54:31,841 --> 01:54:39,205
[SPEAKER_27]: In contrast, untrained workers compromise these benefits, leading to higher costs, greater environmental harm,

1140
01:54:39,785 --> 01:54:43,126
[SPEAKER_27]: and missed opportunities for substantial development.

1141
01:54:43,486 --> 01:54:54,230
[SPEAKER_27]: Builders and contractors must prioritize prioritize hiring qualified professionals to ensure their projects are both economically and environmentally sound.

1142
01:54:55,990 --> 01:54:58,211
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd love the opportunity to work in this building.

1143
01:54:58,911 --> 01:55:00,712
[SPEAKER_27]: Please, please do the right thing.

1144
01:55:01,092 --> 01:55:01,472
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1145
01:55:03,173 --> 01:55:04,193
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1146
01:55:05,412 --> 01:55:08,373
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Chair, I'm gonna keep calling on people.

1147
01:55:08,513 --> 01:55:17,296
[SPEAKER_24]: I just thought I should clarify in case anybody is confused about this, but the board doesn't have any authority or anything over labor contracts.

1148
01:55:17,356 --> 01:55:19,597
[SPEAKER_24]: They can't require anything around labor.

1149
01:55:20,537 --> 01:55:22,458
[SPEAKER_24]: It's completely outside of their scope.

1150
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:32,542
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just don't want the abutters and the other neighbors listening, thinking that we're ignoring it, but the board cannot include that in their conditions.

1151
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:38,462
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, and I was going to clarify that at the end of the public comment period.

1152
01:55:38,702 --> 01:55:46,265
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much, Director Hunt, for saying that, that we're only limited to two specifications, and I will reiterate those later.

1153
01:55:46,285 --> 01:55:47,826
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

1154
01:55:47,866 --> 01:55:50,367
[SPEAKER_24]: So the next speaker is Rick Keogh.

1155
01:56:01,351 --> 01:56:02,192
[SPEAKER_45]: It's Rick Keogh.

1156
01:56:02,212 --> 01:56:02,772
[SPEAKER_45]: Can you hear me now?

1157
01:56:03,478 --> 01:56:03,978
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah.

1158
01:56:04,959 --> 01:56:07,000
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm not, I actually don't live in Medford.

1159
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:10,541
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm a sheet metal representative for the sheet metal work at Local 17.

1160
01:56:11,102 --> 01:56:13,483
[SPEAKER_45]: And I actually, I'm in that area all the time.

1161
01:56:13,543 --> 01:56:20,126
[SPEAKER_45]: I have, you know, members that live in Medford, and I also have family members that live in Medford, and they'll be sending in their emails.

1162
01:56:20,326 --> 01:56:21,067
[SPEAKER_45]: But, um,

1163
01:56:22,167 --> 01:56:23,228
[SPEAKER_45]: just want to mediate.

1164
01:56:23,268 --> 01:56:26,689
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm not going to go on just like the other building trades because I don't think trust itself.

1165
01:56:26,729 --> 01:56:28,450
[SPEAKER_45]: Tufts used to be a very honorable school.

1166
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:29,691
[SPEAKER_45]: They really don't care.

1167
01:56:29,731 --> 01:56:32,212
[SPEAKER_45]: It's all about the profit now, as you can tell by the building.

1168
01:56:32,532 --> 01:56:34,433
[SPEAKER_45]: These buildings are there just strictly for profit.

1169
01:56:35,573 --> 01:56:41,996
[SPEAKER_45]: But as far as I'm concerned, driving down, they're adding a 10-story building with commercial property at the bottom, and I'm driving down there all the time.

1170
01:56:42,056 --> 01:56:44,417
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't know how many times a biker almost hits my door.

1171
01:56:45,618 --> 01:56:48,339
[SPEAKER_45]: It's dangerous enough, and you're wiping out the parking.

1172
01:56:48,459 --> 01:56:49,280
[SPEAKER_45]: I mean, maybe you should

1173
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:54,263
[SPEAKER_45]: should maybe eliminate one of the buildings or something or lower the buildings, like they said.

1174
01:56:54,303 --> 01:57:01,769
[SPEAKER_45]: But I know when you're going to have the spring people moving in and, you know, and moving out in the spring and moving in in the fall.

1175
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:04,391
[SPEAKER_45]: I said it's dangerous enough.

1176
01:57:04,431 --> 01:57:06,713
[SPEAKER_45]: I really think I think these neighbors are right.

1177
01:57:07,073 --> 01:57:08,114
[SPEAKER_45]: You're asking for trouble.

1178
01:57:08,574 --> 01:57:13,879
[SPEAKER_45]: They've had enough accidents there already with the, you know, people getting hurt and sent to the hospital lately.

1179
01:57:14,119 --> 01:57:15,720
[SPEAKER_45]: So I don't think you need more.

1180
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:16,380
[SPEAKER_45]: And I would really

1181
01:57:17,141 --> 01:57:18,802
[SPEAKER_45]: Let's speak against this project totally.

1182
01:57:18,842 --> 01:57:22,544
[SPEAKER_45]: So just like my point of view, very dangerous.

1183
01:57:22,924 --> 01:57:23,364
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

1184
01:57:26,406 --> 01:57:29,727
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is City Council President Zach bears.

1185
01:57:31,808 --> 01:57:32,269
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi everyone.

1186
01:57:32,369 --> 01:57:32,769
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1187
01:57:33,938 --> 01:57:35,719
[SPEAKER_25]: to the chair and the Community Development Board.

1188
01:57:35,739 --> 01:57:43,244
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to thank residents for their feedback and concerns, some of which we have heard as city councilors as well, and I've been listening tonight.

1189
01:57:44,365 --> 01:57:51,469
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to speak mostly to Tufts at this point, given what we know about the law.

1190
01:57:51,489 --> 01:57:56,973
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of what we've been advocating for from the city council perspective and state legislators

1191
01:57:58,647 --> 01:58:10,352
[SPEAKER_25]: exist because we don't feel that there's a fair balance of power between the city and the residents and Dover exempt institutions like Tufts and other institutions in the education and health space.

1192
01:58:11,152 --> 01:58:13,914
[SPEAKER_25]: And I really want to encourage Tufts to use this as an opportunity

1193
01:58:15,174 --> 01:58:16,836
[SPEAKER_25]: to build some of that connection.

1194
01:58:16,856 --> 01:58:18,877
[SPEAKER_25]: I see a lot of the benefits here.

1195
01:58:18,937 --> 01:58:20,159
[SPEAKER_25]: The housing shortage is real.

1196
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:35,833
[SPEAKER_25]: We want more students on campus housed at Tufts, but I think Tufts could use this as an opportunity to build some connection, even though they're not legally required to, by accepting a voluntary site plan review beyond just the Dover site plan review.

1197
01:58:37,114 --> 01:58:43,085
[SPEAKER_25]: looking at a pilot payment similar to the Cummings Center, an additional pilot beyond what is provided to the city, more

1198
01:58:46,396 --> 01:58:53,598
[SPEAKER_25]: concretely committing to working with the building trades and other union contractors to ensure fair labor on the project.

1199
01:58:54,858 --> 01:59:13,143
[SPEAKER_25]: And I also want to just thank the CD board for their work on this and hopefully given the difficult legal conditions that exist there can be additional public realm improvements on traffic safety and trees on Boston Avenue as well as light and sound mitigation.

1200
01:59:13,623 --> 01:59:14,883
[SPEAKER_25]: But again I just think this is an

1201
01:59:15,323 --> 01:59:18,284
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, there's a reason why we're filing the institutional master plan bill.

1202
01:59:18,644 --> 01:59:21,205
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a reason why I support pilot bills at the State House.

1203
01:59:21,265 --> 01:59:30,848
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think it's because we just see how limited municipalities are with the Dover Amendment and the exemptions given to our large nonprofit educational and health care institutions.

1204
01:59:30,969 --> 01:59:37,791
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm asking Tufts to use this as an opportunity to work differently and maybe go beyond just what they're required to do.

1205
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:38,531
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1206
01:59:42,633 --> 01:59:43,573
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much.

1207
01:59:44,397 --> 01:59:45,157
[SPEAKER_39]: President Bears.

1208
01:59:46,858 --> 01:59:49,098
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is Jim Lister.

1209
01:59:52,819 --> 01:59:53,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

1210
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:55,660
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Jim Lister.

1211
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I live 193 Winthrop Street.

1212
01:59:59,841 --> 02:00:05,063
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also with the Building Trades and I've lived in Medford most of my life.

1213
02:00:07,443 --> 02:00:13,427
[SPEAKER_08]: And it hurts me that Tufts continually snubs the building trades.

1214
02:00:14,188 --> 02:00:28,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Trained workers, you know, Tufts is a world-class school, yet they build and they scrape every dollar for what they think they're saving in their night.

1215
02:00:28,958 --> 02:00:33,341
[SPEAKER_08]: They're penny wise and dollar foolish.

1216
02:00:35,169 --> 02:00:47,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to see them commit, like any other world-class school, to build all their buildings and maintain all their buildings with the Boston Building Trades, with a collective bargaining agreement, you know?

1217
02:00:47,234 --> 02:00:58,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this board said they can't do anything about that, but we have the power in other ways to, you know, hold off until they come to their senses somewhat.

1218
02:01:01,339 --> 02:01:03,800
[SPEAKER_08]: The procurement... I don't want to say the last thing.

1219
02:01:07,225 --> 02:01:09,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, Tufts is a world-class institution.

1220
02:01:11,068 --> 02:01:12,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Wage theft is real.

1221
02:01:12,669 --> 02:01:14,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Exploitation is real.

1222
02:01:14,991 --> 02:01:16,051
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens every day.

1223
02:01:16,071 --> 02:01:17,412
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens under your nose.

1224
02:01:18,473 --> 02:01:21,255
[SPEAKER_08]: I would hope that Tufts doesn't want to be a part of that.

1225
02:01:21,636 --> 02:01:30,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I would hope that this board would better understand what the word open shop means, what the word union means, collective bargaining.

1226
02:01:30,622 --> 02:01:34,105
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to know all those things before you can make a judgment

1227
02:01:35,237 --> 02:01:38,878
[SPEAKER_08]: on giving them a building permit, giving them the rights to build a building.

1228
02:01:39,458 --> 02:01:41,899
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, exploitation is real.

1229
02:01:42,179 --> 02:01:44,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that you do a little research.

1230
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:45,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Please.

1231
02:01:46,301 --> 02:01:46,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1232
02:01:50,882 --> 02:01:52,963
[SPEAKER_24]: The next speaker is El Roco.

1233
02:01:56,494 --> 02:01:57,295
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, can you hear me?

1234
02:01:57,955 --> 02:01:58,255
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.

1235
02:01:58,756 --> 02:01:59,896
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, yes, Linda Rocco.

1236
02:01:59,936 --> 02:02:03,219
[SPEAKER_36]: I live at 15-17 University Ave.

1237
02:02:03,299 --> 02:02:04,820
[SPEAKER_36]: Just a couple of points I'm gonna make.

1238
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:14,606
[SPEAKER_36]: I find it very interesting that Tufts University is telling the Method residents that we're beginning construction on April 1st, 2025.

1239
02:02:15,287 --> 02:02:19,450
[SPEAKER_36]: I also know I have a major issue with the building height.

1240
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:21,671
[SPEAKER_36]: At one time it was seven floors.

1241
02:02:22,031 --> 02:02:23,773
[SPEAKER_36]: Now it's 10 and above.

1242
02:02:25,090 --> 02:02:27,991
[SPEAKER_36]: I have an issue with parking on University Ave.

1243
02:02:28,412 --> 02:02:36,415
[SPEAKER_36]: I noticed in one of the pictures that there was some kind of construction parking area on University Ave for construction workers.

1244
02:02:37,336 --> 02:02:43,038
[SPEAKER_36]: I'd like to know exactly where that's going to be because no one will be parking anywhere near my property.

1245
02:02:44,539 --> 02:02:54,045
[SPEAKER_36]: issue with trucks coming up and down the street of University of what type of damage is it going to be to the street of University of and who's going to repair the street.

1246
02:02:54,466 --> 02:02:57,848
[SPEAKER_36]: I have an issue with construction going six days a week.

1247
02:02:58,929 --> 02:02:59,069
[SPEAKER_36]: Um,

1248
02:03:00,044 --> 02:03:07,407
[SPEAKER_36]: I work five days a week and I certainly don't want to hear trucks coming up and down the street of University Ave on a Saturday morning.

1249
02:03:07,507 --> 02:03:20,092
[SPEAKER_36]: And the last issue I have is if and when they do break ground, the rodents, the rats and the mice that are going to be floating around University Ave, Boston Ave and God knows where.

1250
02:03:20,452 --> 02:03:21,372
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you very much.

1251
02:03:22,473 --> 02:03:22,893
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1252
02:03:27,355 --> 02:03:32,424
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm madame chair that is the last one I can check for more written comments.

1253
02:03:33,446 --> 02:03:36,551
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'd like to know if you actually I'll tell you.

1254
02:03:42,998 --> 02:03:47,080
[SPEAKER_24]: that there've been two comments that have come in since seven o'clock.

1255
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:52,221
[SPEAKER_24]: One of them was another of the form, the opposing the parking waiver.

1256
02:03:52,362 --> 02:03:57,984
[SPEAKER_24]: And the other is a message saying that they wholeheartedly support long campus housing.

1257
02:03:59,164 --> 02:04:03,806
[SPEAKER_24]: And he'd love to have more trees on Boston Ave.

1258
02:04:03,906 --> 02:04:06,747
[SPEAKER_24]: That's it for the written comments that have been received so far.

1259
02:04:08,625 --> 02:04:09,646
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much.

1260
02:04:09,706 --> 02:04:17,272
[SPEAKER_39]: Since seeing no other comments, I will close the public comment portion of the meeting and bring it back to the board for deliberation.

1261
02:04:17,713 --> 02:04:23,998
[SPEAKER_39]: Actually, before deliberation, I'm going to defer to Mr. DiRico, or would you prefer Braco?

1262
02:04:24,178 --> 02:04:28,282
[SPEAKER_39]: I have been remiss in referring to you by your first name.

1263
02:04:29,148 --> 02:04:31,229
[SPEAKER_30]: Madam Chair, everybody calls me Rocco.

1264
02:04:31,309 --> 02:04:33,770
[SPEAKER_30]: I think I'm the only Rocco at Tufts.

1265
02:04:34,450 --> 02:04:34,830
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

1266
02:04:35,070 --> 02:04:50,976
[SPEAKER_39]: There are actually two questions that I would hope that you can answer to the public, but then I would defer back to you and your partners on which others you want to address this evening, or you don't have to feel pressured to answer them all this evening?

1267
02:04:52,433 --> 02:04:55,634
[SPEAKER_39]: but the two that I would like to be answered tonight is one, Ms.

1268
02:04:55,714 --> 02:05:05,879
[SPEAKER_39]: Weinstock had referred to a discussion that she had with you regarding the apartments, if you couldn't lease them with students, they would be leased otherwise.

1269
02:05:05,919 --> 02:05:07,740
[SPEAKER_39]: Can you explain that to us a little bit more?

1270
02:05:08,926 --> 02:05:11,868
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, and that is not what I said to Ms.

1271
02:05:12,088 --> 02:05:13,689
[SPEAKER_30]: Weinstock when we met earlier this week.

1272
02:05:14,189 --> 02:05:19,112
[SPEAKER_30]: So this building is being built for Tufts University students.

1273
02:05:20,013 --> 02:05:31,179
[SPEAKER_30]: We've done a demand analysis, and there are plenty of juniors and seniors who are on our waiting list right now for on-campus housing and want to live in this dorm.

1274
02:05:31,219 --> 02:05:36,603
[SPEAKER_30]: So I want to start off by saying I have no doubt that we're going to fill this dorm with juniors and seniors.

1275
02:05:37,583 --> 02:05:48,349
[SPEAKER_30]: In the event that we can't, we will go to other Tufts students, graduate students, freshmen and sophomores, faculty and staff.

1276
02:05:48,389 --> 02:05:53,733
[SPEAKER_30]: So the only people in this building will be Tufts University affiliates, students, faculty, or staff.

1277
02:05:54,493 --> 02:05:55,814
[SPEAKER_39]: At all times, okay.

1278
02:05:57,064 --> 02:05:57,845
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you very much.

1279
02:05:57,945 --> 02:06:10,836
[SPEAKER_39]: Another question I had, going back to the light reflection, if you guys can just, there were some shadow studies that were provided, but that has been a huge concern for many of the abutters.

1280
02:06:13,238 --> 02:06:18,322
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm hoping that at some point we can mitigate some concerns with, you know, reasonable solutions going forward.

1281
02:06:18,362 --> 02:06:29,411
[SPEAKER_39]: But if you can just, if someone could touch a little bit more about exactly how those, how the windows or how it won't affect the abutters, the actual lighting.

1282
02:06:30,779 --> 02:06:35,900
[SPEAKER_30]: Sure, I want to allow David Manfredi, our architect, to speak to this a little bit.

1283
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:42,882
[SPEAKER_30]: But I do want to emphasize that I know one of the things that was brought up was low light emission windows.

1284
02:06:43,542 --> 02:06:53,824
[SPEAKER_30]: And the issue with that is, as part of the passive house standards, you need to allow light to kind of come into the building to heat a certain portion of it because you're relying on the light for it.

1285
02:06:55,024 --> 02:06:57,965
[SPEAKER_30]: So there are things we can do to try to mitigate

1286
02:06:59,065 --> 02:07:02,508
[SPEAKER_30]: Shades, blinds, other things like that, and we're going to do that.

1287
02:07:03,769 --> 02:07:08,552
[SPEAKER_30]: But there are other parts of the project that we can't because we have to meet the building code.

1288
02:07:09,652 --> 02:07:12,314
[SPEAKER_30]: David Manfredi, did I, A, did I say that correctly?

1289
02:07:12,374 --> 02:07:13,895
[SPEAKER_30]: And B, is there anything you want to add?

1290
02:07:14,716 --> 02:07:17,357
[SPEAKER_23]: No, you absolutely had it right, Rocco.

1291
02:07:18,338 --> 02:07:19,399
[SPEAKER_23]: I will reinforce that

1292
02:07:20,388 --> 02:07:29,050
[SPEAKER_23]: It is passive house, and because it is passive house, that very much limits the amount of glazing to approximately 30% of the surface area of the building.

1293
02:07:30,030 --> 02:07:36,052
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that limits the light spill that would come out of those windows.

1294
02:07:36,212 --> 02:07:41,773
[SPEAKER_23]: There will be shades on all windows.

1295
02:07:43,108 --> 02:07:53,437
[SPEAKER_23]: Obviously, they rely upon the occupant using the shades, but they will be on every window in the building.

1296
02:07:56,719 --> 02:08:03,605
[SPEAKER_23]: Glass is rated by its visible light transmission, and typically that's somewhere

1297
02:08:04,685 --> 02:08:06,146
[SPEAKER_23]: It can vary widely.

1298
02:08:06,186 --> 02:08:18,674
[SPEAKER_23]: Of course, you could get reflective glass, but I don't think you want that because that just increases the amount of daylight or sunlight that's getting reflected across the street.

1299
02:08:19,575 --> 02:08:25,719
[SPEAKER_23]: You want probably a visual light transmission that's, I don't know, I'm gonna say somewhere around 50 to 60%.

1300
02:08:30,453 --> 02:08:49,835
[SPEAKER_23]: But keep in mind, these are these are residences, not dissimilar to your own, meaning that that the the quantity of light in a in a residential bedroom or living room, coming from LED

1301
02:08:51,622 --> 02:09:06,106
[SPEAKER_23]: Typically, LED lights is two, three, five foot candles, not 40 foot candles that might be coming out of an office building or more at a lab building.

1302
02:09:07,486 --> 02:09:09,347
[SPEAKER_23]: And then, layer on that.

1303
02:09:09,927 --> 02:09:14,328
[SPEAKER_23]: the fact that it is only 30% of the building will have glass.

1304
02:09:14,788 --> 02:09:19,929
[SPEAKER_23]: But we will look at all different glass types.

1305
02:09:20,929 --> 02:09:30,451
[SPEAKER_23]: And obviously, we're still in an early stage, and we'll look carefully at all the specifications for the glazing.

1306
02:09:32,412 --> 02:09:33,192
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much.

1307
02:09:35,022 --> 02:09:50,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Should probably also note, David, that the existing parking lot, the way that the configuration of the spaces is that when people pull into park there, you're seeing headlights that are much more intense light and focus light coming into the neighborhood.

1308
02:09:51,095 --> 02:09:57,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Redeveloping that parking lot will actually remove those more intense lights from shining down into the neighborhood.

1309
02:10:02,190 --> 02:10:02,871
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you again.

1310
02:10:02,931 --> 02:10:11,066
[SPEAKER_39]: And again, Rocco, anything that you feel your team wants to further address from tonight's meeting, please do so.

1311
02:10:12,533 --> 02:10:18,697
[SPEAKER_30]: I will go into a few things and Pat, please tell me if there's anything else that you want me to kind of address.

1312
02:10:18,797 --> 02:10:20,658
[SPEAKER_30]: I tried to take as many notes as I can.

1313
02:10:20,679 --> 02:10:38,090
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, I know there were a lot of questions regarding labor, and I want to assure everyone on this call that we're going to comply with all state laws, all safety requirements, and we're really confident in our team that they will do that as well.

1314
02:10:39,251 --> 02:10:54,564
[SPEAKER_30]: I know the question came up about mom and pop businesses we would love to have locally owned small businesses participate in the retail here tough currently leases out space to a number of locally owned small businesses.

1315
02:10:55,184 --> 02:11:01,567
[SPEAKER_30]: Tamper, Semolina's, Danish Pastry House, those are all locally owned small businesses.

1316
02:11:02,208 --> 02:11:09,892
[SPEAKER_30]: And there have been some that have reached out to us that we're speaking to, you know, in real time about potentially leasing that space.

1317
02:11:11,996 --> 02:11:15,019
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, you know, we talked about parking.

1318
02:11:15,039 --> 02:11:20,244
[SPEAKER_30]: I think 1 of the things I want to emphasize here is we do have over 2000.

1319
02:11:20,284 --> 02:11:25,269
[SPEAKER_30]: 2000 parking spaces on campus.

1320
02:11:26,189 --> 02:11:32,836
[SPEAKER_30]: Freshmen and sophomores are not allowed to bring cars to campus as 1 of the neighbors mentioned.

1321
02:11:33,596 --> 02:11:40,343
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, for the juniors and seniors that do bring their cars approximately 11% of those do.

1322
02:11:40,363 --> 02:11:51,053
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, and so if that same ratio, um, for this dorm brings cars, we have ample space on campus for them to park on campus.

1323
02:11:53,055 --> 02:11:53,155
[SPEAKER_30]: Um.

1324
02:11:55,282 --> 02:12:00,143
[SPEAKER_30]: Electric usage, I think as part of the search energy code, this has to be an electric building.

1325
02:12:00,163 --> 02:12:09,806
[SPEAKER_30]: David, I assume we have enough electricity in the area to support the building once it's constructed.

1326
02:12:09,826 --> 02:12:18,748
[SPEAKER_30]: David, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1327
02:12:23,673 --> 02:12:26,314
[SPEAKER_39]: Director Hart, if you can unmute David.

1328
02:12:26,854 --> 02:12:28,155
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, thank you.

1329
02:12:28,515 --> 02:12:35,839
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, there is sufficient power, substation resources for the power for the buildings.

1330
02:12:42,374 --> 02:12:53,463
[SPEAKER_30]: And then, you know, we heard in our community meetings, um, you know, the, the request of a lot of folks to do more streetscape improvements, add more trees.

1331
02:12:53,483 --> 02:12:58,166
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, and do more of that on Boston have and that's exactly what we.

1332
02:12:58,727 --> 02:13:03,551
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, presented this evening, so we just want to emphasize that we heard from the neighbors on that.

1333
02:13:04,831 --> 02:13:11,575
[SPEAKER_30]: and we went ahead and made those additions to the project based on the feedback that we received at the community meetings.

1334
02:13:12,075 --> 02:13:14,737
[SPEAKER_30]: Pat, is there anything else that you'd like to address?

1335
02:13:17,078 --> 02:13:18,078
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't think so, Rocco.

1336
02:13:18,178 --> 02:13:27,403
[SPEAKER_32]: I think Madam Chair and members of the board and Director Hunt, we're glad to hear any questions and follow-up points that you all have for us.

1337
02:13:34,483 --> 02:13:47,888
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam chair to housekeeping things, and we do, we asked the board to provide us with the slides so that we could share those will add those to the file that's available to the public.

1338
02:13:49,668 --> 02:13:57,310
[SPEAKER_24]: And a minor housekeeping, our board member who's actually recused from this item had to log off from his computer.

1339
02:13:57,430 --> 02:14:05,391
[SPEAKER_24]: If he is actually on one of the anonymous iPhones or some other, please raise your hand so that I can identify.

1340
02:14:05,411 --> 02:14:12,392
[SPEAKER_24]: He had a computer problem and was reconnecting with the phone, but he's recused from this case anyhow.

1341
02:14:15,633 --> 02:14:16,353
[SPEAKER_24]: But other than that,

1342
02:14:19,094 --> 02:14:20,674
[SPEAKER_32]: Madam Chair, can I ask a question?

1343
02:14:21,254 --> 02:14:22,775
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, please Mr. Gallagher.

1344
02:14:23,455 --> 02:14:24,115
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you very much.

1345
02:14:25,355 --> 02:14:41,738
[SPEAKER_32]: Would it be helpful, we didn't include in our initial presentation an overview of the specifics of our application and where we are requesting relief through site plan approval.

1346
02:14:41,778 --> 02:14:44,899
[SPEAKER_32]: Would it be helpful to provide an overview of that for the board?

1347
02:14:46,031 --> 02:14:57,305
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, I know that Parkin is one and we weren't discussing Parkin in detail this evening only because the director of traffic and Parkin has not had a chance to weigh in and neither has the board.

1348
02:14:58,106 --> 02:15:02,752
[SPEAKER_39]: But if you feel as though it will help with the public this evening, you can go right ahead.

1349
02:15:04,287 --> 02:15:04,928
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, ma'am.

1350
02:15:05,849 --> 02:15:13,639
[SPEAKER_32]: I think I think it would be helpful just to and it's at the table and, uh, you know, um, deliberately wanted to stay away from the.

1351
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:17,284
[SPEAKER_32]: Legal stuff earlier to keep everyone awakened with us.

1352
02:15:18,145 --> 02:15:18,305
[SPEAKER_32]: Um.

1353
02:15:19,267 --> 02:15:21,830
[SPEAKER_32]: I think the unique piece of site plan review.

1354
02:15:22,871 --> 02:15:30,074
[SPEAKER_32]: For Dover amendment projects under the zoning ordinances is, as you had noted, madam chair, the inquiry is relatively limited.

1355
02:15:30,914 --> 02:15:36,596
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, to a 2 part test and the 1st is, is the use protected by the Dover amendment.

1356
02:15:37,316 --> 02:15:38,877
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the 2nd looks at.

1357
02:15:39,837 --> 02:15:54,119
[SPEAKER_32]: What reasonable regulations concerning the bulk and height of structures and yard sizes, lot area setbacks, open space, parking and building coverage requirements should be imposed on the use?

1358
02:15:56,023 --> 02:16:04,327
[SPEAKER_32]: 1 of the unique things about how we were able to design this project is to do so in a way that really deliberately minimized.

1359
02:16:04,967 --> 02:16:07,908
[SPEAKER_32]: The amount of relief that we would be requesting from the board.

1360
02:16:09,489 --> 02:16:12,090
[SPEAKER_32]: So, in this case, and we outline this in our application.

1361
02:16:12,970 --> 02:16:18,615
[SPEAKER_32]: We are seeking a small amount of relief from the front yard setback along Boston Avenue.

1362
02:16:18,635 --> 02:16:22,499
[SPEAKER_32]: And in that case, only for small pieces of the building.

1363
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:26,423
[SPEAKER_32]: Most of the building will still comply with the setback requirement.

1364
02:16:27,283 --> 02:16:32,088
[SPEAKER_32]: We're also seeking a small amount of relief from the side yard setback along University Avenue.

1365
02:16:33,677 --> 02:16:43,260
[SPEAKER_32]: We are seeking what I would describe as technical relief, given that the Tufts campus is a single owned parcel.

1366
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:55,763
[SPEAKER_32]: There are going to be buildings in the rear yard, which is ordinarily not permitted by zoning, but given the nature of the campus, we're seeking relief for those items as well.

1367
02:16:56,783 --> 02:17:00,968
[SPEAKER_32]: And then as you noted, parking and again, you know, we want to give folks time to.

1368
02:17:00,988 --> 02:17:06,734
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, review the parking impact study that we have provided and we'll be following up.

1369
02:17:07,555 --> 02:17:11,199
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, with the transportation department on that as well, in between now and the next hearing.

1370
02:17:13,025 --> 02:17:25,075
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the last piece that we had included is relief from certain requirements of the solar ordinance component of the bylaw.

1371
02:17:25,975 --> 02:17:32,501
[SPEAKER_32]: And our intention is to build the building in a way that it will structurally accommodate future solar.

1372
02:17:33,381 --> 02:17:35,784
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, today we do not have any plans.

1373
02:17:36,465 --> 02:17:41,069
[SPEAKER_32]: Uh, any definitive plans, I should say, um, for solar installation, but it's absolutely something.

1374
02:17:41,650 --> 02:17:45,514
[SPEAKER_32]: That the team is looking into, um, and, you know, I think.

1375
02:17:45,935 --> 02:17:49,558
[SPEAKER_32]: I can speak for the team would would be very interested in trying to do that in the future.

1376
02:17:49,578 --> 02:17:51,721
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, so again, just to.

1377
02:17:53,262 --> 02:18:19,653
[SPEAKER_32]: To really summarize, we're really trying to minimize the relief that we're seeking, keeping this building below the maximum height limitation, and that was an important piece here, while also trying to provide for Tufts what is really a significant opportunity to bring as many students back onto campus as it's able to do.

1378
02:18:20,684 --> 02:18:24,725
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm happy to address any questions, but I appreciate your time Madam Chair.

1379
02:18:25,945 --> 02:18:27,345
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much Mr. Gallagher.

1380
02:18:31,086 --> 02:18:41,948
[SPEAKER_39]: And if there's no other questions or comments from the proponent or partners, I am going to open it up for board questions or clarification.

1381
02:18:47,709 --> 02:18:48,390
[SPEAKER_39]: Adam Behrens.

1382
02:18:49,950 --> 02:18:50,350
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi Jackie.

1383
02:18:51,517 --> 02:18:56,820
[SPEAKER_35]: And thanks everybody for for the comments tonight I think it's super helpful for us.

1384
02:18:57,940 --> 02:19:03,143
[SPEAKER_35]: I just wanted to ask a clarifying question of sort of what's in scope for the board to

1385
02:19:06,058 --> 02:19:07,259
[SPEAKER_35]: kind of put as a condition.

1386
02:19:08,119 --> 02:19:20,903
[SPEAKER_35]: And so there was a lot of discussion on the height of the building in particular and I think the Tufts University presentation mentioned that under current zoning it's actually under the maximum allowable height.

1387
02:19:22,684 --> 02:19:30,486
[SPEAKER_35]: And so from just purely from a kind of board restriction or capability perspective, does that

1388
02:19:33,097 --> 02:19:41,362
[SPEAKER_35]: limit what we can do and so it's kind of are we to go by the guidance of what is what is zoned for the area?

1389
02:19:42,693 --> 02:19:44,014
[SPEAKER_39]: This is absolutely correct.

1390
02:19:44,034 --> 02:19:53,899
[SPEAKER_39]: There are some other pieces, including Park and I believe that Director Hunt had mentioned earlier that we can probably apply, but that has to be legally sorted out with council.

1391
02:19:54,679 --> 02:20:03,404
[SPEAKER_39]: But for this, the purpose of this meeting this evening, our two inquiries are, does this use qualify as a protected educational use under the Dover Amendment?

1392
02:20:03,784 --> 02:20:08,386
[SPEAKER_39]: Our council has already confirmed that yes, it does.

1393
02:20:09,047 --> 02:20:11,268
[SPEAKER_39]: And then as far as reasonable regulations,

1394
02:20:14,504 --> 02:20:17,827
[SPEAKER_39]: What are the reasonable regulations that could and should apply to the project?

1395
02:20:17,907 --> 02:20:19,188
[SPEAKER_39]: And that's yet to be determined.

1396
02:20:20,490 --> 02:20:21,671
[SPEAKER_39]: And that would be one of the questions.

1397
02:20:21,751 --> 02:20:25,755
[SPEAKER_39]: Should the requested relief from parking requirements and relevant dimensional standards be granted?

1398
02:20:26,196 --> 02:20:31,522
[SPEAKER_39]: What conditions of approval are needed to mitigate any adverse impacts of waiving requirements?

1399
02:20:32,062 --> 02:20:35,083
[SPEAKER_39]: So tonight is just pretty much a meeting to take it all in.

1400
02:20:35,743 --> 02:20:49,827
[SPEAKER_39]: And then we'll continue to just discuss with the city as well as council and continue to review the project with the proponent so that we can actually understand reasonable solutions.

1401
02:20:49,848 --> 02:20:54,909
[SPEAKER_39]: So that we can better understand which reasonable solutions we can impose as a board body.

1402
02:20:56,550 --> 02:20:57,350
[SPEAKER_39]: I hope that answers.

1403
02:21:09,130 --> 02:21:12,352
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry, I don't know if you're muted, Adam.

1404
02:21:14,854 --> 02:21:16,055
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, yeah.

1405
02:21:16,416 --> 02:21:16,896
[SPEAKER_35]: That answers.

1406
02:21:16,916 --> 02:21:17,196
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1407
02:21:17,216 --> 02:21:17,697
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry.

1408
02:21:18,778 --> 02:21:19,098
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1409
02:21:22,593 --> 02:21:23,313
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Jackie.

1410
02:21:23,874 --> 02:21:28,876
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd like to just invite maybe Tufts or whoever the appropriate party is to respond.

1411
02:21:28,916 --> 02:21:44,102
[SPEAKER_31]: It came up a couple of times, and I know that there's what's within the power of the board and what isn't, but this is a great opportunity with almost 100 people on the line to address the change from 7 to 10 floors that was brought up by a couple of community members.

1412
02:21:45,763 --> 02:21:52,247
[SPEAKER_31]: It's a great time to provide context on what happened there, change in scope.

1413
02:21:52,907 --> 02:21:58,230
[SPEAKER_31]: I know it was mentioned housing as many people as possible, and that makes sense.

1414
02:21:58,290 --> 02:22:04,794
[SPEAKER_31]: But just wanted to bubble that one up to the top and see if anybody wanted to chime in.

1415
02:22:05,975 --> 02:22:06,475
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Ben.

1416
02:22:08,663 --> 02:22:09,163
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Ben.

1417
02:22:09,183 --> 02:22:10,324
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, that is a good question.

1418
02:22:10,364 --> 02:22:12,905
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'll start off and then pass it off to Barb.

1419
02:22:12,965 --> 02:22:21,528
[SPEAKER_30]: But I just want to make clear that there was a proposal a few years ago that was seven stories on that site.

1420
02:22:21,948 --> 02:22:24,349
[SPEAKER_30]: We never filed for that project.

1421
02:22:24,389 --> 02:22:26,550
[SPEAKER_30]: We never went to the Community Development Board.

1422
02:22:27,650 --> 02:22:31,572
[SPEAKER_30]: We just weren't able to proceed at the time due to financial conditions.

1423
02:22:33,033 --> 02:22:36,434
[SPEAKER_30]: And then, as we've stated earlier in the call,

1424
02:22:37,734 --> 02:22:44,837
[SPEAKER_30]: we really wanted to maximize the amount of beds we had on the site.

1425
02:22:45,237 --> 02:22:50,259
[SPEAKER_30]: A couple of the comments that we did receive on that previous project was, can you put more beds on campus?

1426
02:22:50,279 --> 02:22:53,760
[SPEAKER_30]: You need more beds on campus.

1427
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:58,862
[SPEAKER_30]: We took a hard look at that, but I will pass it off to Barb if there's anything else she wants to add to that.

1428
02:23:01,263 --> 02:23:01,443
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1429
02:23:03,557 --> 02:23:07,139
[SPEAKER_39]: Director, can you please unmute me?

1430
02:23:07,159 --> 02:23:07,639
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go.

1431
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:08,360
[SPEAKER_21]: I am.

1432
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:08,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1433
02:23:08,860 --> 02:23:09,721
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1434
02:23:10,241 --> 02:23:12,982
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I will add a little bit to what Rocco said.

1435
02:23:13,002 --> 02:23:20,087
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we have one chance to build on this site, and we really wanted to maximize what we could do here.

1436
02:23:20,567 --> 02:23:21,327
[SPEAKER_21]: This building is

1437
02:23:24,578 --> 02:23:33,481
[SPEAKER_21]: not only a little bit taller than the last iteration, but it's more efficiently laid out so that we can get as many beds as we can out of the communities and onto this site.

1438
02:23:35,142 --> 02:23:40,364
[SPEAKER_21]: And it also had to achieve some economies of scale for it to be financially feasible.

1439
02:23:40,844 --> 02:23:42,205
[SPEAKER_21]: So that was a factor as well.

1440
02:23:44,525 --> 02:23:45,246
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1441
02:23:45,266 --> 02:23:45,446
[SPEAKER_39]: Stein.

1442
02:23:47,958 --> 02:23:57,706
[SPEAKER_39]: Before I go to Ari Fishman, I want to just let the public know, because I see a couple of hands up, that the public comment period has passed on this.

1443
02:23:57,926 --> 02:24:03,410
[SPEAKER_39]: Any further questions can be emailed to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

1444
02:24:04,171 --> 02:24:09,235
[SPEAKER_39]: At this point, we will not be taking any more public comments this evening.

1445
02:24:11,497 --> 02:24:11,997
[SPEAKER_39]: Ari Fishman?

1446
02:24:14,577 --> 02:24:16,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the applicants.

1447
02:24:17,279 --> 02:24:24,625
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to express my sincere gratitude to all the neighbors and union representatives that turned out for this meeting.

1448
02:24:25,166 --> 02:24:36,676
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a very concerted effort and I kind of speaking for myself, but I think also for the board, we really hear and appreciate the time and thought that you've put into your comment.

1449
02:24:37,076 --> 02:24:40,599
[SPEAKER_19]: We read every single piece of feedback and strongly consider it.

1450
02:24:41,019 --> 02:24:42,561
[SPEAKER_19]: And I thank you for taking the time.

1451
02:24:43,882 --> 02:24:47,444
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a few kind of thoughts, questions, et cetera.

1452
02:24:48,444 --> 02:24:57,450
[SPEAKER_19]: The first one is that I kind of understand that our role on the board, we cannot require anything about union labor.

1453
02:24:57,590 --> 02:25:09,537
[SPEAKER_19]: However, as was just mentioned, this is a call with over a hundred neighbors and I would love to hear if Tufts can perhaps say anything about committing to

1454
02:25:10,938 --> 02:25:19,349
[SPEAKER_19]: The aspects that the unions brought up, things like committing to no wage theft, committing to hiring locally and hiring young people and apprentices.

1455
02:25:22,383 --> 02:25:28,826
[SPEAKER_19]: It's something that I think would go a long way towards supporting the community and building some of that goodwill.

1456
02:25:30,367 --> 02:25:39,252
[SPEAKER_19]: In terms of the other aspects that we are looking at, we are allowed to look at things like height, bulk, setbacks, et cetera.

1457
02:25:41,153 --> 02:25:51,118
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've seen a lot of shadow studies in my time on the Community Development Board, and I have not seen one that has such strong, serious effects on the neighbor

1458
02:25:52,391 --> 02:25:58,837
[SPEAKER_19]: hood and have the proponent not say anything about mitigating it.

1459
02:25:59,978 --> 02:26:02,420
[SPEAKER_19]: Usually, I'm a huge proponent of dense housing.

1460
02:26:03,501 --> 02:26:07,344
[SPEAKER_19]: I love the fact that there's going to be more on-campus housing.

1461
02:26:07,364 --> 02:26:10,427
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's a mutual need for both the university and the community.

1462
02:26:11,848 --> 02:26:16,052
[SPEAKER_19]: But those are some serious shadows, and there was no discussion

1463
02:26:16,636 --> 02:26:20,619
[SPEAKER_19]: about decreasing them or limiting that effect on the neighbors.

1464
02:26:20,999 --> 02:26:26,363
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is actually something that I really do want to hear more about.

1465
02:26:26,623 --> 02:26:37,650
[SPEAKER_19]: And I look forward to hearing more guidance from legal about what are the parameters within the height, bulk, et cetera, exceptions in Dover.

1466
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:41,253
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much, Ari.

1467
02:26:45,102 --> 02:26:47,405
[SPEAKER_39]: All right, we've come to the end and I'll just summarize.

1468
02:26:47,425 --> 02:26:53,412
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I ask if someone from Tufts can perhaps comment on my question about voluntary commitment to?

1469
02:26:53,932 --> 02:26:55,014
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm not sure that we can.

1470
02:26:55,855 --> 02:26:57,977
[SPEAKER_39]: They can definitely comment, but we can't pressure.

1471
02:26:57,997 --> 02:27:00,620
[SPEAKER_39]: That's not something that's not in the board's purview.

1472
02:27:01,261 --> 02:27:17,169
[SPEAKER_39]: So they can, I think, and I don't want to negate your comment or silence you on that, RA Fishman, but I believe that Rocco tonight has answered it as best as he could, but if he feels as though he wants to provide a different answer.

1473
02:27:17,189 --> 02:27:23,513
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, I have commented on it.

1474
02:27:23,973 --> 02:27:28,936
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm happy if Barb Stein wants to say anything on the matter, but I think we've,

1475
02:27:30,097 --> 02:27:33,399
[SPEAKER_30]: we've stated our case and our policy on labor unions.

1476
02:27:36,121 --> 02:27:36,822
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, Rocco.

1477
02:27:36,842 --> 02:27:44,447
[SPEAKER_39]: All right, so it's come to the point where we will definitely have to vote on a date, sir.

1478
02:27:44,467 --> 02:27:53,754
[SPEAKER_39]: And I wanted to sum it up by saying that although the board is limited, my hope is that Tufts, first and foremost, I want to also mention that I am a Tufts triple jumbo.

1479
02:27:54,174 --> 02:27:57,236
[SPEAKER_39]: I have three credits from

1480
02:27:58,257 --> 02:28:00,780
[SPEAKER_39]: Tufts University, I have no financial commitment.

1481
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:07,306
[SPEAKER_39]: I want to make sure that I'm very transparent and that no financial interest in any project in which Tufts does.

1482
02:28:08,527 --> 02:28:15,854
[SPEAKER_39]: So I feel as though that I can, I would not need to recuse myself on this matter going forward, but I did want to make that noted.

1483
02:28:16,334 --> 02:28:21,799
[SPEAKER_39]: But in saying that, I also want to ask, you know, as a resident

1484
02:28:23,023 --> 02:28:30,285
[SPEAKER_39]: I actually want to ask if Tufts as a proponent can listen and if you've heard all the residents tonight and you'll consider being a good neighbor.

1485
02:28:31,446 --> 02:28:34,427
[SPEAKER_39]: And someone mentioned earlier, build a bridge and not a wall.

1486
02:28:35,207 --> 02:28:43,630
[SPEAKER_39]: And as chair of the city council, Bears has actually said, please go beyond what is required.

1487
02:28:44,488 --> 02:28:46,969
[SPEAKER_39]: Maybe even a donation to Medford House Affordable Trust.

1488
02:28:47,009 --> 02:28:48,269
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm just throwing some things out there.

1489
02:28:48,869 --> 02:28:52,590
[SPEAKER_39]: Think about scaling back on the heights.

1490
02:28:53,431 --> 02:29:00,533
[SPEAKER_39]: Pretty much it's not within our legal jurisdiction in this board to require that, but it's been my experience that a good neighbor doesn't need to be persuaded by law.

1491
02:29:01,393 --> 02:29:08,615
[SPEAKER_39]: And I wanted to end with that and ask for a motion to continue to a date certain since we're not able to vote on this matter this evening.

1492
02:29:09,495 --> 02:29:10,635
[SPEAKER_39]: The date would be the 12-4 or 12-18.

1493
02:29:16,642 --> 02:29:26,546
[SPEAKER_39]: That would be left up to the Tufts proponent to see if you would prefer to have 12-4 or 12-18, and then the board will vote.

1494
02:29:28,667 --> 02:29:35,209
[SPEAKER_32]: If I may, Madam Chair, our preference would be for the next hearing on the board's calendar.

1495
02:29:35,229 --> 02:29:35,769
[SPEAKER_39]: 12-4, okay.

1496
02:29:35,789 --> 02:29:36,170
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1497
02:29:39,886 --> 02:29:44,287
[SPEAKER_39]: So I will do a roll call for a date.

1498
02:29:44,647 --> 02:29:57,190
[SPEAKER_39]: Actually, I would need a motion to continue 4-1 Boston Ave site plan review for Dover amendment use for the trustees of Tufts College to 12-4-24.

1499
02:29:58,510 --> 02:30:06,072
[SPEAKER_37]: I make a motion, Madam Chair, to go forward for the next meeting on December 3rd.

1500
02:30:06,752 --> 02:30:07,653
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you very much.

1501
02:30:09,033 --> 02:30:09,453
[SPEAKER_39]: A second?

1502
02:30:15,526 --> 02:30:16,887
[SPEAKER_31]: Just a point of clarification.

1503
02:30:16,947 --> 02:30:19,028
[SPEAKER_31]: I think the next meeting is on December 4th.

1504
02:30:19,108 --> 02:30:21,610
[SPEAKER_31]: The motion was set for December 3rd.

1505
02:30:22,190 --> 02:30:22,771
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1506
02:30:23,351 --> 02:30:23,871
[SPEAKER_39]: 12th.

1507
02:30:23,911 --> 02:30:24,152
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1508
02:30:24,292 --> 02:30:24,552
[SPEAKER_39]: 12th.

1509
02:30:24,652 --> 02:30:27,173
[SPEAKER_39]: I automatically heard 12th.

1510
02:30:27,193 --> 02:30:27,854
[SPEAKER_39]: Sorry.

1511
02:30:27,934 --> 02:30:28,314
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1512
02:30:30,736 --> 02:30:33,598
[SPEAKER_39]: So the motion is for 12th and a second.

1513
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:38,461
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll second it.

1514
02:30:40,502 --> 02:30:40,902
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1515
02:30:40,962 --> 02:30:42,483
[SPEAKER_39]: And I'll do a roll call vote.

1516
02:30:44,625 --> 02:30:45,205
[SPEAKER_39]: Ari Fishman.

1517
02:30:46,949 --> 02:30:47,049
[SPEAKER_39]: Aye.

1518
02:30:47,750 --> 02:30:48,651
[SPEAKER_39]: Sabrina Alpino.

1519
02:30:49,792 --> 02:30:49,932
[SPEAKER_39]: Aye.

1520
02:30:50,772 --> 02:30:51,473
[SPEAKER_39]: Adam Behrens.

1521
02:30:52,734 --> 02:30:52,854
[SPEAKER_33]: Aye.

1522
02:30:53,875 --> 02:30:54,456
[SPEAKER_39]: Annie String.

1523
02:30:55,276 --> 02:30:55,416
[SPEAKER_39]: Aye.

1524
02:30:56,137 --> 02:30:56,838
[SPEAKER_39]: Ben Lavallee.

1525
02:30:57,839 --> 02:30:57,959
[SPEAKER_33]: Aye.

1526
02:30:58,659 --> 02:31:00,040
[SPEAKER_39]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1527
02:31:00,321 --> 02:31:00,761
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm an aye.

1528
02:31:01,362 --> 02:31:05,845
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much, Rocco, and everyone that has showed up tonight for Tufts University.

1529
02:31:05,986 --> 02:31:07,167
[SPEAKER_39]: We will see you on 12-4-24.

1530
02:31:07,447 --> 02:31:09,829
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1531
02:31:09,849 --> 02:31:11,831
[SPEAKER_39]: Have a great evening, and thank you.

1532
02:31:12,651 --> 02:31:13,992
[SPEAKER_39]: And thank you to all of the public.

1533
02:31:20,117 --> 02:31:24,158
[SPEAKER_38]: Madam Chair, may I suggest we take a five-minute recess?

1534
02:31:24,599 --> 02:31:25,219
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, please.

1535
02:31:26,639 --> 02:31:27,099
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1536
02:31:32,561 --> 02:31:35,962
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'll just clarify for anybody, there is an additional agenda item.

1537
02:31:36,002 --> 02:31:38,443
[SPEAKER_24]: We're taking a five-minute recess.

1538
02:31:38,463 --> 02:31:40,844
[SPEAKER_24]: People will turn their cameras back on when they're back in the room.

1539
02:31:41,644 --> 02:31:43,805
[SPEAKER_19]: That was an extremely cheery timer sound.

1540
02:31:43,825 --> 02:31:46,386
[SPEAKER_38]: I know, I discovered the timer app.

1541
02:31:46,546 --> 02:31:47,866
[SPEAKER_38]: Wasn't that cute?

1542
02:31:48,687 --> 02:31:49,967
[SPEAKER_38]: If only I'd found it earlier.

1543
02:31:51,987 --> 02:31:53,107
[SPEAKER_33]: Was that the Zoom timer?

1544
02:31:54,027 --> 02:31:54,367
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1545
02:31:55,328 --> 02:31:58,428
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought somebody was playing like old music for us.

1546
02:31:58,788 --> 02:32:01,649
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1547
02:32:01,829 --> 02:32:05,910
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for doing, um, I needed to stand up and walk away from the computer.

1548
02:32:06,890 --> 02:32:07,230
[SPEAKER_39]: No, yeah.

1549
02:32:07,270 --> 02:32:12,971
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you for the, and just quickly, I mean, Tufts is gone, but I originally said that I have three credits from Tufts.

1550
02:32:12,991 --> 02:32:14,451
[SPEAKER_39]: They're probably like, you only did one class.

1551
02:32:14,511 --> 02:32:16,872
[SPEAKER_39]: I meant credentials just for anyone that's still listening.

1552
02:32:19,408 --> 02:32:20,328
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm like, wait, credits?

1553
02:32:20,388 --> 02:32:22,129
[SPEAKER_39]: Wait, they're going to be like, you did one class?

1554
02:32:24,370 --> 02:32:26,930
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah.

1555
02:32:27,530 --> 02:32:31,172
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think I need to disclose that I used to work for Tufts and Hamilton years.

1556
02:32:31,192 --> 02:32:34,453
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1557
02:32:37,233 --> 02:32:39,034
[SPEAKER_38]: Half of our office are alums as well.

1558
02:32:39,054 --> 02:32:39,914
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.

1559
02:32:40,134 --> 02:32:41,755
[SPEAKER_39]: No, I just, I don't know.

1560
02:32:41,835 --> 02:32:42,375
[SPEAKER_39]: I totally.

1561
02:32:44,627 --> 02:32:50,092
[SPEAKER_39]: There was another Tufts jumbo on, so I figured I would say that, but I probably should have kept it to myself talking about credits.

1562
02:32:53,555 --> 02:33:02,362
[SPEAKER_24]: As we're getting started for our next agenda item, you should let me know who of our speakers you want me to make co-hosts.

1563
02:33:02,422 --> 02:33:05,285
[SPEAKER_24]: I think Paula is going to present or Emily.

1564
02:33:05,405 --> 02:33:06,986
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, one of you is going to share your screen.

1565
02:33:07,006 --> 02:33:10,969
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm looking for Emily.

1566
02:33:15,710 --> 02:33:16,331
[SPEAKER_38]: There she is.

1567
02:33:16,371 --> 02:33:16,791
[SPEAKER_38]: You're awake.

1568
02:33:21,134 --> 02:33:28,239
[SPEAKER_38]: Can you unmute her?

1569
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:29,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Now I can unmute.

1570
02:33:29,880 --> 02:33:33,082
[SPEAKER_20]: If you can make me the co-presenter, please, Alicia.

1571
02:33:33,722 --> 02:33:34,003
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1572
02:33:35,363 --> 02:33:35,624
[SPEAKER_24]: Done.

1573
02:33:37,105 --> 02:33:37,505
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1574
02:33:40,927 --> 02:33:43,768
[SPEAKER_24]: Only co-hosts are able to unmute themselves.

1575
02:33:43,828 --> 02:33:53,412
[SPEAKER_24]: So I've made you the co-host, but if you want to have members of your team speak, you can make them, you can click the unmute button for them and things will go more smoothly that way.

1576
02:33:53,432 --> 02:33:55,352
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, that sounds great.

1577
02:33:57,473 --> 02:33:59,174
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we have all the members of the board back?

1578
02:34:13,477 --> 02:34:14,077
[SPEAKER_38]: Looks like we do.

1579
02:34:15,978 --> 02:34:20,341
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, Madam Chair, whenever you're ready.

1580
02:34:22,342 --> 02:34:27,705
[SPEAKER_39]: So for our next item, let me just put it in front of me.

1581
02:34:32,807 --> 02:34:37,430
[SPEAKER_39]: It's Mystic Avenue Corridor District, MACD zoning amendment.

1582
02:34:38,210 --> 02:34:40,612
[SPEAKER_39]: I will read the public hearing notice.

1583
02:34:41,875 --> 02:34:47,559
[SPEAKER_39]: the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on November 20th, 2024 after 6.30 p.m.

1584
02:34:47,599 --> 02:34:54,543
[SPEAKER_39]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford zoning ordinance and zoning map.

1585
02:34:55,784 --> 02:35:02,008
[SPEAKER_39]: One, amend section 94-2.1, division into districts to add the Mystic Avenue corridor district.

1586
02:35:02,924 --> 02:35:15,614
[SPEAKER_39]: Two, amend Section 94-3.2, Table of Use Regulations, which is Table A, by incorporating the Mystic Avenue Corridor District into the existing table and to designate the uses implemented therein.

1587
02:35:17,255 --> 02:35:27,823
[SPEAKER_39]: Three, amend Section 94-4.1, Table of Dimensional Requirements, Table B, by incorporating the Mystic Avenue Corridor District and to state the dimensional requirements therein.

1588
02:35:29,269 --> 02:35:34,853
[SPEAKER_39]: Four, amend section 94-12 definitions to amend and add various definitions.

1589
02:35:35,493 --> 02:35:41,718
[SPEAKER_39]: Five, amend section 94-9.0 to insert a new subsection to create the Mystic Avenue corridor district.

1590
02:35:42,570 --> 02:35:59,062
[SPEAKER_39]: And six, amending the zoning map to create a new Mystic Avenue Corridor District and to change the zoning district designation of various properties along the Mystic Avenue to place them within said district as shown on a map entitled Mystic Avenue Corridor Zoning Map dated October 9, 2024.

1591
02:36:00,623 --> 02:36:05,546
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to ask Director Hunt for any introductory remarks before turning it over to Ms.

1592
02:36:05,646 --> 02:36:09,569
[SPEAKER_39]: Emily Ennis from Innes Associates to present the zoning amendment.

1593
02:36:12,187 --> 02:36:13,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1594
02:36:14,248 --> 02:36:32,458
[SPEAKER_24]: As the board is aware, and I hope the public has heard the city, so the city did a comprehensive planning effort two years ago, adopted in 2023, where we looked at the entire city, how we wanted things to change, what we wanted the city to look like.

1595
02:36:33,179 --> 02:36:37,841
[SPEAKER_24]: In some cases, we found that what we wanted was what existed, but not what the zoning said.

1596
02:36:37,981 --> 02:36:40,643
[SPEAKER_24]: And in other places, we found that what

1597
02:36:41,944 --> 02:36:47,830
[SPEAKER_24]: the people what people would like to see there in the community would like to see is not what was not what is allowed.

1598
02:36:48,211 --> 02:36:52,396
[SPEAKER_24]: And so the zoning needs to change to allow the kind of development we'd like to see.

1599
02:36:53,137 --> 02:36:59,304
[SPEAKER_24]: To that end, just about a year ago now, the city council and the administration together

1600
02:36:59,894 --> 02:37:10,385
[SPEAKER_24]: engaged Emily Ennis along with Jonathan Silverstein as legal counsel to be our planning consultants, our zoning consultants to look at rezoning of the city.

1601
02:37:11,907 --> 02:37:20,556
[SPEAKER_24]: In May, you all had before you some preliminary changes to the zoning that they brought forward as a first step.

1602
02:37:21,642 --> 02:37:42,836
[SPEAKER_24]: We then have been working on additional changes, and I will actually point out that the consultant and our staff meet twice a month in public meeting with the City Council at the City Council Planning and Zoning Subcommittee to review zoning ideas, changes, proposals, etc.

1603
02:37:44,245 --> 02:37:51,491
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, and through that process, we've been working on a number of different items in areas, but the most urgent one is Mystic Ave.

1604
02:37:52,111 --> 02:38:00,638
[SPEAKER_24]: And the reason Mystic Ave is coming first is because the city has been getting a lot of development pressure, a lot of interest from developers to build things on Mystic Ave.

1605
02:38:01,019 --> 02:38:04,521
[SPEAKER_24]: And in general, what they're proposing is not what's allowed by zoning.

1606
02:38:05,402 --> 02:38:10,763
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, but are things that would be attractive to the city and the city would like to see.

1607
02:38:11,503 --> 02:38:21,866
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, and so some of those proposals have helped to inform, um, the zoning as well as the research and the work done by, um, Emily and her team at Innes Associates.

1608
02:38:22,666 --> 02:38:28,147
[SPEAKER_24]: They've worked diligently on zoning for Mystic Ave and our staff and

1609
02:38:29,204 --> 02:38:32,226
[SPEAKER_24]: Members of the city council have met with them regularly.

1610
02:38:32,286 --> 02:38:37,909
[SPEAKER_24]: We actually meet weekly in working meetings and twice a week in public meetings to review things.

1611
02:38:39,690 --> 02:38:44,513
[SPEAKER_24]: The city council voted out of committee and to the city Mystic Ave zoning.

1612
02:38:45,273 --> 02:38:51,417
[SPEAKER_24]: That zoning was formally on the city last city council agendas, city council agenda last month.

1613
02:38:53,381 --> 02:39:03,645
[SPEAKER_24]: The next step is that this board will have a public hearing on that zoning and make recommendations about what they like, what they'd like to see changed, how they like that.

1614
02:39:04,386 --> 02:39:12,189
[SPEAKER_24]: And we'll then send those recommendations to the city council and the city council will be having a public hearing.

1615
02:39:12,789 --> 02:39:17,811
[SPEAKER_24]: If this board votes this out, well, the city council will be opening their public hearing on December 3rd.

1616
02:39:18,612 --> 02:39:18,872
[SPEAKER_24]: If this,

1617
02:39:19,826 --> 02:39:30,137
[SPEAKER_24]: board feels that they need two meetings to go through this and needs to meet again and discuss this again on December 4, then the board, the city council will simply open their meeting and continue it.

1618
02:39:31,379 --> 02:39:39,988
[SPEAKER_24]: If this council votes out recommendations this evening, then the city council will have their hearing on December 3.

1619
02:39:41,518 --> 02:39:45,683
[SPEAKER_24]: I, Emily has a presentation to walk us through all of this.

1620
02:39:45,843 --> 02:39:50,248
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the things that I do want to say, the zoning's been available to you in your folders.

1621
02:39:51,029 --> 02:39:55,815
[SPEAKER_24]: We've actually been working through a couple of recommended changes from the staff.

1622
02:39:56,677 --> 02:40:00,339
[SPEAKER_24]: that Emily has to present this evening as part of that.

1623
02:40:00,779 --> 02:40:11,344
[SPEAKER_24]: So we do in fact have a couple of recommended changes that we would like that as the zoning, the planning staff, we would like to see recommended to the city council.

1624
02:40:12,124 --> 02:40:18,567
[SPEAKER_24]: At this point in the process, that's the cleanest way for them to change the zoning.

1625
02:40:19,508 --> 02:40:20,468
[SPEAKER_24]: Pardon me for stumbling.

1626
02:40:20,928 --> 02:40:22,149
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been a long day.

1627
02:40:24,879 --> 02:40:27,020
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's all that I need to add.

1628
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:28,501
[SPEAKER_24]: Danielle, did I miss anything?

1629
02:40:28,521 --> 02:40:30,422
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't think so.

1630
02:40:31,243 --> 02:40:33,004
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, let me turn it over to Emily.

1631
02:40:33,444 --> 02:40:36,246
[SPEAKER_39]: Director Hunt, the one thing that I would ask as Ms.

1632
02:40:36,926 --> 02:40:43,970
[SPEAKER_39]: Ennis presents is if you can actually stop after each point and answer a question as it comes up.

1633
02:40:45,671 --> 02:40:46,492
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much.

1634
02:40:47,672 --> 02:40:48,793
[SPEAKER_20]: I would be happy to do so.

1635
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:54,081
[SPEAKER_20]: Director Hunt, all set?

1636
02:40:54,622 --> 02:40:54,782
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

1637
02:40:55,422 --> 02:41:00,027
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, I'm going to share my screen as I do so.

1638
02:41:00,047 --> 02:41:12,358
[SPEAKER_20]: I would just like to say that I'm very happy to be here with Paola Ramos Martinez, who has been leading a lot of the background work on doing this.

1639
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:30,062
[SPEAKER_20]: And has been an integral part of this and also Jimmy Russia who has been doing the mapping analysis for our team and is in fact a resident of Medford, so we, the three of us have been working very closely with the city as Alicia said.

1640
02:41:31,043 --> 02:41:38,670
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're delighted to bring to you this first set of recommendations that involve geography, that involve an actual area of the city.

1641
02:41:39,751 --> 02:41:44,856
[SPEAKER_20]: The recommendations that were made in past the spring were mostly administrative.

1642
02:41:45,697 --> 02:41:47,599
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the first that has an impact.

1643
02:41:47,619 --> 02:41:50,442
[SPEAKER_20]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take you through

1644
02:41:51,943 --> 02:41:55,265
[SPEAKER_20]: the high-level changes that this zoning has.

1645
02:41:55,425 --> 02:42:10,096
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll talk for most of it, Paula will talk about some of it, and then as you suggested, Madam Chair, we will stop after each presentation or each slide or point and stop for questions because it is a lot.

1646
02:42:11,157 --> 02:42:18,062
[SPEAKER_20]: I am not taking you through every single word of the text because you do have that in front of you, but I do want to give you the framework for the zoning.

1647
02:42:18,722 --> 02:42:21,103
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll just talk a little bit about the timeline.

1648
02:42:21,843 --> 02:42:31,367
[SPEAKER_20]: We have been workshopping some of this since we came forward with the administrative changes and started focusing on the geography itself.

1649
02:42:32,327 --> 02:42:40,430
[SPEAKER_20]: We were talking about, in the comprehensive plan, the idea of corridors, squares, and neighborhoods.

1650
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:46,237
[SPEAKER_20]: And so because of the development pressures that are coming on Mystic Avenue, we started with corridors.

1651
02:42:47,639 --> 02:42:51,625
[SPEAKER_20]: We've also been looking at Salem Street as well, although that's not coming forward tonight.

1652
02:42:52,700 --> 02:42:58,446
[SPEAKER_20]: So, in September, we really started to drill into Mystic Avenue and what should that look that look like.

1653
02:42:59,267 --> 02:43:01,529
[SPEAKER_20]: And then proceeded from there.

1654
02:43:01,589 --> 02:43:08,616
[SPEAKER_20]: These are all meetings with the planning and permitting committee to bring forward the final draft, which you see tonight.

1655
02:43:08,677 --> 02:43:13,682
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, of course, because it's zoning, we do have a few amendments to share with your proposed amendments.

1656
02:43:14,342 --> 02:43:16,024
[SPEAKER_20]: So, let's start with the main part.

1657
02:43:16,564 --> 02:43:18,786
[SPEAKER_20]: These are the sections that we're looking at.

1658
02:43:19,967 --> 02:43:32,718
[SPEAKER_20]: Chair McPherson already read out some of them, but just to let you know, we are changing a couple of different sections of the existing zoning ordinance, and then we're adding a brand new section, which is Mystic Avenue Corridor District.

1659
02:43:33,239 --> 02:43:36,302
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I'm just going to hit each of these in turn.

1660
02:43:37,122 --> 02:43:38,663
[SPEAKER_20]: We are adding a lot of definitions.

1661
02:43:39,283 --> 02:43:52,709
[SPEAKER_20]: These definitions are being added to the main part of the zoning ordinance because we anticipate using them for other parts, other recommended zones later in this overhaul of the entire zoning ordinance.

1662
02:43:52,809 --> 02:43:54,849
[SPEAKER_20]: So these are the list of definitions.

1663
02:43:55,250 --> 02:43:58,151
[SPEAKER_20]: I do have them at the end of the presentation if we need to look at them.

1664
02:43:58,531 --> 02:44:01,852
[SPEAKER_20]: But you're going to see that they're in a couple of different categories.

1665
02:44:01,932 --> 02:44:02,693
[SPEAKER_20]: Now this is

1666
02:44:03,653 --> 02:44:12,884
[SPEAKER_20]: These new definitions are responsive to a few issues that came out of the Comprehensive Plan and discussions with city staff.

1667
02:44:12,904 --> 02:44:19,672
[SPEAKER_20]: So in the case of arts and creative enterprises, some of the additional definitions for commercial, for housing,

1668
02:44:20,412 --> 02:44:41,291
[SPEAKER_20]: for light industrial these are about housing which we certainly heard about earlier today, but also jobs and economic development and it is zoning as marketing it is saying these are the things that we the city of Medford would like to see in our in our community in our commercial areas and our mixed use areas.

1669
02:44:42,125 --> 02:45:04,695
[SPEAKER_20]: And then some of them, healthcare being one of them, and some of the other actually related to housing is where the city has bumped up against definitions not being as flexible or as specific as they needed, whether it was the building inspector looking at an as of right building permit or something where a proposal has come forward.

1670
02:45:04,715 --> 02:45:09,877
[SPEAKER_20]: So we've tried to give definitions as additional tools for the city to use.

1671
02:45:10,517 --> 02:45:13,639
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm going to stop here and see if there's any questions on definitions.

1672
02:45:20,645 --> 02:45:21,445
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing none.

1673
02:45:22,526 --> 02:45:25,708
[SPEAKER_19]: It took me a second to get to the reaction.

1674
02:45:26,049 --> 02:45:31,533
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you just tell me what the difference is between co-living and co-housing in plain English in like two seconds?

1675
02:45:34,498 --> 02:45:35,519
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, absolutely.

1676
02:45:35,639 --> 02:45:43,808
[SPEAKER_20]: So the difference is how the actually, if I answer and get it wrong, I'll feel really bad.

1677
02:45:43,848 --> 02:45:45,210
[SPEAKER_20]: So let me just jump to

1678
02:45:46,398 --> 02:45:47,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Did we put it on here?

1679
02:45:47,278 --> 02:45:47,659
[SPEAKER_20]: We did.

1680
02:45:48,499 --> 02:45:50,940
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, so this is on our supplemental definitions.

1681
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:52,761
[SPEAKER_20]: Always, always look to the definitions.

1682
02:45:53,601 --> 02:46:00,584
[SPEAKER_20]: So co-living is where the residents have input over the selection of other residents.

1683
02:46:00,644 --> 02:46:10,069
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be like if you got together with a group of friends and said, look, we'd like to share a building, share a cluster of buildings.

1684
02:46:10,109 --> 02:46:13,070
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to have smaller units, common living space.

1685
02:46:13,410 --> 02:46:18,151
[SPEAKER_20]: but you all together decided that you were going to do that.

1686
02:46:19,191 --> 02:46:26,133
[SPEAKER_20]: Co-housing, you don't have that situation which the tenants are choosing.

1687
02:46:26,233 --> 02:46:29,393
[SPEAKER_20]: So the idea is that the living spaces are the same.

1688
02:46:29,553 --> 02:46:37,515
[SPEAKER_20]: It's smaller personal units with larger shared common spaces, but one is an intentional community.

1689
02:46:38,035 --> 02:46:50,762
[SPEAKER_20]: if you like, and the other is allowing people to join as they choose, but it's not a group of people coming together to start off that co-living arrangement.

1690
02:46:50,782 --> 02:46:51,662
[SPEAKER_20]: Does that make sense?

1691
02:46:52,342 --> 02:46:55,564
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a little bit newer in Massachusetts.

1692
02:46:57,225 --> 02:47:01,207
[SPEAKER_20]: There have been these housing types on the West Coast for a while now.

1693
02:47:01,247 --> 02:47:03,968
[SPEAKER_20]: I can remember a Dwell magazine article from like the 1990s.

1694
02:47:04,068 --> 02:47:04,529
[SPEAKER_20]: There is a senior

1695
02:47:08,330 --> 02:47:26,303
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm pretty sure it's co-housing in Littleton that's been being built, where the historic home or the original historic building is the common space, and then there are smaller buildings around it that allow people to live together and share amenities.

1696
02:47:26,931 --> 02:47:43,176
[SPEAKER_37]: Are you also talking about the legal entity which you have in New York City and in San Francisco, co-ops, cooperative, this would not comply with a cooperative?

1697
02:47:44,957 --> 02:47:45,677
[SPEAKER_20]: That is correct.

1698
02:47:45,697 --> 02:47:47,078
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a different legal structure.

1699
02:47:47,118 --> 02:47:48,238
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for bringing that up.

1700
02:47:55,772 --> 02:47:59,395
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to make you all dizzy as well as myself and jump back to the definition.

1701
02:47:59,696 --> 02:48:05,841
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that I might add that co-housing is often a very intentional group living situation.

1702
02:48:06,282 --> 02:48:12,127
[SPEAKER_24]: But the big idea is that there's a central area, a central house, central shared facilities.

1703
02:48:12,807 --> 02:48:16,170
[SPEAKER_24]: And then everybody has their own separate living space as well.

1704
02:48:16,231 --> 02:48:18,733
[SPEAKER_24]: There are some in, I think, Somerville and Cambridge.

1705
02:48:19,513 --> 02:48:26,555
[SPEAKER_24]: That might be more traditionally it would be in a more rural area with a main house and then smaller houses.

1706
02:48:27,815 --> 02:48:35,817
[SPEAKER_24]: You might see it in an area like Somerville where it's an apartment building with some big shared spaces and then smaller spaces.

1707
02:48:35,857 --> 02:48:42,899
[SPEAKER_24]: My impression is that it is, there's usually shared living agreements that you agree to when you move in there.

1708
02:48:43,779 --> 02:48:48,200
[SPEAKER_24]: The idea of co-living was really more the idea that it's a single house.

1709
02:48:50,025 --> 02:48:57,050
[SPEAKER_24]: One might think of it structurally like a boarding house, but a boarding house, you don't have say in who lives in those other rooms.

1710
02:48:57,611 --> 02:49:01,834
[SPEAKER_24]: Where co-living is you are choosing together to live with other people.

1711
02:49:02,354 --> 02:49:07,939
[SPEAKER_24]: You're not saying that you're a family, but you are choosing to live in this place together.

1712
02:49:08,779 --> 02:49:15,505
[SPEAKER_24]: These are some definitions that actually came from some members of the city council who were asking for some of these definitions.

1713
02:49:16,456 --> 02:49:29,447
[SPEAKER_20]: And it was, if I may add on to that, it was in part to allow, and for the same reason that these other definitions are here, to allow a wider variety of housing types.

1714
02:49:30,828 --> 02:49:43,379
[SPEAKER_20]: Both the co-living and the co-housing came out of the conversations Director Hunt said with city Councilors in talking about different communities who are wanting to age within the community.

1715
02:49:43,959 --> 02:49:50,149
[SPEAKER_20]: but are looking for options other than a condominium or an apartment and a larger building.

1716
02:49:50,229 --> 02:49:53,594
[SPEAKER_20]: They, again, want something a little bit more intentional than that.

1717
02:49:53,895 --> 02:49:59,043
[SPEAKER_20]: So this provides the opportunity for this type of housing to be built.

1718
02:50:03,956 --> 02:50:08,538
[SPEAKER_20]: So if there's no other questions on definitions, and we can always come back if you think of something.

1719
02:50:08,578 --> 02:50:11,079
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no harm in going back and forth.

1720
02:50:11,579 --> 02:50:16,581
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to talk a little bit and turn this over to Paola when we get to the map.

1721
02:50:17,201 --> 02:50:22,963
[SPEAKER_20]: So division into districts is just, it's an existing portion of your ordinance.

1722
02:50:23,443 --> 02:50:31,486
[SPEAKER_20]: We're just adding the Mystic Avenue Corridor District to your list of districts, saying what the classification is and what the abbreviation is.

1723
02:50:31,566 --> 02:50:32,667
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's a standard.

1724
02:50:33,607 --> 02:50:36,089
[SPEAKER_20]: existing piece, kind of boilerplate.

1725
02:50:36,109 --> 02:50:40,353
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the real key is going to be the boundaries and the sub-districts.

1726
02:50:40,473 --> 02:50:58,128
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is going to be, I think, a little bit new for Medford in thinking about how some of these districts play out, not just for Mystic Avenue, but as we come forward to later in the process with other geographies.

1727
02:50:58,608 --> 02:51:08,930
[SPEAKER_20]: This is your first introduction to some of the concepts that came out of the comprehensive plan, some of what we've been working with, with the Planning and Permitting Committee and with the staff.

1728
02:51:09,430 --> 02:51:19,752
[SPEAKER_20]: So this mixed-use one, mixed-use two, mixed-use three, and commercial, you are going to see again applied in slightly different ways to different geographies.

1729
02:51:19,832 --> 02:51:23,253
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that, Paula, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1730
02:51:24,046 --> 02:51:28,860
[SPEAKER_20]: and let you explain this and the dimensional standards which will follow.

1731
02:51:30,465 --> 02:51:31,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Emily.

1732
02:51:33,378 --> 02:51:38,363
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I may, Madam Chair, I will explain this slide for all of you.

1733
02:51:40,204 --> 02:51:45,669
[SPEAKER_11]: So here we have two big groups and one is the mixed-use and the other one is the commercial.

1734
02:51:46,310 --> 02:51:56,439
[SPEAKER_11]: The mixed-use then we separate into other three because they have different gradients on especially the scale and heights in dimensions.

1735
02:51:56,559 --> 02:51:59,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we will see later on, Emily will explain

1736
02:52:00,202 --> 02:52:03,223
[SPEAKER_11]: different uses to each one of this.

1737
02:52:04,484 --> 02:52:10,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to start by saying where North is in the map, so we all understand when I say North and South and East and West.

1738
02:52:11,826 --> 02:52:22,470
[SPEAKER_11]: So North, the true North in this map is on Main Street area, so North, the upper left corner of the map.

1739
02:52:23,504 --> 02:52:26,431
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the south will be towards Somerville.

1740
02:52:27,333 --> 02:52:31,763
[SPEAKER_11]: East is on the Mystic River and west on the residential neighborhood.

1741
02:52:33,846 --> 02:52:42,372
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to start saying that Mystic Avenue, it's not very uniform, it's very different because of the surroundings that it has.

1742
02:52:43,152 --> 02:52:54,800
[SPEAKER_11]: And the street itself, because of different ownerships and how it's laid out, from the north is kind of a narrow, it's not super narrow, but it's at its narrowest point.

1743
02:52:55,441 --> 02:53:00,925
[SPEAKER_11]: And then while we go to the southern point towards Somerville, it gets quite, quite wide for different reasons.

1744
02:53:01,425 --> 02:53:04,056
[SPEAKER_11]: and we will see how that will affect the plan.

1745
02:53:05,398 --> 02:53:08,921
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first district that I'm going to talk about is the mixed-use one.

1746
02:53:10,002 --> 02:53:20,169
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the blue one that you see, and you will see it mainly in the north area on Main Street, Mystic, and then you will see it on the south, and I will explain why that later.

1747
02:53:20,189 --> 02:53:28,536
[SPEAKER_11]: This area is the most historical part of the Mystic Avenue.

1748
02:53:28,696 --> 02:53:33,500
[SPEAKER_11]: It still has the same layout of streets as it has the historic Medford maps.

1749
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:54,588
[SPEAKER_11]: The parcels that you see are very small, very regular and the narrow of the Mystic Avenue in this point, it's very creates an environment to create a very vibrant, very pedestrian center area with very human scale, small scale

1750
02:53:56,969 --> 02:53:57,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots and buildings.

1751
02:53:58,531 --> 02:54:04,576
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to say a bit of the start to talk about the dimensions that we will talk later and we can pause later.

1752
02:54:05,657 --> 02:54:09,261
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm going to say that here we have the smallest parcels permitted.

1753
02:54:09,301 --> 02:54:11,383
[SPEAKER_11]: We have 30 by 60, 30 in width, 60 in depth.

1754
02:54:14,626 --> 02:54:20,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we will have the, we have two types of heights that you have seen in the standards.

1755
02:54:21,151 --> 02:54:23,273
[SPEAKER_11]: We talk about the base.

1756
02:54:23,713 --> 02:54:28,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we have three, we have minimum, and then we have the base height and the maximum height.

1757
02:54:28,777 --> 02:54:34,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And the difference is only, it's very simple, is the base is without incentive zoning.

1758
02:54:34,542 --> 02:54:38,585
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's the maximum height that is allowed without incentive zoning.

1759
02:54:38,725 --> 02:54:40,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will explain that later.

1760
02:54:41,267 --> 02:54:46,128
[SPEAKER_11]: about the incentive zoning that is explained in the language in the draft.

1761
02:54:48,048 --> 02:54:51,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And the maximum height is the maximum permitted with incentive zoning.

1762
02:54:52,249 --> 02:55:05,811
[SPEAKER_11]: So here we have four stories maximum without incentive zoning and with incentive zoning we can go to, we allow two more and that will be a maximum in total six stories.

1763
02:55:06,532 --> 02:55:09,092
[SPEAKER_11]: In this area, because it's the narrower part

1764
02:55:09,892 --> 02:55:26,456
[SPEAKER_11]: of Mystic, what we have done is after this fourth floor, we asked for a step back of a minimum of 10 feet so that it keeps this lower scale in the area.

1765
02:55:27,496 --> 02:55:36,119
[SPEAKER_11]: We have done sections and a bit of sun studies and we think that that is very doable in here in this district.

1766
02:55:39,595 --> 02:55:47,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we can go with the dimensions, but these are the main points that I want to tackle in each of the districts.

1767
02:55:47,803 --> 02:55:51,126
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mixis 2 is on the west side of Mystic.

1768
02:55:51,166 --> 02:55:53,248
[SPEAKER_11]: It's this lilac kind of color.

1769
02:55:54,769 --> 02:55:56,591
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a bit also smaller scale.

1770
02:55:56,611 --> 02:55:57,912
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very different from the others.

1771
02:55:58,092 --> 02:56:01,515
[SPEAKER_11]: It abuts the neighborhood on the west side.

1772
02:56:03,456 --> 02:56:06,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's also still quite smaller, a bit bigger, a smaller scale.

1773
02:56:07,379 --> 02:56:11,182
[SPEAKER_11]: So we allow for a small, medium scale in this area.

1774
02:56:11,982 --> 02:56:19,848
[SPEAKER_11]: We allowed for exactly the same as before, four stories high plus two with incentive zoning.

1775
02:56:20,128 --> 02:56:25,392
[SPEAKER_11]: So in total, six with incentive zoning without having to do the step back here.

1776
02:56:25,832 --> 02:56:28,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Gradually, the streets starts to widen apart.

1777
02:56:28,854 --> 02:56:29,435
[SPEAKER_11]: So we think that

1778
02:56:30,215 --> 02:56:44,662
[SPEAKER_11]: It allows for having this six stories high without the step back and also it creates a bit of variety in the diversity in the facade design.

1779
02:56:46,423 --> 02:56:54,807
[SPEAKER_11]: If I go then to the one thing that is different from the rest is that the rear setback because it butts the neighborhood is a minimum of 10 feet.

1780
02:56:56,807 --> 02:56:58,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I go to Mixed Use 3.

1781
02:56:58,109 --> 02:57:02,333
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be the biggest scale, the highest scale.

1782
02:57:03,394 --> 02:57:08,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Bigger plots, we can see it very clearly on the lots here, more regular than the others.

1783
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:15,426
[SPEAKER_11]: And it has a great advantage that is on the east side, it abuts all the infrastructure in green.

1784
02:57:16,007 --> 02:57:19,771
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we can permit in here to have a higher building.

1785
02:57:20,271 --> 02:57:29,409
[SPEAKER_11]: because the longest shadows are going to be from the west towards the east and so we have plenty of space in there to really go higher.

1786
02:57:31,624 --> 02:57:41,190
[SPEAKER_11]: So the lot sizes in here goes from the minimum 60 in width, 120 in depth, and that's the minimum.

1787
02:57:42,651 --> 02:57:47,054
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the heights, we create a plinth so that it kind of uniforms the area.

1788
02:57:48,295 --> 02:57:52,838
[SPEAKER_11]: And that plinth is of four stories height.

1789
02:57:53,418 --> 02:57:55,360
[SPEAKER_11]: And then from there, we have a base.

1790
02:57:57,421 --> 02:58:22,556
[SPEAKER_11]: base height that is the plinth 4 plus 6 of the like an upper building we call tower it's not really a tower but upper building and this needs to have a step back of 20 feet because of the height being sometimes a problem so we break that facade from having a lower plinth and then 20 feet step back

1791
02:58:22,896 --> 02:58:27,760
[SPEAKER_11]: and then six floors on top, giving us a total of 10.

1792
02:58:28,981 --> 02:58:30,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is without incentive zoning.

1793
02:58:30,562 --> 02:58:34,726
[SPEAKER_11]: With incentive zoning, this upper part can go higher, up to 10.

1794
02:58:34,966 --> 02:58:37,348
[SPEAKER_11]: So in total, we would be 14 stories.

1795
02:58:40,810 --> 02:58:49,912
[SPEAKER_11]: And then in the southern part where we see the commercial, so we see that here is really a very wide street.

1796
02:58:50,393 --> 02:58:58,855
[SPEAKER_11]: The kind of active and vibrant corridor starts to loosen that kind of atmosphere because it's really too far away.

1797
02:58:58,875 --> 02:59:04,077
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have a lot of the parkway, the Mystic Park,

1798
02:59:04,677 --> 02:59:24,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Valley Parkway connection, the connection towards the 93, so we have more heavily traffic in here and some of these areas, really on the southern part, are not really meant for walking because it can get very dangerous near these very traffic areas.

1799
02:59:24,642 --> 02:59:31,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's good for commercial because then the logistics are very easily to go in and out towards the 93 immediately.

1800
02:59:32,349 --> 02:59:39,374
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why we left this part as the most commercial, so no residential in here.

1801
02:59:39,815 --> 02:59:46,781
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will talk about the uses later, but we also bring some of the light industrial uses in this area.

1802
02:59:48,182 --> 02:59:54,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we have a little bit of that mixed use one, and that is abutting all the residential.

1803
02:59:54,567 --> 02:59:57,670
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want to have the commercial in this area.

1804
02:59:58,611 --> 03:00:04,076
[SPEAKER_11]: We wanted to make it easier for the residential and to abut residential better.

1805
03:00:04,976 --> 03:00:10,521
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have the park that can benefit from these type of uses, the Columbus Memorial.

1806
03:00:10,541 --> 03:00:11,542
[SPEAKER_11]: I think...

1807
03:00:14,204 --> 03:00:35,459
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only one thing that I also want to mention, and it's that also the MixUse 3, we have a rear setback to allow, to have some buffer between all this infrastructure and the buildings of at least 30 feet on the rear setback.

1808
03:00:36,260 --> 03:00:37,401
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that

1809
03:00:38,721 --> 03:00:39,782
[SPEAKER_11]: That is all.

1810
03:00:40,662 --> 03:00:41,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1811
03:00:41,542 --> 03:00:42,182
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Paola.

1812
03:00:42,282 --> 03:00:51,966
[SPEAKER_20]: And before we open it up for questions, I just want to reiterate, I had mentioned that Jimmy Rocha, one of our colleagues, had done a lot of mapping in this area.

1813
03:00:52,006 --> 03:00:57,608
[SPEAKER_20]: And so we were looking at the existing conditions, not just the current uses that were on these sites.

1814
03:00:59,148 --> 03:01:03,671
[SPEAKER_20]: Paola mentioned looking at the historic development patterns, the historic street patterns.

1815
03:01:04,092 --> 03:01:11,497
[SPEAKER_20]: We also looked at how the current zoning ordinance applied to what was actually there now.

1816
03:01:11,977 --> 03:01:15,260
[SPEAKER_20]: And we found there were a lot of non-conformities in this area.

1817
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:25,507
[SPEAKER_20]: For those of the people who may still be listening from the public, non-conformities is when the parcel or the building that actually exists does not match the zoning.

1818
03:01:25,527 --> 03:01:26,488
[SPEAKER_20]: It makes it harder

1819
03:01:26,968 --> 03:01:31,773
[SPEAKER_20]: for somebody to reinvest in their property and so we had a couple of goals here.

1820
03:01:32,134 --> 03:01:41,984
[SPEAKER_20]: One is to create that connection in the northern part, the mixed use one with the downtown across the river, the infrastructure.

1821
03:01:43,104 --> 03:01:51,507
[SPEAKER_20]: We wanted to create that mix of uses of residential and of jobs to address many of the city's goals.

1822
03:01:51,567 --> 03:01:55,328
[SPEAKER_20]: We wanted to reduce as many non-conformities as we could.

1823
03:01:55,348 --> 03:02:09,412
[SPEAKER_20]: And so the map that you see here is really responding to a lot of input, a lot of research on what's on the ground now and what could be there based on what we heard in the comprehensive plan process, based on the city's goals.

1824
03:02:10,312 --> 03:02:29,942
[SPEAKER_20]: And then also thinking about, and I think Paola spoke to this when talking about where the shadows would be, so putting the taller buildings next to the infrastructure, keeping the shadows away from the neighborhood, keeping the impact away from the neighborhood, and then allowing the building height and massing to drop down as we approach the existing neighborhood.

1825
03:02:29,982 --> 03:02:32,923
[SPEAKER_20]: So those are really the goals of creating these districts.

1826
03:02:32,943 --> 03:02:36,065
[SPEAKER_20]: I would love to answer any questions at this point.

1827
03:02:43,033 --> 03:02:44,454
[SPEAKER_35]: Just one question.

1828
03:02:45,835 --> 03:02:58,143
[SPEAKER_35]: The Columbus Park area, the way that it currently is, it's pretty kind of isolated away from the existing residential area.

1829
03:02:58,163 --> 03:03:02,826
[SPEAKER_35]: And so the mixed-use one, I think, makes a lot of sense.

1830
03:03:02,926 --> 03:03:09,810
[SPEAKER_35]: If the intention is to kind of like thread that back together, I think a lot of those streets like dead end.

1831
03:03:10,731 --> 03:03:11,171
[SPEAKER_35]: and cut off.

1832
03:03:11,371 --> 03:03:13,913
[SPEAKER_35]: And so that that might be the rationale for it.

1833
03:03:14,333 --> 03:03:22,337
[SPEAKER_35]: Because the way it is today, it kind of feels a little bit more like it would have been done for like mixed use two or mixed use three just because it's cut off.

1834
03:03:24,811 --> 03:03:25,831
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's a good point.

1835
03:03:26,191 --> 03:03:31,533
[SPEAKER_20]: We actually went back and forth a little bit on this area and landed on the Mixed Use 1.

1836
03:03:32,813 --> 03:03:37,694
[SPEAKER_20]: There's some smaller scale commercial in the area.

1837
03:03:37,834 --> 03:03:53,158
[SPEAKER_20]: It felt like there needed to be a transition from the commercial only, that dark pink, to the neighborhoods and that Mixed Use 1 was more appropriate as we discussed it for that transition than Mixed Use 2.

1838
03:03:55,279 --> 03:04:12,337
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it is something so I'll mention now you'll probably hear me mentioned a couple more meetings that we have, but one of the things that we're doing is, as we recommend these changes to you to city council, we know at the end of this process, we're going to need to come back and say, hey, we've.

1839
03:04:12,897 --> 03:04:17,420
[SPEAKER_20]: recommended changes in different parts of the ordinance and different parts of the city.

1840
03:04:17,881 --> 03:04:21,123
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's do one final look to see if they all make sense.

1841
03:04:21,283 --> 03:04:28,789
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's something that we could come back to as we all see how these play out.

1842
03:04:28,969 --> 03:04:34,393
[SPEAKER_20]: But we did feel that Mix 1 was a better transition in this area.

1843
03:04:35,565 --> 03:04:41,108
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may just very quickly, this was also brought from the city staff.

1844
03:04:41,829 --> 03:04:46,851
[SPEAKER_11]: They have been doing a walk in the area and this is at the moment very closed.

1845
03:04:48,172 --> 03:04:56,117
[SPEAKER_11]: So we also wanted, there is a connection but very small, it's like very informal kind of connection to the park.

1846
03:04:57,337 --> 03:05:02,160
[SPEAKER_11]: So we also wanted to include it and this was the best way that we thought.

1847
03:05:05,840 --> 03:05:08,161
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm seeing staff hands up.

1848
03:05:09,822 --> 03:05:25,827
[SPEAKER_24]: So, what I, what is not quite obvious from this map, because this map is a legal map, is the long blue parcel between Columbus Park and the pink is actually rear Mystic Ave.

1849
03:05:26,347 --> 03:05:28,088
[SPEAKER_24]: And there is actually what appears,

1850
03:05:28,368 --> 03:05:34,912
[SPEAKER_24]: what appears to the average person to look like a public road with a long building with lots of small businesses.

1851
03:05:35,372 --> 03:05:40,295
[SPEAKER_24]: And from near Mystic Ave, you can just walk straight into Columbus Park.

1852
03:05:40,335 --> 03:05:42,316
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what Paula was just referring to.

1853
03:05:42,336 --> 03:05:49,681
[SPEAKER_24]: And that just struck us as maybe we don't want to allow commercial things

1854
03:05:50,381 --> 03:06:01,669
[SPEAKER_24]: just commercial auto uses, the types of uses that we were allowing in the pink area, because the pink commercial is a more industrial area, right there in next to the park.

1855
03:06:02,229 --> 03:06:08,154
[SPEAKER_24]: And then on the other side of Hicks Ave, those buildings actually back right up to public housing.

1856
03:06:08,854 --> 03:06:11,436
[SPEAKER_24]: And those are townhouses family housing.

1857
03:06:12,316 --> 03:06:20,602
[SPEAKER_24]: And right now they are living adjacent to like a paint shop and stuff like that that are kind of smelly, and that just didn't feel right.

1858
03:06:21,203 --> 03:06:23,424
[SPEAKER_24]: And so the thought was that we would allow.

1859
03:06:24,925 --> 03:06:33,791
[SPEAKER_24]: more lesser dense mixed use in that area, things that you wouldn't mind next to your houses like we're doing in the other part of the blue.

1860
03:06:34,232 --> 03:06:42,337
[SPEAKER_24]: So mixed one or two seemed appropriate there and the one was the smaller scale to be next to the public housing townhouses.

1861
03:06:42,777 --> 03:06:46,300
[SPEAKER_24]: And people just don't even realize that that's what's right behind those buildings.

1862
03:06:56,023 --> 03:06:59,745
[SPEAKER_20]: Danielle, I think you're next.

1863
03:06:59,825 --> 03:07:00,445
[SPEAKER_38]: Through the chair?

1864
03:07:00,465 --> 03:07:01,426
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes.

1865
03:07:01,446 --> 03:07:03,927
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I was.

1866
03:07:05,348 --> 03:07:10,731
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, it was actually I was the one that took a walk and saw that and suggested the change because it didn't feel right.

1867
03:07:10,751 --> 03:07:19,816
[SPEAKER_38]: It's environmental justice community is the park, there's the elementary school, the public housing, and I smelled paint fumes and I was like, we can't.

1868
03:07:21,137 --> 03:07:21,917
[SPEAKER_38]: We can't have that here.

1869
03:07:22,637 --> 03:07:23,398
[SPEAKER_38]: I think when we were

1870
03:07:24,390 --> 03:07:30,394
[SPEAKER_38]: Looking at it in plan view, I think there was perceived topography issues.

1871
03:07:30,414 --> 03:07:32,575
[SPEAKER_38]: But actually, it's completely level.

1872
03:07:32,615 --> 03:07:35,337
[SPEAKER_38]: You can walk right into the park from there.

1873
03:07:35,417 --> 03:07:39,859
[SPEAKER_38]: So something that was a little bit more of a transition area.

1874
03:07:41,760 --> 03:07:47,684
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, and the rear mystic ave is actually not even a road.

1875
03:07:47,744 --> 03:07:48,644
[SPEAKER_38]: It's a parcel.

1876
03:07:49,085 --> 03:07:52,747
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's not even, I think, even, it's very bizarre back there.

1877
03:07:54,017 --> 03:07:56,920
[SPEAKER_38]: I was walking around and everyone kept trying to help me.

1878
03:07:56,980 --> 03:07:58,782
[SPEAKER_38]: What are you doing?

1879
03:07:59,162 --> 03:08:03,366
[SPEAKER_38]: So I think I've just talked to a lot of business owners and property.

1880
03:08:03,406 --> 03:08:06,309
[SPEAKER_35]: My partner has a business in that area.

1881
03:08:06,349 --> 03:08:07,911
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, I heard that.

1882
03:08:07,931 --> 03:08:09,692
[SPEAKER_38]: So you must be familiar.

1883
03:08:09,752 --> 03:08:13,156
[SPEAKER_35]: If you stop by OPT Industries, Advanced Technology Company.

1884
03:08:17,540 --> 03:08:17,720
[SPEAKER_39]: Ben?

1885
03:08:25,862 --> 03:08:26,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye now.

1886
03:08:26,488 --> 03:08:26,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Sweet.

1887
03:08:29,527 --> 03:08:30,908
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1888
03:08:31,488 --> 03:08:33,769
[SPEAKER_31]: I work for Google, so we use Google Meet.

1889
03:08:33,909 --> 03:08:34,930
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm still getting used to Zoom.

1890
03:08:36,431 --> 03:08:36,971
[SPEAKER_31]: Thanks for the time.

1891
03:08:37,011 --> 03:08:39,633
[SPEAKER_31]: I had two things I wanted to bring up.

1892
03:08:39,653 --> 03:08:42,874
[SPEAKER_31]: The first one was that rear Mystic app.

1893
03:08:42,974 --> 03:08:48,577
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm very familiar with that area, because my kids go to a dance school that's back there.

1894
03:08:48,878 --> 03:08:53,980
[SPEAKER_31]: And it's a pretty treacherous place to be walking, that's for sure.

1895
03:08:54,701 --> 03:08:55,621
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm a little confused.

1896
03:08:57,202 --> 03:09:05,444
[SPEAKER_31]: I guess I'm still sort of getting used to zoning and things being new to the board here, but what would this actually look like, right?

1897
03:09:05,484 --> 03:09:14,265
[SPEAKER_31]: Like, my understanding, having been back there a lot, is that this is like one or two gigantic buildings, right?

1898
03:09:14,285 --> 03:09:15,845
[SPEAKER_31]: Like, what kind of time frame?

1899
03:09:16,486 --> 03:09:22,887
[SPEAKER_31]: Like, how does this actually get... If this gets approved, the zoning update, how does it actually get enforced?

1900
03:09:22,967 --> 03:09:24,367
[SPEAKER_31]: I assume that, you know,

1901
03:09:25,785 --> 03:09:36,109
[SPEAKER_31]: this is like a multi-decade process as properties turn over and things like that to transform an area like that rear Mystic Ave area.

1902
03:09:36,169 --> 03:09:47,874
[SPEAKER_31]: I also just want to mention for that specific area, when there are events going on at the park, whether it's sort of authorized or not, it turns into supplementary parking for like community events and softball games and things like that.

1903
03:09:47,974 --> 03:09:54,797
[SPEAKER_31]: So any zoning plan, I would say, particularly anchored around Columbus Park should include some plan for

1904
03:09:56,136 --> 03:10:02,079
[SPEAKER_31]: accommodating parking so that it doesn't bleed over onto East Albion Street and into the residential neighborhoods too much.

1905
03:10:03,380 --> 03:10:13,165
[SPEAKER_31]: I just wanted to get a sense of how does an update like this to zoning actually take place in a segment of the city like that.

1906
03:10:13,885 --> 03:10:25,451
[SPEAKER_31]: Then I guess I'd like maybe just a little, I realize it's getting late, but just maybe a little bit of additional commentary on the other mixed use one area at the north end of this map.

1907
03:10:26,643 --> 03:10:28,365
[SPEAKER_31]: an area I'm very, very familiar with.

1908
03:10:28,485 --> 03:10:32,008
[SPEAKER_31]: I know two people who've had their cars totaled in accidents in that area.

1909
03:10:32,028 --> 03:10:35,491
[SPEAKER_31]: I live just on the other side of the river in Medford square.

1910
03:10:36,351 --> 03:10:38,373
[SPEAKER_31]: That is like the traffic apocalypse.

1911
03:10:38,433 --> 03:10:47,661
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm, I'm just sort of curious the thought process behind making that like a mixed use one versus, you know, some, some alternative.

1912
03:10:47,701 --> 03:10:52,766
[SPEAKER_31]: Again, it's probably a longterm plan, but if anybody would be willing to sort of chime in on the thinking of

1913
03:10:53,700 --> 03:11:00,243
[SPEAKER_31]: that particular apex of multiple busy roads and a highway all coming together being designated as mixed-use one.

1914
03:11:00,263 --> 03:11:02,064
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd love to just hear a little bit more.

1915
03:11:03,524 --> 03:11:05,485
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the chair, I'm happy to answer that.

1916
03:11:06,725 --> 03:11:19,651
[SPEAKER_20]: So you call out an important question, and I'm glad you did, because you brought it up early enough in the process, which is, what's the difference between zoning and a development project?

1917
03:11:19,911 --> 03:11:21,552
[SPEAKER_20]: And when we think about

1918
03:11:22,612 --> 03:11:28,155
[SPEAKER_20]: zoning, we're thinking about a 20, 30, 50 year horizon generally, right?

1919
03:11:28,195 --> 03:11:31,596
[SPEAKER_20]: Because the zoning puts the option in place.

1920
03:11:31,737 --> 03:11:35,718
[SPEAKER_20]: It says we're going to allow these uses under these conditions.

1921
03:11:36,239 --> 03:11:40,020
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of these uses will be as of right and will require a building permit.

1922
03:11:40,081 --> 03:11:42,842
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of them will require, most of them are going to require

1923
03:11:43,322 --> 03:11:44,362
[SPEAKER_20]: site plan review.

1924
03:11:44,883 --> 03:11:47,363
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of them are going to require a special permit.

1925
03:11:48,764 --> 03:11:57,107
[SPEAKER_20]: With all of this, and I'll highlight it later, there are development standards that must be met in order for the development to happen.

1926
03:11:57,507 --> 03:11:59,848
[SPEAKER_20]: But all of this is required, is

1927
03:12:00,948 --> 03:12:10,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Assuming that a property owner is going to make a decision either themselves to develop a property or to sell it to somebody who's going to develop a property.

1928
03:12:11,202 --> 03:12:15,729
[SPEAKER_20]: And so when that happens, the thresholds that are in the zoning come into play.

1929
03:12:15,809 --> 03:12:16,389
[SPEAKER_20]: So if it's a

1930
03:12:17,190 --> 03:12:21,233
[SPEAKER_20]: a use that requires site plan review, you'll all get to see it.

1931
03:12:22,454 --> 03:12:25,676
[SPEAKER_20]: If it's something that requires special permit, you'll get to see it.

1932
03:12:26,436 --> 03:12:32,220
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's at that point that things like, what does this building look like?

1933
03:12:32,540 --> 03:12:34,221
[SPEAKER_20]: Where is it sitting on the lot?

1934
03:12:34,721 --> 03:12:35,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Where's the parking?

1935
03:12:36,533 --> 03:12:47,436
[SPEAKER_20]: how much parking is there, if it's a special permit, is there a community benefit that's happening here, what are the traffic studies, so you know what the impact is going to be.

1936
03:12:47,896 --> 03:12:51,417
[SPEAKER_20]: All of that comes when the development happens.

1937
03:12:52,018 --> 03:12:55,399
[SPEAKER_20]: Zoning is really just setting that potential up to happen.

1938
03:12:55,479 --> 03:12:58,940
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the community saying this is what we want to see here.

1939
03:13:00,621 --> 03:13:03,783
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, so that's sort of the broader piece.

1940
03:13:04,464 --> 03:13:12,491
[SPEAKER_20]: In terms of the mixed-use one up in the northern corner, yeah, I've driven that road several times.

1941
03:13:13,732 --> 03:13:21,059
[SPEAKER_20]: And it is a little bit of a challenge, especially at night and especially when there's been construction in sort of some part of that area.

1942
03:13:21,259 --> 03:13:22,280
[SPEAKER_20]: It's right now

1943
03:13:22,860 --> 03:13:23,900
[SPEAKER_20]: quite mixed use.

1944
03:13:25,121 --> 03:13:28,022
[SPEAKER_20]: There are smaller scale houses there.

1945
03:13:28,102 --> 03:13:30,603
[SPEAKER_20]: There's municipal uses in that area.

1946
03:13:31,123 --> 03:13:33,644
[SPEAKER_20]: There's some commercial uses in that area.

1947
03:13:33,744 --> 03:13:36,604
[SPEAKER_20]: So some of those we know aren't going to change over time, right?

1948
03:13:36,624 --> 03:13:39,145
[SPEAKER_20]: The municipal uses will remain.

1949
03:13:40,046 --> 03:13:47,328
[SPEAKER_20]: But zoning that whole area just gives an option for maybe some of those smaller parcels to get reassembled.

1950
03:13:47,928 --> 03:13:54,373
[SPEAKER_20]: to consider a better organization over time of that.

1951
03:13:54,914 --> 03:14:09,405
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the standards you'll see as you go through is thinking, and is certainly critically important for site plan review, is thinking about the access and reducing the number of curb cuts in an area so that you don't have

1952
03:14:10,726 --> 03:14:24,626
[SPEAKER_20]: Or, and also reducing the width of the curb cut so you don't have cars come out at surprising areas, which just contributes to, you know, already challenging a road layout.

1953
03:14:24,846 --> 03:14:25,126
[SPEAKER_20]: So.

1954
03:14:26,608 --> 03:14:34,613
[SPEAKER_20]: But that mixed use one is very deliberately at that corner because it's a gateway into the downtown.

1955
03:14:34,713 --> 03:14:40,617
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a gateway into a transition from Mystic Ave into a more residential area.

1956
03:14:40,657 --> 03:14:45,340
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, it steps that density down to what already exists.

1957
03:14:47,562 --> 03:14:49,363
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, you're very welcome.

1958
03:14:49,403 --> 03:14:50,283
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have something?

1959
03:14:50,544 --> 03:14:51,244
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, sorry.

1960
03:14:55,748 --> 03:15:00,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I just mute myself and then I'm not able to unmute it.

1961
03:15:01,249 --> 03:15:14,912
[SPEAKER_11]: So also, I wanted to explain a bit more also about the mixed use, why they're one is, as Emily said, it's like the extension from Medford Square, the entrance to the south part of the of the river.

1962
03:15:14,932 --> 03:15:14,992
[SPEAKER_11]: And

1963
03:15:18,110 --> 03:15:22,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, we have an auto-oriented development in all this corridor.

1964
03:15:23,153 --> 03:15:27,136
[SPEAKER_11]: That means that parking, logistics, carpets, it's all in the front.

1965
03:15:27,416 --> 03:15:28,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Buildings are in the back.

1966
03:15:28,937 --> 03:15:30,258
[SPEAKER_11]: They are very isolated.

1967
03:15:31,398 --> 03:15:36,542
[SPEAKER_11]: So with this, we try to create a more vibrant, active, pedestrian-oriented.

1968
03:15:37,522 --> 03:15:41,265
[SPEAKER_11]: And in this area, we want to create that smaller scale.

1969
03:15:42,065 --> 03:15:44,227
[SPEAKER_11]: That will also, when this,

1970
03:15:45,087 --> 03:15:49,970
[SPEAKER_11]: it starts to develop will also tell cars that this is a different use.

1971
03:15:50,030 --> 03:15:52,992
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not auto-oriented developments.

1972
03:15:53,312 --> 03:15:58,155
[SPEAKER_11]: These are pedestrian-oriented developments and that they need to reduce their speed.

1973
03:15:58,495 --> 03:16:01,476
[SPEAKER_11]: So the buildings will be more towards the street.

1974
03:16:02,417 --> 03:16:04,358
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be a lot more active use.

1975
03:16:04,798 --> 03:16:12,162
[SPEAKER_11]: We wanted to make sure that the sidewalks are, and we will see it on the standards, but that the sidewalks are

1976
03:16:13,544 --> 03:16:25,157
[SPEAKER_11]: have the right size to be able to have pedestrian oriented developments and that will help to reduce that speed.

1977
03:16:25,538 --> 03:16:28,481
[SPEAKER_11]: We also talked to the city engineers that are in

1978
03:16:29,402 --> 03:16:32,345
[SPEAKER_11]: And this area, Mystic Avenue, has two ownerships.

1979
03:16:32,966 --> 03:16:44,858
[SPEAKER_11]: One, the first third from the north towards the south, is Until Hancock, that's Metfor Own, and then the rest is MassDOT.

1980
03:16:44,898 --> 03:16:47,140
[SPEAKER_11]: You also see that difference in sizes.

1981
03:16:48,596 --> 03:16:59,585
[SPEAKER_11]: And talking to the city engineers and what they are able to do in here, they really have the same vision as we have, very pedestrian oriented development.

1982
03:17:00,346 --> 03:17:10,094
[SPEAKER_11]: They will have here, the vision is to also have bike corridor in this area so that more people from Wellington are able to reach this area by bike.

1983
03:17:11,135 --> 03:17:13,036
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is a lot of future vision that

1984
03:17:13,937 --> 03:17:16,942
[SPEAKER_11]: really goes well with these type of developments.

1985
03:17:17,022 --> 03:17:23,634
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't see it now, but this is zoning established in the future vision that we want for this area.

1986
03:17:24,515 --> 03:17:26,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that answers a bit more.

1987
03:17:26,622 --> 03:17:26,962
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

1988
03:17:27,062 --> 03:17:29,385
[SPEAKER_39]: I have a quick follow up question going back to parking.

1989
03:17:29,405 --> 03:17:33,228
[SPEAKER_39]: For one, thank you to the city for thinking about the environmental justice of that area.

1990
03:17:33,268 --> 03:17:41,336
[SPEAKER_39]: When I came to Medford years ago in the 90s, I actually lived in South Medford in the Exchange Street projects going along there.

1991
03:17:41,396 --> 03:17:47,762
[SPEAKER_39]: So the fact that that went into thought, because I'm still trying to orient myself to exactly what's going on here on Mystic Ave.

1992
03:17:48,302 --> 03:17:49,442
[SPEAKER_39]: as far as parking.

1993
03:17:50,383 --> 03:17:52,003
[SPEAKER_39]: There's commercial there.

1994
03:17:52,383 --> 03:17:56,904
[SPEAKER_39]: I think there's Avelino's and a few other restaurants there that actually have to park.

1995
03:17:57,525 --> 03:18:00,565
[SPEAKER_39]: They have a huge setback with their parking in front of the building.

1996
03:18:00,585 --> 03:18:03,706
[SPEAKER_39]: So I'm trying to figure out where all of where they're situated.

1997
03:18:05,167 --> 03:18:11,729
[SPEAKER_39]: Never mind Rare Mystic, because I park on Rare Mystic just to be able to go to Avelino's restaurant there.

1998
03:18:11,749 --> 03:18:16,410
[SPEAKER_39]: So I'm just trying to figure out how this is all going to situate with parking and so forth and so on.

1999
03:18:20,978 --> 03:18:23,120
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just pulling up the Google map.

2000
03:18:23,220 --> 03:18:26,943
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll take me a second so we can see what it looks like on the ground.

2001
03:18:26,963 --> 03:18:32,729
[SPEAKER_24]: And to be clear, nothing actually changes unless somebody sells their property.

2002
03:18:32,809 --> 03:18:47,602
[SPEAKER_24]: Like what could happen is that the owner of Rear Mistic Ave decides that he could redevelop into something a lot more lucrative for him and makes that like public appearing road and parking go away.

2003
03:18:49,633 --> 03:18:54,596
[SPEAKER_24]: He could do that no matter what we zone it, but he or she, or they.

2004
03:18:55,497 --> 03:19:07,685
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, and while you're answering that, I am going to actually, if we can please allow President, City Council President Black Bears has to ask, would like to ask a question.

2005
03:19:08,846 --> 03:19:14,830
[SPEAKER_20]: I've just asked him to unmute and while he's unmuting, so this, can you see my cursor, I hope?

2006
03:19:15,311 --> 03:19:17,872
[SPEAKER_20]: So this area is going to be our mixed one.

2007
03:19:19,224 --> 03:19:21,265
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we're coming all the way down.

2008
03:19:21,345 --> 03:19:29,567
[SPEAKER_20]: Think of Mix 2 on the left-hand side and Mix 3 on the right-hand side, coming down to here.

2009
03:19:29,667 --> 03:19:34,368
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we're getting into the, I have to zoom out to see where I am now.

2010
03:19:34,748 --> 03:19:37,309
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we're getting into the commercial area down in here.

2011
03:19:37,329 --> 03:19:39,970
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we're out.

2012
03:19:40,030 --> 03:19:41,150
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's roughly it.

2013
03:19:41,490 --> 03:19:44,791
[SPEAKER_20]: But you can see why we reoriented the map a little bit.

2014
03:19:44,831 --> 03:19:47,372
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a little bit easier to see that way.

2015
03:19:49,015 --> 03:19:58,579
[SPEAKER_39]: So yeah, I'm just trying to see how this area would be improved because right now I even state police like are all they're allowed to park illegally.

2016
03:19:58,619 --> 03:19:58,879
[SPEAKER_39]: Right.

2017
03:19:58,899 --> 03:20:04,302
[SPEAKER_39]: So I'm just trying to figure out how this all works.

2018
03:20:04,322 --> 03:20:06,583
[SPEAKER_20]: So here's here's the housing we were talking about.

2019
03:20:06,623 --> 03:20:08,323
[SPEAKER_20]: Here are those smaller businesses.

2020
03:20:08,404 --> 03:20:10,324
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's the Columbus Memorial Park.

2021
03:20:10,785 --> 03:20:13,946
[SPEAKER_20]: So we were talking about putting the next one in here just so you can

2022
03:20:14,618 --> 03:20:16,039
[SPEAKER_20]: see how that would lay out.

2023
03:20:16,179 --> 03:20:21,743
[SPEAKER_20]: And then this being the commercial area, you can see there's a lot of parking and commercial uses already.

2024
03:20:21,763 --> 03:20:31,590
[SPEAKER_20]: And then as we go north along Mystic Avenue, you start to see that some of the parcels start to get smaller.

2025
03:20:31,710 --> 03:20:35,033
[SPEAKER_20]: So the closer you get to Medford Square,

2026
03:20:36,193 --> 03:20:41,116
[SPEAKER_20]: the smaller and sort of more mixed uses there tend to be.

2027
03:20:41,356 --> 03:20:59,846
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's, you know, it really was a case of looking at what was on the ground and then trying to envision based on what we heard from the Comprehensive Plan sort of collectively in this conversation, what Medford wanted to see, what the opportunities were over that 20 to 30 year time horizon.

2028
03:21:02,628 --> 03:21:05,436
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll cede to Council President Bears.

2029
03:21:06,546 --> 03:21:07,126
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

2030
03:21:07,606 --> 03:21:08,927
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Madam Chair, through the chair.

2031
03:21:08,947 --> 03:21:13,989
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to give a little more context on a couple of things.

2032
03:21:14,709 --> 03:21:21,712
[SPEAKER_25]: That big trapezoidal pink lot is the Walnut Street Center now, and formerly Russo Marine.

2033
03:21:21,812 --> 03:21:23,913
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's kind of where the commercial would start.

2034
03:21:24,533 --> 03:21:34,958
[SPEAKER_25]: And then that small purple right next to it, that's kind of where the current Dunkin' Donuts, Sarah's Chicken Pie, the thing between Alexander and Bonner is.

2035
03:21:36,599 --> 03:21:46,185
[SPEAKER_25]: Then the street that's going in Hicks Ave that goes from the pink into the blue at the end where that intersects with Mystic Ave, that's Avellino's there.

2036
03:21:46,845 --> 03:22:01,676
[SPEAKER_25]: You'd be trying to take those paint shops and the auto shops that are further back along Hicks Ave and instead of having that abutting Exchange Street and abutting the Missittuck School in Columbus Park, trying to have that be a little bit more of a connected area.

2037
03:22:02,436 --> 03:22:06,279
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to provide also 1 more piece of context on the Northwestern end.

2038
03:22:07,680 --> 03:22:11,643
[SPEAKER_25]: If you look, I really think Emily and Paula hit the look forward piece.

2039
03:22:11,843 --> 03:22:12,143
[SPEAKER_25]: Great.

2040
03:22:13,024 --> 03:22:17,227
[SPEAKER_25]: Something that was really important to just 2 other pieces to note is the mass dot.

2041
03:22:17,867 --> 03:22:24,112
[SPEAKER_25]: A redesign of the Medford square, main street, mystic Avenue intersection to be signalized.

2042
03:22:24,912 --> 03:22:33,474
[SPEAKER_25]: And how that whole area is such an essential transparent transit connector for multimodal transit, um, from an East West perspective.

2043
03:22:34,334 --> 03:22:42,416
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, we're still going to have a lot of lanes of traffic there, but the idea is to reduce speeds to reduce the constant throughput and the dangers there.

2044
03:22:43,316 --> 03:22:48,578
[SPEAKER_25]: Because it is basically the 1 place that you can cross East to West and North South across the river.

2045
03:22:49,678 --> 03:22:50,638
[SPEAKER_25]: Eventually on the 16.

2046
03:22:51,398 --> 03:22:54,159
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, overpass, you're going to have a.

2047
03:22:55,179 --> 03:23:00,444
[SPEAKER_25]: two-way bike lane that's connecting essentially across that whole 16 connector.

2048
03:23:00,744 --> 03:23:08,891
[SPEAKER_25]: Then the other piece where we really wanted to put thought in is what were those street layouts originally designed for?

2049
03:23:08,991 --> 03:23:16,757
[SPEAKER_25]: Because this is one of the parts of the city where the auto culture really has demolished the original intent of the street layout.

2050
03:23:17,898 --> 03:23:21,621
[SPEAKER_25]: If you look at some really old photos, there were really gorgeous buildings

2051
03:23:22,562 --> 03:23:30,287
[SPEAKER_25]: multi-story, three-story brick, very similar to Bigelow in the square at the triangle intersection of Mystic and Main.

2052
03:23:30,307 --> 03:23:32,769
[SPEAKER_25]: That's now the mobile gas station, right?

2053
03:23:34,857 --> 03:23:43,385
[SPEAKER_25]: And with the change in the intersection, I think there's a real and with just the change in the dynamic of auto centric industry and where we're going with development.

2054
03:23:43,405 --> 03:23:45,807
[SPEAKER_25]: I think there's a huge opportunity in that Northwest corner.

2055
03:23:46,448 --> 03:23:51,672
[SPEAKER_25]: To restitch that neighborhood together and try to research it together with Medford square.

2056
03:23:52,413 --> 03:24:00,898
[SPEAKER_25]: While also working through this east, west, north, south, like connectivity area for multimodal transit and pedestrian bike access.

2057
03:24:00,978 --> 03:24:03,400
[SPEAKER_25]: So that was really the thinking of the council.

2058
03:24:03,460 --> 03:24:05,001
[SPEAKER_25]: It was definitely a look forward.

2059
03:24:05,481 --> 03:24:12,985
[SPEAKER_25]: But also a look back to what was there before all the body shops and gas stations where it really was a.

2060
03:24:13,966 --> 03:24:19,472
[SPEAKER_25]: one of the city's oldest residential neighborhoods with interesting mixed use buildings and residential structures.

2061
03:24:19,572 --> 03:24:28,841
[SPEAKER_25]: So it'd be great to try to restore what I consider to be an error of planning of the 50s and 60s to something better.

2062
03:24:30,943 --> 03:24:32,064
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you, President Bears.

2063
03:24:33,725 --> 03:24:43,612
[SPEAKER_39]: Before we go to Peter Kautz, I just wanted to a quick note to the public that we will have a public comment period in which we will address your comments then.

2064
03:24:44,153 --> 03:24:50,478
[SPEAKER_39]: I don't want you to think that I am ignoring you, but anyone that's not on the member of the board will not be called on until that period.

2065
03:24:52,579 --> 03:24:53,660
[SPEAKER_39]: And Peter Kautz?

2066
03:24:55,615 --> 03:24:56,255
[SPEAKER_33]: Uh, thanks.

2067
03:24:56,336 --> 03:25:02,859
[SPEAKER_33]: I just wanted to touch on the, uh, the parking piece that the Chair McPherson brought up.

2068
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:17,848
[SPEAKER_33]: I, while you guys were doing Tufts and I was recused, I was looking through the some of the tables and, correct me if I'm wrong, there is still parking ratios at those locations, so I don't think that's, like, there will still be

2069
03:25:19,266 --> 03:25:23,050
[SPEAKER_33]: what is deemed sufficient parking at those locations.

2070
03:25:23,090 --> 03:25:27,974
[SPEAKER_33]: So I don't think that's as much something to worry about just because you put mixed use on a map.

2071
03:25:30,557 --> 03:25:34,400
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, through the chair, there are parking requirements still.

2072
03:25:34,941 --> 03:25:37,083
[SPEAKER_20]: And you'll see that when we get to the table of uses.

2073
03:25:37,123 --> 03:25:41,367
[SPEAKER_20]: We have not changed the parking requirements by use that you currently have.

2074
03:25:43,490 --> 03:25:50,574
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may add just one little thing, the only thing that we want to change is where that parking is located on the parcel.

2075
03:25:50,994 --> 03:26:00,279
[SPEAKER_11]: And instead of being on the front of the parcel, because we wanted to make it more walkable, we want that parking to be on the back of the parcel.

2076
03:26:06,643 --> 03:26:07,043
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2077
03:26:17,644 --> 03:26:21,785
[SPEAKER_20]: With respect, Madam Chair, I think Adam's hand would be up, or it is on my screen.

2078
03:26:23,405 --> 03:26:30,386
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, one question just to help with the mental map of what would be permitted.

2079
03:26:30,406 --> 03:26:43,409
[SPEAKER_35]: I think we see, I haven't been on the committee too long, but it seems like in the greater Boston area, there's a lot of demand for life science developments.

2080
03:26:44,505 --> 03:26:52,509
[SPEAKER_35]: And so is that kind of development, you know, those buildings have certain needs to them.

2081
03:26:52,529 --> 03:26:57,372
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't think I've really seen a mixed use life science building unless it's in downtown Boston.

2082
03:26:57,872 --> 03:27:04,296
[SPEAKER_35]: But is that really like a, that would be sort of the development that would be allowed in the commercial part of it?

2083
03:27:05,236 --> 03:27:09,559
[SPEAKER_35]: And then the mixed use up to three is?

2084
03:27:11,009 --> 03:27:16,330
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, maybe life sciences, but has additional requirements that there's other things there.

2085
03:27:16,390 --> 03:27:18,111
[SPEAKER_35]: It's not just a kind of corporate headquarters.

2086
03:27:19,571 --> 03:27:22,372
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, through the chair.

2087
03:27:22,392 --> 03:27:31,034
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're talking about mixed use district in that the district itself has a mix of uses.

2088
03:27:31,474 --> 03:27:36,095
[SPEAKER_20]: It does not require that every building be a mixed use building.

2089
03:27:36,875 --> 03:27:45,261
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can have buildings with a mix of uses, but you could also have standalone life sciences and mix two and three, mix three.

2090
03:27:45,702 --> 03:27:51,686
[SPEAKER_20]: You could have standalone multifamily and a couple of, I think mix one and mix two, but not mix three.

2091
03:27:52,427 --> 03:27:54,888
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's a mix of uses within it.

2092
03:27:55,069 --> 03:27:55,349
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2093
03:27:56,490 --> 03:27:56,750
[SPEAKER_35]: Thanks.

2094
03:27:58,451 --> 03:27:59,512
[SPEAKER_20]: Excellent question, by the way.

2095
03:28:09,036 --> 03:28:12,540
[SPEAKER_24]: Did we get to the point about talking about the actual dimensions?

2096
03:28:13,100 --> 03:28:13,340
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

2097
03:28:13,360 --> 03:28:15,903
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we have one more question, maybe.

2098
03:28:16,944 --> 03:28:17,765
[SPEAKER_24]: And then that's next.

2099
03:28:18,185 --> 03:28:20,808
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I didn't see that Annie had her hand up.

2100
03:28:20,888 --> 03:28:21,308
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

2101
03:28:21,689 --> 03:28:24,572
[SPEAKER_24]: I just did notice that people are starting to fade.

2102
03:28:25,372 --> 03:28:25,593
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2103
03:28:28,415 --> 03:28:29,737
[SPEAKER_37]: I'll be very quick.

2104
03:28:32,153 --> 03:28:51,524
[SPEAKER_37]: So on the subject of life science, I've spent most of my working career in life science building laboratories in mixed use areas, specifically Cambridge Port, East Cambridge, Watertown, Arsenal.

2105
03:28:52,784 --> 03:28:57,107
[SPEAKER_37]: And life sciences are very self-contained buildings.

2106
03:28:57,187 --> 03:28:59,008
[SPEAKER_37]: They have very stringent

2107
03:28:59,588 --> 03:29:02,269
[SPEAKER_37]: guidelines, they make very good neighbors.

2108
03:29:02,929 --> 03:29:15,114
[SPEAKER_37]: And one of the things I feel very strongly about is that along with having life science buildings, to have housing right nearby.

2109
03:29:15,694 --> 03:29:19,896
[SPEAKER_37]: Because what I have found during the 25 years that I watched

2110
03:29:23,067 --> 03:29:48,602
[SPEAKER_37]: For example, Cambridgeport go from Ford Motor Company, and when Millennium went in and Sylvania was there, and it truly was a manufacturing area, and it became a true mixed life science buildings, retail, and heavy residential.

2111
03:29:49,538 --> 03:29:56,060
[SPEAKER_37]: So for example, we know that Bank of America is decamping.

2112
03:29:57,020 --> 03:30:03,721
[SPEAKER_37]: So that location is in the mixed-use three area.

2113
03:30:05,202 --> 03:30:11,923
[SPEAKER_37]: What is coming in to the city with properties like that?

2114
03:30:19,962 --> 03:30:20,743
[SPEAKER_37]: right now.

2115
03:30:21,444 --> 03:30:27,693
[SPEAKER_37]: How is the thought of developing those areas right now that are abutting the highway?

2116
03:30:33,975 --> 03:30:40,641
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not positive what you're asking, but I'm wondering if we should actually look at what are the uses we're allowing in these areas?

2117
03:30:40,661 --> 03:30:43,844
[SPEAKER_24]: Because the idea- Yeah, that's where I was going.

2118
03:30:43,864 --> 03:30:44,925
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2119
03:30:45,366 --> 03:30:54,174
[SPEAKER_24]: It allows high-rise apartment buildings, and it allows high-rise life science buildings or other kinds.

2120
03:30:54,835 --> 03:30:57,517
[SPEAKER_24]: It wouldn't allow like a paper manufacturer.

2121
03:30:58,999 --> 03:31:02,221
[SPEAKER_24]: And we also have in here performance standards.

2122
03:31:03,082 --> 03:31:12,530
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think that's what we sort of want to start to talk about, as well, because we are, we do get a mix of different types of people coming in.

2123
03:31:12,550 --> 03:31:15,172
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it would actually be helpful to see the rest of this.

2124
03:31:16,393 --> 03:31:19,656
[SPEAKER_24]: We didn't get specific enough yet for you to really get it.

2125
03:31:19,676 --> 03:31:20,657
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2126
03:31:21,967 --> 03:31:25,390
[SPEAKER_20]: So I will proceed with the permission of the chair.

2127
03:31:26,231 --> 03:31:31,176
[SPEAKER_20]: Paul, I'm going to do the dimensional standards and you can jump in if I forget anything.

2128
03:31:33,398 --> 03:31:39,244
[SPEAKER_20]: Because we just talked about geography and buildings, we're going to talk about dimensional standards next and then we'll talk about uses.

2129
03:31:40,385 --> 03:31:55,475
[SPEAKER_20]: These are the table of dimensional requirements and POA already hit some of these, so I'm not going to go through them all, but you can see that the different districts have different requirements for lot width, depth, frontage.

2130
03:31:56,536 --> 03:32:02,080
[SPEAKER_20]: This is reflecting A, the conditions on the ground that we already talked about, the fact that some of the

2131
03:32:02,640 --> 03:32:06,024
[SPEAKER_20]: areas have very much larger parcels than others.

2132
03:32:06,525 --> 03:32:10,610
[SPEAKER_20]: It's also talking about the type of ground floor we want to have.

2133
03:32:10,690 --> 03:32:20,142
[SPEAKER_20]: So the mixed use district, we are looking for active ground floors, the commercial less so because of the self-contained nature of some of those businesses.

2134
03:32:21,813 --> 03:32:34,460
[SPEAKER_20]: You can see the minimum height, the base height, and the maximum height, as Paolo has already explained it, the maximum height is achievable only with these incentive bonuses.

2135
03:32:35,061 --> 03:32:46,988
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we've also created a ground floor story minimum maximum height consistent with how mixed-use buildings are being built today with a higher ground floor that is

2136
03:32:47,468 --> 03:32:50,710
[SPEAKER_20]: particularly important in restaurant and some retail.

2137
03:32:50,750 --> 03:32:53,272
[SPEAKER_20]: So we wanted to give the flexibility for that.

2138
03:32:53,772 --> 03:33:00,156
[SPEAKER_20]: And then Pella also mentioned the step back above the fourth floor for mix one and three.

2139
03:33:00,216 --> 03:33:03,177
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a different requirement for mix two.

2140
03:33:03,237 --> 03:33:08,921
[SPEAKER_20]: When you do a step back, you're pushing those upper floors away from the street.

2141
03:33:09,766 --> 03:33:14,430
[SPEAKER_20]: We and that means that the more is going towards the back of the lot.

2142
03:33:14,870 --> 03:33:22,115
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't want that and mix to which is a budding the residential areas so we don't have a step back requirement for that.

2143
03:33:23,036 --> 03:33:32,964
[SPEAKER_20]: If you look at some of the earlier presentations which I believe are on the city's website we have diagrams showing that and can certainly provide that to the planning board in the future.

2144
03:33:33,704 --> 03:33:34,845
[SPEAKER_20]: We can circle back to these.

2145
03:33:34,925 --> 03:33:38,568
[SPEAKER_20]: I do want to get, oh, and I forgot the setbacks.

2146
03:33:38,668 --> 03:33:41,090
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is from the lot line to the building.

2147
03:33:42,311 --> 03:33:49,176
[SPEAKER_20]: We give a minimum front to widen the street, but also to keep the buildings

2148
03:33:49,856 --> 03:33:53,918
[SPEAKER_20]: fairly close, but you see that you have that 20-foot maximum.

2149
03:33:53,958 --> 03:34:02,162
[SPEAKER_20]: That's if they're going to do a public plaza or some other activated use in front of the building that contributes to that pedestrian environment.

2150
03:34:02,182 --> 03:34:03,822
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's already flexibility.

2151
03:34:04,142 --> 03:34:06,343
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't have to ask for a waiver or a variance.

2152
03:34:06,363 --> 03:34:09,645
[SPEAKER_20]: There's already flexibility built into the guidelines for doing that.

2153
03:34:10,494 --> 03:34:12,817
[SPEAKER_20]: And then stormwater and landscaping.

2154
03:34:12,857 --> 03:34:23,770
[SPEAKER_20]: So in addition to the comprehensive plan, the city's housing production plan, the goals for the economy and for housing, the city also has the climate action adaptation plan and

2155
03:34:25,952 --> 03:34:29,534
[SPEAKER_20]: this starts to feed into some of the other standards.

2156
03:34:29,574 --> 03:34:39,960
[SPEAKER_20]: So that includes the building coverage, the green score, which is a new type of standard that we will talk about later, and the open space.

2157
03:34:40,040 --> 03:34:44,883
[SPEAKER_20]: And so these requirements, in conjunction with the other development standards,

2158
03:34:45,343 --> 03:34:55,290
[SPEAKER_20]: are designed to help the city address its climate goals, especially for not just stormwater management, but also the heat island effect with new development.

2159
03:34:55,350 --> 03:34:57,311
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll talk about those a little bit more.

2160
03:34:58,712 --> 03:35:02,875
[SPEAKER_20]: Any burning questions on developments on the dimensional standards?

2161
03:35:05,088 --> 03:35:08,452
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to move forward and talk about the table of use regulations.

2162
03:35:08,512 --> 03:35:23,690
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, I can, I did not in this presentation, because it would have been tiny little text, put up all of the uses, but I'm going to explain what you're looking at and then I can put up the table of uses and just walk you through them.

2163
03:35:24,990 --> 03:35:30,533
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you will be familiar, I think, with the table of uses from the existing zoning.

2164
03:35:30,573 --> 03:35:33,454
[SPEAKER_20]: This would be added to that section.

2165
03:35:34,694 --> 03:35:39,817
[SPEAKER_20]: The bold is new text, the crossed out is removed text.

2166
03:35:39,877 --> 03:35:43,178
[SPEAKER_20]: This is lined up with your existing table of uses.

2167
03:35:44,495 --> 03:35:52,977
[SPEAKER_20]: We but it will be it's, it will be in the same section but it'll be its own table because otherwise you're going to need to do a scroll instead of eight and a half by 11 pages.

2168
03:35:54,278 --> 03:36:01,340
[SPEAKER_20]: The mystic Avenue quarter district so in addition to the, the sub districts here are not just different by.

2169
03:36:01,840 --> 03:36:05,002
[SPEAKER_20]: dimensional standards, they are also different by use.

2170
03:36:05,143 --> 03:36:17,732
[SPEAKER_20]: So you should be looking for the Y for yes, permitted as of right, the no, which means it's not permitted, or CDB for a special permit from the Community Development Board.

2171
03:36:20,093 --> 03:36:28,378
[SPEAKER_20]: The parking space requirements and the loading requirements, we changed these in the spring, so we have not further changed these.

2172
03:36:28,418 --> 03:36:33,120
[SPEAKER_20]: These are still the same requirements for the existing uses.

2173
03:36:34,081 --> 03:36:40,564
[SPEAKER_20]: The table of use regulations is broken down into these categories, so residential, community, etc.

2174
03:36:40,984 --> 03:36:47,048
[SPEAKER_20]: What I'm going to do is I'm going to stop this share and I'm going to bring up the actual zoning regs so we can

2175
03:36:48,406 --> 03:36:59,769
[SPEAKER_20]: see what that looks like, and then I'll walk you through some of the changes that I think will make more sense to see.

2176
03:37:01,750 --> 03:37:08,472
[SPEAKER_20]: So, some of the changes are adding the uses that we had talked about in the definitions.

2177
03:37:09,140 --> 03:37:10,621
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry for making you all dizzy.

2178
03:37:10,661 --> 03:37:13,724
[SPEAKER_20]: So you see co-living, co-housing, et cetera, coming in.

2179
03:37:14,104 --> 03:37:17,446
[SPEAKER_20]: These are the new defined terms that are being added to the districts.

2180
03:37:17,787 --> 03:37:25,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Now you're going to see no in all of these because what we're doing is twofold in this zoning ordinance.

2181
03:37:25,312 --> 03:37:28,515
[SPEAKER_20]: We are adding them to the overall table of uses.

2182
03:37:29,876 --> 03:37:36,804
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, in some cases, we're adding to, for the sake of, yes, they're being prohibited here in Mystic Avenue.

2183
03:37:37,244 --> 03:37:40,808
[SPEAKER_20]: They may be allowed elsewhere in the ordinance as we move through.

2184
03:37:40,828 --> 03:37:48,977
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you will almost always see some sort of definition or table of use change as we continue to come before you.

2185
03:37:49,497 --> 03:37:53,161
[SPEAKER_20]: So, as I said, in some cases these aren't allowed, but in some cases they are.

2186
03:37:53,342 --> 03:37:57,506
[SPEAKER_20]: So, looking at the mixed use one, you can see that we allow multiple dwelling.

2187
03:37:59,208 --> 03:38:02,752
[SPEAKER_20]: We allow the co-housing because that's a larger scale.

2188
03:38:03,553 --> 03:38:09,260
[SPEAKER_20]: So, primarily the mix of uses in one, two, and three is the multiple dwelling.

2189
03:38:10,180 --> 03:38:17,063
[SPEAKER_20]: We're working on some lower scale neighborhood that will have the 4 to 6 unit or the 4 to 12 unit.

2190
03:38:17,564 --> 03:38:19,404
[SPEAKER_20]: We haven't brought that forward to you yet.

2191
03:38:20,725 --> 03:38:22,326
[SPEAKER_20]: Community uses are allowed.

2192
03:38:22,506 --> 03:38:25,967
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of these are the exempt uses under state zoning laws.

2193
03:38:26,007 --> 03:38:32,630
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's some under Section 3 of Chapter 40A, there are what they call exempt uses.

2194
03:38:32,710 --> 03:38:34,091
[SPEAKER_20]: These are included in here.

2195
03:38:35,092 --> 03:38:52,889
[SPEAKER_20]: In this section, you see the open recreational and agricultural, and then I think the commercial uses are where it starts to get a little bit more interesting because you see some of the goals for the new economic development type uses coming in.

2196
03:38:53,830 --> 03:39:00,313
[SPEAKER_20]: artisanal fabrication, artistic creative production, those arts uses that we looked at in the definition.

2197
03:39:00,333 --> 03:39:06,856
[SPEAKER_20]: You're seeing some of the medical uses come in or the hospital-related uses coming in.

2198
03:39:07,756 --> 03:39:13,559
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there's some uses that came in earlier this spring, like, for example, the neighborhood retail.

2199
03:39:17,223 --> 03:39:21,126
[SPEAKER_20]: One important thing is the adult uses.

2200
03:39:21,706 --> 03:39:27,089
[SPEAKER_20]: This particular area was the only area that had adult uses, so those have been appropriately added in here.

2201
03:39:27,590 --> 03:39:43,079
[SPEAKER_20]: You're seeing in the mixed-use, all of those motor vehicle uses are being removed from the mixed-use areas, but they are allowed in the commercial subdistrict, and that's consistent with the type of uses we'd like to see and with the pedestrian environment.

2202
03:39:43,659 --> 03:39:45,260
[SPEAKER_20]: parking accessory uses.

2203
03:39:45,781 --> 03:39:51,065
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, most of the industrial uses are being taken out of the mixed-use district.

2204
03:39:51,565 --> 03:39:56,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of them are allowed in the commercial district under a special permit.

2205
03:39:57,389 --> 03:40:02,433
[SPEAKER_20]: And then these new industrial uses that you didn't have until we defined them now.

2206
03:40:02,833 --> 03:40:08,918
[SPEAKER_20]: So you see life science being allowed to mix 2-3 in commercial, food production in 2-3 in commercial,

2207
03:40:09,378 --> 03:40:13,522
[SPEAKER_20]: distillery or winery and all of them, makerspaces and all of them.

2208
03:40:14,603 --> 03:40:24,412
[SPEAKER_20]: We added shared use kitchen by special permit because there's certain standards we might want to have around loading and access in there.

2209
03:40:26,573 --> 03:40:29,013
[SPEAKER_20]: And then most of these are similar uses.

2210
03:40:29,093 --> 03:40:33,574
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's overall, that's what we're looking at as the change use standards.

2211
03:40:34,534 --> 03:40:39,255
[SPEAKER_20]: More in an enhanced commercial profile for the mixed uses.

2212
03:40:40,415 --> 03:40:53,118
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a primarily a multifamily development area, so you don't get some of the other residential uses we're adding to the definitions, but you will see those come through when we look at the next set of zoning changes.

2213
03:40:54,438 --> 03:40:55,538
[SPEAKER_20]: Any questions on uses?

2214
03:40:58,458 --> 03:41:05,880
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have a question, but I'm going to be honest that I am feeling myself fading and having a hard time focusing.

2215
03:41:05,920 --> 03:41:09,561
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been up since six and have to be up at six again tomorrow.

2216
03:41:09,581 --> 03:41:18,664
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I don't know what to do about that, but I am recognizing that and wanted to be honest about it.

2217
03:41:20,331 --> 03:41:21,232
[SPEAKER_20]: I love honesty.

2218
03:41:21,352 --> 03:41:34,283
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to zoom through the boilerplate portions of the zoning, if you don't mind, and get to, I think, the key things, which will be the development incentives and maybe an introduction to the development standards.

2219
03:41:34,804 --> 03:41:37,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably take me another five minutes, if that makes sense to the board.

2220
03:41:38,007 --> 03:41:40,149
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, great.

2221
03:41:40,269 --> 03:41:42,231
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me just reshare that screen.

2222
03:41:42,251 --> 03:41:42,311
[SPEAKER_20]: And...

2223
03:41:46,898 --> 03:41:49,060
[SPEAKER_20]: So we finished up with the uses.

2224
03:41:49,140 --> 03:41:53,305
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is the last piece where we're adding the district itself.

2225
03:41:53,625 --> 03:41:58,970
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything else we've talked about, we've amended in the main part of the zoning ordinance because you had the sections.

2226
03:41:59,070 --> 03:42:00,392
[SPEAKER_20]: Now we're adding the district.

2227
03:42:00,932 --> 03:42:01,693
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a purpose.

2228
03:42:01,933 --> 03:42:03,495
[SPEAKER_20]: There's an applicability section.

2229
03:42:04,260 --> 03:42:09,203
[SPEAKER_20]: Waivers from the dimensional requirements or additional standards for the dimensional requirements.

2230
03:42:09,663 --> 03:42:12,645
[SPEAKER_20]: The development incentives, which I want to talk about with you.

2231
03:42:13,506 --> 03:42:17,468
[SPEAKER_20]: The design guidelines and the applicability of the development standards.

2232
03:42:17,989 --> 03:42:20,470
[SPEAKER_20]: The development standards, which we'll talk about a little bit.

2233
03:42:20,791 --> 03:42:27,435
[SPEAKER_20]: And affordability requirements is easy because we're just pointing you to your existing zoning, so that won't take long.

2234
03:42:28,135 --> 03:42:30,396
[SPEAKER_20]: Purpose, we've pretty much already talked about.

2235
03:42:30,536 --> 03:42:35,138
[SPEAKER_20]: Mixed use, wider variety of uses, wider variety of building types.

2236
03:42:35,778 --> 03:42:40,319
[SPEAKER_20]: This just describes the purpose of the sub-areas, which we've already talked about.

2237
03:42:40,359 --> 03:42:42,120
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the applicability section.

2238
03:42:42,820 --> 03:42:48,382
[SPEAKER_20]: Dimensional requirements and waivers, so we explain what has to happen in each of these areas.

2239
03:42:50,583 --> 03:42:52,445
[SPEAKER_20]: We allow for multi-building lots.

2240
03:42:52,685 --> 03:42:56,928
[SPEAKER_20]: We describe what ground floor active use means and how we're requiring it.

2241
03:42:57,349 --> 03:43:04,175
[SPEAKER_20]: We talk about the transition from the higher intensity to the adjacent residential districts.

2242
03:43:04,675 --> 03:43:06,837
[SPEAKER_20]: We have some height waivers in there.

2243
03:43:07,357 --> 03:43:16,405
[SPEAKER_20]: We create setbacks or the ability to vary the setbacks for infill lots between two existing buildings.

2244
03:43:17,085 --> 03:43:21,910
[SPEAKER_20]: allow for a drop-off zone, and allow for energy efficiency installations.

2245
03:43:22,190 --> 03:43:28,376
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of these you will have seen in the zoning for Section 3A that was passed last year.

2246
03:43:28,737 --> 03:43:31,119
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of these are new and specific to this district.

2247
03:43:32,594 --> 03:43:40,259
[SPEAKER_20]: The affordability requirements and development incentives are also based on the 3A zoning that passed last year.

2248
03:43:40,679 --> 03:43:48,484
[SPEAKER_20]: We have some tweaks to them that we're going to ask you to make at the end of this presentation.

2249
03:43:49,005 --> 03:43:53,828
[SPEAKER_20]: So, let's ignore the affordability requirements for now because that's one of the tweaks we're going to make.

2250
03:43:54,708 --> 03:44:01,314
[SPEAKER_20]: But essentially the development incentives is what allows you to get from the base height to the maximum height.

2251
03:44:01,754 --> 03:44:12,483
[SPEAKER_20]: And a developer can come into the city, to the CD board if it's a special permit, and say, I would like to add two stories or three stories or whatever that difference is.

2252
03:44:13,192 --> 03:44:14,872
[SPEAKER_20]: This is how I'd like to accomplish it.

2253
03:44:14,993 --> 03:44:17,293
[SPEAKER_20]: And they can choose from this menu.

2254
03:44:17,693 --> 03:44:30,057
[SPEAKER_20]: And the reason we have a menu is to create flexibility for different market conditions and to respond to different requests or different desires from the city to meet certain goals.

2255
03:44:30,157 --> 03:44:32,658
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can see there is affordability requirements.

2256
03:44:32,738 --> 03:44:34,058
[SPEAKER_20]: I will talk about that at the end.

2257
03:44:34,638 --> 03:44:38,541
[SPEAKER_20]: There's also community amenities that are privately maintained.

2258
03:44:38,701 --> 03:44:47,188
[SPEAKER_20]: So one thing that we hear is communities saying, I would like this, I would like this, I would like this, but the city doesn't have room to maintain it.

2259
03:44:47,389 --> 03:44:53,754
[SPEAKER_20]: So one of the benefits in exchange for an additional story, you get some of these benefits.

2260
03:44:54,274 --> 03:44:59,618
[SPEAKER_20]: Low income shared community solar is one that we're working on, which is why you see it to be confirmed.

2261
03:44:59,658 --> 03:45:01,400
[SPEAKER_20]: We're still exploring how to do that.

2262
03:45:02,305 --> 03:45:17,488
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we have some options based on that ground floor, parking, rents for local businesses, economic development requirements.

2263
03:45:17,808 --> 03:45:20,249
[SPEAKER_20]: Most, if not all of those came from 3A.

2264
03:45:20,689 --> 03:45:23,249
[SPEAKER_20]: We also have something on environmental resilience.

2265
03:45:23,629 --> 03:45:25,950
[SPEAKER_20]: You see the green score being introduced there.

2266
03:45:26,370 --> 03:45:30,271
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to change this bit about the lead gold and platinum.

2267
03:45:30,311 --> 03:45:31,751
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'll talk to you about that later.

2268
03:45:33,399 --> 03:45:36,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Development standards cover all of these topics.

2269
03:45:36,701 --> 03:45:51,288
[SPEAKER_20]: They start with the types of things that you would look at under site plan review, so site standards, general building standards in terms of position and massing, what happens if you have more than one building on the lot, what happens if you have mixed use development.

2270
03:45:51,368 --> 03:46:00,092
[SPEAKER_20]: The idea of these standards is to make your decisions on site plan review and also special permit when it has site plan review, which pretty much always.

2271
03:46:00,492 --> 03:46:01,393
[SPEAKER_20]: make those easier.

2272
03:46:01,453 --> 03:46:03,294
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what you're deciding on.

2273
03:46:04,054 --> 03:46:09,017
[SPEAKER_20]: We've also put in provisions that would allow you to adopt design guidelines.

2274
03:46:09,337 --> 03:46:11,138
[SPEAKER_20]: We do not have those for you yet.

2275
03:46:11,238 --> 03:46:16,621
[SPEAKER_20]: That will be a later stage of the process, but the language that allows you to adopt them are there.

2276
03:46:16,641 --> 03:46:28,868
[SPEAKER_20]: You also have corner lots, standards around parking, and then you have the ability to waive certain standards, just the standards in this section, not the dimensional standards.

2277
03:46:29,728 --> 03:46:43,797
[SPEAKER_20]: because sometimes you end up with an irregular lot or there's topography or there's some reason why an applicant can't meet the standard, you have the option to discuss that with the applicant and waive these development standards, if appropriate.

2278
03:46:45,640 --> 03:46:50,183
[SPEAKER_20]: So, with that, I'm going to tell you what the recommendations are and then I will stop talking.

2279
03:46:50,904 --> 03:46:59,970
[SPEAKER_20]: The first thing is in the table for affordability requirements, the language we had in there could be interpreted in more than one way.

2280
03:46:59,990 --> 03:47:02,892
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you to Director Hunt for calling that out.

2281
03:47:03,352 --> 03:47:08,436
[SPEAKER_20]: We've been working back and forth on some language and so rather than just saying do 20% of x,

2282
03:47:10,257 --> 03:47:31,012
[SPEAKER_20]: This table here starts with your existing requirements on the left-hand side and then creates the minimum percentages for getting either an additional floor or two additional floors and adds them up so it's absolutely clear how much a developer would have to provide to get that to that state.

2283
03:47:31,552 --> 03:47:46,177
[SPEAKER_20]: They could get one floor either by creating a deeper affordability, in other words, taking the number of required units and making some of them affordable at a lower rate of income, or by providing more affordable units.

2284
03:47:46,237 --> 03:47:47,838
[SPEAKER_20]: So that is their pathway there.

2285
03:47:48,872 --> 03:47:57,881
[SPEAKER_20]: The other recommendations we are suggesting is many buildings are already certifiable as LEED Gold or equivalent standard.

2286
03:47:58,262 --> 03:48:06,150
[SPEAKER_20]: We would like to remove that and say certified as LEED Platinum or equivalent to one additional story.

2287
03:48:07,416 --> 03:48:16,118
[SPEAKER_20]: We'd like to delete providing active ground floor space at more than 75% of the ground floor that was appropriate for the section 3A zoning.

2288
03:48:16,498 --> 03:48:20,619
[SPEAKER_20]: It is not appropriate for Mystic Avenue because we actually have that as our base standard.

2289
03:48:21,199 --> 03:48:31,862
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we'd like you to add a height waiver to the dimensional requirements and waivers because we would like to be able to waive the minimum height

2290
03:48:32,582 --> 03:48:42,347
[SPEAKER_20]: for projects that are proposals that meet the purpose of the district and the goals of the Medford Comprehensive Plan.

2291
03:48:42,807 --> 03:48:49,650
[SPEAKER_20]: We put a minimum height in here so that you don't have low value buildings going in and a higher value area.

2292
03:48:50,190 --> 03:48:57,274
[SPEAKER_20]: But sometimes, especially if there's a rehab of an existing building, you want to be able to waive that minimum height.

2293
03:48:58,474 --> 03:49:01,256
[SPEAKER_20]: we've put that in there as flexibility for you.

2294
03:49:01,637 --> 03:49:07,541
[SPEAKER_20]: That is a quick what we have in this zoning.

2295
03:49:07,681 --> 03:49:09,803
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy to take any more questions from the board.

2296
03:49:09,823 --> 03:49:13,526
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much, Emily.

2297
03:49:18,350 --> 03:49:27,056
[SPEAKER_39]: I appreciate all the work that you've put into this, but one of the things that I do know is the board is supposed to recommend for approval,

2298
03:49:29,284 --> 03:49:35,887
[SPEAKER_39]: recommend to the city council for approval with the changes raised by the staff as well as yourself.

2299
03:49:36,047 --> 03:49:41,650
[SPEAKER_39]: But I think I need, you did an awesome job.

2300
03:49:41,710 --> 03:49:54,056
[SPEAKER_39]: You've been, so much effort has been put into this, but in order for me to give a vote, I think I needed to see something from PBS on how I can better digest this.

2301
03:49:55,350 --> 03:49:57,431
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm not sure the feeling of the rest of the board.

2302
03:49:58,091 --> 03:50:06,313
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Chair, the problem is that it's too late and we're too tired because this presentation was how to better digest this.

2303
03:50:07,354 --> 03:50:09,334
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, that's my whole point, Director Hahn.

2304
03:50:09,374 --> 03:50:15,996
[SPEAKER_39]: My whole point is that I think the entire board, I'm not sure how they're feeling about voting on it tonight.

2305
03:50:19,696 --> 03:50:20,276
[SPEAKER_37]: I agree.

2306
03:50:20,376 --> 03:50:23,857
[SPEAKER_37]: I think I agree with it's late.

2307
03:50:24,077 --> 03:50:27,358
[SPEAKER_37]: I printed out the whole thing and reviewed it before.

2308
03:50:27,838 --> 03:50:30,979
[SPEAKER_37]: And it was wonderful the way Emily walked us through.

2309
03:50:31,459 --> 03:50:35,520
[SPEAKER_37]: But frankly, I'm fried.

2310
03:50:35,580 --> 03:50:46,383
[SPEAKER_37]: And I don't think that, is it possible to vote on it next time we meet?

2311
03:50:48,187 --> 03:51:04,986
[SPEAKER_24]: That's actually what we said at the beginning, that if the board wasn't ready to vote tonight, the council would just simply legally open their hearing on December 3rd and then continue it to their next meeting so that this board could then look at it again on December 4th.

2312
03:51:06,047 --> 03:51:08,810
[SPEAKER_24]: But we do want to strategize on how to not make that

2313
03:51:09,761 --> 03:51:13,545
[SPEAKER_24]: a repeat of tonight, because... Yes.

2314
03:51:14,646 --> 03:51:15,948
[SPEAKER_33]: That is what I was going to bring up.

2315
03:51:17,709 --> 03:51:25,518
[SPEAKER_33]: If we continue it to 12-4, we have also just continued Tufts to 12-4, and we will run into the same problem that we had.

2316
03:51:27,180 --> 03:51:34,107
[SPEAKER_33]: We'll run into the same problem we had tonight on the fourth where Tufts will have hours of public comment.

2317
03:51:34,767 --> 03:51:37,910
[SPEAKER_24]: I will say you don't have to take that much public comment.

2318
03:51:38,090 --> 03:51:48,661
[SPEAKER_24]: We kind of felt like we did tonight, but it can be limited to the items that are new items, the new presentation, new materials.

2319
03:51:49,942 --> 03:51:53,266
[SPEAKER_24]: And there is a different way of doing questions.

2320
03:51:54,287 --> 03:51:56,689
[SPEAKER_24]: Sometimes the way we did it tonight is the best way.

2321
03:51:57,370 --> 03:52:04,558
[SPEAKER_24]: Sometimes it might be better to take a question and dispose of it and then say we're not.

2322
03:52:05,507 --> 03:52:07,207
[SPEAKER_24]: we don't wanna hear the same comment.

2323
03:52:07,227 --> 03:52:12,029
[SPEAKER_24]: We've heard people say that it's too tall, we get it, we don't need to hear it again.

2324
03:52:12,369 --> 03:52:16,270
[SPEAKER_24]: We've heard a comment on the union, we're not taking additional comments on the union.

2325
03:52:17,450 --> 03:52:22,251
[SPEAKER_24]: That is perfectly legal and it is a way to do it.

2326
03:52:24,332 --> 03:52:29,053
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just, it didn't seem like it was the right way to do it for the first opening hearing.

2327
03:52:29,393 --> 03:52:32,634
[SPEAKER_24]: But for continuance, it is very reasonable.

2328
03:52:33,415 --> 03:52:47,200
[SPEAKER_37]: But Alicia, to Jackie's point, is there a way to stylize the discussion for the next meeting so we could act on it relatively quickly?

2329
03:52:50,281 --> 03:52:54,843
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I guess I don't know how else to.

2330
03:52:56,294 --> 03:52:58,234
[SPEAKER_24]: I would suggest that the board should read it through.

2331
03:52:58,254 --> 03:53:01,315
[SPEAKER_24]: Honestly, I met over in many meetings.

2332
03:53:01,375 --> 03:53:04,896
[SPEAKER_24]: And then when I finally read it, I had comments.

2333
03:53:04,936 --> 03:53:12,097
[SPEAKER_24]: So some of the changes that we are recommending that you recommend are because we thought we had finalized the zoning.

2334
03:53:12,597 --> 03:53:14,898
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I read it one more time.

2335
03:53:14,918 --> 03:53:23,640
[SPEAKER_24]: And when I read it one more time, I said, and honestly, Danielle found one more thing this evening wasn't even presented.

2336
03:53:25,080 --> 03:53:36,083
[SPEAKER_24]: that we may need we're just going to check with Jonathan around one of the the uses may need to be changed in order to not create a legal conflict.

2337
03:53:37,784 --> 03:53:41,305
[SPEAKER_24]: So really I think the board needs to read it.

2338
03:53:41,625 --> 03:53:50,148
[SPEAKER_39]: Which is great and the board can have a little bit more time over the weekend and we can be prepared the next time we can strategize and how that will be presented and being done.

2339
03:53:50,508 --> 03:53:52,648
[SPEAKER_39]: Planner Evans if you can please go ahead and speak.

2340
03:53:53,169 --> 03:53:53,929
[SPEAKER_39]: I've been through the chair

2341
03:53:55,727 --> 03:54:01,409
[SPEAKER_38]: And even, I know that you guys read it, so it's not a you need to read it.

2342
03:54:01,429 --> 03:54:03,470
[SPEAKER_38]: Of course you read it.

2343
03:54:03,570 --> 03:54:05,791
[SPEAKER_38]: We're not saying you didn't read it.

2344
03:54:07,052 --> 03:54:11,173
[SPEAKER_38]: But yeah, so we've been living this for months, but you haven't.

2345
03:54:11,254 --> 03:54:12,354
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's hard to digest.

2346
03:54:12,394 --> 03:54:13,154
[SPEAKER_38]: It takes a lot.

2347
03:54:14,095 --> 03:54:16,976
[SPEAKER_38]: Like Alicia said, I found something

2348
03:54:17,793 --> 03:54:20,774
[SPEAKER_38]: to just now, and I was like, oh, how did I miss that before?

2349
03:54:20,794 --> 03:54:22,715
[SPEAKER_38]: Because it just starts to kind of blend.

2350
03:54:23,215 --> 03:54:26,016
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, and that's what I was trying to say.

2351
03:54:26,676 --> 03:54:28,857
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think I may have found the same thing, Danielle.

2352
03:54:28,937 --> 03:54:33,219
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll compare notes that it was the same sort of thing.

2353
03:54:33,259 --> 03:54:34,259
[SPEAKER_20]: I've looked at that page 12 times.

2354
03:54:37,673 --> 03:54:50,229
[SPEAKER_20]: With your permission, Madam Chair, I think if after the members of the board have had a chance to look at it again, because I also know that you've looked through it once, but zoning is complicated.

2355
03:54:51,591 --> 03:54:55,736
[SPEAKER_20]: If there are any questions that could be forwarded to

2356
03:54:56,717 --> 03:55:02,842
[SPEAKER_20]: planning staff that, you know, we could have answered for you for the next meeting if that would be helpful.

2357
03:55:03,283 --> 03:55:10,148
[SPEAKER_20]: We'd be willing to work with city planning staff to get those addressed so you could have that before your next meeting.

2358
03:55:10,668 --> 03:55:15,172
[SPEAKER_39]: And thank you so much for all of, again, for all of your effort that you've been doing with the city with this.

2359
03:55:15,312 --> 03:55:19,395
[SPEAKER_39]: I just wanted to clarify that what I'm referencing is the changes that have been presented.

2360
03:55:19,455 --> 03:55:22,978
[SPEAKER_39]: I have not been able to digest the changes that have been presented.

2361
03:55:23,158 --> 03:55:25,160
[SPEAKER_39]: So I want to make sure that we knew

2362
03:55:26,799 --> 03:55:28,300
[SPEAKER_39]: what I was referencing.

2363
03:55:30,342 --> 03:55:32,864
[SPEAKER_39]: Fishman?

2364
03:55:33,985 --> 03:55:40,591
[SPEAKER_19]: I strongly move to table the vote till when we can comprehend things.

2365
03:55:40,812 --> 03:55:48,799
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wanted to potentially suggest if we have any possibility of changing the order, maybe just switch the orders next time.

2366
03:55:49,269 --> 03:55:57,876
[SPEAKER_19]: And we might be able to get through this more quickly when we're fresh at the beginning of the meeting, and then let Tufts go for as long as it goes.

2367
03:56:00,938 --> 03:56:05,742
[SPEAKER_39]: That can definitely be done the way that we did High Street this evening, because that was relatively easy.

2368
03:56:05,782 --> 03:56:15,669
[SPEAKER_39]: We can be prepared to vote on this decision, to provide a decision for this item first.

2369
03:56:17,791 --> 03:56:18,832
[SPEAKER_39]: And Dana?

2370
03:56:19,222 --> 03:56:27,647
[SPEAKER_37]: We email any, if we have any questions, can we pre-email those questions?

2371
03:56:29,628 --> 03:56:41,955
[SPEAKER_37]: And that this way, prior to the meeting, whatever questions we have can be collected and then addressed all at once at the next meeting.

2372
03:56:43,090 --> 03:56:45,932
[SPEAKER_24]: it will be easier for us if you send us individually.

2373
03:56:47,013 --> 03:56:49,094
[SPEAKER_24]: Try not, there's open meeting law violation.

2374
03:56:49,334 --> 03:56:51,035
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you were to send everybody.

2375
03:56:51,476 --> 03:56:53,597
[SPEAKER_24]: No, just to you, the one person.

2376
03:56:53,697 --> 03:56:56,099
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to say that very, very clearly.

2377
03:56:56,119 --> 03:56:56,739
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah.

2378
03:56:57,100 --> 03:56:57,280
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2379
03:56:57,880 --> 03:56:59,401
[SPEAKER_24]: To me, I think is best.

2380
03:57:00,082 --> 03:57:01,002
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I agree.

2381
03:57:01,102 --> 03:57:01,903
[SPEAKER_37]: I just

2382
03:57:03,143 --> 03:57:09,024
[SPEAKER_37]: All I'm saying is, is that even though I reviewed it, this is all fresh to somebody like me.

2383
03:57:09,164 --> 03:57:21,727
[SPEAKER_37]: I haven't been, you know, I even printed this out because I have a big printer and I looked at all, but it's still very complicated material.

2384
03:57:22,187 --> 03:57:28,848
[SPEAKER_37]: So any questions, if we could collect the questions directly to you, Alicia.

2385
03:57:29,462 --> 03:57:34,905
[SPEAKER_37]: And this would be the first thing we would bring for the meeting order.

2386
03:57:36,607 --> 03:57:37,247
[SPEAKER_37]: We might get

2387
03:57:38,320 --> 03:57:39,301
[SPEAKER_37]: get there quicker.

2388
03:57:40,222 --> 03:57:50,712
[SPEAKER_24]: And if anybody has questions about zoning in general and how it works, if that comes up, like, I'm happy to talk offline or have Emily talk offline.

2389
03:57:51,853 --> 03:57:55,156
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, we shouldn't, you shouldn't be deliberating these things.

2390
03:57:55,656 --> 03:58:00,761
[SPEAKER_24]: But if you don't understand some of the, if you're like, I think I'm confused by how this works at all.

2391
03:58:00,781 --> 03:58:01,942
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, that's,

2392
03:58:03,293 --> 03:58:03,693
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

2393
03:58:03,853 --> 03:58:08,775
[SPEAKER_24]: I was confused before I started digging into this.

2394
03:58:10,635 --> 03:58:23,019
[SPEAKER_37]: The point is, if it's questions like that, or questions specific to something that we're reading as to why it's a yes or a no, we'll just forward that directly to you.

2395
03:58:23,139 --> 03:58:26,180
[SPEAKER_37]: So this way at the next meeting, we can just cut to the chase.

2396
03:58:27,053 --> 03:58:31,516
[SPEAKER_39]: And what I've also found helpful is the presentations with the city council.

2397
03:58:31,636 --> 03:58:37,759
[SPEAKER_39]: Those are recorded on method media, but I haven't had a chance to read, to go through the last one.

2398
03:58:37,779 --> 03:58:47,645
[SPEAKER_39]: So I don't know if anyone else will find that because usually the city councilors will flesh out those questions with, as well, and questions that I have, anyways.

2399
03:58:48,026 --> 03:58:49,266
[SPEAKER_37]: It's a great suggestion.

2400
03:58:50,367 --> 03:58:50,827
[SPEAKER_38]: Danielle?

2401
03:58:53,028 --> 03:58:53,689
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, to the chair.

2402
03:58:54,202 --> 03:59:13,632
[SPEAKER_38]: I was also going to offer anyone who wants to come in and meet or give me a call to discuss anything, because sometimes it's just easier to just talk about some questions, even though I'll say that I hate talking on the phone, but then I will.

2403
03:59:13,792 --> 03:59:18,694
[SPEAKER_38]: It's easier sometimes to explain things and to craft an email.

2404
03:59:21,624 --> 03:59:22,305
[SPEAKER_38]: Lost my train of thought.

2405
03:59:22,465 --> 03:59:24,146
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, yes, the 12th floor meeting.

2406
03:59:24,426 --> 03:59:26,087
[SPEAKER_38]: We also have another doozy on it.

2407
03:59:26,127 --> 03:59:29,410
[SPEAKER_38]: We have the continued public hearing for St.

2408
03:59:29,470 --> 03:59:30,330
[SPEAKER_38]: Clair, 21 St.

2409
03:59:30,370 --> 03:59:30,690
[SPEAKER_38]: Clair.

2410
03:59:31,491 --> 03:59:34,393
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's gonna be a busy one.

2411
03:59:36,695 --> 03:59:41,578
[SPEAKER_38]: So we'll just have to say that.

2412
03:59:41,598 --> 03:59:41,638
[SPEAKER_37]: St.

2413
03:59:41,678 --> 03:59:46,602
[SPEAKER_37]: Clair is December 4th also.

2414
03:59:47,222 --> 03:59:47,583
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2415
03:59:47,603 --> 03:59:48,223
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, wow.

2416
03:59:50,821 --> 03:59:51,782
[SPEAKER_38]: Happy holidays.

2417
03:59:53,343 --> 03:59:57,807
[SPEAKER_38]: So Tufts knows that they might need three meetings, and they're fine with that.

2418
03:59:57,827 --> 03:59:58,988
[SPEAKER_38]: I already told them.

2419
04:00:03,646 --> 04:00:09,628
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes, I was looking to see if I didn't know if you readily had those city council meetings available.

2420
04:00:09,688 --> 04:00:15,129
[SPEAKER_39]: I used to have them right at my desk, but I don't have them just to help with the board so that they're not digging.

2421
04:00:15,929 --> 04:00:21,211
[SPEAKER_39]: This is a public hearing, so I'm not sure if there's any public comments.

2422
04:00:21,691 --> 04:00:26,112
[SPEAKER_39]: So before I even open it up to the public, I'll see if there's any hands raised.

2423
04:00:26,312 --> 04:00:27,112
[SPEAKER_39]: There were earlier.

2424
04:00:27,132 --> 04:00:29,293
[SPEAKER_39]: I totally forgot that part.

2425
04:00:32,369 --> 04:00:39,452
[SPEAKER_39]: There's no hands raised, so I'm not even sure that I need to... Do I need to open it to public legally?

2426
04:00:41,892 --> 04:00:42,813
[SPEAKER_39]: There's no hands raised.

2427
04:00:46,174 --> 04:00:52,776
[SPEAKER_39]: Yeah, just to make sure that we're well within legal... You kind of just did that.

2428
04:00:52,816 --> 04:00:54,457
[SPEAKER_24]: You said open it to public comment.

2429
04:00:55,017 --> 04:00:55,297
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay.

2430
04:00:55,397 --> 04:00:57,638
[SPEAKER_39]: And then close it.

2431
04:01:03,100 --> 04:01:03,721
[SPEAKER_39]: There's no one.

2432
04:01:03,741 --> 04:01:11,345
[SPEAKER_39]: All right, then I will, oh, and are there any previously submitted emails or letters on this item?

2433
04:01:15,026 --> 04:01:15,467
[SPEAKER_39]: Danielle?

2434
04:01:16,247 --> 04:01:18,168
[SPEAKER_38]: I haven't received anything.

2435
04:01:18,608 --> 04:01:19,108
[SPEAKER_39]: Anything?

2436
04:01:21,730 --> 04:01:22,330
[SPEAKER_39]: Okay, I will.

2437
04:01:26,692 --> 04:01:28,013
[SPEAKER_39]: I will close the public comment.

2438
04:01:31,327 --> 04:01:41,252
[SPEAKER_39]: And at this point, then I will ask for a motion to continue to a date certain of 12-4-24.

2439
04:01:41,652 --> 04:01:43,313
[SPEAKER_33]: So moved.
