Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:32,991
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:35,492
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:46,024
Hey, thanks so much for being here with me today or having me into the store.

10
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:51,769
If we could just start out by introducing yourself, so just say your name and pronouns and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:54,451
All right, so my name is Brian Smith.

12
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:56,113
I'm a middle school history teacher.

13
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:58,415
I use he, him pronouns.

14
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:04,140
And with my wife, Michelle, we are the owners of Moon and Back Bookstore here in West Bedford.

15
00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:14,373
Great, thank you, and we might hear some background noise because we are at the bookstore right now with your two kids and one of mine, so apologies for any disruptions.

16
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:18,957
We want the store to be a place where kids can be kids, so they're going to be kids.

17
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:19,698
Right, yeah.

18
00:01:20,138 --> 00:01:20,378
Great.

19
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:33,584
So if we could start out by answering the question that we ask everybody on the podcast, and you're like nicely situated here in West Medford amongst a lot of restaurants, but what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

20
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:39,286
So the place I go the most is right around the corner in West Medford is Lola's Coffee.

21
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,687
Probably every time I come into the bookstore, I grab an iced coffee from over there.

22
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:50,530
But the food that I'm most excited about is the Honeyaroni Pizza at 4 Pizza.

23
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,231
They do a tremendous bar pizza.

24
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,794
Also, my wife and my son are gluten-free.

25
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,556
Their gluten-free crust is really good.

26
00:01:57,777 --> 00:02:00,280
But the Honeyaroni is my favorite thing in the city.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,741
It's like pepperoni with honey on it?

28
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:09,985
It's a pepperoni pizza with a spicy honey sauce, so it has like a perfect amount of sweet and spicy mixed together.

29
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,106
Yeah, hot honey is very on trend these days.

30
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,447
Yeah, I know it really is.

31
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:17,129
It was the first time I think I had it was from there, and I get it every time I can.

32
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:21,732
Yeah, you did share before we started recording that you're from the South Shore, so I imagine that's the bar pizza.

33
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:23,113
Yeah, the bar pizza.

34
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:25,754
Between that and the gluten-free, it's a perfect spot for us.

35
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:33,133
And so, so speaking of the moon and back, could you share a little bit about kind of how you and your wife arrived here?

36
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,615
What made you decide to have it a children's bookstore?

37
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:46,858
Yeah, so after, I have two sons, ages six and four, and so my wife was deciding, you know, okay, going back into the workforce, you know, what are we going to do?

38
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:49,780
And she had worked in a variety of industries before.

39
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,745
She was a pastry chef, she was a project manager, and she just wasn't excited to join either of those two fields again.

40
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:56,886
So it was like, all right, what should we do?

41
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,587
What is, what's exciting for her?

42
00:02:58,647 --> 00:02:59,528
And she kind of

43
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,792
casually said to the boys, like, what should mommy do?

44
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:05,615
And my older son Oliver was like, you should be a book helper.

45
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:10,161
And Michelle started thinking about it more and more and was like, well, I love books.

46
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:18,911
You know, the West Medford area doesn't have a bookstore and maybe that's something that we could do.

47
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:20,152
So she started kind of

48
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:25,564
We would spend our evenings, you know, background TV on and looking at spreadsheets.

49
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:29,126
And Michelle was doing all the background work in advance of the bookstore.

50
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:35,170
We were like, all right, five, six years down the road, you know, we'll do it then when things settle down and get easier.

51
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,250
And...

52
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:53,339
this location came available and it was the absolute perfect location I mean we were so excited for it to be so close to us so close to the boys school so close to an ice cream shop as you you know as you mentioned West Medford has so much to offer and

53
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:59,515
one thing turned into another, and it came through actually really, really quickly.

54
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:05,159
It was gonna be a five-year plan turned into a six-month plan.

55
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,943
We got the keys on January 1st, and we were open for business on February 1st.

56
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:17,397
Yeah, and then maybe you can hear outside.

57
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,738
My son is very interested in the books here.

58
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:35,881
And so I guess, you know, I think that books, there's like a lot of meaning, right, to books, especially books for kids, especially like at a time like we're going through right now in our country and politically where books can be sort of a hot, sort of hot button issue and talking about like book bans and what we teach our kids through reading.

59
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:43,843
And so I'm wondering if there's any sort of like mission that's driving your work for this bookstore or anything that you want people to get out of coming here.

60
00:04:45,964 --> 00:05:08,536
We want it to place, I mean, if you look at the bags that we have, I think it's, they say, you know, to be loved or, you know, where every kid feels like there's a book they can feel loved by in this store so that whether they are, whatever their feelings are, whatever their, they're reflected in this store, they're identified in this store.

61
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:14,039
And so we make sure that there are, you know, a variety of books that you don't get to see in,

62
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,157
you know, you're not going to see them at kind of a big box store.

63
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:27,443
The authors are a different, you know, a little bit different and a little bit more unique and you get a better selection of stories.

64
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:36,189
When we go through the, you know, we really try to make sure that our books are eco-friendly as best we can for our toys and for our books.

65
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,093
We try to make sure that, you know, if we have any, make sure that

66
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:49,130
we're getting just a more unique style of author that you might see at a Barnes & Noble or another kind of big box store.

67
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:53,932
Yeah, just browsing, I saw like you had different books for like gay pride.

68
00:05:53,972 --> 00:05:57,433
I saw on your Instagram that you were doing something for like allergy awareness.

69
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:04,715
Yeah, so we have, we have, I think pride reading is coming up on, we have a book called Pride is Love.

70
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:08,917
And we're doing Pride is Love story time, I believe on this Wednesday.

71
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:12,434
So that's 1030 every Wednesday.

72
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:13,495
I just recorded.

73
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:14,855
I probably won't be out by then.

74
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,235
But so we have yeah, we have that sort of time coming up.

75
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:21,296
We have two shelves that kind of to reflect different.

76
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:33,398
I don't see different identities, but different whatever different groups are being celebrated, you know, so whether it was I think right now, I think May is Asian Pacific Heritage Month as well as Allergy Awareness Month.

77
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:34,558
We have two shelves for that.

78
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:38,659
So kind of there's often a group and I work at a public school.

79
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:39,899
So there's often a group that we're kind of

80
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,827
trying to raise more awareness of, more knowledge of.

81
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:44,830
And so there's two shelves for that all the time.

82
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,294
And those books don't, they don't go in the, you know, back in the box afterwards.

83
00:06:48,314 --> 00:06:50,317
They just kind of re-enter the shelves.

84
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:51,779
You know, they're always there in the shelves.

85
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,283
But there's moments they get kind of pulled out and celebrated.

86
00:06:56,344 --> 00:07:00,125
given more visibility.

87
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:08,848
It's always striking to me whenever I travel somewhere and visit the local library to see what they have on display, I think it tells you a lot about who's welcome there, right?

88
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:12,930
And so it sounds like you're all trying to create this really welcoming space.

89
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:27,001
And I think that's like sort of my interest here and like whenever I talk to somebody about what they're doing in Medford It's usually there they've identified some sort of need or something that they're interested in that Maybe they don't see enough of in the city and wanting to kind of bring that to us.

90
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:32,885
And so I'm wondering sort of what you're hoping That the city gets from having a bookstore like this.

91
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,647
Yeah, I mean a bookstore is a

92
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:40,073
It's it's the bookstore is a place where anybody can come in.

93
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,734
And I mean, people who read books are like the nicest people in the world.

94
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:53,336
Whenever I find myself working in the store and I, you know, I find myself, I say I joke to my wife that, you know, if I make a mistake, well, you've read a bookstore.

95
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:54,636
It's the nicest people in the world.

96
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:55,377
We're going to be here.

97
00:07:55,417 --> 00:08:01,198
And so we think for what Medford can gain from a place like this is a place where

98
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:04,391
kids feel welcomed, where kids are celebrated.

99
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:10,896
You know, there's a lot of places that they accept kids and they tolerate kids, but they don't necessarily celebrate kids.

100
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:20,083
And so, you know, sometimes parents will come in and the kid will run to a, you know, will start running over and they're starting touching stuff and they're grabbing stuff.

101
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:24,006
And the parent's like, hey, like, you know, don't grab everything.

102
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:27,549
And it's like, well, we want people to be respectful of the stuff we have here.

103
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,030
Like we want the kids to be kids.

104
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,552
The shelves are purposefully

105
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:34,086
designs that kids can explore themselves.

106
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:52,947
You know we have multiple chairs and places where hopefully kids will sit down and thumb through a book and learn about it or we have one of my favorite spots is the couch where you see you know younger kids reading with their parent or grandparent or just another kind of loving adult in their life and it's just a nice thing to have that in a

107
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,962
That's basically kind of a good spot to hang out in there.

108
00:08:57,422 --> 00:09:08,585
Michelle is, we're organizing, my wife Michelle is organizing a few other, trying to make sure that our events that we're doing are representative of the full city.

109
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:15,267
You know, so that if, you know, on one day that there is a space where over the course of say a two month period,

110
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:21,116
Every kid feels like, oh, that's a story time that's for me, that I feel happy with, that I feel reflected in.

111
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:27,064
The person who's doing the story time and the story they're reading, you know, I can see myself in that story time.

112
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:28,346
That's cool.

113
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:30,128
I think, yes, in addition to kind of

114
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:45,180
supporting like young readers we did have we had Kat Bacardi on the podcast a couple weeks ago and she's like a local teacher and author and so yeah I think it's it's also cool to see that like local folks are writing books that you guys are selling here and doing readings which is really cool.

115
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,526
Yeah we also had Kat Bacardi in to do a reading here so we have a whole local author section and we've had a lot of the local authors come through and

116
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,769
you know, do readings here and do other kind of events here.

117
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:13,975
Um, we are, we're, we're doing our second, um, our second week, we have a community table where we're hoping that kids will start to come in and be able to pick their own, um, their own recommendations.

118
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:24,439
So we did, I mean, we're, you know, my niece did the first one and my son did the second one, but we're eventually going to open it up to, you know, just people that have come into the store a few times and say, Hey, these are the,

119
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:41,693
eight stories that I really like the most and here's what I, you know, they get to pick them out, they get to, you know, write out why they like them if they want and, you know, kind of have that space where they feel a little bit of ownership over the, over what's being reflected here and what's being offered in the store.

120
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:42,494
I love that.

121
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:50,856
That's kind of like, like an alternative to like staff picks and you see like, yeah, yeah, it kind of is exactly that idea is that, you know, let the kid feel so,

122
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:59,862
I don't know, you get to be excited to come back in here and be like, hey, this is, it's not just a place I go to buy books or a place where I feel like I have a part of what's going on.

123
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:00,162
Yeah.

124
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:06,705
I remember like growing up, we had like an ice cream store that displayed all the like local sports teams, like if they won something.

125
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:07,986
This feels equivalent, right?

126
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:12,888
It's like, this is like an honor to have your books, like to have your opinion reflected in the local books.

127
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:13,188
Yeah.

128
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,829
And it, you know, while as,

129
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:23,276
I think it's a really big deal to a six or seven or eight year old to pick their books out and it's important to say, all right, what's important to me?

130
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:28,280
I want to put it up on the table and hopefully other people will find it to be important as well.

131
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:36,047
And as a parent whose kids get really fixated on like one or two books, it's nice to see like what other kids are reading and enjoying to expose them to as well.

132
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:37,689
I think it's, yeah, I mean you end up

133
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:50,854
end up falling into the trap of okay my kid likes trucks and then all you get are truck books and it's like I want exposure to something different with other kids of this age enjoying and liking.

134
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:52,375
Do you have a favorite book?

135
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:53,295
Favorite kids book?

136
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,877
My favorite kids book and maybe it's because

137
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,135
we had this book called Digger, Dozer, Dumper.

138
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:04,836
And when you're in the truck book stage, the books can get a little monotonous.

139
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:12,399
And this was like 15 or 16 different poems and different styles of poems for each truck.

140
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:20,701
So it was a way to kind of break some of the monotony of like the dump truck dumps and the excavator digs.

141
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,982
It was a really cool way to not only

142
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:26,139
It was a way to introduce my kids to some poetry.

143
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,901
Unexpectedly, you know, instead of being here, read poetry.

144
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:31,443
I was like, nope, we're gonna read this book about a skid steer.

145
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:34,485
And it just happens to be, you know, very poetic.

146
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:47,135
And I imagine as a teacher, I feel like my kids come home saying, like talking about like this, like different kinds of poetry that they're learning of like, how did a teacher get my kid who only wants to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid?

147
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:48,516
Like, how did they get them into that?

148
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:49,797
But that sounds really cool.

149
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:59,763
Yeah, I think I teach, you know, having, teaching middle school, some of the best teaching is done when you've found a way to make it not feel like teaching or feel like learning.

150
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:07,307
That's the, when you can get the best bar, which again, a book on poetry, but it's, the kid thinks it's about trucks, but they're being exposed to poetry.

151
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:07,767
Cool.

152
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:07,987
Yeah.

153
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:08,688
Well, I'm excited.

154
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,889
I think I liked the plug for Lola's in the beginnings.

155
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,630
I love a combination bookstore, coffee shop.

156
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:14,331
So it's nice to.

157
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:19,374
The amount of people who have said you should add a, you know, a food or coffee element to the store.

158
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:32,059
And it just, there's so much already in West Medford that we didn't, we didn't need it to be in our space, you know, because we have so many good places between Lola's and the muffin shop.

159
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,200
And, you know, we just not, we didn't need another spot.

160
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,540
Yeah.

161
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,561
And I imagine it would have taken you a lot longer to open if you were doing that.

162
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:40,762
And it would have taken us a lot longer to open.

163
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:46,044
And I think if you would have talked to Michelle and I, one of the things we would say is instead of doing two things,

164
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:49,046
Averagely, we'd rather do one thing really well.

165
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:54,111
And so the full focus is just on the books.

166
00:13:54,151 --> 00:14:00,977
And I think if we had tried to do two things, we wouldn't have been able to give as much energy to this specific book selection.

167
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:03,019
That's one of the things I love when I see

168
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:11,236
kids come in and they've been here before and they just be aligned to the section that they know because the store is organized.

169
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:16,218
If you've got a chance to explore, the store is organized by section, not by author names or anything like that.

170
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:28,443
So, you know, there's a whole bookshelf of just dinosaur books and a whole bookshelf of just truck books and the kids come in and they know like, all right, I'm going straight to the truck, I'm going straight to the sea creatures, I'm going straight to the dinosaurs, whatever it is that they're

171
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:34,046
interested in that month, which is kind of a cool thing to see them open the door and be excited.

172
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,166
Yeah, that's great.

173
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:39,228
And, you know, I think it sounds like your sons probably spend a fair amount of time here.

174
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:45,652
I wonder if you've thought about kind of what you want them to take away from being raised in a bookstore.

175
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:53,376
Yeah, I think there's, one, it's the importance of books, which they already kind of get at home, but to see, you know, they're here, they're so much exposed to books.

176
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:54,657
The other thing is that

177
00:14:55,681 --> 00:15:08,967
they're seeing, especially their mom, take a big risk in doing this and saying, you know what, I could have gone back into a job that was fine, but that I wasn't excited about.

178
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,610
And instead of doing that, I want to do something that not only I'm excited about, but

179
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,712
that directly, positively, hopefully impacts the community that we live in.

180
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:26,935
You know, my son can walk to school from here, we can walk from our home to here, like it's not, it is our neighborhood.

181
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:33,738
We walk past, you know, it's our neighborhood and we want it to be, it's exactly what we want inside of our neighborhood.

182
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:35,179
Yeah, it's very cool.

183
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,724
I imagine too growing up to like your friends know that like your family has the bookstore and they can visit you there and it's really cool.

184
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:42,644
Right.

185
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:47,908
Well, is there anything that I haven't asked you or anything that we haven't talked about that you think you want people to know?

186
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,750
Yeah, we've said two exciting things coming out.

187
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,572
One thing that's planned and one thing we're hoping to do in the future.

188
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:57,495
We are part of in July is like Where's Waldo month.

189
00:15:58,295 --> 00:15:59,836
So we are part of

190
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:05,020
this big Where's Waldo celebration.

191
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,560
So it's going to be all month.

192
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,762
We're partnering with 25 other businesses in the city of Medford.

193
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:11,884
We'll be hiding little Waldo guys.

194
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:19,168
And if you collect all of them, you get to come into the store and get some prizes from the Waldo Corporation as well as us.

195
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:26,172
And it ends with a big party, a big Where's Waldo celebration on August 2nd here at the store.

196
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:26,892
Cool.

197
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:28,893
So it's kind of a fun thing to be

198
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:34,515
kind of connecting with 25 different businesses.

199
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:39,958
You know, so we talk about how great West Medford is, but we obviously want to serve the entire city and the whole community.

200
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:45,242
So we'll be connecting with a lot of different businesses that way, which is really cool.

201
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:51,726
And one thing that we're excited about that we've been kicking around the city and we don't have a plan for it yet, but you mentioned what we want are, you know, for the community.

202
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:54,508
We have this idea to do

203
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,786
like a, almost like a kid's maker fair.

204
00:16:58,506 --> 00:17:05,310
So that like neighborhood kids that like make their little things almost like a bigger organized like yard sale for kids.

205
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:09,352
So they can make their stuff, come in here, sell it to think it would be the community.

206
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:22,598
But again, to feel like, you know, especially talk about kids being able to be kids, but also that, you know, young people are so capable and are independent and kind of grow some of that independence as well.

207
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:23,567
That's really cool.

208
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:24,868
I'm sure there'll be a lot of interest.

209
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:25,748
I think so.

210
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:33,674
I mean, people come in and they talk about, you know, kids are here that are here regularly telling us of the stuff that they're making, the bookmarks that they're making, the cards that they're making.

211
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:38,618
And whenever we do a craft, kids always want to share the other stuff they're doing at home as well.

212
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:43,802
So kind of a fun way to, I don't know, become more connected with our community.

213
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,102
Yeah.

214
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:45,804
Well, I'll be on the lookout for that.

215
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:46,845
Hopefully you'll be back.

216
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:47,485
Yeah.

217
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:49,166
Well, thank you so much for your time today.

218
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:49,767

219
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:50,287
No, thank you.

220
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:52,009
