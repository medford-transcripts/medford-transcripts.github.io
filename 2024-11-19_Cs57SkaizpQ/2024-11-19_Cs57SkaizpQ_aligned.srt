1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,572
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:06,652 --> 00:00:09,014
The 37th regular meeting of the Memphis City Council.

3
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:10,375
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

4
00:00:31,442 --> 00:00:34,466
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

5
00:00:34,506 --> 00:00:34,906
Please rise.

6
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:54,736
The motion by Vice President Knight to suspend the rules.

7
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:57,138
We have a representative here from Local 25, Mr. President.

8
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:58,899
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

9
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,300
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

10
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:04,962
Yes.

11
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:05,143
Yes.

12
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:05,583
Yes.

13
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:05,983
Yes.

14
00:01:07,664 --> 00:01:07,904
Yes.

15
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:09,705
Absence.

16
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:18,669
President Aviello.

17
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:19,930
Yes.

18
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,290
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

19
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,251
Motion passes.

20
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:28,713
Mr. President, the reason I ask for the rooms to be suspended is to invite Stephen South from Local 25 up to the podium.

21
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:31,774
He's here this evening to join us with a special announcement, I do believe.

22
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:38,856
I was contacted by his office earlier in the week, and he asked that he be extended this courtesy this evening as the official bargaining agent for a number of units here in the community.

23
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:40,296
Thank you.

24
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:43,778
Good evening.

25
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:44,738
Name and address of the record, please.

26
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:53,593
25 but coincidentally I also live at 106 Damon Road in Medford.

27
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,595
Thank you, sir.

28
00:01:55,155 --> 00:02:03,606
Good evening, Mr. Chairman Good evening, counselors, just wanted to talk briefly with all of you about an issue.

29
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:06,570
It's been brought to my attention first in the summer.

30
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:16,376
And then over the last few weeks that the city has hired private investigators to follow multiple members of my bargaining units.

31
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:23,801
We've put in a request for information to the city asking for the scope and who's ordered this.

32
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:30,205
I think I'm aware of who it is, but I wanna see if the council is aware that any of this is going on.

33
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,690
I am not aware.

34
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:35,212
I don't know, I can't speak for the other councils.

35
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:46,759
And is there a line item in the budget that provides the city with money to, in the tens of thousands of dollars, to pay for private investigators to follow your employees?

36
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,199
None that I'm aware of.

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:03:08,360
Okay, well we've requested a whole slew of information over a month ago we we've received very little of it but we'll, we'll do our due diligence, obviously we're entitled to that information but I wanted to see if first if you were aware of it the Council, and if not, you know, obviously we feel that it's very inappropriate.

38
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:12,964
We think that it's more of a fishing expedition.

39
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:24,354
There's been no credible allegations brought to our attention, but I know that the city's conducting multiple investigations that are, like I said, a fishing expedition.

40
00:03:24,394 --> 00:03:28,058
But I appreciate your time, and hopefully we can get to the bottom of this.

41
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:28,738
Thank you.

42
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:29,399
Thank you.

43
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,542
Before you, any questions for Mr. Sotheby's here?

44
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:49,561
Mr. President, I do believe I do believe Mr. South has had the opportunity to organize several bargaining units here in the community, maybe you could tell us a little bit about that I know we were able to recently approve the contract for our inspectors and recreation department.

45
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:56,867
Yes, and we just filed for another group last week of the, the, this part of the school committee but it's the.

46
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:03,165
assistant principals, the department heads and the administrators and all of the Medford public schools.

47
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:06,627
That's the seventh group that we've organized in the last seven years.

48
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:14,049
So we look forward to continuing a strong relationship that we had for many years with the city.

49
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:18,611
We're hoping that can continue and continue our bargaining relationship.

50
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:23,793
And obviously we do a lot in the community and share a lot of interests with all of you.

51
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:30,498
and our families and we look forward to continuing that partnership with the city of Medford, and local 25.

52
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:31,019
Thank you.

53
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,343
Thank you, Mr. President, just one more item Mr. President, before I wrap up, just one more item.

54
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,826
It's also been brought to my attention was the self that you've been able to organize.

55
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:45,750
a private entity that provides transportation services to our students here in the community?

56
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:46,851
Yes.

57
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,072
And you're in the process of negotiating a contract now?

58
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:52,994
Up until recently, that's no longer the case.

59
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,075
Is the contract been negotiated or?

60
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:57,196
No, they've been released.

61
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:57,936
They've been released.

62
00:04:58,057 --> 00:04:58,257
Yes.

63
00:04:58,497 --> 00:04:59,417
So that's done.

64
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:01,358
Thank you.

65
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:02,779
Thank you, Mr. President.

66
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,600
Certainly want to get to the bottom of this.

67
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:10,263
I just wanted to add congratulations to you and all of your members on the election of Sean O'Brien as the

68
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:11,995
President of National Teamsters.

69
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:13,637
Thank you very much, Mr. Bares.

70
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:14,378
I appreciate that.

71
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:17,602
Any other questions?

72
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:19,993
Thank you, sir.

73
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:21,254
I thank you all for your time.

74
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:21,974
Have a nice evening.

75
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:22,394
Thank you very much.

76
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:25,715
Mr. President, I do believe that this council has asked this question in the past.

77
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:33,958
This was something that I put forward a number of months ago, requesting that the administration disclose to us if there's any type of investigation going on.

78
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:39,260
I believe this was something that got brought up maybe in, oh, May or June, if I'm not mistaken.

79
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:48,663
With that being said, maybe it would be possible for the city clerk to provide us with a copy of that paper and the other response that the administration gave, and then we can forward that to Mr. Self as well.

80
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:49,403
Thank you.

81
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:53,295
All right, motion to revert back to regular business.

82
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:58,159
Motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

83
00:05:58,179 --> 00:05:59,240
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

84
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,102
Councilor Behrs?

85
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:02,202
Yes.

86
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:03,983
Councilor Falcone?

87
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:04,303
Yes.

88
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:05,865
Vice President Knight?

89
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:08,447
Yes.

90
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:09,868
Councilor Ntuk?

91
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:10,348
Yes.

92
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:12,029
Councilor Larao?

93
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:12,109
Yes.

94
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:14,371
Councilor Stephanopoulos?

95
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:14,731
Yes.

96
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:16,272
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

97
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,994
Do we still have to call the roll if George is not on the meeting?

98
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:21,768
Yeah, so yeah, we don't, we won't scroll around today.

99
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:22,089
Thank you.

100
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:22,811
I wasn't sure.

101
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:41,431
21619 off of my Vice President Knight and President Caravagno, be it so resolved that the Memphis City Council thank the Sloan family and all of the Century Bank staff for their philanthropy and contributions to the city of Memphis.

102
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:42,111
Vice President Knight.

103
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,672
Mr. President, thank you very much.

104
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:49,834
Just this past week, we had a very monumental transfer of ownership of Century Bank over to Eastern Bank.

105
00:06:50,395 --> 00:06:55,397
And seeing this happen, it brought some sadness, whereas I've had the ability and

106
00:06:56,457 --> 00:07:02,939
fortunate responsibility to work with the Sloan family now, going back to when I first got involved in government in the late 90s.

107
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:13,461
The Sloan family have been great, great, great advocates, great participants in our community, great benefactors, very generous people that have really helped make Medfed a better place.

108
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:24,044
They've invested not only their money, but also their time, their energy, and their efforts here to create jobs, to run a successful business, to build and develop,

109
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:29,311
and help grow our community, but they've also been very philanthropic in nature.

110
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:34,515
And because of that, Mr. President, I offer this resolution and I thank you for co-sponsoring it with me.

111
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:46,784
And I'd ask my council colleagues if we could be so kind as to extend the slightest bit of gratitude to the Sloan family based upon their 40 plus years of dedication and commitment to this community.

112
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:48,844
Thank you, Mr. President.

113
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,567
Personally, I've known the Sloan family for many years.

114
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,049
Marshall Sloan, a citizen of the year.

115
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,693
Barry and his sister have been great community members.

116
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:06,457
Their philanthropy throughout the community has been second to none.

117
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:12,101
Their room at the top of the bank, they gave to everybody that used, paid for everyone's dinners there.

118
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:13,742
I mean, let's say,

119
00:08:15,588 --> 00:08:21,411
The family who started with a small bank in Somerville and grown to one of the largest banks in New England, privately held.

120
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:35,859
And again, I talked to Barry all the time and I wished him well personally, but again, I wanna wish everybody, Barry and his whole family, great success on whatever him and Linda decided to do going forward.

121
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:42,202
And we welcome Eastern Bank into our community and hope they'll be the same kind of partner that the Sloans were.

122
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:43,863
Thank you.

123
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:51,272
So, on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

124
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:52,354
All those in favor?

125
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:56,119
Motion passes.

126
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:01,988
2-1-6-2-0, offered by Councilor Moxon, President Cabrera, be it resolved that the office of the Memphis City Clerk be discussed.

127
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:02,649
Councilor Moxon.

128
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:08,435
Thank you Mr. President, I want to thank you for co-sponsoring this resolution.

129
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:21,045
I offer this resolution tonight Mr. President to get some clarification on some recent happenings within the City Clerk

130
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:23,507
and the registrar voters office.

131
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:36,301
As you may or may not be aware, the election process this year, during both the preliminary election and the general election in November,

132
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,692
were called into question regarding the review of voter list.

133
00:09:43,632 --> 00:10:05,940
And it's my belief that the Secretary of State's office, in particular the election division, was reviewing a list that was submitted by the city back a few months ago to inactivate a number of registered voters in this community.

134
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:14,758
Now, that process, I am not aware of where it stands, and that's the reason why I'm offering this tonight, Mr. President.

135
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:20,763
However, what I am aware, and not through any formal communication from

136
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:50,273
the city administration is that there is currently an external third party audit that's being taken place, I guess, as we speak by an external party of which I believe it was initiated by KP Law, who is a vendor, nothing more than a vendor for this community.

137
00:10:51,621 --> 00:11:02,323
So I'm not quite sure the KP law has the authority to initiate an audit on a department within

138
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:04,287
city government here.

139
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,249
That's the first question I would have.

140
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:12,773
And secondly, the extent of what this audit is going to involve.

141
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:21,479
I'm under the impression it involves the city clerk's office slightly, mostly the registrar voters office.

142
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:30,426
And I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President, where we are responsible for hiring of the city clerk.

143
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:38,732
The city clerk in his capacity is not only the city clerk, he's also the chief election officer under our charter.

144
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:43,795
And I think it's only appropriate that we as the hiring authority

145
00:11:44,957 --> 00:12:00,912
find out why KP Law, a contractor that works for the city authorized an external party to come in and do an audit of the city clerk's slash registrar voters office.

146
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:09,000
So at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that we have a committee of the whole meeting to bring us up to date.

147
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:35,128
I would assume, and I wasn't privy to any of these meetings that were held over the last couple of weeks, but I would assume we would have to invite someone from the city administration and they would be aware of who actually should be invited and who took part in these meetings that were held that the Memphis City Council was not privy to.

148
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:51,265
Mr. President, in order to ask the questions I have, I won't ask them tonight, but I have a laundry list of questions on where this audit stands, why it was initiated, by who, for what purpose, Mr. President, and the list goes on and on.

149
00:12:52,240 --> 00:13:14,305
So that's what I'm gonna put in the form of a motion that we set up a committee of the whole meeting within the next, and I realize it's the holiday, but maybe sometime after Thanksgiving, Mr. President, if we could set that up, a committee of the whole meeting to discuss the ongoing audit that's being done in the clerk slash elections department.

150
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:15,225
Thank you.

151
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:16,345
Thank you, Mr. President.

152
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,765
I can give you the information that I know.

153
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:34,668
KP Law has an election expert on their team, and they are looking to, the word audit wasn't used, we're to review the clerk's office.

154
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:48,459
And from what I understand, they're looking to hire two clerks from two towns, I'm sorry, two cities to conduct this review.

155
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,479
I don't know which,

156
00:13:50,523 --> 00:14:02,852
I don't know if they've hired anybody or, or if it's already started I can't give you that information I'm not privy to that point of information, Mr. President, what information vice president, I do believe by a vote of seven to nothing this Memphis City Council cut KP law out of the budget.

157
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:04,353
How are they being paid.

158
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:06,735
I cannot answer how they're being paid.

159
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:10,697
So, so but let me let me go back to what I was saying.

160
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:19,300
They are looking to bring in two clerks from two other cities to review our clerk's office.

161
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:28,243
I guess this has been done in the past in other cities, according to the Lori Goldberg of KP Law.

162
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:33,424
So that is all the information that I know at this point.

163
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:39,466
I don't know if it has started or if they've hired anybody to actually start this review.

164
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:41,947
Councilor Morelle.

165
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:43,277
Thank you, Mr. President.

166
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:51,499
As we've run into this issue recently, I would just ask if that it's anticipated we'll be discussing any personnel or any individual- We will not be discussing any personnel matters this evening.

167
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:52,819
Oh, not tonight.

168
00:14:52,959 --> 00:15:01,861
In this upcoming committee of the whole, just ensuring if anyone's going to be discussed that they are given the proper notice and invited so we don't have our hands tied.

169
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,622
They will be notified properly if a personnel matter is going to be discussed.

170
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:07,503
Okay, thank you.

171
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:08,584
Mr. President, if I could.

172
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:10,685
Vice President Senator, Councilor Marks.

173
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:13,007
And I appreciate that update.

174
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:16,590
And I know you weren't part of all the meetings that took place.

175
00:15:17,591 --> 00:15:28,780
However, to me, the larger issue is how does a vendor, this is a vendor, initiate an audit of a city department?

176
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:35,646
I don't think there's any precedent anywhere that a vendor would have that authority.

177
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:39,402
So that's my first question.

178
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:45,937
Who and what capacity does KP law have to initiate

179
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:49,350
I call it an audit, you could call it a review.

180
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,593
I'm just using the terms that I was given.

181
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:54,434
Right, right.

182
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:58,197
So that would be my question.

183
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:12,248
And prior to anything happening, Mr. President, where the only authority that we have for hiring in this community, out of the hundreds of positions, we're responsible for the city clerk.

184
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:19,728
One position, we're not even responsible for the people that work within the city clerk's office.

185
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:28,455
We have no hiring authority over the people that actually work for the city clerk, but our one responsibility is the city clerk.

186
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:39,065
And he runs the day-to-day operations of the clerk's office and is responsible for the oversight of the registrar of voters office.

187
00:16:40,637 --> 00:17:01,797
How are we not brought into the conversation when a review slash audit is requested by a vendor, as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, that may not even be a vendor because we slashed them from the budget in June.

188
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:05,838
So there's a lot that needs to be answered, Mr. President.

189
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:09,318
I hope we can get those answers answered tonight.

190
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:21,661
We had Mr. Salt up here tonight talking about, you know, who authorized private investigators to follow around DPW workers.

191
00:17:22,102 --> 00:17:23,042
Was that in the budget?

192
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:27,683
These are questions, Mr. President, that we need answered as a community.

193
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:29,804
and they're very important questions.

194
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:35,289
This is one of them, Mr President, and I would hope we set up that meeting immediately.

195
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,592
That will be next week, right after the holiday.

196
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:39,333
It will be next week, Mr President.

197
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:40,654
A second question.

198
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:46,620
We pay our own city solicitor, Solicitor Kim Scanlon.

199
00:17:48,286 --> 00:18:08,051
who served as assistant city solicitor for a number of years, a very capable attorney, very knowledgeable of city ordinances, city charter, but yet we have a private vendor that comes in and starts investigating.

200
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:10,192
I won't call it an investigation.

201
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:14,673
I know they get a little antsy when we say investigation,

202
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:22,465
but hires two clerks to come in and do a review slash audit.

203
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,246
Where's our city solicitor?

204
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:31,490
That's supposed to be the oversight, the legal oversight for this community.

205
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,252
Was this signed off by the city solicitor?

206
00:18:38,768 --> 00:19:00,387
So I, right, so you can see where this is going, Mr. President, that we can have a rogue entity that has nothing to do with this community other than the fact that they're a hired vendor, stop auditing and investigating departments and employees and policies and procedures.

207
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:05,632
It makes no sense at all, no sense at all.

208
00:19:08,091 --> 00:19:14,535
And I realized this is a touchy subject because some of this was initiated because of an election.

209
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:27,925
And the people that are running this community ran in that election and they have to probably recuse themselves from being involved in any review, which I understand.

210
00:19:30,008 --> 00:19:31,609
but we don't leave it up to a vendor.

211
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,631
We don't leave it up to a vendor, Mr. President.

212
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:35,972
That makes no sense.

213
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,515
So really, I hope next week, I appreciate that, Mr. President.

214
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:49,962
I appreciate everything you've done on this issue to keep me as one member of the council informed to the best of your ability, but we really need answers.

215
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,464
Thank you, Mr. President.

216
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:54,305
Thank you.

217
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:59,128
Mr. President, I do think it's also important to point out that we have

218
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:01,759
a board of registrar voters.

219
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:17,302
And I think that, you know, they've been left out of this process for pretty, pretty open to the point where they two of the three members resigned during the election process this year.

220
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:26,304
So I think there's a, you know, something that's definitely worth discussing, Mr. President, and I support Council Marx's resolution and I will move to second it this evening.

221
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:27,610
Thank you.

222
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,171
Councilor Falcone.

223
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:29,211
Thank you, Mr. President.

224
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,893
I want to thank you and Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

225
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:36,837
I found this process to be very frustrating.

226
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:44,722
I feel that right now I know myself as a council, I have more questions than answers and that's not your fault.

227
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:46,683
I agree with Councilor Marks.

228
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:52,528
We have an outside entity that's running the show and who's giving them the authority to do this.

229
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:54,389
And

230
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:58,105
Like I said, there's, there's just more questions than answers.

231
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,647
It's just incredibly frustrating.

232
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:09,453
I mean, I know what I would like to see is I'd love to see just a timeline of events, literally from when this whole issue came about.

233
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,754
when the list got messed up and people were deleted, people added back on.

234
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:17,557
I mean, who gave that person the authority to do that?

235
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:19,679
I have so many questions.

236
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,702
I think we'll need more than an hour.

237
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:23,482
As do many people.

238
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,603
We'll do it on a Wednesday.

239
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:30,929
So I would say this should be a Wednesday night meeting just because I don't think this is a meeting that

240
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,411
I don't want to bump into our regular two things.

241
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:34,891
You are correct.

242
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:35,791
That's what I was planning.

243
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:38,511
If you could schedule that on a Wednesday, I think that would be the best bet.

244
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:42,752
Because I know I have a ton of questions, as I'm sure my colleagues do as well.

245
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:46,353
But there are a lot of things, I think, that need to be looked at.

246
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:49,093
It's very frustrating.

247
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,374
Here we are a month later, and we're doing this.

248
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:54,614
But we need to do this as soon as possible.

249
00:21:54,774 --> 00:21:56,655
It'll be next Wednesday.

250
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:57,455
Thank you very much.

251
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:57,995
I appreciate it.

252
00:21:58,255 --> 00:21:58,495
Thank you.

253
00:22:00,331 --> 00:22:01,351
Any other councilors have any questions?

254
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,273
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

255
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,575
Hi, Patricia Daugherty, 235 Winthrop Street.

256
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:24,701
I'm so glad to see this on the agenda tonight because you may or may not know that since the day after the election, there have been a lot of issues about getting information from the city clerk's office and from the register of voters office.

257
00:22:27,443 --> 00:22:28,363
Did any of you know that?

258
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:39,826
Well, normally before the election, campaigns can come and get information freely from the city clerk's office or the register of voters office.

259
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:46,850
And usually after the election, a volunteer will go in and ask for the voter activity list.

260
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:55,034
And so after the September 2nd preliminary, we have got the voter activity list.

261
00:22:55,694 --> 00:23:00,197
And that list is important because it'll allow you to fine tune

262
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,911
the list you'll use in the next mailing.

263
00:23:03,492 --> 00:23:06,354
It tells you who voted, who didn't vote, what parties voted.

264
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:08,275
Point of information, Vice President Knight.

265
00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:09,056
I noticed, Ms.

266
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:10,677
Brady, that you said we.

267
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,780
Are you here representing a group or an organization, or are you here as a citizen?

268
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,242
No, I'm saying as volunteers, as like a volunteer.

269
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:21,385
Do you mean like as a volunteer in general may do this practice?

270
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:22,066
No, I went in there.

271
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:25,589
I went in because I had volunteered on several campaigns this fall.

272
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:27,010
So you're speaking as an individual today.

273
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,852
But at this moment, I'm speaking as me who went in.

274
00:23:30,895 --> 00:23:44,899
So I went in to get, so the day after the November 2nd election, I went in to get the numbers, the unofficial official numbers, and knowing that they are not official until of course they're certified.

275
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:51,241
And I also asked if I could then, when would the voter activity list for November 2nd be ready?

276
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:52,361
Usually that's a week or so.

277
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:54,322
And so they gave a date.

278
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,603
But I also heard when I was down there,

279
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:14,551
that a list of 12,546 people had been moved from active to inactive back to active again before the preliminary election.

280
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:16,852
Now, were you people aware of that?

281
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:24,817
Through the chair, Councilor Mox, you were aware of that?

282
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:25,718
Correct.

283
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:40,290
called the Secretary of State's office and Michelle Tassinieri got back to me and she's chief legal counsel, as many of you might know, and she explained what happened.

284
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:48,298
She said that the city clerk's office had moved 12,546 people to inactive status and

285
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:56,568
then it, but it was done too close to the next election.

286
00:24:57,188 --> 00:25:05,030
So, and I can't remember whether she said notices were sent out or not sent out because what happens is the city does their annual street listing.

287
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,071
And if you don't respond, you then are removed from the active photo list.

288
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:16,512
And, but before they do that, they send a card out to remind you that you didn't fill out your street census.

289
00:25:17,593 --> 00:25:19,313
And so when I was talking to her,

290
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:22,309
She said, but it was too close to the timeline.

291
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:23,629
Someone had filed a complaint.

292
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:26,170
And I said, well, how would they know that?

293
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,351
How would they know that there was anything to complain about?

294
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:34,012
And she said, well, I'm not sure you'd have to find that out from the city clerk's office.

295
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:40,594
So, but the other thing I asked her about is I said, there are 41,000 people registered to vote in the city.

296
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:43,534
And the census says we only have 59,000 people.

297
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:45,315
Doesn't that seem very high to you?

298
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:46,795
And she said, it seems really high.

299
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:48,916
And she said, why don't you go back

300
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:55,924
take out, go to the recent census and take out all the kids, everyone under 18 who can't vote.

301
00:25:56,364 --> 00:26:04,807
And then if you come up with a really high number, then go to your council, go to the registrar's office and suggest that maybe there needs to be some sort of deeper review.

302
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:09,989
So I did what she said, and we came up with a really high number.

303
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:18,753
And just to make sure it wasn't off base, I took Wellesley, which I knew to be a very high,

304
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,110
owner occupied city.

305
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:26,832
And I knew they had very high public participation because they have hundreds of people show up at their town meetings.

306
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,593
And then I thought, well, this is kind of extreme.

307
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:31,593
I'll just go next door to Winchester, the same thing.

308
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:41,816
And so both Wellesley and Winchester have an 80% of their population is registered to vote and they have 90%, give or take, owner occupied.

309
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:42,997
So you would expect that.

310
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:46,558
Well, Medford has 85% of our

311
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,461
population registered to vote.

312
00:26:51,762 --> 00:26:56,385
And that is extremely high because we're only at 56% owner occupied.

313
00:26:57,586 --> 00:27:06,431
So I'm suggesting that there might want to be some investigation into why our we have such a high number registered to vote in the city.

314
00:27:07,912 --> 00:27:10,354
But the other thing is I said to her, well, if

315
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:19,288
We were going to delete 12,546 people from the list that would leave 29,000 people registered to vote.

316
00:27:20,228 --> 00:27:26,713
Listen, that seemed like a really high number to delete and she said it is a really high number, she said you need to ask maybe.

317
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:30,419
the city clerk wasn't deleting the list, cleaning up the list every year.

318
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:34,101
You know, maybe you go back seven or eight years and they hadn't cleaned up the list.

319
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:35,581
And I thought, well, that was unusual.

320
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:36,562
That would be not right.

321
00:27:36,962 --> 00:27:42,024
Well, I happened to run into Ed Finn outside one day and he said, no, we cleaned up the list every year.

322
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:44,065
And he said, I think Adam has been doing it also.

323
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:48,326
So I think another question we have to ask is how did we get to 12,546 people on the list?

324
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:49,247
Maybe that's part of the review.

325
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:55,543
Well, there were a couple more questions here.

326
00:27:56,124 --> 00:28:03,290
So anyway, I waited the week and I walked back into city clerk's office to see if the voter activity list was ready.

327
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,112
And I was told, we can't talk to you.

328
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:08,514
I said, me or everybody?

329
00:28:09,174 --> 00:28:10,015
We can't talk to anyone.

330
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:12,677
And I said, what do you mean you can't talk to anyone?

331
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:14,999
We can't give out any lists, we can't do anything.

332
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:17,581
I said, what do you mean?

333
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:22,325
I was told we could committing, you have the voter activity list, why can't I have it?

334
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,641
And they said, we just can't tell you anything.

335
00:28:26,902 --> 00:28:28,764
I thought, this is really weird.

336
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:32,447
Like normally you only shut down the flow of communication when there's a criminal investigation.

337
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,709
I said, is there a criminal investigation?

338
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:35,510
They said, we can't talk.

339
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,372
So I went down the register of voters office.

340
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:41,875
This is Wednesday, November 10th.

341
00:28:43,196 --> 00:28:45,017
And I said, Sandy Gill was there.

342
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:49,401
And I said, could I get the list I talked about with you last week?

343
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:51,823
And she said, I'm sorry, we can't talk to you.

344
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,840
And I said, what are you talking about?

345
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,481
And no one would look up.

346
00:28:57,581 --> 00:28:58,702
Everyone was really nervous.

347
00:28:59,562 --> 00:29:01,083
And it was the weirdest state of affairs.

348
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:04,945
So I went home, called up seeing Michelle Tassineri again.

349
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:08,608
And she called me back later on.

350
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:11,149
And someone said, we can't talk to you.

351
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,031
The Secretary of State's office said we can't talk to anyone right now.

352
00:29:15,332 --> 00:29:16,493
Oh, I forgot one important thing.

353
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:17,353
So I went upstairs.

354
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:19,114
They said, you got to go to the city solicitor's office.

355
00:29:19,154 --> 00:29:19,775
So I went there.

356
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:21,849
And she was too busy to talk to me.

357
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:25,031
They said, you have to file a freedom of information to get this information.

358
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,473
I said, this is unbelievable.

359
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:30,476
I said, we just got the exact same list like in September.

360
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:42,104
So I went to the mayor's office and there was a meeting going on and I got to go in and I said, can you please tell me under what authority are you shutting down the flow of information?

361
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:44,026
Is there a criminal investigation going on here?

362
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:49,084
And the mayor didn't answer me.

363
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:56,248
I understand that there's some emotions running high, but to keep insinuating, is there a criminal investigation?

364
00:29:56,288 --> 00:29:59,430
Is there a criminal investigation?

365
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:04,633
I'm just thinking that, you know, the narrative is getting a little skewed here.

366
00:30:04,673 --> 00:30:06,354
You know what I mean?

367
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:07,735
Let's keep it to the facts, please.

368
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:08,856
That's all I'm saying.

369
00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:11,437
Is there a criminal investigation?

370
00:30:11,497 --> 00:30:11,978
I mean, come on.

371
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,253
That is the question.

372
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:18,556
That's a very factual statement I made because that's what I said.

373
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:21,599
I said, how are you shutting down the flow of information?

374
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,401
Is there a criminal investigation going on?

375
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:26,144
Because normally that's the only time you would shut down the flow of information.

376
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,168
And I was told by the chief of staff answered me, not the mayor.

377
00:30:30,868 --> 00:30:34,272
And she said, you have to go through the city solicitor and file a FOIA.

378
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:53,154
So I was like, this is- Wait, Mr. President, it was brought to my attention after having a conversation with the elections coordinator that because of the inordinate number of requests that the office was getting relative to the provision of certain documents that they sought advice from the Secretary of State's office as to how to handle it.

379
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:57,155
And then the Secretary of State's office said these requests can be handled as Freedom of Information Act requests.

380
00:30:58,155 --> 00:30:59,956
So Mr. President, to continue,

381
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,263
Michelle Tassinari legal counsel for the Secretary of State's office called me back that afternoon around 430.

382
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:09,585
And she was very upset.

383
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:16,029
And she said, I not only called city clerk's office, city hall, she said, I emailed them.

384
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:23,294
And I told them under no circumstances are they to use our office as the authority in shutting down information.

385
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:25,535
She said, I don't know why they're doing it.

386
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:26,856
It's extremely unusual.

387
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:29,978
She said, but in order for you to get information, you'll have to file.

388
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:35,537
The next day was Veterans Day, the office was closed.

389
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:42,080
I went Friday and filed eight or nine requests for the information that is normally given to us.

390
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:50,805
So the questions I'd like to know is, you people hire and fire the city clerk, did you give the order to shut down the information?

391
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:50,865
No.

392
00:31:56,107 --> 00:32:00,950
So, but the most important question now is,

393
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:06,318
What is the background on the 12,546 names?

394
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:11,782
Did you have that information before either the preliminary or the election?

395
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:16,025
That there was this list that went from active to inactive to active?

396
00:32:16,065 --> 00:32:19,287
Did you- I can't speak for the council.

397
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:22,369
The Memphis City Council doesn't perform election oversight duties.

398
00:32:22,449 --> 00:32:25,971
That's what the board of registrars vote as far as, and that's what the secretary of state's office as well.

399
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:27,252
Well, through the chair,

400
00:32:29,137 --> 00:32:55,533
Secretary, Michelle Tosineri said that, that is something that was, so it was a major mistake, but it was a major mistake that should have been brought to the attention of the administration in the city, both council president and the mayor, because it was, it meant that nobody had to go to a voting, to the precincts and show

401
00:32:56,922 --> 00:33:04,170
a license and or sign an affirmation that they lived where they say they lived and they had lived there January 1.

402
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:16,023
And so did any of you, Councilor Behrs, Councilor Knight, the Councilors over here, did you people know that there was this information of 12,546 names out there?

403
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:31,588
quite frankly, I don't pay much attention to the functions of the office that falls under the purview of the administration that has a department head and a board that's required to make sure that they're in compliance with what's going on.

404
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:32,928
It's the city clerk's office.

405
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:34,889
It's also the board of registrars of voters.

406
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,970
Yes, but the city clerk is the city clerk that was the one that was told.

407
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:42,311
Are you insinuating that the city clerk is conducting some sort of bad behavior or something like that?

408
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:45,952
Because if that's the case, we're really going down a slippery slope here.

409
00:33:45,992 --> 00:33:47,212
I'm not suggesting any of that.

410
00:33:47,252 --> 00:33:48,153
I'm asking questions.

411
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,173
I have questions to ask.

412
00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:58,782
So what Michelle Tosineri, legal counsel, she said these questions should be answered by city hall.

413
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:02,824
Now, I said the city council hires and fires the city clerk's office.

414
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:16,730
I don't know what the city clerk knew or didn't know, but she did tell me that he, she had him put the list back, the active that he put on inactive, she had him put it back to active because it was within a timeframe.

415
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,966
And she said a citizen had called in to complain to the Secretary of State's office.

416
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:25,012
And my question to her as well how would anyone know to even call in.

417
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:32,753
And to do that, like in the different campaigns that people were out there, they didn't have this list.

418
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:42,341
And if you knew the list existed or the information existed, it would be something that you would wanna get just like the way you go in and get the voter activity list from September 2nd.

419
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:50,788
All right, well, I just have the questions I'd like answered is who gave the authority in city hall and under what authority did they have to shut down the information?

420
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:55,292
And then the other thing is- I don't think anybody in this room has that answer.

421
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,118
And I just want to be clear.

422
00:34:58,318 --> 00:35:02,780
So you did say that the Secretary of State's office did say to put these inactive voters back onto the active voters.

423
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,260
Yes.

424
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:15,443
And then, but, but I don't so as of today we still, I do know that one person who requested the information did get was sent had the list.

425
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:18,073
I have not been sent the list.

426
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:22,856
And now I know that city clerk's office, they have COVID and maybe they're all out sick with it and they can't do that.

427
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:23,816
Maybe that's the answer.

428
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:29,059
But it is very discouraging to know that anything that you normally would get, you cannot get right now.

429
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,120
Thank you.

430
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,961
The city clerk's office isn't the keeper of the records.

431
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:34,142
The city solicitor's office is the keeper of the records.

432
00:35:34,162 --> 00:35:36,424
So the provision of the records would come out of the legal office.

433
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:44,749
Well, through the chair, never ever has it been known that anyone goes to the city solicitor's office to ask for the active voting list of any election.

434
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:49,037
for the registered voters, you go to the city clerk's office.

435
00:35:49,798 --> 00:35:50,299
Thank you.

436
00:35:51,521 --> 00:36:02,354
I just think, since we are talking about what the Secretary of State's office said there have been multiple Republic reports in the Medford transcript about this.

437
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:13,853
And I just want to remind everyone that A, the election has been certified, and B, directly quoting Deborah O'Malley, a spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's office, quote, no voter did anything wrong by casting a ballot.

438
00:36:13,953 --> 00:36:15,573
Everybody who voted, voted legally.

439
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,674
That's the opinion of the Secretary of State's office.

440
00:36:23,435 --> 00:36:29,417
Michelle was kind enough on the 10th to let me know that the deadline for

441
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:39,415
Any campaign that I may be volunteering for, the recall deadline to file the papers was Friday the 12th.

442
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:51,263
But she said, don't forget there's section, Mass General Law 54, section 134, which is once an election is certified, you can contest it for 30 days.

443
00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:54,325
So it isn't as though everything's hunky-dory.

444
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:55,066
We don't know that.

445
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:58,348
There's just a lot of questions and we don't have the answers.

446
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:08,041
Gentlemen from East Medford, name and address of the record, please.

447
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:09,822
Thank you, Mr. President.

448
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:18,728
First of all, Andrew Castaneri, Cushman Street, East Ford Mass.

449
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:33,039
First of all, if I recollect correctly, your city councilors on numerous occasions have asked the administration for financial help to the city clerk's office because of all the responsibilities, including the voting

450
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:35,244
Am I correct with that?

451
00:37:35,624 --> 00:37:36,665
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

452
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:37,605
Thank you.

453
00:37:38,486 --> 00:37:52,014
I hope enough went to, the request was honored and heeded and enough of it went through to really help out in the situation of a city of 57,000 peoples.

454
00:37:56,297 --> 00:38:01,200
We must have honest and fair elections without questions.

455
00:38:03,923 --> 00:38:07,446
anywhere in this country, especially in our hometown.

456
00:38:09,407 --> 00:38:19,754
And with 25% of the voters in question, 25% of the registered voters, actually it's more if it's 12.5,000.

457
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:23,217
That's a huge number.

458
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,422
I remember in the days we used to play poker.

459
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:39,905
And if a car got flipped over or an extra car was dealt, we used to call it a flood deal.

460
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:57,137
So I'm thinking, whether this election is certified or can you uncertify it, that we should call this a flood deal and do a do-over election for the sake of many candidates who spent lots of money.

461
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,099
And some of it might be theirs, mind you.

462
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:04,084
Who knows how much time and aggravation?

463
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:15,212
Is it too much to ask in a so-called republic democracy for free, fair elections that we can make book on?

464
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:16,734
That's all I have to say.

465
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:20,076
Do you have any responses at all?

466
00:39:20,637 --> 00:39:20,957
Anyone?

467
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:25,020
We don't have the authority to recall an election that's been certified by the Secretary of State's office.

468
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:28,343
Could we file lawsuits?

469
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:30,632
No, not me.

470
00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:34,694
I ain't got your kind of cash or union money behind me.

471
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:38,736
I'm talking about, a lawsuit can be filed for that, you think?

472
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:40,277
Anything can be done.

473
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:44,258
That is your honorable opinion.

474
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:45,039
Thank you.

475
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:45,639
Thank you, sir.

476
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,661
This is very upsetting in plain English.

477
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:51,121
Thank you.

478
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:52,802
Any further questions?

479
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,766
On the motion by Councilor Mox, as amended by Councilor Mox, to have a committee at the whole meeting as soon as possible.

480
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,550
Seconded by Vice President Knight.

481
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:07,732
All those in favor?

482
00:40:08,212 --> 00:40:08,313
Aye.

483
00:40:08,593 --> 00:40:09,474
Motion passes.

484
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:19,163
2-1, 6-2-1, offered by Councilor Mox, being so resolved that Director of Public Works, Brian Kevins, be recognized for his many years of dedicated service to the citizens of Mifflin.

485
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:19,684
Councilor Mox.

486
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:22,079
Thank you, Mr. President.

487
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:32,246
Recently, we lost a very good city employee, longtime DPW Director Brian Kearns, resigned from his position.

488
00:40:33,207 --> 00:40:37,070
Mr. President, if anyone knew Brian,

489
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,912
knew he was a dedicated worker in this community.

490
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:44,555
He was dedicated to doing his job.

491
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:53,220
He was relentless when it came to supporting his fellow DPW workers, Mr. President.

492
00:40:54,021 --> 00:41:00,465
Brian, in my opinion, probably had the toughest department head position in this city.

493
00:41:01,505 --> 00:41:14,512
From my standpoint, I would probably contact Brian or his office with 90% of the calls that I received, because they dealt with DPW in some fashion.

494
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:18,654
Brian oversaw the pox.

495
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:29,293
highway which included sidewalks and streets, the cemetery workers, water and sewer, forestry, and the list goes on, Mr. President.

496
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:35,076
He really did tremendous work with little funding.

497
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:42,919
And that has been a topic of discussion by this council for a number of years to get more boots on the street.

498
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:56,566
And we've been somewhat successful, but not quite to the level that the residents in this community expect from a full-fledged DPW department.

499
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,567
But it wasn't because of Brian Kerins.

500
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:03,089
It was Brian Kerins that was the glue to this operation.

501
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:05,811
and kept it going for years, Mr President.

502
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:14,361
I think it's sad to see Brian resign right before a major street sweep.

503
00:42:15,172 --> 00:42:18,393
which is kind of a big deal in this city and a big deal with DPW.

504
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:30,536
I think it's sad to see Brian resign right before a winter, which DPW plays an instrumental role in clearing our streets for public safety.

505
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:40,999
I think it's sad to see Mr. President, a department head with so much firsthand knowledge of the inner workings of a community.

506
00:42:41,745 --> 00:42:47,087
And Brian knew every one of the 763 roads in this community.

507
00:42:47,508 --> 00:42:48,808
He knew the infrastructure.

508
00:42:49,128 --> 00:42:50,569
He was familiar with the city.

509
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:53,730
And that's going to be very difficult to replace.

510
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,491
Extremely difficult.

511
00:42:55,931 --> 00:43:02,274
We know firsthand because there are a number of open positions that the city administration is trying to fill now.

512
00:43:02,954 --> 00:43:07,696
And we hear far too often that there's just not the candidates out there.

513
00:43:08,116 --> 00:43:12,658
There's not the knowledge base that would be required in some of these positions.

514
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,600
And the director of DPW is definitely one of those positions, Mr. President.

515
00:43:19,537 --> 00:43:22,439
I just want to thank him for his many years of service.

516
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:33,766
No matter when we had our meetings, Mr. President, whether it was this two Saturday, three Saturdays ago in the pouring rain, Brian Kearns was the first to show up.

517
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,930
He was the first department head, Mr. President, to show up during COVID.

518
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:46,543
I give him a lot of credit for that, Mr. President, because it was voluntary, whether you want to come on Zoom or not.

519
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:54,986
And he was the first department to come up here and provide a little normality for, at least for the residents, and I believe for this council.

520
00:43:55,627 --> 00:43:57,527
So I want to thank him for that, Mr. President.

521
00:43:58,228 --> 00:44:01,669
He was always outgoing, someone that would tell you a good story.

522
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:08,092
And really, when you gave him things to work on, he got them done.

523
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:10,868
He got them done, Mr. President.

524
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,331
And I want to thank him for all his years of service.

525
00:44:15,593 --> 00:44:21,358
I know he doesn't live in the community, but I hope that this is not a loss that we hear from Mr. Kearns.

526
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:26,483
And it would have been great to have some type of transition.

527
00:44:26,503 --> 00:44:35,591
You know, when you have someone that's in a role of that importance, it's nice to hand it off to someone else, Mr. President.

528
00:44:36,598 --> 00:44:43,784
And I don't know if you can fill those shoes and how long will it take and how long will it take to bring someone up to snuff?

529
00:44:44,824 --> 00:44:48,367
You know, I just think it's a big loss for this community.

530
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:52,910
And I wish that it didn't work out this way.

531
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,952
I wish Brian was still on with us.

532
00:44:56,053 --> 00:44:59,675
However, that wasn't my decision, but I want to thank him for his years of service.

533
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:00,536
Thank you, Mr. President.

534
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:05,455
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Marks, for putting this on the agenda.

535
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,297
I agree with everything you said.

536
00:45:07,357 --> 00:45:09,978
I think Brian has done some incredible work.

537
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:28,492
And, you know, my first term, this term, I have been the chair of the Public Works Subcommittee, and I have been lucky enough to work with Brian, Council President, Councilor Marks, Councilor Carviello, through looking at snow removal, snow removal policy, sidewalks, ordinance, et cetera, and Brian was,

538
00:45:29,192 --> 00:45:31,153
was an essential part of that and a great partner.

539
00:45:31,694 --> 00:45:41,359
I can still remember sitting down getting ready to chair my first subcommittee meeting as a counselor and getting some words of encouragement from Brian that it'll be okay.

540
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,000
So it worked out well.

541
00:45:44,061 --> 00:45:48,363
Sad to see him go, but definitely want to congratulate him for everything he's done for our city.

542
00:45:48,604 --> 00:45:48,944
Thank you.

543
00:45:49,784 --> 00:45:50,485
Thank you.

544
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:51,905
Thank you, Mr. President.

545
00:45:51,946 --> 00:45:54,367
Yeah, I echo my colleagues and their kind words on

546
00:45:55,305 --> 00:46:01,107
Mr. Cairns, and before I started my term, I reached out to the majority of the department heads to learn about their departments.

547
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:11,409
And he took time out of his day to take me around the DPW yard, the facility, and show me every single, really every single inch of it and all the work they do down there and all the work he managed.

548
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:21,832
He's always incredibly responsive and just a pleasure to engage with, again, when most of us spend, or all of us spend a lot of our time asking things of him.

549
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:27,539
And he was always very kind and responsive, and he will be missing I think and for as many years of service to the city.

550
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,101
Thank you, Council Falco.

551
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:30,358
Thank you, Mr. President.

552
00:46:30,398 --> 00:46:35,222
I also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and thank Brian for his many years of service to the community.

553
00:46:36,182 --> 00:46:39,845
He was always there, always very passionate about what he did.

554
00:46:40,585 --> 00:46:47,951
And I think probably Councilor Marks had one of the toughest departments, I think, to manage because it just involves so much.

555
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:52,173
I mean, the infrastructure, the budget, I mean, it's just, there's a lot there.

556
00:46:52,193 --> 00:46:57,257
There's a lot to know, and it's a really, really tough position to replace in a city of our size.

557
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,624
And, you know, he's always been very helpful.

558
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:10,053
Same thing when I was first elected I he took me down the DPW yard kind of introduced me to everybody just walked me through the process how things work day to day.

559
00:47:10,073 --> 00:47:12,236
That's very helpful, especially when you knew and

560
00:47:14,772 --> 00:47:15,413
He was always there.

561
00:47:15,553 --> 00:47:21,517
And I think, you know, the thing that I loved about Brian was he's one of those guys you asked him the time and told you how to watch for it.

562
00:47:22,618 --> 00:47:29,263
And that was always helpful during the budget because you'd ask budget questions and he would give you all kinds of information that you didn't even ask for.

563
00:47:29,943 --> 00:47:34,046
But it led to more questions, which was very beneficial, I think, for the council as a whole.

564
00:47:34,747 --> 00:47:36,088
And he will be missed.

565
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:41,031
He was always great to talk to, ask questions to, very valuable.

566
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:42,938
He will be missed.

567
00:47:42,998 --> 00:47:46,640
I just want to thank him for his years of service to Council Marks, and thank you for bringing that forward.

568
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,320
Thank you.

569
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,280
Vice President Knight.

570
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,681
Yes, Mr. President.

571
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:55,302
When I think of Brian Kerins, I first got the chance to meet him when he was with the then MDC.

572
00:47:56,083 --> 00:48:04,045
And then he had a brief stint here in the city of Medford, where he worked with Paul Gere, someone who he couldn't have been more different than.

573
00:48:04,685 --> 00:48:08,607
And when Brian came back, you'd see Brian with dirty boots,

574
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:12,508
yellow reflective vest on walkie talkie always in his hand.

575
00:48:12,948 --> 00:48:17,169
He wasn't afraid to go out in the field to get in the hole, to be out there and working with his people.

576
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:18,950
He did a great job.

577
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,190
Someone that's going to be sadly missed.

578
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:27,212
I do think I brought a wealth of knowledge to our community in terms of the operations of how public works is supposed to be done.

579
00:48:27,892 --> 00:48:30,273
And he's over the years gained

580
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,393
a great deal of institutional knowledge that we're never going to be able to replace.

581
00:48:34,413 --> 00:48:37,815
And we're seeing that more and more with these department heads that are leaving.

582
00:48:38,396 --> 00:48:41,038
You know, we're losing a lot of institutional knowledge here in the community.

583
00:48:41,098 --> 00:48:43,840
And, you know, that's leading to certain situations.

584
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:52,227
But it's my hope that we move forward and we find a replacement for Brian that will be able to fill the big shoes that he's left behind.

585
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:55,690
And I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

586
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,632
So with that being said, Mr. President, I second the council's motion.

587
00:48:59,693 --> 00:49:00,033
Thank you.

588
00:49:00,093 --> 00:49:09,843
And if I could say, you know, Brian, I'll use Councilor Marks' words, did yeoman's work for the city of Medford.

589
00:49:10,684 --> 00:49:16,950
I mean, guy was out there Saturdays, Sundays, I mean, snowstorms, I was out there all the time.

590
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:22,095
I'm telling you, I've never called the guy once where he didn't respond to me immediately.

591
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,937
I mean, his knowledge and

592
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:33,914
And, but the one thing I did know that the respect that the other men from the DBW had for him was outstanding.

593
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,596
The whole department respected him.

594
00:49:35,997 --> 00:49:40,143
I didn't hear anybody on the DBW ever have a bad word to say about Brian.

595
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:50,330
Ryan was, he cared about his man, but you know, I think he was more of a fireman than a DBW, because all he did all day long was put out fires throughout the city.

596
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,452
Got a hole here, a thing there.

597
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:55,274
Talk about using smoke and mirrors.

598
00:49:56,154 --> 00:49:57,315
Ryan was the master of it.

599
00:49:57,355 --> 00:49:59,637
So again, he's gonna be missing this community.

600
00:49:59,657 --> 00:50:02,159
And the guy I do feel bad for was Tim.

601
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:09,204
You know, Tim McGiven's got already a daunting task on his desk, and now he's the,

602
00:50:10,126 --> 00:50:11,267
doing DPW work.

603
00:50:11,647 --> 00:50:22,151
I would hope that the administration finds somebody very quickly before the winter time comes because, again, DPW is... They're right up there with the police and the fire department.

604
00:50:22,592 --> 00:50:24,212
They're the first responders.

605
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:25,753
Thank you.

606
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:26,433
Thank you, Brian.

607
00:50:30,355 --> 00:50:32,396
Richard Orlando, 13 Winford Way.

608
00:50:34,176 --> 00:50:35,176
I'm a little bit puzzled.

609
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:37,737
I've just listened to seven city councilors.

610
00:50:38,097 --> 00:50:44,359
It was almost like you were talking about a person to give a promotion to, an advancement to.

611
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:47,460
Has anybody asked the obvious question?

612
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,301
Why did he leave?

613
00:50:50,341 --> 00:50:54,062
I've been in management positions many times over the years of my career.

614
00:50:54,642 --> 00:51:03,285
If someone leaves, particularly if they're a valuable employee, I wanna know why, because that might mean something I need to correct within my organization.

615
00:51:04,192 --> 00:51:08,254
So there's a question on the table, but I haven't heard any one of you ask.

616
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:09,055
Thank you.

617
00:51:10,035 --> 00:51:10,396
Thank you.

618
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:21,242
So on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor.

619
00:51:21,362 --> 00:51:27,125
Mr. President, before you call the roll, just to, if we can send Brian a citation.

620
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:27,585
Yes.

621
00:51:29,206 --> 00:51:31,467
And to respond to Rick,

622
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:44,159
Rick, Rick, because I think everyone that comes up to the podium ask questions that we can answer or try to answer deserves some type of response.

623
00:51:45,161 --> 00:51:51,669
It's my understanding from the communication that I received from the city administration that Brian was asked to resign.

624
00:51:52,653 --> 00:51:54,434
and he did indeed resign.

625
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:56,115
That's my understanding.

626
00:51:56,795 --> 00:51:57,676
So he stepped down.

627
00:51:58,636 --> 00:52:07,160
So that's how it, I don't know for what purpose he was asked, you know, that I don't know, but that's my understanding.

628
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:09,902
And I stand to be corrected if it's not the case.

629
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:11,122
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

630
00:52:12,123 --> 00:52:12,483
Thank you.

631
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:16,085
So on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor.

632
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,571
Motion passes.

633
00:52:19,591 --> 00:52:37,641
21622 offered by Councilor Morrell, whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women in the United States and in Massachusetts 2021, accounting for more deaths than colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer combined, whereas according to the Massachusetts Centers for Disease Control, there were 5,500 deaths.

634
00:52:39,445 --> 00:52:45,507
50 new lung cancer cases and 2770 deaths caused by lung cancer in 2021.

635
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:56,450
And whereas the five year survival rate for localized lung cancer is minus 59%, yet only 17% of lung cancers are diagnosed at this stage.

636
00:52:56,531 --> 00:53:00,572
And whereas funding for lung cancer cancer trails far behind

637
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:17,970
funding for research of many other cancers and additional research is needed early diagnosis screening and treatment for lung cancer, as well as lung cancer affecting women in lung cancer health disparities ends, whereas African Americans have the highest lung cancer

638
00:53:18,983 --> 00:53:25,429
Incidents in mortality of all races and disparities and like cancer screening diagnosis treatment in mortality.

639
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:38,261
I will carry characterize among African Americans and other racial minorities and whereas lung cancer, and never smokers is a seven pleasing cause of cancer related deaths in accounts for 17,000 to 26,000 deaths in the US every year, 60 to 70%.

640
00:53:43,225 --> 00:53:51,709
of never smokers diagnosed with lung cancer are women in a proportion of lung cancers diagnosed in never smokers is increasing in the United States.

641
00:53:51,969 --> 00:54:05,515
Therefore, be it so resolved that the Memphis City Council recognize November 2021 as Lung Cancer Awareness Month in Medford and encourages all citizens to learn about lung cancer and early detection through lung cancer screening.

642
00:54:05,555 --> 00:54:05,975
Council Member Rao.

643
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,785
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for reading through all of that.

644
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:14,168
So students from the BU chapter of the American Lung Cancer Screening Initiative reached out about this.

645
00:54:14,228 --> 00:54:28,537
They're going around to city councils, town councils around the area to really raise awareness for this leading cause of cancer death that, as you just read, doesn't receive the funding or the recognition that other cancers like breast cancer and prostate cancer receive.

646
00:54:28,577 --> 00:54:32,460
And really just having this on the agenda to raise awareness for early screenings

647
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:40,986
I, you know, personally in my family, I have a very young person who was diagnosed with cancer, stage four cancer that metastasized to her lungs.

648
00:54:41,747 --> 00:54:43,648
And she's still with us, thankfully.

649
00:54:44,129 --> 00:54:52,976
But early screening of all types of cancer, early screening would have done a world of difference for her, her prognosis and the treatment she's received.

650
00:54:53,036 --> 00:55:01,062
So any opportunity to raise awareness about screening opportunities or just talking to your doctor about potential screenings, I think is important, especially as

651
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:17,211
There are such high rates of diagnosis and death and particularly as people have been putting off understandably so medical care because of the COVID-19 pandemic, just encouraging people to have these conversations and see what type of early screenings are out there.

652
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:18,492
So I move approval.

653
00:55:18,872 --> 00:55:19,172
Thank you.

654
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:19,492
Thank you.

655
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:20,693
That's the best.

656
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:21,633
Thank you, Mr. President.

657
00:55:21,673 --> 00:55:23,855
Thank you, Councillor for morale for putting this forward.

658
00:55:24,255 --> 00:55:26,136
I had my grandmother was lucky enough to

659
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:27,828
have her life saved.

660
00:55:27,888 --> 00:55:31,750
She had five different kinds of cancer in her life, but I think lung cancer was the third one.

661
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,911
And luckily an early screening saved her life.

662
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:36,452
And that was many years ago when outcomes were not nearly as good.

663
00:55:37,132 --> 00:55:38,653
So I really appreciate putting this forward.

664
00:55:39,193 --> 00:55:44,875
And I just wanted to note on the fourth paragraph, it says, whereas funding for lung cancer research.

665
00:55:45,396 --> 00:55:45,876
Oh, nevermind.

666
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:46,936
You got it right.

667
00:55:47,276 --> 00:55:47,917
I was reading it wrong.

668
00:55:48,097 --> 00:55:48,437
Thank you.

669
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:49,377
Thank you.

670
00:55:50,258 --> 00:55:52,158
And myself, thanks to Council Member Obama.

671
00:55:52,379 --> 00:55:55,340
My mother suffered from both breast cancer and lung cancer.

672
00:55:56,504 --> 00:56:03,109
Unfortunately, I don't know which one brought her to death first, but thank you for bringing this forward.

673
00:56:03,129 --> 00:56:06,372
It's something I've supported and I support their breast cancer also.

674
00:56:07,252 --> 00:56:08,153
Thank you for bringing this forward.

675
00:56:08,794 --> 00:56:13,017
So on the motion by Councilor Behrs, I'm sorry, by Councilor Morrell, seconded by?

676
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:15,739
Seconded by Councilor Falco, all in favor?

677
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,740
Motion passes.

678
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,601
2-1, 6-2-3.

679
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:23,865
Offered by Councilor Behrs, be it resolved that the City Council

680
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:31,593
that the board of health meet to reconsider the city's mask regulations due to the significant increase in COVID-19 cases.

681
00:56:31,913 --> 00:56:32,513
Councilor Baez.

682
00:56:33,374 --> 00:56:34,355
Thank you, Mr. President.

683
00:56:35,575 --> 00:56:49,723
As we know, the board of health has been meeting monthly, if not more often throughout this pandemic to address the ongoing issues and various different incoming problems that we are facing in terms of public health.

684
00:56:50,604 --> 00:56:53,306
I believe at their last meeting, I don't think there's been a meeting since then,

685
00:56:54,835 --> 00:57:02,982
The Board of Health voted to adjust the city's mask regulations, not in city buildings or public buildings, but in private buildings.

686
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:12,910
And a lot of residents reached out talking about how they felt that the communication around why that happened was unclear and insufficient.

687
00:57:13,522 --> 00:57:27,211
So I know that Board of Health has regular meetings and I'd like them to make sure that this is on the agenda so that they can A, just assess the conditions in the city right now and what they think the regulation should be from a public health perspective.

688
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:34,436
But also I think especially talk about how to explain the decision they're making to the residents of the community.

689
00:57:35,217 --> 00:57:41,085
The day that the decision came out, there was a front page story in the globe saying the cases were rising very quickly.

690
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:49,016
The explanation from the Board of Health said, you know, we're doing this because cases are on the decline but if you looked at the data over the past week the cases have been on the increase.

691
00:57:49,537 --> 00:57:50,418
So I just think that that

692
00:57:51,479 --> 00:58:02,328
kind of clarity of messaging is really important from the Board of Health just to so that residents understand why decisions are being made, what's the health justification, and knowing that they're going to be safe and protected.

693
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:12,537
So really just want them to make sure to have this conversation or ask them to have this conversation at their next meeting and come out of that with a clear message, whichever way they come down on it.

694
00:58:14,098 --> 00:58:16,559
You know, I certainly have an opinion.

695
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:23,623
I'm not a doctor, but I do think that the messaging and the explanation to the community really could stand some review.

696
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:24,383
Thank you.

697
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:25,384
Thank you.

698
00:58:26,565 --> 00:58:27,025
Council Member Max.

699
00:58:28,966 --> 00:58:29,846
Thank you, Mr. President.

700
00:58:29,946 --> 00:58:38,711
I'm just a little confused that the resolution reads that the Board of Health meet to reconsider the city's mask regulations.

701
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:46,446
And now you're saying just to clarify how they got to the point of what they've already done in their last meeting?

702
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:52,749
I mean, it seems like two different... What I mean by reconsider is have it on their agenda and discuss it.

703
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:55,490
If they were to change their decision, that's up to them.

704
00:58:55,810 --> 00:59:00,973
But at the very least, I think we deserve a more accurate and clear explanation of the decision that they made.

705
00:59:01,293 --> 00:59:02,054
Right.

706
00:59:02,174 --> 00:59:04,735
So you're asking them to reconsider mass mandates

707
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:08,632
in local restaurants and businesses throughout the community.

708
00:59:08,953 --> 00:59:11,355
Well, putting it on the agenda would be considering it.

709
00:59:11,455 --> 00:59:12,156
So that's what I mean.

710
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:12,976
Right.

711
00:59:13,197 --> 00:59:13,417
Okay.

712
00:59:13,437 --> 00:59:18,181
I just, I just want to make sure because the language I'm reading is very different than what you just stated.

713
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:21,825
I think it means consider it in a meeting.

714
00:59:22,205 --> 00:59:27,831
You know, they, they made a decision last week, reconsider it this week or whatever this month, last month, this month.

715
00:59:28,894 --> 00:59:29,875
That's all I'm intending here.

716
00:59:30,336 --> 00:59:30,536
Okay.

717
00:59:30,756 --> 00:59:31,837
We don't have any authority over this.

718
00:59:31,857 --> 00:59:35,541
So it's really just saying, I mean, I'm just getting a lot of people saying, why did you do this?

719
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:37,023
Are my kids safe?

720
00:59:37,163 --> 00:59:38,805
Am I safe to go to the grocery store?

721
00:59:38,865 --> 00:59:43,910
You know, and I think people deserve a clear understanding of why we're making the decisions that we're making.

722
00:59:44,210 --> 01:00:01,667
I and I think anyone should be held accountable and actually for a period of time we were having a board of health director appear before the Memphis City Council, giving us, if not week weekly updates, you know, bi weekly updates, Mr. President, and that hasn't happened.

723
01:00:02,207 --> 01:00:06,271
Correct me if I'm wrong, maybe in five, six months, seven months.

724
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:12,155
And I haven't heard any outcry from members of this council saying, where are our updates?

725
01:00:13,696 --> 01:00:14,457
What's going on?

726
01:00:15,577 --> 01:00:18,239
In the past, we heard we have to follow the science.

727
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:27,365
They follow the science, and people are still upset because they want to make sure everyone has a mask no matter where they go, Mr. President.

728
01:00:28,005 --> 01:00:33,269
So for a period of time, you need a mask to walk into a restaurant.

729
01:00:34,395 --> 01:00:43,379
I have to have my mask when I walk into Carol's, but as soon as I sit down, I take my mask off and I sit there and I eat for two hours.

730
01:00:44,899 --> 01:00:52,122
Not sure what that science is, but that was the mandate that was out there, Mr. President.

731
01:00:52,702 --> 01:00:59,065
Now I think we're at a situation right now where the board of health deems that a mask is not required in businesses.

732
01:01:01,077 --> 01:01:04,538
And we're hearing that people wanna bring it back again, Mr. President.

733
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:10,120
And if we're gonna follow the science, let's follow it, right?

734
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,700
Let's be consistent.

735
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:17,602
And so I just wanna make sure we're consistent, Mr. President, whatever we do.

736
01:01:19,043 --> 01:01:20,603
City Hall, you still have to wear a mask.

737
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:23,624
I don't know where that science is.

738
01:01:23,944 --> 01:01:25,405
So it's safe for me to go out to eat.

739
01:01:25,845 --> 01:01:27,625
When I come in City Hall, I have to wear a mask.

740
01:01:28,145 --> 01:01:29,646
There's giant auditorium here.

741
01:01:30,712 --> 01:01:33,256
where you could social distance, you have to wear a mask, Mr. President.

742
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:36,040
Makes no sense.

743
01:01:38,424 --> 01:01:38,724
Thank you.

744
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,040
Council Member Rao.

745
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,400
Thank you, Mr. President.

746
01:01:41,701 --> 01:02:01,725
If the councilor would agree, I'd be happy to suggest amending the paper to invite a representative from the Department of Health to just give us an update as we head into the fall, as numbers continue, as numbers, you know, a little bit of a cyclical pattern at this time, just to talk about what we could probably expect from the city as we head into the fall and cases continue to rise.

747
01:02:03,706 --> 01:02:05,206
I'm certainly open to that amendment.

748
01:02:06,266 --> 01:02:07,447
If I may, Mr. President.

749
01:02:09,365 --> 01:02:10,326
You want to make the amendment?

750
01:02:10,646 --> 01:02:10,786
Sure.

751
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:11,266
Yeah.

752
01:02:11,306 --> 01:02:15,709
Make it as an amendment that the board of health director repairs before the next meeting.

753
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:23,615
Counselor bears is amending that putting an amendment on that, that the board of health director appeared at the next meeting.

754
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:38,685
And I would just add, Mr. President, that I did reach out to the health department and, um, you know, basically they said at least in public buildings that they are still certain as it pertains to the mayor and the health department that

755
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:46,643
They would like that that regulation to stay in place so there may be disagreement in between in there, you know, I don't know.

756
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:50,529
But all I can say is, you know, I was reading something very interesting today.

757
01:02:52,103 --> 01:02:53,624
when it comes to following the science, right?

758
01:02:54,184 --> 01:03:01,389
It's pretty clear at this point that following the science has cultural and political and economic and social determinants that are affecting that.

759
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:05,092
You know, we are at a case rate in Massachusetts.

760
01:03:05,112 --> 01:03:08,534
It's back near where we were in the surge, you know, last winter.

761
01:03:09,935 --> 01:03:12,457
And if you look at Austria or Germany, right?

762
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:15,459
They're below where we are and they're locking things down.

763
01:03:15,619 --> 01:03:19,621
So clearly there's multiple different policy

764
01:03:20,502 --> 01:03:33,577
outcomes that depend on a lot of factors, but the thing that I was reading that was most interesting to me and I think hopefully as many of us as possible can agree on this, the death rate for vaccinated people, even during the Delta variant.

765
01:03:34,313 --> 01:03:39,757
If you are fully vaccinated, you're under 50, the death rate rounded down to zero, zero per 100,000.

766
01:03:40,437 --> 01:03:44,280
So if anything else, the city is running vaccination clinics.

767
01:03:45,041 --> 01:03:49,684
Children, I believe five to 11 were just added to the ability to get the vaccine.

768
01:03:49,704 --> 01:03:56,188
And it really is protecting people from serious cases of disease in most cases, and certainly from death.

769
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:59,691
And I think that's the most important thing we can think about here.

770
01:04:00,051 --> 01:04:00,351
Thank you.

771
01:04:01,472 --> 01:04:22,179
You know, we have, we have a method employees are three medical professionals on on the medical team to, and along with the board of health director was, I think it's, you know, done a great job during this and getting us through this time and I think she'll she'll she'll make the decision with along with the mayor.

772
01:04:25,636 --> 01:04:29,459
You know, the vaccinations are readily available everywhere.

773
01:04:29,919 --> 01:04:33,862
CVS is doing them, Walgreens is doing them.

774
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:38,225
I think we're at the point now with the people who want to be vaccinated have been vaccinated.

775
01:04:38,686 --> 01:04:44,150
I mean, I've got my booster shot, I've got my flu shot, I've got so many shots, I don't know what works anymore.

776
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:45,511
So.

777
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:47,392
You're here with us, Mr. President.

778
01:04:47,432 --> 01:04:48,853
I'm still here, I'm still sitting here.

779
01:04:49,193 --> 01:04:50,414
But again, you know,

780
01:04:53,308 --> 01:05:06,163
You know, I'll take the guidance of our medical staff, which are very, you know, three competent people, and I'll follow their guidance, and whenever they decide to change it, that's what we'll live by.

781
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:07,424
So, Mr. President, if I could.

782
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:08,645
Council Member Max.

783
01:05:09,126 --> 01:05:14,552
So I think we have to be mindful, right, that for the past almost two years,

784
01:05:15,401 --> 01:05:19,903
every business in this community has followed the rules and regulations.

785
01:05:20,603 --> 01:05:26,085
No matter how difficult it may have been for that establishment, they've followed the rules and regulations.

786
01:05:27,165 --> 01:05:36,028
Now the Board of Health is stating that it's all right to go into a restaurant without a mask on, according to their recommendations, Mr. President.

787
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:38,029
It's very different than City Hall.

788
01:05:38,929 --> 01:05:42,370
You know, City Hall doesn't even have to open the door.

789
01:05:42,931 --> 01:05:43,311
You know why?

790
01:05:44,453 --> 01:05:46,134
The money comes in through taxes.

791
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:48,175
They don't have to worry about opening the door.

792
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:56,219
It's the local businesses that have to turn the key, get employees to come in and provide a service.

793
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:07,626
And I think the more that we make it difficult for businesses to operate, Mr. President, it makes it increasingly difficult for people to make a living.

794
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:09,587
We're going on almost two years now.

795
01:06:10,755 --> 01:06:18,323
So in my opinion, I'm not gonna support this tonight, because I'm not gonna revisit anything that goes against the Board of Health's recommendation.

796
01:06:18,704 --> 01:06:20,306
They came up with their recommendation.

797
01:06:20,706 --> 01:06:27,233
Now, there are people in this community that feel that that's not the right recommendation, then don't go out, Mr. President.

798
01:06:28,054 --> 01:06:28,814
Don't go out.

799
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:30,495
It may sound insensitive.

800
01:06:30,855 --> 01:06:31,415
Don't go out.

801
01:06:31,735 --> 01:06:33,076
I had my two injections.

802
01:06:33,496 --> 01:06:34,456
I had my two shots.

803
01:06:34,677 --> 01:06:35,577
My whole family did.

804
01:06:36,137 --> 01:06:39,178
And months later, we all were stricken with COVID, Mr. President.

805
01:06:39,398 --> 01:06:41,159
And it wasn't because I didn't wear a mask.

806
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,440
And it wasn't because I didn't take the precautions.

807
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,781
It's because we really don't know about this virus.

808
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:48,662
We really don't know, Mr. President.

809
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:54,424
And I think it's unfair to subject businesses, local mom-and-pop businesses.

810
01:06:54,704 --> 01:06:58,626
We're not talking about Target or some of the big franchises.

811
01:06:58,846 --> 01:07:01,187
We're talking about local mom-and-pop businesses.

812
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:10,711
And I think to send a message out that we want to go backwards again, Mr. President, and to question the Board of Health, I think is a misstep.

813
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:12,292
I really do, Mr. President.

814
01:07:13,712 --> 01:07:19,196
And so I won't be supporting this Mr. President tonight, because I think we're following the science right now.

815
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:29,945
And I think the science tells us that, you know, they saw something on the news the other night that 95% of the beds in Massachusetts are occupied in our hospitals.

816
01:07:30,685 --> 01:07:37,811
But I think the number, don't quote me on this, but I think 17% of the beds out of the 95% were COVID related.

817
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:47,058
Everything else was people catching up from surgeries they postponed or things that, ailments that they had that they weren't going to the hospital for.

818
01:07:47,378 --> 01:07:50,020
And that's what's driving the numbers in the hospital now.

819
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:53,463
So, you know, I just think we have to

820
01:07:53,963 --> 01:07:55,864
you know, move on the best we can.

821
01:07:55,884 --> 01:08:05,446
And I think this would send a terrible message to our businesses, hundreds of businesses in the community, that we want to take a step backwards, Mr. President.

822
01:08:05,806 --> 01:08:07,726
And in my opinion, there's no need to at this point.

823
01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:08,306
Thank you.

824
01:08:08,527 --> 01:08:08,787
Thank you.

825
01:08:08,827 --> 01:08:14,388
And I, being one of those small businesses, certainly felt the crunch of this.

826
01:08:17,821 --> 01:08:19,182
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

827
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:26,184
Good evening, Mario Carroll 31 Richard Street, and also I'm here as the president of the Metric Chamber of Commerce.

828
01:08:28,525 --> 01:08:39,630
What prompted us to get here and we saw Council of beers is resolution tonight was a little bit upsetting to us we put, we pulled the board of directors and.

829
01:08:41,405 --> 01:08:50,848
Everyone came back saying we should go down there and try to get this ironed out and try to hear exactly what this resolution is looking for.

830
01:08:52,008 --> 01:09:00,030
From what I heard tonight compared to what I read, I'm with Councilor Marks as it sounds different than what we read.

831
01:09:01,731 --> 01:09:10,173
All along through this whole pandemic, the Board of Health hasn't been questioned for any of the moves that they've made.

832
01:09:11,071 --> 01:09:16,458
that the city has been commended overall for the, the way they handled it.

833
01:09:16,938 --> 01:09:23,326
And I'll go back to saying with the doctors that are on the Board of Health and in Mary Ann director.

834
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:28,732
So, I mean, it strikes me a little strange right now that why are we looking to do this?

835
01:09:29,715 --> 01:09:47,964
You know, from what I understand, and I'm not a doctor or a scientist, but science says that the reason the spike is in all the numbers is because they're testing the younger generation, almost the school age, twice, twice as much as they were tested before, which is causing a larger number of

836
01:09:51,982 --> 01:09:56,847
positive, yeah, thank you, thank you, Adam, positive results.

837
01:09:57,428 --> 01:10:03,795
So I mean, I just, I don't understand this time, neither does the chamber, you know, we're trying to bring business back, we're trying to work hard together.

838
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:09,641
There have been so many small businesses in this community that have been hurt, may never even come back.

839
01:10:10,322 --> 01:10:22,792
You know, and they've put their whole life savings and family investments and whatever they could do to keep their doors open and to even think about it in a time like this to say, you know, maybe it's time to look back.

840
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:27,496
It's certainly to me in the chamber's position that this is a board of health matter.

841
01:10:27,716 --> 01:10:29,677
This really isn't a city council matter.

842
01:10:30,098 --> 01:10:30,398
Thank you.

843
01:10:30,638 --> 01:10:30,978
Thank you.

844
01:10:35,122 --> 01:10:35,962
Any further discussion on that?

845
01:10:39,345 --> 01:10:42,168
On the motion by Councilor Baez, seconded by.

846
01:10:43,389 --> 01:10:52,097
Can we just repeat it back, Mr. President, as to what it is we're looking for, if it's, we're looking for an explanation or we are looking for, you know, a review.

847
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:54,539
It was the amendment, that's why I asked.

848
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:04,508
Be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the Board of Health meet to reconsider the city's mask regulations due to

849
01:11:05,645 --> 01:11:16,393
significant increase in COVID-19 cases, as amended by Councilor Beers, to request that the Board of Health Director appear at next week's meeting.

850
01:11:17,553 --> 01:11:18,674
Is that correct?

851
01:11:19,095 --> 01:11:19,255
Yeah.

852
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,636
Okay.

853
01:11:21,496 --> 01:11:21,636
Sorry?

854
01:11:21,656 --> 01:11:22,557
It was the closing amendment.

855
01:11:22,837 --> 01:11:23,197
Oh, I'm sorry.

856
01:11:23,338 --> 01:11:25,219
That's Councilor Morelle amended, I'm sorry.

857
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:27,961
Roll call vote, Mr. President.

858
01:11:29,582 --> 01:11:31,643
Councilor Marks has requested a roll call vote.

859
01:11:32,604 --> 01:11:33,745
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

860
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:37,929
21, 6.3.

861
01:11:37,769 --> 01:11:37,929
Yes.

862
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:38,049
Yes.

863
01:11:38,069 --> 01:11:38,129
No.

864
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:38,249
No.

865
01:11:38,289 --> 01:11:38,509
Yes.

866
01:11:38,589 --> 01:11:38,729
No.

867
01:11:38,749 --> 01:11:42,250
So three for the affirmative.

868
01:12:07,387 --> 01:12:34,585
So, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three,

869
01:12:36,878 --> 01:12:37,882
Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

870
01:12:37,902 --> 01:12:39,868
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

871
01:12:40,229 --> 01:12:40,851
All those in favor.

872
01:12:40,932 --> 01:12:43,219
Motion passes.

873
01:12:44,463 --> 01:12:54,451
6-2-1, 6-2-4, offered by President Caravaglio, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council requests the administration extend the yard waste pickup schedule another two weeks.

874
01:12:55,031 --> 01:13:05,119
Joe, I've been getting, I think all of us have been getting calls about people with the yard waste and saying how the trees, the leaves have been falling from trees.

875
01:13:05,759 --> 01:13:09,882
And I think the 29th is the last pickup schedule if we,

876
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:14,149
Yeah, I think 29 is the last week.

877
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:21,724
And I'm requesting that the administration reach out to waste management so we can get another two extra pickups.

878
01:13:22,265 --> 01:13:23,327
So have some morale.

879
01:13:24,105 --> 01:13:41,733
Thank you, Mr President here I think we're going to continue I thank you for bringing this forward I think we're going to continue to run into issues like this I know earlier in the year we discussed the issue of the buildings that still had heat on in June as climate change makes its impacts we're going to have you know our season shift little bit so this year and going forward it would be great if we could discuss, you know, continue to

880
01:13:42,593 --> 01:13:43,253
Yeah, please check up.

881
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:52,876
I of course am of the mind that pollinators and other friendly critters love your leaves on the in your grass so you can leave them up for those of those who choose to rate them or leaf blow them.

882
01:13:52,896 --> 01:13:56,016
Of course, they deserve to have been picked up.

883
01:13:56,137 --> 01:13:57,297
So thank you for bringing this forward.

884
01:13:57,477 --> 01:13:58,237
Thank you.

885
01:13:58,557 --> 01:14:03,158
Just as someone who raked a lot this weekend, I was disappointed to see how many leaves there were today.

886
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:04,899
So I think we're gonna need a couple extra weeks.

887
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:05,519
Thanks.

888
01:14:06,006 --> 01:14:07,247
Councilor Falcone.

889
01:14:07,387 --> 01:14:13,331
I myself have been raking a lot recently and I noticed still in my neighborhood, there's still a lot of leaves, still a lot of trees.

890
01:14:14,112 --> 01:14:19,255
And so I think we should at least have another, at least one if not two pickups.

891
01:14:19,295 --> 01:14:20,636
So thank you for bringing this forward.

892
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:23,858
This is something that we all encounter year after year.

893
01:14:23,878 --> 01:14:25,519
It needs to go later into the season.

894
01:14:25,559 --> 01:14:28,862
So I would definitely encourage at least one or two more pickups.

895
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:31,744
I think because of all the rain we had this year, the leaves just aren't falling down.

896
01:14:32,884 --> 01:14:33,625
And we can't burn them.

897
01:14:34,987 --> 01:14:37,649
Sorry, we're not allowed to burn them.

898
01:14:37,689 --> 01:14:39,050
Don't be able to burn in your leaves people.

899
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,192
On motion, seconded by.

900
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:42,812
Second.

901
01:14:43,072 --> 01:14:44,313
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

902
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:45,434
All those in favor.

903
01:14:45,634 --> 01:14:45,694
Aye.

904
01:14:45,874 --> 01:14:45,974
Aye.

905
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,015
Motion passes.

906
01:14:47,055 --> 01:14:47,936
Reports of committees.

907
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:54,945
21618, November 16th, 2021, committee of the whole report.

908
01:14:55,005 --> 01:15:01,190
This was in regards to the CPC funding for the fire station.

909
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,793
The motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

910
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:04,733
All those in favor?

911
01:15:06,075 --> 01:15:07,196
Motion passes.

912
01:15:07,856 --> 01:15:10,519
Any further discussion before we do the minutes?

913
01:15:13,501 --> 01:15:16,123
The records of the meeting of November 9th,

914
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,241
2020 were passed to Councilor Falco.

915
01:15:19,261 --> 01:15:21,683
Councilor Falco, how did you find those records?

916
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:25,887
Mr. President, I just received these tonight, so I'll need another week to review these.

917
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:29,309
So if I may ask that these be tabled to the next meeting.

918
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:34,093
And the records of the meeting on November 16th were passed to Vice President Knight.

919
01:15:34,413 --> 01:15:37,996
I too would request the same consideration as offered by Councilor Falco, Mr. President.

920
01:15:38,376 --> 01:15:39,857
So will you both be tabled?

921
01:15:41,378 --> 01:15:42,199
Mr. President, if I may.

922
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:46,409
Just to request that paper 21-543 and I believe it's 21.

923
01:15:46,529 --> 01:15:47,530
I gotta look for it.

924
01:15:55,908 --> 01:16:01,451
21-593, just that those committee of the whole meeting reports be forwarded to the traffic commission.

925
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:01,812
21-593 and 29.

926
01:16:01,852 --> 01:16:02,032
21-543 and 593.

927
01:16:02,112 --> 01:16:02,792
Okay, 21-543 and 29.

928
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:03,993
It's a further request, not a correction.

929
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,045
Okay.

930
01:16:21,165 --> 01:16:23,506
Just that you email them to the Traffic Commission.

931
01:16:23,786 --> 01:16:28,307
Send those two, the minutes of those two to the Traffic Commission.

932
01:16:29,687 --> 01:16:30,007
Okay.

933
01:16:30,247 --> 01:16:32,488
Is that the minutes from the- Cotting Street and Brook Street.

934
01:16:32,508 --> 01:16:33,688
Yeah, the two- Cotting Street and Brook Street.

935
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:35,848
Yeah, the Saturday before the election meeting.

936
01:16:35,969 --> 01:16:39,489
Do we know when the Traffic Commission is meeting again to take up those items?

937
01:16:39,769 --> 01:16:40,790
I don't.

938
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:45,010
I think they meet again in December, if they're meeting in December.

939
01:16:46,091 --> 01:16:47,171
Thank you, Mr. President.

940
01:16:48,927 --> 01:16:54,149
This weekend is, I forget, the football game on Thursday, the annual game.

941
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:55,589
Go Mustangs.

942
01:16:55,609 --> 01:16:59,290
Go Mustangs, get out there and cheer our team on.

943
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:00,991
They're doing quite well this year.

944
01:17:01,031 --> 01:17:03,412
It's the best team we've had in many years.

945
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,692
The game's at Malden.

946
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:07,553
Get out there and support them.

947
01:17:07,653 --> 01:17:09,594
Let's get a winning streak going.

948
01:17:09,614 --> 01:17:10,534
Winning streak going.

949
01:17:11,174 --> 01:17:13,775
This is the start of the giving season.

950
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:18,656
Thanksgiving, Christmas is coming up, people are in need.

951
01:17:21,641 --> 01:17:28,771
I ask everyone in the council, if you want to sponsor a family, or you have a family in need for something,

952
01:17:29,465 --> 01:17:36,888
This is the time where, you know, as counselors, we step up and do over and above what we're supposed to do here.

953
01:17:36,988 --> 01:17:38,068
I can't be sponsored, Ricky.

954
01:17:38,448 --> 01:17:38,769
I'm sorry?

955
01:17:38,869 --> 01:17:39,809
I can't be sponsored.

956
01:17:39,829 --> 01:17:42,810
You can't be sponsored, counselor.

957
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:50,033
Myself and Mike Durham, the last two days, we did over almost 50 families.

958
01:17:51,313 --> 01:17:55,515
And thank you to Dawn Marcelino for helping to provide Mike

959
01:17:56,075 --> 01:17:58,337
with full turkey dinner for everybody.

960
01:17:58,858 --> 01:18:08,827
And again, I say, this is the giving season and I think Christmas is coming up and Thanksgiving, people need food and a lot of things and families are in need.

961
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:11,910
If you want to adopt a family, let me know, I'll help you out.

962
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:16,934
But this is the time for everyone to step up and go over and above.

963
01:18:20,388 --> 01:18:20,968
Mr. President?

964
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:21,168
Yes.

965
01:18:21,768 --> 01:18:25,651
If I could, and I just want to personally thank you, Mr. President.

966
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:32,635
You've been doing this well before you were even on this council, and it doesn't go unrecognized, Mr. President.

967
01:18:32,655 --> 01:18:33,776
Thank you.

968
01:18:33,796 --> 01:18:40,040
Your dedication to assisting those in need in our community, I personally want to thank you.

969
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:40,840
Thank you, thank you.

970
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,122
But again, I'll ask everyone to step up.

971
01:18:43,902 --> 01:18:46,544
There's always families in need, and if you need a family,

972
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:51,787
I'll get your family to help out wherever you need.

973
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:53,668
So, motion to adjourn.

974
01:18:53,788 --> 01:18:54,129
So moved.

975
01:18:55,389 --> 01:18:55,690
Second.

976
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:58,051
Motion by President- Happy Thanksgiving.

977
01:18:58,391 --> 01:18:58,992
Happy Thanksgiving.

978
01:18:59,012 --> 01:19:00,493
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

979
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:02,374
On a motion by Councilor- Thursday.

980
01:19:02,394 --> 01:19:02,834
Thursday.

981
01:19:02,854 --> 01:19:03,414
Thursday.

982
01:19:03,454 --> 01:19:04,975
The football game is Thursday.

983
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:05,996
Thursday.

984
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,217

01:19:09,438 --> 01:19:10,038
All in favor.

987
01:19:10,419 --> 01:19:10,559
Aye.

988
01:19:10,919 --> 01:19:11,539
Motion passes.

989
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:12,120
