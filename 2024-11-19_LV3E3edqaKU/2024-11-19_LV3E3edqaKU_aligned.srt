18
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:23,682
All rise and salute the flag.

19
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:28,443
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

20
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,212
for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

21
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:39,353
Motion by Councilor Scott Kelly.

22
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,753
Suspend the rules.

23
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:47,095
To take paper.

24
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:50,616
Paper 21633 out of order.

25
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:52,497
Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

26
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:53,577
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,200
Yes.

28
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,740
Yes.

29
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,261
Yes.

30
00:00:58,321 --> 00:00:58,741
Yes.

31
00:00:58,961 --> 00:00:59,181
Yes.

32
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:26,603
to President Calvillo and members of Memphis City Council, we respectfully request that your Honorable Body approve the final proposed re-precincting map with legislative districts.

33
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:32,706
The full map of re-precincting is available for view at the City Clerk's Office and online.

34
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:35,857
Good evening, Sandy.

35
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:37,398
A little brief presentation.

36
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:39,439
Good evening, Your Honorable Bobby.

37
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:47,541
The map that's before you tonight is the legislative side of the voting that went on.

38
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:58,565
The legislature passed a bill and was signed into law by Governor Baker that legislative lines had to be honored within the city, and that is the map that is before you tonight.

39
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:07,968
We initially started with six split precincts, and we managed to get it down to two.

40
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:15,171
So we have two sub-precincts, one within Ward 6, and one within Ward 7.

41
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:18,692
Questions for Ms.

42
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:18,892
Gill?

43
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:25,596
I don't know the motion, but that's what it is.

44
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:28,437
Sandy, just so you can explain this.

45
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:37,679
This is mainly because the legislature went out and approved their districts prior to the city, or without considering the city's re-precincting.

46
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:38,660
That is correct.

47
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,401
And that is something that in the history of maps and boundaries being drawn has never happened before.

48
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:52,183
And I did consult with both legislatures, Paul Donato and Sean Garbally,

49
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:56,764
one loses, one gains.

50
00:02:57,025 --> 00:03:07,569
I was unable to get in touch with Christine Barber, but she will gain some down in 7-1-2 as well, I should say.

51
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,050
Thank you.

52
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,730
You're welcome.

53
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,052
Any further questions for Ms.

54
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:13,252
Gell?

55
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,754
So the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Vice President Knight.

56
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:20,475
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

57
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:23,958
Councilor Behrs?

58
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,439
Yes.

59
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:25,720
Councilor Falco?

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,240
Yes.

61
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,481
Vice President Knight?

62
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:27,961
Yes.

63
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:29,042
Councilor Marks?

64
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:29,983
Yes.

65
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:32,204
Councilor Morrell?

66
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:32,624
Yes.

67
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:34,246
Councilor Scarpelli?

68
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:34,566
Yes.

69
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:35,767
President Caraballo?

70
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:36,287
Yes.

71
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:37,208
Seven in the affirmative.

72
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:38,288
Motion passes.

73
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:38,789
Thank you, Sam.

74
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:39,509
Thank you.

75
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,970
Same to you.

76
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:50,765
On the motion by Councilor Falco, it will be referred back to regular business.

77
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,626
Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

78
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:54,487
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

79
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:01,892
Councilor Behrs.

80
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:02,972
Yes.

81
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:04,053
Councilor Falco.

82
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:04,393
Yes.

83
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:05,594
Vice President Knight.

84
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:05,994
Yes.

85
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:06,875
Councilor Marks.

86
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:07,775
Yes.

87
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:09,676
Councilor Morrell.

88
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:10,317
Yes.

89
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:11,417
Councilor Scarpelli.

90
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:11,498
Yes.

91
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:12,658
President Caraballo.

92
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:13,939
Yes, I have an affirmative.

93
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,120
Motion passes.

94
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,127
Hearings, 2-1, 6-2-5 tax hearings.

95
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:28,471
The public hearing will be held by the Memphis City Council and the Harvard Appellate Chambers at Memphis City Hall at 85 George P.S.

96
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:31,373
Drive, Memphis, and via Zoom on Tuesday, December 14th.

97
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:37,737
A link to this meeting, to this hearing, will be posted no later than Friday, December 10th, 2021.

98
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:48,403
The purpose of this hearing is to hear the Board of Assessors on the following items for the allocation of the fiscal year 2022 property tax.

99
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:55,879
to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2022.

100
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,182
Two, to select an open space at discount.

101
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:04,924
Three, select a residential exemption.

102
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,686
Four, select a small commercial exemption.

103
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:14,869
Call 781-393-2501 for any aids and accommodations.

104
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:20,232
So, we open this hearing up.

105
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,350
Good evening.

106
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,151
Good evening.

107
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:27,712
Our name and address of the record, please.

108
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:33,716
Certainly, Ellen Brito, Chief Assessor, City of Medford, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, Mass.

109
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:34,456
Thank you.

110
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:53,147
So this evening, we are, the City Council is requested to set a box policy for the City of Medford by allocating the levy and then making decisions on the other options available to you, which include

111
00:05:55,098 --> 00:06:07,924
from whether or not to adopt an open space, which I don't typically address because we do not have any open space in Medford, so it's not something we need to make a decision on, although you do vote it.

112
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:13,687
And then whether or not to adopt a residential exemption and whether or not to adopt a small commercial exemption.

113
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:17,669
Thank you.

114
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,513
Okay, before we, do we have any questions for Ellen before we get to the classifications?

115
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:37,256
just that for the benefit of the public, we just held a committee of the whole meeting with Alan at 530 this evening and asked many questions and discussed this process.

116
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:41,138
So I did prepare during my homework assignment.

117
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:47,962
I do have that impact of the residential exemption at a 20% or 35% that I was able to do.

118
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,646
If you like, just give a little explanation on it.

119
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:09,367
Certainly.

120
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:14,950
Councillor Marks, I did send one to your email address, so you should be receiving that.

121
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:16,363
There we go.

122
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:25,009
So during the Committee of the Whole meeting, one of the items that I did not include in this year's presentation was the breakdown, and I apologize for that.

123
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:26,950
This year has been very tight on time.

124
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:37,957
I was still working on this packet on Friday, and I would prefer to be meeting with city council before Thanksgiving, so maybe next year we can set that as a target.

125
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:42,560
But with this one item that I did not include in the original packet,

126
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,944
was the breakdown of, and again, these are estimates in a draft.

127
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:52,688
This is not by any means the final, what those numbers would look like.

128
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:55,470
It's my best estimate of what it would appear to be.

129
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:03,416
So we know factually that we have 16,574 residential properties in the city of Bedford.

130
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:12,103
That's what was approved by the commission, the Bureau of Local Accounts and the Division of Local Services for the state.

131
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:22,046
Our total value on residential value, and that correlates back to the classification packet, is over 11 billion.

132
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:38,272
And we know that without a residential exemption, our tax rate, again, estimate $9.02, that could move by pennies depending on what the state finalizes our tax recap with.

133
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:50,947
So with a 20% exemption, the value of that exemption, the $141,073 comes off of somebody's residential assessment.

134
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:59,431
If we voted and they were owner occupied, they would take that amount off of their assessment and that would be what they would pay taxes on.

135
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:03,153
So I'm going down the very first column here using that 20% example.

136
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:10,797
I estimate that over 13,000 qualify to receive that exemption.

137
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:23,447
So you take that, what the exemption is, and you multiply it times the amount to come up with a net taxable residential value after a residential exemption.

138
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:31,254
And that amount is divided into the levy, which is the residential cost levy over 105 million.

139
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:43,050
Therefore, if there was a residential exemption, using these rough estimates here, the rate would not be 902, the rate would be $10.79.

140
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:57,222
So properties that are above the break-even would be paying that higher rate, but properties below the break-even would potentially see a $636 tax savings.

141
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:01,145
Properties that don't qualify for the exemption at all

142
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:10,828
would see an increase in of $887 in taxes along that say again using average break even point average numbers.

143
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:16,071
And that's called I use the 20% and the 35% as examples going through.

144
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:23,973
So the average home right now goes up, you said about $138?

145
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:24,733
That's correct.

146
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:32,136
So it would go up from $100 and change to $887?

147
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,217
For a property that did not qualify for an exemption.

148
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:36,297
For a property that did not qualify.

149
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:36,898
Correct.

150
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:44,200
Right, which is that tax without, with tax savings.

151
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:48,742
For those, and again, I did this very quickly, so.

152
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:55,766
I know assessor's strong point, it's supposed to be math and I use Excel pretty well, but this was done fast.

153
00:10:55,866 --> 00:11:00,989
So I thought I had till 7.30 and my assistant said, oh no, you gotta get back up there.

154
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,690
So here we go.

155
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:10,475
One of the other questions Councilor Behrs had requested was how many seniors under, that would take a little bit more.

156
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:16,478
That I would be picking a number out of the air and that I'm very uncomfortable doing.

157
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:19,100
So we will work on that for you certainly.

158
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,861
just if I made that request was for to talk about next year.

159
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:24,461
Correct.

160
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,142
When you have time.

161
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:25,622
Yeah.

162
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:26,282
Certified.

163
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:33,584
And I I I apologize again like last year we're not not 2021 cuz it's been a horrible year.

164
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:45,108
But the year prior I'm able to do that analysis you know in the spring and send those documents up to city council at that point in time if you wanna meet with me I'm happy to meet with you over it.

165
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,911
And I'm not an advocate either way.

166
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:48,932
That's not my role.

167
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:54,938
My role is just to implement whatever this body decides is the most appropriate that you feel as elected officials with the city.

168
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:57,782
Mr. President.

169
00:11:58,993 --> 00:11:59,553
Council Member Hill.

170
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:00,413
Thank you, Mr. President.

171
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:01,694
Thank you, Ellen, for that.

172
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:13,577
Yeah, I just wanna go on record saying that I'm very much in favor of exploring this and just learning more about how this could impact or benefit or harm in some cases, the community through the tax bills.

173
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:25,680
But based on what we discussed at the last meeting, understanding that it's very late in the year to have these discussions, you would need to really be staffed up in order to process exemptions like this if it were something

174
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,460
that we were to pass.

175
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:34,462
I, you know, I'm really interested in having these conversations, but understanding your advisement that this is something we should do in the spring.

176
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,402
My vote is going to reflect that.

177
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:37,162
So thank you.

178
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:37,803
Thank you.

179
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:40,603
Hey, Councilor Knight.

180
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:41,983
Mr. President, thank you very much.

181
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:43,424
And Ellen, thank you for being here this evening.

182
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:44,404
You always do a great job.

183
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:48,385
So in reading the packet here, and I apologize for not being able to make the meeting earlier.

184
00:12:50,968 --> 00:13:08,383
The breakeven point looks like it's 705,000 give or take so that would be the assessed value of your home at 705,000 would be the breaking point, the breakeven point, which means that if your home was assessed over that amount that you, even though you would be an owner occupied policy wouldn't be eligible to receive.

185
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:18,787
the exemption, because when you receive the exemption but the shift would still come back to you so you'd actually see an increase in your tax bill if your property was assessed over that figure.

186
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:19,768
That's correct.

187
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:24,713
And then based upon your assessments here it looks like there would be about almost 14,000 eligible parcels.

188
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:27,884
That's correct.

189
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:31,168
Those were the numbers that we derived from the assessing database.

190
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:31,569
Okay.

191
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:35,393
And it almost looks like half of those would be above the break even point.

192
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,175
Yeah, that's using averages.

193
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:39,859
And then of that 50% almost a third of that would be

194
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,971
senior citizen population.

195
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:58,958
And that was one of the ones that counselor bears had requested to know we know that we took the voter registration role, but I there's some things that in my mind I need to prove out of that.

196
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,722
We know how many older, and it was over age 60 I apologize I said 65 before so I want to correct that it was over 60.

197
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:08,402
We know they're over 60.

198
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:11,083
And then when you step back, there's so many layers to it.

199
00:14:11,204 --> 00:14:13,144
So yes, we have this many people over 60.

200
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:18,867
Oh, how many are a married couple or a couple still living in the same home?

201
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:31,392
So my numbers get really distorted when you start going down that rabbit hole where, wait a minute, I might not have 6,000 elderly single owner properties.

202
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:32,072
I might have,

203
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:38,228
63,000 couples living in owner occupied property.

204
00:14:38,248 --> 00:14:41,048
So those are the things that have to get all flushed out.

205
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:45,750
And that's why it's not something that I can just flip a switch and say, we've got residential exemption.

206
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,650
I can't.

207
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:47,871
Excellent.

208
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:48,151
Thank you.

209
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:50,912
I appreciate it.

210
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,592
Mr. President.

211
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,413
Thank you, Mr. President.

212
00:14:56,146 --> 00:15:08,792
Ellen, if you could just clarify, out of the 6,500 properties that are above the break-even point, do you have a breakdown on what type of classification those properties are?

213
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:15,215
If I live in a two-family, am I eligible if I own a two-family?

214
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,078
Yes, you are.

215
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:36,779
And when I, when I know those are stats I got it right down on the desk down there where when I took the ancestors database, I knew that it was 97% were single family, then when you go to a condo it was like 80 something percent, you get to a two family now you're starting to have a more of a 70%.

216
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:47,044
So I have that percentage, but again, I feel that I'm not giving a true picture when I'm just taking the assessor's database and saying, where am I?

217
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:52,127
I'm assuming that if you get your mail in Medford and your tax bill in Medford, you live in Medford.

218
00:15:52,707 --> 00:15:54,988
That's a very poor assumption for me to make.

219
00:15:55,328 --> 00:16:05,873
And that's why I feel like it really needs due diligence to go through and make a very more informed opinion on to what that impact is.

220
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:11,505
So just so I understand, how are we counting?

221
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:22,552
If someone has a two family and they live on half the two family and they rent the other side, that rental would not be considered, correct?

222
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:26,854
They would be considered, it's the property.

223
00:16:27,214 --> 00:16:33,538
So if they live in the downstairs unit, the entire property gets the exemption.

224
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:36,160
I don't allocate it by the number of units.

225
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:45,005
And you gotta realize too, many of those two families are multi-generational families that share the home.

226
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:46,745
It's not like they are renting them out.

227
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:50,786
To the flip side, the whole two family gets rented out.

228
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:54,167
So, you know, you have both going on in the city.

229
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,287
But there's no allocation.

230
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:59,448
If they live in one of the units, they get the exemption.

231
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:04,589
Right, and is that state statute or is that just how each community handles it?

232
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:08,638
That's by the way that you do calculate your residential exemption.

233
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:12,499
It's not an option for the city to say.

234
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:21,441
And they're different than my senior exemptions are, or a veteran exemption would be a better example.

235
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:23,821
There's no allocation.

236
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:28,142
A veteran owns a two family, he's 100% disabled, he gets his full exemption.

237
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:32,823
We don't reduce it for that certain types.

238
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:41,737
Right, I'm just trying to figure out what the number that 6,500 is compromised of.

239
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:48,239
The 6,500 of the number that I put on.

240
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:53,280
The breakeven number, the number of properties that are above the breakeven point.

241
00:17:54,081 --> 00:18:00,843
That is compiled of all single family, multifamily condos.

242
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:05,044
So when I take all the parcel counts within that,

243
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:19,712
class, anything in a residential class, which equals the 16,574, 6,500 are over the 705,000 and change a break even point.

244
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:21,313
Right.

245
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:29,074
So someone has a three family, they rent out two of the units, they're still eligible for a residential exemption.

246
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:31,255
They live in, they occupy

247
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:32,349
That property.

248
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:35,371
Even though it becomes a moneymaker, right?

249
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:45,159
I mean, the property is now a moneymaking property and not a residential type situation.

250
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:48,559
That would be correct.

251
00:18:48,579 --> 00:19:05,368
You know, you have so many other layers to it that counselor, you can say that those properties that they're renting are more affordable rent because they aren't paying a higher tax rate, you start charging a higher tax rate on.

252
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:13,013
properties that are non-owner occupied, then the rents go up and then we get into the flip side of not having affordable housing in Medford.

253
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,655
So you got to look at all of that.

254
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:22,419
You can't just look at the one piece and what the impact is if you do one thing where it goes.

255
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:26,202
That's why it's a really, it's a lot.

256
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:28,924
We all know the cost savings would

257
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,519
probably not be passed on to the renters, correct?

258
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:42,153
If someone received a residential exemption, I'm sure they're not gonna lower the rents based on what exemption they're receiving.

259
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:51,542
or they could be correct, or they might provide a better rent to somebody to live in Medford.

260
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:54,804
We would hope that's the case, but I don't think it's the case.

261
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:56,685
I support this.

262
00:19:57,165 --> 00:20:00,267
I support having this reviewed.

263
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,188
I've mentioned in the past

264
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:10,141
that because this affects a number of property owners that currently live in their property, they would pay a higher rate.

265
00:20:11,162 --> 00:20:15,784
That's one reason why in the past I did not support this.

266
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:23,947
But I think at some point we're getting close to a number that may make sense in this community to give people, you said $636 savings.

267
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:34,911
And this economy would go a long way to assisting those people, seniors and people on fixed incomes and so forth.

268
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:46,656
So I think, you know, maybe not this go around, but eventually I think we're going to hit that point where this makes all but sense to support in this community.

269
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:52,939
And if you look at the surrounding communities that probably have a higher rate of, you know,

270
00:20:54,828 --> 00:21:03,651
non-owner occupied, it makes sense for them, like Malden and Cambridge and Chelsea and Everett, it probably makes sense for them.

271
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:07,112
I don't think we're quite at that point quite yet.

272
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:10,553
So that's why I will not be supporting this tonight.

273
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:11,633
Thank you.

274
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:14,914
Thank you, Councilor Watts.

275
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:15,474
Councilor Betz.

276
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,014
Thank you.

277
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:19,615
And this was actually really helpful for me to understand this.

278
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:21,696
Basically, if we were to implement this,

279
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:33,045
anyone who lives in a residential unit and owns that unit, or owns that property would qualify for the residential exemption.

280
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:38,769
The issue is that over a certain value, the increased rate

281
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,211
overtakes the savings from that exemption.

282
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:47,194
So even if your home's worth $2 million, you would still qualify for the residential exemption.

283
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:56,418
It's just that the difference in the rate of $2 per 1,000 would end up being more than the exemption that you're getting on the front end.

284
00:21:57,018 --> 00:22:00,320
So it's not that certain, if you're over 700,000, you wouldn't qualify.

285
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,941
It's just that you wouldn't save anything.

286
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:04,683
and you may end up paying more because the rate is higher.

287
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:15,951
So essentially the policy decision, and obviously I think we're all very clear we're not gonna be making this decision today, not only because it would be a nightmare for your office, but it would be very difficult.

288
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:18,212
It'd be impossible, I think it's fair to say.

289
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:30,241
The policy question in the future would be, do we think that people whose home values are less than 700,000 should pay a little bit less and people whose home values are more than 700,000 should pay more?

290
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:34,633
That's basically the decision at the end of the day.

291
00:22:35,213 --> 00:22:38,335
It's absolutely, within the residential class, that's what happens.

292
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:46,281
And when you look at page six to Councilor Mark's question, that three family is gonna pay more in taxes because the average three family is close to 900,000.

293
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:47,582
Right.

294
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:55,908
Even though they're living in one of the units, they're gonna get an exemption because they qualify, but the rate is pushing their value, their tax bill up.

295
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:59,651
And then they could choose to distribute that exemption, the break.

296
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,132
They could say, we're gonna keep, you know,

297
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:11,433
we're gonna pay this amount of taxes and not that even these decisions really happen this way, but we're gonna pay this amount and the renters are gonna pay this amount and that distribution would be up to the property owner.

298
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:15,794
I mean, they end up paying the city the same thing, but yeah.

299
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:18,495
That's a whole business decision for the rent.

300
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:23,816
Right, all right, that really helped me to fully grasp what this means, so thank you.

301
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:24,736
You're very welcome.

302
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:28,337
Thank you.

303
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:30,418
Any further questions, Rowan?

304
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:40,036
Hearing and seeing none.

305
00:23:40,397 --> 00:23:41,541
So the first question.

306
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:48,836
would be selection of a minimum residential factor.

307
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,357
Motion to adopt the lowest residential factor.

308
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:52,237
I'm sorry?

309
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,357
Motion to adopt the lowest residential factor.

310
00:23:54,737 --> 00:24:09,601
Okay, on the motion by Vice President Haynes to vote for the lowest residential factor, which would be a factor of 9148, yields a split tax rate of 902 for residential, and 1726 for commercial, industrial, and personal property.

311
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,321
Second.

312
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:13,182
Seconded by Councilor Baez.

313
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:16,555
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

314
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:21,438
To accept the 9-1-4-8 yield.

315
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:31,586
Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

316
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:32,587
Here comes the roll call.

317
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:34,148
Councilor Behrs?

318
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:34,928
Yes.

319
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:36,950
Councilor Falco?

320
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:37,470
Yes.

321
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:39,051
Vice President Knight?

322
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:39,371
Yes.

323
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:40,332
Councilor Marks?

324
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:41,073
Yes.

325
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:42,935
Councilor Morrell?

326
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:43,716
Yes.

327
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:44,857
Councilor Scarpelli?

328
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:45,177
Yes.

329
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:46,458
President Kerrio?

330
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:47,079
Yes.

331
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:48,480
Semi-affirmative.

332
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:50,641
Motion passes.

333
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:55,785
Number two, vote on whether to adopt a residential exemption.

334
00:24:57,567 --> 00:25:02,290
Motion?

335
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:05,973
Good evening.

336
00:25:05,993 --> 00:25:07,054
Name and address of the record, sir.

337
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:08,215
Yes.

338
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:11,818
Andrew Castanetti, Cushion Street Method Mass.

339
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:16,402
I want to read some brief points, if I may.

340
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:21,225
This is probably my 19th time here for this matter in December.

341
00:25:22,966 --> 00:25:29,571
My only agenda is to save the majority of owner-occupied homeowners some serious money in their tax bills.

342
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:33,253
By the way, this report is incomplete.

343
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,235
Was it a mistake or was it on purpose?

344
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:54,882
Imagine even the state politicians felt the pain of the unoccupied homeowners and passed a law, Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C in 1998, 23 years ago.

345
00:25:56,403 --> 00:26:02,248
And it was adopted in Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Cambridge, and all of Boston.

346
00:26:03,222 --> 00:26:08,446
Even Senator Kerry gets it at 28 Lewisburg Square on Beacon Hill.

347
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:11,989
If, according to the IRS, that's his legal address.

348
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,634
Unless he's on his yacht, tax-free yacht in Rhode Island, I don't know.

349
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:26,861
There must be a damn good deal for the majority of homeowners because the proof is

350
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:34,858
They're still doing it and they have not dropped out of this wonderful program.

351
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:39,422
So why not here in Medford?

352
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,905
We've been losing out since 1998.

353
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:52,593
If it's adopted, over 80% of the unoccupied homes, homeowners would see savings.

354
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:08,190
And the actual average of savings would be $2,000 per year, every year, and increase in the following years, according to this outrageous inflation.

355
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:12,412
State tax bill, real dollars.

356
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:26,211
Our savings would simply be added to all of the absentee owners' real estate tax bills, meaning the city still gets the whole tax levy wanted.

357
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:41,101
Also, if your home is in a trust, you will also get the exemption slash savings provided the trust is still in the owner's name, period.

358
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:49,609
Also, thus our exemption does not affect the commercial entities at all.

359
00:27:51,570 --> 00:28:09,385
So in the name of fairness and justice, why not we give them, us, this real estate tax decrease to the homeowners who supported and carried our fair city of Medford for many, many, many decades.

360
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:12,426
So why not here, please?

361
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:14,007
It's long overdue.

362
00:28:14,307 --> 00:28:39,875
In closing, I'm asking, requesting all seven of you honorable city councilors, if you are for or against this Mass General Lobb Chapter 59 Section 5C slash owner-occupied real estate tax exemption.

363
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,964
in Medford and why?

364
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:52,386
If anyone wants to answer my questions, I appreciate it.

365
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:53,287
Thank you, sir.

366
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:07,470
Your silence is deafening.

367
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,090
Thank you for listening.

368
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:12,454
Mr. President.

369
00:29:15,957 --> 00:29:17,018
Thank you, Mr. President.

370
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:20,842
And I want to thank Mr. Castanetti.

371
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:29,249
He's been consistent over the past 19 years about bringing this residential exemption forward, Mr. President.

372
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:36,495
And I want to thank him because I think I'll speak just for myself.

373
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:38,037
I won't speak for anyone else behind the real.

374
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:45,334
I think the intention of this particular general law has great merit.

375
00:29:46,494 --> 00:30:00,680
However, in our community at this particular point, due to the breakeven point, it leaves thousands of people that live in owner-occupied property to pay a higher tax.

376
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,068
And I just find that unfair.

377
00:30:04,108 --> 00:30:17,882
And even though it benefits the majority, which Mr. Cassidy is correct, it may benefit the 80% that will receive a property reduction, tax reduction, I am concerned equally

378
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:29,825
about the 20% that live in their property that may be property rich because they bought their home 40 years ago and their assessed value is over the $705,000.

379
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:33,926
However, they're going to pay a higher tax because of that.

380
00:30:38,476 --> 00:30:41,218
You know, so I still have a concern with that.

381
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:50,848
The numbers, if we were talking, you know, a handful of people that were above the threshold, it would make that decision much easier for me.

382
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,492
But when you're talking thousands of people in the community,

383
00:30:55,172 --> 00:31:00,635
that are above the threshold will pay a higher amount, I have a problem with that.

384
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:03,676
And I hope Mr. Cassidy can understand that.

385
00:31:04,277 --> 00:31:12,661
And I'm hoping someday I'll be joining him on the other side of the real advocating for this and pushing for this at the right time.

386
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:16,726
And, you know, so I want to thank him for his advocacy.

387
00:31:17,146 --> 00:31:22,533
Anything that helps seniors and people on fixed incomes, I think is a worthy cause.

388
00:31:23,074 --> 00:31:27,720
And I know this is why Mr. Castaneda has pushed this for many, many years.

389
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:50,519
So I just wanted to thank him, but that is my reasoning, Mr. Castaneda, that I will not be supporting this tonight because it leaves out far too many residents that I think are in the same boat, that deserve some tax relief, and that will only experience a tax increase with this change.

390
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,121
And I'm not willing to do that at this point.

391
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:54,862
But I thank you for your advocacy.

392
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:56,544
Thank you, Councilmember Max.

393
00:31:58,921 --> 00:31:59,301
Please.

394
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:03,343
I want to thank Councilor Marks for using common sense again.

395
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:04,763
I appreciate it.

396
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:08,664
I'm going to try to simplify what this means in net net.

397
00:32:09,865 --> 00:32:13,146
I have like 16,000 residential units.

398
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:20,288
In reality, over 10, 11, 12,000 are going to save.

399
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:24,070
And it's calculated differently.

400
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:26,148
if you don't understand.

401
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:30,310
Yes, the present tax rate proposed is $9.02.

402
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:41,876
And yes, if we go with the full 35% exemption, which I would like, the tax rate would go up.

403
00:32:42,776 --> 00:32:52,481
However, what you do is, even if you live in a three family or a five family house, you will get it, but you get a dollar amount.

404
00:32:53,697 --> 00:33:08,008
In other words, at 35% shift, they take 35% of the value of your house, let's say it's a million, they take off 350, so that leaves 650, and then they calculate that at a higher rate.

405
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:14,153
But in over 85% of the cases, you're saving money.

406
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:21,198
Thank you.

407
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:29,845
All right, number two, we need to vote on whether to adopt a residential exemption.

408
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:30,966
Chair awaits a motion.

409
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:42,937
The motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

410
00:33:42,957 --> 00:33:44,238
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

411
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:46,740
This is to reject the residential exemption.

412
00:33:47,821 --> 00:33:48,322
That is correct.

413
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,370
Councilor Behrs?

414
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:57,991
Yes.

415
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,412
Councilor Falco?

416
00:33:59,572 --> 00:33:59,772
Yes.

417
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:01,113
Vice President Knight?

418
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:01,893
Yes.

419
00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:02,454
Councilor Marks?

420
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:03,354
Yes.

421
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,015
Councilor Morrell?

422
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:05,436
Yes.

423
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:06,736
Councilor Scarpelli?

424
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:06,837
Yes.

425
00:34:07,497 --> 00:34:08,197
President Kerrio?

426
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:08,718
Yes.

427
00:34:08,998 --> 00:34:10,499
Seven in affirmative, motion passes.

428
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:16,703
Number three, vote on whether to adopt a small commercial exemption.

429
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:29,941
The motion by Vice President Nate not to adopt the small commission has been seconded by Councilor Falco.

430
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,002
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

431
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:43,087
Councilor Behrs.

432
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:45,208
Yes.

433
00:34:46,408 --> 00:34:47,009
Councilor Falco.

434
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:48,149
Yes.

435
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:49,670
Vice President Knight.

436
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:50,670
Yes.

437
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:51,771
Councilor Marks.

438
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:52,972
Yes.

439
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:54,933
Councilor Morrell.

440
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:55,413
Yes.

441
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:56,573
Councilor Scarpelli.

442
00:34:56,613 --> 00:34:56,733
Yes.

443
00:34:57,614 --> 00:34:58,414
President Caraballo.

444
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:00,154
Yes, affirmative motion passes.

445
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:05,836
And the last one to select an open space discount.

446
00:35:11,538 --> 00:35:15,279
Motion by Vice President not to adopt that seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

447
00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:16,400
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

448
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:30,625
Councilor Behrs?

449
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:33,267
Councilor Fevella?

450
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:33,707
Yes.

451
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:35,288
Vice President Knight?

452
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:35,748
Yes.

453
00:35:36,028 --> 00:35:36,549
Councilor Marks?

454
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:37,509
Yes.

455
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,150
Councilor Morrell?

456
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:39,590
Yes.

457
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:41,171
Councilor Scarpelli?

458
00:35:41,211 --> 00:35:41,271
Yes.

459
00:35:42,132 --> 00:35:42,792
President Kerbeil?

460
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:44,533
Yes, I move the affirmative.

461
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:45,354
Motion passes.

462
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:46,294
Ellen, thank you very much.

463
00:35:46,314 --> 00:35:49,816
Thank you, Your Honor.

464
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:50,797
Good all day to you.

465
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,340
I think that is it.

466
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,642
Is anything under public participation?

467
00:36:03,888 --> 00:36:08,791
I think I'm the public participation this week.

468
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:10,532
Public participation, may I?

469
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:18,257
Good evening and hope you all have a merry Christmas and happy holidays.

470
00:36:18,418 --> 00:36:19,278
We will see you next week.

471
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,940
I'm not sure if I'm still gonna be around.

472
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,183
And to all else, a happy New Year's.

473
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:27,063
Thank you, Mr. President.

474
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:27,564
Thank you.

475
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:32,607
Okay, anything else before we go to the records?

476
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:39,785
Okay, the table of records of November 30th were passed to Councilor Morrell.

477
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:41,427
Councilor Morrell, how did you find those records?

478
00:36:41,707 --> 00:36:43,328
I found them to be in order and move approval.

479
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:48,531
The motion by Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

480
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:50,572
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

481
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:53,795
Councilor Behrs?

482
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:54,315
Yes.

483
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:55,376
Councilor Falco?

484
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:55,736
Yes.

485
00:36:56,196 --> 00:36:56,836
Vice President Knight?

486
00:36:56,877 --> 00:36:57,137
Yes.

487
00:36:57,357 --> 00:36:57,957
Councilor Marks?

488
00:36:58,357 --> 00:36:58,618
Yes.

489
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:00,359
Councilor Morrell?

490
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:00,759
Yes.

491
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,940
Councilor Scarpelli?

492
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:02,480
Yes.

493
