[SPEAKER_58]: Alicia, can you please introduce any staff at the meeting or on the call?

41
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:21,005
[SPEAKER_41]: Good evening.

42
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:24,847
[SPEAKER_41]: I am Alicia hunt the director of planning development and sustainability.

43
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:40,696
[SPEAKER_41]: We have with us here in the room our graduate intern Christian who is helping us with a lot of the notes and speaking queue and online, we have Juliette Garrity, you'll notice that after her name, it says technical questions here.

44
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:43,678
[SPEAKER_41]: If anybody online has difficulty.

45
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:56,167
[SPEAKER_41]: with unmuting or raising your hand and you just want to chat somebody and ask them for help, you can direct your questions to Juliet and she is there to provide technical assistance online.

46
00:02:56,187 --> 00:03:00,370
[SPEAKER_41]: We don't expect our senior planner this evening.

47
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:18,815
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, so also with us this evening is Tim McGivern, our DPW Commissioner.

48
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:21,456
[SPEAKER_58]: Thanks, Alicia.

49
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:29,135
[SPEAKER_58]: We do have a slight adjustment to the agenda.

50
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:35,596
[SPEAKER_58]: Given the technical difficulties that we had setting up for the Zoom meeting, we are going to be postponing the executive session.

51
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:39,537
[SPEAKER_58]: We'll be working with our legal counsel to file an extension there.

52
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:45,938
[SPEAKER_58]: As we've said in previous meetings, July 9th is, you know, meant for public comment.

53
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:50,459
[SPEAKER_58]: So we want to prioritize public comment, the people that are here tonight and on Zoom.

54
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:55,380
[SPEAKER_58]: So we're going to postpone or reschedule the executive session.

55
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,151
[SPEAKER_58]: specifically because of the technical difficulties.

56
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:05,692
[SPEAKER_58]: Executive session, well, we were supposed to open the meeting at six.

57
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:11,814
[SPEAKER_58]: I don't know how long I've been talking, but maybe we opened at 6.50.

58
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:17,195
[SPEAKER_58]: So we're just being cognizant and considerate of the rest of our agenda.

59
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:19,536
[SPEAKER_58]: So thank you to everybody for your understanding there.

60
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:37,406
[SPEAKER_58]: So in light of that, our next agenda item is going to be continuing our public hearings on the neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts, ADUs, and Medford and West Medford squares.

61
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:55,651
[SPEAKER_58]: So we're opening all three of these hearings at once, and there's no presentation of new information from Innes Associates, as has been said before.

62
00:04:57,173 --> 00:05:09,924
[SPEAKER_58]: Before moving into public comment, the Department of Public Works Commissioner, Tim McGivern, is going to be answering board questions regarding how the zoning might affect essential services like water, sewer, and so on.

63
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:15,868
[SPEAKER_58]: I just want to recognize that we're doing this based on public feedback.

64
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:17,789
[SPEAKER_58]: We're doing this based on board input.

65
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,670
[SPEAKER_58]: We're trying to be as responsive as possible.

66
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:27,355
[SPEAKER_58]: So that's why we have somebody from city staff coming and speaking with us tonight and asking, answering board questions.

67
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,000
[SPEAKER_58]: After that, we're going to move into public comment period.

68
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:44,968
[SPEAKER_58]: We may take a short recess, but we are definitely gonna reassess kind of the current status in terms of in-person comments, virtual comments around 10 p.m.

69
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:46,912
[SPEAKER_58]: Um.

70
00:05:48,093 --> 00:06:01,825
[SPEAKER_58]: If we still have a lot of public comments if we still have a lot of online comments, we may continue to a date certain our goal is to gather as much information as possible so that we can produce a new iteration of the zoning update that news.

71
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,968
[SPEAKER_58]: That new inner iteration will be subject to more public comment.

72
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:13,854
[SPEAKER_58]: We want to give you guys something to react to something new that incorporates all the feedback, very thoughtful and consistent feedback that you've been giving us.

73
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:17,026
[SPEAKER_58]: So I want to put that out there for everybody.

74
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,762
[SPEAKER_58]: If you are attending in person, we do have a physical sign-in sheet.

75
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:32,025
[SPEAKER_58]: You're welcome to sign that if you want to kind of reserve your spot.

76
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,228
[SPEAKER_58]: If you're not comfortable doing that, you will still be able to speak.

77
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:51,740
[SPEAKER_58]: We're just going to be prioritizing people from the June 18th meeting who were not able to speak then, then people who have signed up who have not spoken in previous meetings, and then people who have not signed up are here in person

78
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,635
[SPEAKER_58]: and have not spoke, and then we'll kind of keep circling around.

79
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:58,837
[SPEAKER_58]: We wanna hear from as many new people as possible.

80
00:06:59,137 --> 00:07:06,983
[SPEAKER_58]: And we hope that you can understand why we're doing that and also respect your fellow citizens in their time to give new and thoughtful comment.

81
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:08,805
[SPEAKER_58]: So thank you in advance for that.

82
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,889
[SPEAKER_58]: As usual with Zoom, we're gonna use the raise hand function.

83
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,631
[SPEAKER_58]: I see a couple of hands are already popping up.

84
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,192
[SPEAKER_58]: You're welcome to start raising your hands.

85
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,356
[SPEAKER_58]: We'll keep track of those.

86
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:26,919
[SPEAKER_58]: with our mighty planning interns.

87
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:41,548
[SPEAKER_58]: So as a reminder, this is the fifth meeting for the continued public hearing that was open on April 2nd regarding the proposed zoning amendment for the creation of neighborhood and urban residential districts.

88
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:48,030
[SPEAKER_58]: This is our second meeting for the continued public hearing that was open on June 18th regarding the accessory dwelling unit.

89
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:57,193
[SPEAKER_58]: And this is the third meeting for the continued public hearing that was opened on June 4th regarding the proposed zoning amendment for the creation of West Medford Square districts.

90
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:11,185
[SPEAKER_58]: Do we have anyone, any board members that needed to watch recordings of missed meetings and sign Mullen affidavits?

91
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:12,206
[SPEAKER_58]: I don't believe so.

92
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:21,594
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, I don't believe so, but let's just confirm that before we wrap.

93
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:37,010
[SPEAKER_58]: So I'm gonna pass it over to staff to see if they have any introductory comments before passing it off to the DPW commissioner, Tim McGibbon, Felicia.

94
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:53,159
[SPEAKER_59]: Thank you.

95
00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:01,525
[SPEAKER_41]: So just so that everybody is aware, the city had some email issues over the past 24 hours.

96
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:09,834
[SPEAKER_41]: Most messages were just delayed if anybody received a bounce back that said your email was undeliverable.

97
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:13,959
[SPEAKER_41]: please resend it to the same address, the OCD at Medford.

98
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:22,449
[SPEAKER_41]: It was happening for a couple short windows of time while they were doing some troubleshooting of the email.

99
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,812
[SPEAKER_41]: Almost everything has now come through and been delivered.

100
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:29,036
[SPEAKER_41]: As a reminder, the board will still be receiving

101
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:36,962
[SPEAKER_41]: written comments before deliberating on August 6, and they'll be reviewing the written comment before that date.

102
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:43,407
[SPEAKER_41]: But if you received an email that it was undeliverable, please resend your message to OCD.

103
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:44,268
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

104
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:48,010
[SPEAKER_41]: And then I believe Commissioner McIverton is ready.

105
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,713
[SPEAKER_58]: Do you know if your mic works?

106
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:53,594
[SPEAKER_58]: Testing.

107
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:54,935
[SPEAKER_77]: Testing.

108
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:57,017
[SPEAKER_77]: Does it work?

109
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:01,707
[SPEAKER_77]: Yeah.

110
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:10,035
[SPEAKER_58]: All right.

111
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:12,717
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you so much for being here tonight, Commissioner.

112
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:18,643
[SPEAKER_59]: That's not me.

113
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:26,734
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you for being here tonight, Commissioner McIvern.

114
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:31,677
[SPEAKER_58]: So I'm gonna open it up to members of the board for questions.

115
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:33,718
[SPEAKER_58]: Oh, sorry.

116
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:35,759
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I can just introduce myself real quick.

117
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:38,641
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll just take a couple, not too much time, maybe a minute or so.

118
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:48,806
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been in front of this board as a body multiple times, but I think a lot of you probably are new faces for me and I'm probably a new face for you.

119
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:48,926
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

120
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:55,509
[SPEAKER_27]: How's that?

121
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,471
[SPEAKER_27]: Does that work?

122
00:10:56,952 --> 00:10:57,814
[SPEAKER_27]: Can you guys better?

123
00:10:57,955 --> 00:10:58,235
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

124
00:10:58,436 --> 00:10:58,897
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry about that.

125
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:01,892
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll try to speak slowly too.

126
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:03,353
[SPEAKER_27]: I know a lot of people are trying to hear me.

127
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:06,233
[SPEAKER_27]: So anyway, my name is Tim McGivern.

128
00:11:06,253 --> 00:11:07,474
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much for inviting me.

129
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:08,914
[SPEAKER_27]: I appreciate that.

130
00:11:09,454 --> 00:11:10,994
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm Tim McGivern.

131
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:13,675
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm the commissioner of public works here in the city of Medford.

132
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:19,096
[SPEAKER_27]: The public works, just so you understand what I do here in the city, is made up of seven divisions.

133
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:29,099
[SPEAKER_27]: The water and sewer division, the highway division, the cemetery division, the parks division, forestry, the fleet, including police and the fire.

134
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,781
[SPEAKER_27]: and the engineering division which handles our infrastructure, assets and management.

135
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:46,786
[SPEAKER_27]: We also, you know, as part of that we do O&M and capital improvements for everything but the parks really, and engineering usually leads that effort, water, highway, sewer, drainage improvements.

136
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:50,167
[SPEAKER_27]: Just a little bit of my background so you guys understand my background.

137
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:51,648
[SPEAKER_27]: I came from the engineering side of things.

138
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,389
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been a licensed engineer since

139
00:11:56,373 --> 00:12:06,584
[SPEAKER_27]: 2008.

140
00:11:56,533 --> 00:12:06,584
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe that's the correct date, and I've been practicing engineering since 2004 civil engineering in both land development construction site design as well as utilities.

141
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:10,509
[SPEAKER_27]: And I was a city engineer before being the Commissioner of Public Works.

142
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,751
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know,

143
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:20,858
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of the DPW jurisdictions, authorities, obligations, et cetera, you know, can be impacted by zoning.

144
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,041
[SPEAKER_27]: And, you know, I'm sure you have questions for me.

145
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:30,186
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm here to do my best to answer those questions based off of, you know, what I know today.

146
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:32,688
[SPEAKER_27]: I can look into things if you want as well.

147
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,211
[SPEAKER_27]: And most importantly, I'm here to help the board by

148
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:44,934
[SPEAKER_27]: by answering questions related to your gargantuan task of recommending zoning to our city council.

149
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:47,235
[SPEAKER_27]: So best of luck in the entire project.

150
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:50,296
[SPEAKER_27]: So with that said, I'm here for you.

151
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,316
[SPEAKER_27]: So thank you.

152
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:52,557
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

153
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:58,679
[SPEAKER_58]: Members of the board, do we have any questions for Commissioner McGovern?

154
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:00,379
[SPEAKER_58]: John?

155
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,121
[SPEAKER_40]: Commissioner, can everybody hear me?

156
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:05,801
[SPEAKER_40]: Is that okay?

157
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:15,415
[SPEAKER_40]: I assume you've had an opportunity to look over the proposed zoning changes in Medford?

158
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:17,797
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of it, yeah.

159
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:23,539
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been following along, so to speak, and kind of watching when I can and paying attention when I can.

160
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:32,123
[SPEAKER_40]: Do you foresee problems in any of the divisions you're handling if there is a major increase in density in the city?

161
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:34,544
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a really big question.

162
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:41,848
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think I've studied it to know comprehensively the answer to your question.

163
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,415
[SPEAKER_27]: But I can answer in general, in a general sense.

164
00:13:48,933 --> 00:14:02,541
[SPEAKER_27]: If you think about the infrastructure that supports a city, there's a couple of big ones that DPW operates, water, sewer, and the highway, the roadways.

165
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:11,507
[SPEAKER_27]: So anytime you change zoning, and even backing up one step, in civil engineering in general, you use zoning as a very valuable tool.

166
00:14:12,187 --> 00:14:14,268
[SPEAKER_27]: to base your design off of things.

167
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:27,995
[SPEAKER_27]: So basically if you think about our city now it was designed based off of whatever zoning they were using at that time to design things like the water distribution system, the sewer system the roadway system.

168
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:30,877
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm familiar enough with this particular zoning.

169
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:44,848
[SPEAKER_27]: to know that there aren't any major changes of uses or new zones that have, you know, buildings above 300 or 400 feet, which those types of things significantly impact a city's infrastructure.

170
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:45,769
[SPEAKER_27]: 300 or 400 feet in height.

171
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:45,989
[SPEAKER_58]: Say again?

172
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:57,707
[SPEAKER_27]: What's the what's the dimension like a change of use of a significant change of use, for example, if you're zoning an area for industrial and you're targeting food processing.

173
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:00,450
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, it's a very high water use industry.

174
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:06,957
[SPEAKER_27]: For example, things that going from residential zoning to residential zoning, which I know there's a lot of

175
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:11,199
[SPEAKER_27]: you know, a lot of conversation having to do with that piece of this.

176
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:15,720
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't necessarily design for capacity in those systems.

177
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,521
[SPEAKER_27]: In other words, there's other elements that drive the design, like fitting cameras in pipes, maintaining hydraulic grade lines, things like that.

178
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:25,982
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, most of our streets have eight inch sewer pipes.

179
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:29,883
[SPEAKER_27]: Most of our roads have six inch or eight inch water pipes.

180
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:37,745
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, just to give you an example, an eight inch sewer pipe can drain thousands of households, if not tens of thousands, depending on the whole system.

181
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:44,486
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, there are, and the other important thing to remember is that we already have a capital plan.

182
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:49,327
[SPEAKER_27]: So most of our six inch unlined water pipes, we're already planning to upgrade to eight inch water pipes.

183
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:54,548
[SPEAKER_27]: And that is driven really by fire code, changes in fire codes and how hydrants are done.

184
00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:00,269
[SPEAKER_27]: So because of that, you end up with increased capacity in both of those systems.

185
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,410
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't own a treatment plant.

186
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:12,194
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't own a wastewater treatment plant or a water distribution treatment plant, so we don't have those capacity issues to worry about.

187
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:19,938
[SPEAKER_27]: That's provided by the MWRA, and I believe there's no issues with capacity at the MWRA for those systems.

188
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:21,459
[SPEAKER_27]: What else?

189
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:27,662
[SPEAKER_27]: Highway, roadway, when you're thinking about zoning, you're thinking about what your obligation is

190
00:16:28,642 --> 00:16:31,324
[SPEAKER_27]: to people who are then developing those parcels.

191
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:41,392
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know, the city may want to look at making betterments to roadways and then figuring out how to pay for those.

192
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:48,477
[SPEAKER_27]: So wearing my DPW commissioner hat, very, you know, very much about money and the steward of the public dollar,

193
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:58,861
[SPEAKER_27]: what I want to see really, so I can help plan the city, is what I need to change my capital plan and revise my capital plan, what those costs look like.

194
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:11,566
[SPEAKER_27]: From an engineering standpoint and from, well, how are we gonna plan our infrastructure moving forward when these zoning changes take place, what I wanna know is how my capital plan is gonna change, really.

195
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:16,588
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's really up to you folks in regards to how much information you want.

196
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:23,929
[SPEAKER_27]: to make the recommendation to the city council on those systems to for you to feel comfortable to be at a point where obviously you can make the recommendation to City Council.

197
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:31,471
[SPEAKER_27]: But what I can't say is I have not looked at the zoning in extreme detail as if I was like a consulting engineer or something like that.

198
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:32,191
[SPEAKER_27]: I haven't done that.

199
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:34,731
[SPEAKER_27]: Um so but at some point it will need to get done.

200
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:40,132
[SPEAKER_27]: You got to look at full build out for approved zoning proposed zoning and what the

201
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,294
[SPEAKER_27]: in some decades.

202
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:53,078
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know the exact number of people that we have shrank by, but we've shrank and then we've grown and we've shrunk and we've grown.

203
00:17:54,378 --> 00:18:09,988
[SPEAKER_27]: So looking at what the full build out is at the end of this and what changes need to happen in our capital planning is really the crux of the matter for me in planning and knowing what to engineer, so to speak.

204
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:13,971
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

205
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:15,552
[SPEAKER_40]: May I follow up with a question?

206
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:23,323
[SPEAKER_40]: Are there any identified sort of choke points in the infrastructure that are of concern to you?

207
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:32,489
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I would say kind of in old cities like this, there are choke points we have two pressure zones for our water system.

208
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:38,132
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know if you want to call it a choke point but you know we had low pressure in an area of the city now we have better pressure.

209
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:42,654
[SPEAKER_27]: We maintain a hydraulic model of our, of our city's water system.

210
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:48,277
[SPEAKER_27]: We know where the low pressure points are we know where the flow problems are the water quality problems are.

211
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:52,321
[SPEAKER_27]: So we might do additional flushing in those areas.

212
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:56,745
[SPEAKER_27]: We may queue them up for improvements or replacements sooner rather than later.

213
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:05,273
[SPEAKER_27]: And then another kind of characteristic of old systems like this are sags and sewer lines that already exist.

214
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:06,955
[SPEAKER_27]: Problems that we know about

215
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:11,158
[SPEAKER_27]: confluence points that maybe are underdesigned or designed wrong.

216
00:19:11,638 --> 00:19:25,448
[SPEAKER_27]: So we know about a lot of these things and any information that we can have knowing what increases we can expect in a certain district or whatever would help us understand those problems better.

217
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,635
[SPEAKER_40]: So what you're saying is you'd look forward to hearing more information

218
00:19:35,360 --> 00:20:03,532
[SPEAKER_27]: About what sort of extra load might be put on systems in the future particularly the near future Yes, yeah, I mean, I think like I said before from a civil engineering standpoint zoning is uh It comes first a lot of the times you look at what's approved zoning and you look at what your goals are Um, and it usually comes down to how much money you're going to spend in a municipal setting Um, and you know, so like I was saying before we already have our six inch online pipes out there in queue for replacement

219
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:06,474
[SPEAKER_27]: We want eight inch water lines in our roads.

220
00:20:06,514 --> 00:20:11,137
[SPEAKER_27]: We all, you know, should want that better flow, you know, unless there are exceptions.

221
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:13,639
[SPEAKER_27]: So don't, don't hang me out to dry for that one.

222
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,260
[SPEAKER_27]: But for the most part, that's the new standard.

223
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:17,701
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're doing that anyway.

224
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:21,704
[SPEAKER_27]: And then as far as roads go, we already have capital improvement plans for roads.

225
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:22,945
[SPEAKER_27]: We're already doing those things.

226
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:31,391
[SPEAKER_27]: But what I would want to know from this effort is do we need to target a certain area for roadway betterments?

227
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:35,494
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that going to be paid for by a general fund?

228
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,056
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that going to be paid by a betterment levy?

229
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:45,301
[SPEAKER_27]: How are those improvements going to be made and how does the city want to target development in those areas, for example?

230
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,681
[SPEAKER_40]: One last question.

231
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:53,944
[SPEAKER_40]: What is your responsibility in regard to private ways?

232
00:20:56,025 --> 00:21:03,130
[SPEAKER_27]: So the city's responsibility on private ways is a big topic.

233
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:08,174
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a lot of legal gray area, but my understanding

234
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:17,368
[SPEAKER_27]: If you could, if we're talking about zoning here, I'll just talk about sort of legal, what I believe is legal jurisdiction and what we are, can and can't do.

235
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,794
[SPEAKER_27]: So the jurisdiction is, we don't really have any, but we do have an obligation to things like public safety.

236
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:34,020
[SPEAKER_27]: So the general public, it is my belief that an understanding interpretation that the public has a right to pass through private ways.

237
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:34,901
[SPEAKER_27]: So,

238
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:37,803
[SPEAKER_27]: The public has rights in public ways.

239
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:38,723
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what that means.

240
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:40,704
[SPEAKER_27]: So we would protect those rights.

241
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:50,028
[SPEAKER_27]: So that may mean we chop down a tree because it's imminently gonna fall and we don't know who owns the tree because it's on a private way or they're not taking ownership of it and we need action.

242
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:53,589
[SPEAKER_27]: That could be an example of us taking action on a private way.

243
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:58,731
[SPEAKER_27]: Filling potholes is another thing we do on private ways, repairing plow damage, things like that.

244
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:03,573
[SPEAKER_27]: The land is not under the care and control of the city and we're not allowed to spend public tax dollars on it.

245
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:04,353
[SPEAKER_27]: the city.

246
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:15,841
[SPEAKER_27]: Um but under an effort like this, if the city is targeting private ways for betterments and public acceptance, then the DPW role changes in the engineering department.

247
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:30,150
[SPEAKER_27]: The engineering division would through the city engineer would handle the taking the betterments creating those estimates and going through that process to make a private way a public way.

248
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:43,768
[SPEAKER_40]: In terms of sewer and water, you're familiar with whatever amenities have been provided in the private ways?

249
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:44,829
[SPEAKER_40]: Say again?

250
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:52,028
[SPEAKER_40]: You I'm sure you have detailed knowledge of all the sewer lines and water lines throughout the city.

251
00:22:52,148 --> 00:22:54,629
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm just asking, does that include the private ways?

252
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:55,749
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, it does.

253
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:58,770
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have utility easements in most of the private ways.

254
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,470
[SPEAKER_27]: If we don't, we should.

255
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,211
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, people usually want us to service the sewer and the water systems as well.

256
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,372
[SPEAKER_27]: So you're welcome.

257
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:18,430
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you for those questions, John.

258
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,914
[SPEAKER_58]: I do have a follow up question based on what you said to John.

259
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:28,718
[SPEAKER_58]: So you mentioned that, you know, you wouldn't do like the detailed review.

260
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:42,470
[SPEAKER_58]: And that leads to another question of like, you know, what level of involvement or review feedback, whatever you want to call it, would be typical or appropriate for the public works to have at this point?

261
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:45,064
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a good question.

262
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:46,186
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't necessarily have an answer for you.

263
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:47,809
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think there's any necessarily rulebook.

264
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:48,510
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not a planner.

265
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:58,425
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know the ins and outs of this process to make new zoning, but I am very familiar with how to engineer things based off of new zoning.

266
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:08,673
[SPEAKER_27]: And my statement before about this board, what information does this board need to feel comfortable to make a recommendation?

267
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:10,655
[SPEAKER_27]: That's really up to you guys.

268
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:12,876
[SPEAKER_27]: From what I understand, there's no really rule book on this.

269
00:24:13,877 --> 00:24:19,501
[SPEAKER_27]: You could spend millions and millions of dollars studying things to the end of time.

270
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:24,905
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's really up to you guys and your comfort level on passing a recommendation.

271
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:36,413
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll tell you right now, if the board asks me and the DPW, probably through engineering, to do those types of cost estimates, we'd have to schedule it, we'd have to make time.

272
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:43,798
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an effort for sure, but I want to kind of go back to the idea that we're already doing a lot of improvements.

273
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,763
[SPEAKER_27]: I've reviewed the zoning, the biggest change, and again, I didn't go through everything in detail, I did not.

274
00:24:52,444 --> 00:25:04,492
[SPEAKER_27]: you're if you were to say pay a civil engineer to analyze this zoning and this change, they're going to be looking for things like change in use, change in types of flow, any flow intensities that they need to be aware about.

275
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:17,521
[SPEAKER_27]: And then, you know, if we're taking areas of the city and we're saying, okay, we're gonna double the flow on a residential area, well, then you also have to take into consideration the reduction in flow that we're taking in because of that development.

276
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,723
[SPEAKER_27]: We remove four times as much

277
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:29,385
[SPEAKER_27]: and infiltration from our sewer on large development projects to make room for more water, if that makes sense.

278
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:50,612
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's not just increasing the population isn't something that would necessarily set us on a path of updating the water system and the sewer system in that road, unless you're doing things like high rises where you need a second water source and maybe we don't have it.

279
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:52,473
[SPEAKER_27]: So something like that.

280
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,034
[SPEAKER_27]: Hopefully that answers the question.

281
00:25:55,494 --> 00:26:12,822
[SPEAKER_27]: So really professionally, if I put on my just civil engineering consultant hat on and went back in time for 10 years, I would probably say, depending on what you wanna know about what system, because there's so many, not just what DPW is doing, but whatever impacts there are to the city.

282
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:20,704
[SPEAKER_27]: But just civil engineering, just our systems, then I would say the same thing that I said to you before.

283
00:26:20,824 --> 00:26:23,465
[SPEAKER_27]: We'd want to look at the max build-out condition.

284
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:34,408
[SPEAKER_27]: We'd want to look at any changes of uses, changes of flows, types of flows, any significant increases in demands on the system, and then assign cost estimates for those.

285
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:39,530
[SPEAKER_27]: So then they can be incorporated into the CIP that the DPW does every year.

286
00:26:40,855 --> 00:26:42,036
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's really what it comes down to.

287
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:48,422
[SPEAKER_27]: Zoning executes itself over decades, just like our capital planning.

288
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:55,108
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's kind of like looking into the future and projecting what the needs of the infrastructure will be, and then reacting to that.

289
00:26:56,389 --> 00:27:01,454
[SPEAKER_27]: It may cost the city more money in capital planning for some of these zoning changes.

290
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:04,737
[SPEAKER_27]: And like I said, I would want to know

291
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:11,542
[SPEAKER_27]: at some point in this process, what City Council has approved, what you guys have recommended.

292
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:25,492
[SPEAKER_27]: So depending on what you guys do and have for information, regardless, we in my offices would take the final zoning and begin our capital planning process regardless.

293
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:28,455
[SPEAKER_58]: That's very helpful.

294
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:29,796
[SPEAKER_58]: And yeah, it's very clear.

295
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:30,757
[SPEAKER_58]: There are no rules.

296
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:34,719
[SPEAKER_27]: And I- Well, you guys kind of get to make them a little bit, so.

297
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:40,002
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, we're making it right for Medford, which has been a very collaborative process.

298
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:40,782
[SPEAKER_58]: So that's been nice.

299
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:46,005
[SPEAKER_58]: I see that we have the mayor on Zoom.

300
00:27:46,305 --> 00:27:48,906
[SPEAKER_58]: So I did want to go over to Brianna.

301
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:57,392
[SPEAKER_58]: Alicia, are you able to unmute her?

302
00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:58,813
[SPEAKER_58]: I think I'm on.

303
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:01,315
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me?

304
00:28:02,296 --> 00:28:02,536
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

305
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:06,159
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, chair and board.

306
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,220
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate you allowing me to speak.

307
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:12,585
[SPEAKER_21]: I like so many others are away this week.

308
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:20,971
[SPEAKER_21]: Just like I said, I really was hoping that you all and the city didn't have to go through this type of meeting during the 4th of July week.

309
00:28:21,652 --> 00:28:24,254
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't go away much, but I am away with my family.

310
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,756
[SPEAKER_21]: And I appreciate Commissioner McGiven being there.

311
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:30,538
[SPEAKER_21]: And he is explaining, I think all the needs of the city.

312
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:32,760
[SPEAKER_21]: So just on the DPW realm.

313
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:36,103
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have over 50 million worth of

314
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,704
[SPEAKER_21]: lead lines to fix.

315
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:45,648
[SPEAKER_21]: We have 200 million more just to do streets and sidewalks on public ways.

316
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:52,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we have our water and sewer infrastructure to work, which is a couple of hundred million dollars we need to do.

317
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:58,758
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is just DPW on a higher level, never mind the CIP list of vehicles that we need.

318
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:06,546
[SPEAKER_58]: I'd request that people who have phones or anything that's producing audio in the chambers, please silence those or step out until you're able to silence.

319
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:06,966
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

320
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:18,775
[SPEAKER_21]: So when you talk about our schools, we just commissioned a study to try to find more capacity because our elementary schools are, except the Mississippi, are busting at the seams.

321
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:24,219
[SPEAKER_21]: There is no room, absolutely no room.

322
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:28,442
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm not sure if the superintendent will comment, but we finally did send an email today

323
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:44,328
[SPEAKER_21]: thanks to my request to ask department heads for a comment and I know there's a couple other people including candidates running for office that are asking for these things too but our schools especially our elementary schools are busting at the seams.

324
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:46,389
[SPEAKER_21]: We

325
00:29:48,105 --> 00:29:53,534
[SPEAKER_21]: Lease and fire, we're trying to hire, we are working through it, but budgets are tight.

326
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:54,736
[SPEAKER_21]: We are not Somerville.

327
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:59,424
[SPEAKER_21]: We have about $120 million less to spend per year than Somerville.

328
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,206
[SPEAKER_21]: difference grows each year.

329
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:08,268
[SPEAKER_21]: So believe me, I want to rezone the city.

330
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:16,992
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to create more affordable housing, but the rate that we are doing it with multiple amendments at the same time

331
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:36,038
[SPEAKER_21]: Where we have when I respond to residents on email I have to refer to a color-coded map on When public comments do when the CD boards meeting when the City Council's meeting which amendment I am so confused My comms team is so confused

332
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:37,439
[SPEAKER_21]: We cannot keep up.

333
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,601
[SPEAKER_21]: I cannot keep up this pace.

334
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:51,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Believe me, and I'm really focused on zoning as the majority of my job right now, but we're doing our residents a disservice to continue at this pace.

335
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,052
[SPEAKER_21]: We're doing your board a disservice.

336
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:55,233
[SPEAKER_21]: We're doing my staff a disservice.

337
00:30:56,234 --> 00:31:19,153
[SPEAKER_21]: continue like this so I am like up the letter I sent last week I'm begging you please slow this down we just alone we have created Mr. Gav 14 stories we are in Salem Street and I did ask that the CD boards recommend recommendations be included in the council's vote and I know most were maybe one wasn't

338
00:31:20,517 --> 00:31:21,978
[SPEAKER_21]: But that is, that is rezoned.

339
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,060
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford Square, West Medford Square, you have all the squares, all the corridors.

340
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we please do that first?

341
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:42,907
[SPEAKER_21]: The division that the, and I'm going to be honest, and I'll take part of the blame, the ultimate failure of city departments working together

342
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:51,781
[SPEAKER_21]: including PDS and communications in my office on trying to communicate this out to residents, I'll take the blame.

343
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:53,523
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an ultimate failure.

344
00:31:53,923 --> 00:32:08,594
[SPEAKER_21]: And I am every day getting five to 10 emails of people that are either for and now mostly against because people are realizing, wait a second, you are zoning my neighborhood as 10 units per lot.

345
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:11,096
[SPEAKER_21]: That is not gonna create affordable housing.

346
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:14,287
[SPEAKER_21]: What, let's take our time.

347
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,888
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do this right.

348
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:16,909
[SPEAKER_21]: We can do this.

349
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,650
[SPEAKER_21]: We are a strong city.

350
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,051
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a strong council.

351
00:32:20,451 --> 00:32:21,952
[SPEAKER_21]: They're hard workers.

352
00:32:22,392 --> 00:32:29,476
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a PDS department that knows their stuff, but for the rapid speed this is going at is not right.

353
00:32:30,097 --> 00:32:30,817
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just not right.

354
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:31,578
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not fair.

355
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:36,081
[SPEAKER_21]: The division, I just really feel bad for our community right now.

356
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:38,422
[SPEAKER_21]: And I feel bad for this board that has to deal with it.

357
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:39,383
[SPEAKER_21]: You all seem,

358
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:42,006
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, it's just too much.

359
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,008
[SPEAKER_21]: So why don't we take the quarters?

360
00:32:44,748 --> 00:32:45,949
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's take the squares.

361
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:47,150
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do those first.

362
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,991
[SPEAKER_21]: And let's be honest with the people.

363
00:32:49,712 --> 00:32:49,952
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

364
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:59,299
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have control of how this is going to play out, how this is going to be rezoned, how the parking changes are going to happen, nor does my PDS staff.

365
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:06,758
[SPEAKER_21]: take the quarters, the squares first, and then let's figure out the residential neighborhoods.

366
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:11,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's figure out what parking minimums will be, and let's, we can do this.

367
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:15,720
[SPEAKER_21]: If Somerville took seven years, why are we trying to do it in a year?

368
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:23,803
[SPEAKER_21]: And I understand master plan, housing production plan, we have it all, but that's not included in just this rapid speed.

369
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:26,564
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just, I beg of you, like, please slow this down.

370
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,800
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you so much, Mayor, for coming and speaking before our board this evening.

371
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:07,350
[SPEAKER_58]: It means a lot that you're spending your free time to provide your insight and influence to the board.

372
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,530
[SPEAKER_58]: You.

373
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:49,038
[SPEAKER_58]: and recognizing that we have Commissioner McGibbon in front of us.

374
00:34:49,058 --> 00:34:53,841
[SPEAKER_58]: I did want to give Tim a chance to respond to anything that the mayor said.

375
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:55,482
[SPEAKER_58]: I didn't hear any specific questions.

376
00:34:56,343 --> 00:35:02,167
[SPEAKER_58]: I know she did echo kind of your sentiment on the capital planning, but was there anything you wanted to add?

377
00:35:03,624 --> 00:35:06,405
[SPEAKER_27]: She went over some numbers and those numbers are real.

378
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:09,065
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we do have a lot of work on the water side.

379
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:13,606
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we're doing that work for sure.

380
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:20,027
[SPEAKER_27]: We, I think as she mentioned lead, I might as well just pick up on that a little bit, because I know that that's worrisome to folks.

381
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:27,389
[SPEAKER_27]: There's no immediate danger to folks, but we are planning on a significantly large project to remove the lead lines in the city.

382
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:31,170
[SPEAKER_27]: So anyway, people will learn more of that as we go along.

383
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,110
[SPEAKER_27]: So that was that reference.

384
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:37,050
[SPEAKER_27]: But in general, no, we do have a lot of work to do in this city.

385
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:52,160
[SPEAKER_27]: The capital needs are large and some of the largest ones, if not the largest ones, have to do with our water system because of its age and the road system, again, because of its age and a lot of deferred maintenance.

386
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,003
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have big bills to pay over the coming decades for those systems.

387
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,430
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you for that insight.

388
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:05,712
[SPEAKER_58]: I see board member Peter Calves has his hand raised.

389
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:06,092
[SPEAKER_58]: Peter?

390
00:36:09,813 --> 00:36:11,533
[SPEAKER_69]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

391
00:36:12,413 --> 00:36:20,996
[SPEAKER_69]: First, before I get to my question for Commissioner McGivern, I would like to... This may be a more general question.

392
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:22,356
[SPEAKER_69]: It's a process question.

393
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:23,897
[SPEAKER_69]: I recognize that.

394
00:36:26,657 --> 00:36:27,838
[SPEAKER_69]: Based on some of the

395
00:36:29,707 --> 00:36:30,667
[SPEAKER_69]: comments from the mayor.

396
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:38,131
[SPEAKER_69]: I would like to ask at what point was this kind of process speed decided?

397
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:47,594
[SPEAKER_69]: Because I mean, as much as the mayor is asking us to, us as a board to slow this process down, we kind of initially at least did not decide on this pace.

398
00:36:47,654 --> 00:36:53,497
[SPEAKER_69]: We picked up these articles as they're handed to us from city council.

399
00:36:53,557 --> 00:36:55,958
[SPEAKER_69]: So that might be a more general question.

400
00:36:56,743 --> 00:36:59,425
[SPEAKER_69]: And I don't know if anyone has an answer to it offhand.

401
00:36:59,465 --> 00:37:05,029
[SPEAKER_69]: But my question is, who, because she references trying to do the whole thing in a year.

402
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,511
[SPEAKER_69]: And I'm like, I don't remember deciding that.

403
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:13,916
[SPEAKER_69]: We just picked up the amendments as they were handed to us from city council.

404
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,140
[SPEAKER_58]: Alicia, do you have any insight on that?

405
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,122
[SPEAKER_58]: Kind of like, what drove the initial timeline?

406
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,852
[SPEAKER_41]: It's a city council initiative.

407
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,536
[SPEAKER_41]: The city council has been meeting.

408
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:38,631
[SPEAKER_41]: They worked with the city to hire a consultant 18 months ago who's been working on this project, and they've been meeting regularly for over a year now on this.

409
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:43,676
[SPEAKER_41]: Um, so that's that's the driver behind the project.

410
00:37:44,037 --> 00:37:49,301
[SPEAKER_41]: I do just want to acknowledge that Commissioner McGivern is only available until a few minutes before eight.

411
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:53,505
[SPEAKER_41]: So I think we really need to focus on questions the board has for him.

412
00:37:54,086 --> 00:38:00,432
[SPEAKER_41]: And then after we don't have him anymore, if you wanted to talk on other topics that would make more sense.

413
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:06,255
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, that was the intent, because we're gonna ask Commissioner McIvern questions, and we're gonna go into public comment.

414
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:18,922
[SPEAKER_58]: And then, as time allows, we may have board conversation, but looking at the number of people here in public, in person, as well as on Zoom, I think our focus this evening is gonna be public comment.

415
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:20,362
[SPEAKER_69]: Okay, no problem.

416
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:30,248
[SPEAKER_69]: And then, in that case, my question for Commissioner McIvern would be, is there a, to your knowledge,

417
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:41,842
[SPEAKER_69]: kind of scaling factor for, just to use an example, water system capacity.

418
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:57,376
[SPEAKER_69]: When a street goes from, say, 100 households to 150 households to 200 households or something like that, is there a factor for that or a process of analysis for that that is something that's

419
00:38:58,527 --> 00:38:58,707
[SPEAKER_27]: OK.

420
00:38:58,807 --> 00:38:59,367
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, there is.

421
00:38:59,407 --> 00:38:59,667
[SPEAKER_27]: There is.

422
00:38:59,827 --> 00:39:03,428
[SPEAKER_27]: So as I mentioned before, we have a hydraulic model for our water system.

423
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:07,970
[SPEAKER_27]: So you plug in those capacities to see how the system reacts.

424
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:14,111
[SPEAKER_27]: And then that helps us identify places in the system that we need to spend money, really.

425
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:17,092
[SPEAKER_27]: Upgrades, improvements.

426
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:19,613
[SPEAKER_69]: Great.

427
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:20,793
[SPEAKER_69]: Thank you.

428
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:21,473
[SPEAKER_69]: That was my question.

429
00:39:21,513 --> 00:39:26,495
[SPEAKER_69]: Just wanted to find out if there is a process for that, considering all the concern we've heard around that.

430
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:28,417
[SPEAKER_69]: Yep.

431
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:30,859
[SPEAKER_68]: That's what the civil engineers out there do.

432
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:32,281
[SPEAKER_68]: That's one of their tasks.

433
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:35,283
[SPEAKER_68]: I'm aware as a practicing civil engineer.

434
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:36,544
[SPEAKER_68]: Oh, all right.

435
00:39:36,604 --> 00:39:36,984
[SPEAKER_68]: Okay.

436
00:39:37,024 --> 00:39:38,405
[SPEAKER_68]: So, you know, okay.

437
00:39:38,465 --> 00:39:40,087
[SPEAKER_68]: So a lot of the stuff I'm saying, you know, okay, good.

438
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:41,688
[SPEAKER_68]: Yeah, no, just to confirm.

439
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:42,409
[SPEAKER_68]: Thank you.

440
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:43,530
[SPEAKER_68]: You're welcome.

441
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:46,612
[SPEAKER_58]: Expert to expert conversation right there.

442
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:51,016
[SPEAKER_58]: The next hand I see is Ari Goffman-Fishman.

443
00:39:52,954 --> 00:40:00,521
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you madam chair and thank you for joining the board and answering questions for us in the public.

444
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:05,766
[SPEAKER_38]: We really appreciate your time and all the hard work you've been doing for the city.

445
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:12,092
[SPEAKER_38]: My question is about kind of the conversations you've had so far.

446
00:40:12,692 --> 00:40:31,499
[SPEAKER_38]: Would it be possible to summarize with the acknowledgement that this isn't like a forensic audit or anything, just kind of broad thematic summaries of conversations you've had with OPD staff, city council members, and or the mayor's office about public works concerns related to zoning and any possible solutions that have come out of it?

447
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:34,840
[SPEAKER_38]: Is there anything that you've identified as either insurmountable,

448
00:40:35,461 --> 00:40:43,879
[SPEAKER_38]: Or as likely to cause problems of a significantly larger magnitude than the standard challenges we face every year of an old density.

449
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:45,629
[SPEAKER_27]: questions.

450
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:56,715
[SPEAKER_27]: Sure Um, I've had some discussions with those people that you have mentioned over over time, just by nature of my job, whether it's a city council member, you know, asking me something.

451
00:40:56,735 --> 00:40:58,776
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm Alicia Hunt asking me something.

452
00:40:58,796 --> 00:40:59,617
[SPEAKER_27]: Um.

453
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:01,618
[SPEAKER_27]: The mayor asking me something.

454
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:03,018
[SPEAKER_27]: Chief of staff asking me something.

455
00:41:03,038 --> 00:41:05,760
[SPEAKER_27]: It hasn't been substantial.

456
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,041
[SPEAKER_27]: And could it be

457
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:19,655
[SPEAKER_27]: And then as far as, are you asking like what my take on it, if I see any red flags, so to speak, is that what you're asking?

458
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:22,638
[SPEAKER_38]: I would love to hear those.

459
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:27,121
[SPEAKER_38]: I think the question was more of any conversations you've had about red flags, green flags.

460
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:33,487
[SPEAKER_38]: But if there are any red flags that you have that you haven't discussed with them, I would very much also love to know that.

461
00:41:33,547 --> 00:41:33,847
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

462
00:41:34,612 --> 00:41:36,293
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I can tell you where the concerns lie.

463
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:40,017
[SPEAKER_27]: But as I stated before, I haven't done any sort of deep analysis on this.

464
00:41:40,577 --> 00:41:46,122
[SPEAKER_27]: So ultimately, the answer is I don't know until I do know.

465
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:58,393
[SPEAKER_27]: But the conversations kind of, I would say, more wrap around process, expectations, obligations, authorities, jurisdictions, if that's helpful.

466
00:41:58,593 --> 00:42:00,575
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that's very high level, but that's the truth of it.

467
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:03,985
[SPEAKER_27]: So hopefully that answers your question.

468
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,787
[SPEAKER_27]: Not about the specifics of is this gonna impact.

469
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:18,534
[SPEAKER_27]: Sometimes I've personally thought about without talking to anybody what some of the impacts might be and how they might impact our capital plan and kind of looking at where there's any changes of use.

470
00:42:18,694 --> 00:42:23,637
[SPEAKER_27]: As I stated before, changes of use is usually a pretty big deal when it comes to civil infrastructure engineering.

471
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:24,978
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're looking at that.

472
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:31,762
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I'm looking at that just for my own curiosities to know how this is gonna end up

473
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:35,570
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

474
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,612
[SPEAKER_38]: I appreciate your insight.

475
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:38,013
[SPEAKER_27]: You're welcome.

476
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:41,257
[SPEAKER_58]: Ben.

477
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,860
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you, Emily.

478
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:45,342
[SPEAKER_48]: Thanks for being here.

479
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:46,624
[SPEAKER_48]: Sure.

480
00:42:47,144 --> 00:42:53,172
[SPEAKER_48]: I just want to echo Peter's point that

481
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,726
[SPEAKER_48]: you know, the sort of timelines.

482
00:42:58,586 --> 00:43:05,248
[SPEAKER_48]: This board kind of inherits a docket of things to review, and we do the best that we can.

483
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:12,311
[SPEAKER_48]: It's not that there's any timeline that the board has or desires.

484
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,592
[SPEAKER_48]: It's that we sort of get what's handed to us, right?

485
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:16,352
[SPEAKER_48]: So I just wanted to

486
00:43:17,213 --> 00:43:17,974
[SPEAKER_48]: emphasize that.

487
00:43:18,114 --> 00:43:29,047
[SPEAKER_48]: One of the things that, um, has concerned me about this process is that the city does have significant budget considerations in the coming.

488
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:35,014
[SPEAKER_48]: I mean, right now, right, particularly with school systems and other parts of the city budget.

489
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:37,397
[SPEAKER_48]: And I would think that

490
00:43:38,378 --> 00:43:45,445
[SPEAKER_48]: a comprehensive zoning overhaul for a department like yours would have significant budget implications over time.

491
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:53,432
[SPEAKER_48]: You've sort of validated that hunch that I had, and I'm curious, you know, short of like

492
00:43:54,507 --> 00:44:03,654
[SPEAKER_48]: sticking to the comprehensive plan and improving, you know, increasing density and improving affordability, all of which are noble causes, right?

493
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:08,257
[SPEAKER_48]: I don't know that anybody would disagree with that strongly.

494
00:44:10,158 --> 00:44:12,620
[SPEAKER_48]: One of the things that has concerned me is the lack of sort of

495
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,862
[SPEAKER_48]: what are the benefits short of the density and potentially affordability?

496
00:44:20,902 --> 00:44:27,485
[SPEAKER_48]: Though I question how much affordability would really be added or how much it would be improved through these zoning changes.

497
00:44:29,926 --> 00:44:40,391
[SPEAKER_48]: And I'm of the opinion that we would benefit as a city from understanding sort of what do the residents get from a zoning overhaul like this.

498
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:43,572
[SPEAKER_48]: And really that comes down to dollars, right?

499
00:44:48,825 --> 00:44:57,792
[SPEAKER_48]: And so I'm curious if you've received, and if you haven't, I think the answer is that you haven't, but I want you to validate that.

500
00:44:59,693 --> 00:45:08,199
[SPEAKER_48]: Have you received any, here's what this means over time for the budget of the DPW sort of information?

501
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,322
[SPEAKER_48]: Like if we increase density and we're collecting more tax revenue,

502
00:45:13,223 --> 00:45:18,368
[SPEAKER_48]: We expect that this is actually going to solve some of your budget challenges in the coming years.

503
00:45:18,428 --> 00:45:22,512
[SPEAKER_48]: Have you received any sort of analysis on that?

504
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:23,713
[SPEAKER_48]: And if the answer is no,

505
00:45:25,029 --> 00:45:26,710
[SPEAKER_48]: would you benefit from that, right?

506
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:41,341
[SPEAKER_48]: Like if these zoning changes are gonna increase the number of residential units by however many thousand over the next 10 years, that translates to a certain amount of tax revenue, which translates to a certain increase in your budget over time.

507
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:44,103
[SPEAKER_48]: Have you received any forecasting on that?

508
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:47,966
[SPEAKER_48]: And if not, would you benefit from that type of forecast?

509
00:45:48,587 --> 00:45:52,470
[SPEAKER_58]: And also what would be involved in generating a forecast like that, if you know?

510
00:45:55,044 --> 00:46:01,446
[SPEAKER_27]: The revenue piece of it and the finance piece of it is outside of my purview, so I won't be commenting on that.

511
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:08,249
[SPEAKER_27]: However, I will say my professional understanding of public administration

512
00:46:09,049 --> 00:46:16,651
[SPEAKER_27]: is that revenue growth is pretty limited for a municipality in Massachusetts, for various reasons, the number one being proposition two and a half.

513
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:22,132
[SPEAKER_27]: So there's not a lot of options to increase revenue, but I do know that one of them is increasing density, for example.

514
00:46:23,512 --> 00:46:38,436
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I'm constantly, and another thing I can kind of talk about a little bit about this is having to do with budget, kind of at a high level is, you know, one of the things this city is struggling with, as the mayor talked about, is this idea of a backlog.

515
00:46:39,016 --> 00:46:41,417
[SPEAKER_27]: and how much work we do have coming.

516
00:46:41,477 --> 00:46:43,697
[SPEAKER_27]: We know that it's coming because of the age of everything.

517
00:46:44,737 --> 00:46:46,938
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's kind of an important piece of it.

518
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:52,899
[SPEAKER_27]: As far as what the process would be and what I would appreciate knowing, it's similar to what I said before.

519
00:46:52,979 --> 00:47:08,663
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm going to want to know, regardless at some point, whether it was six months ago or six months from now or some other time, I'm going to definitely need to know what the final zoning is, what the final changes are, so I can adjust what my proposed capital planning will be for any

520
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:15,586
[SPEAKER_27]: it could be roads, it could be canopy management, it could be water pipes, it could be anything.

521
00:47:16,846 --> 00:47:20,928
[SPEAKER_48]: And just to follow up, just to make sure that I understand it and that it's clear for the public.

522
00:47:22,616 --> 00:47:27,001
[SPEAKER_48]: your plan would basically be like, here's the number of dollars we think that we need.

523
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:33,328
[SPEAKER_48]: And then whether you get that or how you get that is managed through a different process.

524
00:47:33,388 --> 00:47:34,249
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's not up to me.

525
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:40,757
[SPEAKER_27]: But it is up to me to tell the mayor, and city council, through the mayor,

526
00:47:41,757 --> 00:47:42,738
[SPEAKER_27]: what those needs are.

527
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,880
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think I've done a pretty good job of that.

528
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:51,624
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll just list a couple of things because I can't answer the planning piece of this and what the process may, you know, should look like.

529
00:47:51,644 --> 00:47:53,426
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know what the answer to that question is.

530
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:56,408
[SPEAKER_27]: But I can tell you some of the things that

531
00:47:57,048 --> 00:48:03,491
[SPEAKER_27]: we have done and that would build upon this and what we have used to build out the current capital plan and why we're doing it.

532
00:48:04,272 --> 00:48:13,877
[SPEAKER_27]: For example, we did a few years back, we did the city's first pavement condition index evaluation to get a snapshot of what our pavement condition is out there, both asphalt and concrete.

533
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:15,219
[SPEAKER_27]: So we've done that.

534
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:24,511
[SPEAKER_27]: So that gives us that helps us understand how much impact we or how much improvements we need to make over many years.

535
00:48:25,132 --> 00:48:30,840
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's where like, you know, these large hundreds of millions of dollars backlog come into play that the mayor was talking about.

536
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,882
[SPEAKER_27]: We've also done a utility asset management evaluation.

537
00:48:35,223 --> 00:48:38,845
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's just a fancy way of saying we've looked at our water, sewer, and drainage utilities.

538
00:48:39,225 --> 00:48:40,546
[SPEAKER_27]: We've quantified them.

539
00:48:40,926 --> 00:48:49,192
[SPEAKER_27]: We have gathered a whole bunch of information about them, including the criticality and the probability of failures and what that means.

540
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:51,533
[SPEAKER_27]: That drives our plan.

541
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:56,577
[SPEAKER_27]: We did a water and sewer rate study to attach a rate

542
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,538
[SPEAKER_27]: to our water and sewer improvements over time.

543
00:49:00,078 --> 00:49:00,638
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have that.

544
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:06,881
[SPEAKER_27]: And then most recently, it's not quite published yet or done, but it's almost there, the urban forestry master plan.

545
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:17,865
[SPEAKER_27]: And I will tell you, I've got an early look at these numbers, and we're going to have to invest more in canopy over time if we're going to be serious about things like heat island effect.

546
00:49:18,265 --> 00:49:25,508
[SPEAKER_27]: And it all ties into zoning, too, because if you look at areas like South Medford that's very dense and there's already stormwater and flooding issues,

547
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:41,962
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, things like increasing density, something like that doesn't necessarily impact that, but what it does do is it helps you target areas where you might say, we're going to take a street, and we're going to greenify it we're going to change the curb line to make it safer.

548
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:51,768
[SPEAKER_27]: that may turn into a project for some street based off of what this board recommends for zoning and what City Council passes for zoning.

549
00:49:52,148 --> 00:50:10,819
[SPEAKER_27]: If you have created a zone where you're trying to drive business, the city may want to provide betterments or improvements to that corridor ahead of time and plan for it, as opposed to doing it after the fact or trying to meet our obligations at the moment of a development.

550
00:50:11,553 --> 00:50:12,594
[SPEAKER_27]: Hopefully that answers your question.

551
00:50:13,335 --> 00:50:13,655
[SPEAKER_48]: It does.

552
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:29,368
[SPEAKER_48]: Can I just, and I'll be done after this, but I think what I'm hearing is that more information is useful to your planning and ultimately to putting together the budget that you think you'll need to deliver on all the public services that you're responsible for, which is great.

553
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:33,091
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm of the opinion that it would be prudent

554
00:50:34,213 --> 00:50:45,314
[SPEAKER_48]: for us in this process, even if it takes more time, to be able to go to the commissioner and to other stakeholders and give an indication, do these zoning changes

555
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:47,798
[SPEAKER_48]: improve the outlook?

556
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,319
[SPEAKER_48]: Is it going to solve some of these backlog issues?

557
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:56,280
[SPEAKER_48]: Because there's going to be incremental revenue in the pot, and you can ask for some of that, and that goes through whatever process it needs to go through.

558
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:57,981
[SPEAKER_48]: Or is it actually going to make it worse?

559
00:50:58,501 --> 00:51:01,502
[SPEAKER_48]: And right now, it sounds like we don't know one way or another.

560
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:03,302
[SPEAKER_48]: Is it going to add to the backlog?

561
00:51:03,422 --> 00:51:06,703
[SPEAKER_48]: Is it going to improve the backlog and make more money available?

562
00:51:06,783 --> 00:51:12,745
[SPEAKER_48]: And I just think that it would be prudent for us to be able to give you some kind of a signal one way or another.

563
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:30,065
[SPEAKER_27]: sure that would be helpful like if i have more information obviously i'm going to be able to plan better it's going to it's going to come out better it's going to give you know that always that always is is great but you know like i said before kind of a point you can study something as much as you want um things the things that that

564
00:51:30,972 --> 00:51:34,815
[SPEAKER_27]: are the big things that we're talking about, water, sewer, roadway improvements.

565
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:42,541
[SPEAKER_27]: I guess the point I was trying to make, a lot of those, when I look at what we're changing for zoning, a lot of those improvements and upgrades are already in process happening.

566
00:51:43,362 --> 00:51:48,706
[SPEAKER_27]: Like the water line, I was like, we're already replacing our six inches with eight inches all over the city.

567
00:51:49,007 --> 00:51:55,292
[SPEAKER_27]: So if a residential area goes up by a few units per parcel, that's not gonna make a difference in the water capacity of the water main.

568
00:51:55,672 --> 00:52:04,639
[SPEAKER_27]: What will make a difference is if you build high rises in that zone, and you got a bunch of high rises that all need a second water supply that we don't have.

569
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:08,041
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we may need to build another water main and another street somewhere to provide that.

570
00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:10,062
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's the type of thing that I'm looking for.

571
00:52:10,142 --> 00:52:15,066
[SPEAKER_27]: And like I was saying before, when I look at what we're doing with zoning, I see a lot of upzoning in residential areas.

572
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:20,310
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't see a lot of change of use per se, but again, I haven't looked at it in detail.

573
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:24,514
[SPEAKER_27]: But those are two big things that I'd want to know, really.

574
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:34,946
[SPEAKER_27]: And those are examples too, because as I mentioned, there's also things like Canopy that we could talk about as well, that have an impact on Canopy.

575
00:52:35,929 --> 00:52:45,353
[SPEAKER_27]: We're already doing a lot of the work to build our canopy, and zoning is actually a tool that could be used to help build out the canopy, and I think some of that's happening.

576
00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:49,856
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, zoning can be used as a tool to reduce the stormwater impacts.

577
00:52:51,136 --> 00:52:52,917
[SPEAKER_27]: So that works in the opposite direction, right?

578
00:52:53,157 --> 00:52:57,619
[SPEAKER_27]: So now we're using zoning to help improve those infrastructure aspects.

579
00:52:58,179 --> 00:53:01,361
[SPEAKER_27]: Another example of that is II, infiltration and inflow.

580
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:05,383
[SPEAKER_27]: Whenever there's a development, we get a couple going on right now, like Tufts, for example,

581
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:08,145
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all residential space.

582
00:53:08,665 --> 00:53:15,170
[SPEAKER_27]: So that is providing a certain increase of water that's going to get drained away by our sewer.

583
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:19,272
[SPEAKER_27]: So the purpose isn't to make room in the pipes.

584
00:53:19,492 --> 00:53:20,753
[SPEAKER_27]: The purpose is to reduce II.

585
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:30,000
[SPEAKER_27]: But that project has to remove, and it's just an example, four times the amount of inflow than they're providing for service flow.

586
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:36,265
[SPEAKER_27]: So the more big projects you have, the more II you reduce, the more capacity you open up in the sewer.

587
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:45,892
[SPEAKER_27]: And to tell you the truth, a six-inch, sorry, an eight-inch sewer, which is most of our sewers, can handle flows much higher than just a residential neighborhood.

588
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:47,654
[SPEAKER_27]: That's not why they're eight-inch pipes.

589
00:53:47,814 --> 00:53:50,096
[SPEAKER_27]: They're eight-inch pipes for a variety of other reasons.

590
00:53:51,457 --> 00:53:52,538
[SPEAKER_27]: So hopefully that answers your question.

591
00:53:53,419 --> 00:53:53,699
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

592
00:53:58,411 --> 00:54:02,073
[SPEAKER_58]: So what I'm hearing is more information sooner rather than later.

593
00:54:04,095 --> 00:54:04,935
[SPEAKER_58]: Just high-level summary.

594
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:06,436
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, again, I don't want to put pressure.

595
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:07,537
[SPEAKER_27]: It's up to you guys, really.

596
00:54:07,637 --> 00:54:15,662
[SPEAKER_27]: If you guys feel comfortable passing your recommendation the way it is, I'm going to, no matter what, like I said, react the best I can.

597
00:54:15,682 --> 00:54:16,683
[SPEAKER_58]: Just to be clear, I don't.

598
00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:17,723
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry.

599
00:54:17,884 --> 00:54:20,485
[SPEAKER_58]: I don't feel comfortable passing a recommendation, so.

600
00:54:20,685 --> 00:54:22,346
[SPEAKER_27]: Like I said, that's you guys' decision, so.

601
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:22,447
[SPEAKER_27]: OK.

602
00:54:28,036 --> 00:54:29,577
[SPEAKER_58]: trying to get to public comment as soon as possible.

603
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:31,699
[SPEAKER_58]: Appreciate the applause, but let's hold it, especially for me.

604
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:33,500
[SPEAKER_58]: I don't need it.

605
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:43,127
[SPEAKER_58]: I know we're coming up to your time, so I just want to see if... I don't see other board members with their hands raised.

606
00:54:43,568 --> 00:54:45,089
[SPEAKER_58]: Final call for John, Ben.

607
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:50,193
[SPEAKER_58]: Are there any kind of closing remarks or anything you want to leave us with?

608
00:54:50,873 --> 00:54:51,534
[SPEAKER_27]: Just a thank you.

609
00:54:51,714 --> 00:54:54,756
[SPEAKER_27]: I think this is a very large task for a city.

610
00:54:54,936 --> 00:54:55,617
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that

611
00:54:56,437 --> 00:55:01,482
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, there's only there's only so many ways to increase the revenue of the municipality.

612
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:03,123
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is one of them.

613
00:55:04,124 --> 00:55:04,945
[SPEAKER_27]: So good luck.

614
00:55:05,486 --> 00:55:08,729
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you have any further questions, you can always invite me back.

615
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:12,312
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I can't necessarily commit to

616
00:55:13,613 --> 00:55:29,498
[SPEAKER_27]: to doing a lot of these analysis that you guys that we're talking about today or cost estimates and things like that, but we can talk about how you get those things done and how you might get information that you guys want to see to get you to the point you need to be.

617
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:32,519
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you so much for coming here tonight.

618
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,760
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you for your service to the city as well.

619
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,601
[SPEAKER_58]: We really appreciate it.

620
00:55:35,841 --> 00:55:36,361
[SPEAKER_77]: Doing the best I can.

621
00:55:44,437 --> 00:55:47,779
[SPEAKER_58]: All right, so the next thing we're gonna be doing is opening the public comment period.

622
00:55:49,900 --> 00:56:02,486
[SPEAKER_58]: We did open the public hearings for the neighborhood and urban residential, the ADUs and the squares, but I'm gonna ask that commenters try to prioritize the residential, the neighborhood and urban residential zoning comments.

623
00:56:03,107 --> 00:56:05,508
[SPEAKER_58]: That's what we're trying to get as much as possible of tonight.

624
00:56:11,966 --> 00:56:15,593
[SPEAKER_58]: So those who wish to provide comments that are on Zoom, please raise your hand.

625
00:56:15,853 --> 00:56:18,017
[SPEAKER_58]: I see we already have some people with their hands raised.

626
00:56:19,148 --> 00:56:20,528
[SPEAKER_58]: we will be prioritizing.

627
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:22,649
[SPEAKER_58]: Um those who are here in person.

628
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:23,709
[SPEAKER_58]: You're welcome to sign up.

629
00:56:24,469 --> 00:56:27,370
[SPEAKER_58]: We will also have a period where you know people can just come to the mic.

630
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:33,471
[SPEAKER_58]: We're just trying to kind of keep things flowing as smoothly and as, um, thoughtfully as possible.

631
00:56:34,011 --> 00:56:40,252
[SPEAKER_58]: As mentioned earlier, we will be prioritizing those that signed up during the June 18th meeting that did not have a chance to

632
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:57,523
[SPEAKER_58]: So, and also based on some thoughtful feedback from a fellow board member, we are going to be doing, how many people do we have on our commenting list?

633
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:05,490
[SPEAKER_59]: Christian, does the list include people that have just signed up tonight as well?

634
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:09,854
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm gonna switch it to numbers.

635
00:57:14,138 --> 00:57:14,558
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, that's 40.

636
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,062
[SPEAKER_58]: So we're going to be keeping comments to two minutes per person.

637
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:25,465
[SPEAKER_58]: We have almost 40 people in person, not to mention online.

638
00:57:26,606 --> 00:57:33,850
[SPEAKER_58]: If you're not able to get your comment through in two minutes, I'm going to ask that you follow up via email.

639
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:40,573
[SPEAKER_58]: And then depending on the outcome of tonight, we may also continue this public hearing to seek additional public comment.

640
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:45,484
[SPEAKER_58]: And just some some additional guidance.

641
00:57:45,524 --> 00:57:48,867
[SPEAKER_58]: Like I said, please focus your comments on 80 years and residential zoning.

642
00:57:49,728 --> 00:57:53,773
[SPEAKER_58]: Um and then I also just want to say you guys don't need to thank the board.

643
00:57:55,899 --> 00:57:58,941
[SPEAKER_58]: and also please be respectful of the board as well.

644
00:57:58,961 --> 00:58:04,184
[SPEAKER_58]: I would really appreciate that, but don't thank us, don't waste your time on that.

645
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:15,411
[SPEAKER_58]: If your comment is solely to slow down, we're doing our best and please try to provide feedback that is constructive and specific this evening.

646
00:58:15,751 --> 00:58:20,674
[SPEAKER_58]: We're trying to produce another iteration of this zoning that will have a chance for more public comment.

647
00:58:21,295 --> 00:58:24,097
[SPEAKER_58]: So as rich and specific as you can get it,

648
00:58:25,163 --> 00:58:28,687
[SPEAKER_58]: That will help us improve the next iteration, which you will also be able to comment on.

649
00:58:29,067 --> 00:58:31,570
[SPEAKER_58]: So if slowdown is your comment, we're doing our best.

650
00:58:32,391 --> 00:58:33,472
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you for coming here tonight.

651
00:58:38,947 --> 00:58:41,289
[SPEAKER_58]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address.

652
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:44,212
[SPEAKER_58]: If you're on Zoom, don't use the chat.

653
00:58:44,232 --> 00:58:46,034
[SPEAKER_58]: It's not part of public record.

654
00:58:46,054 --> 00:58:49,577
[SPEAKER_58]: If you're having audio or technical difficulties, you can message staff in the chat.

655
00:58:50,218 --> 00:58:51,158
[SPEAKER_58]: Two minutes to speak.

656
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:57,024
[SPEAKER_58]: And we will be starting with those in person.

657
00:58:57,044 --> 00:59:04,391
[SPEAKER_59]: I think we're gonna do... This list is the list of people who have raised their hand but didn't get called last.

658
00:59:04,731 --> 00:59:05,411
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, I know.

659
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:13,556
[SPEAKER_58]: So some of the people that are on my list may not be here, but they had put their names down last meeting.

660
00:59:13,576 --> 00:59:19,279
[SPEAKER_58]: So I'm gonna do like five in person, and we'll switch over to Zoom.

661
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,641
[SPEAKER_58]: We have the sign up sheets here from last meeting.

662
00:59:22,661 --> 00:59:30,646
[SPEAKER_58]: But we're gonna start with Mary Louise O'Brien, Elise Jennings, and Jennifer Lavoie.

663
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:32,587
[SPEAKER_58]: Are any of those people here tonight?

664
00:59:37,804 --> 00:59:38,084
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi.

665
00:59:38,886 --> 00:59:40,027
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you so much for coming back.

666
00:59:40,087 --> 00:59:40,828
[SPEAKER_58]: I really appreciate it.

667
00:59:45,174 --> 00:59:45,475
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi.

668
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:45,996
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi.

669
00:59:46,196 --> 00:59:48,599
[SPEAKER_36]: Jennifer Lavoie, Century Street Extension.

670
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:51,704
[SPEAKER_36]: I was going to thank the ward.

671
00:59:53,543 --> 01:00:09,667
[SPEAKER_36]: for the opportunity to speak and especially the board members from the last meeting that spoke up for the residents who haven't heard or have just recently heard of these proposals and you sort of stuck up for us and said, let's slow this down.

672
01:00:09,687 --> 01:00:22,890
[SPEAKER_36]: We're hearing that people are just learning of these proposals and we really appreciate that you are letting us speak, digest all of these new ideas and speak.

673
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:27,472
[SPEAKER_36]: I myself have only learned of these proposals just a few short weeks ago.

674
01:00:27,492 --> 01:00:33,434
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm still trying to wrap my head around it and understand these proposals.

675
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:35,015
[SPEAKER_36]: They're very confusing.

676
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:38,076
[SPEAKER_36]: I find the maps very confusing to read.

677
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:41,098
[SPEAKER_36]: There's a couple different versions of maps.

678
01:00:41,598 --> 01:00:42,318
[SPEAKER_36]: that's what I'm looking at.

679
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:52,342
[SPEAKER_36]: The streets when we're looking at the streets, some of them are split right down the middle, one side being zoned one way, another side being zoned another way that doesn't make any sense to me.

680
01:00:53,463 --> 01:01:01,286
[SPEAKER_36]: Some of the single family lots I'm looking at going from single families to multi purpose, which could allow up to a 5 to

681
01:01:07,528 --> 01:01:10,109
[SPEAKER_58]: Do you have any specific addresses or lots that you're referring to?

682
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:12,210
[SPEAKER_36]: It's okay if you don't, but I'd love it if you could follow up.

683
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:14,751
[SPEAKER_36]: I can tell you the street is Cottage Street.

684
01:01:15,431 --> 01:01:19,373
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't want to mention any particular in case the person's here.

685
01:01:19,393 --> 01:01:25,095
[SPEAKER_36]: I do know people on that street are getting harassed already by developers.

686
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:26,856
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a big lot.

687
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,019
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a very small house on the lot.

688
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,627
[SPEAKER_36]: And if somebody can build a five to seven story building, they're going to do it.

689
01:01:34,807 --> 01:01:40,394
[SPEAKER_36]: And honestly, I don't think any of the developers are looking to build affordable units.

690
01:01:40,855 --> 01:01:42,878
[SPEAKER_36]: That's really not what they're all about.

691
01:01:50,238 --> 01:01:52,219
[SPEAKER_36]: I tried to read the comprehensive plan.

692
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:58,922
[SPEAKER_36]: It's quite long, but they did call for some studies and assessments in that comprehensive plan.

693
01:01:59,943 --> 01:02:05,685
[SPEAKER_36]: And I'm wondering if those assessments and studies have been done, and if so, where are they?

694
01:02:07,086 --> 01:02:09,867
[SPEAKER_36]: Is the public able to read them or see them?

695
01:02:11,248 --> 01:02:11,588
[SPEAKER_36]: That's it.

696
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:13,429
[SPEAKER_36]: I just really, you know, slow this down.

697
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:15,630
[SPEAKER_36]: Like the mayor said, slow it down.

698
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:23,192
[SPEAKER_36]: start with the ADUs and the squares, get that right, you know, see how that goes and go from there.

699
01:02:23,212 --> 01:02:25,512
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Jennifer.

700
01:02:25,532 --> 01:02:33,314
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Ann MacDonald, Anita Goldberg, Parkman Lovering.

701
01:02:34,254 --> 01:02:35,294
[SPEAKER_58]: Are any of them here tonight?

702
01:02:36,414 --> 01:02:39,435
[SPEAKER_58]: Ann MacDonald, Anita Goldberg, Parkman Lovering.

703
01:02:48,984 --> 01:02:49,784
[SPEAKER_73]: apartment lovering.

704
01:02:49,824 --> 01:02:51,725
[SPEAKER_73]: I live in Warren Street in West Medford.

705
01:02:52,245 --> 01:02:58,907
[SPEAKER_73]: And by looking at your chart here, it's going to affect my piece of property considerably.

706
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:14,812
[SPEAKER_73]: I'm going to look out if a developer takes a good chunk of the square from Warren Street to Placeton Road, and he decides to build a seven to eight story building, I'm going to be looking out at it, especially the way you have it here.

707
01:03:15,905 --> 01:03:18,967
[SPEAKER_73]: I live between High Street and Irving Street.

708
01:03:19,207 --> 01:03:22,048
[SPEAKER_73]: There are four homes on my side of the street.

709
01:03:22,408 --> 01:03:24,669
[SPEAKER_73]: I'm the only owner-occupied home.

710
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:29,352
[SPEAKER_73]: We presently have parking issues on Warren Street.

711
01:03:30,112 --> 01:03:35,355
[SPEAKER_73]: And if building another big building with apartments or condos, we're going to have issues again.

712
01:03:36,215 --> 01:03:39,597
[SPEAKER_73]: So I'm concerned about water, fire,

713
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:52,804
[SPEAKER_73]: and an increase in our police department if you continue to push high-rises or units in our neighborhoods that are traditionally single-family homes.

714
01:03:54,005 --> 01:03:58,748
[SPEAKER_73]: And it will just ruin the characteristic- 30 seconds.

715
01:03:59,168 --> 01:03:59,389
[SPEAKER_58]: Huh?

716
01:03:59,409 --> 01:03:59,789
[SPEAKER_58]: 30 seconds.

717
01:03:59,929 --> 01:04:00,109
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay.

718
01:04:00,709 --> 01:04:06,053
[SPEAKER_73]: It's just gonna ruin the characteristic of our communities, our neighborhoods.

719
01:04:06,573 --> 01:04:08,715
[SPEAKER_73]: The reason people came to Medfair

720
01:04:09,815 --> 01:04:14,357
[SPEAKER_73]: drive through Somerville and other cities, and it's just so congested.

721
01:04:14,997 --> 01:04:18,759
[SPEAKER_73]: I feel sorry for the old timers that are there that have to put up with it.

722
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:25,421
[SPEAKER_73]: I really hope the city council does not support this, which I know they do.

723
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:26,962
[SPEAKER_73]: Okay, I'll go.

724
01:04:27,482 --> 01:04:28,142
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Parkland.

725
01:04:28,162 --> 01:04:28,943
[SPEAKER_58]: I appreciate your comment.

726
01:04:33,645 --> 01:04:38,887
[SPEAKER_58]: The next commenters that we have are Diane Hatch, Peter Sigourney, Ellen Epstein,

727
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,611
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, my name's Peter Sigurdi.

728
01:04:54,831 --> 01:04:56,572
[SPEAKER_18]: I live at 21 Jackson Road.

729
01:04:58,473 --> 01:05:02,075
[SPEAKER_18]: My wife and I moved to Medford seven years ago.

730
01:05:03,656 --> 01:05:04,856
[SPEAKER_18]: I've lived this firsthand.

731
01:05:04,896 --> 01:05:06,317
[SPEAKER_18]: We moved from West Cambridge.

732
01:05:07,558 --> 01:05:20,065
[SPEAKER_18]: And about 10 years ago, the planning board in Cambridge was proposing roughly 5 million square feet of residential in the roughly alewife,

733
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:22,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Fresh pond area.

734
01:05:23,111 --> 01:05:26,332
[SPEAKER_18]: Not sure what the final number was, but they've built out a lot of real estate there.

735
01:05:27,273 --> 01:05:32,915
[SPEAKER_18]: And the traffic became unbearable.

736
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Part of why we bought on Jack's Road was because it was a

737
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:45,446
[SPEAKER_18]: wonderful, quiet neighborhood, kids riding bikes on the street, listening to songbirds, without a lot of traffic.

738
01:05:46,127 --> 01:05:48,369
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, as I said, I've seen this firsthand.

739
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:56,115
[SPEAKER_18]: These sorts of changes will forever destroy the character of some of these neighborhoods in Medford.

740
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:04,555
[SPEAKER_18]: As I said, we live in the Huron Village area in Cambridge.

741
01:06:05,096 --> 01:06:07,699
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to see what this looks like, go over there.

742
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:16,189
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's a 10-minute drive, well, possibly a 25- or 30-minute drive, but going through Alewife and all that is an absolute nightmare.

743
01:06:17,688 --> 01:06:37,538
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, the voices of, you know, slow down makes sense to me, you know, hearing that the DPW is not in sync on this, and it's no fault of the commissioner, but it seems as if, you know, at present, we're looking to pass this sort of rezoning and then figure out how much it's going to cost the residents of the city.

744
01:06:37,558 --> 01:06:39,039
[SPEAKER_18]: 30 seconds.

745
01:06:39,219 --> 01:06:40,240
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'll leave it at that.

746
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:40,800
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks.

747
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,520
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Peter.

748
01:06:51,994 --> 01:06:58,138
[SPEAKER_58]: Um, Ellen Epstein, Nick Guerrero, Michael Dewberry.

749
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:01,680
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi.

750
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:11,633
[SPEAKER_43]: Good evening, Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road.

751
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:21,260
[SPEAKER_43]: So obviously very happy that we're revisiting, you know, changing our zoning comprehensively, but I do have to count myself among those who think this process is moving too fast.

752
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:24,382
[SPEAKER_43]: And it's not because we're, you know, not spending a lot of time.

753
01:07:25,183 --> 01:07:31,851
[SPEAKER_43]: you know, with various meetings, but this is just monumental changes, you know, inherently, they should be a slow process, it should be a slow process.

754
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:34,174
[SPEAKER_43]: I know you didn't want to hear general comments about speed.

755
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:37,418
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'll just discuss one thing in my short period of time here.

756
01:07:38,199 --> 01:07:44,307
[SPEAKER_43]: I think my biggest concern, and it's been expressed by so many others, and it was expressed in part, I think, by the DPW, Commissioner Tite,

757
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,129
[SPEAKER_43]: is just the impact on services, right?

758
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:50,552
[SPEAKER_43]: Schools, DPW, fire, EMS, police.

759
01:07:50,752 --> 01:07:55,295
[SPEAKER_43]: And as we heard from the DPW commissioner, you know, he can only really speak generally on the impact.

760
01:07:55,335 --> 01:07:56,596
[SPEAKER_43]: He doesn't have any information.

761
01:07:57,557 --> 01:08:12,888
[SPEAKER_43]: So that's why I think there'd really be benefit in getting studies done here that really give specifics on if population increases, you know, forecasting what that would have in terms of strain on our essential city services.

762
01:08:12,908 --> 01:08:13,309
[SPEAKER_43]: So really,

763
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,950
[SPEAKER_43]: That, I think, is the most compelling argument for slowing things down.

764
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:18,450
[SPEAKER_43]: So I strongly support that.

765
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:27,653
[SPEAKER_43]: And I would just urge, I guess, finally here, all of you to really take your time with this and try to avoid political pressure from the council to rush forward recommendations.

766
01:08:28,253 --> 01:08:36,175
[SPEAKER_43]: Because of just the drastic impact of these changes, it's super important that you take your time and try to do this in as scientific a way as possible.

767
01:08:36,815 --> 01:08:37,115
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

768
01:08:39,096 --> 01:08:39,576
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Nick.

769
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:42,777
[SPEAKER_58]: Gaston Fiore?

770
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:44,291
[SPEAKER_58]: David McKenna.

771
01:08:48,174 --> 01:08:49,415
[SPEAKER_58]: We're switching over to Zoom.

772
01:08:50,676 --> 01:08:52,477
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm gonna give a 30 second beep.

773
01:08:52,957 --> 01:08:57,181
[SPEAKER_41]: So after a minute and 30 seconds, it'll beep and then there'll be a second beep at 30 seconds.

774
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:58,341
[SPEAKER_41]: So people get a warning.

775
01:08:58,361 --> 01:09:02,585
[SPEAKER_58]: And we just ask that you like wrap up your thought, you know, when that two minutes hit.

776
01:09:03,508 --> 01:09:05,088
[SPEAKER_23]: Gaston Fiore 61, Stigny Road.

777
01:09:06,049 --> 01:09:14,231
[SPEAKER_23]: Research shows that adding homes can temper prices, but higher density can also cut privacy, raise noise, squeeze parking, and strain streets.

778
01:09:14,831 --> 01:09:16,991
[SPEAKER_23]: These burdens fall on current residents.

779
01:09:17,451 --> 01:09:20,652
[SPEAKER_23]: Our task is to capture the benefits while fully accounting for the costs.

780
01:09:21,152 --> 01:09:23,413
[SPEAKER_23]: First, acknowledge these externalities.

781
01:09:24,253 --> 01:09:26,434
[SPEAKER_23]: higher density cuts privacy and raises noise.

782
01:09:26,854 --> 01:09:29,856
[SPEAKER_23]: Many of us left condos to escape sleepless nights.

783
01:09:30,456 --> 01:09:31,577
[SPEAKER_23]: It also brings more cars.

784
01:09:32,217 --> 01:09:38,021
[SPEAKER_23]: Without off-street parking, those vehicles will crowd public streets and erase the curbside access we rely on.

785
01:09:38,601 --> 01:09:44,204
[SPEAKER_23]: Please settle parking and transit strategies before voting on any zoning overhaul.

786
01:09:44,784 --> 01:09:47,066
[SPEAKER_23]: Second, shrink regulatory costs.

787
01:09:47,606 --> 01:09:52,509
[SPEAKER_23]: Government rules make up about 40%, that's four zero percent,

788
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,010
[SPEAKER_23]: of multifamily development costs.

789
01:09:55,531 --> 01:09:57,972
[SPEAKER_23]: Permit delays and layered fees inflate prices.

790
01:09:58,513 --> 01:10:02,996
[SPEAKER_23]: Streamlined approvals and consolidated inspections cut costs before construction begins.

791
01:10:03,737 --> 01:10:06,318
[SPEAKER_23]: Third, let growth pay its own way.

792
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:15,685
[SPEAKER_23]: Projects that exceed current zoning or any future buy-write limits should fund the added load on roads, water, sewers, and schools.

793
01:10:16,085 --> 01:10:18,487
[SPEAKER_23]: Homeowners should see no new taxes.

794
01:10:18,967 --> 01:10:21,930
[SPEAKER_23]: If impacts are measured, offer property tax credits.

795
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:28,474
[SPEAKER_23]: housing affordability and neighborhood livability can coexist, but only if we confront these costs.

796
01:10:29,135 --> 01:10:39,463
[SPEAKER_23]: By pruning red tape, assigning infrastructure costs to growth, and safeguarding privacy and parking, Medford can welcome new neighbors while honoring those already here.

797
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:43,546
[SPEAKER_23]: As Thomas Sowell reminds us, there are no solutions, only trade-offs.

798
01:10:43,966 --> 01:10:50,411
[SPEAKER_23]: Let us choose the trade-off that adds homes without sacrificing the quiet nights and curb spaces residents have earned.

799
01:10:50,471 --> 01:10:50,791
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

800
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,041
[SPEAKER_58]: We're gonna move over to Stephen Pompeo.

801
01:10:58,061 --> 01:11:05,285
[SPEAKER_59]: Is Stephen on Zoom?

802
01:11:05,505 --> 01:11:06,606
[SPEAKER_59]: Okay.

803
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:11,429
[SPEAKER_58]: Stephen, are you on Zoom?

804
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:15,531
[SPEAKER_58]: Can you raise your hand if you are?

805
01:11:15,551 --> 01:11:24,876
[SPEAKER_58]: All right, we're gonna go back to in-person, but we will come back to Stephen if he's ready.

806
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:41,490
[SPEAKER_58]: uh jean nuzzo heather champagny chris lavoie i picked i picked it up most people don't get that okay

807
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:44,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, my name is Heather Champney.

808
01:11:44,315 --> 01:11:45,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm from 102 Brook Street.

809
01:11:46,295 --> 01:11:47,916
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I support affordable housing.

810
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:56,819
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm familiar with the Klein-Thompson book, Abundance, and I'm fully aware of how we liberals in our attempts to do right have increased regulation and expense for among other things, the cost of housing.

811
01:11:57,399 --> 01:11:59,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I just do not support this plan for the following reasons.

812
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Transparency, not every resident has been informed of what it means for them.

813
01:12:04,241 --> 01:12:05,641
[SPEAKER_09]: No hard data, for example.

814
01:12:05,681 --> 01:12:08,242
[SPEAKER_09]: How many affordable units have been built in the last 10 years?

815
01:12:08,622 --> 01:12:09,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Price points of new housing.

816
01:12:10,523 --> 01:12:21,827
[SPEAKER_09]: private developers role, infrastructure concerns, which we've already heard about tonight, more money, more money, more money, little recognition of what will be lost and no indication of any plans to protect.

817
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:29,770
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no revenue plan provided, which assures that the extensive infrastructure needs, including school overcrowding and new high school will be corrected.

818
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:41,976
[SPEAKER_09]: The trickle down approach of building more expensive housing, which then reduces prices for the most financially able and then trickles down to those with slimmer purses has not been proven as effective.

819
01:12:42,356 --> 01:12:47,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I have lived through the Reagan failed trickle down approach and I'm seeing the mess we are all in now.

820
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:55,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I am reluctant in the recent words of one city Councilor to a resident concerned about current, let alone future infrastructure stressors.

821
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:56,863
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll worry about that later.

822
01:12:57,303 --> 01:13:01,344
[SPEAKER_09]: This sort of planning or lack of it, I fear, is what we see now coming at us from Washington.

823
01:13:01,684 --> 01:13:05,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I like hard data, and what I have found in the research does not support this proposal.

824
01:13:08,606 --> 01:13:12,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I plan to finish it, just to let you know, because I've already had to cut out half of it.

825
01:13:15,048 --> 01:13:23,471
[SPEAKER_09]: My biggest concern is that until every resident is notified as to what the proposed zoning actually means for them, this is not a transparent exercise.

826
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:26,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand you're under pressure from the council, and I understand why.

827
01:13:27,855 --> 01:13:37,821
[SPEAKER_09]: The current push to put this proposal before the council before the next election feels like bullying or at best represents the perspective of one well-organized group of citizens within the town.

828
01:13:38,361 --> 01:13:40,443
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a my way or highway feel about it.

829
01:13:40,763 --> 01:13:43,865
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not how my reading of abundance purports to proceed.

830
01:13:44,385 --> 01:13:52,050
[SPEAKER_09]: It increases reactionary responses rather than brings together the best of all experts, technical engineering, government, and the neighbors from the start.

831
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:55,813
[SPEAKER_09]: This proposal is a boon to developers and large real estate brokers.

832
01:13:56,173 --> 01:13:58,995
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not a guarantee of housing for those who most need it.

833
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:04,520
[SPEAKER_09]: It is at the expense of every neighborhood in the community, not just West Medford.

834
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:11,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I prefer to feel that this is unintentional, but this plan establishes divisive rather than cooperative solutions.

835
01:14:14,187 --> 01:14:14,808
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you, Heather.

836
01:14:15,128 --> 01:14:15,308
[SPEAKER_57]: Chris?

837
01:14:21,764 --> 01:14:22,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

838
01:14:22,204 --> 01:14:24,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris Lavoie, 101 Century Street Extension.

839
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:40,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Current zoning proposals are, at best, ill-conceived, if not outright reckless, and I strongly encourage the board and our elected officials to reject them in their entirety until a comprehensive study is completed, along with broader input from the citizen stakeholders of our community.

840
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:53,289
[SPEAKER_04]: At its foundation, the proposed zoning changes lack any concrete risk-benefit analysis for one to contemplate such an undertaking with such profound investment of community resources and impact to our quality of life.

841
01:14:54,070 --> 01:15:00,416
[SPEAKER_04]: An off-sited goal of the residential proposal, and one which was publicly acknowledged by this Board,

842
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:06,200
[SPEAKER_04]: is the need to increase housing density in order to address a perceived housing crisis.

843
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:09,123
[SPEAKER_04]: To be clear, there is no housing crisis.

844
01:15:09,223 --> 01:15:11,485
[SPEAKER_04]: The entirety of the Massachusetts population...

845
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:16,125
[SPEAKER_04]: has grown by 7.4 percent from 2010 to 2020.

846
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:21,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Housing unit growth during that same period grew by 7.9 percent.

847
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:31,035
[SPEAKER_04]: As responsible citizens, we have a duty to be immediately skeptical the moment an elected official attaches the word crisis to anything.

848
01:15:31,556 --> 01:15:32,737
[SPEAKER_04]: What Medford has

849
01:15:33,934 --> 01:15:37,175
[SPEAKER_04]: is the good fortune of a moment of desirability.

850
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:39,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps we have a desirability crisis.

851
01:15:40,137 --> 01:15:47,620
[SPEAKER_04]: It compounded by a lack of turnover due entirely to macroeconomic influences, namely interest rates and inflation.

852
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:55,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Increasing residential density will not impact the affordability of housing if one can even define what that is.

853
01:15:55,963 --> 01:15:59,885
[SPEAKER_04]: One need only look as far as Cambridge and Somerville to understand what I mean.

854
01:16:00,545 --> 01:16:10,913
[SPEAKER_04]: While increased density may indeed increase our revenue base, the demand for resources and infrastructure, school capacity and municipal services will scale in unison.

855
01:16:11,373 --> 01:16:17,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Residential zoning increases and density are a zero-sum game from a revenue perspective, as they should be.

856
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:25,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, as evidenced by the sudden outpouring of concern, it is clear that the citizens of Medford are largely uninformed.

857
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,507
[SPEAKER_04]: so much so that one has to wonder if it is not by design.

858
01:16:29,988 --> 01:16:34,312
[SPEAKER_04]: After all, every system is designed to get the results that it achieves.

859
01:16:34,332 --> 01:16:39,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we have an uninformed public, which is a failure of our elected officials.

860
01:16:40,056 --> 01:16:52,427
[SPEAKER_04]: To move forward responsibly, I would ask again that the CDB and our elected body reject these proposed changes until a more comprehensive study can be done and we move forward in a more incremental and measured way.

861
01:16:52,447 --> 01:16:53,368
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Chris.

862
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:01,194
[SPEAKER_57]: We're going to go over to Steven Pompeo on Zoom.

863
01:17:04,656 --> 01:17:09,859
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go over to Steven Pompeo on Zoom.

864
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you very much.

865
01:17:14,142 --> 01:17:27,930
[SPEAKER_07]: So to get right to the point, I'd like to encourage the board at this point to take the opportunity to adjourn at some point tonight, the public hearing on the neighborhood topic.

866
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:34,182
[SPEAKER_07]: and to make the recommendation to the city council that it adjourns it as well.

867
01:17:35,663 --> 01:17:49,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And then take up discussion of some helpful density creating options like the ADUs and possibly special permit incentives for developing a smaller or split lots.

868
01:17:50,353 --> 01:17:57,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But the idea of this taking a single family neighborhood and converting it into multi families,

869
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:07,166
[SPEAKER_07]: might help a few people who have lucky lots, might help some developers, and may not change the neighborhood immediately.

870
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:18,735
[SPEAKER_07]: But the first three, six-unit house building that goes next to somebody else's home is the day that their property plummets in value, all the abutters

871
01:18:19,275 --> 01:18:21,337
[SPEAKER_07]: around one of those properties will plummet in value.

872
01:18:21,777 --> 01:18:24,299
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are just regular people in the city of Medford.

873
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Their homes are everything they have.

874
01:18:27,362 --> 01:18:32,366
[SPEAKER_07]: If the value of their home is dropped, then they are limited to what they can do in retirement.

875
01:18:32,427 --> 01:18:37,011
[SPEAKER_07]: They may need their home's value for assisted living.

876
01:18:37,051 --> 01:18:39,753
[SPEAKER_07]: They may need it to help children or grandchildren go to college.

877
01:18:40,268 --> 01:18:51,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So on a micro level, the moment we start putting multi-units next to people's property is the moment that that poor individual's property starts to plummet in value.

878
01:18:51,977 --> 01:19:05,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I would just encourage the board to continue with the ADUs and maybe consider something about affordable housing on undeveloped lots, but otherwise to adjourn the public hearing once and for all.

879
01:19:05,967 --> 01:19:06,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

880
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:10,839
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Steven.

881
01:19:17,644 --> 01:19:21,247
[SPEAKER_58]: Our next two Zoom commenters are Roberta Cameron and Denise Martinez.

882
01:19:22,568 --> 01:19:29,373
[SPEAKER_58]: Roberta and Denise, would you please raise your hands in Zoom so we can confirm?

883
01:19:29,893 --> 01:19:30,634
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, Roberta.

884
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,936
[SPEAKER_58]: Roberta, we're gonna go ahead and unmute you and start the timer.

885
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:39,501
[SPEAKER_31]: Roberta, are you there?

886
01:19:40,137 --> 01:19:41,097
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, I'm here.

887
01:19:41,117 --> 01:19:43,038
[SPEAKER_31]: Can you hear me?

888
01:19:43,358 --> 01:19:43,718
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

889
01:19:43,898 --> 01:19:44,598
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you so much.

890
01:19:44,898 --> 01:20:07,683
[SPEAKER_31]: I wasn't anticipating, actually, that you were going to call my name, but I am happy to just make a quick response to a previous comment in that when a homeowner's property is upzoned, meaning that they are allowed to build another amount of development above what they currently have, that

891
01:20:08,358 --> 01:20:11,839
[SPEAKER_31]: increases their property value, that doesn't lower their property value.

892
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:19,680
[SPEAKER_31]: So upzoning is going to increase people's property value.

893
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:32,942
[SPEAKER_31]: And I also wanted to note what was said earlier this evening, that new growth is really going to help us to pay for the infrastructure improvements that we already need.

894
01:20:33,722 --> 01:20:35,843
[SPEAKER_31]: And so it's really critical that we

895
01:20:37,243 --> 01:20:46,565
[SPEAKER_31]: facilitate new growth by allowing more development than what our current zoning allows.

896
01:20:47,065 --> 01:20:47,365
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

897
01:20:47,405 --> 01:20:48,805
[SPEAKER_31]: That's all that I'm going to say this evening.

898
01:20:50,205 --> 01:20:50,906
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Roberta.

899
01:20:51,006 --> 01:20:53,286
[SPEAKER_58]: Our next Zoom commenter is Denise Martinez.

900
01:20:55,246 --> 01:20:58,867
[SPEAKER_58]: And while I do appreciate the applause, let's try to keep our feedback positive.

901
01:20:59,687 --> 01:21:03,228
[SPEAKER_58]: We're trying to show everybody the same respect that we would want to receive ourselves.

902
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:03,988
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

903
01:21:05,752 --> 01:21:06,533
[SPEAKER_58]: Denise Martinez.

904
01:21:06,553 --> 01:21:08,074
[SPEAKER_58]: I see you, Denise.

905
01:21:08,274 --> 01:21:09,095
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to unmute you.

906
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:12,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, good evening.

907
01:21:12,478 --> 01:21:15,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for allowing me to present tonight to actually speak.

908
01:21:17,143 --> 01:21:21,327
[SPEAKER_16]: I am a new homeowner in Medford, and I purchased my home a couple of years ago.

909
01:21:21,347 --> 01:21:24,009
[SPEAKER_16]: I lived in the Tufts area for many years.

910
01:21:25,271 --> 01:21:28,814
[SPEAKER_16]: I am opposed to the rush that you are doing

911
01:21:30,095 --> 01:21:34,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Over in the Tufts area, there is a density of parking.

912
01:21:34,216 --> 01:21:35,516
[SPEAKER_16]: There is almost no parking.

913
01:21:36,276 --> 01:21:41,558
[SPEAKER_16]: When the plows come down in the middle of the snowstorms, they can barely make it down the street.

914
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:45,178
[SPEAKER_16]: And people argue over their parking spots.

915
01:21:45,338 --> 01:21:47,659
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not South Boston that we should be living in.

916
01:21:47,719 --> 01:21:49,459
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not living in the city of Boston.

917
01:21:49,539 --> 01:21:50,260
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Medford.

918
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:54,120
[SPEAKER_16]: And I understand that affordable housing is a crisis.

919
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,821
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think the rush to do the zoning

920
01:21:57,261 --> 01:21:59,204
[SPEAKER_16]: is going to create affordable housing.

921
01:21:59,224 --> 01:22:04,532
[SPEAKER_16]: It's actually going to hurt because people are going to sell their homes because they're going to cash out.

922
01:22:05,013 --> 01:22:11,924
[SPEAKER_16]: And then it's just going to leave us, the people who are living here, to deal with the parking, to deal... We don't know how the sewer's going to...

923
01:22:12,905 --> 01:22:33,758
[SPEAKER_16]: React we don't know how if the city can fix all of the potholes that it currently has I just learned tonight that the city is responsible for potholes McCall Street has a ton of potholes They've been the city has been saying that they're not responsible for that So there's kind of mixed messages from the city and I think we all need to come together and slow down I agree with the mayor 100% and

924
01:22:35,139 --> 01:22:38,001
[SPEAKER_16]: and the other council members that I am uncomfortable with this.

925
01:22:38,782 --> 01:22:41,044
[SPEAKER_16]: I support affordable housing.

926
01:22:41,124 --> 01:22:43,446
[SPEAKER_16]: I support new people coming into the city.

927
01:22:43,466 --> 01:22:44,827
[SPEAKER_16]: I support the schools.

928
01:22:45,768 --> 01:22:47,129
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't support the rush.

929
01:22:47,289 --> 01:22:48,990
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think, yes, thank you.

930
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:53,834
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we just need to slow down and be more intentional and look at the costs for everyone.

931
01:22:54,915 --> 01:22:55,335
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

932
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:56,716
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Denise.

933
01:22:58,257 --> 01:22:59,779
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going back to in-person comment.

934
01:22:59,919 --> 01:23:03,582
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Nate Merritt, Olga Okedi,

935
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:06,037
[SPEAKER_58]: Uh, Micah Kesselman.

936
01:23:06,057 --> 01:23:10,879
[SPEAKER_58]: Uh, sure.

937
01:23:17,002 --> 01:23:21,184
[SPEAKER_41]: Just remember that the board members on Zoom may not be able to see you.

938
01:23:21,224 --> 01:23:24,645
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm not sure if they can zoom in on you for the cameras.

939
01:23:24,705 --> 01:23:25,445
[SPEAKER_19]: There we go.

940
01:23:25,546 --> 01:23:25,826
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

941
01:23:25,866 --> 01:23:27,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

942
01:23:27,506 --> 01:23:29,467
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm down to two minutes instead of three from last time.

943
01:23:30,028 --> 01:23:30,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Um,

944
01:23:31,148 --> 01:23:35,210
[SPEAKER_19]: So I moved to Medford for single family house with my family.

945
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:35,990
[SPEAKER_19]: I have little kids.

946
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:38,171
[SPEAKER_19]: I know plenty of parents who want to do the same thing.

947
01:23:38,531 --> 01:23:45,574
[SPEAKER_19]: So when I hear city council members and other people saying that the days of single family housing is over, that's a travesty.

948
01:23:45,835 --> 01:23:47,855
[SPEAKER_19]: The city of Lowell has single family housing.

949
01:23:47,895 --> 01:23:49,436
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the third biggest city in the state.

950
01:23:49,496 --> 01:23:50,897
[SPEAKER_19]: So why is Medford so special?

951
01:23:52,438 --> 01:24:00,485
[SPEAKER_19]: That said, it's also a travesty that in the last meeting, Director Hunt actually tried to suppress public comments here so you people couldn't be heard.

952
01:24:00,545 --> 01:24:03,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Instead, the idea was floated or just send it an email.

953
01:24:03,668 --> 01:24:10,213
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of questions that haven't been communicated back, so I'm really glad that you all decided to have in-person comments.

954
01:24:10,553 --> 01:24:11,795
[SPEAKER_19]: The maps here are confusing.

955
01:24:12,475 --> 01:24:13,336
[SPEAKER_19]: This map shows

956
01:24:14,777 --> 01:24:19,321
[SPEAKER_19]: not what is today, but I think people think this might be today's zoning and that's not.

957
01:24:19,882 --> 01:24:24,385
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the plan that the City Council wants versus what the CDB wants.

958
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:30,571
[SPEAKER_19]: You're missing the one that is today so people can actually compare and contrast what is existing today before any plan.

959
01:24:30,631 --> 01:24:31,712
[SPEAKER_19]: So some clarity could help.

960
01:24:32,852 --> 01:24:34,313
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see Lumiere Apartments.

961
01:24:34,393 --> 01:24:35,593
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see Station Landing.

962
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:39,454
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see any color coding where we know there are already big complexes.

963
01:24:39,514 --> 01:24:46,516
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see anything on this map that says where there's a high rise that Director McGivern was talking about where it might be a concern.

964
01:24:46,876 --> 01:24:49,336
[SPEAKER_19]: I look on this table here, same thing.

965
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,377
[SPEAKER_19]: The max is only three stories.

966
01:24:51,417 --> 01:24:53,898
[SPEAKER_19]: There's nothing here that says anything above three stories.

967
01:24:54,198 --> 01:24:55,758
[SPEAKER_19]: So what color is it on the maps?

968
01:24:55,778 --> 01:24:57,779
[SPEAKER_19]: This needs to be communicated better to the people.

969
01:25:00,005 --> 01:25:02,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, commercial mixed use, right?

970
01:25:02,906 --> 01:25:03,866
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the promise.

971
01:25:04,126 --> 01:25:05,747
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe that's what's missing from there.

972
01:25:05,847 --> 01:25:06,387
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

973
01:25:06,827 --> 01:25:10,029
[SPEAKER_19]: You have a large building on Middlesex where H Mart was supposed to go.

974
01:25:10,529 --> 01:25:13,690
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe there's some other problems in this city where businesses can't get it.

975
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:15,430
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going to have brand new buildings.

976
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:18,451
[SPEAKER_19]: What company is going to go in there if they can't get in for two years?

977
01:25:18,612 --> 01:25:22,993
[SPEAKER_19]: H Mart pulled out and instead they got in and out of Davis sooner than they could in Medford.

978
01:25:23,573 --> 01:25:24,594
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's all I got.

979
01:25:24,754 --> 01:25:25,014
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

980
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:27,996
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you, Nate.

981
01:25:31,402 --> 01:25:32,825
[SPEAKER_58]: We're Olga and Micah here.

982
01:25:32,845 --> 01:25:35,229
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay.

983
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:37,834
[SPEAKER_58]: Carolyn Frey, Meryl Perlson.

984
01:25:49,528 --> 01:25:53,050
[SPEAKER_58]: And then we're moving into people that have signed up fresh for today.

985
01:25:53,871 --> 01:25:58,635
[SPEAKER_58]: Ralph Klein, I'm going to call three at a time, just so people kind of like get in their minds that they're coming up.

986
01:25:59,435 --> 01:26:03,638
[SPEAKER_58]: And then we're going to go back to zoom for a couple and kind of keep going back and forth.

987
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:09,603
[SPEAKER_58]: But I am trying to prioritize the people in person recognizing that your body and mind is here.

988
01:26:11,204 --> 01:26:16,488
[SPEAKER_58]: So we have Ralph Klein, Mary Pierre Adzigian, and

989
01:26:17,347 --> 01:26:18,528
[SPEAKER_58]: Dina Colegio.

990
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:22,531
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi.

991
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:23,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

992
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:26,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Ralph Klein, 172 Park Street, Medford.

993
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:30,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I also have interest in property in West Medford on High Street.

994
01:26:31,598 --> 01:26:33,039
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm against these proposals.

995
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,241
[SPEAKER_14]: They lack planning.

996
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:39,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Salem Street hasn't been surveyed in 30 years.

997
01:26:40,085 --> 01:26:43,708
[SPEAKER_14]: They put that 30 or 60 years, since the 1930s.

998
01:26:43,728 --> 01:26:43,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Also,

999
01:26:47,187 --> 01:26:49,208
[SPEAKER_14]: The Sink Building, they put it on Salem Street.

1000
01:26:50,489 --> 01:26:51,590
[SPEAKER_14]: The zoning was horrible.

1001
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:53,131
[SPEAKER_14]: They took away parking.

1002
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:56,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Now everybody says, oh, it doesn't affect you, the parking at Salem Street.

1003
01:26:57,734 --> 01:26:59,795
[SPEAKER_14]: I live on Park Street, a block away from the building.

1004
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:07,840
[SPEAKER_14]: All the businesses from the Potter Building, JRA Cycles, and the overflow from their building park on Park Street.

1005
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:09,801
[SPEAKER_14]: All the employees park down there.

1006
01:27:09,961 --> 01:27:13,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Drive down Park Street, you see every bicycle rack on every single car.

1007
01:27:14,607 --> 01:27:19,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to make a proposal to the city for resident parking only on Park Street.

1008
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:27,289
[SPEAKER_14]: This is one single building that caused this problem a block away and even closer.

1009
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:33,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I always got the message from Sergeant Barry Clemente when they have these meetings, the informational meetings.

1010
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:35,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I got the first one yesterday.

1011
01:27:36,885 --> 01:27:37,745
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't gotten one.

1012
01:27:38,205 --> 01:27:41,468
[SPEAKER_14]: The proposal for the bike lane going down Park Street, never heard about it.

1013
01:27:41,768 --> 01:27:46,791
[SPEAKER_14]: The only reason why I knew about it is because I saw Todd Blake walking down the street putting measurements out.

1014
01:27:47,792 --> 01:27:49,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Park Street should not be a bike lane.

1015
01:27:49,693 --> 01:27:50,494
[SPEAKER_14]: You voted it in.

1016
01:27:50,954 --> 01:27:55,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Not one resident of Park Street between Park and Central

1017
01:27:56,205 --> 01:27:56,965
[SPEAKER_14]: It was voted on.

1018
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:57,885
[SPEAKER_58]: 30 seconds.

1019
01:27:59,166 --> 01:28:02,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, there was water issues where they put the condo in on Park Street at 169.

1020
01:28:02,987 --> 01:28:06,087
[SPEAKER_14]: There were water pressure issues, too much pressure.

1021
01:28:07,428 --> 01:28:11,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, the solar system, solar, you want it green?

1022
01:28:11,409 --> 01:28:12,249
[SPEAKER_14]: You put up a building.

1023
01:28:13,109 --> 01:28:16,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Salem Street, Route 60 is an east-west route.

1024
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:19,991
[SPEAKER_14]: You put up a building on the right side that's six stories tall and a three-story building.

1025
01:28:20,371 --> 01:28:23,812
[SPEAKER_14]: He loses his ability to put solar on his home, lowering his value.

1026
01:28:25,068 --> 01:28:30,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, the person who stated that if you put a building next door, it lowers your property value.

1027
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:33,271
[SPEAKER_14]: She said, oh, well, you can sell your unit.

1028
01:28:34,311 --> 01:28:35,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are you gonna sell your house?

1029
01:28:35,652 --> 01:28:36,612
[SPEAKER_14]: It raises your value.

1030
01:28:36,632 --> 01:28:38,913
[SPEAKER_14]: She's talking about two different things.

1031
01:28:39,353 --> 01:28:46,055
[SPEAKER_14]: She's comparing apples to oranges, and this council has to stop this crap that you're trying to run down our throats in one year.

1032
01:28:46,595 --> 01:28:47,495
[SPEAKER_14]: How many years has it been?

1033
01:28:47,515 --> 01:28:48,856
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Ralph.

1034
01:28:52,608 --> 01:28:56,611
[SPEAKER_58]: And just to clarify, this is the Community Development Board, not the City Council.

1035
01:28:57,652 --> 01:29:04,737
[SPEAKER_58]: So some of those comments you may want to reiterate to the Council as well, but they are noted here in our public comments.

1036
01:29:04,757 --> 01:29:05,458
[SPEAKER_58]: So thank you for that.

1037
01:29:07,559 --> 01:29:07,819
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi.

1038
01:29:07,959 --> 01:29:08,240
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi.

1039
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,082
[SPEAKER_55]: I am Mary Pierced-Zigian.

1040
01:29:11,342 --> 01:29:15,205
[SPEAKER_55]: I live at 74 Sturgis Street in Fulton Heights.

1041
01:29:16,621 --> 01:29:20,842
[SPEAKER_55]: I am concerned with the changes to the residential zoning.

1042
01:29:22,722 --> 01:29:27,583
[SPEAKER_55]: I don't understand why the changes are being made.

1043
01:29:28,844 --> 01:29:36,845
[SPEAKER_55]: My husband and I moved to Medford to live in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood with a lot of green space.

1044
01:29:38,866 --> 01:29:39,966
[SPEAKER_55]: The changes will

1045
01:29:41,468 --> 01:29:49,531
[SPEAKER_55]: that are proposed, I believe, will directly affect us because my neighbor has a very large lot and a very small house.

1046
01:29:52,212 --> 01:29:59,135
[SPEAKER_55]: I believe that the setback changes are not good for residential neighborhoods.

1047
01:29:59,815 --> 01:30:04,297
[SPEAKER_55]: Five foot setbacks are too small.

1048
01:30:07,763 --> 01:30:09,744
[SPEAKER_58]: do you have a suggestion for what they should be?

1049
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:11,445
[SPEAKER_58]: The other, excuse me?

1050
01:30:11,465 --> 01:30:13,066
[SPEAKER_58]: Do you have a suggestion for what they should be?

1051
01:30:13,306 --> 01:30:17,468
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, I was one of the gentlemen who said, what are they now?

1052
01:30:18,088 --> 01:30:21,370
[SPEAKER_55]: It would be helpful for the public to actually see what are they.

1053
01:30:25,632 --> 01:30:31,655
[SPEAKER_55]: And the other thing is, yeah, just.

1054
01:30:31,675 --> 01:30:34,317
[SPEAKER_45]: Seven and a half side, but it's a two and a half story house.

1055
01:30:36,915 --> 01:30:37,135
[SPEAKER_55]: right?

1056
01:30:37,255 --> 01:30:44,438
[SPEAKER_55]: I think that I think it would be really helpful for the public to actually compare what we have to what's proposed.

1057
01:30:45,659 --> 01:30:56,263
[SPEAKER_55]: Um, because I read through the comprehensive zoning, and I only got 30 seconds last month, and a lot of my neighbors who I've talked to in my neighborhood are older.

1058
01:30:56,503 --> 01:30:58,324
[SPEAKER_55]: They don't get texts from the city.

1059
01:30:58,884 --> 01:31:00,705
[SPEAKER_55]: They have no idea this is going on.

1060
01:31:01,565 --> 01:31:07,510
[SPEAKER_55]: So it would be really helpful to have more information so that we can actually see what's going to happen.

1061
01:31:09,071 --> 01:31:17,817
[SPEAKER_55]: And finally, the last thing I would say, a purchase of a house is one of the most major life decisions that we can make.

1062
01:31:18,198 --> 01:31:27,565
[SPEAKER_55]: People save for many years to buy their house, and people have a right to rely on the zoning changes not changing drastically.

1063
01:31:28,895 --> 01:31:31,456
[SPEAKER_55]: the zoning regulations not changing drastically.

1064
01:31:31,476 --> 01:31:32,576
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1065
01:31:32,596 --> 01:31:33,177
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Mary.

1066
01:31:37,098 --> 01:31:38,879
[SPEAKER_57]: We have Dina Calegero.

1067
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:40,860
[SPEAKER_52]: Hi, Dina.

1068
01:31:43,701 --> 01:31:44,461
[SPEAKER_52]: Sure.

1069
01:31:44,521 --> 01:31:46,001
[SPEAKER_52]: Last name is Calegero.

1070
01:31:46,022 --> 01:31:47,262
[SPEAKER_52]: Calegero is close enough.

1071
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:48,642
[SPEAKER_52]: I live in Stanley Avenue.

1072
01:31:49,803 --> 01:31:51,183
[SPEAKER_52]: I've lived on the street for over 60 years.

1073
01:31:53,057 --> 01:31:55,701
[SPEAKER_52]: And I'm the butter to Tufts University.

1074
01:31:56,401 --> 01:32:00,767
[SPEAKER_52]: And I bring really deeply rooted perspective on the unique challenges we have.

1075
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:02,950
[SPEAKER_52]: as an abutter of the university.

1076
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:11,553
[SPEAKER_52]: As a South Method resident, I've witnessed firsthand the impact of inadequate housing that Tufts has.

1077
01:32:11,653 --> 01:32:16,134
[SPEAKER_52]: Currently, they only house guaranteed housing for freshmen and sophomores.

1078
01:32:16,854 --> 01:32:24,977
[SPEAKER_52]: And what happens is that the developers come in, they take the houses, they flip them, and they rent them to Tufts University students.

1079
01:32:25,677 --> 01:32:29,558
[SPEAKER_52]: Nearly all the multifamily homes in my street were redeveloped.

1080
01:32:30,998 --> 01:32:36,302
[SPEAKER_52]: and are now converted for tough students, not affordable housing.

1081
01:32:36,742 --> 01:32:37,782
[SPEAKER_52]: They're very expensive.

1082
01:32:38,863 --> 01:32:47,028
[SPEAKER_52]: The newly developed apartments and housing is initially maintained very well, but then the properties decline.

1083
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:50,210
[SPEAKER_52]: The students are transient.

1084
01:32:50,651 --> 01:32:52,972
[SPEAKER_52]: They're not part of a fabric of our neighborhood.

1085
01:32:54,113 --> 01:32:58,736
[SPEAKER_52]: The dynamic has led to several persistent problems in the area, parking,

1086
01:32:59,422 --> 01:33:02,666
[SPEAKER_52]: overflowing trash, noise, and rodent activities.

1087
01:33:03,266 --> 01:33:07,331
[SPEAKER_52]: And these conditions have really eroded the neighborhood in which I've lived in.

1088
01:33:08,111 --> 01:33:16,080
[SPEAKER_52]: This looks a lot like what the residential zoning will do in our neighborhood, which on my street is residential one, which is scary.

1089
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:22,964
[SPEAKER_52]: You know, I really commend Nedford for the forward thinking of changing zoning, it's needed.

1090
01:33:23,944 --> 01:33:29,748
[SPEAKER_52]: But I only support those efforts if they are implemented slowly and carefully.

1091
01:33:29,848 --> 01:33:34,972
[SPEAKER_52]: I agree with the mayor and I agree with the residents of Medford that we are moving much, much too slow.

1092
01:33:34,992 --> 01:33:38,294
[SPEAKER_52]: And I think it's important that we really protect

1093
01:33:38,874 --> 01:33:43,756
[SPEAKER_52]: and cherish the character and the design of the places we live.

1094
01:33:44,256 --> 01:33:45,476
[SPEAKER_52]: They're our homes.

1095
01:33:45,996 --> 01:33:50,838
[SPEAKER_52]: They have so much value to us and what we need and what we want.

1096
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:53,518
[SPEAKER_52]: And moving in this way is far too quick.

1097
01:33:54,059 --> 01:33:54,899
[SPEAKER_52]: Slow down.

1098
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:56,960
[SPEAKER_52]: Let's start with ADUs.

1099
01:33:57,220 --> 01:34:00,601
[SPEAKER_52]: Let's consider the infrastructure changes and move slowly.

1100
01:34:00,621 --> 01:34:07,183
[SPEAKER_52]: I will see more of the same type of development that has occurred in my area with Tufts University.

1101
01:34:07,563 --> 01:34:08,103
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you, Dina.

1102
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:11,889
[SPEAKER_44]: We're going to go back to our Zoom commenter.

1103
01:34:12,009 --> 01:34:13,671
[SPEAKER_44]: We have Meryl Pearlson.

1104
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:21,096
[SPEAKER_67]: Hi, thank you.

1105
01:34:21,116 --> 01:34:22,077
[SPEAKER_67]: Hi.

1106
01:34:23,299 --> 01:34:27,443
[SPEAKER_67]: So I just want to say a few things.

1107
01:34:27,503 --> 01:34:29,866
[SPEAKER_67]: I'm a resident of 97B Boston Avenue.

1108
01:34:30,026 --> 01:34:34,231
[SPEAKER_67]: I've lived in Medford for about 25 years, which I know still makes me a newbie.

1109
01:34:34,852 --> 01:34:40,859
[SPEAKER_67]: I own a condo there and I chose to live in Medford for many of the reasons people have said.

1110
01:34:41,739 --> 01:34:49,922
[SPEAKER_67]: to have that sort of access to the outdoors and trees while still having some proximity to urban areas.

1111
01:34:50,842 --> 01:34:57,184
[SPEAKER_67]: I chose to live on a busy street because that was what I could afford and that's what I can continue to afford.

1112
01:34:57,204 --> 01:35:01,445
[SPEAKER_67]: I really want to support these zoning changes.

1113
01:35:01,465 --> 01:35:07,127
[SPEAKER_67]: I agree we need more housing, more affordable housing, but I just can't based on what

1114
01:35:07,707 --> 01:35:10,713
[SPEAKER_67]: lack of information we have about some of the implications.

1115
01:35:11,314 --> 01:35:13,278
[SPEAKER_67]: I see this being driven more by

1116
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:22,013
[SPEAKER_67]: philosophies about policies that help growth as opposed to the specifics of our particular community.

1117
01:35:23,074 --> 01:35:25,955
[SPEAKER_67]: The public notification was completely insufficient.

1118
01:35:26,035 --> 01:35:32,239
[SPEAKER_67]: Another change that's going on in my neighborhood currently is development and improvements to the Mystic River area.

1119
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:36,821
[SPEAKER_67]: There were signs all over the neighborhood for six months with scan codes.

1120
01:35:36,841 --> 01:35:38,822
[SPEAKER_67]: You could not miss that that was happening.

1121
01:35:39,262 --> 01:35:41,564
[SPEAKER_67]: I have not seen one notice in the neighborhood.

1122
01:35:42,344 --> 01:35:50,309
[SPEAKER_67]: I also don't see why there can't be people coming into the neighborhoods that are affected to meet with people and physically notify folks.

1123
01:35:50,589 --> 01:35:51,950
[SPEAKER_67]: Not everybody is online.

1124
01:35:52,951 --> 01:36:04,378
[SPEAKER_67]: Secondly, I want to say that there's not enough walkability, all the things that are supposed to be making this possible, good public transit walkability.

1125
01:36:05,098 --> 01:36:10,719
[SPEAKER_67]: Try walking in my neighborhood or taking a wheelchair in my neighborhood to public transit or over to the river.

1126
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:14,020
[SPEAKER_67]: You have to be in the middle of the street to navigate sidewalks.

1127
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:19,381
[SPEAKER_67]: I live next door to unregulated renters who are crammed into a house illegally.

1128
01:36:19,822 --> 01:36:20,862
[SPEAKER_67]: They park on the street.

1129
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:24,263
[SPEAKER_67]: They don't observe just common sense.

1130
01:36:24,643 --> 01:36:32,805
[SPEAKER_67]: And I just wish and support the slowing down and the careful study of these changes because it's too important to just rush through.

1131
01:36:32,825 --> 01:36:34,325
[SPEAKER_67]: So thank you very much.

1132
01:36:36,088 --> 01:36:36,609
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Meryl.

1133
01:37:05,905 --> 01:37:06,525
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

1134
01:37:06,545 --> 01:37:09,006
[SPEAKER_58]: The next figure we have is Mike Master Boney.

1135
01:37:09,026 --> 01:37:12,287
[SPEAKER_58]: Um other upcoming speakers.

1136
01:37:12,527 --> 01:37:13,368
[SPEAKER_58]: Nancy Hogan.

1137
01:37:14,028 --> 01:37:15,088
[SPEAKER_58]: That might not be the last name.

1138
01:37:15,168 --> 01:37:16,108
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, because you've got it.

1139
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:16,369
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank

1140
01:37:24,569 --> 01:37:29,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board, Mike Mastrobone, 73 Fulton Spring Road.

1141
01:37:29,453 --> 01:37:39,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a parent, I'm also a municipal finance professional, and I strongly support the proposed zoning updates, primarily because they align with previously stated goals of our community.

1142
01:37:40,581 --> 01:37:51,150
[SPEAKER_03]: First, increasing density and mixed use projects near transit and squares means young families, downsizing seniors, and first-time homeowners, as examples, can have access to opportunities to live here in Medford.

1143
01:37:52,321 --> 01:37:55,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now in our schools, we have 62 McKinney-Vento students.

1144
01:37:55,364 --> 01:38:04,193
[SPEAKER_03]: These are neighbors that couldn't continue living here, and we pay to transport them back to Medford from where they're living now after becoming homeless.

1145
01:38:04,654 --> 01:38:06,716
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a symptom of housing affordability, in my opinion.

1146
01:38:06,896 --> 01:38:07,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Full stop.

1147
01:38:08,057 --> 01:38:13,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, like it or not, Proposition 2.5 in Massachusetts is a restrictive limit that we need to take very seriously.

1148
01:38:14,119 --> 01:38:16,819
[SPEAKER_03]: If Medford is not saying yes to investment, we are falling behind.

1149
01:38:17,339 --> 01:38:20,000
[SPEAKER_03]: We're falling behind in revenue to fund our basic city services.

1150
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:23,481
[SPEAKER_03]: We're falling behind in revenue to fund investments in infrastructure.

1151
01:38:24,221 --> 01:38:27,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also falling behind in our ability to fully fund our schools.

1152
01:38:28,022 --> 01:38:30,203
[SPEAKER_03]: These are non-negotiables as far as I'm concerned.

1153
01:38:30,978 --> 01:38:36,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Third, the amendments to zoning before you are essential to translate our comprehensive plan that already exists into reality.

1154
01:38:37,502 --> 01:38:43,345
[SPEAKER_03]: The action items from that plan are littered with recommendations made in the updated zoning that's before this board.

1155
01:38:44,105 --> 01:38:48,828
[SPEAKER_03]: To name a few, creating accessible 12 and 18 hour communities, ensuring affordable housing for all,

1156
01:38:49,468 --> 01:38:54,193
[SPEAKER_03]: and achieving our sustainability goals, as well as encouraging balanced growth.

1157
01:38:55,114 --> 01:38:58,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight I want to make it clear I support the recommendations made in the zoning reform package.

1158
01:38:59,418 --> 01:39:01,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I urge you to move forward at the time that you see fit.

1159
01:39:02,081 --> 01:39:02,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

1160
01:39:02,601 --> 01:39:02,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1161
01:39:04,043 --> 01:39:05,204
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Mike.

1162
01:39:07,626 --> 01:39:08,367
[SPEAKER_58]: Nancy Hogan.

1163
01:39:08,387 --> 01:39:10,089
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi, Nancy.

1164
01:39:13,669 --> 01:39:14,069
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

1165
01:39:14,189 --> 01:39:18,711
[SPEAKER_56]: My name is Nancy Hogan, and I reside at 42 Tyler Ave.

1166
01:39:19,271 --> 01:39:21,232
[SPEAKER_56]: I've resided there for 28 years.

1167
01:39:21,252 --> 01:39:24,733
[SPEAKER_56]: I've invested in this property and in the community in my neighborhood.

1168
01:39:24,753 --> 01:39:27,094
[SPEAKER_56]: I love the street that I live on.

1169
01:39:27,114 --> 01:39:34,136
[SPEAKER_56]: Our houses are already placed very close together, so there's a density within our neighborhood that exists.

1170
01:39:34,156 --> 01:39:41,059
[SPEAKER_56]: There also are several two-family houses, although our street is zoned for single-family homes.

1171
01:39:41,739 --> 01:40:01,895
[SPEAKER_56]: I did contact the city the development department and I was able to download from the map the setbacks and all the other requirements for my particular property which was built in 1925 and I'd like to say that our neighborhood was never considered to be built in a way that would change the character or the nature of this neighborhood.

1172
01:40:02,235 --> 01:40:04,697
[SPEAKER_56]: I've spent my entire career in affordable housing

1173
01:40:05,137 --> 01:40:08,260
[SPEAKER_56]: As a professional, I feel very strongly about affordable housing.

1174
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:14,125
[SPEAKER_56]: But I also believe that our current neighborhoods in West Medford were not built for multifamily use.

1175
01:40:14,645 --> 01:40:18,288
[SPEAKER_56]: And I think it would significantly change the character of our neighborhoods.

1176
01:40:18,668 --> 01:40:22,792
[SPEAKER_56]: I think there are other ways to help solve the problems that we are challenged by with affordable housing.

1177
01:40:23,192 --> 01:40:30,395
[SPEAKER_56]: We have other areas that are zoned for multifamily use and commercial use and can create a great tax basis for the city.

1178
01:40:31,135 --> 01:40:36,197
[SPEAKER_56]: So I would like to say that I strongly oppose this proposal.

1179
01:40:36,818 --> 01:40:42,580
[SPEAKER_56]: And the other thing that I'm also confused about is we are Medford Square adjacent on Tyler Avenue.

1180
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:48,586
[SPEAKER_56]: people many people cut through our street to get to the commuter rail parking and also to drop off kids to St.

1181
01:40:48,626 --> 01:41:03,079
[SPEAKER_56]: Ray's which is fine but creating a further density to this the street in particular I'm also going to obviously want to defend our street but I do want to say that our area right around that neighborhood would be very highly impacted by increasing the density.

1182
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,100
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you very much.

1183
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,623
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you Nancy.

1184
01:41:16,573 --> 01:41:17,153
[SPEAKER_58]: you're ready.

1185
01:41:17,974 --> 01:41:20,054
[SPEAKER_06]: John Elliott, 34 Emery Street.

1186
01:41:20,454 --> 01:41:20,855
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi, John.

1187
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:21,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1188
01:41:22,995 --> 01:41:25,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lost faith and trust in the rezoning effort.

1189
01:41:26,176 --> 01:41:32,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Rezoning is on a course that will render the city less attractive, less desirable and harder to afford.

1190
01:41:32,278 --> 01:41:45,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I came to this conclusion after six months of witnessing the procedures and methods being practiced by PDS Management, the CDB and the City Council's Planning and Permitting Committee.

1191
01:41:46,003 --> 01:41:48,205
[SPEAKER_06]: blowing off three paragraph hole here.

1192
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:55,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Density is needed in Medford in order to receive, relieve a critical housing shortage.

1193
01:41:56,652 --> 01:42:10,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford had a net population decline over the last four years of 2.11% since the 2020 census and a forecast of continued decline over the next four years from world population review.

1194
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:14,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they taking their houses with them when they go to the grave?

1195
01:42:15,414 --> 01:42:19,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they taking their houses with them when they move to New Hampshire because they can't afford it?

1196
01:42:22,082 --> 01:42:25,606
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only way I can figure that we're losing housing.

1197
01:42:27,148 --> 01:42:27,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Another hole.

1198
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:32,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Which brings us to proximity to frequently running transit.

1199
01:42:32,712 --> 01:42:47,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Baker's MassDOT located the Greenline extension so that it serves Tufts well, but the surrounding areas, the College Avenue station is largely occupied by, among other things, the Tufts campus, 20 acres of athletic fields,

1200
01:42:49,105 --> 01:43:10,712
[SPEAKER_06]: without any residential buildings and maybe in use 2% of the time, and a 6.5-acre tract with 36 lots and 36 dwellings that zoning effort is expected to reclassify as Tufts Institutional with dimensional limits so far unpublished.

1201
01:43:12,170 --> 01:43:20,272
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems unlikely to me that any of these will become dwellings that ease any housing shortage and preferably contribute to the tax rolls.

1202
01:43:21,172 --> 01:43:23,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And that leads us to tax implications.

1203
01:43:24,292 --> 01:43:27,593
[SPEAKER_06]: In a refreshing bit of honesty.

1204
01:43:27,613 --> 01:43:27,993
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 seconds.

1205
01:43:28,013 --> 01:43:28,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1206
01:43:28,753 --> 01:43:38,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week, the city councilor identified a city councilor identified that the real motive for the overall zoning overall was to, uh,

1207
01:43:40,104 --> 01:43:42,364
[SPEAKER_06]: address a historic budget issue.

1208
01:43:43,505 --> 01:43:51,706
[SPEAKER_06]: It's possible that rezoning is in order, but just implementing the state's ADU mandate could very well meet the need for housing.

1209
01:43:52,587 --> 01:44:02,929
[SPEAKER_06]: If turning attractive neighborhoods into cheek-by-jowl rabbit warrens solves housing shortages, it does so by making them less desirable, which reduces demand.

1210
01:44:03,929 --> 01:44:08,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Ditch all this, involve the citizenry, and come back with a sensible plan.

1211
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:09,430
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, John.

1212
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:20,121
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm going to go back to Zoom commenters.

1213
01:44:21,342 --> 01:44:23,563
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Alexander Jenko.

1214
01:44:27,525 --> 01:44:29,305
[SPEAKER_58]: Alexander, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

1215
01:44:29,325 --> 01:44:31,726
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi there.

1216
01:44:31,766 --> 01:44:32,647
[SPEAKER_42]: Can you hear me?

1217
01:44:33,427 --> 01:44:34,168
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes, thank you.

1218
01:44:34,808 --> 01:44:35,568
[SPEAKER_42]: Great.

1219
01:44:36,008 --> 01:44:46,153
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'll skip a lot of the stuff that other people have said, but I noticed a couple of things that caused problems, I think, with zoning.

1220
01:44:46,882 --> 01:44:49,422
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm on Shapely Avenue right now, which is in South Medford.

1221
01:44:49,462 --> 01:44:59,284
[SPEAKER_42]: And it does seem like, as is the case in other parts of the city, that the different sides of the street are zoned differently, which I don't think really makes sense.

1222
01:44:59,324 --> 01:45:02,185
[SPEAKER_42]: I think we should continue to go street by street instead of block by block.

1223
01:45:04,805 --> 01:45:07,746
[SPEAKER_42]: I also think, yes, we are going a little bit too fast here.

1224
01:45:08,686 --> 01:45:13,487
[SPEAKER_42]: But one thing that I think would help with that is,

1225
01:45:15,647 --> 01:45:28,619
[SPEAKER_42]: We are, as we stated in earlier meetings, zoning the squares, zoning the corridors first to establish demand and develop demand for development there makes sense.

1226
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:40,690
[SPEAKER_42]: Why don't we, but I think one thing that's become apparent, especially in this meeting is that Medford has a big transition from like South Medford and Medford Square to the northern part of the city.

1227
01:45:41,522 --> 01:45:47,145
[SPEAKER_42]: Uh, why, why do we, why do we, why do we have to increase density all the way across to like the Winchester border?

1228
01:45:47,185 --> 01:46:01,311
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, why, why, why can we not, uh, increase density in places that make more sense where it's more walkable, like in South Medford, where I live and still maintain some of the open space and the neighborhood character that exists on the, uh, in, in the other areas.

1229
01:46:01,331 --> 01:46:02,831
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, I enjoy living on my street.

1230
01:46:02,851 --> 01:46:05,613
[SPEAKER_42]: There are a lot of, there are a lot of children on the street, mine included.

1231
01:46:05,633 --> 01:46:08,154
[SPEAKER_42]: There's like seven kids on the block that are under the age of five.

1232
01:46:08,754 --> 01:46:11,095
[SPEAKER_42]: And I liked that part of the density and it, and it creates.

1233
01:46:12,073 --> 01:46:17,755
[SPEAKER_42]: and it's affordable for us, but it's obviously a much different part of the city than the northern part of the city.

1234
01:46:17,795 --> 01:46:26,539
[SPEAKER_42]: So I think it would be helpful if the city council and the CDB could take a more nuanced approach to zoning across the city.

1235
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:27,479
[SPEAKER_42]: Thanks.

1236
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:30,200
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Alexander.

1237
01:46:36,283 --> 01:46:37,523
[SPEAKER_58]: We're gonna go back to in-person.

1238
01:46:37,563 --> 01:46:41,325
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Lori Flagg, Janice Blatt, Anita Nagin,

1239
01:46:51,157 --> 01:46:52,798
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Laurie Flagg.

1240
01:46:52,818 --> 01:46:54,979
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on Godfield Avenue in Manford.

1241
01:46:55,659 --> 01:47:10,947
[SPEAKER_12]: First, I'd like to tell you guys with all this zoning and the dispensary thing that we went through last summer on Salem Street, you've brought our community closer together and more in tune with one another.

1242
01:47:11,983 --> 01:47:21,775
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to go along and go over all the other things like everybody's already said, but one big thing in addition to water and sewer is fire.

1243
01:47:22,415 --> 01:47:25,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at the fires that have just happened in the last few months.

1244
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,482
[SPEAKER_12]: California is devastated.

1245
01:47:29,604 --> 01:47:30,885
[SPEAKER_12]: The fire in Winthrop.

1246
01:47:31,666 --> 01:47:37,572
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, density is just going to take out full neighborhoods if a fire takes place.

1247
01:47:38,233 --> 01:47:45,140
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'd like to share something with the public, since you already have this, that they're probably unaware of.

1248
01:47:45,961 --> 01:47:47,963
[SPEAKER_12]: This is from Councilor Lazzaro.

1249
01:47:49,064 --> 01:47:50,946
[SPEAKER_12]: to the Community Development Board.

1250
01:47:51,707 --> 01:47:58,793
[SPEAKER_12]: I am writing to register my support to the proposal before you for neighborhood residential zoning.

1251
01:47:59,273 --> 01:48:12,646
[SPEAKER_12]: This proposal makes it possible for Medford to begin to meet the housing needs of the region in an organic manner as residents decide to move on and sell their

1252
01:48:13,807 --> 01:48:16,772
[SPEAKER_12]: their properties to interested buyers?

1253
01:48:17,433 --> 01:48:22,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, most of your homeowners are over the age of 50 and above.

1254
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:27,989
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know that any of us are looking to go up stories on our single family homes.

1255
01:48:28,610 --> 01:48:28,770
[SPEAKER_12]: But

1256
01:48:29,411 --> 01:48:44,950
[SPEAKER_12]: I caution the Community Development Board to not be swayed by folks who have been recently frightened into thinking that the proposal will quickly, dramatically change their neighborhoods.

1257
01:48:45,511 --> 01:48:48,573
[SPEAKER_12]: As the board knows, zoning does not work that way.

1258
01:48:49,053 --> 01:48:55,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Zoning is a slow and intentional process with which we have been engaged for years.

1259
01:48:56,336 --> 01:49:01,259
[SPEAKER_12]: We have been thoughtful and studied about how we have gone through these matters.

1260
01:49:01,859 --> 01:49:08,382
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are carefully thinking about how best to address methods, high cost of housing.

1261
01:49:08,862 --> 01:49:13,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Updating our zoning ordinance is one tool in our toolbox.

1262
01:49:14,525 --> 01:49:39,907
[SPEAKER_12]: I also would like to mention that single family zoning is also known as exclusionary zoning, which, to quote the Boston Globe, rose to prominence in the early 20th century as a policy tool for keeping some neighborhoods exclusive along racial boundaries,

1263
01:49:40,588 --> 01:49:43,951
[SPEAKER_12]: by preventing the construction of apartments.

1264
01:49:44,691 --> 01:50:03,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Maintaining single-family zoning in the richest, whitest part of Medford, which also happens to be very close to the only commuter rail station 11 minutes from North Station in Boston, will be segregationalist and unacceptable.

1265
01:50:04,007 --> 01:50:04,808
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm so sorry, Laurie.

1266
01:50:04,848 --> 01:50:06,811
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm going to go have to go ahead and make you out of respect.

1267
01:50:06,831 --> 01:50:10,437
[SPEAKER_12]: You should be ashamed that one of our Councilors wrote.

1268
01:50:19,367 --> 01:50:20,127
[SPEAKER_60]: Hi, thank you.

1269
01:50:20,207 --> 01:50:20,708
[SPEAKER_60]: Hi, everybody.

1270
01:50:21,508 --> 01:50:22,708
[SPEAKER_60]: My name is Janice Blatt.

1271
01:50:22,768 --> 01:50:23,969
[SPEAKER_60]: I live on Placestead Road.

1272
01:50:24,229 --> 01:50:25,930
[SPEAKER_60]: I've been there for 24 years.

1273
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:28,010
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm a single woman homeowner.

1274
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:34,153
[SPEAKER_60]: I saved, worked really hard, got my 20%, put it down 24 years ago, and have been maintaining my home.

1275
01:50:34,313 --> 01:50:42,476
[SPEAKER_60]: And I just want to say Placestead Road is one of the prettiest roads in the city, although now it has a bunch of plastic barriers at the end of it, but we'll deal with that later.

1276
01:50:45,177 --> 01:50:47,918
[SPEAKER_60]: My comment, a lot has been said on the residential development

1277
01:50:48,855 --> 01:51:15,947
[SPEAKER_60]: I want to talk about how I feel for a minute, and having come from corporate America for several years, a fairly high ranking position, the way I feel when the meeting like this starts with the mayor, the highest ranking person in our city, who is on vacation, who feels compelled, as we all did, no matter how we feel, to be here tonight, starts the meeting by saying, stop, none of my people know what's going on,

1278
01:51:16,425 --> 01:51:17,546
[SPEAKER_60]: We have no financials.

1279
01:51:17,566 --> 01:51:18,786
[SPEAKER_60]: We don't have the money for it.

1280
01:51:20,167 --> 01:51:26,250
[SPEAKER_60]: And then the commissioner, who's nice enough to be here of public works, says, I haven't seen any financials.

1281
01:51:27,090 --> 01:51:33,253
[SPEAKER_60]: It sounds like this is some philosophical presentation to change over Medford.

1282
01:51:34,054 --> 01:51:35,294
[SPEAKER_60]: I didn't move to Somerville.

1283
01:51:35,435 --> 01:51:36,615
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't want to be Somerville.

1284
01:51:36,995 --> 01:51:38,276
[SPEAKER_60]: If I did, I would have bought there.

1285
01:51:38,756 --> 01:51:39,777
[SPEAKER_60]: I would have bought in Cambridge.

1286
01:51:39,837 --> 01:51:40,697
[SPEAKER_60]: This is Medford.

1287
01:51:41,498 --> 01:51:44,559
[SPEAKER_60]: And the word density is, to me, is poison.

1288
01:51:44,579 --> 01:51:45,039
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm sorry.

1289
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:52,552
[SPEAKER_60]: It sounds like a political and philosophical consulting buzzword.

1290
01:51:52,712 --> 01:51:53,093
[SPEAKER_60]: 30 seconds.

1291
01:51:53,493 --> 01:51:53,953
[SPEAKER_60]: That's fine.

1292
01:51:54,313 --> 01:51:56,075
[SPEAKER_60]: I want to comment on West Medford, too.

1293
01:51:56,455 --> 01:52:02,579
[SPEAKER_60]: If you want to make that a walking city, do you see the oil tankers, the kids crossing the street, the church getting out?

1294
01:52:02,999 --> 01:52:04,820
[SPEAKER_60]: It's the only commercial pass-through road.

1295
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:07,542
[SPEAKER_60]: Medford is a pass-through town, whether we like it or not.

1296
01:52:07,842 --> 01:52:14,806
[SPEAKER_60]: You see the circle on High Street and Winthrop, and you're going to add more people living there to come down that and go to the other traffic circle.

1297
01:52:15,286 --> 01:52:17,208
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't want to be Somerville, and I don't want to be dense.

1298
01:52:19,899 --> 01:52:21,120
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Janice.

1299
01:52:27,483 --> 01:52:28,663
[SPEAKER_75]: My name is Anita Nagum.

1300
01:52:28,763 --> 01:52:30,004
[SPEAKER_75]: I live at 9 Norton Avenue.

1301
01:52:31,612 --> 01:52:39,875
[SPEAKER_75]: First, I agree with everyone, almost everyone who has commented saying that this plan is being rushed and that public notification has been miserable.

1302
01:52:40,676 --> 01:52:42,016
[SPEAKER_75]: I have two specific comments.

1303
01:52:43,017 --> 01:52:54,281
[SPEAKER_75]: First, any new rezoning plan must codify a homeowner's right to have solar panels and not have those panels blocked by any new construction, even if they have not yet installed them.

1304
01:52:55,061 --> 01:52:56,102
[SPEAKER_75]: Solar panels are

1305
01:52:57,843 --> 01:53:03,466
[SPEAKER_75]: even now, an environmental necessity and in the short-term future will be an absolute necessity.

1306
01:53:03,486 --> 01:53:09,730
[SPEAKER_75]: It will also be an economic necessity for many because the price of electricity is beginning to skyrocket.

1307
01:53:10,010 --> 01:53:13,692
[SPEAKER_75]: With new AI data centers, they are going to be required by many.

1308
01:53:14,733 --> 01:53:20,396
[SPEAKER_75]: Rezoning must consider the future consequences and rushing to solve one problem can create others.

1309
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:33,152
[SPEAKER_75]: Second, at one of the previous meetings, Innes Associates stated that when parking concerns were raised that, oh, the MBTA usually increases bus service if housing density increases.

1310
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:40,461
[SPEAKER_75]: They seem to be totally unaware that the MBTA is redesigning the entire bus network.

1311
01:53:40,521 --> 01:53:44,742
[SPEAKER_75]: This plan was revised three years ago, finalized in December of 2022.

1312
01:53:44,842 --> 01:53:50,344
[SPEAKER_75]: West Medford in particular is going to have a significant reduction in bus service.

1313
01:53:51,184 --> 01:53:52,885
[SPEAKER_75]: I have been fighting this plan for three years.

1314
01:53:55,641 --> 01:53:59,963
[SPEAKER_75]: created several community petitions with almost 2,000 signatures.

1315
01:54:00,743 --> 01:54:05,565
[SPEAKER_75]: I've been working with elected representatives to fight this.

1316
01:54:05,865 --> 01:54:07,165
[SPEAKER_75]: We have had limited success.

1317
01:54:07,545 --> 01:54:13,748
[SPEAKER_75]: Other communities in the MBTA system have also been fighting and trying to get remediation on some of these issues.

1318
01:54:14,348 --> 01:54:16,709
[SPEAKER_75]: It is going to be a long shot to get this done.

1319
01:54:17,489 --> 01:54:24,312
[SPEAKER_75]: And the third thing is, please do not try and use the MBTA Communities Act as an excuse to increase density around West Medford.

1320
01:54:25,312 --> 01:54:34,679
[SPEAKER_75]: The Communities Act requires any community with MBTA service to have one zone where multi-family housing is allowed by right.

1321
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:39,783
[SPEAKER_75]: It is not required at every station in any community.

1322
01:54:40,243 --> 01:54:44,467
[SPEAKER_75]: Medford is already in compliance with the Wellington zone.

1323
01:54:45,707 --> 01:54:46,188
[SPEAKER_75]: Thank you.

1324
01:54:53,728 --> 01:54:56,670
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm going to go back to our Zoom queue.

1325
01:54:57,911 --> 01:54:58,492
[SPEAKER_58]: Andy Beck.

1326
01:55:02,375 --> 01:55:03,816
[SPEAKER_58]: Andy, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

1327
01:55:04,977 --> 01:55:05,317
[SPEAKER_71]: Hello?

1328
01:55:07,138 --> 01:55:07,699
[SPEAKER_71]: Can you hear me?

1329
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,621
[SPEAKER_58]: We can, but it's very, very light.

1330
01:55:11,261 --> 01:55:12,382
[SPEAKER_71]: Let me turn up my volume.

1331
01:55:13,343 --> 01:55:13,923
[SPEAKER_71]: Let's see.

1332
01:55:14,224 --> 01:55:14,684
[SPEAKER_71]: OK.

1333
01:55:15,525 --> 01:55:15,905
[SPEAKER_71]: Here we go.

1334
01:55:18,302 --> 01:55:19,463
[SPEAKER_71]: Uh, I hope you can hear me.

1335
01:55:19,503 --> 01:55:21,844
[SPEAKER_71]: Well, I have lived in.

1336
01:55:21,864 --> 01:55:25,106
[SPEAKER_71]: Yeah, I've lived in Medford for 45 years.

1337
01:55:25,927 --> 01:55:28,508
[SPEAKER_71]: My 1st house costs 42,000 dollars.

1338
01:55:30,409 --> 01:55:32,471
[SPEAKER_71]: I am not selling my house.

1339
01:55:32,811 --> 01:55:33,951
[SPEAKER_71]: I'm not a developer.

1340
01:55:35,413 --> 01:55:37,254
[SPEAKER_71]: I'm not interested in a big score.

1341
01:55:38,115 --> 01:55:40,537
[SPEAKER_71]: What I am interested in is quality of life.

1342
01:55:41,978 --> 01:55:48,885
[SPEAKER_71]: And while I support the notion of affordable housing, I will give this board solid examples.

1343
01:55:49,145 --> 01:55:52,328
[SPEAKER_71]: I live on Arlington Street in West Medford.

1344
01:55:52,848 --> 01:55:54,170
[SPEAKER_71]: And in Arlington Street,

1345
01:55:56,291 --> 01:56:03,613
[SPEAKER_71]: We've had six houses come up for sale, well, I should say be redeveloped by developers.

1346
01:56:04,613 --> 01:56:06,854
[SPEAKER_71]: Each of them have sold for over a million dollars.

1347
01:56:07,154 --> 01:56:08,374
[SPEAKER_71]: This is on Arlington Street.

1348
01:56:10,015 --> 01:56:14,136
[SPEAKER_71]: Again, the developers bought, knocked down the property, put up two condos.

1349
01:56:14,156 --> 01:56:17,957
[SPEAKER_71]: Another developer bought a lot that was large enough.

1350
01:56:18,517 --> 01:56:23,181
[SPEAKER_71]: to fit two houses with no backyard for either house, each sold for $1.1 million.

1351
01:56:24,321 --> 01:56:30,286
[SPEAKER_71]: So this is what really happens when these kinds of situations present themselves.

1352
01:56:30,366 --> 01:56:42,255
[SPEAKER_71]: Affordable housing is necessary, but if we have no reign over developers by legislation, then what we have are people buying up properties and making a buck on them.

1353
01:56:42,995 --> 01:56:51,602
[SPEAKER_71]: And so for me, the important thing is the quality of life in my neighborhood, with my neighbors, with my community.

1354
01:56:52,082 --> 01:57:06,874
[SPEAKER_71]: And my concern about this for the board, yeah, my concern to share with you for somebody who's lived in this city for 45 years and raised a son here who couldn't afford to live here and had to move to Peabody is that,

1355
01:57:08,933 --> 01:57:10,413
[SPEAKER_71]: change in manageable bites.

1356
01:57:11,053 --> 01:57:15,274
[SPEAKER_71]: In my work life, I had the experience of working with the president of Charles Schwab.

1357
01:57:15,794 --> 01:57:22,976
[SPEAKER_71]: He said when I tried whole scale organizational change, it failed because I was the only one who owned that change.

1358
01:57:23,696 --> 01:57:25,557
[SPEAKER_71]: No one else owned that who worked here.

1359
01:57:26,057 --> 01:57:28,937
[SPEAKER_71]: And that's what the city council I see is trying to do here.

1360
01:57:29,337 --> 01:57:31,258
[SPEAKER_71]: The residents do not own this change.

1361
01:57:32,098 --> 01:57:33,319
[SPEAKER_71]: or the City Council does.

1362
01:57:33,419 --> 01:57:38,041
[SPEAKER_71]: And if we want to have a community that owns change, it has to be in manageable bites.

1363
01:57:38,382 --> 01:57:38,762
[SPEAKER_71]: Thank you.

1364
01:57:41,083 --> 01:57:41,583
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Andy.

1365
01:57:41,603 --> 01:57:44,285
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go back to our in-person commenters.

1366
01:57:46,386 --> 01:57:49,888
[SPEAKER_58]: Kelly Catalo, Elizabeth Bale, Elise Copley.

1367
01:57:49,908 --> 01:57:56,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1368
01:58:01,746 --> 01:58:11,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Kelly Catalo, 23 Salem Street, Medford, and a 33-year realtor of the city of Medford, which makes me an expert on the valuation of property.

1369
01:58:12,414 --> 01:58:23,683
[SPEAKER_11]: That zoning proposal to tear this city apart, to put a six-unit building in the middle of West Medford, what happened on Salem Street, what they want to do on Garfield Street,

1370
01:58:24,163 --> 01:58:28,668
[SPEAKER_11]: is going to negatively affect the value of all of those properties.

1371
01:58:29,209 --> 01:58:30,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Those six units will go up.

1372
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:32,952
[SPEAKER_11]: The developers are calling everybody in this city.

1373
01:58:32,972 --> 01:58:34,013
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys all own homes.

1374
01:58:34,034 --> 01:58:35,375
[SPEAKER_11]: You're getting phone calls.

1375
01:58:35,795 --> 01:58:41,181
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to know if you want to sell your property, because they want to buy it today, because the minute that that passes,

1376
01:58:41,561 --> 01:58:43,702
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to go put up three to six units.

1377
01:58:44,102 --> 01:58:46,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they're going to convert them to condos.

1378
01:58:46,583 --> 01:58:49,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they're going to go sell them for over a million dollars.

1379
01:58:50,104 --> 01:58:52,605
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not going to help the values of the city of Medford.

1380
01:58:52,725 --> 01:58:57,646
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not going to bring, density is not going to bring affordable housing to Medford.

1381
01:58:58,067 --> 01:59:00,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at Stations Landing as your example.

1382
01:59:00,928 --> 01:59:07,830
[SPEAKER_11]: When Stations Landing was built, the people of Medford could not afford $3,000 for a two-bedroom apartment.

1383
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:13,032
[SPEAKER_11]: People from other communities that could afford it moved into Stations Landing.

1384
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:20,716
[SPEAKER_11]: At that time, across the street, those condos on 9th Street, the ones that were rented, were renting for $1,400 to $1,500.

1385
01:59:21,557 --> 01:59:28,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, pretty soon, the people that were paying $3,000 went across the street and said, well, I'll pay you $2,500.

1386
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:32,002
[SPEAKER_11]: All's the density did was drive up the cost of housing.

1387
01:59:32,522 --> 01:59:36,683
[SPEAKER_11]: You do have some tools that could really bring affordable housing to Medford.

1388
01:59:37,143 --> 01:59:48,985
[SPEAKER_11]: If we look at the GIS maps and we look at North Medford, the majority of the lots are 4,000 square feet, yet your zoning says that you need 5,000 square feet for a single family.

1389
01:59:49,585 --> 01:59:53,166
[SPEAKER_11]: On Wilson Street, there was a piece of property recently sold.

1390
01:59:53,506 --> 01:59:58,367
[SPEAKER_11]: There are two McMansions that are now built on a piece of land that is just shy of 12,000 square feet.

1391
01:59:58,427 --> 01:59:58,707
[SPEAKER_11]: However,

1392
02:00:01,307 --> 02:00:12,581
[SPEAKER_11]: If you brought down the zoning on that to be 4,000 in North Medford, you could have had three single family homes that meet the neighborhood, that fit into the neighborhood.

1393
02:00:13,041 --> 02:00:14,163
[SPEAKER_11]: If we look at a four...

1394
02:00:15,852 --> 02:00:20,797
[SPEAKER_11]: The ADU units, I know I'm running short, I'm gonna ask you for another minute, because I'm trying to give you something that you can use.

1395
02:00:21,037 --> 02:00:22,378
[SPEAKER_11]: I can give you about 30 seconds.

1396
02:00:22,438 --> 02:00:22,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1397
02:00:23,339 --> 02:00:29,265
[SPEAKER_11]: The ADU units, we have 7,800 single family homes in the city of Medford.

1398
02:00:29,645 --> 02:00:32,327
[SPEAKER_11]: A one bedroom apartment right now, the low end is $2,100.

1399
02:00:34,129 --> 02:00:36,871
[SPEAKER_11]: An ADU in Medford is going to rent at about $1,600.

1400
02:00:37,612 --> 02:00:41,115
[SPEAKER_11]: How many of your kids could stay in Medford at that?

1401
02:00:41,195 --> 02:00:42,196
[SPEAKER_11]: They could stay here.

1402
02:00:42,516 --> 02:00:46,319
[SPEAKER_11]: How many of our elderly people, they can't afford these bigger places.

1403
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:48,942
[SPEAKER_11]: They could stay in Medford at that price.

1404
02:00:49,282 --> 02:00:56,968
[SPEAKER_11]: So creating the ADUs is creating housing that is affordable naturally to the people of Medford.

1405
02:00:57,289 --> 02:01:01,712
[SPEAKER_11]: However, if you take that same single family and you now make it a two-family house,

1406
02:01:02,473 --> 02:01:11,038
[SPEAKER_11]: I guarantee you, now we're at 1.5 million for the two family, or maybe we'll split it in half, go sell it to two condos, and a million one or a million two apiece.

1407
02:01:11,518 --> 02:01:13,720
[SPEAKER_11]: None of that is gonna create affordable housing.

1408
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:14,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1409
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,781
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1410
02:01:25,226 --> 02:01:26,007
[SPEAKER_58]: Elizabeth Bale.

1411
02:01:30,401 --> 02:01:32,962
[SPEAKER_33]: Elizabeth Bale, 34 Emory Street.

1412
02:01:33,062 --> 02:01:35,362
[SPEAKER_33]: There's so little time and so much to say.

1413
02:01:35,382 --> 02:01:41,684
[SPEAKER_33]: I just want to say that we bought our house in 1987.

1414
02:01:41,804 --> 02:01:42,484
[SPEAKER_33]: Our house was built in 1895.

1415
02:01:42,604 --> 02:01:45,125
[SPEAKER_33]: Medford was incorporated as a city in 1892.

1416
02:01:45,165 --> 02:01:46,785
[SPEAKER_33]: Our house was probably a farmhouse.

1417
02:01:46,805 --> 02:01:48,425
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't think it was exclusionary.

1418
02:01:55,927 --> 02:02:11,893
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, we took a broken down house that was in miserable condition with a lot that had a broken down truck and a bunch of gravel in it and made a really nice house with a beautiful garden.

1419
02:02:12,813 --> 02:02:17,555
[SPEAKER_33]: And we have trees around our property that are probably 50 years old.

1420
02:02:19,255 --> 02:02:21,457
[SPEAKER_33]: And we live on a one-way street.

1421
02:02:21,677 --> 02:02:22,738
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a short street.

1422
02:02:22,858 --> 02:02:28,242
[SPEAKER_33]: It's got about 20 houses, about half single-family, about half two-family.

1423
02:02:29,142 --> 02:02:32,105
[SPEAKER_33]: And with the changes, it was supposed to be NR3.

1424
02:02:32,325 --> 02:02:36,708
[SPEAKER_33]: And I was not going to object to that.

1425
02:02:37,308 --> 02:02:45,494
[SPEAKER_33]: But bumping it up to UR1 and saying that single-family homes can no longer be built by right is too extreme.

1426
02:02:46,495 --> 02:02:59,931
[SPEAKER_33]: And if you stayed with NR3, you could double or triple or possibly even quadruple the number of housing units just by adding the ADUs, the townhouses, the three families.

1427
02:03:00,451 --> 02:03:02,734
[SPEAKER_33]: We have only one three-family at the moment.

1428
02:03:03,314 --> 02:03:03,654
[SPEAKER_33]: 30 seconds.

1429
02:03:03,714 --> 02:03:05,455
[SPEAKER_33]: You asked about setbacks.

1430
02:03:05,795 --> 02:03:14,439
[SPEAKER_33]: Five feet for a setback doesn't even let you put up a ladder to paint your house or change a window or even move an air conditioner.

1431
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:18,241
[SPEAKER_33]: How are people supposed to deal with this?

1432
02:03:19,722 --> 02:03:28,026
[SPEAKER_33]: We really have a neighborhood and people help each other and it feels safe, but there's not room for more houses and cars.

1433
02:03:28,126 --> 02:03:29,226
[SPEAKER_33]: We have small lots.

1434
02:03:29,306 --> 02:03:30,407
[SPEAKER_33]: It's a one-way street.

1435
02:03:31,407 --> 02:03:37,830
[SPEAKER_33]: and density is just not appropriate everywhere, at least more than NR3 level.

1436
02:03:38,430 --> 02:03:38,830
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1437
02:03:39,991 --> 02:03:45,033
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Elizabeth.

1438
02:03:45,273 --> 02:03:49,015
[SPEAKER_48]: Emily, I'm sorry, could you just, which street were you referring to?

1439
02:03:49,035 --> 02:03:49,655
[SPEAKER_48]: I missed it.

1440
02:03:51,378 --> 02:03:52,778
[SPEAKER_58]: We have an address.

1441
02:03:53,318 --> 02:03:58,119
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm not gonna like stalk you, but just to like kind of cross check and kind of contextualize what you're saying.

1442
02:03:58,259 --> 02:04:01,480
[SPEAKER_58]: But that sort of feedback is super helpful because of how specific it is.

1443
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:04,100
[SPEAKER_58]: So thank you for coming and commenting this evening.

1444
02:04:07,921 --> 02:04:08,981
[SPEAKER_58]: Elise, okay.

1445
02:04:10,442 --> 02:04:13,682
[SPEAKER_58]: Elise, I believe you are now joining us through Zoom.

1446
02:04:13,842 --> 02:04:15,323
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm gonna go ahead and unmute you.

1447
02:04:15,523 --> 02:04:17,203
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you for your flexibility this evening.

1448
02:04:20,683 --> 02:04:22,705
[SPEAKER_57]: Elyse, Elyse Copley, right?

1449
02:04:22,785 --> 02:04:23,045
[SPEAKER_57]: Yeah.

1450
02:04:26,748 --> 02:04:27,168
[SPEAKER_44]: Hi, Elyse.

1451
02:04:27,228 --> 02:04:27,488
[SPEAKER_44]: Hello.

1452
02:04:27,969 --> 02:04:28,409
[SPEAKER_44]: Hi.

1453
02:04:29,470 --> 02:04:30,030
[SPEAKER_44]: Can you hear me?

1454
02:04:30,831 --> 02:04:31,051
[SPEAKER_44]: Yes.

1455
02:04:31,171 --> 02:04:31,632
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1456
02:04:33,033 --> 02:04:33,813
[SPEAKER_44]: Elyse Copley.

1457
02:04:33,974 --> 02:04:39,438
[SPEAKER_46]: I live on Sagamore Avenue and I'm here to voice my strong opposition

1458
02:04:40,157 --> 02:04:41,698
[SPEAKER_46]: to the zoning proposals.

1459
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:43,780
[SPEAKER_46]: We've heard people say, slow down.

1460
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,621
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not gonna ask to slow down.

1461
02:04:45,721 --> 02:04:48,843
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm gonna ask that it just be rejected.

1462
02:04:49,143 --> 02:04:52,866
[SPEAKER_46]: I'd like to start by saying Medford doesn't have a housing crisis.

1463
02:04:52,886 --> 02:04:54,027
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm gonna say it again.

1464
02:04:54,107 --> 02:04:56,388
[SPEAKER_46]: Medford doesn't have a housing crisis.

1465
02:04:56,909 --> 02:05:08,757
[SPEAKER_46]: So to be clear, these proposals are not in response to a problem that the city of Medford faces, rather it's a philosophy that not all of the residents sign on to.

1466
02:05:09,710 --> 02:05:14,294
[SPEAKER_46]: First, people have said that this proposal is in line with the comprehensive plan.

1467
02:05:14,354 --> 02:05:15,555
[SPEAKER_46]: That's just not true.

1468
02:05:15,755 --> 02:05:22,881
[SPEAKER_46]: If you read the comprehensive plan, there's nowhere in the comprehensive plan where it advocates for these sweeping zoning changes.

1469
02:05:23,662 --> 02:05:34,971
[SPEAKER_46]: The other thing about the comprehensive plan is if you look at how that was put together, there was not overwhelming feedback and collaboration and input from the residents of Medford.

1470
02:05:37,009 --> 02:05:48,374
[SPEAKER_46]: Also the comprehensive plan states that by 2030, we expect maybe a 6% increase in the residents of Medford.

1471
02:05:48,414 --> 02:05:50,895
[SPEAKER_46]: That's a guesstimate.

1472
02:05:51,875 --> 02:05:58,798
[SPEAKER_46]: I have no idea how much housing the proposal will add in my own lot that I have.

1473
02:05:59,278 --> 02:06:03,920
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm gonna go from a single family house to upwards of six units on my lot.

1474
02:06:05,044 --> 02:06:07,925
[SPEAKER_46]: or potentially eight if you count the ADUs.

1475
02:06:08,506 --> 02:06:13,888
[SPEAKER_46]: Second, the effect of the ADUs has not been considered in the comprehensive plan and it should be.

1476
02:06:13,908 --> 02:06:22,491
[SPEAKER_46]: The preservation of the neighborhoods in Medford is something that really should be done on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis.

1477
02:06:22,791 --> 02:06:31,235
[SPEAKER_46]: We should get the input of the neighborhood to decide how that neighborhood would like to move forward rather than these sweeping changes citywide.

1478
02:06:31,991 --> 02:06:37,535
[SPEAKER_46]: Density, I just want to say, I can already see into my neighbor's kitchen.

1479
02:06:37,855 --> 02:06:39,216
[SPEAKER_46]: They can see into my windows.

1480
02:06:39,796 --> 02:06:41,037
[SPEAKER_46]: I don't want more density.

1481
02:06:41,077 --> 02:06:45,080
[SPEAKER_46]: And I think the vast majority of my neighbors do not want more density.

1482
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:56,167
[SPEAKER_46]: We are already more dense than Arlington, Stoneham, Melrose, Winchester, all of our neighbors, with the exception for Cambridge and Somerville, who happen to rank first and second

1483
02:06:56,713 --> 02:07:00,897
[SPEAKER_46]: among the most dense cities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1484
02:07:01,257 --> 02:07:07,542
[SPEAKER_46]: And as people have said, we don't want to be the third most densely populated city in the state.

1485
02:07:07,742 --> 02:07:14,728
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, finally, this infrastructure, at a minimum, what we're hearing

1486
02:07:15,353 --> 02:07:18,174
[SPEAKER_46]: from our leaders is that we haven't studied it.

1487
02:07:18,414 --> 02:07:20,014
[SPEAKER_46]: We don't know, we're not ready.

1488
02:07:20,214 --> 02:07:27,736
[SPEAKER_46]: We don't know how much it's gonna cost, but we can't handle the schools, the roads, all of our utilities.

1489
02:07:27,776 --> 02:07:29,857
[SPEAKER_46]: We have a lot of work to do on them already.

1490
02:07:29,977 --> 02:07:31,357
[SPEAKER_46]: We should be focusing on that.

1491
02:07:31,557 --> 02:07:38,159
[SPEAKER_46]: And the residents of Medford should know exactly how these proposed changes are gonna impact our city.

1492
02:07:38,599 --> 02:07:42,500
[SPEAKER_46]: And our leaders should be prepared to answer questions on that.

1493
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:44,961
[SPEAKER_46]: and handle whatever changes are there.

1494
02:07:45,622 --> 02:07:51,546
[SPEAKER_46]: Finally, I just want to say that these zoning changes have a real threat to our historical identity.

1495
02:07:52,346 --> 02:07:54,608
[SPEAKER_46]: There's massive environmental consequences.

1496
02:07:55,228 --> 02:07:58,530
[SPEAKER_58]: And as other people have said- I'm going to have to go ahead and mute you.

1497
02:07:58,550 --> 02:08:01,172
[SPEAKER_58]: You're about a minute and 20 seconds over.

1498
02:08:01,492 --> 02:08:04,074
[SPEAKER_58]: But if you have additional comments, please share them via email.

1499
02:08:04,294 --> 02:08:04,594
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

1500
02:08:07,190 --> 02:08:12,074
[SPEAKER_58]: The next commenter that we're going to have is Zoom.

1501
02:08:12,314 --> 02:08:14,436
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to do Avery Mangum.

1502
02:08:17,278 --> 02:08:17,859
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi, Avery.

1503
02:08:17,899 --> 02:08:19,720
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm going to go ahead and send you a request to unmute.

1504
02:08:21,181 --> 02:08:21,361
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi.

1505
02:08:22,702 --> 02:08:25,184
[SPEAKER_34]: My name is Avery, 14 Fairfield Street.

1506
02:08:25,605 --> 02:08:26,485
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm 21 years old.

1507
02:08:26,625 --> 02:08:33,230
[SPEAKER_34]: I've lived in Medford for eight years, and I currently live in a single-family home in land that is marked to be rezoned as urban residential one.

1508
02:08:34,436 --> 02:08:36,057
[SPEAKER_34]: on one side of a split street, actually.

1509
02:08:36,838 --> 02:08:40,960
[SPEAKER_34]: This means that homes like the one I live in will not be able to be built where I live in the future.

1510
02:08:40,980 --> 02:08:46,064
[SPEAKER_34]: And if I knock down my current house, a two-family unit at the minimum would need to replace it.

1511
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:53,385
[SPEAKER_34]: Now, I think it would be very easy for someone in my position to become defensive about this rezoning proposal.

1512
02:08:53,926 --> 02:08:58,950
[SPEAKER_34]: It guarantees that the land that I live on will not be used the same way in the future, and that's scary.

1513
02:08:59,631 --> 02:09:04,635
[SPEAKER_34]: But instead of becoming defensive and trying to put a stop to this change, I want to make a point to do the opposite.

1514
02:09:06,168 --> 02:09:13,833
[SPEAKER_34]: I am here tonight to give my full-throated endorsement of this rezoning proposal as a resident, taxpayer, young person, and single-family occupant in Medford.

1515
02:09:14,454 --> 02:09:23,921
[SPEAKER_34]: I am here to do this not because I seek to preserve my current lifestyle for generations to come, but because I want to do better than we are now, for my own descendants, and for the city that I live in and that I love.

1516
02:09:25,263 --> 02:09:27,904
[SPEAKER_34]: All across the United States, the story is the same.

1517
02:09:28,384 --> 02:09:32,205
[SPEAKER_34]: Higher density housing is a tremendous benefit to the city that builds it.

1518
02:09:32,725 --> 02:09:41,708
[SPEAKER_34]: It lowers housing costs, makes the city more attractive to move to for old and young alike, makes for stronger and more personable neighborhoods, and brings business to the city.

1519
02:09:42,428 --> 02:09:46,071
[SPEAKER_34]: Yet all across these United States, proposals like this one face opposition.

1520
02:09:46,692 --> 02:09:52,997
[SPEAKER_34]: Opposition out of what I think is a genuine, but ultimately misguided fear of changing the standards that we've become accustomed to.

1521
02:09:54,298 --> 02:10:06,028
[SPEAKER_34]: Precedent tells us that those cities that succeed over this fear and commit higher density zoning to law rise above the rest, and the dividends are paid to every resident and visitor to the city for decades to come.

1522
02:10:06,888 --> 02:10:09,009
[SPEAKER_34]: I want this for MedFood, the city that I love.

1523
02:10:09,569 --> 02:10:14,591
[SPEAKER_34]: MedFood was incorporated a city in 1892, and I say it's time we start building like one.

1524
02:10:15,471 --> 02:10:15,792
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1525
02:10:17,752 --> 02:10:18,413
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Avery.

1526
02:10:19,133 --> 02:10:20,893
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go back to in-person commenters.

1527
02:10:24,515 --> 02:10:29,377
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Danielle Marcellino, Patrick Clerkin, Heidi Sutherland,

1528
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:41,380
[SPEAKER_50]: Danielle Marcellino, 11 Spencer Road.

1529
02:10:41,461 --> 02:10:43,742
[SPEAKER_50]: I'm also the union president for the Metro Fire Department.

1530
02:10:46,845 --> 02:10:51,789
[SPEAKER_50]: I would assume that no matter what stance you take on this issue, your personal safety will always be a top priority.

1531
02:10:52,670 --> 02:11:00,577
[SPEAKER_50]: I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that the police officers and firefighters are probably the only ones in the city who go to work every day with a regard for their own safety for the sake of our citizens.

1532
02:11:01,759 --> 02:11:09,617
[SPEAKER_50]: So to be this far into the zoning conversation, but are only just beginning to reach out to public safety department heads for the discussion, makes it seem like safety is an afterthought.

1533
02:11:10,669 --> 02:11:13,031
[SPEAKER_50]: The fire chief and the department have serious concerns.

1534
02:11:13,532 --> 02:11:28,147
[SPEAKER_50]: A couple of key points to keep in mind are that the fire department does not have enough personnel working every day, sorry, working on shift every day to safely respond to what we would consider a medium hazard and a high hazard according to the fire safety standards.

1535
02:11:28,508 --> 02:11:32,552
[SPEAKER_50]: That would mean three-story multi-unit buildings and four-story or above as a high rise.

1536
02:11:33,875 --> 02:11:37,340
[SPEAKER_50]: We also do not have a fire engine in surface on Salem Street.

1537
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:47,374
[SPEAKER_50]: That means that if your house is on if your house is on Salem Street and on fire, that area's first crew of firefighters that show up do not have water or hoses to put the fire out.

1538
02:11:47,895 --> 02:11:50,338
[SPEAKER_50]: You unfortunately have to wait for crews from another area to

1539
02:11:52,798 --> 02:11:55,899
[SPEAKER_50]: Sorry, I can't read this small.

1540
02:11:55,919 --> 02:11:59,139
[SPEAKER_50]: You unfortunately have to wait for crews from another area.

1541
02:11:59,220 --> 02:12:02,040
[SPEAKER_50]: And if you have ever seen a house fire, it grows exponentially every second.

1542
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:07,281
[SPEAKER_50]: Increasing the population and density of the neighborhoods will impact our response to emergencies.

1543
02:12:07,842 --> 02:12:11,342
[SPEAKER_50]: Basically, this plan will spread fire department resources too thin.

1544
02:12:12,003 --> 02:12:22,185
[SPEAKER_50]: If you have any interest in what's good for the community, you will slow the freight train down and allow the safety professionals time to properly evaluate the impacts of this plan and fortify our resources before it actually comes to fruition.

1545
02:12:22,946 --> 02:12:23,207
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you.

1546
02:12:23,809 --> 02:12:24,351
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Danielle.

1547
02:12:38,807 --> 02:12:40,548
[SPEAKER_49]: Patrick Clerkin, 50 Princeton Street.

1548
02:12:41,568 --> 02:12:50,172
[SPEAKER_49]: And I wanted to focus on some actionable proposals for how this process might be smooth for the board, the council, the public, pretty much all the stakeholders.

1549
02:12:50,612 --> 02:12:52,693
[SPEAKER_49]: So we've already heard about the pace of the process.

1550
02:12:53,353 --> 02:12:55,594
[SPEAKER_49]: Another piece is the presentation of information.

1551
02:12:55,614 --> 02:12:59,076
[SPEAKER_49]: One of the things that comes to mind is anytime there are maps like that,

1552
02:12:59,596 --> 02:13:13,733
[SPEAKER_49]: really calling out in red line form the differences between the two versions of the maps will really help because it's very difficult to look at two maps where a lot of things have changed and wrap your head around what exactly is going on and what's different between the two images.

1553
02:13:14,614 --> 02:13:17,958
[SPEAKER_49]: The second thing is the different zoning codes.

1554
02:13:18,098 --> 02:13:19,680
[SPEAKER_49]: There's the old code, the new code.

1555
02:13:20,708 --> 02:13:31,291
[SPEAKER_49]: I think it would help to have a diagram that really visually conveys the transition from one taxonomy to another taxonomy, like what merged, what split, what was added, what's the same.

1556
02:13:31,732 --> 02:13:35,673
[SPEAKER_49]: It's difficult when you have two different vocabularies, basically, and you're trying to compare the two.

1557
02:13:36,693 --> 02:13:39,294
[SPEAKER_49]: The third is the website is generally pretty good.

1558
02:13:39,334 --> 02:13:49,798
[SPEAKER_49]: I was actually scrolling through it, but I would say that really reassessing, having someone look at it and just de-jargoning anything, particularly headlines.

1559
02:13:49,858 --> 02:13:55,740
[SPEAKER_49]: I think that for the most part, it's good, but there's still some things out there that someone might look through it and say, what is this?

1560
02:13:56,080 --> 02:13:59,782
[SPEAKER_49]: And plus some of the things within the tabs are kind of text walls.

1561
02:13:59,862 --> 02:14:02,583
[SPEAKER_49]: People don't really like to delve into those often.

1562
02:14:03,123 --> 02:14:04,064
[SPEAKER_49]: it's a lot easier to do that.

1563
02:14:04,084 --> 02:14:05,004
[SPEAKER_49]: So visuals certainly help.

1564
02:14:05,024 --> 02:14:08,946
[SPEAKER_49]: And then the third category of item is just aligning incentives.

1565
02:14:09,466 --> 02:14:20,512
[SPEAKER_49]: So I would say that anyone who has possibly anyone who has a property along the edge of a thoroughfare where we would be building taller buildings naturally, that's where you would put more

1566
02:14:26,635 --> 02:14:27,455
[SPEAKER_49]: would have their property taxes decreased.

1567
02:14:27,475 --> 02:14:39,339
[SPEAKER_49]: Um anyone who was right next to the tall buildings would have their property taxes decreased because they're losing the value of their of their homes and basically phasing out towards pretty much the edge of the shadow of the building.

1568
02:14:39,719 --> 02:14:44,100
[SPEAKER_49]: The properties in the immediate area would have their property taxes decreased as well.

1569
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:51,342
[SPEAKER_49]: So that would align the city's incentives with the residents incentives, so they would basically think twice about having really tall buildings.

1570
02:14:51,462 --> 02:14:51,803
[SPEAKER_49]: They gain

1571
02:14:56,565 --> 02:14:57,110
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Patrick.

1572
02:15:02,925 --> 02:15:03,385
[SPEAKER_62]: Good evening.

1573
02:15:03,485 --> 02:15:04,386
[SPEAKER_62]: I'm Heidi Sutherland.

1574
02:15:04,486 --> 02:15:05,647
[SPEAKER_62]: I'm at 66 St.

1575
02:15:05,687 --> 02:15:08,748
[SPEAKER_62]: James Road, which is on the Budweiser side of the Fellsway.

1576
02:15:10,829 --> 02:15:14,251
[SPEAKER_62]: I came here specifically just to listen and see what was going on.

1577
02:15:14,711 --> 02:15:16,492
[SPEAKER_62]: Trying to see these maps on Facebook.

1578
02:15:16,572 --> 02:15:17,473
[SPEAKER_62]: They don't blow up enough.

1579
02:15:17,513 --> 02:15:18,653
[SPEAKER_62]: You can't really see anything.

1580
02:15:18,673 --> 02:15:19,274
[SPEAKER_62]: It's useless.

1581
02:15:20,534 --> 02:15:28,799
[SPEAKER_62]: But listening to a lot of my neighbors and concerns that they're having, I was a housing advocate for six years in Boston.

1582
02:15:28,999 --> 02:15:31,120
[SPEAKER_62]: I worked with homeless, low-income people

1583
02:15:32,566 --> 02:15:35,007
[SPEAKER_62]: affordable housing is an oxymoron.

1584
02:15:35,447 --> 02:15:36,747
[SPEAKER_62]: There's no two ways about it.

1585
02:15:37,607 --> 02:15:51,450
[SPEAKER_62]: If you look at the HUD website right now, the area median income for MedFed is $118,000, which under normal circumstances would be a two person income.

1586
02:15:52,691 --> 02:15:58,092
[SPEAKER_62]: My daughter and her fiance can't afford to live

1587
02:15:59,109 --> 02:15:59,709
[SPEAKER_62]: in Medford.

1588
02:16:00,289 --> 02:16:04,111
[SPEAKER_62]: They are above this area median income combined.

1589
02:16:04,571 --> 02:16:08,972
[SPEAKER_62]: They had to buy a house out in Tewksbury at 600 square feet.

1590
02:16:10,253 --> 02:16:11,113
[SPEAKER_62]: They can't afford this.

1591
02:16:11,213 --> 02:16:12,353
[SPEAKER_62]: They looked everywhere.

1592
02:16:13,354 --> 02:16:15,374
[SPEAKER_62]: She would rather be down here with her family.

1593
02:16:15,874 --> 02:16:20,396
[SPEAKER_62]: I live in the house that my grandfather built that my mother grew up in on St.

1594
02:16:20,436 --> 02:16:21,116
[SPEAKER_62]: James Road.

1595
02:16:21,856 --> 02:16:23,457
[SPEAKER_62]: To my neighbor over on Park Street,

1596
02:16:25,107 --> 02:16:27,868
[SPEAKER_62]: resident parking only, make sure it's 24 hours.

1597
02:16:27,928 --> 02:16:31,670
[SPEAKER_62]: And even then, if the police can't get down there to police it, it's not gonna help.

1598
02:16:33,071 --> 02:16:38,534
[SPEAKER_62]: To my neighbor who was the realtor, great, I applaud her tremendously.

1599
02:16:38,914 --> 02:16:42,416
[SPEAKER_62]: There's a lot of problems with the proposal in general.

1600
02:16:42,856 --> 02:16:48,478
[SPEAKER_62]: I wish I had answers, but it's just, there's too many things wrong with it, that it really needs to,

1601
02:16:49,559 --> 02:16:50,580
[SPEAKER_62]: that we're going to be able to.

1602
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:54,523
[SPEAKER_62]: Put more focus in individually, break them out into separate pieces.

1603
02:16:54,703 --> 02:17:00,027
[SPEAKER_62]: Don't lump the residential zoning in with the E. D. U. Zoning to rush it through.

1604
02:17:00,527 --> 02:17:01,808
[SPEAKER_62]: Take it piece by piece.

1605
02:17:01,968 --> 02:17:03,769
[SPEAKER_62]: It's the only way that things are going to work.

1606
02:17:03,989 --> 02:17:06,771
[SPEAKER_62]: Well some of my neighbors like what has been

1607
02:17:13,534 --> 02:17:14,655
[SPEAKER_62]: is impossible.

1608
02:17:15,576 --> 02:17:17,158
[SPEAKER_62]: I'm right by the gas station.

1609
02:17:17,478 --> 02:17:19,240
[SPEAKER_62]: People just rush by on the Fells Way.

1610
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,521
[SPEAKER_62]: They don't want to let you out.

1611
02:17:21,141 --> 02:17:23,664
[SPEAKER_62]: As far as my street, we've got a nice little bend on it.

1612
02:17:24,064 --> 02:17:28,188
[SPEAKER_62]: The fire truck has a hard time getting down there if everybody's parked.

1613
02:17:28,528 --> 02:17:29,810
[SPEAKER_62]: We're one-sided parking.

1614
02:17:30,050 --> 02:17:31,131
[SPEAKER_62]: We're a two-way street.

1615
02:17:31,771 --> 02:17:39,038
[SPEAKER_62]: I can't park facing the wrong way on my street because it's not deemed on the other side that it's one-way parking.

1616
02:17:39,779 --> 02:17:47,482
[SPEAKER_62]: there's a park in front of my house, my neighbors, and I just found out tonight that my mother received a phone call from a realtor looking to buy the house.

1617
02:17:47,722 --> 02:17:49,282
[SPEAKER_62]: Heidi, I'm going to ask you to wrap up your comment.

1618
02:17:49,442 --> 02:17:50,322
[SPEAKER_62]: Not a problem at all.

1619
02:17:50,382 --> 02:17:50,663
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you.

1620
02:17:50,723 --> 02:18:00,766
[SPEAKER_62]: I just wanted to say I really have concerns as one of the young people, younger people in the city that you're driving, you're going to wind up driving people out.

1621
02:18:00,886 --> 02:18:06,168
[SPEAKER_62]: It's not going to be a good thing, contrary to what the young folk on the Zoom had to say.

1622
02:18:06,708 --> 02:18:07,128
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Heidi.

1623
02:18:12,779 --> 02:18:14,841
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go back to Zoom commenters.

1624
02:18:15,962 --> 02:18:18,164
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Daniel Nezo Mueller.

1625
02:18:23,168 --> 02:18:24,689
[SPEAKER_58]: Daniel, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

1626
02:18:24,709 --> 02:18:27,412
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

1627
02:18:27,592 --> 02:18:30,334
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much for taking my comment.

1628
02:18:31,435 --> 02:18:39,662
[SPEAKER_25]: I would just like to propose that possibly we could look into limiting the number of

1629
02:18:42,625 --> 02:19:04,203
[SPEAKER_25]: properties that can be up-zoned in a given year, just throwing out a number, possibly 5% of the total stock that has a change of zoning, just to help offer a solution that meets the needs of both parties, both people who want to change the zoning and people who would like to stay.

1630
02:19:04,223 --> 02:19:07,986
[SPEAKER_58]: I'd ask that people who are having separate conversations, please move them to outside the chambers.

1631
02:19:08,446 --> 02:19:08,746
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

1632
02:19:11,634 --> 02:19:12,855
[SPEAKER_58]: Sorry, Daniel, please continue.

1633
02:19:13,676 --> 02:19:14,016
[SPEAKER_25]: No worries.

1634
02:19:16,017 --> 02:19:34,869
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I mean, I would like to echo Patrick's suggestions that we find a good compromise between both sides, both being able to slow down the pace, but also allow us to advance as a city and move forward with, you know, new opportunities.

1635
02:19:35,229 --> 02:19:35,890
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

1636
02:19:39,352 --> 02:19:39,932
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Daniel.

1637
02:19:39,952 --> 02:19:40,933
[SPEAKER_58]: Appreciate the comment.

1638
02:19:43,118 --> 02:19:47,088
[SPEAKER_58]: We have in-person commenters, Tom Knackle and Harrison Green.

1639
02:20:00,986 --> 02:20:03,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, good evening, Tom Nackel.

1640
02:20:03,727 --> 02:20:04,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Tom.

1641
02:20:04,487 --> 02:20:12,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Homeowner for 14 years at 1 Vernon Street and lifelong resident of West Medford.

1642
02:20:13,409 --> 02:20:16,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I have several suggestions.

1643
02:20:17,890 --> 02:20:29,372
[SPEAKER_08]: One is, this is quite a proposal, and I believe that it should not go through seven members

1644
02:20:29,612 --> 02:20:42,151
[SPEAKER_08]: of the community, but through all the members in the vote on the ballot, not just the council members.

1645
02:20:43,333 --> 02:20:45,035
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it does pass,

1646
02:20:46,515 --> 02:21:00,398
[SPEAKER_08]: there should be some compensation to the single family homeowners because it's a quality of life issue and a monetary issue.

1647
02:21:00,418 --> 02:21:14,382
[SPEAKER_08]: The loss of quality of life and as someone else said earlier, if you build a multifamily building across from a single family house,

1648
02:21:15,142 --> 02:21:20,448
[SPEAKER_08]: there is a loss in the value of your home.

1649
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:23,392
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should be considered.

1650
02:21:23,412 --> 02:21:30,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And is the developer or the city going to compensate you for that loss?

1651
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:31,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1652
02:21:31,641 --> 02:21:33,983
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Tom.

1653
02:21:39,904 --> 02:21:41,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Harrison Green.

1654
02:21:41,686 --> 02:21:43,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Harrison.

1655
02:21:43,467 --> 02:21:44,889
[SPEAKER_02]: To Ronaleigh Road in West Medford.

1656
02:21:46,070 --> 02:21:50,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lucky enough to own roughly 30% of a single family home in West Medford.

1657
02:21:50,674 --> 02:21:56,340
[SPEAKER_02]: If my neighborhood allowed for multi-unit developments, it's possible I would have been able to be a part of this community earlier.

1658
02:21:57,362 --> 02:21:59,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford is now a majority renter city.

1659
02:22:00,484 --> 02:22:13,831
[SPEAKER_02]: If this board is concerned about getting public comment from all residents, I suggest it makes an effort to consider the needs beyond the majority homeowners like myself, who can attend multiple Wednesday night meetings in the middle of an affordability crisis.

1660
02:22:15,432 --> 02:22:23,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also like to acknowledge how unusual it is for our mayor to drum up division on the basis of not understanding the map and because of five to 10 emails a day.

1661
02:22:24,757 --> 02:22:27,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We deserve better support from our chief executive.

1662
02:22:28,165 --> 02:22:34,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, there have been many comments tonight about redevelopers flipping houses for over a million dollars.

1663
02:22:35,811 --> 02:22:41,336
[SPEAKER_02]: This could begin to be addressed by the proposed real estate transfer fee to fund an affordable housing trust.

1664
02:22:41,997 --> 02:22:49,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see the community pursue solutions rather than slowdowns with no solutions to the issues our neighbors are facing.

1665
02:22:49,703 --> 02:22:51,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I urge the board to adopt the proposal.

1666
02:22:51,845 --> 02:22:52,185
Thank you.

1667
02:22:53,586 --> 02:22:54,207
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Harrison.

1668
02:22:57,374 --> 02:22:58,796
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go back to Zoom commenters.

1669
02:22:59,096 --> 02:23:00,057
[SPEAKER_58]: We have T.M.

1670
02:23:00,337 --> 02:23:00,778
[SPEAKER_58]: Hanley.

1671
02:23:00,798 --> 02:23:04,542
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

1672
02:23:05,922 --> 02:23:06,762
[SPEAKER_61]: Hi, good evening.

1673
02:23:06,822 --> 02:23:07,522
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you so much.

1674
02:23:07,562 --> 02:23:09,983
[SPEAKER_61]: And I want to thank everybody else who spoke before me.

1675
02:23:10,623 --> 02:23:12,924
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm a lifelong resident of Playstead Road.

1676
02:23:13,584 --> 02:23:21,126
[SPEAKER_61]: I was thinking my next move would only be across the street to the cemetery, but I feel I'm being pushed out now sooner than I wanted.

1677
02:23:21,146 --> 02:23:22,666
[SPEAKER_61]: I do agree.

1678
02:23:23,186 --> 02:23:24,687
[SPEAKER_61]: I was here to say slow down.

1679
02:23:24,847 --> 02:23:28,407
[SPEAKER_61]: However, now listening, my thoughts are reject.

1680
02:23:28,728 --> 02:23:30,048
[SPEAKER_61]: Please, I'm rejecting this.

1681
02:23:30,748 --> 02:23:34,552
[SPEAKER_61]: The infrastructure is in dire need of an assessment.

1682
02:23:34,852 --> 02:23:39,317
[SPEAKER_61]: And if we do not have that prior to this, everything will be broken.

1683
02:23:39,337 --> 02:23:41,980
[SPEAKER_61]: We'll be back to like, I don't know where we'll be at.

1684
02:23:42,761 --> 02:23:46,144
[SPEAKER_61]: And it shouldn't be on the homeowners to support everything.

1685
02:23:47,225 --> 02:23:49,066
[SPEAKER_61]: So please, I'm rejecting.

1686
02:23:49,546 --> 02:23:53,408
[SPEAKER_61]: I do want to say that Chris Lavoie, you have the best saying of the night.

1687
02:23:54,029 --> 02:23:55,569
[SPEAKER_61]: We're not in a housing crisis.

1688
02:23:56,049 --> 02:23:59,171
[SPEAKER_61]: We're in a desirability crisis.

1689
02:23:59,611 --> 02:24:00,932
[SPEAKER_61]: That's where we find ourselves.

1690
02:24:01,472 --> 02:24:07,235
[SPEAKER_61]: So I'm thinking permit incentives, ADU, and no more banks.

1691
02:24:07,575 --> 02:24:07,995
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

1692
02:24:08,015 --> 02:24:11,117
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

1693
02:24:20,970 --> 02:24:24,711
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go to our next commenter, Eric Bastien.

1694
02:24:25,852 --> 02:24:27,412
[SPEAKER_58]: Eric, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

1695
02:24:31,774 --> 02:24:33,035
[SPEAKER_58]: If you're talking, I can't hear you.

1696
02:24:38,697 --> 02:24:40,277
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm going to go ahead and request an unmute again.

1697
02:24:41,958 --> 02:24:42,778
[SPEAKER_66]: Sorry, can you hear me now?

1698
02:24:43,018 --> 02:24:43,979
[SPEAKER_58]: I can hear you now, yes.

1699
02:24:43,999 --> 02:24:44,579
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, thank you.

1700
02:24:45,748 --> 02:24:55,310
[SPEAKER_66]: Hi, my name is Eric, and I currently live on Morton Ave in South Medford, and I'm here to strongly support this rezoning proposal.

1701
02:24:56,130 --> 02:25:06,973
[SPEAKER_66]: I think we've heard just about every classic NIMBY argument tonight, but at the end of the day, they all amount to denying basic economics, that increasing supply

1702
02:25:08,554 --> 02:25:12,117
[SPEAKER_66]: in the face of increased demand, lowers the market clearing rate.

1703
02:25:12,377 --> 02:25:18,122
[SPEAKER_66]: Therefore, housing becomes more affordable for everyone if you build more of it and allow more types of it to be built.

1704
02:25:19,042 --> 02:25:20,864
[SPEAKER_66]: Medford isn't actually in a vacuum.

1705
02:25:21,785 --> 02:25:24,027
[SPEAKER_66]: We are in an affordability crisis.

1706
02:25:24,147 --> 02:25:25,548
[SPEAKER_66]: However, it is not just Medford.

1707
02:25:25,708 --> 02:25:28,611
[SPEAKER_66]: It is a regional affordability crisis.

1708
02:25:29,111 --> 02:25:33,335
[SPEAKER_66]: You cannot treat homes both as investment vehicles and as essential shelter.

1709
02:25:33,595 --> 02:25:34,496
[SPEAKER_66]: You must pick one.

1710
02:25:35,016 --> 02:25:38,862
[SPEAKER_66]: And right now, all the voices I'm hearing are choosing investment vehicles.

1711
02:25:39,763 --> 02:25:47,294
[SPEAKER_66]: Some argue we should slow down, but I believe that's the same line to use to avoid action on everything from climate to gun legislation.

1712
02:25:48,015 --> 02:25:49,397
[SPEAKER_66]: Delay is a form of denial.

1713
02:25:49,938 --> 02:25:51,319
[SPEAKER_66]: And let's be honest about the parking complaints.

1714
02:25:51,599 --> 02:25:53,260
[SPEAKER_66]: Parking is artificially cheap.

1715
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,381
[SPEAKER_66]: If it's scarce, price it accordingly.

1716
02:25:55,701 --> 02:26:00,704
[SPEAKER_66]: Do not use public funds to subsidize private car storage while people can't afford to live here.

1717
02:26:01,385 --> 02:26:03,626
[SPEAKER_66]: I first moved to Medford because it was affordable.

1718
02:26:03,786 --> 02:26:05,847
[SPEAKER_66]: About 13 years ago, I was a renter.

1719
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:09,429
[SPEAKER_66]: I left because I found more exciting places to live.

1720
02:26:09,910 --> 02:26:15,973
[SPEAKER_66]: I moved back because new development and more density made it affordable as well as desirable to live again.

1721
02:26:16,273 --> 02:26:18,335
[SPEAKER_66]: And it's now my favorite place I've ever lived.

1722
02:26:19,535 --> 02:26:26,981
[SPEAKER_66]: Rezoning is a long game, and zoning changes take decades to meaningfully shift to on-the-ground changes in housing and infrastructure.

1723
02:26:27,381 --> 02:26:34,647
[SPEAKER_66]: Construction is slow and expensive, and if we do not act now, we are locking in failure for an entire generation.

1724
02:26:35,087 --> 02:26:42,313
[SPEAKER_66]: Lastly, the loudest voices at meetings like this often represent current landowners, not renters, new residents, or future families.

1725
02:26:43,032 --> 02:26:50,756
[SPEAKER_66]: I urge the Community Development Board to resist making nostalgia or property values for, mistaking nostalgia or property values for moral arguments.

1726
02:26:51,357 --> 02:26:52,397
[SPEAKER_66]: Please pass this rezoning.

1727
02:26:52,757 --> 02:26:54,018
[SPEAKER_66]: Medford's future depends on it.

1728
02:26:54,318 --> 02:26:54,658
[SPEAKER_66]: Thank you.

1729
02:26:56,519 --> 02:26:57,140
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Eric.

1730
02:27:04,304 --> 02:27:06,305
[SPEAKER_58]: Our next commenter is Cynthia Kuhn.

1731
02:27:10,567 --> 02:27:12,128
[SPEAKER_58]: Cynthia, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

1732
02:27:17,123 --> 02:27:17,823
[SPEAKER_58]: Cynthia, are you there?

1733
02:27:18,484 --> 02:27:19,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, can you hear me?

1734
02:27:20,505 --> 02:27:21,325
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes, thank you.

1735
02:27:23,026 --> 02:27:25,128
[SPEAKER_13]: I live at 602 High Street.

1736
02:27:25,888 --> 02:27:37,114
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in a single family house that is on this plan is scheduled to be an urban residential one.

1737
02:27:38,415 --> 02:27:42,898
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm concerned about traffic because there already is

1738
02:27:43,758 --> 02:27:49,520
[SPEAKER_13]: quite a bit of traffic during rush hour down along High Street.

1739
02:27:50,560 --> 02:28:06,204
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm concerned about climate change because the effect of increased density will also increase more urban heat islands and I

1740
02:28:08,725 --> 02:28:10,487
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very concerned about that.

1741
02:28:11,247 --> 02:28:26,338
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm also concerned about the mayor's statement about the fact that our schools are filling up.

1742
02:28:26,819 --> 02:28:28,520
[SPEAKER_13]: And until we have a plan for

1743
02:28:34,624 --> 02:28:40,087
[SPEAKER_13]: um, having more schools that will accommodate more people.

1744
02:28:41,368 --> 02:28:45,990
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it would be very, very unwise to go ahead with this plan.

1745
02:28:46,930 --> 02:28:47,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1746
02:28:50,172 --> 02:28:50,872
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Cynthia.

1747
02:28:52,573 --> 02:28:57,996
[SPEAKER_58]: Our next zoom commenter is iPhone with two eyes.

1748
02:28:58,936 --> 02:29:02,758
[SPEAKER_58]: Just a reminder to state your name and address before you go into your public comment.

1749
02:29:08,195 --> 02:29:10,856
[SPEAKER_58]: I have sent iPhone with two eyes a request to unmute.

1750
02:29:10,876 --> 02:29:22,939
[SPEAKER_58]: All right, I'm gonna keep moving on to Zoom commenters.

1751
02:29:24,419 --> 02:29:27,900
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Ellen Lavecchia.

1752
02:29:30,580 --> 02:29:33,081
[SPEAKER_58]: Ellen, I'm gonna send you an unmute.

1753
02:29:36,578 --> 02:29:38,263
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay.

1754
02:29:38,303 --> 02:29:38,924
[SPEAKER_53]: Hi, can you hear me?

1755
02:29:39,707 --> 02:29:39,927
[SPEAKER_53]: Yes.

1756
02:29:40,027 --> 02:29:40,308
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

1757
02:29:41,178 --> 02:29:41,578
[SPEAKER_53]: Hi.

1758
02:29:41,599 --> 02:29:46,843
[SPEAKER_53]: Yeah, so I want to make sort of a different point that I haven't heard yet.

1759
02:29:47,224 --> 02:29:53,209
[SPEAKER_53]: And that is just with the kind of need for variation across the city.

1760
02:29:53,650 --> 02:29:59,295
[SPEAKER_53]: I lived in a two-family home in a zone for two-family and three-family homes.

1761
02:30:00,316 --> 02:30:02,738
[SPEAKER_53]: My family grew, my needs changed.

1762
02:30:02,758 --> 02:30:05,961
[SPEAKER_53]: I was able to stay in Medford and move into a single-family home.

1763
02:30:06,962 --> 02:30:13,115
[SPEAKER_53]: I hope someday I will move back when my kids are grown into an apartment style living.

1764
02:30:13,956 --> 02:30:17,804
[SPEAKER_53]: I can do all of that in Medford today, when that time comes 20 years from now.

1765
02:30:19,025 --> 02:30:29,147
[SPEAKER_53]: My neighbors will have all for the most part have turned over 20 to 30 over the course of 20 to 30 years and they will have sold to a developer because that will be the highest bidder.

1766
02:30:29,768 --> 02:30:33,889
[SPEAKER_53]: So my current single family neighborhood will have turned into a multifamily neighborhood.

1767
02:30:34,849 --> 02:30:39,210
[SPEAKER_53]: There will be no variation across the city for different needs of different families.

1768
02:30:39,842 --> 02:30:43,626
[SPEAKER_53]: all of the neighborhoods will look and feel the same.

1769
02:30:44,326 --> 02:30:45,968
[SPEAKER_53]: It will be one size fits all.

1770
02:30:46,508 --> 02:31:00,461
[SPEAKER_53]: If there is only one type of family or one set of needs that can be accommodated in Medford instead of various sets of needs, which is what we can do today for different sizes of families and different needs of families.

1771
02:31:06,426 --> 02:31:12,150
[SPEAKER_53]: When I do move and my entire neighborhood, single family neighborhood is no longer a single family neighborhood.

1772
02:31:12,170 --> 02:31:16,552
[SPEAKER_53]: And none of the single family neighborhoods are single family neighborhoods.

1773
02:31:17,693 --> 02:31:30,581
[SPEAKER_53]: My question for you today is, at what point are you issuing, at what point are you issuing the residents our uniforms?

1774
02:31:34,463 --> 02:31:35,764
[SPEAKER_53]: Are you gonna send us out uniforms?

1775
02:31:38,247 --> 02:31:39,307
[SPEAKER_53]: do we all have to be the same?

1776
02:31:39,648 --> 02:31:40,668
[SPEAKER_53]: We all have to be the same.

1777
02:31:40,688 --> 02:31:42,089
[SPEAKER_53]: We all have to have the same needs.

1778
02:31:42,669 --> 02:31:43,989
[SPEAKER_53]: That's your question.

1779
02:31:44,089 --> 02:31:47,271
[SPEAKER_58]: At what point are we issuing the residents uniforms?

1780
02:31:47,411 --> 02:31:47,731
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1781
02:31:48,591 --> 02:31:50,452
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay.

1782
02:31:51,112 --> 02:31:52,513
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm just clarifying with the commenter.

1783
02:31:52,533 --> 02:31:54,594
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm not asking for comment from the chairs.

1784
02:31:54,634 --> 02:31:55,034
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

1785
02:31:56,114 --> 02:31:56,374
[SPEAKER_58]: Great.

1786
02:31:56,835 --> 02:32:00,196
[SPEAKER_53]: Yeah, you can if you can let us all know that that would be great.

1787
02:32:01,016 --> 02:32:01,257
[SPEAKER_58]: Great.

1788
02:32:01,317 --> 02:32:01,617
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

1789
02:32:01,637 --> 02:32:02,377
[SPEAKER_58]: I appreciate your comment.

1790
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:11,022
[SPEAKER_58]: Our next commenter is Christian Petrillo.

1791
02:32:15,444 --> 02:32:16,185
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey, thank you.

1792
02:32:16,205 --> 02:32:19,506
[SPEAKER_30]: This is Christian Petrillo, 19 Wellgate Road in Medford.

1793
02:32:20,867 --> 02:32:25,769
[SPEAKER_30]: Grew up in the city, born and raised, have also contributed to some developments in the city.

1794
02:32:26,750 --> 02:32:32,693
[SPEAKER_30]: Medford, as it's currently served, has not had their zoning changed in a number of years.

1795
02:32:33,453 --> 02:32:40,454
[SPEAKER_30]: squares are dying, if not for cell phone stores and, you know, convenience stores and nail salons.

1796
02:32:41,315 --> 02:33:00,959
[SPEAKER_30]: What we need is kind of an upwardly mobile future look towards the city of, you know, invigorating our squares, activating the streetscapes, allowing for density to incorporate affordable housing so it is affordable for all.

1797
02:33:01,719 --> 02:33:04,020
[SPEAKER_30]: you know, the spectrum of residents of the city.

1798
02:33:04,060 --> 02:33:05,180
[SPEAKER_30]: The city is growing.

1799
02:33:05,701 --> 02:33:13,044
[SPEAKER_30]: When I hear of concerns of people of parking and services, obviously some of those are not in line with development.

1800
02:33:13,084 --> 02:33:17,966
[SPEAKER_30]: They're budgetary shortfalls or whatever they may be, but they should grow with development.

1801
02:33:18,186 --> 02:33:23,288
[SPEAKER_30]: Development spurs a tax base that also contributes to the budgets.

1802
02:33:24,488 --> 02:33:29,433
[SPEAKER_30]: And, you know, what I hear a lot is from people who've owned for a long time.

1803
02:33:30,093 --> 02:33:41,724
[SPEAKER_30]: All those initial concerns are really unvoiced concerns of just adversity to change, adversity to not think forward for a time when they will not be here.

1804
02:33:43,385 --> 02:33:43,585
[SPEAKER_30]: Hello.

1805
02:33:49,349 --> 02:33:49,909
[SPEAKER_58]: Sorry about that.

1806
02:33:49,929 --> 02:33:52,210
[SPEAKER_58]: I forgot to mute a previous commenter.

1807
02:33:52,270 --> 02:33:57,813
[SPEAKER_30]: So, you know, this is, you know, we can't be afraid of change.

1808
02:33:57,833 --> 02:34:04,436
[SPEAKER_30]: We have to not just think about our own needs, but the needs of an ever evolving city and tax base.

1809
02:34:04,636 --> 02:34:06,037
[SPEAKER_30]: And there is a housing crisis.

1810
02:34:06,097 --> 02:34:09,659
[SPEAKER_30]: People can be in denial about it is a supply and demand.

1811
02:34:10,119 --> 02:34:11,260
[SPEAKER_30]: The more you supply.

1812
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:38,048
[SPEAKER_30]: hopefully you know it lessens the demand therefore you know helping the prices and affordability it's not people are going to come in and just create affordable housing inclusionary housing quotas uh you know help add to that as well as you know adding to an affordable housing trust stock and contributions so with that you know this is i think a plan that should be carefully looked at

1813
02:34:38,668 --> 02:34:56,563
[SPEAKER_30]: for density along the main thoroughfares to activate streetscapes, retail, to make it invigorating, great community, also while respecting the single family owners and the fabric of that neighborhood as any smart community growth and development should be.

1814
02:34:56,623 --> 02:35:05,311
[SPEAKER_30]: But we do need to look towards the future and we cannot be NIMBYs and only think of our own needs while we own housing and not for the people who are seeking housing.

1815
02:35:05,851 --> 02:35:06,132
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1816
02:35:07,623 --> 02:35:08,264
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Christian.

1817
02:35:08,284 --> 02:35:11,326
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go back to iPhone with two eyes.

1818
02:35:11,686 --> 02:35:13,128
[SPEAKER_58]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1819
02:35:20,794 --> 02:35:24,878
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm sending a request to unmute, but it doesn't seem to be going through.

1820
02:35:40,860 --> 02:35:45,382
[SPEAKER_58]: There might be a phone number that they can dial into if that's a tech workaround.

1821
02:35:47,443 --> 02:35:50,685
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go to the next Zoom commenter, which is Michael Dewberry.

1822
02:35:51,925 --> 02:35:54,266
[SPEAKER_58]: Michael, I'm going to go ahead and send a request to unmute.

1823
02:35:58,028 --> 02:35:59,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Michael Dewberry, Park Street.

1824
02:36:00,329 --> 02:36:01,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for taking my comment.

1825
02:36:01,350 --> 02:36:01,830
[SPEAKER_58]: It's very low.

1826
02:36:01,910 --> 02:36:03,891
[SPEAKER_58]: Can you speak louder or closer to your machine?

1827
02:36:06,152 --> 02:36:06,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that better?

1828
02:36:07,775 --> 02:36:15,716
[SPEAKER_58]: It's a little bit better, but just yell and pray for forgiveness from your housemates or neighbors.

1829
02:36:17,308 --> 02:36:20,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, so, um, Michael, do you bury 50 park street?

1830
02:36:20,691 --> 02:36:21,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, thank you for taking my comment.

1831
02:36:21,973 --> 02:36:23,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, sorry, I wasn't here earlier.

1832
02:36:23,494 --> 02:36:28,679
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is called for, uh, uh, I did wait until the end of the last meeting.

1833
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:35,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, actually, I think it's probably multiple meetings I've been at where I, uh, fell off the list because the meeting had to be adjourned.

1834
02:36:35,926 --> 02:36:38,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so, yeah, I'm happy to have a chance to speak briefly now.

1835
02:36:39,070 --> 02:36:40,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I just want to say that, um,

1836
02:36:42,083 --> 02:36:44,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm also glad to see that there are more people here.

1837
02:36:45,284 --> 02:36:47,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been late to things in the past.

1838
02:36:47,644 --> 02:36:50,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been to a bunch of these meetings, but I totally understand.

1839
02:36:50,725 --> 02:36:53,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're coming into this late and trying to catch up.

1840
02:36:53,646 --> 02:36:54,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I empathize that position.

1841
02:36:54,626 --> 02:37:00,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if we want to do things to

1842
02:37:01,973 --> 02:37:07,298
[SPEAKER_05]: improve the communication, figure out how do we explain what the purpose of this is to more people.

1843
02:37:07,338 --> 02:37:07,818
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

1844
02:37:08,439 --> 02:37:14,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I strongly support the current amended plan, and I'd like to see it moved forward.

1845
02:37:14,604 --> 02:37:20,629
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we have to do more communication around it, if there are targeted improvements that people have to suggest, I think that is also excellent.

1846
02:37:21,089 --> 02:37:22,790
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would urge the committee to stick to the

1847
02:37:23,651 --> 02:37:33,018
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, originally a democratically determined plan for, you know, we've been in this multi-year process with the comprehensive vision and the timelines you set out.

1848
02:37:33,198 --> 02:37:38,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I think extending it a little bit, you know, has already been agreed to makes total sense.

1849
02:37:38,742 --> 02:37:50,470
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's not, you know, weigh this down by, you know, procedural shenanigans when, you know, we kind of knew, you know, the last election, this is something we wanted to set out to do as a city.

1850
02:37:51,751 --> 02:37:54,473
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife and I are lucky enough to own our home, a single-family home.

1851
02:37:55,213 --> 02:37:56,775
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel very lucky to be able to do that.

1852
02:37:57,255 --> 02:37:59,076
[SPEAKER_05]: We are adjacent to a multifamily house.

1853
02:37:59,136 --> 02:38:01,018
[SPEAKER_05]: We are two doors down from a 10-unit building.

1854
02:38:01,678 --> 02:38:08,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not feel like my experience or the value of my home is at all impaired by proximity to multifamily.

1855
02:38:09,064 --> 02:38:15,387
[SPEAKER_05]: If the density around us suddenly increases, I don't think my life will be affected at all in any negative ways.

1856
02:38:15,427 --> 02:38:23,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it will be affected in positive ways because where I live in Glenwood, I haven't only been here about 10 years, but my understanding is that

1857
02:38:24,891 --> 02:38:31,993
[SPEAKER_05]: 30, 40 years ago, this was actually a much denser neighborhood with retail and restaurants threaded through the residential district.

1858
02:38:32,393 --> 02:38:40,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And the housing stock has not changed that much, but the mix, we've gone from multi-generational families to couples.

1859
02:38:41,636 --> 02:38:45,997
[SPEAKER_05]: The density has actually gone down, and that kind of retail doesn't exist anymore.

1860
02:38:46,257 --> 02:38:49,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to see us coming back to that golden age.

1861
02:38:49,178 --> 02:38:51,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't feel like we are throwing away a golden age.

1862
02:38:51,999 --> 02:38:52,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we are,

1863
02:38:53,699 --> 02:38:55,460
[SPEAKER_05]: on the cusp of being able to reclaim one.

1864
02:38:55,480 --> 02:38:58,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want to see more density in the squares.

1865
02:38:58,781 --> 02:39:00,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see more density in the neighborhoods.

1866
02:39:00,041 --> 02:39:01,762
[SPEAKER_58]: Michael, I'm going to ask you to add your comment, please.

1867
02:39:01,782 --> 02:39:02,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.

1868
02:39:03,242 --> 02:39:04,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I want my next job.

1869
02:39:04,723 --> 02:39:07,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to commute to Waltham or downtown anymore.

1870
02:39:07,884 --> 02:39:09,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my next job to be in Medford.

1871
02:39:09,445 --> 02:39:13,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to have co-workers who live in Medford, who patronize Medford restaurants for lunch.

1872
02:39:14,406 --> 02:39:20,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that is only going to be possible if we have increased business density in the squares and increased residential density in the neighborhoods.

1873
02:39:20,949 --> 02:39:21,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1874
02:39:23,380 --> 02:39:23,921
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Michael.

1875
02:39:25,963 --> 02:39:30,729
[SPEAKER_58]: Our next commenter is through Zoom, and they are Ren Bean.

1876
02:39:33,993 --> 02:39:35,415
[SPEAKER_58]: Ren, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

1877
02:39:37,055 --> 02:39:38,335
[SPEAKER_78]: Yes, hello, thank you.

1878
02:39:39,496 --> 02:39:48,058
[SPEAKER_78]: I want to express support for the residential zoning proposal in its current form.

1879
02:39:49,899 --> 02:39:56,761
[SPEAKER_78]: I see it as the result of a year plus, multi-years if you would include the comprehensive plan.

1880
02:39:56,781 --> 02:40:01,502
[SPEAKER_78]: A few people have scoffed at that, but there was a lot of public input to that and it's a pretty thoughtful document.

1881
02:40:03,462 --> 02:40:05,463
[SPEAKER_78]: and the housing production plan.

1882
02:40:05,483 --> 02:40:13,904
[SPEAKER_78]: I think this proposal, you know, brings to life in detail a lot of the goals in those plans.

1883
02:40:14,765 --> 02:40:21,086
[SPEAKER_78]: You know, people can sort of have disagreements about the best way to accomplish some of the goals, but I think the proposal is quite good.

1884
02:40:22,466 --> 02:40:26,227
[SPEAKER_78]: I do agree with an earlier commenter that we're, you know, we're faced with some trade-offs, right?

1885
02:40:26,527 --> 02:40:31,568
[SPEAKER_78]: I just think it's worth noting and recognizing that inaction also poses trade-offs.

1886
02:40:32,128 --> 02:40:36,551
[SPEAKER_78]: You know, we recently faced the question of whether or not we needed an override.

1887
02:40:36,971 --> 02:40:41,054
[SPEAKER_78]: We needed to decide if we were going to lay off, you know, 40 plus educators.

1888
02:40:42,034 --> 02:40:47,557
[SPEAKER_78]: We didn't, the community didn't agree to invest in a new, you know, fire facility.

1889
02:40:48,398 --> 02:40:55,042
[SPEAKER_78]: You know, we hired three people to fix roads, but we still face a multi-million dollar, multi-year backlog of road repairs.

1890
02:40:55,522 --> 02:41:06,507
[SPEAKER_78]: And I think it's important to recognize that adding residential and commercial space in the city will increase our tax base and allow us to do a lot of the things the city needs to do, fund the services the city needs to have.

1891
02:41:06,887 --> 02:41:20,072
[SPEAKER_78]: And I think we need to grapple with the reality that if we don't increase our revenues, the limitations of Prop 2.5 mean that we can only increase our levy by 2.5% every year, which does not even cover the cost of inflation.

1892
02:41:20,132 --> 02:41:21,793
[SPEAKER_78]: Our city budget is going to continue to shrink

1893
02:41:22,313 --> 02:41:30,256
[SPEAKER_78]: year after year, and in terms of Medford becoming a desirable place to live, we will slowly become a less desirable place to live.

1894
02:41:30,696 --> 02:41:33,397
[SPEAKER_78]: I count myself lucky to be a homeowner here, single-family home.

1895
02:41:34,458 --> 02:41:47,703
[SPEAKER_78]: I don't share the view of a lot of single-family homeowners who have spoken saying that they feel like the presence of multi-family units impact negatively their ability to enjoy their single-family home.

1896
02:41:48,285 --> 02:41:58,171
[SPEAKER_78]: I live in an area that's being upzoned in this proposal to neighborhood residential 3, which could be 2 to 4 units of historical conversion, triple deckers.

1897
02:41:58,211 --> 02:42:00,072
[SPEAKER_78]: I live near triple deckers and double deckers.

1898
02:42:00,692 --> 02:42:05,715
[SPEAKER_78]: Some good friends and neighbors live in multi-unit buildings, and they're great people.

1899
02:42:05,755 --> 02:42:08,256
[SPEAKER_78]: Having another one or two of them on my street wouldn't be such a bad thing.

1900
02:42:10,239 --> 02:42:13,500
[SPEAKER_78]: I get there's never a change.

1901
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:14,700
[SPEAKER_78]: People like their neighborhood.

1902
02:42:14,740 --> 02:42:15,620
[SPEAKER_78]: They like their neighbors.

1903
02:42:15,700 --> 02:42:21,021
[SPEAKER_78]: But I think it's also important to acknowledge that when people sell, they downsize, they move.

1904
02:42:21,641 --> 02:42:25,542
[SPEAKER_78]: The people that move into those buildings are going to be facing very high costs.

1905
02:42:25,722 --> 02:42:31,843
[SPEAKER_78]: And the fabric of this community will just simply not be composed of what it was 30, 40 years ago when housing cost $40,000, which inflation adjusted money is like,

1906
02:42:36,386 --> 02:42:40,670
[SPEAKER_78]: You know, housing costs have just gone way high, and this is a regional problem.

1907
02:42:40,770 --> 02:42:42,752
[SPEAKER_78]: We know that, but it's impacting our city.

1908
02:42:43,012 --> 02:42:43,793
[SPEAKER_78]: The world is changing.

1909
02:42:43,853 --> 02:42:44,653
[SPEAKER_78]: The region is changing.

1910
02:42:44,673 --> 02:42:46,375
[SPEAKER_78]: The question is, how is our city going to change with it?

1911
02:42:46,775 --> 02:42:51,139
[SPEAKER_78]: I think we should, you know, invite more neighbors to fund the city the way it deserves to be funded.

1912
02:42:51,459 --> 02:42:51,880
[SPEAKER_78]: Thank you very much.

1913
02:42:57,493 --> 02:42:57,974
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Ren.

1914
02:42:57,994 --> 02:43:00,780
[SPEAKER_58]: I see we have an in-person commenter.

1915
02:43:01,362 --> 02:43:03,306
[SPEAKER_58]: Have you spoken on neighborhood and residential before?

1916
02:43:03,466 --> 02:43:04,308
[SPEAKER_58]: Awesome, come on up.

1917
02:43:04,829 --> 02:43:06,413
[SPEAKER_58]: Please say your name and address for the record.

1918
02:43:08,171 --> 02:43:08,871
[SPEAKER_58]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1919
02:43:10,292 --> 02:43:10,752
[SPEAKER_58]: Now you're good.

1920
02:43:11,112 --> 02:43:11,672
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you so much.

1921
02:43:12,172 --> 02:43:13,452
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi, I'm Melanie Tringali.

1922
02:43:13,712 --> 02:43:23,875
[SPEAKER_29]: I live at 1164 Street, and I just wanted to thank the mayor for calling in today and requesting to slow down and stop the residential zoning.

1923
02:43:25,215 --> 02:43:29,596
[SPEAKER_29]: Many people have already spoken, so I'm not going to repeat everything they said, because I've agreed with a lot of them.

1924
02:43:30,797 --> 02:43:35,398
[SPEAKER_29]: Increased density does not necessarily mean that we're going to bring down our housing cost.

1925
02:43:36,338 --> 02:43:36,958
[SPEAKER_29]: that we need to slow down.

1926
02:43:36,978 --> 02:43:37,939
[SPEAKER_29]: Um increase in traffic.

1927
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:40,561
[SPEAKER_29]: Uh our infrastructure.

1928
02:43:40,821 --> 02:43:41,742
[SPEAKER_29]: Our schools are safety.

1929
02:43:41,802 --> 02:43:43,883
[SPEAKER_29]: All that I think will be extremely impacted.

1930
02:43:44,423 --> 02:43:46,245
[SPEAKER_29]: And I know that you wanted to focus on.

1931
02:43:47,265 --> 02:43:52,088
[SPEAKER_29]: Residential zoning, but I also think that we need to slow down on the square zoning.

1932
02:43:52,989 --> 02:43:54,430
[SPEAKER_29]: Um we need to get it right.

1933
02:43:54,590 --> 02:43:54,670
[SPEAKER_29]: The

1934
02:44:02,415 --> 02:44:04,336
[SPEAKER_29]: We need to increase our commercial base.

1935
02:44:04,957 --> 02:44:08,419
[SPEAKER_29]: We're not going to increase our revenue by increasing density in residence.

1936
02:44:08,679 --> 02:44:10,320
[SPEAKER_29]: We need to increase our commercial base.

1937
02:44:10,661 --> 02:44:13,763
[SPEAKER_29]: We need to have vibrant squares, and you need to have a plan for that.

1938
02:44:14,383 --> 02:44:17,906
[SPEAKER_29]: Just rezoning and saying, come to us is not going to work.

1939
02:44:18,306 --> 02:44:19,066
[SPEAKER_29]: There needs to be a plan.

1940
02:44:20,247 --> 02:44:35,214
[SPEAKER_29]: In addition to stopping and opposing the residential, I strongly recommend that we slow down on our squares and get it right so that we have the commercial base that we need to have vibrant squares and the tax revenue that we need.

1941
02:44:35,634 --> 02:44:35,974
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1942
02:44:37,515 --> 02:44:38,116
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Melanie.

1943
02:44:39,876 --> 02:44:46,219
[SPEAKER_58]: And before I go back to Zoom, are there any other in-person commenters that have not signed up, that have not spoken before?

1944
02:44:48,521 --> 02:44:49,732
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, come on up, sir.

1945
02:44:49,914 --> 02:44:50,520
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you so much.

1946
02:44:51,214 --> 02:44:53,335
[SPEAKER_45]: William Snyder at 87 Ward Street.

1947
02:44:53,535 --> 02:44:54,276
[SPEAKER_45]: Hi, William.

1948
02:44:54,296 --> 02:45:03,561
[SPEAKER_45]: I won't take too much of your time, but I just wanted to suggest that one place to look here is what happened in Cambridge.

1949
02:45:04,361 --> 02:45:19,710
[SPEAKER_45]: Cambridge, after Peter Sigourney left 10 years ago, Cambridge flipped from maybe a balance of owner-occupied properties to a two-to-one ratio now, where it's really a land, it's a developer, landlord, renter community,

1950
02:45:20,350 --> 02:45:36,615
[SPEAKER_45]: and that that constituency led the Cambridge City Council to pass one of the most radical rezoning plans in the country, where they're allowing four to six story buildings five feet from the property line on any residential zone.

1951
02:45:38,855 --> 02:45:48,698
[SPEAKER_45]: And one of the things, one of the consequences is that even before that passed, developers snapped up 250 properties to build and

1952
02:45:49,198 --> 02:45:55,865
[SPEAKER_45]: There's an example of a cape that was raised to put up a $2.5 million glass modern house.

1953
02:45:56,585 --> 02:45:59,068
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't think that's the goal here.

1954
02:46:00,649 --> 02:46:06,315
[SPEAKER_45]: And so I think one possible way forward is to

1955
02:46:07,496 --> 02:46:11,539
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, uh, take a pause and see what see how Cambridge turns out.

1956
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,282
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't think we want to be the People's Republic of Cambridge.

1957
02:46:15,002 --> 02:46:19,025
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, and right now, Medford has, I think it was stated.

1958
02:46:19,045 --> 02:46:22,868
[SPEAKER_45]: I think Medford has a slight majority of owner occupied properties.

1959
02:46:23,629 --> 02:46:27,852
[SPEAKER_45]: Um, uh, and just another number is that, um,

1960
02:46:28,973 --> 02:46:34,456
[SPEAKER_45]: You know, we're basically experimenting with about $8,000 million worth of owner-occupied properties in Medford.

1961
02:46:35,116 --> 02:46:38,038
[SPEAKER_45]: And so I think we should be very careful about how we move forward.

1962
02:46:38,078 --> 02:46:38,398
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

1963
02:46:39,539 --> 02:46:45,482
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, William.

1964
02:46:47,563 --> 02:46:51,285
[SPEAKER_58]: Have you spoken about the neighborhood urban residential zoning before?

1965
02:46:51,305 --> 02:46:52,145
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, thank you very much.

1966
02:46:52,425 --> 02:46:53,486
[SPEAKER_28]: What is your name, miss?

1967
02:46:54,838 --> 02:46:57,919
[SPEAKER_58]: Have you spoken about the neighborhood and urban residential zoning before?

1968
02:46:58,620 --> 02:47:01,601
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm just, I'm on the list right there.

1969
02:47:02,081 --> 02:47:02,561
[SPEAKER_28]: What's your name?

1970
02:47:04,962 --> 02:47:05,742
[SPEAKER_58]: My name is Emily.

1971
02:47:06,102 --> 02:47:09,483
[SPEAKER_28]: Emily, you're doing a fine job as MC for months.

1972
02:47:10,103 --> 02:47:10,524
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

1973
02:47:10,544 --> 02:47:12,184
[SPEAKER_58]: It means a lot to have you guys here.

1974
02:47:12,204 --> 02:47:14,505
[SPEAKER_58]: It means a lot to have you all here.

1975
02:47:14,865 --> 02:47:15,985
[SPEAKER_58]: So thank you for showing up.

1976
02:47:16,146 --> 02:47:17,666
[SPEAKER_28]: And I like the way you control the mic.

1977
02:47:19,627 --> 02:47:20,227
[SPEAKER_28]: So anyways,

1978
02:47:21,165 --> 02:47:25,447
[SPEAKER_28]: B, I'm glad Mayor Breonna- I'm sorry, can you state your name and address for the record?

1979
02:47:25,648 --> 02:47:28,849
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure, Andrew Castagnetti, East Medford, Massachusetts.

1980
02:47:28,869 --> 02:47:29,530
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Andrew.

1981
02:47:29,610 --> 02:47:35,093
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm glad the Mayor Breonna came to her senses before the election.

1982
02:47:38,295 --> 02:47:40,696
[SPEAKER_28]: I get it, the city wants maximum monies.

1983
02:47:42,137 --> 02:47:44,338
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't mind development if it's smart development.

1984
02:47:48,260 --> 02:47:50,662
[SPEAKER_28]: The best and only place for development

1985
02:47:51,496 --> 02:47:53,337
[SPEAKER_28]: in my opinion, is Mystic Avenue.

1986
02:47:53,897 --> 02:48:00,161
[SPEAKER_28]: Since 1960 when they built Route 93, because that was the old highway to Boston, Route 38.

1987
02:48:03,843 --> 02:48:07,626
[SPEAKER_28]: And the city has the power, don't forget, of eminent domain, mind you.

1988
02:48:10,407 --> 02:48:19,673
[SPEAKER_28]: Versus developing Salem Street, which is already congested, it will become like Somerville with big time Somerville hassles.

1989
02:48:20,984 --> 02:48:29,147
[SPEAKER_28]: By the way, the prop two and a half override cost me $1,000 per year forever and ever and ever.

1990
02:48:33,229 --> 02:48:37,611
[SPEAKER_28]: Will this new zoning idea lower our present real estate tax at all?

1991
02:48:37,631 --> 02:48:39,692
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think so.

1992
02:48:40,692 --> 02:48:42,633
[SPEAKER_28]: Unless you tax all new housing,

1993
02:48:43,276 --> 02:48:50,158
[SPEAKER_28]: from this point on at a third tax rate of, let's say, in the middle, $15 per thousand.

1994
02:48:50,638 --> 02:48:51,738
[SPEAKER_28]: You got a shot that way.

1995
02:48:53,158 --> 02:48:53,518
[SPEAKER_28]: Five.

1996
02:48:53,539 --> 02:48:55,239
[SPEAKER_58]: 30 seconds.

1997
02:48:56,259 --> 02:48:57,259
[SPEAKER_28]: 30 seconds is plenty.

1998
02:48:57,319 --> 02:48:57,920
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, dear.

1999
02:48:59,020 --> 02:49:06,602
[SPEAKER_28]: What the heck happened to those three Chapter 40B real estate projects from three years ago, four years ago?

2000
02:49:07,282 --> 02:49:08,742
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you know anything about that at all?

2001
02:49:09,943 --> 02:49:10,963
[SPEAKER_41]: I'll talk about it later.

2002
02:49:11,563 --> 02:49:11,823
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry?

2003
02:49:13,404 --> 02:49:20,610
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it seems like all three were sued by the city and they can't do it because it's not cost effective.

2004
02:49:20,810 --> 02:49:21,511
[SPEAKER_28]: They're bankrupt.

2005
02:49:21,891 --> 02:49:25,894
[SPEAKER_28]: We lost out on hundreds of apartments, millions of dollars.

2006
02:49:27,936 --> 02:49:31,359
[SPEAKER_28]: Lastly, thank you.

2007
02:49:31,919 --> 02:49:38,205
[SPEAKER_28]: If you are still listening, I'm just trying to make some sense to save our Republic of the USA.

2008
02:49:41,278 --> 02:49:41,878
[SPEAKER_28]: America.

2009
02:49:43,039 --> 02:49:44,020
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for listening.

2010
02:49:44,900 --> 02:49:45,521
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Andrew.

2011
02:49:48,362 --> 02:49:58,869
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go back to a zoom commenter who has not commented to date on neighborhood residential, urban residential, uh, Paulette Barbadian.

2012
02:49:58,889 --> 02:50:05,993
[SPEAKER_59]: Are you unmuting?

2013
02:50:06,533 --> 02:50:08,074
[SPEAKER_59]: I was, but it keeps clicking on and off.

2014
02:50:13,450 --> 02:50:14,671
[SPEAKER_59]: I don't know.

2015
02:50:14,711 --> 02:50:32,139
[SPEAKER_59]: This is the same problem that I was having with iPhone too.

2016
02:50:33,379 --> 02:50:35,860
[SPEAKER_58]: Collette, I'm having technical difficulties unmuting you.

2017
02:50:35,880 --> 02:50:39,282
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm gonna try again.

2018
02:50:42,180 --> 02:50:43,342
[SPEAKER_58]: It just mutes right away.

2019
02:50:43,362 --> 02:50:46,128
[SPEAKER_58]: That's really weird.

2020
02:50:46,508 --> 02:50:47,871
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm going to go back to in-person.

2021
02:50:54,300 --> 02:50:54,520
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah.

2022
02:50:55,161 --> 02:50:55,361
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay.

2023
02:50:55,381 --> 02:51:02,366
[SPEAKER_58]: So now we're going to go to, um, are there any in-person, in-person people that have not talked before?

2024
02:51:02,606 --> 02:51:02,907
[SPEAKER_58]: He is.

2025
02:51:03,087 --> 02:51:03,807
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay.

2026
02:51:04,067 --> 02:51:04,568
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay.

2027
02:51:04,788 --> 02:51:13,875
[SPEAKER_58]: So we're going to go in order of sign up and I'm just going to read through all the names just to give people a little better understanding of where they are when they are.

2028
02:51:15,824 --> 02:51:35,117
[SPEAKER_58]: So we have Page Buldini, Nick Oleg, William Navarre, Paul Garrity, Chris Dedeck, Erika DeRoche, Zachary Shertock, Shannon DeYesso, Kaitlyn Robsion, Alexander Panchik, Andrew Castagnetti, Michael Corbett, and Cheryl Rodriguez.

2029
02:51:35,657 --> 02:51:37,979
[SPEAKER_58]: That includes in-person and Zoom people.

2030
02:51:38,619 --> 02:51:41,281
[SPEAKER_58]: So that's the people that we have on the list right now that have signed up.

2031
02:51:42,522 --> 02:51:43,022
[SPEAKER_58]: So Paige.

2032
02:51:44,733 --> 02:51:45,934
[SPEAKER_58]: You're our next in-person speaker.

2033
02:51:49,777 --> 02:51:54,440
[SPEAKER_37]: Page Buldini, 37 Winter Street, and I own a skincare salon at 319 Boston Ave.

2034
02:51:54,460 --> 02:51:56,782
[SPEAKER_37]: Sorry about my back to everybody.

2035
02:51:57,803 --> 02:51:59,784
[SPEAKER_37]: I want to start by thanking you guys.

2036
02:52:00,084 --> 02:52:01,826
[SPEAKER_37]: I know that we don't have to do that, but thank you so much.

2037
02:52:01,986 --> 02:52:06,189
[SPEAKER_37]: I know how many messages I've sent personally, so I can only imagine what you've been receiving overall.

2038
02:52:06,209 --> 02:52:09,772
[SPEAKER_37]: I appreciate the time and effort you're putting into reading, considering it all.

2039
02:52:10,652 --> 02:52:12,332
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a big opportunity for Medford.

2040
02:52:12,432 --> 02:52:19,094
[SPEAKER_37]: In conversations with housing experts, I've learned that this level of public engagement is rare, which is exactly why it matters.

2041
02:52:19,714 --> 02:52:27,036
[SPEAKER_37]: We have a chance to set the tone for how cities move forward with transparency, collaboration, and all departments at the table from the start.

2042
02:52:27,796 --> 02:52:30,017
[SPEAKER_37]: I also want to ask about the comprehensive plan.

2043
02:52:30,577 --> 02:52:40,239
[SPEAKER_37]: It's been referenced as a basis for this proposal, but were the departments like Medford Public Schools, police, fire, and their unions formally consulted when it was created?

2044
02:52:41,420 --> 02:52:44,842
[SPEAKER_37]: and what steps have been taken during this process to gather their input.

2045
02:52:45,342 --> 02:52:50,065
[SPEAKER_37]: That feedback, excuse me, that feedback matters, and the public deserves to hear it.

2046
02:52:50,665 --> 02:52:52,627
[SPEAKER_37]: I respectfully ask the board to pause.

2047
02:52:53,387 --> 02:53:00,491
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's be sure that the input from Everett Public Schools, police, and fire have been actively gathered and shared before any decisions are made.

2048
02:53:00,511 --> 02:53:01,432
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2049
02:53:01,452 --> 02:53:05,634
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Paige.

2050
02:53:06,355 --> 02:53:07,456
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Nick Uleg.

2051
02:53:09,437 --> 02:53:09,717
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi, Nick.

2052
02:53:11,960 --> 02:53:12,440
[SPEAKER_47]: Hi, everybody.

2053
02:53:12,740 --> 02:53:13,000
[SPEAKER_47]: Thanks.

2054
02:53:14,021 --> 02:53:14,721
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll keep it brief.

2055
02:53:14,801 --> 02:53:16,522
[SPEAKER_47]: I had two things to talk about, but it's getting late.

2056
02:53:17,002 --> 02:53:20,683
[SPEAKER_47]: I just want to talk about the issue of schools that's come up a few times tonight.

2057
02:53:21,764 --> 02:53:27,226
[SPEAKER_47]: So some have claimed that the schools cannot handle more students and the zoning will exacerbate overcrowding that's experienced at them.

2058
02:53:27,706 --> 02:53:30,747
[SPEAKER_47]: I have two kids in Medford Public Schools, so this concerns me as well.

2059
02:53:31,845 --> 02:53:34,828
[SPEAKER_47]: The current situation in Medford schools was not caused by zoning.

2060
02:53:35,248 --> 02:53:44,016
[SPEAKER_47]: It was caused by keeping our taxes artificially low, selling off city-owned property in no small part by the actions of councils decades ago.

2061
02:53:44,517 --> 02:53:49,722
[SPEAKER_47]: I want to push back strongly on the idea that we need now to make a new mistake in order to atone for those old mistakes.

2062
02:53:50,725 --> 02:54:04,737
[SPEAKER_47]: Data shows that other municipalities in the area, 12 municipalities over the period from 2010 to 2020 showed no statistically significant difference in their increase in school enrollment despite wide variations in the amount of housing that they added over that period.

2063
02:54:05,177 --> 02:54:13,304
[SPEAKER_47]: Anywhere from zero to 15% increases in housing stock had no appreciable difference in the change in enrollment for those school boards.

2064
02:54:14,715 --> 02:54:17,737
[SPEAKER_47]: Um, do we need to deal with the future growth of Medford student enrollment?

2065
02:54:18,138 --> 02:54:18,658
[SPEAKER_47]: Absolutely.

2066
02:54:18,738 --> 02:54:22,541
[SPEAKER_47]: There are already problems as people have highlighted, and I have a vested interest in this.

2067
02:54:22,801 --> 02:54:26,063
[SPEAKER_47]: But as the saying goes, we are able to walk and chew gum at the same time.

2068
02:54:26,504 --> 02:54:33,269
[SPEAKER_47]: Delaying this already delayed zoning effort will not help the situation of the schools, and it will hurt the rest of the city in other ways.

2069
02:54:34,049 --> 02:54:34,910
[SPEAKER_47]: I'll end my comment there.

2070
02:54:35,030 --> 02:54:35,951
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you very much for your time.

2071
02:54:37,272 --> 02:54:37,752
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Nick.

2072
02:54:40,914 --> 02:54:43,236
[SPEAKER_58]: We're gonna pop back to a couple of our

2073
02:54:43,795 --> 02:54:48,016
[SPEAKER_58]: speakers that may have figured out the technical side of things.

2074
02:54:48,476 --> 02:54:50,716
[SPEAKER_58]: So iPhone, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

2075
02:54:52,337 --> 02:54:53,037
[SPEAKER_58]: Looks like it worked.

2076
02:54:53,357 --> 02:54:53,777
[SPEAKER_54]: Are you there?

2077
02:54:54,477 --> 02:54:54,797
[SPEAKER_54]: Hello?

2078
02:54:54,857 --> 02:54:55,077
[SPEAKER_54]: Yes.

2079
02:54:55,137 --> 02:54:55,837
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you so much.

2080
02:54:55,917 --> 02:54:56,778
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm sorry about that.

2081
02:54:57,178 --> 02:54:57,638
[SPEAKER_54]: Can you hear me?

2082
02:54:57,658 --> 02:54:57,938
[SPEAKER_54]: Okay.

2083
02:54:58,638 --> 02:54:58,818
[SPEAKER_58]: Yep.

2084
02:54:58,898 --> 02:55:00,358
[SPEAKER_58]: Please state your name and address for the record.

2085
02:55:00,838 --> 02:55:01,078
[SPEAKER_54]: Yes.

2086
02:55:01,259 --> 02:55:07,340
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm Amanda O'Leary and I live on Cumming Street, but I have lived in Medford for 32 years.

2087
02:55:09,309 --> 02:55:11,751
[SPEAKER_54]: Um, I am a third generation.

2088
02:55:11,851 --> 02:55:13,812
[SPEAKER_54]: My son's actually fourth generation.

2089
02:55:13,832 --> 02:55:27,942
[SPEAKER_54]: Um, what the government would consider a higher income millennial, something that I think Medford is trying to attract given these changes, but I'm completely opposed to the zoning change.

2090
02:55:29,063 --> 02:55:35,548
[SPEAKER_54]: I did a right to the city council, the mayor, also the planning director.

2091
02:55:36,573 --> 02:55:44,457
[SPEAKER_54]: Um, I did hear from the planning director mayor, but understand that this is really the, uh, community board.

2092
02:55:44,617 --> 02:55:47,178
[SPEAKER_54]: Also city council approved it.

2093
02:55:47,978 --> 02:55:57,062
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm a little upset that from the city council perspective, I only heard from two people, neither of which were the president or vice president.

2094
02:55:57,602 --> 02:56:03,125
[SPEAKER_54]: I think if they can't respond easily, and this was a few months ago.

2095
02:56:03,585 --> 02:56:05,386
[SPEAKER_54]: So if they can't easily.

2096
02:56:06,601 --> 02:56:15,259
[SPEAKER_54]: respond even an acknowledgement to the current population, how are they going to increase responses from increasing density?

2097
02:56:17,415 --> 02:56:20,736
[SPEAKER_54]: But, you know, Medford growing up was a beautiful city.

2098
02:56:20,756 --> 02:56:22,377
[SPEAKER_54]: It's disgusting now.

2099
02:56:22,717 --> 02:56:24,058
[SPEAKER_54]: Just walk the streets.

2100
02:56:24,618 --> 02:56:26,959
[SPEAKER_54]: Medford is completely disgusting.

2101
02:56:27,919 --> 02:56:29,220
[SPEAKER_54]: Again, I'm a millennial.

2102
02:56:29,480 --> 02:56:29,940
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm not.

2103
02:56:29,960 --> 02:56:35,742
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm not somebody who has some agenda or whatever.

2104
02:56:35,762 --> 02:56:40,944
[SPEAKER_54]: I just want to bring my son up to somewhere that he can grow.

2105
02:56:41,725 --> 02:56:42,765
[SPEAKER_54]: And thank you.

2106
02:56:43,842 --> 02:56:47,304
[SPEAKER_54]: You can enjoy living and I can't wait to move out of Medford.

2107
02:56:47,724 --> 02:56:53,746
[SPEAKER_54]: It's this Medford, the density, look on Airbnb, look at the rental units.

2108
02:56:54,227 --> 02:56:58,829
[SPEAKER_54]: They say that parking will be addressed by the units.

2109
02:56:59,349 --> 02:57:10,474
[SPEAKER_54]: But when you have a three bedroom and it's three bedrooms rented out by tough students or Airbnb and six cars per unit, that's not gonna fix the rental units.

2110
02:57:12,388 --> 02:57:13,089
[SPEAKER_54]: It's just sad.

2111
02:57:13,829 --> 02:57:17,132
[SPEAKER_54]: Medford is becoming sad, and I'm sad for it.

2112
02:57:17,372 --> 02:57:19,093
[SPEAKER_54]: Again, 32 years.

2113
02:57:19,834 --> 02:57:24,177
[SPEAKER_54]: Again, residents shouldn't be sad to move out of Medford.

2114
02:57:27,079 --> 02:57:27,460
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

2115
02:57:29,761 --> 02:57:30,622
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you for your comment.

2116
02:57:30,722 --> 02:57:31,282
[SPEAKER_58]: I appreciate it.

2117
02:57:32,443 --> 02:57:33,324
[SPEAKER_41]: We didn't get your name.

2118
02:57:33,364 --> 02:57:34,425
[SPEAKER_41]: Could you message it to me?

2119
02:57:35,485 --> 02:57:35,666
[SPEAKER_54]: Yep.

2120
02:57:36,106 --> 02:57:36,746
[SPEAKER_54]: Amanda O'Leary.

2121
02:57:37,067 --> 02:57:37,387
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

2122
02:57:39,689 --> 02:57:40,149
[SPEAKER_54]: Thanks, Amanda.

2123
02:57:44,588 --> 02:57:45,889
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm gonna try with Paulette again.

2124
02:57:46,449 --> 02:57:48,750
[SPEAKER_58]: Paulette, I'm gonna go ahead and try to unmute you as well.

2125
02:57:48,770 --> 02:57:53,013
[SPEAKER_58]: All right, he's doing the same thing.

2126
02:57:53,233 --> 02:57:57,055
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm gonna keep going with the next people.

2127
02:57:57,375 --> 02:57:59,616
[SPEAKER_58]: I see William Navar has switched to Zoom.

2128
02:57:59,997 --> 02:58:01,677
[SPEAKER_58]: William, I'm gonna go ahead and unmute you.

2129
02:58:01,698 --> 02:58:05,940
[SPEAKER_58]: Hello, can you hear me?

2130
02:58:07,228 --> 02:58:08,149
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes, thank you, William.

2131
02:58:08,189 --> 02:58:08,770
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, William.

2132
02:58:09,752 --> 02:58:10,052
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

2133
02:58:10,072 --> 02:58:21,469
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to say, and I'll keep it brief because I've spoken before, 108 Medford Street, adding more people in an urban neighborhood like mine tends to make it better, I think.

2134
02:58:22,270 --> 02:58:24,371
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, my neighborhood deserves a grocery store.

2135
02:58:24,391 --> 02:58:26,271
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been saying that since we come here.

2136
02:58:26,812 --> 02:58:30,693
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that having more neighbors is the way to make that happen.

2137
02:58:31,093 --> 02:58:36,415
[SPEAKER_17]: I think when we have more neighbors in an urban neighborhood, that's what makes the transit possible to make better.

2138
02:58:36,455 --> 02:58:39,896
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't make it better more frequent if there's not enough people to ride it.

2139
02:58:40,316 --> 02:58:44,338
[SPEAKER_17]: More people in an urban neighborhood can make it better.

2140
02:58:44,918 --> 02:58:47,859
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that we need to be ready for,

2141
02:58:49,317 --> 02:58:54,839
[SPEAKER_17]: to unapologetically and enthusiastically embrace that miracle that is cities.

2142
02:58:54,919 --> 02:58:55,579
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, bye-bye.

2143
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:58,580
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, William.

2144
02:59:01,041 --> 02:59:05,703
[SPEAKER_58]: The next speaker we have is Paul Garrity.

2145
02:59:05,723 --> 02:59:10,725
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't see them.

2146
02:59:11,485 --> 02:59:11,785
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay.

2147
02:59:13,946 --> 02:59:17,948
[SPEAKER_58]: We are highlighting people that are not able to speak just so we have it for record as well.

2148
02:59:19,177 --> 02:59:20,258
[SPEAKER_58]: Um, Chris.

2149
02:59:20,278 --> 02:59:24,562
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, how's it going?

2150
02:59:24,582 --> 02:59:28,185
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, Chris, thanks.

2151
02:59:28,586 --> 02:59:35,892
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, yeah, so I wanted to actually talk about the actual proposal, um, for mostly for and R3 and you are 1, um.

2152
02:59:36,713 --> 02:59:44,920
[SPEAKER_26]: From the February pull up until the May 25th or May 27th, whatever that meeting was, um, the.

2153
02:59:46,001 --> 02:59:54,407
[SPEAKER_26]: Building coverage was set for like 50 and 60% and then at the June 18th meeting, it was kind of just snuck in there down to 40%.

2154
02:59:54,728 --> 02:59:59,431
[SPEAKER_26]: And if you look at the map for the 3500 square foot to 5000 square foot lots.

2155
03:00:02,878 --> 03:00:13,082
[SPEAKER_26]: That accumulates for most of the lots of the NR3 and UR1s and they're all currently in the 30 to 40% building coverage range.

2156
03:00:13,402 --> 03:00:20,545
[SPEAKER_26]: So that'd be virtually no change at all, which if we're rezoning, no change doesn't really make sense.

2157
03:00:21,505 --> 03:00:31,549
[SPEAKER_26]: And then another thing I wanted to talk about was, I don't think a lot of people here, they're kind of just like scared of every developer is gonna buy whatever.

2158
03:00:32,229 --> 03:00:36,392
[SPEAKER_26]: But I don't think a lot of people understand the lot dimensions and setbacks.

2159
03:00:37,953 --> 03:00:45,959
[SPEAKER_26]: On a 3,500 to 5,000 square foot lot, there's a pretty slim chance that you're going to be able to meet every requirement to put six units.

2160
03:00:46,640 --> 03:00:58,168
[SPEAKER_26]: So you're most likely not going to see a three-story, six-unit building next door to you, unless the unique situation of a double lot or an extremely large lot, which, again, they're rare in Medford.

2161
03:01:00,388 --> 03:01:09,453
[SPEAKER_26]: And then going back to that for the city fire department, all these buildings are going to have sprinkler systems.

2162
03:01:09,513 --> 03:01:12,414
[SPEAKER_26]: So that would put an ease on the fire department.

2163
03:01:12,714 --> 03:01:14,015
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, not the police department.

2164
03:01:14,495 --> 03:01:18,377
[SPEAKER_26]: And then I just want to go back to what the mayor was mentioning.

2165
03:01:20,045 --> 03:01:27,386
[SPEAKER_26]: If you just quick Google search, it shows the state averages 13 to one in Medford is a 10 to one student to teacher ratio.

2166
03:01:27,726 --> 03:01:36,628
[SPEAKER_26]: So busting at the seams doesn't seem like a correct term for Medford, which is 30% lower than the state in general.

2167
03:01:38,508 --> 03:01:39,308
[SPEAKER_26]: And yeah, thank you.

2168
03:01:39,328 --> 03:01:40,668
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm in support of this.

2169
03:01:40,789 --> 03:01:41,809
[SPEAKER_26]: So thank you for your time.

2170
03:01:43,649 --> 03:01:44,429
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Christopher.

2171
03:01:46,229 --> 03:01:47,750
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm gonna go back to in person.

2172
03:01:48,110 --> 03:01:49,350
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Sharon de Yeso.

2173
03:01:54,838 --> 03:01:55,799
[SPEAKER_58]: Hey, Sharon, good to see you again.

2174
03:01:56,500 --> 03:01:57,161
[SPEAKER_58]: How's your hip doing?

2175
03:02:00,845 --> 03:02:01,245
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2176
03:02:01,345 --> 03:02:01,766
[SPEAKER_35]: Looks good.

2177
03:02:03,328 --> 03:02:04,829
[SPEAKER_35]: I thought about today, too.

2178
03:02:04,930 --> 03:02:05,650
[SPEAKER_35]: Can you hear me now?

2179
03:02:06,491 --> 03:02:09,294
[SPEAKER_35]: Gee, this would be a great Verizon remake commercial, right?

2180
03:02:09,675 --> 03:02:11,437
[SPEAKER_35]: Can you hear me now?

2181
03:02:12,318 --> 03:02:15,001
[SPEAKER_35]: I live at Circuit Road, Mass Ave, the corner.

2182
03:02:16,162 --> 03:02:30,670
[SPEAKER_35]: I questioned some of the movements about private ways during the last few years and would I actually be able to take half a shower because half my property is on a private way and the other half is on an actual street.

2183
03:02:32,851 --> 03:02:36,514
[SPEAKER_35]: Anyway, I do have a few points to make.

2184
03:02:36,974 --> 03:02:42,237
[SPEAKER_35]: I know that some of this would be repetitive so I'll just take some keywords out like I do when I

2185
03:02:42,837 --> 03:02:45,418
[SPEAKER_35]: become a boring lecturer at college.

2186
03:02:46,039 --> 03:02:47,880
[SPEAKER_35]: So this is my syllabus for the evening.

2187
03:02:50,401 --> 03:02:55,844
[SPEAKER_35]: I know that everybody in the city has a different vision of our future of what they would like to see happen.

2188
03:02:55,884 --> 03:02:57,605
[SPEAKER_35]: It's like going grocery shopping.

2189
03:02:58,045 --> 03:03:01,587
[SPEAKER_35]: Believe it or not, I know some people who don't even like Italian food or pizza.

2190
03:03:02,287 --> 03:03:03,068
[SPEAKER_35]: Is it possible?

2191
03:03:03,208 --> 03:03:04,429
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes, it is.

2192
03:03:04,969 --> 03:03:09,952
[SPEAKER_35]: So you're never gonna get a whole consensus that would be agreeable.

2193
03:03:11,032 --> 03:03:22,334
[SPEAKER_35]: One thing I did notice this evening, and you probably notably did too, and thank you for your time extended, Alicia and Emily and board members, the tone is a little different tonight.

2194
03:03:23,274 --> 03:03:37,737
[SPEAKER_35]: It seems that maybe, could I use the phrase, the word's getting around, that some of these changes may actually take effect, and they were very concerned when they knew that the big slam dunk had happened on Salem Street.

2195
03:03:38,378 --> 03:03:41,324
[SPEAKER_35]: So some of us do not kind of quote buy into 30 seconds.

2196
03:03:43,737 --> 03:03:46,899
[SPEAKER_35]: that this could be a slow process, okay?

2197
03:03:47,600 --> 03:03:49,961
[SPEAKER_35]: I like, this is important, so I think I need a minute.

2198
03:03:50,422 --> 03:03:51,983
[SPEAKER_35]: Some of us wanna be educated.

2199
03:03:52,003 --> 03:03:54,244
[SPEAKER_35]: What's like the merry-go-round?

2200
03:03:54,384 --> 03:03:56,726
[SPEAKER_35]: How did this start in the beginning?

2201
03:03:56,746 --> 03:04:06,171
[SPEAKER_35]: And actually, if it does have to proceed, if something were recanted, can Salem Street then be retracted?

2202
03:04:06,191 --> 03:04:09,033
[SPEAKER_35]: They would be in glee, okay?

2203
03:04:09,754 --> 03:04:10,454
[SPEAKER_35]: And also,

2204
03:04:14,247 --> 03:04:21,137
[SPEAKER_35]: Anything that needs to proceed, we know change can happen or else we wouldn't even have an Eiffel Tower or an Empire State Building.

2205
03:04:22,018 --> 03:04:29,188
[SPEAKER_35]: The square footage minimums need to be increased if that had to be deemed that some of this would move forward.

2206
03:04:30,028 --> 03:04:31,669
[SPEAKER_35]: You need to go back to the beginning.

2207
03:04:31,789 --> 03:04:35,091
[SPEAKER_35]: The fire chief should be here, the police chief, everything.

2208
03:04:35,511 --> 03:04:37,132
[SPEAKER_35]: But we do appreciate your time.

2209
03:04:37,592 --> 03:04:39,093
[SPEAKER_35]: How did you gyrate?

2210
03:04:39,593 --> 03:04:40,533
[SPEAKER_35]: Who was involved?

2211
03:04:40,793 --> 03:04:44,795
[SPEAKER_35]: We thought it was, in other words, how did this board get created?

2212
03:04:44,835 --> 03:04:46,456
[SPEAKER_35]: What was the initial suggestion?

2213
03:04:46,856 --> 03:04:47,737
[SPEAKER_35]: Who created it?

2214
03:04:48,177 --> 03:04:53,279
[SPEAKER_35]: And doesn't it also have to go through the mayor's office too, and then back to council?

2215
03:04:53,700 --> 03:04:54,900
[SPEAKER_35]: We'd like to be educated.

2216
03:04:54,980 --> 03:04:55,461
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

2217
03:04:56,021 --> 03:04:57,101
[SPEAKER_35]: And have a cooler week.

2218
03:04:57,582 --> 03:04:58,362
[SPEAKER_35]: Have a cooler week.

2219
03:04:58,992 --> 03:04:59,632
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Sharon.

2220
03:05:01,673 --> 03:05:03,613
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go back to our Zoom commenters.

2221
03:05:03,693 --> 03:05:04,874
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Erika DeRoche.

2222
03:05:05,194 --> 03:05:06,674
[SPEAKER_58]: Erika, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

2223
03:05:06,694 --> 03:05:14,837
[SPEAKER_58]: All right.

2224
03:05:15,237 --> 03:05:16,357
[SPEAKER_51]: I think you're unmuted.

2225
03:05:16,377 --> 03:05:17,357
[SPEAKER_51]: Oh, now I am.

2226
03:05:17,718 --> 03:05:18,218
[SPEAKER_51]: Can you hear me?

2227
03:05:18,278 --> 03:05:18,718
[SPEAKER_51]: There you go.

2228
03:05:19,098 --> 03:05:19,478
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you.

2229
03:05:20,298 --> 03:05:20,578
[SPEAKER_51]: OK.

2230
03:05:20,678 --> 03:05:21,379
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you very much.

2231
03:05:21,459 --> 03:05:23,479
[SPEAKER_51]: Erika DeRoche, 260 Willis Ave.

2232
03:05:26,433 --> 03:05:43,004
[SPEAKER_51]: Community opposition I've heard to the neighborhood residential and urban residential zoning proposals centers on some concerns about transportation, green space, tree removal, lack of open space.

2233
03:05:43,865 --> 03:05:49,949
[SPEAKER_51]: I want to respond to those concerns by making an environmental argument in favor of the proposed zoning.

2234
03:05:50,783 --> 03:05:59,953
[SPEAKER_51]: Um, if Medford zoning wants to reflect the stated city goals of sustainability and resilience, um, the possibility of increasing density.

2235
03:05:59,973 --> 03:06:03,096
[SPEAKER_51]: Um, and you know, it's not a dirty word to me.

2236
03:06:03,236 --> 03:06:12,626
[SPEAKER_51]: It's actually a positive, um, that permits increased investment in the local economy, local environment and community cohesion.

2237
03:06:13,495 --> 03:06:20,156
[SPEAKER_51]: This is known as the triple bottom line approach because it has a three tiered foundation focusing on people, planet and profit.

2238
03:06:20,176 --> 03:06:31,619
[SPEAKER_51]: The proposed zoning provides the potential for increased density, allowing people trying to live in Medford the option to reduce their footprint by choosing smaller homes.

2239
03:06:32,219 --> 03:06:37,860
[SPEAKER_51]: The first step in any sustainability action plan or environmental approach is to reduce

2240
03:06:38,545 --> 03:06:42,368
[SPEAKER_51]: or right-size the solution to meet the needs being addressed.

2241
03:06:43,089 --> 03:06:49,614
[SPEAKER_51]: So give people the opportunity to literally reduce their home and lifestyle footprint, and they will make it.

2242
03:06:50,635 --> 03:06:54,038
[SPEAKER_51]: And that's what I had to say in a nutshell.

2243
03:06:54,078 --> 03:06:54,879
[SPEAKER_51]: Thank you very much.

2244
03:06:56,880 --> 03:06:57,521
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Erica.

2245
03:06:59,162 --> 03:07:01,084
[SPEAKER_58]: Our next speaker is Zachary Chertok.

2246
03:07:01,644 --> 03:07:03,386
[SPEAKER_58]: Zachary, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

2247
03:07:07,470 --> 03:07:09,471
[SPEAKER_58]: All right, you can hear me now.

2248
03:07:10,051 --> 03:07:10,751
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes, thank you.

2249
03:07:11,532 --> 03:07:13,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Zachary chart talk 5 on my street.

2250
03:07:13,452 --> 03:07:27,758
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the neighborhood residential zoning is the largest and most cumulative proposal within this process with that in mind accounting for the testimonial from the head of the D. P. W. Tonight interview of memorandums that I filed with this board, the city council on the mayor and in view of the test, the mayor's testimony tonight.

2251
03:07:28,958 --> 03:07:39,187
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fairly obvious that the sectional master planning that's necessary to take a measured approach to implementing the aspirations of the comprehensive plan, including for such things and zoning have really not adequately been done.

2252
03:07:40,088 --> 03:07:52,258
[SPEAKER_00]: It's vitally important for a city whose budget is thin and whose marginal capacity for financial improvement is limited to take a measured approach to zoning based on a measured and sectional master plan that reflects, but is not supplemented by aspirations on the comprehensive plan.

2253
03:07:53,019 --> 03:08:04,741
[SPEAKER_00]: The head of DPW is admitted to having the tools to model many of the infrastructure requirements relative to current capital outlays, making it possible to bring the measures to bear to determine the feasibility for some of these proposed zoning maximums.

2254
03:08:05,442 --> 03:08:20,465
[SPEAKER_00]: With all that noted, it continues to challenge density flow trajectories and common practice for managing those, that the highest density additions in the residential zones continue to be pulled furthest from multimodal transit access points, where section demand increases first, hence the motivation for 3A.

2255
03:08:21,865 --> 03:08:33,615
[SPEAKER_00]: When any of us mentioned Glenwood, it may seem repetitive, but it's because this issue continues to go unanswered either in practice from the consultants or from engineering around the capacity for this or why outside of land cost bases this is being done this way.

2256
03:08:34,415 --> 03:08:45,264
[SPEAKER_00]: With Salem Street already done, my building is already rezoned despite similar consideration pushed back in March as many of the people here that got overlooked and disregarded by Matt Leming once it was sent back to council.

2257
03:08:45,384 --> 03:08:48,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Neighbors are now nervous and getting solicited from developers.

2258
03:08:49,207 --> 03:08:55,871
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already a demolition petition for an 1800s home on the opposite opposite side of the river from Medford square at 16 Manning street.

2259
03:08:56,832 --> 03:09:08,779
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to reinforce the mayor's comments as a trained civil engineer with training in planning that the city is not prepared to move forward as is and for reference, a new memo has gone to the city board tonight to shed some light on whose responsibility it is.

2260
03:09:09,339 --> 03:09:15,304
[SPEAKER_00]: to manage the inventories of measures and commission the necessary city agencies to carry them out and return those measures.

2261
03:09:15,784 --> 03:09:19,107
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on common practice, she happens to be sitting in the room tonight at the dais.

2262
03:09:19,387 --> 03:09:19,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2263
03:09:22,730 --> 03:09:23,390
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Zachary.

2264
03:09:30,056 --> 03:09:33,779
[SPEAKER_58]: Our next commenter is in person, Andrew Pancic.

2265
03:09:37,561 --> 03:09:38,082
[SPEAKER_58]: Is Andrew here?

2266
03:09:38,911 --> 03:09:39,691
[SPEAKER_58]: All right, we'll come back.

2267
03:09:42,412 --> 03:09:42,653
[SPEAKER_58]: What?

2268
03:09:43,253 --> 03:09:47,174
[SPEAKER_58]: Sorry.

2269
03:09:47,214 --> 03:09:50,936
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to... What?

2270
03:09:51,776 --> 03:09:52,697
[SPEAKER_58]: I just told her to sign up.

2271
03:09:52,737 --> 03:09:53,137
[SPEAKER_58]: She won't.

2272
03:09:54,317 --> 03:09:55,878
[SPEAKER_58]: Oh.

2273
03:09:55,918 --> 03:09:56,978
[SPEAKER_58]: I mean, she can comment now.

2274
03:09:56,998 --> 03:09:58,179
[SPEAKER_58]: I mean, that's great.

2275
03:09:58,199 --> 03:09:59,599
[SPEAKER_58]: Because I don't remember her.

2276
03:10:04,636 --> 03:10:06,342
[SPEAKER_58]: Oh my God, thank you so much for coming.

2277
03:10:06,362 --> 03:10:07,788
[SPEAKER_58]: This is amazing.

2278
03:10:07,868 --> 03:10:08,711
[SPEAKER_58]: Paulette, come on up.

2279
03:10:12,865 --> 03:10:16,246
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, I'm Paulette Vartabedian, Central Ave, Medford.

2280
03:10:17,106 --> 03:10:20,527
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to make some comments about some of the earlier speakers.

2281
03:10:21,567 --> 03:10:29,469
[SPEAKER_22]: A young man, Eric, called the people that didn't want this proposal, or at least in its current form, NIMBYs.

2282
03:10:29,969 --> 03:10:38,771
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's a really insulting thing to say because it's not only dividing the city, but they don't know why we don't want this plan.

2283
03:10:39,031 --> 03:10:42,572
[SPEAKER_22]: So to say that NIMBYs, like we were called that originally,

2284
03:10:42,892 --> 03:10:43,392
[SPEAKER_22]: the city of West Medford.

2285
03:10:43,412 --> 03:10:45,894
[SPEAKER_22]: We had a meeting last year for the methadone things.

2286
03:10:46,534 --> 03:10:49,436
[SPEAKER_22]: The people in West Medford were calling us NIMBYs.

2287
03:10:49,736 --> 03:10:54,799
[SPEAKER_22]: But now all of a sudden, when change is happening in their neighborhood, who's the NIMBY then?

2288
03:10:55,319 --> 03:10:58,841
[SPEAKER_22]: But that's... Please, people, don't use that word.

2289
03:10:59,081 --> 03:11:00,342
[SPEAKER_22]: It's dividing the city.

2290
03:11:03,303 --> 03:11:03,844
[SPEAKER_22]: Medford.

2291
03:11:04,304 --> 03:11:06,246
[SPEAKER_22]: The other thing someone mentioned Glenwood.

2292
03:11:07,007 --> 03:11:10,911
[SPEAKER_22]: My family has lived in Glenwood and owned homes for over 100 years.

2293
03:11:11,312 --> 03:11:13,815
[SPEAKER_22]: I've lived in my current home 71 years.

2294
03:11:14,355 --> 03:11:18,099
[SPEAKER_22]: I know what is and what was Glenwood before.

2295
03:11:18,520 --> 03:11:20,942
[SPEAKER_22]: There were no restaurants in Glenwood.

2296
03:11:21,743 --> 03:11:25,285
[SPEAKER_22]: basically it is now what it was then.

2297
03:11:25,745 --> 03:11:28,587
[SPEAKER_22]: There were maybe a barbershop or things like that.

2298
03:11:28,627 --> 03:11:33,409
[SPEAKER_22]: There were no major restaurants, so wherever he's getting that information is incorrect.

2299
03:11:34,089 --> 03:11:34,910
[SPEAKER_22]: Another thing that

2300
03:11:35,982 --> 03:11:40,524
[SPEAKER_22]: has been tossed around for the people in Glenwood is that we don't want change.

2301
03:11:40,924 --> 03:11:42,045
[SPEAKER_22]: That is incorrect.

2302
03:11:42,605 --> 03:11:48,748
[SPEAKER_22]: Everyone that I've spoken to, and there've been many, many, including me, is that we're not opposed to the change.

2303
03:11:48,768 --> 03:11:52,289
[SPEAKER_22]: We're opposed to the excessive change.

2304
03:11:52,669 --> 03:11:54,710
[SPEAKER_22]: We're okay with the three to four stories.

2305
03:11:55,010 --> 03:11:55,991
[SPEAKER_22]: It needs to happen.

2306
03:11:56,231 --> 03:12:02,174
[SPEAKER_22]: Salem Street needs to be redeveloped, but to go up to six, maybe 12 stories is just ridiculous.

2307
03:12:02,934 --> 03:12:05,015
[SPEAKER_22]: And also this needs to slow down.

2308
03:12:05,675 --> 03:12:09,917
[SPEAKER_22]: as I've mentioned before, the idea is like the hub of the wheel.

2309
03:12:10,317 --> 03:12:13,398
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you have all the spokes that goes out to the wheel.

2310
03:12:13,758 --> 03:12:22,202
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to know what the impact of each of those spokes are to really have a comprehensive plan that is successful.

2311
03:12:22,642 --> 03:12:33,907
[SPEAKER_22]: And the other thing, just real quick, is that I find it really appalling that six out of the seven Councilors feel that they can speak for the whole city of Medford because quote, quote, we voted for them.

2312
03:12:34,427 --> 03:12:36,537
[SPEAKER_22]: That is what we get and we've also heard.

2313
03:12:37,623 --> 03:12:43,848
[SPEAKER_22]: with our own ears, people saying that, well, if you don't like it, you can always sell your house and move.

2314
03:12:44,168 --> 03:12:45,689
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not why we live in Medford.

2315
03:12:45,729 --> 03:12:53,374
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't live in Medford to just have our home that we've made beautiful and lovely and say, oh, I don't like it.

2316
03:12:53,454 --> 03:12:54,735
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just gonna sell it and move.

2317
03:12:54,976 --> 03:12:58,138
[SPEAKER_22]: That is so insulting coming from a city council person.

2318
03:12:58,298 --> 03:12:59,419
[SPEAKER_58]: Paulette, I'm gonna ask you to wrap up.

2319
03:12:59,479 --> 03:13:00,540
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, but thank you very much.

2320
03:13:00,580 --> 03:13:02,721
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm sorry that I couldn't get through.

2321
03:13:02,741 --> 03:13:05,103
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna have to have a five-year-old show me how to do it.

2322
03:13:05,583 --> 03:13:06,824
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you so much for coming down.

2323
03:13:06,844 --> 03:13:07,805
[SPEAKER_58]: We really appreciate it.

2324
03:13:07,825 --> 03:13:13,830
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you for your effort there.

2325
03:13:24,117 --> 03:13:24,798
[SPEAKER_58]: Michael Corbett.

2326
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:27,680
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi, Michael.

2327
03:13:27,880 --> 03:13:28,281
[SPEAKER_58]: Welcome back.

2328
03:13:30,516 --> 03:13:31,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi again, good to see you all.

2329
03:13:32,158 --> 03:13:34,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Michael Corbett, 26 Jackson Road.

2330
03:13:35,281 --> 03:13:42,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I will save my detailed comments through email because I'm sure that's easier to digest and give you lots of good stuff that's specific and measurable.

2331
03:13:43,130 --> 03:13:51,219
[SPEAKER_15]: But what I want to focus on is a simple question that I've spent the last three and a half weeks trying to figure out the answer to, and I want to see if I got it right.

2332
03:13:52,401 --> 03:14:01,131
[SPEAKER_15]: So my first thing that came to my mind when I learned about this zoning is I want to know what the process is, I want to know who has decision rights, and I want to know what the schedule is.

2333
03:14:01,151 --> 03:14:03,914
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't find that on the website.

2334
03:14:04,414 --> 03:14:10,822
[SPEAKER_15]: I reached out to the City Council, the Community Development Board, the Mayor, did not get those questions answered.

2335
03:14:11,282 --> 03:14:23,110
[SPEAKER_15]: through a series of conversations with neighbors, city councilors, residents of Salem Street, reading multiple websites, including Mass General Laws, have pieced together the following.

2336
03:14:23,150 --> 03:14:26,131
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to know if I got it right.

2337
03:14:27,412 --> 03:14:38,039
[SPEAKER_15]: The city council subcommittee for planning and permitting worked with Innis to come up with a proposal that then went to the city council to be voted to the CDB.

2338
03:14:38,439 --> 03:14:39,120
[SPEAKER_15]: So I got that right.

2339
03:14:39,780 --> 03:14:50,850
[SPEAKER_15]: CDB then works with the community to solicit public comment, revise that proposal based on public comment, and then send it back to the city council.

2340
03:14:52,145 --> 03:14:52,505
[SPEAKER_15]: is that correct?

2341
03:14:52,525 --> 03:14:53,546
[SPEAKER_15]: With our recommendations.

2342
03:14:53,866 --> 03:14:54,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Recommendations, correct.

2343
03:14:55,247 --> 03:15:06,633
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the City Council has unilateral decision power to do whatever they want, whether that is the CBB proposal or the original City Council proposal, is that correct?

2344
03:15:07,174 --> 03:15:08,475
[SPEAKER_58]: 30 seconds, and yes, you're correct.

2345
03:15:08,635 --> 03:15:09,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

2346
03:15:09,975 --> 03:15:13,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think our constituents in this city realize that.

2347
03:15:14,358 --> 03:15:25,149
[SPEAKER_15]: that we could be doing multiple public hearings like this and the same exact, pardon my words, bullshit that happened to Salem Street could happen to other communities in this city.

2348
03:15:25,730 --> 03:15:30,495
[SPEAKER_15]: So I urge everyone listening on Zoom, reach out to the city council.

2349
03:15:30,675 --> 03:15:31,656
[SPEAKER_15]: This is unacceptable.

2350
03:15:31,836 --> 03:15:34,959
[SPEAKER_15]: They have unilateral power to do whatever they want on this issue.

2351
03:15:35,219 --> 03:15:35,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2352
03:15:43,192 --> 03:15:44,973
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Michael, and I appreciate that.

2353
03:15:50,496 --> 03:15:55,558
[SPEAKER_58]: Do we have any other in-person commenters that did not sign up, have not already spoken?

2354
03:15:55,578 --> 03:15:58,220
[SPEAKER_58]: Welcome back.

2355
03:16:00,541 --> 03:16:03,142
[SPEAKER_58]: Hey, Anne, how's it going?

2356
03:16:05,088 --> 03:16:05,308
[SPEAKER_58]: Good.

2357
03:16:06,169 --> 03:16:06,909
[SPEAKER_58]: No dog this time.

2358
03:16:07,949 --> 03:16:08,690
[SPEAKER_63]: I know, I'm sad.

2359
03:16:09,750 --> 03:16:11,071
[SPEAKER_63]: Okay, can you hear me?

2360
03:16:11,431 --> 03:16:12,732
[SPEAKER_63]: Yes, thank you.

2361
03:16:12,852 --> 03:16:13,932
[SPEAKER_63]: First, thank you guys.

2362
03:16:14,252 --> 03:16:25,137
[SPEAKER_63]: It's a lot of work that you're doing, and I feel, and I hope everybody else who's been here feels listened to on all sides, because it does seem like you guys care about what we feel.

2363
03:16:27,378 --> 03:16:31,641
[SPEAKER_63]: And it's an important thing for everybody to be involved with.

2364
03:16:31,681 --> 03:16:34,383
[SPEAKER_63]: I still think there's some people who don't know this is going on.

2365
03:16:36,405 --> 03:16:37,986
[SPEAKER_63]: So I was just wondering, I had a question.

2366
03:16:38,706 --> 03:16:54,638
[SPEAKER_63]: Is this something that we could have like a citizen group, kind of like what they did with the charter review, where some individuals on both sides, renters, homeowners, members of government, whatever, come together kind of

2367
03:16:55,278 --> 03:17:02,142
[SPEAKER_63]: do a little bit of a deep dive to help because I don't think we're opposed to zoning changes.

2368
03:17:02,722 --> 03:17:04,743
[SPEAKER_63]: It's like what I think Paulette said.

2369
03:17:05,704 --> 03:17:10,226
[SPEAKER_63]: It's to some level the degree of proposed changes.

2370
03:17:11,687 --> 03:17:14,529
[SPEAKER_63]: And just throwing that out there as a suggestion.

2371
03:17:16,450 --> 03:17:16,770
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you.

2372
03:17:16,950 --> 03:17:17,210
[SPEAKER_58]: That's it.

2373
03:17:19,752 --> 03:17:20,132
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Anne.

2374
03:17:20,152 --> 03:17:22,253
[SPEAKER_58]: I appreciate the very thoughtful and specific suggestion.

2375
03:17:30,152 --> 03:17:32,314
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go back to our Zoom commenters.

2376
03:17:33,295 --> 03:17:34,415
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Cheryl Rodriguez.

2377
03:17:35,836 --> 03:17:37,578
[SPEAKER_58]: Cheryl, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

2378
03:17:40,460 --> 03:17:40,940
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi, Cheryl.

2379
03:17:41,621 --> 03:17:41,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

2380
03:17:42,432 --> 03:17:44,493
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

2381
03:17:44,773 --> 03:17:47,914
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm gonna try to be as quick as I can and specific.

2382
03:17:48,334 --> 03:17:52,636
[SPEAKER_10]: The zoning is unstudied and should not move forward without our requisite studies and analysis.

2383
03:17:52,696 --> 03:17:57,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Gathering public input is great and one part of the process, but not the entire process.

2384
03:17:58,158 --> 03:18:03,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a resident of Glenwood and we are being inappropriately upzoned despite the lack of study.

2385
03:18:03,580 --> 03:18:06,381
[SPEAKER_10]: It is obvious that too much density is being focused here.

2386
03:18:06,861 --> 03:18:11,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I live next door to a mega townhouse that extends into my yard and overlooks my pool

2387
03:18:12,143 --> 03:18:14,506
[SPEAKER_10]: and shades part of my yard as well.

2388
03:18:15,066 --> 03:18:23,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Now with more lot coverage allowed and smaller setbacks, I can look forward to three units next door that can look into my yard and blot out more sun.

2389
03:18:23,576 --> 03:18:28,221
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't mean I dislike my neighbors, but that project decreased my privacy and quality of life.

2390
03:18:28,992 --> 03:18:36,277
[SPEAKER_10]: The majority of the area is being zoned NR3, despite the south side of Salem Street being an SF2 zone.

2391
03:18:36,677 --> 03:18:43,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the largest increase for an SF2 zone barring a section near the green line that is being zoned just one level higher.

2392
03:18:43,862 --> 03:18:48,124
[SPEAKER_10]: The north side is already very dense and parking can be difficult.

2393
03:18:48,485 --> 03:18:49,926
[SPEAKER_10]: There are many narrow streets.

2394
03:18:50,526 --> 03:18:53,428
[SPEAKER_10]: The majority of Glenwood is single and two family homes.

2395
03:18:53,948 --> 03:18:58,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Glenwood is facing, as Alicia Hunt, the director of planning and permitting calls it,

2396
03:18:58,611 --> 03:19:00,053
[SPEAKER_10]: quote, developer pressure.

2397
03:19:00,613 --> 03:19:06,979
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is actually rapid gentrification by flippers that will be worsened with an NR3 designation.

2398
03:19:07,599 --> 03:19:17,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Glenwood is also home to a large number of UR2 zones, which the board has suggested adding an additional floor to as they are close to rapid transit.

2399
03:19:17,648 --> 03:19:21,892
[SPEAKER_10]: But Glenwood is not on rapid transit.

2400
03:19:21,932 --> 03:19:23,234
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one bus line.

2401
03:19:23,814 --> 03:19:25,174
[SPEAKER_10]: and that is not rapid transit.

2402
03:19:25,234 --> 03:19:35,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Your two zones include one side of Riverside Ave, which allows no parking, one side of Fulton, which allows parking on one side, and both sides of Fulton Ave, which is a narrow dead end.

2403
03:19:35,997 --> 03:19:38,618
[SPEAKER_10]: The majority of these homes are single and two family homes.

2404
03:19:38,698 --> 03:19:47,340
[SPEAKER_10]: None are near rapid transit and do not contain any parking buildings, but are being zoned for them as the lots were too small and the area is already thickly settled.

2405
03:19:48,648 --> 03:19:51,189
[SPEAKER_10]: We urge you to study and consider the impacts in Glenwood.

2406
03:19:51,229 --> 03:19:59,012
[SPEAKER_10]: We will be harmed by the grossly dense Salem Street corridor and the future reduction of on-street parking on Salem Street currently planned by the city.

2407
03:19:59,412 --> 03:20:02,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do not allow us to be victimized again by this zoning.

2408
03:20:02,314 --> 03:20:05,775
[SPEAKER_10]: We are a neighborhood and we would like to retain some quality of life.

2409
03:20:06,255 --> 03:20:08,236
[SPEAKER_10]: So please help us as much as you can.

2410
03:20:08,416 --> 03:20:08,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2411
03:20:08,856 --> 03:20:11,117
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Cheryl.

2412
03:20:13,858 --> 03:20:15,739
[SPEAKER_58]: Our next Zoom commenter is Sam Robinson.

2413
03:20:21,092 --> 03:20:21,532
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi, Sam.

2414
03:20:23,933 --> 03:20:25,813
[SPEAKER_58]: Oh, if you're talking, I can't hear you, unfortunately.

2415
03:20:25,833 --> 03:20:35,435
[SPEAKER_58]: Want to try again?

2416
03:20:35,455 --> 03:20:35,495
[SPEAKER_58]: OK.

2417
03:20:42,736 --> 03:20:46,697
[SPEAKER_58]: I sent through another unmute request, because I think when you change your audio, I have to unmute you again.

2418
03:20:52,412 --> 03:20:53,533
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm still not hearing anything.

2419
03:20:54,594 --> 03:20:55,835
[SPEAKER_58]: Sam, is it okay if we come back to you?

2420
03:21:12,849 --> 03:21:14,050
[SPEAKER_58]: Sam, Alicia's going to message you.

2421
03:21:14,650 --> 03:21:16,652
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to go to the next Zoom speaker, and then we'll come back.

2422
03:21:17,613 --> 03:21:19,955
[SPEAKER_58]: But we'll make sure your comment gets incorporated.

2423
03:21:23,462 --> 03:21:27,105
[SPEAKER_58]: The next commenter that we have is Lisa Falanga.

2424
03:21:27,666 --> 03:21:28,647
[SPEAKER_58]: Lisa, I'm going to unmute you.

2425
03:21:30,528 --> 03:21:30,888
[SPEAKER_39]: Hi, guys.

2426
03:21:31,209 --> 03:21:32,470
[SPEAKER_39]: I am totally opposed to this.

2427
03:21:32,490 --> 03:21:36,113
[SPEAKER_39]: So I am in the South Street zoning.

2428
03:21:36,973 --> 03:21:40,596
[SPEAKER_39]: And I have been here for 30 some odd years.

2429
03:21:40,676 --> 03:21:45,560
[SPEAKER_39]: My husband grew up in Medford and has lived here his entire life.

2430
03:21:46,001 --> 03:21:46,942
[SPEAKER_39]: I disagree with that.

2431
03:21:47,102 --> 03:21:51,886
[SPEAKER_39]: I think that anybody who is in support of it should come and live in my neighborhood.

2432
03:21:52,843 --> 03:21:58,010
[SPEAKER_39]: and stand in my street and lose their property value.

2433
03:21:58,931 --> 03:22:02,756
[SPEAKER_39]: So I heard a couple of people, I can't remember their names.

2434
03:22:04,478 --> 03:22:10,606
[SPEAKER_39]: I think it was, well, it says Erika DeRoche now, but I think it did not say that at the time.

2435
03:22:11,222 --> 03:22:20,825
[SPEAKER_39]: I think that person should come and live in my neighborhood and lose his property value or their property value and have to deal with it.

2436
03:22:21,266 --> 03:22:22,726
[SPEAKER_39]: It is inappropriate.

2437
03:22:23,806 --> 03:22:31,209
[SPEAKER_39]: Medford is not zoned for this, support this, and it cannot handle this.

2438
03:22:32,450 --> 03:22:39,152
[SPEAKER_39]: I am all for whatever we want to do if it's done right and appropriately.

2439
03:22:41,160 --> 03:22:42,961
[SPEAKER_39]: The school districts can't handle it.

2440
03:22:43,581 --> 03:22:48,983
[SPEAKER_39]: My kids couldn't even go to Medford school system because they couldn't handle it back 30 years ago.

2441
03:22:50,063 --> 03:22:51,644
[SPEAKER_39]: And they expect to handle it now.

2442
03:22:55,185 --> 03:22:59,567
[SPEAKER_39]: We just can't, we don't have the infrastructure, the police and the fire.

2443
03:23:00,887 --> 03:23:05,329
[SPEAKER_39]: How can you expect them to handle, we can't even handle Salem Street.

2444
03:23:06,886 --> 03:23:08,387
[SPEAKER_39]: Have you walked down Salem Street?

2445
03:23:08,447 --> 03:23:10,267
[SPEAKER_39]: It looks like a third world country.

2446
03:23:10,867 --> 03:23:16,949
[SPEAKER_39]: Salem Street is the main thoroughway through our city, and it looks like a third world country.

2447
03:23:17,809 --> 03:23:18,789
[SPEAKER_39]: Shame on Medford.

2448
03:23:19,229 --> 03:23:25,791
[SPEAKER_39]: It is not the Medford that I moved into, and it's not the Medford that we should be supporting.

2449
03:23:31,733 --> 03:23:32,753
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you for your comment, Lisa.

2450
03:23:40,405 --> 03:23:41,847
[SPEAKER_58]: Sam, we're going to try to come back to you.

2451
03:23:42,187 --> 03:23:42,968
[SPEAKER_58]: Sam Robinson.

2452
03:23:51,676 --> 03:23:53,738
[SPEAKER_58]: Sam, are you able to hear us and to speak?

2453
03:23:57,342 --> 03:23:59,664
[SPEAKER_58]: There may also be a phone number that you're able to dial into.

2454
03:24:04,807 --> 03:24:05,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, can you hear me?

2455
03:24:06,368 --> 03:24:06,608
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

2456
03:24:07,649 --> 03:24:10,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Sam, thanks for your persistence.

2457
03:24:11,111 --> 03:24:12,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I'm Sam Robinson.

2458
03:24:12,532 --> 03:24:14,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on 31 Everett Street in Glenwood neighborhood.

2459
03:24:15,654 --> 03:24:20,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I do support the proposed rezoning and I am against parking minimums.

2460
03:24:21,538 --> 03:24:25,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time to attend these meetings, but I just wanted my voice to be heard.

2461
03:24:31,044 --> 03:24:31,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2462
03:24:32,833 --> 03:24:33,413
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Sam.

2463
03:24:33,813 --> 03:24:39,214
[SPEAKER_58]: And I encourage you to stay in the loop with Community Development Board meeting agendas.

2464
03:24:39,814 --> 03:24:48,576
[SPEAKER_58]: Because I believe that there is a I don't even know when City Council proposal about parking coming across our desks.

2465
03:24:49,236 --> 03:24:49,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2466
03:24:50,697 --> 03:24:51,917
[SPEAKER_58]: There's no short term plan.

2467
03:24:52,617 --> 03:24:55,218
[SPEAKER_58]: But just kind of stay in the loop on that.

2468
03:24:55,238 --> 03:24:56,898
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, thank you tonight.

2469
03:25:01,817 --> 03:25:06,999
[SPEAKER_58]: Our next speaker through Zoom is Carrie Hewlett.

2470
03:25:07,019 --> 03:25:09,299
[SPEAKER_74]: Hi, thank you for taking my comment.

2471
03:25:09,359 --> 03:25:09,979
[SPEAKER_74]: I appreciate it.

2472
03:25:11,260 --> 03:25:14,601
[SPEAKER_74]: I generally am very much in favor of denser zoning.

2473
03:25:14,681 --> 03:25:21,463
[SPEAKER_74]: So I think in principle, I would be in favor of what is being proposed, but I haven't had the chance to look at it closely.

2474
03:25:21,523 --> 03:25:23,983
[SPEAKER_74]: So I'm sure there would be things that I would have to say about it.

2475
03:25:24,043 --> 03:25:29,985
[SPEAKER_74]: But as a person who's new to this process, and I've just been learning tonight on this call, and I was also in the chamber earlier,

2476
03:25:30,667 --> 03:25:37,790
[SPEAKER_74]: The thing that I'm missing is someone who would start off the meeting by saying why we are doing this in the first place.

2477
03:25:38,090 --> 03:25:54,055
[SPEAKER_74]: So someone who could actually lay out some of the details of the actual plan why we're doing it what some of the benefits would be or could be or should be that would be helpful for someone like me who's new to the process and is trying to catch up.

2478
03:25:54,095 --> 03:25:58,357
[SPEAKER_74]: And I understand I am confident you've done it before in other meetings but if we're having multiple

2479
03:25:58,697 --> 03:26:16,461
[SPEAKER_74]: hearings, I think even 10 minutes at the beginning of the process to explain the origin of the plan, of the planning process, that it came to the city council, what the reasoning was, and someone who could at least do the explanation of why it's being done at all would be super helpful in future meetings.

2480
03:26:16,661 --> 03:26:19,802
[SPEAKER_74]: So thank you everyone for your help and for all the work you're doing.

2481
03:26:21,523 --> 03:26:22,023
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Carrie.

2482
03:26:22,043 --> 03:26:22,763
[SPEAKER_58]: Appreciate the comment.

2483
03:26:34,340 --> 03:26:35,341
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, they did.

2484
03:26:38,783 --> 03:26:43,807
[SPEAKER_58]: So the next Zoom commenter that we have is Ernie Munier.

2485
03:26:45,028 --> 03:26:48,551
[SPEAKER_58]: And quick note, Ken Garrow, I might have accidentally lowered your hand.

2486
03:26:49,111 --> 03:26:51,673
[SPEAKER_58]: So if that was me, I'm sorry, please raise your hand again.

2487
03:26:52,194 --> 03:26:53,995
[SPEAKER_58]: But Ernie, we're going to go ahead and unmute you.

2488
03:26:55,857 --> 03:26:56,377
[SPEAKER_72]: Good evening.

2489
03:26:57,425 --> 03:26:57,845
[SPEAKER_72]: Hi, Ernie.

2490
03:26:58,025 --> 03:27:00,447
[SPEAKER_72]: Yeah, I'm Newton Road in West Medford.

2491
03:27:00,567 --> 03:27:01,688
[SPEAKER_72]: I wasn't going to speak.

2492
03:27:03,629 --> 03:27:13,615
[SPEAKER_72]: I am in opposition to the plan zoning scheme going forward as presented.

2493
03:27:14,236 --> 03:27:22,161
[SPEAKER_72]: I think that the entire view and structure of the changes should be

2494
03:27:23,628 --> 03:27:35,521
[SPEAKER_72]: bifurcated into ADUs and squares, and then the neighborhood residential areas later.

2495
03:27:36,763 --> 03:27:41,228
[SPEAKER_72]: When I first looked at the maps, I couldn't understand

2496
03:27:42,798 --> 03:27:52,845
[SPEAKER_72]: the differences between NR3, 2, and 1, except that they were just ripples by density from transit stations.

2497
03:27:53,485 --> 03:27:56,067
[SPEAKER_72]: And I thought that is incredibly coarse.

2498
03:27:57,308 --> 03:28:08,255
[SPEAKER_72]: It's almost like using a Norden bomb site in World War II and hoping you hit the munitions plants when you take out the residential units and you scatter plot your bombs.

2499
03:28:09,116 --> 03:28:11,538
[SPEAKER_72]: I know that's a weird reference, but that's the way it is.

2500
03:28:12,549 --> 03:28:22,435
[SPEAKER_72]: At the last public meeting, the CDB invited comments that were more granular about specific properties.

2501
03:28:23,635 --> 03:28:33,421
[SPEAKER_72]: And so my recommendation in invitation, because I don't think it's been done, is to ask board members

2502
03:28:34,361 --> 03:29:03,333
[SPEAKER_72]: and those who will be involved in screening specific neighborhoods to discern three from two from one, is to, as an example, walk up Playstead, walk up Sagamore Ave, and walk up Grove Street, and see that the character of the single-family homes there, their values, their magnificence or not,

2503
03:29:04,685 --> 03:29:25,756
[SPEAKER_72]: is not determined by their distance from a train station or even a corridor, but by many other factors and that decisions as to which are best allowed to be flippable.

2504
03:29:25,776 --> 03:29:29,678
[SPEAKER_58]: And I'm gonna ask you to wrap up your comment, please.

2505
03:29:30,262 --> 03:29:38,525
[SPEAKER_72]: Yes, in an effort to increase density, be very carefully and granularly done.

2506
03:29:40,295 --> 03:29:45,436
[SPEAKER_72]: Um, because it just doesn't pass the smell test right now.

2507
03:29:45,956 --> 03:30:00,799
[SPEAKER_72]: So once again, I recommend that we stop this and stress, uh, focus on the ADUs and the two squares and tackle neighborhood residential.

2508
03:30:01,099 --> 03:30:01,439
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm so sorry.

2509
03:30:01,499 --> 03:30:02,639
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm going to have to mute you.

2510
03:30:03,059 --> 03:30:03,740
[SPEAKER_72]: That's fine.

2511
03:30:03,980 --> 03:30:04,300
[SPEAKER_58]: Sorry.

2512
03:30:10,513 --> 03:30:13,676
[SPEAKER_58]: The next speaker we have through Zoom is Ken Garrow.

2513
03:30:13,956 --> 03:30:15,658
[SPEAKER_58]: Ken, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

2514
03:30:18,100 --> 03:30:18,480
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

2515
03:30:18,600 --> 03:30:20,982
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much, Ken Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

2516
03:30:21,863 --> 03:30:24,065
[SPEAKER_20]: For the record, you didn't actually raise my hand down.

2517
03:30:24,385 --> 03:30:29,649
[SPEAKER_20]: I was debating if I was going to speak at all, since I want to let other people have chances.

2518
03:30:30,430 --> 03:30:34,053
[SPEAKER_20]: But it does seem like several other people tonight who have spoken previously have spoken.

2519
03:30:35,054 --> 03:30:37,856
[SPEAKER_20]: Once again, I mostly support all of these changes.

2520
03:30:39,772 --> 03:30:44,035
[SPEAKER_20]: I do want to make one behavioral comment in general.

2521
03:30:44,075 --> 03:30:47,737
[SPEAKER_20]: There was an earlier commenter who felt affronted by being called a NIMBY.

2522
03:30:49,398 --> 03:31:02,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Over the past week, as the mayor has submitted several of her comments, I've been accused of hating the city, that I want to destroy it, that I have been in the pockets of developers.

2523
03:31:05,277 --> 03:31:07,118
[SPEAKER_20]: I think obviously I'm not there tonight.

2524
03:31:08,118 --> 03:31:10,159
[SPEAKER_20]: You've done a great job monitoring everything.

2525
03:31:11,239 --> 03:31:12,539
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand change is hard.

2526
03:31:14,520 --> 03:31:16,040
[SPEAKER_20]: We are still all living in this city.

2527
03:31:16,361 --> 03:31:20,822
[SPEAKER_20]: I bought my house here, my condo here six years ago.

2528
03:31:21,722 --> 03:31:25,844
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm doing this because I believe this is the best course of action moving the city forward.

2529
03:31:26,764 --> 03:31:33,186
[SPEAKER_20]: If we don't wanna do as much density in certain areas that I believe in, I am all for dropping some of those densities.

2530
03:31:34,055 --> 03:31:36,176
[SPEAKER_20]: I am fine changing things.

2531
03:31:36,536 --> 03:31:38,937
[SPEAKER_20]: I am not fine with leaving things as they are.

2532
03:31:40,158 --> 03:31:42,979
[SPEAKER_20]: I view this as a residential tax problem.

2533
03:31:43,119 --> 03:31:46,120
[SPEAKER_20]: I view this as a way to help address revenue.

2534
03:31:46,140 --> 03:31:51,242
[SPEAKER_20]: I view this as a way to help us increase business propositions in the area.

2535
03:31:52,763 --> 03:31:57,085
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I would just like to keep that in mind, right?

2536
03:31:58,225 --> 03:32:02,807
[SPEAKER_20]: I also actually, for actual granular comment, apologies for pontificating,

2537
03:32:03,780 --> 03:32:12,127
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I think an earlier commenter made the comment that if you made smaller single family zones, you would actually incentivize kind of these smaller houses.

2538
03:32:12,147 --> 03:32:14,308
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's actually a great idea.

2539
03:32:14,369 --> 03:32:29,160
[SPEAKER_20]: I think as much as I'm not a fan of NR1 existing as a zone, I think if we shrink the lot size, allow for some infill of smaller single family houses, that might be a reasonable compromise for us to move forward into.

2540
03:32:29,420 --> 03:32:30,221
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you so much.

2541
03:32:30,241 --> 03:32:30,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Have a great night.

2542
03:32:32,343 --> 03:32:32,703
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Ken.

2543
03:32:35,277 --> 03:32:37,918
[SPEAKER_58]: Our final commenter on Zoom is Caitlin.

2544
03:32:38,418 --> 03:32:40,339
[SPEAKER_58]: Caitlin, I'm gonna go ahead and unmute you.

2545
03:32:43,520 --> 03:32:44,360
[SPEAKER_76]: Hi, thank you.

2546
03:32:45,720 --> 03:32:48,201
[SPEAKER_76]: I'm Caitlin Robinson, 31 Everett Street.

2547
03:32:49,021 --> 03:32:50,362
[SPEAKER_76]: I support this proposal.

2548
03:32:50,882 --> 03:32:57,984
[SPEAKER_76]: It moves us towards sustainability, walkability, and a housing supply that meets a growing community's changing needs.

2549
03:32:58,804 --> 03:33:01,605
[SPEAKER_76]: I'm concerned about further delay for studies.

2550
03:33:02,265 --> 03:33:04,006
[SPEAKER_76]: There are already lots of studies

2551
03:33:04,513 --> 03:33:10,057
[SPEAKER_76]: about how existing harmful zoning policies were shaped and whose voices they are shaped by.

2552
03:33:10,557 --> 03:33:23,566
[SPEAKER_76]: There are studies about the negative impacts of exclusionary single family zoning, about the negative impacts of minimum parking requirements, and about the negative impacts of minimum lot size requirements.

2553
03:33:24,147 --> 03:33:31,572
[SPEAKER_76]: The existing zoning, which largely wouldn't have allowed most of the housing that currently exists in Medford,

2554
03:33:32,185 --> 03:33:39,392
[SPEAKER_76]: and that was built prior to these restrictive zoning rules, that existing zoning should not be looked at as being harmless.

2555
03:33:39,872 --> 03:33:40,292
[SPEAKER_76]: Thank you.

2556
03:33:43,575 --> 03:33:44,196
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you, Caitlin.

2557
03:34:05,160 --> 03:34:06,862
[SPEAKER_58]: We have one more Zoom commenter.

2558
03:34:07,002 --> 03:34:08,244
[SPEAKER_58]: We have Andrew McRobert.

2559
03:34:09,065 --> 03:34:10,987
[SPEAKER_58]: Andrew, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

2560
03:34:13,623 --> 03:34:16,505
[SPEAKER_70]: Hi there, Director Robert, 63 Kenmere Road.

2561
03:34:16,825 --> 03:34:17,685
[SPEAKER_70]: I'll keep this brief.

2562
03:34:17,785 --> 03:34:20,907
[SPEAKER_70]: I just want to go on the record in support of the zoning as it's proposed.

2563
03:34:21,587 --> 03:34:36,055
[SPEAKER_70]: And should this board decide not to move forward with this zoning, I encourage it to find a meaningful compromise that does increase density, housing density, and in some form.

2564
03:34:36,855 --> 03:34:37,495
[SPEAKER_70]: I'll leave it at that.

2565
03:34:37,555 --> 03:34:37,876
[SPEAKER_70]: Thanks.

2566
03:34:41,818 --> 03:34:42,338
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Andrew.

2567
03:34:43,733 --> 03:34:46,135
[SPEAKER_58]: We have another zoom commenter, Thomas Callahan.

2568
03:34:47,316 --> 03:34:48,857
[SPEAKER_58]: Thomas, I'm going to go ahead and unmute you.

2569
03:34:49,378 --> 03:34:49,678
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2570
03:34:49,938 --> 03:34:50,478
[SPEAKER_24]: Can you hear me?

2571
03:34:51,259 --> 03:34:51,759
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes, we can.

2572
03:34:51,799 --> 03:34:52,200
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

2573
03:34:52,600 --> 03:34:52,880
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2574
03:34:52,940 --> 03:34:53,341
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2575
03:34:54,161 --> 03:34:56,223
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, I've been listening to this whole thing tonight.

2576
03:34:56,263 --> 03:35:07,352
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't plan on saying anything, but I have to say, um, this process is totally rushed and there's so many people don't even know about this.

2577
03:35:08,012 --> 03:35:11,455
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't know why we, why we would ever move forward to this.

2578
03:35:13,252 --> 03:35:20,618
[SPEAKER_24]: My neighborhood, if it is rezoned, to allow these changes is going to be ultimately changed completely.

2579
03:35:21,559 --> 03:35:23,861
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't have enough parking as it is.

2580
03:35:24,261 --> 03:35:34,490
[SPEAKER_24]: How is it that a house that is now a single family home is now going to be allowed to be three, four, five, six units?

2581
03:35:34,770 --> 03:35:36,452
[SPEAKER_24]: It's absolutely ridiculous.

2582
03:35:36,592 --> 03:35:37,793
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't see how we can change

2583
03:35:41,633 --> 03:35:44,557
[SPEAKER_24]: in this way, the housing crisis that we have.

2584
03:35:44,918 --> 03:35:57,837
[SPEAKER_24]: Nobody is against zoning changes, but this is a rush process, completely flawed, and you're gonna double, triple the number of cars, people and dogs in our neighborhoods.

2585
03:35:58,761 --> 03:36:00,121
[SPEAKER_24]: What about private ways?

2586
03:36:00,562 --> 03:36:01,902
[SPEAKER_24]: What about infrastructure?

2587
03:36:02,402 --> 03:36:13,085
[SPEAKER_24]: What about what happens when the light, as it is when the light backs up down the street from my house, it's like the Indianapolis 500 going down my street in the afternoons and in the mornings.

2588
03:36:13,745 --> 03:36:15,126
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, this doesn't work.

2589
03:36:15,766 --> 03:36:16,686
[SPEAKER_24]: It's ridiculous.

2590
03:36:17,406 --> 03:36:18,767
[SPEAKER_24]: This needs to start over.

2591
03:36:19,487 --> 03:36:24,908
[SPEAKER_24]: And people have to be informed about these changes and no one is against changing zoning.

2592
03:36:25,008 --> 03:36:25,388
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2593
03:36:25,408 --> 03:36:26,129
[SPEAKER_58]: 30 seconds.

2594
03:36:27,049 --> 03:36:27,529
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm all done.

2595
03:36:28,705 --> 03:36:29,347
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Thomas.

2596
03:36:29,488 --> 03:36:33,600
[SPEAKER_58]: I appreciate your comment and thank you for sticking around and adding your insight.

2597
03:36:37,517 --> 03:36:41,078
[SPEAKER_58]: Are there any other commenters in person that would like to speak?

2598
03:36:41,098 --> 03:36:42,558
[SPEAKER_58]: I think we've heard from everybody.

2599
03:36:43,439 --> 03:36:48,000
[SPEAKER_58]: So with that, I'm going to close the public comment for this meeting.

2600
03:36:49,360 --> 03:36:50,761
[SPEAKER_58]: Not forever, just for this meeting.

2601
03:36:52,541 --> 03:36:58,883
[SPEAKER_58]: And recognizing that it's 10.30 and I've been standing up here for over four hours, I need a quick bathroom break.

2602
03:36:59,803 --> 03:37:03,344
[SPEAKER_58]: Is it okay if the board takes a quick break?

2603
03:37:03,664 --> 03:37:04,325
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, great.

2604
03:37:04,565 --> 03:37:05,385
[SPEAKER_58]: We'll be back in five.

2605
03:37:10,734 --> 03:37:11,321
[SPEAKER_64]: Hard to say.

2606
03:37:25,242 --> 03:37:31,066
[SPEAKER_58]: All right, so we've closed the public comment period for this meeting on the aforementioned topics.

2607
03:37:31,146 --> 03:37:35,729
[SPEAKER_58]: What I'd like to do now is open it up to the board for further questions and discussions.

2608
03:37:36,810 --> 03:37:44,435
[SPEAKER_58]: But what I want to remind the board is that we had decided that this meeting was to hear additional public comment.

2609
03:37:45,912 --> 03:37:49,959
[SPEAKER_58]: We got through the queue that was on zoom in person.

2610
03:37:49,979 --> 03:37:54,887
[SPEAKER_58]: We didn't hit everybody that had signed up on the 18th, because you know some people didn't come back.

2611
03:37:56,570 --> 03:37:58,333
[SPEAKER_58]: We're accepting written comment until July 23.

2612
03:38:00,303 --> 03:38:04,906
[SPEAKER_58]: and we are planning to deliberate and give direction to the consultant on August 6th.

2613
03:38:05,486 --> 03:38:28,398
[SPEAKER_58]: So my perspective is that what we should do is we should digest the public comments that we've received this evening rather than deliberate, continue to read through public comments, continue to receive written comments and stick with our decision to have our next discussions on August 6th and stick with the timeline that we have announced to the public.

2614
03:38:29,553 --> 03:38:31,514
[SPEAKER_58]: I see Peter's hand, but I'm also curious.

2615
03:38:32,534 --> 03:38:33,454
[SPEAKER_59]: Yeah.

2616
03:38:34,494 --> 03:38:34,774
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

2617
03:38:36,355 --> 03:38:49,558
[SPEAKER_41]: So I just I wanted to like sort of clarify the next step because there was sort of this rumor on the out in the public that the board was never taking any more public comment on this after July 23rd.

2618
03:38:49,978 --> 03:38:52,119
[SPEAKER_41]: So just to sort of mention that the idea was to

2619
03:38:53,339 --> 03:39:00,929
[SPEAKER_41]: Give direction to the consultant August 6 get a new version in September and take public comment on the new version.

2620
03:39:00,949 --> 03:39:09,219
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes, but that's just take a hiatus on public comments so that there's nothing new between early September and now.

2621
03:39:09,715 --> 03:39:13,036
[SPEAKER_41]: So people don't feel they need to be paying attention to all the changes.

2622
03:39:13,116 --> 03:39:16,737
[SPEAKER_41]: There won't be any changes until a new version comes out September.

2623
03:39:17,057 --> 03:39:25,038
[SPEAKER_41]: So I just wanna make sure that, cause it was very confusing to people who thought that this board was not taking any more public comment ever.

2624
03:39:25,319 --> 03:39:26,759
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, that's really helpful clarification.

2625
03:39:26,779 --> 03:39:27,539
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Alicia.

2626
03:39:27,599 --> 03:39:28,579
[SPEAKER_58]: And John, I see your hand.

2627
03:39:28,599 --> 03:39:36,101
[SPEAKER_40]: I think the reason for that was there was a robo call that I certainly heard it that way on the robo call.

2628
03:39:39,590 --> 03:39:44,231
[SPEAKER_41]: Sorry, the robocall texts were not all being run by me before they were made.

2629
03:39:44,652 --> 03:39:45,032
[SPEAKER_41]: Sorry.

2630
03:39:45,612 --> 03:39:46,592
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not personal.

2631
03:39:48,773 --> 03:39:51,794
[SPEAKER_58]: It's good to know kind of where the source of that information may have been.

2632
03:39:51,874 --> 03:39:52,534
[SPEAKER_58]: So thank you, John.

2633
03:39:53,694 --> 03:40:00,836
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm only subscribed to the texts, because like most millennials, they don't pick up my phone unless they recognize the number.

2634
03:40:01,977 --> 03:40:03,497
[SPEAKER_58]: OK, so Peter, I see your hand.

2635
03:40:04,337 --> 03:40:08,999
[SPEAKER_58]: Did you have any questions, discussion, any thoughts on what I just said?

2636
03:40:09,918 --> 03:40:11,999
[SPEAKER_69]: Oh, no, I was going to agree with what you said.

2637
03:40:12,019 --> 03:40:31,387
[SPEAKER_69]: I was going to say that we should take time to digest this information and any further public comment we may receive between now and the end of the month and reconvene on this issue to deliberate and provide direction to the consultant on the 6th.

2638
03:40:34,708 --> 03:40:38,050
[SPEAKER_58]: John, Ben, Sabrina, Ari,

2639
03:40:39,405 --> 03:40:41,266
[SPEAKER_58]: Adam, any thoughts?

2640
03:40:42,567 --> 03:40:43,027
[SPEAKER_40]: Agreed.

2641
03:40:43,107 --> 03:40:44,848
[SPEAKER_40]: Are we going to approve the minutes?

2642
03:40:45,628 --> 03:40:46,789
[SPEAKER_58]: That's a separate agenda item.

2643
03:40:46,849 --> 03:40:47,169
[SPEAKER_40]: OK, good.

2644
03:40:47,209 --> 03:40:49,390
[SPEAKER_58]: We're going to stick to this one for now.

2645
03:40:53,172 --> 03:40:57,213
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm ready to go home and see my dog, but we've got to do things in the right order in the right way.

2646
03:40:57,954 --> 03:40:59,915
[SPEAKER_58]: Ari, I heard support.

2647
03:41:01,015 --> 03:41:01,515
[SPEAKER_58]: Is that correct?

2648
03:41:01,696 --> 03:41:01,916
[SPEAKER_58]: Yep.

2649
03:41:03,236 --> 03:41:03,677
[SPEAKER_58]: Great, thank you.

2650
03:41:03,757 --> 03:41:06,378
[SPEAKER_58]: And I think I saw a thumbs up from Ben, thumbs up from John.

2651
03:41:07,382 --> 03:41:17,065
[SPEAKER_58]: All right, so what I'm going to look for is a motion to continue the hearings to a date certain.

2652
03:41:18,166 --> 03:41:21,147
[SPEAKER_58]: So for residential and ADU deliberation, that's August 6th.

2653
03:41:21,427 --> 03:41:23,168
[SPEAKER_58]: Do we have a date for the squares?

2654
03:41:24,968 --> 03:41:26,249
[SPEAKER_59]: I know I've seen something.

2655
03:41:34,844 --> 03:41:42,248
[SPEAKER_41]: Christian, can you message me the spreadsheet, the, sorry, the, you know what I mean?

2656
03:41:42,268 --> 03:41:44,590
[SPEAKER_58]: I can't talk if you understand me.

2657
03:41:44,770 --> 03:41:47,971
[SPEAKER_58]: The one that lists the planning, yeah.

2658
03:41:50,513 --> 03:41:51,013
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you.

2659
03:41:51,633 --> 03:41:53,234
[SPEAKER_58]: You said it's in our document?

2660
03:41:55,095 --> 03:41:57,757
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, you sent it via email.

2661
03:41:57,817 --> 03:41:58,877
[SPEAKER_59]: But you should get it to you.

2662
03:41:59,798 --> 03:42:01,019
[SPEAKER_59]: Send it to me via email.

2663
03:42:08,512 --> 03:42:21,403
[SPEAKER_58]: And then I'm also wondering, because what I'm hearing is, and I think it's a great suggestion to split the residential and ADU, almost similar to how we've talked about splitting the different squares.

2664
03:42:23,356 --> 03:42:25,238
[SPEAKER_58]: Is that a split that we need to decide tonight?

2665
03:42:27,660 --> 03:42:28,561
[SPEAKER_58]: I don't think so.

2666
03:42:28,641 --> 03:42:34,847
[SPEAKER_41]: So technically the ADUs and the residential are separate documents that you're reviewing.

2667
03:42:35,187 --> 03:42:37,769
[SPEAKER_41]: So they're legally separate already.

2668
03:42:37,789 --> 03:42:45,336
[SPEAKER_41]: And we had actually asked to bring the ADUs forward because we thought you needed to see them before deciding the residential piece.

2669
03:42:46,217 --> 03:42:48,160
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, so we don't need to do anything around that.

2670
03:42:48,240 --> 03:42:53,566
[SPEAKER_41]: So I have what I also have is all our planned potential meeting dates.

2671
03:42:57,732 --> 03:43:03,719
[SPEAKER_59]: Sorry.

2672
03:43:04,760 --> 03:43:05,161
[SPEAKER_59]: That's you.

2673
03:43:05,634 --> 03:43:13,035
[SPEAKER_59]: you guys decide, because it's open tonight and you guys have to continue the squares to a date certain and residential to a date certain.

2674
03:43:13,776 --> 03:43:24,718
[SPEAKER_59]: It is possible that the other corridors will get referred out of City Council next week, in which case we think you want to open that either the 6th or the 20th.

2675
03:43:26,038 --> 03:43:29,899
[SPEAKER_59]: There's also going to be a site plan review coming through.

2676
03:43:33,165 --> 03:43:36,306
[SPEAKER_59]: I met them today, and I didn't realize they were ready to talk.

2677
03:43:37,647 --> 03:43:38,507
OK.

2678
03:43:40,388 --> 03:43:43,069
[SPEAKER_59]: I just wanted you to know that I have your attention like this.

2679
03:43:43,669 --> 03:43:45,910
[SPEAKER_59]: I'm also going to be out of town on the 20th.

2680
03:43:46,170 --> 03:43:46,410
[SPEAKER_59]: Right.

2681
03:43:46,610 --> 03:43:47,750
[SPEAKER_59]: I mean, in theory, we can move.

2682
03:43:47,910 --> 03:43:49,371
[SPEAKER_59]: Oh, we don't have to do.

2683
03:43:49,411 --> 03:43:52,252
[SPEAKER_59]: So when to continue these has to be done tonight.

2684
03:43:52,432 --> 03:43:52,672
[SPEAKER_59]: OK.

2685
03:43:52,692 --> 03:43:55,313
[SPEAKER_59]: The thing you don't have to do tonight, we can do them for email.

2686
03:43:55,989 --> 03:43:57,210
[SPEAKER_59]: is the executive session.

2687
03:43:57,490 --> 03:44:01,893
[SPEAKER_59]: Janelle's asking to do a special meeting in 30 minutes on Zoom.

2688
03:44:01,933 --> 03:44:03,294
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes, next week or the week after.

2689
03:44:03,314 --> 03:44:06,156
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, we'll coordinate that with the board separately.

2690
03:44:06,356 --> 03:44:08,458
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay, so let's continue.

2691
03:44:08,478 --> 03:44:12,620
[SPEAKER_57]: So we're going to continue the residential and ADUs to the six.

2692
03:44:14,162 --> 03:44:17,224
[SPEAKER_57]: And then I'm going to say this louder into the microphone.

2693
03:44:17,684 --> 03:44:21,527
[SPEAKER_59]: And then we'll continue the squares to the

2694
03:44:23,550 --> 03:44:30,974
[SPEAKER_59]: The only problem with moving to other dates is that we can switch with planning and permitting, which is a problem for me and Daniela and her consultants.

2695
03:44:31,354 --> 03:44:31,614
[SPEAKER_59]: Yeah.

2696
03:44:31,994 --> 03:44:32,715
[SPEAKER_59]: So let's move all.

2697
03:44:34,596 --> 03:44:38,618
[SPEAKER_59]: I'm thinking continue with all of them to the sixth.

2698
03:44:39,318 --> 03:44:40,079
[SPEAKER_59]: You could do that.

2699
03:44:40,219 --> 03:44:40,499
[SPEAKER_59]: OK.

2700
03:44:42,060 --> 03:44:44,581
[SPEAKER_59]: And then you can decide if you want changes or go without.

2701
03:44:44,881 --> 03:44:45,141
[SPEAKER_59]: OK.

2702
03:44:45,161 --> 03:44:47,462
[SPEAKER_59]: Some of them, that's an option.

2703
03:44:48,143 --> 03:44:50,344
[SPEAKER_59]: I want to hear from Daniela and her consultants

2704
03:44:51,664 --> 03:44:56,308
[SPEAKER_59]: I just, I want, I want the six to be like so rich with deliberation.

2705
03:44:56,428 --> 03:44:56,688
[SPEAKER_57]: Right.

2706
03:44:58,349 --> 03:44:59,390
[SPEAKER_59]: Don't take public comment.

2707
03:44:59,510 --> 03:45:00,091
[SPEAKER_59]: Deliberate.

2708
03:45:00,191 --> 03:45:00,451
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes.

2709
03:45:00,491 --> 03:45:01,132
[SPEAKER_59]: And decide.

2710
03:45:01,332 --> 03:45:02,012
[SPEAKER_59]: You don't have to close.

2711
03:45:02,032 --> 03:45:03,633
[SPEAKER_59]: And I don't even want to talk about squares.

2712
03:45:05,075 --> 03:45:05,915
[SPEAKER_59]: Yeah.

2713
03:45:05,955 --> 03:45:10,639
[SPEAKER_59]: Wild pencil.

2714
03:45:10,719 --> 03:45:12,340
[SPEAKER_59]: It's going to be riveting.

2715
03:45:20,697 --> 03:45:21,037
[SPEAKER_59]: Okay.

2716
03:45:42,433 --> 03:45:52,475
[SPEAKER_58]: So through the joys of logistics, I think we need to continue the hearings for residential and ADU, West Medford and Medford Square all to August 6th.

2717
03:45:54,776 --> 03:45:56,416
[SPEAKER_58]: August 6th, yes.

2718
03:45:56,556 --> 03:45:58,676
[SPEAKER_58]: August 6th will be the board deliberation.

2719
03:46:02,157 --> 03:46:02,617
[SPEAKER_58]: What'd you say?

2720
03:46:05,078 --> 03:46:08,919
[SPEAKER_58]: Well, yes.

2721
03:46:09,499 --> 03:46:10,819
[SPEAKER_58]: That's a little auspicious, isn't it?

2722
03:46:14,810 --> 03:46:16,492
[SPEAKER_58]: So we're going to continue those to August 6th.

2723
03:46:18,875 --> 03:46:28,725
[SPEAKER_58]: And we may or may not talk about the squares, but we'll update agendas to reflect any change in that schedule.

2724
03:46:29,666 --> 03:46:30,648
[SPEAKER_58]: That's kind of the best we can do.

2725
03:46:31,288 --> 03:46:33,631
[SPEAKER_58]: And then for the executive session, we're going to coordinate

2726
03:46:37,268 --> 03:46:38,428
[SPEAKER_59]: schedule it over email.

2727
03:46:38,608 --> 03:46:40,869
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes, we're gonna schedule it over email with the board.

2728
03:46:40,889 --> 03:46:44,009
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, Alicia's gonna take it.

2729
03:46:44,109 --> 03:46:52,831
[SPEAKER_41]: So I talked to our lawyer and she said it would be best if we could just do a short Zoom executive session sometime in the next week or two.

2730
03:46:53,271 --> 03:47:00,533
[SPEAKER_41]: So I was gonna have probably Danielle or myself email you all tomorrow to figure out the scheduling on that.

2731
03:47:01,633 --> 03:47:05,114
[SPEAKER_58]: And with that executive session, if it's through Zoom, it'll still be publicly advertised.

2732
03:47:05,394 --> 03:47:06,054
[SPEAKER_58]: We'll open in,

2733
03:47:07,904 --> 03:47:13,507
[SPEAKER_58]: public meeting, convene into executive session, and then vote out of executive session.

2734
03:47:14,328 --> 03:47:17,949
[SPEAKER_41]: Right, there'll be nothing that would prohibit you from also talking in the public.

2735
03:47:18,850 --> 03:47:21,611
[SPEAKER_41]: It's just that you would, right, you would ask for that.

2736
03:47:21,751 --> 03:47:28,975
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, I just want to clarify that, you know, if anybody does want to join that Zoom, we'll follow our normal kind of like a Zoom procedure.

2737
03:47:32,610 --> 03:47:33,711
[SPEAKER_58]: Any other questions?

2738
03:47:34,471 --> 03:47:41,614
[SPEAKER_40]: I wonder if you could just send out an email with the dates you've set for what we're discussing.

2739
03:47:41,674 --> 03:47:45,196
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, and I would like to have it as a visual for our next meeting as well.

2740
03:47:45,256 --> 03:47:45,696
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm sorry?

2741
03:47:45,856 --> 03:47:49,858
[SPEAKER_58]: I would like to have it as a visual for our next meeting, even if it's just a Word doc or a spreadsheet.

2742
03:47:51,779 --> 03:47:53,199
[SPEAKER_59]: No, not right now.

2743
03:47:55,600 --> 03:47:59,182
[SPEAKER_58]: But yeah, that's a good point, whether it's the board members or the public.

2744
03:48:00,336 --> 03:48:04,097
[SPEAKER_58]: Any other questions from my Zoomers?

2745
03:48:06,678 --> 03:48:07,319
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm seeing none.

2746
03:48:08,539 --> 03:48:21,644
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, so what I'm looking for is a motion to continue the hearings for Neighborhood and Urban Residential, AGU, Medford Square, and West Medford Square to August 6th.

2747
03:48:23,385 --> 03:48:24,425
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm looking for that motion.

2748
03:48:28,266 --> 03:48:29,687
[SPEAKER_58]: John has the motion, can I get a second?

2749
03:48:30,367 --> 03:48:30,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

2750
03:48:31,487 --> 03:48:31,987
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Peter.

2751
03:48:32,007 --> 03:48:32,988
[SPEAKER_58]: We're gonna do roll call vote.

2752
03:48:33,028 --> 03:48:34,068
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm gonna call him as I see him.

2753
03:48:34,688 --> 03:48:35,328
[SPEAKER_58]: John Anderson?

2754
03:48:36,348 --> 03:48:36,628
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

2755
03:48:37,309 --> 03:48:37,889
[SPEAKER_58]: Ben LaValle?

2756
03:48:38,829 --> 03:48:38,909
Aye.

2757
03:48:40,049 --> 03:48:40,609
[SPEAKER_58]: Peter Kalbs?

2758
03:48:41,590 --> 03:48:41,690
[SPEAKER_40]: Aye.

2759
03:48:44,010 --> 03:48:44,790
[SPEAKER_58]: Sabrina Alpino?

2760
03:48:45,591 --> 03:48:45,711
[SPEAKER_58]: Aye.

2761
03:48:46,831 --> 03:48:47,711
[SPEAKER_58]: Ari Goffman-Fishman?

2762
03:48:48,991 --> 03:48:49,131
[SPEAKER_38]: Aye.

2763
03:48:50,712 --> 03:48:51,292
[SPEAKER_58]: Adam Behrens?

2764
03:49:00,999 --> 03:49:11,067
[SPEAKER_59]: All right, we lost Adam.

2765
03:49:12,128 --> 03:49:17,233
[SPEAKER_58]: And then I, myself, Emily Hedeman, am also an I. That's everyone, right?

2766
03:49:18,314 --> 03:49:18,674
[SPEAKER_58]: That's here.

2767
03:49:20,095 --> 03:49:20,736
[SPEAKER_58]: All right, great.

2768
03:49:20,956 --> 03:49:21,997
[SPEAKER_58]: So now we have minutes.

2769
03:49:24,679 --> 03:49:30,822
[SPEAKER_58]: And before we move into minutes, just thank you so much to everybody that's here in person in the chambers or on zoom.

2770
03:49:31,662 --> 03:49:40,166
[SPEAKER_58]: We really appreciate your thoughtful and meaningful comments to help us through this process.

2771
03:49:40,486 --> 03:49:41,187
[SPEAKER_58]: So thank you.

2772
03:49:44,288 --> 03:49:45,469
[SPEAKER_58]: So the next item we have is minutes.

2773
03:49:45,869 --> 03:49:49,811
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm looking for a motion to accept the minutes from June 18th and June 25th.

2774
03:49:53,393 --> 03:49:54,774
[SPEAKER_40]: Can I make one request?

2775
03:49:55,054 --> 03:49:56,035
[SPEAKER_58]: Yes.

2776
03:49:56,215 --> 03:50:02,600
[SPEAKER_40]: First, let me complicate, excuse me, compliment Christian for taking such excellent minutes.

2777
03:50:04,461 --> 03:50:07,583
[SPEAKER_40]: How you can record all that so quickly is amazing.

2778
03:50:08,744 --> 03:50:21,813
[SPEAKER_40]: I would suggest on the 18th minutes, right around towards the bottom, after it says board member Lavallee agreed that looking at squares and corridors, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then you start

2779
03:50:22,602 --> 03:50:23,843
[SPEAKER_40]: start talking about dates.

2780
03:50:24,624 --> 03:50:31,969
[SPEAKER_40]: It's a little bit hard to figure out which proposals are being referred to when the dates are mentioned.

2781
03:50:31,989 --> 03:50:32,609
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay.

2782
03:50:36,152 --> 03:50:38,714
[SPEAKER_57]: Do you have proposed language for revision?

2783
03:50:44,602 --> 03:50:52,946
[SPEAKER_57]: What we could do is we could not accept those minutes and then maybe kind of go back on those.

2784
03:50:53,246 --> 03:50:55,848
[SPEAKER_58]: Yeah, that'd be great.

2785
03:50:55,888 --> 03:50:56,168
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay.

2786
03:50:56,348 --> 03:51:00,450
[SPEAKER_58]: Did anybody have any comments for the minutes on the 25th, June 25th?

2787
03:51:02,851 --> 03:51:03,251
[SPEAKER_58]: Seeing none.

2788
03:51:03,271 --> 03:51:06,373
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, so I'm gonna look for a motion to accept the minutes from June 25th, 2025.

2789
03:51:06,433 --> 03:51:07,513
[SPEAKER_58]: Oh, yeah, Christian?

2790
03:51:17,217 --> 03:51:30,222
[SPEAKER_32]: If you scroll down to the bottom, so it goes over the discussion of the schedule, but then it lists the full schedule further down in the June 18th minutes.

2791
03:51:31,363 --> 03:51:34,284
[SPEAKER_32]: But if it's still confusing, you can still not go on it.

2792
03:51:35,744 --> 03:51:36,385
[SPEAKER_32]: Just to clarify.

2793
03:51:36,885 --> 03:51:39,386
[SPEAKER_58]: So you're mentioning the italicized text?

2794
03:51:39,606 --> 03:51:40,966
[SPEAKER_32]: Yep, at the bottom of page 11,

2795
03:51:43,319 --> 03:51:47,301
[SPEAKER_32]: It says the board developed the following schedule and it details the schedule.

2796
03:51:51,603 --> 03:51:53,083
[SPEAKER_40]: Are we looking at the same thing?

2797
03:51:54,124 --> 03:51:56,245
[SPEAKER_58]: So it's two paragraphs above the italics.

2798
03:51:56,685 --> 03:51:57,085
[SPEAKER_40]: Correct.

2799
03:51:57,905 --> 03:51:59,546
[SPEAKER_40]: Oh, two paragraphs, sorry.

2800
03:52:00,005 --> 03:52:02,207
[SPEAKER_58]: The board developed the following schedule except more.

2801
03:52:03,068 --> 03:52:06,410
[SPEAKER_58]: Verbal comments on the current proposal of the July 9th meeting.

2802
03:52:07,071 --> 03:52:07,451
[SPEAKER_58]: Here we are.

2803
03:52:08,072 --> 03:52:11,655
[SPEAKER_58]: Okay, except written comments on the current proposal until July 23rd.

2804
03:52:12,275 --> 03:52:15,858
[SPEAKER_58]: The board will deliberate and give direction to the consultants on August 6th.

2805
03:52:16,859 --> 03:52:23,724
[SPEAKER_58]: do one more round of public dialogue on September 3rd, and then potentially vote on September 17th or October 1st.

2806
03:52:24,404 --> 03:52:27,987
[SPEAKER_58]: And again, these dates are as best we know right now.

2807
03:52:28,427 --> 03:52:29,067
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay.

2808
03:52:29,968 --> 03:52:33,670
[SPEAKER_40]: Why don't you just italicize that so it stands out?

2809
03:52:33,691 --> 03:52:34,411
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay.

2810
03:52:34,871 --> 03:52:35,652
[SPEAKER_40]: Then I'll be happy.

2811
03:52:36,152 --> 03:52:36,472
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay.

2812
03:52:37,773 --> 03:52:39,895
[SPEAKER_57]: Do we need to submit a new version of the minutes?

2813
03:52:39,935 --> 03:52:40,735
[SPEAKER_57]: Are we able to?

2814
03:52:41,156 --> 03:52:41,776
[SPEAKER_57]: Oh no.

2815
03:52:42,156 --> 03:52:43,297
[SPEAKER_57]: Accepted as amended.

2816
03:52:43,337 --> 03:52:43,597
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay.

2817
03:52:43,637 --> 03:52:44,398
[SPEAKER_57]: Accepted as amended.

2818
03:52:44,438 --> 03:52:44,598
[SPEAKER_57]: Great.

2819
03:52:47,461 --> 03:52:49,523
[SPEAKER_58]: Any other comments on the 18th of the 25th?

2820
03:52:51,244 --> 03:52:51,664
[SPEAKER_58]: Seeing none.

2821
03:52:51,684 --> 03:53:00,090
[SPEAKER_58]: So I'm gonna ask for a motion to accept the minutes from June 18th as amended and June 25th.

2822
03:53:01,031 --> 03:53:01,631
[SPEAKER_40]: So moved.

2823
03:53:01,911 --> 03:53:02,392
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, John.

2824
03:53:02,432 --> 03:53:03,072
[SPEAKER_58]: Can I have a second?

2825
03:53:06,435 --> 03:53:06,875
[SPEAKER_40]: Second.

2826
03:53:07,175 --> 03:53:07,655
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Ben.

2827
03:53:08,416 --> 03:53:09,457
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm gonna call him as I see him.

2828
03:53:09,837 --> 03:53:10,397
[SPEAKER_58]: John Anderson?

2829
03:53:11,258 --> 03:53:11,418
[SPEAKER_40]: Aye.

2830
03:53:12,059 --> 03:53:12,599
[SPEAKER_58]: Ben LaValle?

2831
03:53:13,139 --> 03:53:13,259
Aye.

2832
03:53:13,860 --> 03:53:14,460
[SPEAKER_58]: Peter Kalbs?

2833
03:53:15,281 --> 03:53:15,341
[SPEAKER_40]: Aye.

2834
03:53:17,158 --> 03:53:17,918
[SPEAKER_58]: Sabrina Alpino.

2835
03:53:18,759 --> 03:53:18,879
[SPEAKER_63]: Aye.

2836
03:53:19,779 --> 03:53:20,640
[SPEAKER_58]: Ari Goffman-Fishman.

2837
03:53:21,880 --> 03:53:21,940
[SPEAKER_63]: Aye.

2838
03:53:22,881 --> 03:53:24,982
[SPEAKER_58]: And I myself, Emily Heatherman, am also an aye.

2839
03:53:26,382 --> 03:53:28,583
[SPEAKER_58]: The next item that we have is zoning updates.

2840
03:53:29,684 --> 03:53:30,804
[SPEAKER_58]: What's going on with zoning, guys?

2841
03:53:33,786 --> 03:53:34,066
[SPEAKER_65]: Sorry.

2842
03:53:35,386 --> 03:53:42,650
[SPEAKER_41]: The last time I was able to discuss with city council members, they indicated that they were planning to refer

2843
03:53:44,048 --> 03:53:51,822
[SPEAKER_41]: the corridor zoning out of their commit out of City Council to this board on the 15th.

2844
03:53:52,002 --> 03:53:52,884
[SPEAKER_41]: So next week.

2845
03:53:55,375 --> 03:54:03,022
[SPEAKER_41]: There, they have not even begun any discussion on parking, other than there was a public meeting to sort of hear concerns.

2846
03:54:04,063 --> 03:54:13,532
[SPEAKER_41]: Beyond that, the, the discussion that is sort of background discussion has been that we need to look at some of our details in parking around like

2847
03:54:13,992 --> 03:54:42,580
[SPEAKER_41]: to allowing tandem parking like what the some of the current rules are not clear and some of them cause trouble the way they are as opposed to the number of spots per unit and the board the City Council planning and permitting is going to get a presentation next Wednesday night on what is currently allowed and required in parking in depth like beyond just the how many units but per spots per unit.

2848
03:54:43,500 --> 03:54:57,142
[SPEAKER_41]: That's the update on zoning, and I did hear from a developer today who has a building that they are planning to file for site plan review, it is going to be as of right in the

2849
03:54:59,538 --> 03:55:02,280
[SPEAKER_41]: the MBTA zoning area around the Wellington area.

2850
03:55:03,261 --> 03:55:09,726
[SPEAKER_41]: And so I do expect that that will start to make its way through department head comments sometime in the next couple of weeks.

2851
03:55:09,826 --> 03:55:13,208
[SPEAKER_41]: And I do think it'll come to this board in August or early September.

2852
03:55:13,648 --> 03:55:16,511
[SPEAKER_41]: So I just wanted to let you know that there was a project like that coming.

2853
03:55:17,151 --> 03:55:18,992
[SPEAKER_57]: Awesome, exciting new neighbors for me.

2854
03:55:19,453 --> 03:55:19,673
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2855
03:55:23,929 --> 03:55:31,758
[SPEAKER_57]: Is there anything we can do to slow down the referral of topics to the Community Development Board from the City Council?

2856
03:55:31,958 --> 03:55:45,493
[SPEAKER_41]: Politely ask the City Councilors, although I will say that the corridors is the last piece that's developed and that sort of fits in with, like it's those missing pieces in between the residential and the squares.

2857
03:55:45,973 --> 03:56:10,227
[SPEAKER_41]: the wellington area that is not come the part that area that's like stop and shop and wagmans and that that's our industrial area and there has been no work done yet on that so we don't and we are doing a wellington transformation study we've hired consultants to do an in-depth study of that area so we think they'll have results next spring

2858
03:56:11,067 --> 03:56:15,730
[SPEAKER_41]: And that would produce recommendations next spring for the board to look at.

2859
03:56:16,251 --> 03:56:17,391
[SPEAKER_41]: Great.

2860
03:56:18,252 --> 03:56:19,893
[SPEAKER_58]: Next spring looks a little clearer for us.

2861
03:56:20,674 --> 03:56:21,034
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2862
03:56:21,694 --> 03:56:22,195
[SPEAKER_58]: Potentially.

2863
03:56:22,935 --> 03:56:23,335
[SPEAKER_58]: Potentially.

2864
03:56:23,536 --> 03:56:23,756
[SPEAKER_59]: Yes.

2865
03:56:25,137 --> 03:56:25,417
[SPEAKER_58]: All right.

2866
03:56:25,457 --> 03:56:28,539
[SPEAKER_58]: So at this point, I'm looking for a motion to adjourn.

2867
03:56:30,200 --> 03:56:30,720
[SPEAKER_58]: Don't all jump.

2868
03:56:31,081 --> 03:56:31,741
[SPEAKER_40]: So moved.

2869
03:56:31,981 --> 03:56:32,642
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, John.

2870
03:56:32,762 --> 03:56:33,482
[SPEAKER_58]: Looking for a second.

2871
03:56:34,643 --> 03:56:35,043
[SPEAKER_40]: Second.

2872
03:56:35,324 --> 03:56:35,844
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you, Ben.

2873
03:56:36,624 --> 03:56:37,765
[SPEAKER_58]: I'm going to call him as I see him.

2874
03:56:38,266 --> 03:56:38,886
[SPEAKER_58]: John Anderson.

2875
03:56:40,087 --> 03:56:40,167
[SPEAKER_48]: Aye.

2876
03:56:40,650 --> 03:56:41,190

[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_58]: Sabrina Alpino.

2881
03:56:47,213 --> 03:56:47,333
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_63]: Aye.

2884
03:56:51,514 --> 03:56:54,096
[SPEAKER_58]: And I, myself, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye for adjournment.

2885
03:56:54,896 --> 03:56:59,798
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you so much to members of the public who are still tuned in on Zoom or are here in the chambers.

2886
03:56:59,958 --> 03:57:00,678
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you so much.

2887
03:57:02,719 --> 03:57:04,040
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you to city staff.

03:57:04,200 --> 03:57:05,560
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you to my fellow board members.

2891
03:57:12,723 --> 03:57:13,250
[SPEAKER_64]: Recordings
