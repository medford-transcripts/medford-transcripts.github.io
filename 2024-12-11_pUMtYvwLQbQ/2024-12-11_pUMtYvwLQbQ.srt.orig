1
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:16,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Test 1-2

2
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:38,476
[SPEAKER_11]: this is a meeting of the Medford City Council Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

3
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:42,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we are meeting tonight.

4
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:46,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, December 11th 2024.

5
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:57,761
[SPEAKER_11]: To discuss the some edits to the, um C Cops ordinance.

6
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:00,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, clerk, can you please call the role?

7
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:01,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

8
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:02,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Callahan.

9
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:07,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Sang.

10
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:08,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

11
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,969
[SPEAKER_09]: And Chair Lazaro.

12
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:11,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Present.

13
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Five present, none absent.

14
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,831
[SPEAKER_11]: The meeting is called to order.

15
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:19,313
[SPEAKER_11]: I will hand it over to Vice President Collins.

16
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:22,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

17
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:27,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

18
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Chair Lozaro.

19
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:34,853
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm the sponsor of these technical amendments to the CCOPS ordinance.

20
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I would just start with a little bit of a background.

21
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:38,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Can folks hear me?

22
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:39,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

23
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:45,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Just thought I would start with a little bit of a background on the CCOPS ordinance because this was passed in the previous term.

24
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:49,921
[SPEAKER_10]: when some members of the Council were not yet part of the Council.

25
00:08:50,342 --> 00:09:00,550
[SPEAKER_10]: So just as a super quick background, this is an ordinance that the City Council worked on between 2022 and 2023.

26
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:07,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was being workshopped by constituents for a long time before that, but that's when it was on the Council's plate and being worked on in committee.

27
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:15,283
[SPEAKER_10]: We collaborated with residents, the public health and community safety committee at that time, city staff, the chief of police to create it.

28
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:19,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And it passed about a year and a half ago, maybe a little bit more now in 2023.

29
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,989
[SPEAKER_10]: So this ordinance stands for community control over public surveillance.

30
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:36,399
[SPEAKER_10]: In a nutshell, this is a way that provides for local communities to have oversight over what surveillance technologies and data may be used by different branches of their municipal government.

31
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,883
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a structure that is not unique to Medford.

32
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:53,536
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been passed in a lot of other communities and including other communities in Massachusetts that empower communities through the city council to ask to have an opportunity to ask the questions.

33
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:57,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do we want to use the surveillance technology in our city?

34
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:58,739
[SPEAKER_10]: To what ends?

35
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:00,479
[SPEAKER_10]: What are the proposed benefits?

36
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,500
[SPEAKER_10]: What problem is this supposed to solve?

37
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Will it cost us how much?

38
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:06,462
[SPEAKER_10]: What are the possible negative effects?

39
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,843
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be able to ask those questions and have those conversations and weigh those pros and cons.

40
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,325
[SPEAKER_10]: in public transparently.

41
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:26,136
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think this was a really big win for the community when we passed this last year, because that was the city being proactive and responding to residents who said, hey, we have a privacy and civil liberties concern around these surveillance technologies proliferating.

42
00:10:26,156 --> 00:10:28,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, proliferating.

43
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:30,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn, I gotta stop talking.

44
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:46,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Responding to this very real perceived danger, because we know the effects that surveillance technologies have, we know the dangers that they pose, we know the dangers that they really have posed in other communities around the U.S.

45
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:55,067
[SPEAKER_10]: and around the world, and to proactively say, before these take root in our community, let's set up a public, transparent process for us to have that conversation.

46
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:56,248
[SPEAKER_10]: in public.

47
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:57,729
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the CCOPS ordinance.

48
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,191
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been on the books for about a year and a half.

49
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:05,675
[SPEAKER_10]: And at this point, some community advocates have come forward with ideas for how to strengthen the ordinance.

50
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:09,278
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also just want to say that it's not unusual for us to do this.

51
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:14,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not unusual for us to go back to an ordinance that either maybe was passed a long time ago or that was a recently

52
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:23,571
[SPEAKER_10]: added or updated and say now that this has been in play for a little bit, that implementation has shown us some cracks that we can go back and fill.

53
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:24,612
[SPEAKER_10]: We did this recently.

54
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:30,098
[SPEAKER_10]: The zoning recodification that was done before I was a part of the council two terms ago.

55
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:46,188
[SPEAKER_10]: when those zoning tweaks were put into effect, that gave the planning staff the opportunity to say, now that we've put this into practice, now that we're working with this, we've actually noticed a couple of things that we missed, that were misstated, that we should just go back and fix so that this works the way that we mean it to.

56
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:55,755
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is just part of our legislative process as I see it to say, now that we've got the wheels on this thing, we can see it in motion, we can see what we wanna tweak so that it actually operates the way that we always intended it to.

57
00:11:58,058 --> 00:12:05,363
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I may go on, that brings us to the two suggestions from the community on how to tighten this up.

58
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:18,413
[SPEAKER_10]: And I am happy to just go through and walk us through those two technical amendments unless other councilors want to cut in first with questions or comments or anything else.

59
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:34,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins, would you like to share the portion of the proposed amendments on Zoom or on the screen so that we can?

60
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:35,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, absolutely.

61
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:36,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Hang on one sec.

62
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:44,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just get my windows in order.

63
00:12:58,148 --> 00:12:58,448
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

64
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:00,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that seems to be working.

65
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:08,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanna note if folks are looking for the full ordinance, the ordinance that was passed in 2023, that is on Muny Code.

66
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:12,738
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in the municipal documents section, not in the code of ordinances.

67
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:18,042
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because we just have a bit of a backlog with getting past ordinances uploaded into Muny Code.

68
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:19,723
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's up there, it's under municipal documents.

69
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:29,803
[SPEAKER_11]: It is also on the website under today's, on today's agenda as part of our packet for tonight, the full ordinance.

70
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:31,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

71
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:32,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

72
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:33,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

73
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:38,514
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just going to quickly walk us through the two proposed changes to the ordinance.

74
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:50,785
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first one, this would be in addition to section 5079, and that's the section that goes over enforcement, remedies, penalties, and whistleblower protections.

75
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:54,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, let me just quickly scroll up to that section so that we can kind of

76
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:57,193
[SPEAKER_10]: ground ourselves in context, not going to read the whole thing.

77
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:01,318
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is the set, this is the ordinance that's currently on the books.

78
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,422
[SPEAKER_10]: So this essentially says who enforces this ordinance.

79
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:10,088
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor's office or the mayor's designee edges the case with all of ordinances, essentially.

80
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,772
[SPEAKER_10]: If violations occur.

81
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:22,693
[SPEAKER_10]: What then, if violations are reported, what then protections for whistleblowers so that people are empowered to speak up if they think the ordinance is being violated?

82
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:29,399
[SPEAKER_10]: And nothing in this ordinance shall be conscrued to limit or affect any individual's rights under state or federal laws.

83
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,981
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the section currently.

84
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:49,430
[SPEAKER_10]: The proposed addition reads any video footage or other data recorded or obtained illegally or in violation of this ordinance shall be immediately destroyed and not introduced as evidence in any criminal or civil proceeding, except in those proceedings related to violations of this ordinance.

85
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:56,908
[SPEAKER_10]: So just to explain that, this proposed tweak is to essentially fix an oversight.

86
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:07,934
[SPEAKER_10]: The original ordinance in its many sections states how surveillance data may and may not be used, but the penalties are for not adhering to use of surveillance technology or data throughout the ordinance.

87
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:16,499
[SPEAKER_10]: But what it is silent on is what should happen to surveillance data that is obtained outside the bounds of the ordinance.

88
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:25,625
[SPEAKER_10]: So this tweak is to say, you know, any surveillance data that is gathered in a way that does not conform to the regulations put forth in the ordinance.

89
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:31,468
[SPEAKER_10]: If we didn't, for example, if we didn't approve a surveillance technology, that technology went into use anyway.

90
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:34,470
[SPEAKER_10]: It was used to protect, it was used to collect people's private data.

91
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we realized that we're like, oh, sorry, that should never have been in use.

92
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:40,493
[SPEAKER_10]: We never got permission to use that.

93
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:42,014
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens to that data?

94
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:45,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it shouldn't be kept around because that could compromise people's privacy.

95
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:46,697
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be deleted.

96
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:47,378
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be destroyed.

97
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:59,493
[SPEAKER_10]: This is kind of, to me, I'm not a lawyer, but this sounds to me like a similar concept to how if an agency were ever to obtain evidence without a warrant, that evidence can't be used because it was obtained illegally.

98
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:06,686
[SPEAKER_10]: We did pass these proposed amendments to legal prior to this meeting.

99
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:14,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Legal counsel brought up that some municipal data must be maintained according to public records law.

100
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:25,090
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe the public records law would supersede this ordinance in any case, but I do have a little bit of extra language to propose just to make that point really clear.

101
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,131
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll pause there.

102
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:31,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Callahan.

103
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:34,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

104
00:16:35,222 --> 00:16:38,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, clearly this is going to be part of the ordinance.

105
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:50,291
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure that the language is pretty clear based on it being in the ordinance, but it does like on first reading external from the ordinance.

106
00:16:51,332 --> 00:17:02,957
[SPEAKER_12]: there is this question of like, could it be used to say that residents who have their own video footage cannot use it in a criminal investigation for criminal proceeding?

107
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:16,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it's like, that would be a question for a lawyer as to whether to specifically say any video footage or other data recorded or obtained by the city, by a city entity, right?

108
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:18,925
[SPEAKER_12]: By a municipal entity, illegally or in violation.

109
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:28,925
[SPEAKER_12]: like just adding in to be very clear that we're only talking about video footage or other data obtained by the city.

110
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:37,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm getting used to the mic system still.

111
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins.

112
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:41,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

113
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for, yeah, thank you for that point.

114
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:47,315
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that I'm glad you brought that up.

115
00:17:47,335 --> 00:17:48,136
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that we

116
00:17:49,648 --> 00:18:00,435
[SPEAKER_10]: that like understandably was raised when we were going over the ordinance the first time around, because of the you know there's there's ring and nest cameras you know everywhere everywhere everywhere you look people have that kind of technology now.

117
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:05,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we can certainly look at making that clear.

118
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:14,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I think elsewhere in the ordinance, we took pains to make it clear that we're talking just about surveillance technology that's used by the city, surveillance data collected by the city.

119
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,496
[SPEAKER_10]: And explicitly, this is not about surveillance technology that people might be using.

120
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:22,978
[SPEAKER_10]: to surveil their own private property on their own private property.

121
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:24,859
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's been made pretty clear.

122
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:36,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't wanna, my only hesitation is if we start adding clarifications in specific sections, I don't want people to then say, oh, so this doesn't affect my nest camera, but what about this other part?

123
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:42,548
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be my only concern with adding language somewhere in addition to what's kind of at the top of the ordinance.

124
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:57,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Similarly, I would assume the whole ordinance would have been run by Council prior to passage previously and

125
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:25,315
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess this is a question for Vice President Collins as well, that when that came up, that probably was addressed, or is the assumption that ordinances written by City Council are only applicable to matters that are addressed by our police department, our, you know, city services, our, you know, municipal, only in the realm of municipal services?

126
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:32,691
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, in thinking about this, you think about like our tree ordinance, which does have something to do with private property, to some degree.

127
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:41,120
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I guess, like, how explicit are we trying to be?

128
00:19:42,611 --> 00:19:45,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that's a good question.

129
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:56,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel pretty comfortable that the ordinance throughout is, in the language, very targeted at municipal use of surveillance technology and surveillance data.

130
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:12,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing a, as you can see, because I'm still screen sharing, I'm kind of scrolling through the sections, and I feel pretty comfortable with how the language, you know, it's talking about municipal use,

131
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:32,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so for myself, I don't feel the need to add a disclaimers at this time, but I think it's, um, I'll pass it back to Councilor Callahan.

132
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:34,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Councillor Kelly.

133
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:36,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, just a super quick follow up.

134
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:44,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this previously part of the language that was sent to the legal before?

135
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:48,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Has this language passed through legal at least once, the stuff we're adding?

136
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:49,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

137
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:56,841
[SPEAKER_10]: This proposed addition, yeah, all the stuff that we're going to talk about tonight has been reviewed, was reviewed by legal this past week.

138
00:20:56,941 --> 00:20:57,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

139
00:20:57,722 --> 00:21:02,064
[SPEAKER_10]: And they had a couple of small amendments that I'll mention as well and can put on the screen.

140
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:03,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that makes me feel more comfortable.

141
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:04,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

142
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:04,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

143
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:04,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

144
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:05,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

145
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:21,119
[SPEAKER_10]: So just while we're on this, while we're on this section, this proposed addition, the comment from legal counsel on this section specifically, which just came in earlier today,

146
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:36,455
[SPEAKER_10]: was, again, just to many of the comments that we received when we were working on the initial ordinance was to say, we want to make really sure that this comports with state and federal law, to which, to be totally candid, my response is usually, of course it does.

147
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:40,957
[SPEAKER_10]: State and federal law supersedes city ordinances by definition.

148
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:52,323
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also don't think that it changes the intent or impact of the city ordinance to add some of the language or version of the language that was proposed, which would be to add

149
00:21:54,204 --> 00:22:19,963
[SPEAKER_10]: to the extent permitted by law, including but not limited to the requirements of the Massachusetts public records law, the municipal records retention schedule, et cetera, any video footage or other data recorded or obtained illegally or in violation of this ordinance shall be immediately destroyed and not introduced as evidence in any criminal or civil proceeding except in those proceedings related to violations of this ordinance.

150
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:28,268
[SPEAKER_10]: because that's essentially stating what should go without saying, but doesn't because we don't all have GDs.

151
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:38,674
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be one addition that I would propose for this, in addition to the addition.

152
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:42,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Collins, can you repeat that one more time?

153
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:50,621
[SPEAKER_11]: So the clerk has, this is an amendment to the language of the first proposed addition,

154
00:22:51,553 --> 00:23:01,217
[SPEAKER_11]: her legal counsel, and what was that?

155
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:01,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you say it one more time?

156
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:04,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see if I can.

157
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:05,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe an email.

158
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll repeat it, and I'll also email it to the clerk.

159
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:08,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

160
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:15,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, I can't copy over from a Word document.

161
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:18,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I will email it to the clerk.

162
00:23:20,385 --> 00:23:37,081
[SPEAKER_10]: The change would be proceeding the language that's on the screen, it would say to the extent permitted by law, including but not limited to the requirements of the Massachusetts public records law and the municipal records retention schedule.

163
00:23:38,622 --> 00:23:41,245
[SPEAKER_10]: And then proceed with that paragraph.

164
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

165
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, that covers the first section.

166
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:53,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any other comments from counselors?

167
00:23:54,253 --> 00:23:58,194
[SPEAKER_11]: About the proposed addition to Section 50 79.

168
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:00,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Enforcement remedies.

169
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:01,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Penalties whistleblower protections.

170
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Um And

171
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:11,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should talk about the second section before we talk before we hear from the public.

172
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:18,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yeah, uh, proposed amendments section 50 80 certain public private transactions.

173
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:22,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Prohibited Great.

174
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,152
[SPEAKER_10]: So this change again.

175
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:27,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me scroll up here just so we can

176
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:30,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the original.

177
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:34,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Section 5080, well, I mean, it's what we're looking at.

178
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,271
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the entirety of Section 5080 currently.

179
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:42,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Current title is certain public-private contracts prohibited.

180
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:44,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Just one paragraph.

181
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,823
[SPEAKER_10]: So my proposed change would be to keep the first section.

182
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:59,661
[SPEAKER_10]: It shall be unlawful for the city to enter into any contract for monetary value or engage in any financial transaction with a commercial entity that provides the city with the mass acquisition of privately generated and owned bulk surveillance data.

183
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:08,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Any contracts or agreements signed prior to the enactment of this ordinance that violate the section shall not be renewed after the completion of the term of said contracts or agreements.

184
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:22,269
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we would strike the following existing line from the ordinance, which reads section 5080 shall not apply to any contract or agreement executed for law enforcement operations or purposes, then we would add the language.

185
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:35,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Further, it shall be unlawful for the city to acquire or enter into an agreement to acquire or exchange bulk surveillance data that the city is banned from generating on its own with any other government entity or policing agency.

186
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:43,168
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be also to replace the word contracts in the section title with the word transactions, which is broader.

187
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:48,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so the proposed change here is to remove that exception.

188
00:25:49,173 --> 00:26:05,951
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, throughout the rest of the ordinance, we say if you're going to use surveillance tech, if you're going to use or procure or sell or do anything with surveillance data, it has to go through this public transparent process where we talk about it before the city council decides this is worth it or this is not worth the potential harms.

189
00:26:07,111 --> 00:26:17,817
[SPEAKER_10]: With this one exception for a carve out for procuring bulk surveillance data where it's commercially available for the purposes of law enforcement.

190
00:26:17,857 --> 00:26:22,239
[SPEAKER_10]: So this tweak is just to remove that one exception and make it coherent with the rest of the ordinance.

191
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:41,951
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that I didn't say at the top of this meeting, but it's something that we talked about a lot when we were going through the initial stages of the ordinance, that this policy does not, this policy is about surveillance tech and surveillance data, but it doesn't outright ban or enable any one use or technology.

192
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:43,372
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't single anything out.

193
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:46,414
[SPEAKER_10]: It just puts forward this public process that should govern all of it.

194
00:26:47,054 --> 00:26:50,176
[SPEAKER_10]: So removing this exemption would just bring that in line with the rest of the ordinance.

195
00:26:52,017 --> 00:27:02,663
[SPEAKER_10]: I also think that kind of bringing this section into the fold and into consistency with the rest of the ordinance is especially topical right now.

196
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,425
[SPEAKER_10]: State and federal courts have not

197
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:14,110
[SPEAKER_10]: yet landed on the constitutionality for any government agency to purchase surveillance data that was gathered commercially or privately.

198
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:33,002
[SPEAKER_10]: So in lieu of a ruling on this, in lieu of a precedent on this, communities like Medford have the chance to be proactive and make sure that upper levels of government, any government agency can access their constituents' private personal data without a warrant.

199
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:39,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and I think that this is especially topical right now, because there are a lot of changes at the federal level.

200
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:53,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's always a good time to make sure in this, like increasingly increasingly surveilled and digital world that we're doing the best that we can to keep pace with regulations and protections with the incredibly fast pace of technology development.

201
00:27:53,996 --> 00:27:57,118
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a way for us to be proactive and say we're not going to wait.

202
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:02,662
[SPEAKER_10]: For these slow moving like upper bureaucracies and upper jurisdictions to weigh in on

203
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:10,770
[SPEAKER_10]: If our community members' public and private data should be able to be bought and sold and used, we're just going to say, you need a warrant.

204
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,553
[SPEAKER_10]: No exceptions, no carve-outs, you need a warrant.

205
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:21,561
[SPEAKER_10]: So in a nutshell, there's more to, you know, obviously all this stuff is very nuanced, but in a nutshell, that is the intent behind removing this exemption.

206
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:27,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

207
00:28:28,183 --> 00:28:35,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other councilor comments on this point?

208
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:36,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Sang.

209
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:37,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

210
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:42,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, since I'm on Zoom, I wanted to gather my comments.

211
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:54,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna thank Councilor Collins for these edits and to thank the lawyers and the advocates that she's been liaising with, reaching out to.

212
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:57,287
[SPEAKER_05]: for these amendments as well.

213
00:28:57,588 --> 00:28:58,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're entirely logical.

214
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:11,735
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at the intent of this ordinance, what we're trying to do, what we tried to do as a city council, the edits that are in front of us today make complete sense and are coherent with

215
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:15,039
[SPEAKER_05]: with those purposes, with that intent.

216
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:24,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not over overreaching, they're very in line with what you'd expect across municipalities from an ordinance like this.

217
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:37,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't only clarify, but it also strengthens those purposes of protecting our civil liberties, of making sure that we're regulating surveillance in the city as well.

218
00:29:37,705 --> 00:29:43,949
[SPEAKER_05]: And it clears up any internal debates, inconsistencies that might've been there before.

219
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:52,615
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Councillor Collins noted, some of this is stuff that we talked about when we drafted it first, we gave it some time leaning on more

220
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:59,184
[SPEAKER_05]: on the more conservative side of things, and I think in review over the last

221
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:09,172
[SPEAKER_05]: year and a bit, I believe, of when this ordinance has been in effect, these changes make a lot of sense.

222
00:30:09,632 --> 00:30:11,953
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited to support them.

223
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:17,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear the questions from my council colleagues.

224
00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:24,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that between the suggestions from legal and just how

225
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:33,627
[SPEAKER_05]: how the rest of the ordinance is written and how it works in Massachusetts state law, I don't think we have to worry that much about those concerns.

226
00:30:34,648 --> 00:30:34,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

227
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

228
00:30:40,992 --> 00:30:42,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any other comments from Councilors?

229
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:45,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins.

230
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:48,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Chair Lozero.

231
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:55,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I also just wanted to note another, there were a couple minor points that came back from legal on this proposed change as well.

232
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:08,043
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them was, again, I think what I characterize as kind of like a, you know, it's dot RIs cross RTs kind of suggestion that noted that the limitations set forward in this section.

233
00:31:09,925 --> 00:31:14,208
[SPEAKER_10]: should not apply to surveillance data that's already exempted from the ordinance.

234
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I see the intent behind that language.

235
00:31:18,612 --> 00:31:20,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I do kind of think that goes without saying.

236
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:29,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I, you know, kind of personal preference, I sometimes think that stating things too many times in too many sections can actually reduce clarity instead of making things more clear.

237
00:31:30,183 --> 00:31:34,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm comfortable with where we have the exemption stated so far in the ordinance.

238
00:31:34,487 --> 00:31:36,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that that language is necessary.

239
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:49,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to make that more clear, there was a suggestion to say this section does not need to apply to surveillance data that was exempted from the provisions of this ordinance as set forth in section 5071.

240
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:54,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Section 5071 says this ordinance does not apply to these technologies.

241
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:59,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think, I feel like if I were to read this ordinance, I would assume that that was true in all sections.

242
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:02,932
[SPEAKER_10]: So I always appreciate a legal counsel's thoroughness.

243
00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:10,337
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not myself proposing that as an amendment just because I do think it's unnecessary, but I just wanted to state that for transparency.

244
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:14,940
[SPEAKER_10]: However, they did note that the term bulk surveillance data is not defined.

245
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that could be worthwhile.

246
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:36,268
[SPEAKER_10]: So after we hear from all questions and counselors, I'm sorry, from all questions and comments, I'll make a couple of motions and included in that, I would ask KP Law to provide a suggestion for a definition of bulk surveillance data that we could add to the first section of the ordinance just to keep everything super clear.

247
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Leming.

248
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President.

249
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Collins and everybody for all your work on this.

250
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:53,752
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been thinking for most of this meeting about the exact definition of bulk surveillance data.

251
00:32:53,772 --> 00:33:07,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also ask that KP law in considering a definition of bulk surveillance data also include a provision to

252
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:17,278
[SPEAKER_08]: include data that is synthetically generated to be similar to bulk surveillance data.

253
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:30,069
[SPEAKER_08]: So in my day job, I'm actually a machine learning researcher and that is one loophole that could potentially be used to get around the acquisition of

254
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:41,958
[SPEAKER_08]: that sort of bulk data is you could actually train models that could generate data that's similar to bulk data without actually handing the data itself over to another entity.

255
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:48,921
[SPEAKER_08]: So in coming up with that definition, I would just ask that KP Law consider that.

256
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:52,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd also be willing to talk to them myself about that.

257
00:33:55,991 --> 00:34:04,734
[SPEAKER_08]: This actually is like an issue that legislatures are running into when they're trying to come up with the appropriate definitions for this technology.

258
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:07,095
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

259
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:11,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

260
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:21,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a very valid point and something that we should consider including.

261
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any other any further comments from counselors?

262
00:34:30,143 --> 00:34:32,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Shall we move to public comment?

263
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:37,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, do we have any public comment in the chambers?

264
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:39,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Please, if you'd like, you can line up at the podium.

265
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:51,555
[SPEAKER_11]: And anybody on Zoom, you can raise your hand if you'd like to make a comment and I will alternate back and forth.

266
00:34:54,044 --> 00:34:55,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

267
00:34:57,407 --> 00:35:03,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you touch the, there should be, yes, and I will.

268
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:06,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

269
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:20,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am a member of Medford People Power, which was the group that initially proposed the CCOPS ordinance and which is asking for the amendment to it.

270
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:30,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you, Councilor Lozano, for holding this meeting, and Vice President Collins for taking the lead on this work.

271
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:48,424
[SPEAKER_03]: The CCOPS ordinance exists because City Council and Medford residents share a concern and interest around civil liberties, public safety, privacy, transparency in government,

272
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,674
[SPEAKER_03]: and sound decision-making around major financial decisions.

273
00:35:53,754 --> 00:36:03,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It reflects a widespread public opinion that use of surveillance technology should be made public and the government should protect people's privacy.

274
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:18,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Residents in Medford spent over four years working on this to get this ordinance passed and gained the endorsement of a wide range of community organizations, institutions, and faith communities.

275
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:35,348
[SPEAKER_03]: While the passage of the ordinance in early 2023 was a great victory, a loophole remains which has been discussed regarding the city's potential purchase of commercially available surveillance data.

276
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:41,809
[SPEAKER_03]: This type of contract potentially threatens both accountability and civil liberties.

277
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,310
[SPEAKER_03]: We strongly encourage the city

278
00:36:45,305 --> 00:37:02,258
[SPEAKER_03]: of the City Council to restore the language that we originally had in Section 5080 that included the Medford Police Department along with all other city departments as prohibited from purchasing bulk surveillance data or exchanging it.

279
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:13,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And might I suggest that in looking for a definition of bulk surveillance data that you also go to the ACLU of Massachusetts and

280
00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:24,238
[SPEAKER_03]: because they are expert in this and KP Law for all its strengths is probably not on the cutting edge of this stuff.

281
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:40,706
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure our tax dollars are being spent going towards true public safety and not on expensive gadgets and software that enriches corporations more than they actually help us.

282
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:43,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again.

283
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:45,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

284
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,961
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

285
00:37:50,401 --> 00:38:00,765
[SPEAKER_11]: David Harris, please state your name and address for the record.

286
00:38:03,413 --> 00:38:06,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, David Harris, 151 Sharon Street, West Medford.

287
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:14,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you so much for this opportunity and thank you to the council for considering this.

288
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:25,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna speak briefly tonight on behalf of the language under consideration, which I think aligns the city's policies surrounding the use of technology with our shared sense of community and justice.

289
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:36,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I do so having already provided my thoughts in previous sessions, but as I noted in both sets of comments, I thought there may still be some wrinkles to iron out.

290
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:46,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that this is an example of the council really showing incredible leadership in trying to think through how to work out those wrinkles.

291
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:54,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had thought one of these wrinkles didn't exist when we first started, but I'm glad to see that it's being addressed now.

292
00:38:55,694 --> 00:39:13,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna say any more except, you know, I think as we consider ways to kind of reaffirm ourselves as a welcoming city, I think adopting this simple common sense language is kind of a concrete affirmation that we consider all residents of Medford neither commodified data points nor prey, but neighbors.

293
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:24,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I applaud the council for revisiting the ordinance and continuing to protect us from the known and unknown dangers of unfettered surveillance and data accumulation.

294
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:26,243
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for me.

295
00:39:26,304 --> 00:39:32,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do appreciate it, and thank you for the opportunity, and I encourage you to adopt this language as amended.

296
00:39:36,035 --> 00:39:36,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

297
00:39:37,396 --> 00:39:38,838
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go back to the podium.

298
00:39:38,998 --> 00:39:40,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address for the record, please.

299
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jean's daughter.

300
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:43,002
[SPEAKER_01]: 36 on her street.

301
00:39:43,783 --> 00:39:49,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank the council for considering these technical amendments and counselor Collins for putting them forth.

302
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to speak particularly to section 50 79.

303
00:39:56,355 --> 00:40:03,919
[SPEAKER_01]: That amendment, which is about data that is obtained contrary to a surveillance use policy.

304
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:13,944
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CCOPS ordinance sets up a system where if the city wants to use surveillance technology, they seek city council approval.

305
00:40:14,464 --> 00:40:20,067
[SPEAKER_01]: They say how they're going to use it through their surveillance use policy, which you would then approve.

306
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:24,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they go outside of the policy that you've approved,

307
00:40:24,582 --> 00:40:27,003
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's when this section kicks in.

308
00:40:27,944 --> 00:40:44,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, I feel like it sets up a system of transparency with residents so that we know the city's adhering to the commitments they've made in their surveillance use policy and also holds the city accountable if they don't follow the policy they said they were going to follow.

309
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:47,696
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, that's what I wanted to say.

310
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:48,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to thank you both.

311
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:51,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for considering these amendments.

312
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:53,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fully support them.

313
00:40:57,182 --> 00:40:57,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

314
00:40:58,865 --> 00:41:02,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing no more hands on Zoom, we have one more at the podium.

315
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:04,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

316
00:41:05,984 --> 00:41:06,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

317
00:41:07,105 --> 00:41:11,447
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Jennifer Yankle, and I live at 16 Monument Street in West Medford.

318
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:20,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank Councilor Collins for bringing this forward and for the work that you've all been doing on the amendments and on this ordinance.

319
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:29,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really important to realize that I'm repeating what other people have said, but I think it's important to underline that

320
00:41:30,678 --> 00:41:43,030
[SPEAKER_07]: As much as many of us may be alarmed by the rapid development of surveillance technologies, this is not precluding the use of such technologies.

321
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:48,455
[SPEAKER_07]: It's simply making sure that we as residents of the city, through our city council,

322
00:41:48,975 --> 00:41:53,137
[SPEAKER_07]: are able to know what's going on and to some extent control it.

323
00:41:54,998 --> 00:42:07,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a member of the NAACP, the Mystic Valley branch, and we have been following this CCOPS ordinance and have had people come and speak to our branch about it, and we very much support it.

324
00:42:07,884 --> 00:42:14,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of that reason is because we recognize that racism is a public health threat.

325
00:42:15,507 --> 00:42:20,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And this ordinance is a concrete thing that Medford can do to address racism.

326
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:25,416
[SPEAKER_07]: As we know, surveillance has historically been used against communities of color.

327
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,818
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been used against Muslim communities.

328
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,640
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been used against immigrants.

329
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,802
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been used against activists.

330
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:36,086
[SPEAKER_07]: The technology is vastly underregulated.

331
00:42:37,503 --> 00:42:43,067
[SPEAKER_07]: rapidly evolving and built in such a way that it's difficult for municipalities to use it fairly.

332
00:42:43,547 --> 00:42:45,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why we need this kind of regulation.

333
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:56,637
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really, on behalf of the branch, I want to thank the council for considering this and assure you of our full support.

334
00:42:57,917 --> 00:43:04,182
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a personal comment that comes from hearing the issue of bulk

335
00:43:04,992 --> 00:43:06,794
[SPEAKER_07]: data being raised.

336
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:20,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's really critical because we're not only talking about the city purchasing and using surveillance technologies, but perhaps even more importantly, the possibility of purchasing bulk data.

337
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:23,569
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much.

338
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:26,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

339
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:29,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I see one more hand on Zoom.

340
00:43:32,038 --> 00:43:37,119
[SPEAKER_11]: ask you to unmute and please state your name and address for the record.

341
00:43:37,499 --> 00:43:39,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, turn on my camera too.

342
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,500
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Ellen Epstein.

343
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I live at 15 Grove Street and I'll be brief.

344
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:54,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I just really want to thank the members of this committee and the people who've been working on this ordinance for being proactive

345
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:59,744
[SPEAKER_06]: and not waiting until an infringement occurs.

346
00:43:59,764 --> 00:44:11,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a member of Safe Medford and I can state unequivocally that we all feel that this is important, an important safety move.

347
00:44:12,508 --> 00:44:13,969
[SPEAKER_06]: for everyone in our community.

348
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:21,332
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks to the members of this committee for bringing it forward and for thinking so carefully about the wording.

349
00:44:22,413 --> 00:44:24,454
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you.

350
00:44:24,474 --> 00:44:25,794
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

351
00:44:30,456 --> 00:44:30,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

352
00:44:32,317 --> 00:44:37,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing no further public participation, are there any motions on the floor, Vice President Collins?

353
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:41,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

354
00:44:42,562 --> 00:44:48,564
[SPEAKER_10]: I would motion to incorporate the discussed amendments.

355
00:44:49,144 --> 00:45:03,290
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just emailed those to the clerk, that would be the addition to section 5079 with the new first sentence that we discussed in committee pertaining to Massachusetts public records law and municipal records and retention schedule.

356
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:20,344
[SPEAKER_10]: and in Section 5080 to change the title to say transactions instead of contracts, and to make those line item changes to Section 5080, as well as to request guidance on a definition for the term bulk surveillance data.

357
00:45:23,126 --> 00:45:31,774
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I don't want to state Councilor Lemming's motion for him, but pending that, I would also motion to incorporate those amendments and report this out of committee.

358
00:45:36,742 --> 00:45:45,505
[SPEAKER_11]: On Vice President Collins' various motions, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

359
00:45:46,446 --> 00:45:57,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Clerk, can you call the roll when you're ready?

360
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:02,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lemming, do you have a separate motion to make?

361
00:46:13,116 --> 00:46:37,297
[SPEAKER_08]: request guidance on language for... Yes, an amendment to that is to request legal guidance on the use of synthetically generated data in the definition of bulk surveillance data.

362
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:11,894
[SPEAKER_09]: To request a legal opinion on the use of bulk data?

363
00:47:12,134 --> 00:47:27,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Request legal opinion on the use of synthetically generated data in our definition of bulk surveillance data.

364
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I included that as one motion.

365
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:36,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm cool with it too.

366
00:47:36,841 --> 00:47:39,022
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a second from Councilor Callahan.

367
00:47:43,003 --> 00:47:43,543
[SPEAKER_09]: The roll call.

368
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:45,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

369
00:47:46,224 --> 00:47:47,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

370
00:47:47,785 --> 00:47:47,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

371
00:47:48,525 --> 00:47:49,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lemming.

372
00:47:49,345 --> 00:47:49,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

373
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:50,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Sang.

374
00:47:51,306 --> 00:47:51,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

375
00:47:52,446 --> 00:47:53,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair Lazaro.

376
00:47:53,527 --> 00:47:53,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

377
00:47:54,127 --> 00:47:56,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Five in the affirmative, none in the negative.

378
00:47:56,128 --> 00:47:57,108
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

379
00:48:00,129 --> 00:48:00,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

380
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any other motions on the floor?

381
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:11,063
[SPEAKER_11]: on the motion of Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lemming to adjourn.

382
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:15,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Clerk, can you call the roll, please?

383
00:48:15,987 --> 00:48:16,487
[SPEAKER_11]: When you have a chance.

384
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:25,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan?

385
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:26,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins?

386
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:27,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lemming?

387
00:48:28,177 --> 00:48:28,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

388
00:48:28,618 --> 00:48:29,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Sang?

389
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:29,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

390
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair Lozano?

391
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:31,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
