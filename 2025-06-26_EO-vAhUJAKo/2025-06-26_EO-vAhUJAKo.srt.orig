1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:00,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

2
00:00:00,731 --> 00:00:03,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody is completely new to this office.

3
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:04,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Alicia Hunt.

4
00:00:04,693 --> 00:00:07,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability for the city.

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:28,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I am here this evening with Zach Bares, President of the City Council, Kate Collins, Vice President of the City Council, our consultant, Paola Ramos Martinez, and my brain is not going to manage to say Jimmy's name, the black name off the top of his head,

6
00:00:28,927 --> 00:00:41,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy Rocha from Innis is a consultant, and Emily Innis is remote this evening, managing the senior planner Danielle Evans with us this evening.

7
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:49,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plan, as we've done it with other Q&As, is that the consultants are going to give a presentation.

8
00:00:50,692 --> 00:01:04,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what we're looking at what what the proposal is at this time, and we will open it up for Q and a, in this room, it's pretty hard to have conversations over there.

9
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,200
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how that goes.

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Answer or visual questions.

11
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:10,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, you're breaking up a little bit.

12
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,241
[SPEAKER_03]: You can point it out.

13
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:25,645
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be very specific about stuff over there.

14
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:54,680
[SPEAKER_02]: When we do the general Q&A, it's really helpful, particularly for the people in the room, if your questions are about the big picture or your comments in the general.

15
00:01:55,021 --> 00:02:01,705
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to know exactly what's going on at your house location, that would be an individual conversation that you can have over there.

16
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:04,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point, Jimmy could go over there, too, to help you find.

17
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy's our mapping expert.

18
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:08,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, that's his job.

19
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:19,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can look at very specific questions and very specific parcels over there on the map, and then we can catch those in writing for the consultants.

20
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:23,344
[SPEAKER_24]: Are we ready for the presentation?

21
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:24,685
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you want to say anything?

22
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:26,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people are using Wi-Fi.

23
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:28,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they can turn it on.

24
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:31,870
[SPEAKER_24]: We're having some trouble with Wi-Fi.

25
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,413
[SPEAKER_24]: Internet service.

26
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,014
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all on the guest Wi-Fi.

27
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:42,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

28
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:54,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to say to the people on Zoom, if you're having trouble with anything, please message Emily because she is remote and it's easier for her to see that that message came in.

29
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:59,058
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome to try and message me, but I may not notice it and I apologize.

30
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:03,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everyone.

31
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:06,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Is everyone hearing me fine?

32
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:10,640
[SPEAKER_10]: There is an echo when you speak, Paola.

33
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,360
[SPEAKER_10]: The sound has been going in and out.

34
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:18,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it now better?

35
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:19,642
[SPEAKER_10]: That is better.

36
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:23,103
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

37
00:03:23,883 --> 00:03:26,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Interrupt me whenever you want.

38
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:27,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Just let me know.

39
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:31,715
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will start now with the presentation.

40
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:40,879
[SPEAKER_05]: So our agenda, we will do a little bit of the introduction, some of the process timeline.

41
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:43,180
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are we doing?

42
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,442
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the topics that we are going to talk about?

43
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:49,183
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the future topics that we will talk about?

44
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:53,686
[SPEAKER_05]: When are those opportunities for the public comments?

45
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:55,807
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not late.

46
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,628
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have a lot of different

47
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,084
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, meetings and different types of meetings, uh, where we can talk and continue to read public comments.

48
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:12,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then we will go to the topic of tonight, which is the square, Medford square and the 80s.

49
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:25,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I know that a lot of the people that are using things already know just for the new people, the people that are joining for the first time.

50
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I just want to talk a little bit of it.

51
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:29,233
[SPEAKER_05]: what are we doing.

52
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:36,134
[SPEAKER_05]: We are taking a look into the zoning, the current zoning of Manifold.

53
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:44,996
[SPEAKER_05]: We are bringing from the comprehensive plan that was signed and released in January 2023.

54
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:51,977
[SPEAKER_05]: We are also looking at climate action and adaptation plan in 2022.

55
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:56,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are bringing all the principles and all of the

56
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:12,278
[SPEAKER_05]: all of the things and topics that were identified and problems that the zoning had, and we are bringing it in and looking at how can we comply with those principles that were identified in these plans.

57
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,621
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a vision map.

58
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:17,243
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the one you see right now.

59
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:22,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And here they divided the city in different areas.

60
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:29,450
[SPEAKER_05]: So the corridors, the squares, the special districts, institutional, and the residential districts.

61
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how we are approaching this process.

62
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are going in with corridors.

63
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:42,375
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a City Avenue and Salem Street corridors, and those are already improved.

64
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:46,577
[SPEAKER_05]: We are looking at the residential districts,

65
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we are now at the city board.

66
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:55,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then today we're looking at the squares.

67
00:05:55,966 --> 00:06:00,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to look at the rest of the quarters and the description of the street.

68
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:03,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And well, it will be, um.

69
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,876
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's this process?

70
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:15,198
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we do this process until we have an improved district or a new change in the zoning?

71
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,679
[SPEAKER_05]: We do it in four steps.

72
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:21,380
[SPEAKER_05]: We first present to the city council a new topic.

73
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,441
[SPEAKER_05]: We get comments from the public.

74
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:26,582
[SPEAKER_05]: We present it at least a second time.

75
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:31,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it gets referred from the city council to the city board.

76
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:51,339
[SPEAKER_05]: We go to the city board, we present the city recommendations with our own recommendations and public comments, and when they feel that they are prepared, they vote it, and they refer it back to the city council.

77
00:06:51,979 --> 00:07:00,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this topic in the city council, we see the public opinion, and then it gets voted, and then it's approved.

78
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:05,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a lot of steps before it gets approved.

79
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:19,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now in the planning and permitting committee meeting is that first step we present the topics and the city council gets prepared to vote and to refer to the city, to the city board.

80
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:24,334
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now we are in the commercial.

81
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:27,815
[SPEAKER_05]: We did the, we presented the squares.

82
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:29,715
[SPEAKER_05]: The squares are referred to the city board.

83
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:34,529
[SPEAKER_05]: and we are, so they were presented to the city board.

84
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:48,772
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a yesterday presentation to the city board about residential districts, in a different process, a little bit of parallel, because a lot of times we have to go a little bit back and forth.

85
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:52,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have public meetings.

86
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:58,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now we have, well, we don't see it, but today we're doing the squares.

87
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:06,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Later on, May 29th, we'll see the other corridors, and then the 9th, parking and TDM.

88
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:07,834
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the ones that are planned.

89
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:13,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, some of the topics, and just to skip this one, so that we can have it.

90
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:13,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

91
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:26,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we try one thing?

92
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:32,368
[SPEAKER_02]: If you try without this mic and see if you can project and the people in the room can hear you sufficiently.

93
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,009
[SPEAKER_02]: If that works better?

94
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because it's really echoey for the Zoom.

95
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:36,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

96
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:39,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Emily, like this, do you hear me better?

97
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:41,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Much, much better.

98
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:44,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

99
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:45,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you hear me?

100
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:49,876
[SPEAKER_05]: If you come closer, that will help me a lot.

101
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:51,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

102
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:54,233
[SPEAKER_05]: If you hear me, you're fine.

103
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:58,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I will try to project if I get down, just shout and let me know.

104
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:10,465
[SPEAKER_05]: So this, for example, is the latest proposal that we gave to the Community Development Board yesterday about the residential districts.

105
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:15,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to show it because it always has to do with what we are doing now.

106
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:25,242
[SPEAKER_05]: This map is with the proposal for the squares, the commercial framework in the other corridors.

107
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:33,965
[SPEAKER_05]: We have approved Salem Street and Mystic.

108
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:41,208
[SPEAKER_05]: We are still working on the other corridors, the institutional Medford Tufts and Wellington.

109
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:46,170
[SPEAKER_05]: So you here see more or less how the map is coming together.

110
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:54,518
[SPEAKER_05]: The non-residential districts, these are all the non-residential districts.

111
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:00,505
[SPEAKER_05]: They can have mixed use, commercial, and some are going to be

112
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,989
[SPEAKER_05]: residential, but there are mainly service and higher density areas.

113
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,396
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was the first proposal for the rest for the commercial framework.

114
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:18,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are going to see right now the Medford Square.

115
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:25,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so we're going to look into the current zoning, what it is there already.

116
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:30,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we have commercial one, and that is the pinkish area.

117
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:36,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it allows six stories by right for multifamily residential building.

118
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,229
[SPEAKER_05]: For commercial building, it allows four stories by right.

119
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And then any unpermitted structures are 15 stories by right.

120
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:55,705
[SPEAKER_05]: The orange, the dark orange we see in apartment two also allows residential building six stories by right.

121
00:10:56,246 --> 00:11:03,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Commercial use is not allowed and hotel use is 15 stories by right.

122
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:14,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have a lighter orange color in this area that is general residential, that is single unit and two units dwelling.

123
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, it's also without ADU.

124
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:26,235
[SPEAKER_05]: And then single family one, this is in the higher area, single unit dwelling and ADU.

125
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,302
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the current zoning.

126
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:36,324
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not exactly what it is going on today in there, very far from what we see today.

127
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:43,506
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a little bit of the summary for those I mentioned standards.

128
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:50,087
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the first proposal that we did in March 26.

129
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:53,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we have done is

130
00:11:55,885 --> 00:12:02,070
[SPEAKER_05]: mixed use 1, mixed use 2A, mixed use 2B, and mixed use 3.

131
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,113
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the first proposal.

132
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:14,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to the latest one, and this is the one that was referred now from the City Council to the Community Development Board.

133
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, the same districts for the mixed uses.

134
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:24,366
[SPEAKER_05]: The difference was as

135
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:37,402
[SPEAKER_05]: In the map, it was to enlarge this area from 2B to 3, and that allows higher buildings right now.

136
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:41,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So it mixes one and then it will also change.

137
00:12:42,547 --> 00:12:44,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to interrupt.

138
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:45,990
[SPEAKER_10]: You're about two slides behind us.

139
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,631
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's okay.

140
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:47,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

141
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:52,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it catch up now?

142
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:59,457
[SPEAKER_10]: We can see the current or I can see the current zoning spreadsheet.

143
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:05,162
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not you, it's the internet.

144
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:05,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

145
00:13:06,263 --> 00:13:07,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

146
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:08,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I just switched.

147
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:10,187
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on your hotspot.

148
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:26,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Paolo, what might be worth it is I'm just wondering if I share my screen and just keep up with the slides.

149
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:27,880
[SPEAKER_10]: If I just keep up with you.

150
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:27,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

151
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

152
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just opening it up now.

153
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a sec everyone, we'll get this sorted.

154
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:41,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I'm trying to get my patience.

155
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm going to share.

156
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:52,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring it up.

157
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:54,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, full screen mode.

158
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:56,737
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to catch up.

159
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Last thing I saw everyone was.

160
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:09,100
[SPEAKER_10]: This was the zoning we saw that we saw this so.

161
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,322
[SPEAKER_10]: If you just don't mind repeating slightly for this 1.

162
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so this one was made to the table of the current zoning.

163
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:24,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So a little bit of what I just said.

164
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:34,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we have the first proposal that we did for the planning and permitting in March 26.

165
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:43,727
[SPEAKER_05]: We did some new analysis and some suggestions from the councillors and the public.

166
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:45,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can go to the next one

167
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily, yes, this is I just switched to April 30th.

168
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:57,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

169
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:02,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go with yours and tell me when you slide.

170
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:05,195
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'm on if you tell me when.

171
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:15,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, when you're off, when you go to side, so speak to slide 20 and just tell me when you move to slide 21, and then we'll move each of our presentations separately.

172
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:20,257
[SPEAKER_05]: This is perfect right now.

173
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:35,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we did in the changes, as I said, was on the really right and next to the 93, we extended that mixed use three.

174
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:44,493
[SPEAKER_05]: We did some section and analysis, and we saw that that was perfectly possible.

175
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:55,624
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is one of the changes, and the next changes are in the permitted heights of the districts.

176
00:15:56,365 --> 00:16:12,713
[SPEAKER_05]: So for mixed use one with density or intensity, we have four stories by right and just one story as an incentive zoning, so it can go up to five with incentive zoning.

177
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:20,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is only the area south of High Street, that very historical buildings.

178
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:21,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

179
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have mixed use 2A.

180
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:32,914
[SPEAKER_05]: This allows five stories by right plus two with incentive zoning, allowing us seven.

181
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:40,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Mixed use 2B, that is seven stories by right, plus two, that is nine with incentive zoning.

182
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:48,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Mixed use 3, eight stories by right, plus four, that's 12 with incentive zoning.

183
00:16:49,402 --> 00:17:04,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, then we have, uh, some neighborhood residential three, um, on the north part of an existing single-family, uh, currently district that is up some to NR3.

184
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:15,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have some urban residential one to transition towards the NR3, um, then from the other side to the UL2 areas.

185
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:17,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

186
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:20,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will be the map.

187
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:22,903
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the map that we have on the back.

188
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:28,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So any comments is the maps.

189
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:31,786
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go to the next one.

190
00:17:44,583 --> 00:18:00,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so the development standards we are using is how we can protect the residential districts, the residential neighborhoods with these developments.

191
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:09,915
[SPEAKER_05]: What we want to make sure is the proper height when it's abutting a residential house

192
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:18,524
[SPEAKER_05]: So, for example, the 1st thing that we do is for the residential districts, what we have is the maximum height.

193
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:33,506
[SPEAKER_05]: and then from the lot line that is in front of the mixed district, and then we go on a 45 degree angle, and that will give us that maximum height.

194
00:18:34,286 --> 00:18:41,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only that, then it needs to be respectful with the shadow, so how much daylight they are,

195
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,281
[SPEAKER_05]: they are blocking.

196
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:49,506
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't want that to happen.

197
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:54,173
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will ask in the site plan review to add a condition of daylight.

198
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:58,540
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the minimum daylight standard and we need to

199
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:02,483
[SPEAKER_05]: that's something that we want to see how that can be drafted.

200
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:05,424
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's something that we want to also include.

201
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:10,765
[SPEAKER_05]: So with this, we will protect so we have, uh, seven stories high by right.

202
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:17,347
[SPEAKER_05]: But with these things, it might not be able to go within four, and that is to protect, um, the

203
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:29,578
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, and Pella, if you all can turn off your video, I think that might be using too much bandwidth.

204
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:33,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And the sound quality has dropped a little bit.

205
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:35,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, there we go.

206
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:36,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see how that does.

207
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:37,343
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

208
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:40,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

209
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:41,826
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, go ahead.

210
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, for example, in this option

211
00:19:49,412 --> 00:20:06,100
[SPEAKER_05]: If the lots are being combined, sometimes it makes it easier to have some setback from the street and be able to have a higher, to get the building more height, but having some setback and setbacks.

212
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you share parking, a lot of more interesting things are able to happen.

213
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:16,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you go to the next one?

214
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So here is from Medford Square.

215
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,791
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not going to look into West Medford Square.

216
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:30,732
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any questions at the end, you can absolutely ask.

217
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:36,233
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see the existing zoning as well for West Medford.

218
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you go to the next one?

219
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:43,215
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be on 25.

220
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

221
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this is perfect.

222
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:53,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So, as you see, these are the same districts that we saw before.

223
00:20:53,724 --> 00:21:03,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Commercial one, allowing 6 stories by right for residential building, 4 stories by right for commercial, and 15 stories by right for any other structures.

224
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:11,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we have apartment one, that is that salmon kind of color.

225
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:16,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is three stories by right and not commercial allowed.

226
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:25,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have the least, the less than 60 neighborhoods, which is general residential and single family.

227
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:27,935
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to the next one, 26.

228
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:42,167
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see the table, I think, as well as we did in the previous one.

229
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:43,888
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can go to the next.

230
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:59,037
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be up.

231
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:02,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this is the first proposal.

232
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:09,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We can go to the next one already, so I can explain the latest one.

233
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:13,320
[SPEAKER_05]: In the presentation it is, so if anyone is interested.

234
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:28,550
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you can see, we are going to leave the highest intensity along highest street, and then along the rail tracks, along the commuter rail.

235
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is your MX mixed use 2B.

236
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:41,105
[SPEAKER_05]: that allows the same as in Medford Square, seven stories by right plus two with incentive zoning.

237
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:49,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have going towards the neighborhoods, we have the residential districts.

238
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:58,235
[SPEAKER_05]: we have the mixed use 2A, so that is five stories by right and two incentive zoning that makes it seven.

239
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:02,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Then going further, we have the urban residential.

240
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,680
[SPEAKER_05]: These are only residential uses.

241
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:16,049
[SPEAKER_05]: That is that red color that allows from three units up to, there is no limit, multifamily with no limit of units.

242
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,712
[SPEAKER_05]: And this will be three stories by right.

243
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:22,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have some.

244
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:29,080
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a previous residential proposal.

245
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,862
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the updated version on the maps.

246
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:41,102
[SPEAKER_05]: but mainly was to increase as well the intensity along the tracks from the previous proposal.

247
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:47,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had the same upgrade for each of the districts with that extra height.

248
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:52,009
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can go to the next one.

249
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:01,394
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't see it.

250
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:03,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, okay.

251
00:24:06,543 --> 00:24:07,743
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go to the next one.

252
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:16,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're going to start accessory dwelling units.

253
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:18,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

254
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:25,634
[SPEAKER_05]: The accessory dwelling unit,

255
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:38,812
[SPEAKER_05]: This comes from a document that is the Accessory Drawing Unit Guide from Boston.

256
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:45,977
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a very good book and guide, so if anyone is interested, they have a lot of examples.

257
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,698
[SPEAKER_05]: plans, etc.

258
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:51,619
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very interesting you can look at that.

259
00:24:52,119 --> 00:25:06,684
[SPEAKER_05]: The accessory dwelling unit is an accessory used to the principal use of a residential district to allow to have an extra dwelling without counting as another dwelling so that is permitted.

260
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:11,986
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be internal, it can be attached, and it can be detached.

261
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,990
[SPEAKER_05]: These you already have in your zoning.

262
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:20,214
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have accessory units are permitted.

263
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:23,396
[SPEAKER_05]: The conditions are a little bit different.

264
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:36,199
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, not, I think it was in February, there was a new law from Massachusetts, general law, and they changed a little bit of what you can permit or not.

265
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And they created this new protected use ADUs.

266
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:47,282
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we need to tweak the current zoning for the ADUs in the Medford zoning.

267
00:25:47,962 --> 00:25:50,663
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is also going along

268
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:54,385
[SPEAKER_05]: the mass general law.

269
00:25:54,485 --> 00:26:01,308
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go to the next one.

270
00:26:01,368 --> 00:26:02,789
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go to the next one.

271
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:09,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now what it's going to do is a lot of examples.

272
00:26:09,532 --> 00:26:10,753
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from this guide.

273
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:20,038
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you do if you have a lot different ways of

274
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:26,459
[SPEAKER_05]: adding a new ADU into your house.

275
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:37,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is like the small lot size, then you can go to the medium, and then we can see the large option.

276
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:44,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it's small Emily, you can go, I will just talk through it, but you can continue.

277
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:56,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So usually with this ones, they will use your half a story or in medium will be attached more easily.

278
00:26:56,928 --> 00:26:59,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the very large will be detached.

279
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:05,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So all the different ways that you can build an ADU.

280
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:08,855
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can go to the next one,

281
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:21,201
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will be adding new definitions and that is what is a protected use ADUs?

282
00:27:22,401 --> 00:27:25,063
[SPEAKER_05]: What is a single dwelling residential zoning district?

283
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:34,208
[SPEAKER_05]: That is how the law says that it is allowed the protected ADUs in a single dwelling residential zoning district.

284
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:35,309
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it mean?

285
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:42,853
[SPEAKER_05]: It means any district allowed to write or by special permit a single unit dwelling.

286
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:57,498
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have a local IDU, and that is, it's a use that is not protected, so that you can use to get more flexibility of where do you want to have them.

287
00:27:57,938 --> 00:28:11,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, if we want to add it to other areas where we do not have the single unit, so the protected use is not enforced, we can have a local IDU so that they can also use it.

288
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:16,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

289
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:17,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Next one.

290
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so from the state law, this is the, uh, the actual state law.

291
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:35,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there are some regulations that for example, meant for some of those had those regulations like owner occupancy requirements.

292
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:41,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there are some minimum parking, uh, use and acute restriction unit caps.

293
00:28:42,115 --> 00:28:44,675
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the relationship between the principal dwelling?

294
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:51,257
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it's attached or detached, right now we cannot make any difference and we cannot enforce those rules.

295
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:56,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that the current zoning has about that needs to be taken out.

296
00:28:57,921 --> 00:29:00,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have some dimensionless standards.

297
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:16,994
[SPEAKER_05]: It talks about historic districts, how we could have some design standards and dimensionless standards that are different for those areas, for existing non-conforming structures, or these special permits for multiple ADUs.

298
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to the next one.

299
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:26,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions that you have about this, you can ask any of us and your team, we will answer them.

300
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:27,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are, yeah.

301
00:29:44,346 --> 00:29:45,648
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

302
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:47,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are that we have those regulations.

303
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:55,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything that, for example, the building coverage, the open space.

304
00:29:57,481 --> 00:30:01,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we have permeable open space, anything that's required.

305
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:05,577
[SPEAKER_05]: can still be required to allow the 80 years.

306
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:07,978
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to follow the same rules.

307
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:09,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

308
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:14,640
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing are certain requirements that we cannot ask anymore for the protected areas.

309
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is, for example, the owner of QMC.

310
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:24,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So that in the principal building has to leave the owner of the building and then the 80 or the other way around.

311
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:26,004
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot ask that anymore.

312
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,885
[SPEAKER_09]: They can be to rental.

313
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:29,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

314
00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:36,185
[SPEAKER_09]: they can't hear him on Zoom, so he will want to repeat the questions.

315
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:46,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so he's asking from the public, we have a question about if any of the residential requirements apply to the ADUs.

316
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:49,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are answering that absolutely, yes.

317
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:59,742
[SPEAKER_05]: The requirements of the setbacks, the height restrictions, it is a little bit different for some of them, and we can look at that later.

318
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:08,103
[SPEAKER_05]: But your building coverage, our open space requirement, permeability, all of this are going to apply.

319
00:31:08,863 --> 00:31:18,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Parking minimums, we do have some parking minimums, depending if you are within or out of the half a mile of high frequent transit.

320
00:31:19,605 --> 00:31:22,126
[SPEAKER_09]: So all of those.

321
00:31:22,806 --> 00:31:24,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you back one slide, Emily?

322
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:26,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Go back one slide.

323
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

324
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:35,489
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have their own parking regulations.

325
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:39,130
[SPEAKER_05]: It does apply the parking regulations for the dwelling.

326
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:46,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, for one family, for single unit dwelling, you need two parking places.

327
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,493
[SPEAKER_05]: For an ADU, you won't need two.

328
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:50,273
[SPEAKER_05]: You will need one.

329
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are different for the parking.

330
00:31:58,305 --> 00:31:59,647
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a prohibited regulation.

331
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:09,775
[SPEAKER_05]: because you cannot ask them to do a minimum requirement that is higher than what they ask.

332
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:25,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So they ask for, from the state law, protected use, AD use, will have, will ask for within a half a mile of a high transit, high frequency transit, they will ask zero in places.

333
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:28,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And for outside, it's one.

334
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:35,291
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you can do is ask for that one if you are outside, but you cannot ask for two.

335
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:39,492
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you cannot ask for your own part in regulations.

336
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:42,213
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to follow the ones that the states have.

337
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:46,114
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not the whole text of law.

338
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:48,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the things that

339
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:02,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I did the bullet points for sure.

340
00:33:02,192 --> 00:33:07,236
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have the regulation.

341
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:10,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I can show it to you later if you want to see it all.

342
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:12,299
[SPEAKER_05]: But they do have some parking minimums.

343
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,142
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing is that you cannot ask for more than those minimums.

344
00:33:16,723 --> 00:33:18,244
[SPEAKER_05]: More than maximum minimums.

345
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:35,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we may have lost sound everyone.

346
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:38,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just checking in with the people in the room.

347
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:50,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, so if they are asking about the minimum parking requirement that we see in here as a prohibited regulation, so we are

348
00:33:53,430 --> 00:34:01,217
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are telling that the minimum parking regulation cannot be more restrictive than what they ask.

349
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:11,847
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the case of ADU outside of the half a mile of that high transit, then you would be asking for one.

350
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:15,611
[SPEAKER_05]: You can ask for zero, but you can ask for two.

351
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:16,852
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you can ask.

352
00:34:18,112 --> 00:34:23,896
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, we are going to continue and if you have more questions, we can do it at the end, but feel free to continue with that.

353
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:25,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you go to the next one?

354
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:26,457
[SPEAKER_05]: The local ADUs?

355
00:34:40,437 --> 00:34:46,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, this is the municipal decisions that you can do to the local ADUs.

356
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:56,661
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can allow accessory dwelling units in any district, any residential district, by right or special permit.

357
00:34:57,122 --> 00:35:01,303
[SPEAKER_05]: You can allow bigger ADUs than those with 900 square foot restriction.

358
00:35:02,763 --> 00:35:10,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Municipalities can allow additional ADUs on the same lot, but you will need a special permit for that second ADU.

359
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:24,556
[SPEAKER_05]: In short-term rentals, each municipality will establish if that is something that they would like to restrict or prohibit those short-term rentals

360
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,501
[SPEAKER_10]: The people in the room, we can no longer hear anyone speaking.

361
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:53,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we are.

362
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I just was kicked out.

363
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:57,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

364
00:35:57,904 --> 00:35:58,084
Okay.

365
00:35:58,304 --> 00:35:59,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear us now?

366
00:35:59,764 --> 00:36:00,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

367
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:03,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

368
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:21,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So now the protected ADUs, we have some dimensional standards, and that is 900 square feet or half the gross floor area of the principal dwelling, whichever is smaller, so whichever is more restricted.

369
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:39,646
[SPEAKER_05]: They have some dimensional requirements and standards, and it cannot be more restricted than whatever the dimensional standards are for principal dwelling.

370
00:36:40,804 --> 00:36:44,887
[SPEAKER_05]: for the single family residential or for accessory structure.

371
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:50,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever is more permissive from those three, that's the one you can use for the ADU.

372
00:36:50,311 --> 00:37:06,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, if my principal dwelling is a duplex, and then I have two and a half stories high, my ADU can be two stories, two and a half stories high.

373
00:37:06,703 --> 00:37:09,585
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still, wow.

374
00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:12,998
[SPEAKER_02]: but it still can't be larger than that 900 square feet.

375
00:37:13,018 --> 00:37:15,198
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crazy example, but it's legal.

376
00:37:15,218 --> 00:37:18,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes the state laws don't make as much sense as you'd like them to.

377
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:43,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they just want to do a lot of flexibility and so in that it ends up.

378
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:49,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's so, for example, you can convert an existing building.

379
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:50,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

380
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:56,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if we have the.

381
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:14,930
[SPEAKER_05]: residential districts, what is permitted in each of them, and then what type of aid would apply, and then how many maximum units would have by date.

382
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:22,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So, NR1, Neighborhood Residential 1, you have single unit dwelling and historic conversion.

383
00:38:23,073 --> 00:38:28,735
[SPEAKER_05]: We can talk about historic conversion as well, if you have that question that you have.

384
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:40,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But mainly, it would be if you have a warehouse that is historic and that means it doesn't have to be registered anywhere, it's just it has to be older than 75 years.

385
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:46,425
[SPEAKER_05]: If that is the case, then it's historic and then you can convert it into a multi-unit.

386
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:57,776
[SPEAKER_05]: you would have protected ADU, that is a check, because you do have single unit dwelling in your district as permitted by right.

387
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:04,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you could add a second ADU that will be local ADU by special permit.

388
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:18,283
[SPEAKER_05]: For an energy, we have similar, so we have single unit dwelling that gives us the right to that protected ADUs, and you will have two units and historic conversion.

389
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:33,587
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have local ADUs, this will make that, it would be possible by two units plus the ADU, that is like three units, and vice versa, you could have a fourth one.

390
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:38,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Nr3, you have some 1-3 units.

391
00:39:39,964 --> 00:39:44,650
[SPEAKER_05]: So because you have the single unit, again, you have that protected use ADU.

392
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:49,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can have a second BU by right.

393
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:54,361
[SPEAKER_05]: This BU is for any principal structure

394
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:58,254
[SPEAKER_05]: district, the protected ADU.

395
00:39:58,494 --> 00:40:11,277
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that for a single family, for a duplex, and for a three-unit, you could add that protected ADU, extra special permit ADU.

396
00:40:11,837 --> 00:40:16,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you're able to have five in total in one lot.

397
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:30,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for UR1 and UR2, and this is why, as well, we take out the single-use ones, is because we also want to control a little bit that ADU.

398
00:40:31,324 --> 00:40:37,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, in any of the permitted principle structures, you can do these two extra ADUs.

399
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:44,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have two-unit dwelling, three-unit dwelling, a multiplex that goes up to six,

400
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,231
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the other two.

401
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:50,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So this goes from two to six units.

402
00:40:52,013 --> 00:40:58,277
[SPEAKER_05]: You could add a local ADU but only to one, two units, and three units.

403
00:40:59,378 --> 00:41:05,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you could add another one to local ADU by a special permit.

404
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,163
[SPEAKER_05]: UR2 would be the same.

405
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:11,365
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go here from three and there is no limit.

406
00:41:11,665 --> 00:41:13,046
[SPEAKER_05]: This is multi-family area.

407
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:13,126
[SPEAKER_05]: So

408
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:17,786
[SPEAKER_05]: or between it, you can have an ADU.

409
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:22,290
[SPEAKER_05]: In these two neighborhoods, you are one and you are two.

410
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:30,157
[SPEAKER_05]: If it is an existing single family, you can add the ADUs to those single families.

411
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,299
[SPEAKER_05]: They are protected in those.

412
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:36,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we go to the next one?

413
00:41:36,523 --> 00:41:38,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to add one more, I think.

414
00:41:43,697 --> 00:41:52,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was to be decided, it is decided now, or at least it's been referred to the City Development Board.

415
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:56,642
[SPEAKER_05]: The second ADU will be allowed by social permit.

416
00:41:57,382 --> 00:42:02,744
[SPEAKER_05]: The local ADU by social permit is protected ADUs.

417
00:42:02,924 --> 00:42:03,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Maximum is 900 square foot.

418
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:13,122
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to allow bigger AUs for the tax history structure.

419
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:16,805
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are incentivizing that, really.

420
00:42:19,677 --> 00:42:22,199
[SPEAKER_05]: rehabilitation of historic structures.

421
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this needs to be more than 75 years old.

422
00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:41,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the dimensions, the dimension of standards, we need to first approve the residential districts that we are working on at this moment in the Community Development Board.

423
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:51,875
[SPEAKER_05]: approved, then we can come back with national standards so that we have the newest ones.

424
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:57,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can look at those in the draft languages that we have there.

425
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,562
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're interested, we can totally pull that.

426
00:43:03,543 --> 00:43:06,005
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that would be the last one.

427
00:43:06,105 --> 00:43:07,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you check, Emily, please?

428
00:43:12,229 --> 00:43:13,190
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the last one.

429
00:43:15,615 --> 00:43:16,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

430
00:43:17,356 --> 00:43:22,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we want to talk about the interactive tool.

431
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:25,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you want to do that before or after the Q&A.

432
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:32,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, can we just mention that we have it and not present it right now, because we've been talking for an hour.

433
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:36,584
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 7.40, so I want to give people a chance to ask questions.

434
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:43,628
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jimmy will be there with the interactive tool that we have.

435
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:48,311
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a map that we have on the internet.

436
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,552
[SPEAKER_05]: It's public for everyone.

437
00:43:49,632 --> 00:43:56,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has all the information of your current zoning, your current dimensions of your lot.

438
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:59,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can search your lot.

439
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:11,822
[SPEAKER_05]: go into your lot, see what are your existing, the current situation of that, what is the current zoning, what are the proposed or approved zonings in that, in that lot.

440
00:44:11,862 --> 00:44:13,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are we suggesting?

441
00:44:13,142 --> 00:44:19,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want, and if you're interested in that, it has a lot of information.

442
00:44:19,384 --> 00:44:23,265
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be updated every time that we update any of the proposals.

443
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:28,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're interested in that, he can explain that.

444
00:44:28,727 --> 00:44:29,327
[SPEAKER_05]: can be used.

445
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:31,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I posted it in the chat.

446
00:45:00,749 --> 00:45:01,691
[SPEAKER_10]: We have lost sound.

447
00:45:01,771 --> 00:45:02,332
[SPEAKER_05]: The sound went off.

448
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:05,599
[SPEAKER_05]: It went off for about 30 seconds.

449
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:05,720
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

450
00:45:12,423 --> 00:45:17,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, link to the to the chat for those who are online.

451
00:45:18,285 --> 00:45:19,066
[SPEAKER_10]: So they can look at it.

452
00:45:19,746 --> 00:45:20,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's great.

453
00:45:20,586 --> 00:45:21,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

454
00:45:21,646 --> 00:45:23,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you take this.

455
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:23,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

456
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,008
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

457
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:29,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I was just moving our mic that they're using to hear us on the zoom.

458
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:36,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll put the link to this will be on the website tomorrow and we can work down.

459
00:45:36,796 --> 00:45:42,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, some of those letters are always or 0 is like, in order to read it out.

460
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:47,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but I mean, for the people who were the ones asking.

461
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:52,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to Jimmy, he'll give it to you when we split up here.

462
00:45:53,553 --> 00:46:01,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did want to sort of move into some Q&As because this was advertised as a Q&A and there's been a whole lot of presentation and it's late.

463
00:46:02,597 --> 00:46:09,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what we've done in the past that works pretty well is to try and take alternate between Zoom and in the room.

464
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:19,717
[SPEAKER_02]: If people in the zoom want to raise their hand, if they want to ask questions, and I know that people in the room have questions.

465
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:23,779
[SPEAKER_20]: I just say 1 thing before we do that.

466
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:25,500
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, everyone.

467
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,260
[SPEAKER_20]: Zachary's here.

468
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,921
[SPEAKER_20]: Just want to say 1 thing.

469
00:46:28,623 --> 00:46:37,194
[SPEAKER_20]: And to remind everyone, I think something we have these lines when we talk zoning of the maps and what are the maximum heights and incentive zoning.

470
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:44,543
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's really important to remember that just what the zone is and what the maximum height is does not define what can happen on a lot.

471
00:46:45,204 --> 00:47:12,926
[SPEAKER_20]: you have to take what the zoning is the zone is and what the zone allows also the dimensional requirements the performance standards parking requirements you know you can't build a seven-story plus two-story incentive structure on a 3,000 square foot lot because there's not enough room for the dimensional and the parking and the daylight and that's really important to remember it's a combined assessment of all of the zoning rules that we're doing not just the top level

472
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:18,531
[SPEAKER_20]: So, if anyone has seen the presentation and says, oh, this is I don't like it.

473
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:22,095
[SPEAKER_20]: They're going to put a 7 story building on this very tiny lot next to me.

474
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:26,780
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not going to happen because the dimensional requirements don't allow it and the other requirements don't allow it.

475
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,182
[SPEAKER_20]: And I say that in both directions, right?

476
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:33,206
[SPEAKER_20]: If people are worried that buildings that they want to see built will be too small.

477
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:35,427
[SPEAKER_20]: or too big, right?

478
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:38,548
[SPEAKER_20]: It comes down to more than just what the zone is and the maximum.

479
00:47:38,668 --> 00:47:43,169
[SPEAKER_20]: It's also about the other dimensional and performance requirements that are part of the zoning ordinance.

480
00:47:43,249 --> 00:47:56,732
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's just important to recognize that and I think that's important for us to state and include as part of our presentation because I think a lot of conversation focuses on just this top line number and figure for a zone.

481
00:48:05,122 --> 00:48:07,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, Jimmy, you want to talk to the tool a little.

482
00:48:07,806 --> 00:48:10,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tool doesn't show you buildings built.

483
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:11,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows you what exists.

484
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:17,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows you the numbers of what is allowed currently under zoning for the dimensions.

485
00:48:17,398 --> 00:48:19,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shows you the numbers that would be allowed.

486
00:48:20,122 --> 00:48:21,984
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of that is that you have to put

487
00:48:23,016 --> 00:48:39,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have to put sort of, and I don't want to say common sense, but you have to like critical thinking on it and say, well, this says seven stories so that if somebody put together three or four lots or that 10,000 square foot lot, they could fit seven stories on it.

488
00:48:39,927 --> 00:48:57,490
[SPEAKER_02]: on the 3,000 square foot lot they probably could only fit three or four stories because of the parking required and then it also depends right is it four stories of commercial that has a lower amount of parking required or those apartments where you have to have

489
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: to parking.

490
00:48:59,172 --> 00:49:03,057
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people like to say to me, well, how many units can they build?

491
00:49:03,518 --> 00:49:04,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, it depends.

492
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going to build 2,000 square foot, three bedroom units?

493
00:49:09,505 --> 00:49:14,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are they going to build 800 square foot, one bedroom units, right?

494
00:49:14,572 --> 00:49:19,056
[SPEAKER_02]: You clearly, right there, you can have twice as many units if they're smaller.

495
00:49:19,076 --> 00:49:22,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it depends on what the developer is looking to do.

496
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:30,386
[SPEAKER_02]: And we meet with different developers who have different things that they want to do and that they specialize in.

497
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:36,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I prefer to do studios in bedrooms, keep them small and simple and lower cost.

498
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:39,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk to other people who are like, we're going for two

499
00:49:39,834 --> 00:49:44,416
[SPEAKER_02]: two bedrooms, and we want a pool, and this is going to be luxury condos, right?

500
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:47,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Developers are looking for different things.

501
00:49:47,477 --> 00:49:49,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think I agree with that.

502
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:53,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that Saki said this last week.

503
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:57,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important that I take a response to that.

504
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:05,543
[SPEAKER_09]: The nuance that you said, I think it's important that people have better access to what that is, because I agree with you.

505
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,144
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes some people feel better.

506
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:12,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I live on just out of my neighbor's backyard.

507
00:50:12,511 --> 00:50:14,513
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really great place.

508
00:50:14,713 --> 00:50:20,881
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to look at his stories, but actually listening to what you say, they couldn't be the same stories there anyway.

509
00:50:21,528 --> 00:50:31,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're going to need people to come up here for the Q&A to speak into the microphone so everyone can hear you.

510
00:50:31,675 --> 00:50:31,875
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

511
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:35,017
[SPEAKER_20]: They're saying to me that they can't hear the questions, but the Zoom

512
00:50:44,591 --> 00:50:48,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Closed captions is catching and catch caught almost everywhere.

513
00:50:48,214 --> 00:50:51,997
[SPEAKER_10]: There's probably a resident.

514
00:50:52,538 --> 00:50:58,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys, the last one, the zoom closed caption is not catching the questions from the people in the room.

515
00:50:59,344 --> 00:51:06,770
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only catching information that's coming through the mic and it's not perfect, but it's, it is catching most of it.

516
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:19,594
[SPEAKER_02]: So people really basically she made a comment to us about the it's sad right that she spreads her opinion on this.

517
00:51:19,654 --> 00:51:36,801
[SPEAKER_02]: We would really like to hear everybody's opinions um so why don't we now move to one of the questions we have a couple of our hands on zoom so why don't we move to iPhone 3 and uh I've asked iPhone 3 to unmute.

518
00:51:36,841 --> 00:51:36,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi

519
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:40,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I iPhone 3?

520
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:41,171
[SPEAKER_10]: You are.

521
00:51:41,251 --> 00:51:42,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address, please.

522
00:51:42,993 --> 00:51:43,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

523
00:51:44,094 --> 00:51:46,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Robyn Iretano, 50 Cherry Street, Medford.

524
00:51:48,157 --> 00:51:48,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

525
00:51:49,178 --> 00:51:49,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

526
00:51:52,522 --> 00:51:52,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

527
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:53,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right.

528
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got the timer for questions.

529
00:51:56,285 --> 00:51:57,746
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so I have a question.

530
00:51:57,766 --> 00:51:58,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, she muted herself.

531
00:51:59,348 --> 00:52:00,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

532
00:52:02,951 --> 00:52:03,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here.

533
00:52:03,552 --> 00:52:04,373
[SPEAKER_09]: We can hear you.

534
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:06,813
[SPEAKER_09]: We can hear you.

535
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:07,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

536
00:52:08,454 --> 00:52:16,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question about turning a two-family into a three-family, conveying the basement, and then about parking.

537
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:21,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead with your questions.

538
00:52:22,485 --> 00:52:23,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there more to the question?

539
00:52:23,946 --> 00:52:24,807
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the question?

540
00:52:26,295 --> 00:52:45,975
[SPEAKER_02]: could the question is can I convert my basement to an apartment in a two-family house and then the question it depends what zone right zone you're in right so some zones allow three but if you're if you're asking if that would be an ADU

541
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:58,548
[SPEAKER_02]: then that would be, if you considered that an ADU and followed the rules where it was small enough, so it would have to be under 900 square feet.

542
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:10,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the things we also haven't quite mentioned is that all the building code requirements, so the building code looks at ADUs as a unit.

543
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,663
[SPEAKER_02]: The building code doesn't understand the idea of an ADU.

544
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:31,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So, any building code rules for making us another unit apply and the one that there are two that have been brought up to me by the building commissioner that people should realize one is that all units must have two entrances and exit two exits.

545
00:53:31,969 --> 00:53:32,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

546
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:33,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you have to figure that out.

547
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:40,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have to be, you can't like exit through the other apartment, right?

548
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:45,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they can't come up into your kitchen as one of their two exits.

549
00:53:45,753 --> 00:53:51,575
[SPEAKER_02]: The exits both have to be to the exterior of the building or a shared vestibule.

550
00:53:52,035 --> 00:54:01,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other is that when you hit three units, that triggers some, that makes it technically multifamily under the building code.

551
00:54:01,258 --> 00:54:03,559
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to put in sprinklers in all the units.

552
00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:06,240
[SPEAKER_02]: which can be a very expensive upgrade.

553
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:12,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is not addressed at all under the ADU law.

554
00:54:13,565 --> 00:54:16,026
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not expecting it.

555
00:54:16,226 --> 00:54:18,167
[SPEAKER_02]: ADU law is state law.

556
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:21,089
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a city, like the city could not exempt that.

557
00:54:21,569 --> 00:54:25,552
[SPEAKER_02]: The city cannot ever change anything that is in building code.

558
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:27,713
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be changed at the state level.

559
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:36,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I didn't hear you.

560
00:54:36,637 --> 00:54:39,258
[SPEAKER_02]: The detached would be a separate building.

561
00:54:39,918 --> 00:54:46,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that's a separate building, that's not suddenly make your two-family, a three-family building, right?

562
00:54:46,601 --> 00:54:50,483
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be two buildings on one property as opposed to a multi-family building.

563
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:52,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

564
00:54:52,718 --> 00:54:54,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you had a question about parking.

565
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:55,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

566
00:54:58,323 --> 00:55:00,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it have to be one car per unit?

567
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:10,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're allowed to require one parking spot for the additional unit.

568
00:55:11,815 --> 00:55:14,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's an ADU and Medford will

569
00:55:16,177 --> 00:55:16,977
[SPEAKER_02]: be doing it right.

570
00:55:17,037 --> 00:55:26,160
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're within a half mile of high frequency transit, then we cannot require an additional parking spot.

571
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:30,401
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're within, if you're outside of the half mile of transit, then we can.

572
00:55:34,182 --> 00:56:01,368
[SPEAKER_20]: questions like these are you should contact the building department and they may be able to provide you more guidance um and you might have to wait until the the new zoning is in effect um at least in some cases and when is that is that in august the new zoning well this is getting going to get referred to the cd board it's going to go through a public hearing process it's going to take a month or two months

573
00:56:02,682 --> 00:56:03,783
[SPEAKER_02]: By August, probably.

574
00:56:04,523 --> 00:56:06,564
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our goal.

575
00:56:06,824 --> 00:56:11,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a little confused about the parking still.

576
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:17,869
[SPEAKER_08]: So could I get away with not having any parking spots?

577
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:20,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't they park on the street with the permit parking?

578
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:26,692
[SPEAKER_02]: No, so the whole whether or not you can just use street parking.

579
00:56:26,712 --> 00:56:31,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Street parking does not count as private parking, that's whether or not it's permitted.

580
00:56:33,756 --> 00:56:38,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you happen to be within a half mile of one of the T stops.

581
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:40,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I believe I am.

582
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:46,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now in Medford, it doesn't say if you're in the green line zone, you're within a half mile.

583
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:51,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle says she knows where that is and that is within the half mile.

584
00:56:51,918 --> 00:56:54,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, with Wellington station, correct?

585
00:56:59,381 --> 00:57:00,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Century Street.

586
00:57:02,582 --> 00:57:06,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Buses can also count high frequency, but we'd have to look at the

587
00:57:07,646 --> 00:57:19,689
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual i would for individual very specific location questions you'll need to email us in i mean i don't know that we can understand that but given that we were okay with

588
00:57:32,903 --> 00:57:34,224
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

589
00:57:34,504 --> 00:57:37,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean this is part of what we're looking for input on.

590
00:57:37,646 --> 00:57:42,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more helpful for us to hear what do you want or not want, right?

591
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:50,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's we're in a space where there are certain things that are required by the state law and we can answer those kind of yes or no.

592
00:57:50,694 --> 00:57:56,158
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's like will the things that are Medford options will we will we require that?

593
00:57:57,171 --> 00:58:02,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't know, and we would like people's opinions on whether or not we should acquire them.

594
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:06,239
[SPEAKER_02]: That is part of the point of some of this, is to get input on it.

595
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:09,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me now put a question in.

596
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:14,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we move to a question in the room?

597
00:58:14,485 --> 00:58:15,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

598
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,969
[SPEAKER_02]: We can come back if people have additional stuff.

599
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:26,278
[SPEAKER_20]: You can also email OCD at Medford-MA.gov, and we can work on specific questions.

600
00:58:26,759 --> 00:58:26,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

601
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we take a question in the room?

602
00:58:29,561 --> 00:58:31,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a feeling we've got several going on.

603
00:58:32,143 --> 00:58:33,425
[SPEAKER_02]: People look like they have questions.

604
00:58:33,565 --> 00:58:36,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't we start over here?

605
00:58:37,068 --> 00:58:38,890
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll make things much simpler.

606
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:42,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Anne from West Medford.

607
00:58:45,143 --> 00:58:58,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So there seems like a big difference in the map from when I last saw you guys with the expansion of urban residential districts.

608
00:58:59,295 --> 00:59:05,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was curious how that came to be and how, there's very few people in this room,

609
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:13,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think a lot of people who live in that area would be very interested, but I don't think they know that this is going on.

610
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:21,839
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you guys, we don't have a local newspaper anymore, how are we getting word out so people can, you wanna hear from people?

611
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:31,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you are hearing from the same people I recognize, I've been here before, I see a lot of people, but we're not hearing from enough.

612
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:40,514
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I might, there are also 30 people on Zoom tonight, which is one of the reasons why we're trying to make a good effort for them to be able to hear us.

613
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:45,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the resident districts have been going through the public hearing process.

614
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:49,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's been happening at the Community Development Board.

615
00:59:49,518 --> 00:59:52,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So last night, there was another hearing with 40 or 50 people on it.

616
00:59:54,307 --> 00:59:59,791
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Community Development Board, looking at the residential districts and the changes.

617
01:00:00,272 --> 01:00:14,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been trying to get the word out through the patch through Facebook through the mayor's robocalls in some cases the newsletters that we've been putting out I know that kit has been shared in other mediums as well to let people know.

618
01:00:15,672 --> 01:00:19,635
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs us about $20,000 to mail them to the city.

619
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:20,896
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't keep doing it.

620
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,599
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have the funding to do paper mailings to the citywide.

621
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is completely the untruth.

622
01:00:29,683 --> 01:00:35,588
[SPEAKER_20]: We've expanded significantly communication to the many channels we have available to us.

623
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I was last night at a book club with 13 people, and I was the only one who knew about this.

624
01:00:40,243 --> 01:00:41,783
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, yeah.

625
01:00:42,304 --> 01:00:45,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And so part of what we do is tell other people.

626
01:00:46,266 --> 01:00:48,468
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been a really strong grassroots effort.

627
01:00:49,048 --> 01:00:53,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that there were flyers that went out in West Medford about this for this evening.

628
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,232
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't put those out.

629
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:56,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who did.

630
01:00:56,312 --> 01:01:05,318
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate that somebody did, because we don't have the funding, the staff, the bandwidth to be doing paper outreach to people.

631
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:34,551
[SPEAKER_22]: so because i thought when there was going to be some tweaks to the boundaries and stuff i didn't expect the urban residential zoning to go in as far as it has and just to clarify and i think the map we're looking at are the ones that were presented last night at the community development board which one these are not i mean obviously it's germane to the discussion those are already at ceb that's what we're looking at tonight are the ones that are have not

632
01:01:35,121 --> 01:02:02,069
[SPEAKER_22]: yet started their public hearing process with these are all of the topics in zoning process are kind of occurring in tandem um i hope that some of the folks who are interested in those maps attended last night and will attend the next cdb public hearing date on that proposal specifically what is that um so the next in person it's no the community development board meetings are all remote a lot of older people they don't have

633
01:02:02,865 --> 01:02:10,733
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't been hearing from anybody who's been, I mean the people have asked for in-person and then they say do them in hybrid and then they say do them in the neighborhoods.

634
01:02:10,973 --> 01:02:12,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing our best.

635
01:02:12,114 --> 01:02:15,737
[SPEAKER_02]: The Berks school was booked tonight and so was the library.

636
01:02:16,838 --> 01:02:20,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to get out into the neighborhoods like people have asked for but it's

637
01:02:20,922 --> 01:02:22,343
[SPEAKER_02]: really technically difficult.

638
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:29,049
[SPEAKER_02]: We even have Medford TV here trying to help us with the technology, and it's just not as visible.

639
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:36,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'm a little bit reflecting that people keep saying, it's so easy to do hybrid, why don't they do more hybrid meetings?

640
01:02:36,415 --> 01:02:38,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, it's literally not.

641
01:02:38,397 --> 01:02:38,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

642
01:02:44,863 --> 01:02:47,464
[SPEAKER_02]: We started half an hour late.

643
01:02:47,504 --> 01:02:49,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's focus on the zoning.

644
01:02:49,404 --> 01:03:04,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would strongly recommend that comments on the zoning, on the residential, you send email to OCD, Office of Community Development, at medford-ma.gov, the city email, because the board is considering that.

645
01:03:04,988 --> 01:03:11,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've actually, every single comment last night, except for one, and we probably had 25 comments, maybe?

646
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:15,794
[SPEAKER_02]: between the written and the verbal, said we want more density.

647
01:03:16,274 --> 01:03:22,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we want you to be more aggressive about more density in the zoning.

648
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:26,264
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was only one person said they did this.

649
01:03:26,384 --> 01:03:31,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, it took me 35 minutes to drive from West Medford to this meeting tonight.

650
01:03:32,322 --> 01:03:33,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, because of traffic.

651
01:03:34,202 --> 01:03:34,483
[SPEAKER_11]: This is

652
01:03:56,268 --> 01:03:59,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm conveying to you what we're hearing at the board meetings.

653
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:04,991
[SPEAKER_02]: We had had a less dense version of the residential and people kept saying housing is too expensive.

654
01:04:05,771 --> 01:04:07,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Younger people want to live in smaller units.

655
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:09,272
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to live in apartments.

656
01:04:09,332 --> 01:04:12,533
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to live near the squares and districts.

657
01:04:12,673 --> 01:04:13,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what they want.

658
01:04:13,834 --> 01:04:15,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't all want to have cars.

659
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:21,452
[SPEAKER_16]: The ones that don't speak, don't speak.

660
01:04:21,752 --> 01:04:23,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's true no matter what the outcome is.

661
01:04:23,634 --> 01:04:25,175
[SPEAKER_16]: You can always criticize the outcome.

662
01:04:25,215 --> 01:04:26,316
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think you should.

663
01:04:26,476 --> 01:04:28,217
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not scientific.

664
01:04:28,558 --> 01:04:32,201
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're evolving here.

665
01:04:32,281 --> 01:04:34,763
[SPEAKER_20]: I manage a lot of meetings.

666
01:04:34,923 --> 01:04:44,891
[SPEAKER_20]: I think if we could have one voice, and if we could go back to going back to early, back and forth comments, and if we could try to keep questions to one to two minutes so that we can get a question heard, that'd be ideal.

667
01:04:45,171 --> 01:04:47,533
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we could go back to Zoom and ask the next question.

668
01:04:52,968 --> 01:04:55,029
[SPEAKER_20]: I hear that, but we have a civil process.

669
01:04:55,069 --> 01:05:00,312
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to try to take an orderly process and we'll sit here as Rick.

670
01:05:00,393 --> 01:05:05,756
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to sit here as long as we can hear everybody, but I want to hear everybody in orderly process.

671
01:05:09,843 --> 01:05:17,006
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we have a couple people on zoom as well with their hands up and they literally can't speak up unless we hit the unmute button.

672
01:05:17,426 --> 01:05:20,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So like they don't have the opportunity to to do this.

673
01:05:20,928 --> 01:05:22,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go to Liam.

674
01:05:23,189 --> 01:05:24,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

675
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:25,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm going to let

676
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:37,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Before Liam speaks, I just want to let you know that people online do not hear what is happening in the room, and they certainly can't hear when people are talking over each other.

677
01:05:37,925 --> 01:05:41,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So, for the sake of the people online, please be clear.

678
01:05:41,327 --> 01:05:43,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Liam, you should be able to unmute now.

679
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:45,156
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, can you hear me?

680
01:05:45,176 --> 01:05:45,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

681
01:05:45,837 --> 01:05:46,318
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, thank you.

682
01:05:46,338 --> 01:05:47,379
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Bill Gunning.

683
01:05:47,419 --> 01:05:48,920
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm from Hatch Road in Medford.

684
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:50,262
[SPEAKER_17]: I was curious.

685
01:05:50,422 --> 01:05:52,905
[SPEAKER_17]: I currently live on a private way with 11 houses.

686
01:05:52,925 --> 01:05:57,750
[SPEAKER_17]: I was curious if the city had any plan to help improve the infrastructure of private ways.

687
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:03,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Our private way in the last 15 years has completely deteriorated with the number of traffic.

688
01:06:03,917 --> 01:06:09,582
[SPEAKER_17]: and delivery trucks, and whenever there was work on Woburn Street, they diverted traffic down our street.

689
01:06:09,822 --> 01:06:12,264
[SPEAKER_17]: And within a year or two, I saw the street just deteriorate.

690
01:06:12,364 --> 01:06:16,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any plans to help improve the quality of private ways with this increased density?

691
01:06:17,508 --> 01:06:23,113
[SPEAKER_17]: I know our street just does not have the sand or gravel that is needed to support vehicles on the road.

692
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:27,351
[SPEAKER_20]: I can say two things about this.

693
01:06:27,872 --> 01:06:33,793
[SPEAKER_20]: Number one, this is, tonight we're talking about the Medford Square, West Medford Square, and the ADU proposal.

694
01:06:33,853 --> 01:06:35,074
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to bring that up.

695
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:36,894
[SPEAKER_20]: I will quickly answer your question.

696
01:06:37,974 --> 01:06:40,615
[SPEAKER_20]: Hatch Road is in the residential district proposal.

697
01:06:41,135 --> 01:06:46,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Part of the discussions with the Community Development Board and the planning staff around the residential district proposal was to

698
01:06:47,017 --> 01:06:56,200
[SPEAKER_20]: address and put different districts in, specifically based on the issue is have a lot of issues, some of them are topographically difficult.

699
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Essentially, they're not built up to the standard that's required by law for a public way.

700
01:07:01,341 --> 01:07:07,863
[SPEAKER_20]: My understanding of the residential district proposal proposed last night is that areas with private ways are generally.

701
01:07:09,198 --> 01:07:19,001
[SPEAKER_20]: One district of lower for that reason, in general on private ways, I would refer you to a couple of things on the city website.

702
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:28,805
[SPEAKER_20]: There's, I believe, something from our traffic and folks talking about private ways as well as maybe a police police meeting about private winners.

703
01:07:29,485 --> 01:07:50,860
[SPEAKER_20]: My understanding of the mayor's policy is that we do not have the funding to currently even maintain and improve our public ways and that the city is not using funds on private ways unless it is essentially an emergency condition where a police or fire vehicle would not be able to go down that street if it wasn't repaired.

704
01:07:51,955 --> 01:08:03,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, my biggest concern is the density around increasing from West Medford, because there's so much traffic that goes from with the street to high street to 16. it feels like I live between 3 highways during rush hour.

705
01:08:04,408 --> 01:08:12,116
[SPEAKER_17]: And now, when the density doubles, or even increase more than doubles, I just feel like the traffic is going to go beyond the quality of the roads.

706
01:08:14,976 --> 01:08:39,603
[SPEAKER_20]: option that is available to property owners on private ways is to work you know technically everyone who lives on a private way owns the private way collectively and the people who own private ways can put additional restrictions on access to their um parking and access to their private way uh so that's one difference between the private and the public way as well all right thank you um i will i mean

707
01:08:40,564 --> 01:08:44,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to post in the chat the link that Zach was talking about.

708
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,707
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we want to go to one in the room?

709
01:08:47,727 --> 01:08:52,109
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to put a comment on the topic.

710
01:08:52,249 --> 01:08:53,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

711
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:55,571
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be heard by the Zoom.

712
01:08:55,591 --> 01:08:57,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you just come to the microphone?

713
01:08:57,511 --> 01:09:03,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Who complied to the moment's additional pay review which would be requiring a special permit?

714
01:09:04,054 --> 01:09:07,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is the authority that grants those special permits to me?

715
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:13,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's an open question right now, but I think we're leaning towards Community Development Board.

716
01:09:14,858 --> 01:09:15,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the Appeals Board?

717
01:09:16,649 --> 01:09:31,321
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the zoning board tends to be more about legal issues and the community development board tends to be more about how do things impact the community and the quality of life in the community.

718
01:09:31,361 --> 01:09:37,106
[SPEAKER_02]: So they tend to do things that are more planning and judgment related and the zoning board.

719
01:09:37,146 --> 01:09:38,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been trying to have more

720
01:09:39,268 --> 01:09:47,136
[SPEAKER_02]: lawyer type on the zoning board and more people with experience in the planning and transportation and stuff on the board.

721
01:09:47,657 --> 01:09:49,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It's somewhat related to this.

722
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:55,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the city giving up more control over what is done at city to the state?

723
01:09:55,405 --> 01:10:01,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is similar to my chapter five projects where the state has more authority.

724
01:10:02,152 --> 01:10:02,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this giving

725
01:10:07,289 --> 01:10:21,976
[SPEAKER_02]: It is my understanding that we don't have, there's a certain number of things that we don't have a choice in, not choosing to give up authority, but rather the state has come in and made rules about ADUs that we don't have a choice in.

726
01:10:22,076 --> 01:10:26,057
[SPEAKER_20]: I think very simply, the state is reducing local control under 48.

727
01:10:26,217 --> 01:10:26,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

728
01:10:27,518 --> 01:10:29,519
[SPEAKER_02]: They're reducing local control.

729
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:31,039
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not giving it up.

730
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:32,760
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a choice that we're making.

731
01:10:35,937 --> 01:10:40,143
[SPEAKER_02]: And Emily, can you call who's next because my Zoom dropped.

732
01:10:40,624 --> 01:10:41,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, absolutely.

733
01:10:42,046 --> 01:10:44,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Sheila Ahrens, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

734
01:10:46,132 --> 01:10:47,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Please give your name and address.

735
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Sheila Aarons, 19 Sagamore Park.

736
01:10:53,956 --> 01:10:59,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to agree with Anne that it is very hard to get information about these meetings.

737
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:10,827
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on the list from the city that I get any sort of announcements and it never came across my phone about this meeting.

738
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:12,648
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's several

739
01:11:13,248 --> 01:11:17,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook pages that have to do with Medford, they should be posted there.

740
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:32,261
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a landline, a lot of older people still do robocalls because I do think a lot of people don't know about the meeting and if they can't come in person they would definitely, I imagine,

741
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:34,563
[SPEAKER_00]: go to a Zoom meeting.

742
01:11:35,284 --> 01:11:36,745
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a couple of questions.

743
01:11:36,805 --> 01:11:39,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's this an appropriate time.

744
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:43,511
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were going to be specifically talking about West Medford Square.

745
01:11:44,872 --> 01:11:51,918
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that Steve Pompeo was on Zoom and he's one of the best landlords in West Medford.

746
01:11:52,418 --> 01:11:54,920
[SPEAKER_00]: He really takes pride in his property.

747
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,022
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best block in West Medford.

748
01:11:58,422 --> 01:12:11,030
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my question is, we know that developers mostly are focused on their profit and don't live in our neighborhoods, come into the neighborhood and develop buildings.

749
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:17,254
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my question is, how are we going to make sure that

750
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:28,257
[SPEAKER_00]: that visually the buildings that they do develop fit in with the quality of the square.

751
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:31,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's pride of ownership.

752
01:12:33,161 --> 01:12:35,383
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's wonderful.

753
01:12:35,504 --> 01:12:46,034
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm all for increased density, but I think it's very important to create beautiful spaces that people want to come and visit.

754
01:12:46,694 --> 01:12:59,298
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's awful you go into west medford square and there's so many of the buildings that are empty and there's trash there The landlords don't really give a darn about their buildings and they need paint.

755
01:12:59,618 --> 01:13:03,659
[SPEAKER_00]: They need new awnings So what can the city do?

756
01:13:04,219 --> 01:13:14,082
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage the the uh landlords to take pride in their buildings like steve pompeo does and um, I think

757
01:13:14,722 --> 01:13:27,486
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if the landlords would care about their buildings that there would be more interest in renting these spaces because people will want to come to West Medford and visit.

758
01:13:27,826 --> 01:13:31,368
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to some of the other neighborhoods that

759
01:13:32,948 --> 01:13:34,809
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more well-maintained.

760
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:42,092
[SPEAKER_00]: You go into Winchester, you go into Newburyport, the list goes on, and there's a real pride in ownership.

761
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:45,074
[SPEAKER_00]: There's beautiful planters every summer.

762
01:13:46,434 --> 01:13:49,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Arlington, you know, I do yoga in Arlington.

763
01:13:50,076 --> 01:13:53,297
[SPEAKER_00]: They do beautiful planters out on Mass Ave.

764
01:13:53,377 --> 01:13:54,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It's summer planters,

765
01:13:54,958 --> 01:14:07,071
[SPEAKER_00]: winter they put greens, and I think those little things make a square and an area more attractive, and it encourages people to want to rent the spaces.

766
01:14:07,452 --> 01:14:11,296
[SPEAKER_00]: When they see that it looks shoddy, they don't want to come.

767
01:14:11,977 --> 01:14:16,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm asking, I guess... Sheila, we totally agree with you.

768
01:14:17,139 --> 01:14:18,239
[SPEAKER_02]: We totally agree with you.

769
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:21,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Our economic development staff have been trying to work on this.

770
01:14:21,621 --> 01:14:29,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is that there are property owners in Medford who are amazing and excellent care of their building.

771
01:14:29,283 --> 01:14:29,783
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

772
01:14:29,863 --> 01:14:32,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve is one of those excellent property owners.

773
01:14:32,704 --> 01:14:34,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are others who are not.

774
01:14:35,085 --> 01:14:36,545
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not good landlords.

775
01:14:36,846 --> 01:14:49,809
[SPEAKER_02]: We are at the point where we're just saying straight up, the vacant spaces in West Medford are there because the landlord is looking for a new tenant who will pay $100,000 in building repairs as part of renting that space.

776
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,590
[SPEAKER_02]: They're leaking in this space.

777
01:14:52,225 --> 01:14:56,547
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wealthy family that has owned it for a long time.

778
01:14:56,587 --> 01:15:01,250
[SPEAKER_02]: They own a lot of property and they have no interest in putting investment in there.

779
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:04,992
[SPEAKER_02]: They've shown no interest in selling the property to other people.

780
01:15:05,392 --> 01:15:07,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just so much that we can do.

781
01:15:07,573 --> 01:15:12,716
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an issue where if we said, oh, now vacancy taxes, it would apply to everybody.

782
01:15:13,436 --> 01:15:20,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be, you have to be very careful that you don't drive people to do things that you don't want them to do.

783
01:15:20,522 --> 01:15:25,266
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want them to just fill it with something very, I don't know that they even would.

784
01:15:25,286 --> 01:15:27,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that a vacancy tax would even hit them.

785
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:30,671
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at a vacant storefront program.

786
01:15:30,751 --> 01:15:36,596
[SPEAKER_02]: We can help provide grants to people moving into storefronts that have been vacant for more than six months.

787
01:15:37,577 --> 01:15:51,950
[SPEAKER_02]: But when the landlords won't call you back, the other storefront that's vacant in West Medford, my office has been trying to reach the owners of that property and the real estate people listed on their sign for months and they are not returning our calls.

788
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:54,753
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we supposed to do if they won't even talk to us?

789
01:15:55,273 --> 01:15:56,173
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry cleaners.

790
01:15:56,794 --> 01:15:57,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

791
01:15:57,114 --> 01:15:57,434
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.

792
01:15:57,994 --> 01:16:21,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, yes, I was talking to one of my neighbors and a friend of his Wanted to rent that space and put a gym in there, which would have been a lovely addition And the landlord that the I guess I didn't realize that there were all sorts of chemicals um dumped in that building and I don't understand why the landlord isn't

793
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:26,845
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for paying the cleanup fees for that property?

794
01:16:26,865 --> 01:16:30,148
[SPEAKER_02]: They would be if they rented it.

795
01:16:30,248 --> 01:16:32,009
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're not motivated to rent it.

796
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:33,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the problem we're dealing with.

797
01:16:33,831 --> 01:16:40,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at some ideas about doing some art programs where can we put things in the windows to not make them look so bad?

798
01:16:40,416 --> 01:16:42,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what is it that we could possibly do?

799
01:16:42,417 --> 01:16:45,880
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to add one thing, Sheila.

800
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:47,862
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for the question about sewing.

801
01:16:49,723 --> 01:17:13,815
[SPEAKER_20]: this relates to zoning by allowing especially i think in these vacant storefronts we have a lot of buildings that i don't think anyone would say are particularly attractive or that we want to keep in the long run certainly there are some but by changing the zoning use the calculus for some of these property owners um to potentially sell the property to someone who would maintain them better um and it's not um

802
01:17:14,793 --> 01:17:42,183
[SPEAKER_20]: you know again we have limited tools at our disposal because private property owners do fundamentally have the right to do what they want with their properties including if they're very wealthy to keep them unrented um but we are looking at a vacant building ordinance and other ordinances to try to address problems and the problems that you raised are two of them but specifically for zoning um right now people don't want to sell maybe if we change the zoning someone comes in and can convince them to sell that it doesn't currently

803
01:17:43,318 --> 01:17:47,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem is not that there aren't people who don't want to rent in Medford.

804
01:17:47,259 --> 01:17:48,599
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of businesses.

805
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:50,060
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to help find spaces.

806
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,601
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is actually our business vacancy rate is pretty low.

807
01:17:54,061 --> 01:17:58,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones that everybody knows about, everybody knows about because they're very visible.

808
01:17:58,462 --> 01:18:00,282
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very much in everybody's face.

809
01:18:00,782 --> 01:18:03,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have difficulty with the property owners.

810
01:18:13,325 --> 01:18:21,208
[SPEAKER_05]: There are development standards that we have in the language in the code that applies to multifamily especially.

811
01:18:22,349 --> 01:18:32,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And on those we can set some standards to make it as good as possible like saying parking go on the rear of the lot and not in the front.

812
01:18:32,692 --> 01:18:34,473
[SPEAKER_05]: In the front you could have

813
01:18:35,193 --> 01:19:03,118
[SPEAKER_05]: um according we also have the green so we want to have more planting more trees um so we have incentives to to have those things and if they are standard they can be enforced development standards and then there is the sign guidelines that could come after this process those design guidelines will help to show developers what the city wants um and so they are not to be

814
01:19:03,818 --> 01:19:19,246
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not that easy to enforce design guidelines but it tells what the community wants and so that is another thing that um and you can talk about materials about openings about style um all these type of things and that's what i'm talking about

815
01:19:21,308 --> 01:19:30,932
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should look at Steve Pompeo's building and use that as a template, because what he's done is the way the rest of the square should look.

816
01:19:31,632 --> 01:19:37,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's gorgeous, and there's no reason that the rest of the square shouldn't look like that.

817
01:19:39,035 --> 01:19:41,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in Somerville, just quickly enough.

818
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:59,573
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I know you need to move on to other people, but I really hope that we'll hold the bar high and have beautiful development instead of just, you know, patching things up so we can get more dense development.

819
01:19:59,613 --> 01:20:00,073
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

820
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:00,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

821
01:20:00,773 --> 01:20:06,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we have some more hands in the room.

822
01:20:06,795 --> 01:20:08,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Will.

823
01:20:12,067 --> 01:20:13,891
[SPEAKER_15]: I really like the way that things are going here.

824
01:20:13,911 --> 01:20:21,684
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's good we're allowing for housing, which helps with some of the revitalization, as well as contribute to the regional housing crisis.

825
01:20:26,237 --> 01:20:29,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me, sorry.

826
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:43,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, I noticed that West Bedford Square clearly has a good ring of residential intensity surrounding it, and I noticed there's a little bit less of an intense ring of residential surrounding Bedford Square, which is

827
01:20:44,424 --> 01:21:00,585
[SPEAKER_15]: uh obviously our most important square uh and i'm just wondering if you guys looked at that you know how we can make sure there's enough uh customers uh to um and so on to um really revitalize that fairly large commercial area right thank you

828
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:12,084
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to say too much on the residential district proposal, but as it relates to Medford Square, we had a lot of discussions.

829
01:21:12,864 --> 01:21:19,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford Square is circled, essentially, by the river and the highway, which create barriers.

830
01:21:20,107 --> 01:21:23,268
[SPEAKER_20]: The other issue is that on the north side of the square, you have really difficult

831
01:21:23,268 --> 01:21:28,169
[SPEAKER_20]: both topographical situation with the summit road, et cetera.

832
01:21:28,189 --> 01:21:40,533
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the residential district proposal proposed some changes in those residential zoning along high street, but we didn't think about it and those were the major issues.

833
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:44,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Also a lot of partners.

834
01:21:44,554 --> 01:21:46,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So in that area, the more

835
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:56,693
[SPEAKER_05]: thing to know is that that area has an immense amount, very intense amount of private rooms.

836
01:21:57,053 --> 01:22:03,777
[SPEAKER_05]: They are mainly almost all of them private ways and so that is very difficult to rezone.

837
01:22:04,157 --> 01:22:07,580
[SPEAKER_05]: The moment that they are a standard and they are

838
01:22:08,892 --> 01:22:12,654
[SPEAKER_05]: made public ways, then it could be rezoned as higher.

839
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:16,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally agree with you because it's exactly, they have the services, right?

840
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:21,657
[SPEAKER_05]: They have also bus lines that are, that makes it quite frequent.

841
01:22:22,697 --> 01:22:26,419
[SPEAKER_05]: But at this point right now, they are mainly private ways.

842
01:22:26,939 --> 01:22:31,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that happens a lot in all the North area of-

843
01:22:37,032 --> 01:22:47,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Governors Avenue, there is quite a deep, steep topography, so parking makes it very difficult in that area that is in here.

844
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:54,050
[SPEAKER_16]: So everything behind the high school is a private way.

845
01:22:54,090 --> 01:23:00,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are really looking at every area that can be densified in this area.

846
01:23:00,331 --> 01:23:11,714
[SPEAKER_05]: We totally understand people being why there is still a neighborhood one or a neighborhood two, especially in certain areas, but really the private ways are difficult to

847
01:23:12,974 --> 01:23:18,276
[SPEAKER_05]: to to we will continue to look um so but yeah thank you for that.

848
01:23:18,336 --> 01:23:28,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't necessarily see private ways that have any presidential significance as a negative that could be destroyed

849
01:23:41,723 --> 01:23:44,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to ask Caroline to unmute.

850
01:23:44,546 --> 01:23:46,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Caroline, you should be able to unmute now.

851
01:23:58,817 --> 01:23:59,417
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, thank you.

852
01:23:59,437 --> 01:24:02,159
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to, one comment, one question.

853
01:24:02,779 --> 01:24:12,644
[SPEAKER_18]: I am of the younger generation in Medford and I'm really looking for the city to lean into this new ADU law and take advantage of the changes from the state.

854
01:24:13,364 --> 01:24:14,745
[SPEAKER_18]: I am priced out.

855
01:24:14,765 --> 01:24:18,246
[SPEAKER_18]: I've lived in Medford for 30 years, but I cannot purchase in Medford anymore.

856
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:27,451
[SPEAKER_18]: And so this introduction of the new ADU law may allow me to offset some of the housing costs and stay in this area, if not in Medford.

857
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:38,693
[SPEAKER_18]: I did also want to comment that this ADU law is, ADUs are now protected under the Dover Amendment, as it's known.

858
01:24:38,713 --> 01:24:56,297
[SPEAKER_18]: I am assuming the city officials probably know what I'm talking about, but Dover Amendment uses such as education, religion, solar, and now ADUs are some of the most liberally regulated at the local level because the state has determined that

859
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:01,937
[SPEAKER_18]: It needs to take control a little bit away from the municipalities.

860
01:25:02,357 --> 01:25:09,143
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want the city officials to keep that in mind when applying the new state law.

861
01:25:09,523 --> 01:25:13,466
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought I heard one of the speakers say that unless it's explicitly.

862
01:25:15,367 --> 01:25:23,333
[SPEAKER_18]: listed as one of those unreasonable regulations in the new state law that it is, that the zoning, Medford zoning still applies.

863
01:25:23,453 --> 01:25:27,196
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't think, I do have a legal background in land use and zoning.

864
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:29,838
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think that's the correct analysis.

865
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:40,025
[SPEAKER_18]: And that segues into my question, who is the individual in Medford that is doing that analysis under the regulations 760 CMR 71?

866
01:25:43,207 --> 01:25:55,218
[SPEAKER_18]: of determining whether the current zoning unreasonably is regulating these ADUs, because the city is supposed to be conducting a fact-intensive analysis.

867
01:25:55,298 --> 01:25:56,880
[SPEAKER_18]: So who is that point person?

868
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:06,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting to see if Emily wanted to speak about.

869
01:26:07,499 --> 01:26:18,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just, to be clear what you're talking about, you mean we should be looking at our current zoning and saying how, what is reasonable, unreasonable under the new ADU law.

870
01:26:18,847 --> 01:26:25,912
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the presentation we just gave you was the analysis that was done by our zoning consultants.

871
01:26:25,932 --> 01:26:27,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do have a lawyer,

872
01:26:28,173 --> 01:26:35,256
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the law that did the recalcification a few years ago on our on our zoning is part of that team as well.

873
01:26:35,717 --> 01:26:41,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've been looking at the zoning to see what needs to change to be in compliance with the new ADU law.

874
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:44,801
[SPEAKER_02]: That is in fact what the presentation was that we just gave.

875
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:47,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah I'll just add to that.

876
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So we explained which pieces of the

877
01:26:50,462 --> 01:26:58,824
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be changed because of the law and which things are still an option for us to adopt or not adopt.

878
01:27:01,014 --> 01:27:02,595
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanted to add anything, Emily?

879
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:03,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, that'd be great.

880
01:27:04,436 --> 01:27:14,022
[SPEAKER_10]: So Caroline, as Alicia said, the analysis that Pally gave is that we've looked at the current ordinance.

881
01:27:14,242 --> 01:27:16,283
[SPEAKER_10]: The current ordinance does not comply.

882
01:27:16,723 --> 01:27:28,670
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we are making recommendations to bring the city into compliance, A, with the protected ADU requirements, and then B, with the ability for the local options.

883
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:37,240
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that was, as Alicia said, that was the full presentation that was made as our recommendations to address both of those.

884
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:42,767
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess my question more specifically is in the interim, who is making those

885
01:27:44,972 --> 01:27:49,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Judgment calls you mean if somebody applies now, uh, correct.

886
01:27:49,675 --> 01:27:50,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, got it.

887
01:27:50,915 --> 01:28:12,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, alicia, do you want to handle who you are, uh at the city level actually, um It's always building commissioner is the building commissioner is the legal entity responsible for zoning and for enforcing enforcement of the zoning Thank you Did you have an opinion about the zoning you wanted to share or you just wanted?

888
01:28:13,468 --> 01:28:16,970
[SPEAKER_02]: to ask a question, because we have another question in the room we could go to.

889
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:17,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

890
01:28:21,493 --> 01:28:23,635
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, what was that question to me?

891
01:28:28,578 --> 01:28:30,539
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they were just wondering if you were done, Caroline.

892
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:31,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you.

893
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:33,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

894
01:28:36,163 --> 01:28:37,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead in the room then.

895
01:28:40,966 --> 01:28:42,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, room, we can't hear you.

896
01:28:56,242 --> 01:29:00,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to message the room and let them know that we can't hear them.

897
01:29:16,274 --> 01:29:17,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if we've lost the room.

898
01:29:18,677 --> 01:29:26,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Sharon, I am going to ask you to unmute so at least I can hear your question and maybe answer it.

899
01:29:26,503 --> 01:29:29,326
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe in the meantime, we will get the room back.

900
01:29:29,486 --> 01:29:32,829
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Sharon, if you can unmute.

901
01:29:32,849 --> 01:29:35,391
[SPEAKER_19]: I just, it's more of a comment.

902
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:37,633
[SPEAKER_19]: It was talk about the ways.

903
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:41,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

904
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:42,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, hang on.

905
01:29:42,331 --> 01:29:42,971
[SPEAKER_10]: We can now.

906
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:43,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

907
01:29:43,932 --> 01:29:44,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we can.

908
01:29:44,653 --> 01:29:48,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Sharon was just in the middle of her question, but this, we could not hear you at all.

909
01:29:48,335 --> 01:29:53,499
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just going to let her finish and then we can go back to you all because go ahead.

910
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:54,619
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

911
01:29:54,679 --> 01:29:57,221
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's more of a statement about the private ways.

912
01:29:57,802 --> 01:30:04,566
[SPEAKER_19]: Just want to let you know that with the bike paths, some people have lost their parking.

913
01:30:05,907 --> 01:30:07,288
[SPEAKER_19]: And so they're there.

914
01:30:07,328 --> 01:30:09,690
[SPEAKER_19]: We were told during meetings to park,

915
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:11,216
[SPEAKER_19]: on the private ways.

916
01:30:12,036 --> 01:30:12,337
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

917
01:30:12,397 --> 01:30:16,880
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just think that you need to look into that.

918
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:23,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Because if you're adding more parking, everyone's going to be going over to the private ways.

919
01:30:25,065 --> 01:30:26,606
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm on Winthrop Street.

920
01:30:27,427 --> 01:30:27,647
Okay.

921
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for that comment, Sharon.

922
01:30:30,441 --> 01:30:32,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll pass it back to the rest of the team.

923
01:30:32,882 --> 01:30:45,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say that for any new projects that may be proposed, people have to, if they're going to make a change, they have to have all of their parking on site.

924
01:30:45,209 --> 01:30:47,931
[SPEAKER_10]: They are not allowed to rely on on-street parking.

925
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:50,012
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will pass your comment back.

926
01:30:50,072 --> 01:30:50,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

927
01:30:51,742 --> 01:30:52,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thanks.

928
01:30:53,283 --> 01:30:58,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia, I'm going to turn it back to you and I see Paola also has her hand up.

929
01:30:58,085 --> 01:31:04,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you can hear us.

930
01:31:06,128 --> 01:31:07,149
[SPEAKER_10]: We cannot hear you.

931
01:31:07,229 --> 01:31:13,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you had just unmuted and you remuted yourself.

932
01:31:13,972 --> 01:31:15,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

933
01:31:19,114 --> 01:31:20,274
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to ask you to unmute.

934
01:31:24,199 --> 01:31:27,522
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, now, all right, we just disconnected for about a minute.

935
01:31:27,542 --> 01:31:27,802
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

936
01:31:27,842 --> 01:31:29,504
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, the hybrid Internet situation.

937
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:32,246
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not really incredibly feasible to be doing these meetings.

938
01:31:32,706 --> 01:31:38,932
[SPEAKER_20]: We had a question in the room and the question in the room was, can we talk about the process going forward?

939
01:31:39,412 --> 01:31:42,615
[SPEAKER_20]: and upcoming moments for people to further engage.

940
01:31:42,935 --> 01:31:52,004
[SPEAKER_20]: And we also confirmed that the Medford Square, West Medford Square and ADU proposals have not been approved yet.

941
01:31:52,584 --> 01:31:57,769
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now they are going to be at the city council to then be referred to the community development board.

942
01:31:58,289 --> 01:32:02,313
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's many public meetings ahead, but go back to Kit for that.

943
01:32:02,553 --> 01:32:02,854
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

944
01:32:05,481 --> 01:32:12,564
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, our one minute of lapse is a good segue into me saying just first of all, thank you everybody for hanging with us tonight.

945
01:32:13,404 --> 01:32:19,587
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a new part of the overall zoning timeline that we added in around January, February.

946
01:32:20,907 --> 01:32:24,869
[SPEAKER_22]: This is probably the one that's gotten the worst so far, so I apologize.

947
01:32:26,029 --> 01:32:32,612
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's the thing, folks have been asking, to your point, folks have been asking for

948
01:32:34,014 --> 01:32:37,457
[SPEAKER_22]: lots of opportunities to participate in this process, which is exactly what we want.

949
01:32:37,477 --> 01:32:44,101
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you all for being here today in person and on Zoom, especially tonight when it's been not as smooth as it usually goes.

950
01:32:44,521 --> 01:32:47,604
[SPEAKER_22]: Folks have been asking us to be in community spaces and to be hybrid.

951
01:32:47,664 --> 01:32:51,827
[SPEAKER_22]: And clearly there are some spaces in the community where that works a heck of a lot better than others.

952
01:32:52,587 --> 01:32:54,549
[SPEAKER_22]: And all of those spaces were not available tonight.

953
01:32:54,589 --> 01:32:55,389
[SPEAKER_22]: So we apologize.

954
01:32:55,429 --> 01:32:58,972
[SPEAKER_22]: We will not be having a zoning Q&A at the school in the future.

955
01:32:58,992 --> 01:33:00,153
[SPEAKER_22]: And thank you for being here anyway.

956
01:33:01,954 --> 01:33:11,362
[SPEAKER_22]: The recording of this meeting will be available on the zoning website as soon as possible, in addition to all of the other materials about the topics that we're talking about tonight.

957
01:33:12,865 --> 01:33:25,135
[SPEAKER_22]: To the question about process, this is something that people have probably heard before or read on the website or seen in Paola's presentations if you've attended a CBP public hearing or a planning or permanent committee meeting.

958
01:33:26,437 --> 01:33:31,741
[SPEAKER_22]: The overall timeline for every zoning topic is it originates in the planning and permanent committee.

959
01:33:32,362 --> 01:33:36,425
[SPEAKER_22]: We talk about it for as many meetings as we need to, sometimes two, sometimes four.

960
01:33:36,465 --> 01:33:38,667
[SPEAKER_22]: It is then referred to the community development board.

961
01:33:40,425 --> 01:33:50,453
[SPEAKER_22]: to the regular meeting where it is immediately referred to the Community Development Board, because that is a statutorily required process for any zoning update or amendment or new zoning.

962
01:33:50,493 --> 01:33:54,657
[SPEAKER_22]: It has to go through not only the City Council, but also a public hearing before the Community Development Board.

963
01:33:55,657 --> 01:33:58,280
[SPEAKER_22]: And then when they are done and they have voted on it,

964
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:03,401
[SPEAKER_22]: They send it back with their recommendations to the City Council and the City Council then takes a vote on it.

965
01:34:03,742 --> 01:34:08,343
[SPEAKER_22]: We vote on the proposal, we vote to adopt or not adopt the recommendation.

966
01:34:08,383 --> 01:34:10,424
[SPEAKER_22]: So how does that apply to what we're talking about tonight?

967
01:34:10,884 --> 01:34:12,684
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll just give an overview of the timeline so far.

968
01:34:12,944 --> 01:34:15,705
[SPEAKER_22]: I know there's a lot of proposals that we've discussed over the past several months.

969
01:34:17,126 --> 01:34:20,607
[SPEAKER_22]: We approved on, these are all on the website and I'll talk about that at the end.

970
01:34:21,867 --> 01:34:22,988
[SPEAKER_22]: What have we approved so far?

971
01:34:23,848 --> 01:34:30,411
[SPEAKER_22]: Phase one updates, which were mostly technical, Mystic Avenue Corridor District, Salem Street Corridor District.

972
01:34:30,771 --> 01:34:33,513
[SPEAKER_22]: And we have a lot that are somewhere in the middle of that pipeline right now.

973
01:34:33,993 --> 01:34:41,897
[SPEAKER_22]: Last night, the Community Development Board met on the Neighborhood and Urban Residential Zoning Proposal that is in the CDB that remains in the CDB.

974
01:34:41,917 --> 01:34:43,938
[SPEAKER_22]: They have not referred it back to the City Council.

975
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:49,861
[SPEAKER_22]: The proposals that we're talking about tonight, those were just referred out of the Planning and Permitting Committee.

976
01:34:50,681 --> 01:34:56,863
[SPEAKER_22]: They have not yet been referred to the Community Development Board, but that is where they're going next for the public hearings in the CDB.

977
01:34:57,643 --> 01:35:00,944
[SPEAKER_22]: After that, they will go back to the City Council.

978
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:03,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Same for the Neighborhood and Urban Residential proposals.

979
01:35:04,144 --> 01:35:14,727
[SPEAKER_22]: All of the proposals that you've seen on the timelines that we haven't yet talked about, those will start in Planning and Permanent Committee, and then go to City Council, and then go to CDB, and then go back to City Council.

980
01:35:14,887 --> 01:35:18,248
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition, we're doing these Q&As as much as possible in a more informal way,

981
01:35:18,953 --> 01:35:20,955
[SPEAKER_22]: sharing what we're working on and hearing from you.

982
01:35:22,296 --> 01:35:39,129
[SPEAKER_22]: I say all this not to just say a lot of words but to try to remind people of the opportunities along the process for plugging in and we really do appreciate you all for being here and want people to participate in as many of those modes that are accessible to you.

983
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:42,952
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition to all of that, so for example the meeting tonight

984
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:47,302
[SPEAKER_22]: a little bit difficult for folks to participate in the way that they usually do.

985
01:35:48,023 --> 01:35:52,325
[SPEAKER_22]: We will have a recording of this available on the website that people can reference.

986
01:35:52,746 --> 01:36:01,071
[SPEAKER_22]: Our inboxes are always open for receiving comments, whether it's something that's in committee or in CDB or if it's something that's on its way back to the city council.

987
01:36:02,192 --> 01:36:06,314
[SPEAKER_22]: I find a lot of value in the, you know, kind of synchronous back and forth for getting comments.

988
01:36:06,675 --> 01:36:11,918
[SPEAKER_22]: But if that doesn't work for you, if it's like tonight, the hybrid, it's a little bit hard to get information.

989
01:36:13,981 --> 01:36:19,122
[SPEAKER_22]: please contact us through whatever ways are doable for you and we do our best to get you information.

990
01:36:19,142 --> 01:36:21,383
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

991
01:36:21,423 --> 01:36:24,024
[SPEAKER_09]: So the big takeaway is we saw a lot of time.

992
01:36:24,444 --> 01:36:24,724
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

993
01:36:24,844 --> 01:36:25,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

994
01:36:25,064 --> 01:36:26,244
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I just add to that?

995
01:36:26,344 --> 01:36:28,505
[SPEAKER_20]: So really there's two parts of this.

996
01:36:28,545 --> 01:36:32,626
[SPEAKER_20]: There's creating a proposal and then the state law required public hearings.

997
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:35,672
[SPEAKER_20]: and then it being approved.

998
01:36:36,432 --> 01:36:39,215
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now, we have two sets of things.

999
01:36:39,315 --> 01:36:40,877
[SPEAKER_20]: We have the residential districts.

1000
01:36:41,757 --> 01:36:44,840
[SPEAKER_20]: We created a proposal that went to the Community Development Board.

1001
01:36:45,301 --> 01:36:46,562
[SPEAKER_20]: They opened a public hearing.

1002
01:36:47,062 --> 01:36:50,946
[SPEAKER_20]: That has now been happening over the course of three Community Development Board meetings.

1003
01:36:51,386 --> 01:36:54,149
[SPEAKER_20]: And there will be a fourth Community Development Board meeting on May 21st.

1004
01:36:55,290 --> 01:37:11,886
[SPEAKER_20]: where they may choose to make recommendations and then send that to the council and then the council would have a public hearing and then the council would vote to adopt the residential districts and consider the recommendations or make further amendments based so that's the residential districts

1005
01:37:12,367 --> 01:37:14,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And those meetings are not first.

1006
01:37:14,408 --> 01:37:17,750
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are the community board meetings are on zoom.

1007
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:20,532
[SPEAKER_20]: The city council is in city council.

1008
01:37:20,572 --> 01:37:26,135
[SPEAKER_20]: So that will be a public hearing and city council hybrid in person in the chambers and also on zoom.

1009
01:37:26,995 --> 01:37:31,658
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the final meeting where a decision is made to approve or reject the amendment.

1010
01:37:32,178 --> 01:37:35,020
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the residential districts which we weren't talking about here tonight.

1011
01:37:35,941 --> 01:37:36,962
[SPEAKER_20]: Although we ended up talking about it.

1012
01:37:37,943 --> 01:37:40,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Then there's a second grouping right now for some proposals.

1013
01:37:40,885 --> 01:37:44,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford Square, West Medford Square and the accessory dwelling unit changes.

1014
01:37:45,268 --> 01:37:49,452
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are we've essentially we've come to the point where we have a proposal.

1015
01:37:49,792 --> 01:37:52,454
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what we're talking about tonight in this Q&A.

1016
01:37:52,494 --> 01:37:53,375
[SPEAKER_20]: This is just a Q&A.

1017
01:37:53,415 --> 01:37:55,276
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not part of the formal process.

1018
01:37:56,457 --> 01:38:05,500
[SPEAKER_20]: The City Council is going to, it will be on the agenda next Tuesday for the City Council to send this to the Community Development Board for Medford Square, West Medford Square and the ADUs.

1019
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,221
[SPEAKER_20]: Then they will start their public hearings on that.

1020
01:38:08,681 --> 01:38:11,582
[SPEAKER_20]: Then they will make their recommendations and that will come back to the Council.

1021
01:38:12,142 --> 01:38:16,504
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there are three or four additional topics

1022
01:38:17,664 --> 01:38:27,491
[SPEAKER_20]: The Medford Tufts institutional zoning, the other other corridors, which essentially is just Boston Avenue and Main Street corridor, the Wellington district.

1023
01:38:28,151 --> 01:38:34,356
[SPEAKER_20]: And then kind of a grouping of city wide regulations around parking and some other regulatory items.

1024
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:36,817
[SPEAKER_20]: Those have yet to be.

1025
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:47,218
[SPEAKER_20]: We're still at that starting in the city council planning and permitting committee, and then it would go to the community development board and then it will go to the.

1026
01:38:48,218 --> 01:38:49,920
[SPEAKER_20]: Come back to the city council for approval.

1027
01:38:51,601 --> 01:38:52,762
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically, what I'm saying is.

1028
01:38:53,863 --> 01:39:18,382
[SPEAKER_20]: look out on the city website for the community development board agendas look out on the city website for the city council agendas and then there's also a page medfordma.org zoning where we are doing our best to as quickly as possible add all of the links to upcoming meetings recordings of meetings meeting materials and everything else related to zoning immediately upcoming

1029
01:39:19,163 --> 01:39:23,798
[SPEAKER_20]: The May 21st community development board hearing on the residential districts.

1030
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:24,942
[SPEAKER_20]: That is a.

1031
01:39:26,396 --> 01:39:28,017
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, another moment to be heard.

1032
01:39:28,097 --> 01:39:34,300
[SPEAKER_20]: And then they will make a recommendation after that, that will come back to the city council as early as May 27.

1033
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:39,402
[SPEAKER_20]: And then these proposals need to be advertised throughout the whole zoning process.

1034
01:39:39,442 --> 01:39:50,587
[SPEAKER_20]: So we will probably refer them out to the community development board next week, but the community development board meetings on those are likely to be in June and then come back to the council after that.

1035
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:56,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1036
01:39:57,635 --> 01:40:07,544
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're hearing from Daniel Evans that Medford Square, West Medford Square, and the ADUs would likely first be considered by the Community Development Board on June 7th.

1037
01:40:07,584 --> 01:40:09,786
[SPEAKER_20]: That's their first opening of their public hearing.

1038
01:40:11,507 --> 01:40:12,048
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1039
01:40:12,068 --> 01:40:12,528
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.

1040
01:40:19,012 --> 01:40:19,653
[SPEAKER_07]: residents.

1041
01:40:19,933 --> 01:40:20,613
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1042
01:40:20,834 --> 01:40:21,814
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an ordinance.

1043
01:40:22,155 --> 01:40:32,723
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like the zoning changes are pretty impactful, at least as much as the prop 2.5 for charter review.

1044
01:40:32,823 --> 01:40:42,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Why aren't we changing the characters of neighborhoods to be voted on by the residents?

1045
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:47,341
[SPEAKER_20]: changes to the zoning ordinance, why did they not occur by referendum?

1046
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:53,384
[SPEAKER_20]: Essentially the state, so all of our other ordinances are outlined by the charter, et cetera.

1047
01:40:53,604 --> 01:41:02,229
[SPEAKER_20]: Zoning, the state gives cities and towns the power to set their own land use and zoning under Chapter 40A, Mass General Law Chapter 48.

1048
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:07,993
[SPEAKER_20]: Mass General Law Chapter 48 outlines the process for how zoning is adopted.

1049
01:41:08,193 --> 01:41:11,975
[SPEAKER_20]: And it is through, essentially, it is actually the city council

1050
01:41:12,595 --> 01:41:15,897
[SPEAKER_20]: That is the mayor doesn't even have to sign the zoning ordinance.

1051
01:41:16,437 --> 01:41:22,981
[SPEAKER_20]: City councils, legislative bodies of cities and towns, so town meetings and city councils set zoning by state law.

1052
01:41:23,041 --> 01:41:31,626
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do have one more hand online and then we have one more in the room.

1053
01:41:32,006 --> 01:41:34,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we do the online one.

1054
01:41:40,923 --> 01:41:42,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have two more in the room.

1055
01:41:42,384 --> 01:41:44,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And Alicia, you want to handle the online part?

1056
01:41:44,605 --> 01:41:46,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Alicia.

1057
01:41:46,647 --> 01:41:49,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Roberta Cameron, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1058
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:52,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

1059
01:41:52,271 --> 01:41:59,455
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, Zach just answered one of my questions, which was going to be whether the Boston Ave corridor is in the queue.

1060
01:42:00,016 --> 01:42:05,019
[SPEAKER_23]: But I would still be interested to hear whether the Broadway corridor is

1061
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:19,626
[SPEAKER_23]: In the queue for zoning change to align with the Somerville Medford collab, the Broadway corridor plan that that was just really the other.

1062
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:22,908
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, yeah, that'll be in the other corridors as well.

1063
01:42:23,348 --> 01:42:23,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1064
01:42:24,532 --> 01:42:25,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will look at the summer.

1065
01:42:25,953 --> 01:42:27,394
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking at the summer.

1066
01:42:27,695 --> 01:42:29,656
[SPEAKER_20]: The joint, the joint proposed.

1067
01:42:29,696 --> 01:42:37,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those who don't know, there was a Somerville got a grant for Medford and Somerville to look together at Broadway's corridor.

1068
01:42:37,663 --> 01:42:48,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a, I'm going to say an 18 month project where we went with some of their staff and consultants on and Paola and Emily have that report and those recommendations.

1069
01:42:49,293 --> 01:42:50,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're taking those into,

1070
01:42:52,116 --> 01:42:55,403
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is actually the public meeting that we're planning to have.

1071
01:43:01,443 --> 01:43:05,844
[SPEAKER_02]: May 29th at Reed Hall at Tufts.

1072
01:43:06,224 --> 01:43:08,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see about whether or not we can make that hybrid.

1073
01:43:10,065 --> 01:43:11,225
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking into it.

1074
01:43:11,325 --> 01:43:20,666
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll just add for people who don't have the context, the reason that they're brought the city line between Medford and Somerville is about 10 or 20 feet behind Broadway.

1075
01:43:20,786 --> 01:43:22,647
[SPEAKER_20]: So most of the lots are in both cities.

1076
01:43:22,787 --> 01:43:29,048
[SPEAKER_20]: So this both of the cities zoning needs to be the same or similar so that they can build on those lots.

1077
01:43:30,344 --> 01:43:30,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not.

1078
01:43:31,266 --> 01:43:32,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best.

1079
01:43:34,389 --> 01:43:36,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we're going to go to one in the room.

1080
01:43:36,611 --> 01:43:38,252
[SPEAKER_23]: Wait, I had another question.

1081
01:43:38,452 --> 01:43:39,453
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't finish.

1082
01:43:39,933 --> 01:44:02,368
[SPEAKER_23]: My other question was whether the zoning that you presented this evening, my apologies if this was covered in the beginning and I didn't catch it, but did the areas or has the zoning in any way been updated to reflect the existing condition of mixed use development along High Street west of West Medford Square toward the border with Arlington?

1083
01:44:03,008 --> 01:44:05,530
[SPEAKER_23]: and Boston Avenue toward the river.

1084
01:44:07,691 --> 01:44:11,353
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that we will look in the next meeting as well.

1085
01:44:11,373 --> 01:44:16,956
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will be part of the other corridors and we will be looking at exactly those.

1086
01:44:18,117 --> 01:44:22,920
[SPEAKER_23]: So the high street west of West Medford Square will be in the other corridors section?

1087
01:44:23,818 --> 01:44:24,118
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

1088
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:37,290
[SPEAKER_02]: To be clear, all of those that are literally corridors are being considered together other than Mystic Ave and Salem Street, which we had very active development pressure on.

1089
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:50,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually now meeting with a developer who has been very anxious to build on Salem Street, who is looking to do exactly what we talked about with ground floor commercial and a couple of stories of apartments on top.

1090
01:44:51,362 --> 01:44:53,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's looking to exactly do that.

1091
01:44:53,063 --> 01:44:56,385
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not allowed under our previous zoning on that stretch.

1092
01:44:56,725 --> 01:45:00,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a building that is right now ground floor commercial with nothing on top of it.

1093
01:45:01,047 --> 01:45:03,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is exactly what we were looking for.

1094
01:45:04,068 --> 01:45:13,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So because we'd had some developers who were trying to do stuff and they were trying to go through zoning and people were trying to ram things down our throats, we said, let's get that zoned.

1095
01:45:15,053 --> 01:45:18,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go to, we're good Roberta, we're gonna go to one in the room.

1096
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1097
01:45:22,141 --> 01:45:24,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Mildred McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

1098
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:26,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have three quick questions and I'll be brief.

1099
01:45:27,108 --> 01:45:28,630
[SPEAKER_06]: One is about the interactive map.

1100
01:45:29,230 --> 01:45:30,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for making it.

1101
01:45:30,272 --> 01:45:31,674
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really awesome.

1102
01:45:32,354 --> 01:45:34,017
[SPEAKER_06]: My question about it is...

1103
01:45:35,621 --> 01:45:43,325
[SPEAKER_06]: dived in too heavily, but the nuances that were referred to earlier, will those be, will those show in the interactive map?

1104
01:45:43,385 --> 01:45:59,052
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking at the interactive map at a particular property, will you be able to tell some of the nuances that were mentioned earlier about, or will you just see, oh, they can go seven stories, but the nuances that might prevent that, will those show in the interactive map?

1105
01:45:59,593 --> 01:46:00,473
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one question.

1106
01:46:00,833 --> 01:46:03,474
[SPEAKER_06]: My other question is for the squares.

1107
01:46:05,473 --> 01:46:10,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this process at all look at some of the traffic issues or particular hairy intersections?

1108
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:21,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking in particular of the Route 60 and Playstead and Harvard Ave where the commuter rail crosses, where the train crosses, and it's pretty precarious right now.

1109
01:46:21,681 --> 01:46:29,165
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there's some concern of residents that increased density could create safety issues and difficulties.

1110
01:46:29,265 --> 01:46:31,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And so how does this process incorporate that?

1111
01:46:32,407 --> 01:46:36,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you don't know what's going to happen exactly as a result of the zoning.

1112
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:37,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that's part of it.

1113
01:46:37,271 --> 01:46:40,933
[SPEAKER_06]: But just wondering where along the line, maybe does that come in?

1114
01:46:40,953 --> 01:46:46,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And my third question is a little unrelated to the squares, but since private ways have come up.

1115
01:46:48,078 --> 01:46:57,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be wrong about this, but my understanding is that there's a process to change private ways to public ways, and that could potentially be initiated by the City Council.

1116
01:46:57,425 --> 01:47:03,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And since we have so many, and based on the map I looked at, sometimes they cover a whole neighborhood, like Lawrence Estates, for instance.

1117
01:47:04,971 --> 01:47:12,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Has the City Council ever considered trying to make some of those roads that really do function as public ways, public ways?

1118
01:47:12,636 --> 01:47:13,557
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are my questions.

1119
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:22,005
[SPEAKER_20]: On private ways, the answer is we've looked at it, and it's the cost is exorbitant.

1120
01:47:22,145 --> 01:47:28,331
[SPEAKER_20]: So, 100 to 500Million dollars, potentially more than that to bring all the public and that's like ballparky.

1121
01:47:28,351 --> 01:47:30,373
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't that's not what tariffs.

1122
01:47:31,013 --> 01:47:32,154
[SPEAKER_20]: But, uh.

1123
01:47:35,318 --> 01:47:41,499
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so either the city could, if the city somehow came into a couple billion dollars, we'd all be very happy.

1124
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,820
[SPEAKER_20]: And maybe that would be a project we could consider.

1125
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:53,442
[SPEAKER_20]: But the other thing is that the owners of a private way currently can pay to bring it up to a standard to be adopted as a public way.

1126
01:47:54,522 --> 01:47:55,943
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's how that would work.

1127
01:47:55,963 --> 01:47:59,664
[SPEAKER_20]: But we have looked at it and the issue is the infrastructure cost.

1128
01:48:00,104 --> 01:48:05,245
[SPEAKER_20]: The city can't adopt a private way as a public way unless it is outfitted to the standard of a public way.

1129
01:48:05,405 --> 01:48:10,348
[SPEAKER_20]: which includes stormwater, sidewalks, ADA compliant, I mean the whole thing.

1130
01:48:11,209 --> 01:48:16,192
[SPEAKER_20]: It's also one of the reasons that full street reconstruction costs so much right now these days.

1131
01:48:17,172 --> 01:48:27,479
[SPEAKER_20]: On the traffic question, the main answer is the traffic impact of specific projects would be determined based on a project proposal and the site plan review process.

1132
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:34,743
[SPEAKER_20]: But we have a we have development linkage fees for that go towards this infrastructure so that

1133
01:48:36,153 --> 01:48:40,196
[SPEAKER_20]: pay into a linkage fee structure which we're trying to update hasn't been updated in 35 years.

1134
01:48:40,216 --> 01:48:49,662
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're trying to update it to reflect current day prices and not 1990 prices, but that money can be used by the city for infrastructure improvements.

1135
01:48:50,223 --> 01:48:55,226
[SPEAKER_20]: And the other piece of this is that we've also included it through the incentive zoning that one of the potential

1136
01:48:58,839 --> 01:49:14,835
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have seen this as part of several developments in the area that a big piece of what they do is they do kind of bring the street into a modern street design so either just the pure infrastructure improvements and potentially like implementation of designs at the

1137
01:49:17,015 --> 01:49:22,896
[SPEAKER_20]: need to actually do the construction could be part of new structures in the neighborhood.

1138
01:49:22,996 --> 01:49:34,799
[SPEAKER_20]: So if, for example, the Walgreens area was redeveloped into something more significant, one of the benefits could be we need to redo this corridor to make it much cleaner and safer for traffic.

1139
01:49:36,059 --> 01:49:40,460
[SPEAKER_20]: But one of the flip side issues that Emily or Paolo could explain much better than I

1140
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:47,164
[SPEAKER_20]: Is we can make an assumption that everything that could possibly get built will get built, but we know that that's not going to happen.

1141
01:49:47,204 --> 01:49:54,608
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's where the trying to figure out what the traffic impact is without project proposals is kind of a hypothetical.

1142
01:49:54,628 --> 01:49:54,829
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

1143
01:49:55,469 --> 01:49:58,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I might actually just add that there's something that we.

1144
01:49:59,185 --> 01:50:22,395
[SPEAKER_02]: been learning more we've been getting more versed about under this mayor and with our new economic development director and that there are mass development grants that can help with some of this major infrastructure improvements but they have to be tied to a new development or a potential new development so if we did have a developer who said I want to do this building at Walgreens site and it's going to be big

1145
01:50:23,115 --> 01:50:27,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And we said, yeah, but we really need to upgrade this railroad crossing.

1146
01:50:27,223 --> 01:50:29,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And the developer says, but I don't want to pay for that.

1147
01:50:29,867 --> 01:50:32,652
[SPEAKER_02]: That is exactly what a mass development grant would be for.

1148
01:50:36,728 --> 01:50:40,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry, but there is no new building going in the west.

1149
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:42,230
[SPEAKER_20]: The condos at the old funeral home.

1150
01:50:42,651 --> 01:50:44,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the condos at the old funeral home.

1151
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:47,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, that is not a big enough development, right?

1152
01:50:47,112 --> 01:50:48,573
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's actually quite small.

1153
01:50:48,733 --> 01:50:52,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It's eight or nine units with one with a cafe on the first floor.

1154
01:50:53,035 --> 01:50:56,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not big enough to trigger a mass development grant and to look for it.

1155
01:50:57,957 --> 01:51:06,962
[SPEAKER_02]: deeper, it would be for much bigger projects but like the kind that might have a real impact on the water and sewer system, you can get a mass development grant to help with that.

1156
01:51:07,303 --> 01:51:16,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I will also say that this is something that I think the city may have done quietly in the past, and maybe lost track of because we haven't seen it all in

1157
01:51:16,848 --> 01:51:18,229
[SPEAKER_02]: in the last 10 years.

1158
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:24,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Our current economic development director has extensive experience and connections with mass development.

1159
01:51:24,395 --> 01:51:27,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk with them extremely frequently about projects.

1160
01:51:27,938 --> 01:51:38,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually the Medford Square RFP, for example, we have had staff from mass development who have been meeting with us at every single meeting, interview with developers.

1161
01:51:38,307 --> 01:51:42,331
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually paid for the consultant to write the RFP.

1162
01:51:43,452 --> 01:51:45,793
[SPEAKER_02]: for the city-owned parking lots in Medford Square, right?

1163
01:51:46,094 --> 01:51:54,659
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the kind of thing that we have been really taking advantage of in the last couple of years that we haven't seen on this scale before.

1164
01:51:55,099 --> 01:52:01,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're saying, you know, depending what we need there, like, those are the kinds of things we could see these bigger grants for.

1165
01:52:01,923 --> 01:52:05,966
[SPEAKER_02]: But there has to be an associated project, right?

1166
01:52:05,986 --> 01:52:12,710
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be a developer saying, I want to do this here in order for us to be eligible for those kinds of grants.

1167
01:52:13,759 --> 01:52:15,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping we'll see more of them.

1168
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:22,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was the last question with the interactive map, and Jimmy will tell us what it can do.

1169
01:52:22,103 --> 01:52:22,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy Nader.

1170
01:52:23,283 --> 01:52:28,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I'll answer the question on, does it show the nuance in the zoning that we're proposing?

1171
01:52:28,185 --> 01:52:28,886
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the question.

1172
01:52:28,906 --> 01:52:35,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like what Zach earlier was saying how, you know, if you look and see, oh, nine stories can go up here.

1173
01:52:36,717 --> 01:52:45,423
[SPEAKER_06]: with the incentive and you live near it and you're freaked out about that, it might not necessarily be true because there's other factors that would prevent that from going up.

1174
01:52:45,463 --> 01:52:46,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, that's a good question.

1175
01:52:46,824 --> 01:52:51,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't show the exact nuance that's in the zoning code, the proposed or approved.

1176
01:52:51,747 --> 01:52:57,631
[SPEAKER_01]: For that, I would recommend there's a link on the map that you can click on to get more information of what Paola and Emily and

1177
01:52:58,451 --> 01:52:59,733
[SPEAKER_01]: the city are suggesting.

1178
01:53:00,493 --> 01:53:10,944
[SPEAKER_01]: The map is meant to show existing conditions, our existing conditions analysis of Medford for each parcel, as well as what we're proposing just for dimensions.

1179
01:53:11,765 --> 01:53:16,169
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't show the specific nuances, but for that, I would just refer to the city's website.

1180
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:20,013
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I- Quickly, I think- Yeah.

1181
01:53:24,155 --> 01:53:31,422
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think somebody else asked this earlier, which is if you're trying to do that overlay, like, okay, I see that this is proposed for this subdistrict.

1182
01:53:31,943 --> 01:53:38,008
[SPEAKER_22]: What are the lot size requirements for x type of building in this subdistrict?

1183
01:53:38,449 --> 01:53:44,134
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that would be a cross-referencing exercise because I think that would be bulky for Jimmy's map to accommodate.

1184
01:53:44,515 --> 01:53:45,215
[SPEAKER_22]: So in that case,

1185
01:53:47,177 --> 01:53:53,001
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the thing to do would be to refer to the proposed zoning, which is linked to the zoning website attached to meeting agendas.

1186
01:53:54,022 --> 01:53:55,203
[SPEAKER_22]: Obviously, I wish it was simpler.

1187
01:53:55,243 --> 01:54:07,331
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a lot to fit into the ArcGIS, but hopefully being able to reference this is a sub-district that's proposed, and over here in the dimensionals, these are the lot size, et cetera, for example, the setback requirement.

1188
01:54:09,310 --> 01:54:15,815
[SPEAKER_22]: For this type of lot for the sub district to at least give you an idea of what is what is ineligible here, even though it's in the sub district.

1189
01:54:16,016 --> 01:54:17,277
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think the map is awesome.

1190
01:54:17,297 --> 01:54:18,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

1191
01:54:18,598 --> 01:54:23,041
[SPEAKER_20]: The other thing I'll point to is, and it's more for the squares.

1192
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:29,487
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I haven't I don't know if I saw them for residential districts, but you've put together some kind of cross sections.

1193
01:54:29,547 --> 01:54:30,468
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, what what would.

1194
01:54:31,248 --> 01:54:35,691
[SPEAKER_20]: it looked like between Mystic Valley Parkway and High Street under this new zoning.

1195
01:54:36,592 --> 01:54:45,778
[SPEAKER_20]: There was also, I think, a couple of references to some of these and then some of the daylight standards to illustrate more.

1196
01:54:45,838 --> 01:54:48,040
[SPEAKER_20]: The real problem is it's all layered on top of each other.

1197
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:49,701
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, what is the daylight standard?

1198
01:54:49,721 --> 01:54:50,602
[SPEAKER_20]: What's the dimensional?

1199
01:54:50,682 --> 01:54:51,682
[SPEAKER_20]: What's the allowed zone?

1200
01:54:52,283 --> 01:54:54,364
[SPEAKER_20]: What's the neighboring condition of the neighboring lots?

1201
01:54:55,668 --> 01:55:03,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And also we need to also give some flexibility because you could say you need X amount of parking.

1202
01:55:04,912 --> 01:55:07,013
[SPEAKER_05]: But then with the parking, you could share it.

1203
01:55:07,213 --> 01:55:12,516
[SPEAKER_05]: You could say the next lot will have the parking so I could go higher.

1204
01:55:12,576 --> 01:55:15,137
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a lot of things that could happen.

1205
01:55:15,597 --> 01:55:19,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So we cannot say yes, no, because it's not so much black or white.

1206
01:55:20,359 --> 01:55:23,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a lot of variables that needs to

1207
01:55:24,511 --> 01:55:25,512
[SPEAKER_05]: be taken into account.

1208
01:55:25,552 --> 01:55:27,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So it makes it quite difficult.

1209
01:55:27,113 --> 01:55:35,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically the map is great and it gives you good general information, but don't make assumptions about individual parcels based on the general information.

1210
01:55:35,862 --> 01:55:39,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can look, it does have the dimensional standard.

1211
01:55:39,305 --> 01:55:43,949
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can look very easily if you are under that minimum required.

1212
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:47,893
[SPEAKER_05]: So those kinds of things, it's very easy to setbacks.

1213
01:55:48,313 --> 01:55:49,174
[SPEAKER_05]: That is all there.

1214
01:55:49,882 --> 01:56:01,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But then there are other things as parking requirement and development standards as in the section that also protects more the residential neighborhoods.

1215
01:56:01,549 --> 01:56:01,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1216
01:56:02,289 --> 01:56:04,731
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one more question online.

1217
01:56:04,951 --> 01:56:13,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I keep saying that, but then there's always, I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but one more person just raises their hand every time there's the last person.

1218
01:56:14,356 --> 01:56:17,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go to the one online and then we have another in the room.

1219
01:56:17,993 --> 01:56:18,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, great.

1220
01:56:18,473 --> 01:56:21,335
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to ask Loretta James to unmute.

1221
01:56:21,755 --> 01:56:24,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Loretta, you should be able to unmute now.

1222
01:56:24,336 --> 01:56:25,797
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, thank you.

1223
01:56:26,677 --> 01:56:27,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me?

1224
01:56:27,778 --> 01:56:28,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I can.

1225
01:56:28,418 --> 01:56:29,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, good.

1226
01:56:29,639 --> 01:56:31,039
[SPEAKER_21]: I just have some general questions.

1227
01:56:31,079 --> 01:56:31,540
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll be quick.

1228
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:39,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Does the new proposed zoning change or abolish the historic commission review?

1229
01:56:40,324 --> 01:56:41,144
[SPEAKER_21]: Not at all.

1230
01:56:41,844 --> 01:56:43,465
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I was curious about that.

1231
01:56:43,485 --> 01:56:45,446
[SPEAKER_21]: So homes 75 years or older

1232
01:56:48,259 --> 01:56:51,401
[SPEAKER_21]: they're proposed for demolition, so we have to go through them?

1233
01:56:52,361 --> 01:56:53,442
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely, yes.

1234
01:56:53,742 --> 01:56:54,142
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

1235
01:56:54,842 --> 01:57:00,565
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have... Did someone else say something?

1236
01:57:00,585 --> 01:57:01,766
[SPEAKER_21]: No, you're okay, Laura.

1237
01:57:01,926 --> 01:57:02,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

1238
01:57:02,586 --> 01:57:12,971
[SPEAKER_21]: So I have questions about when you're writing suggestions or comments to the Community Development Board or the City Council,

1239
01:57:18,797 --> 01:57:22,498
[SPEAKER_10]: If the room can mute so that Loretta can speak, that'd be helpful.

1240
01:57:22,898 --> 01:57:23,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

1241
01:57:26,099 --> 01:57:28,299
[SPEAKER_09]: We can hear Loretta.

1242
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:29,619
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1243
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:30,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1244
01:57:30,879 --> 01:57:31,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1245
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:44,442
[SPEAKER_21]: So when you're writing comments or suggestions to the community development board or the city council, I never know how those are answered or how are those addressed.

1246
01:57:47,483 --> 01:58:02,954
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's addressed to the Community Development Board, then we put all of those in a packet for the Community Development Board members to read all of those messages.

1247
01:58:03,614 --> 01:58:10,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we'll get a message with a very specific individual question and one of the staff will be able to answer it.

1248
01:58:10,959 --> 01:58:23,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we get very long messages with 30 questions in them and we do not have the bandwidth to answer all of those, but we have been trying to sort of shoot back responses to straightforward questions.

1249
01:58:24,368 --> 01:58:27,730
[SPEAKER_02]: The city counselors all answer theirs individually.

1250
01:58:27,831 --> 01:58:29,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Zach is offering that.

1251
01:58:30,152 --> 01:58:32,613
[SPEAKER_20]: Comments made to the City Council, written comments.

1252
01:58:33,893 --> 01:58:35,773
[SPEAKER_20]: Each individual Councillor reads them.

1253
01:58:35,993 --> 01:58:37,774
[SPEAKER_20]: They can choose to respond individually or not.

1254
01:58:38,694 --> 01:58:48,596
[SPEAKER_20]: If someone in their written comment requests that it be read out loud in a meeting and it's not 20 pages long, we generally do our best to read them out at the meeting.

1255
01:58:49,056 --> 01:58:59,338
[SPEAKER_20]: If you really are intent on a written comment being read during the meeting, I would recommend including the City Clerk on your comment and mentioning, please read this in the meeting.

1256
01:59:00,218 --> 01:59:05,362
[SPEAKER_20]: maybe even emailing the city clerk directly, he can help us just keep that organized as well.

1257
01:59:05,983 --> 01:59:09,946
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's a little bit different than how it works for the Community Development Board.

1258
01:59:10,806 --> 01:59:13,849
[SPEAKER_20]: Each councilor handles that in their own way.

1259
01:59:14,049 --> 01:59:15,230
[SPEAKER_21]: Whether or not they choose to respond.

1260
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:22,676
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess I get why, because sometimes city council say, oh, you should write in to us, and then the Community Development Board go, oh, write in to us.

1261
01:59:23,216 --> 01:59:25,278
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I don't know what happens to the suggestions.

1262
01:59:26,499 --> 01:59:30,923
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we just don't have the bandwidth to respond individually to all of them.

1263
01:59:31,404 --> 01:59:37,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tend to put all that information together for the board.

1264
01:59:37,991 --> 01:59:41,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we'll do some verbal summaries during the meeting, depending on.

1265
01:59:42,215 --> 02:00:11,548
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of what the situation is um the other thing is we're not sending every single comment to the consultants because the consultants don't need to see the same comments over and over again however sometimes when there's something that's robust or different or a different perspective or if we feel that it highlights what we want them to change so part of it is also what we've talked with the consultants about is just because a resident says they want something doesn't mean they should incorporate it

1266
02:00:11,989 --> 02:00:16,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you might imagine that we get directly conflicting comments from the public.

1267
02:00:17,199 --> 02:00:21,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So they need to hear from either the board, the staff, or the counselors.

1268
02:00:21,879 --> 02:00:23,640
[SPEAKER_02]: this we want you to incorporate.

1269
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:26,102
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one that we want you to accommodate.

1270
02:00:26,742 --> 02:00:34,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do filter what goes to them because also we pay them by the hour and nobody wants us to pay them to read every single comment.

1271
02:00:35,688 --> 02:00:41,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to give them more direction from us rather than them seeing all the comments.

1272
02:00:41,792 --> 02:00:43,033
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1273
02:00:43,153 --> 02:00:45,074
[SPEAKER_21]: And I understand that.

1274
02:00:45,615 --> 02:00:50,718
[SPEAKER_21]: The same with residents and myself in particular, I didn't want to repeat because

1275
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:57,065
[SPEAKER_21]: I've already mentioned a few things to do, you know, the city council or the community development board.

1276
02:00:57,105 --> 02:00:59,507
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know where they went.

1277
02:01:00,007 --> 02:01:03,970
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's why I was asking the question, do I have to keep coming in?

1278
02:01:04,311 --> 02:01:07,553
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'll give you an example for parking for ADUs.

1279
02:01:08,034 --> 02:01:10,796
[SPEAKER_21]: I had asked, well, can we share a driveway?

1280
02:01:11,297 --> 02:01:16,821
[SPEAKER_21]: And is that considered a space for a required parking space for an ADU?

1281
02:01:16,901 --> 02:01:17,662
[SPEAKER_21]: And I never heard back.

1282
02:01:17,702 --> 02:01:18,903
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm like,

1283
02:01:20,759 --> 02:01:32,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is part of where we're trying to work through what is legally required, what we're allowed to do through the state, and what's allowed by the building code.

1284
02:01:33,508 --> 02:01:44,876
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these things, we have had questions, we go back to consultants, we go back to the state, and then we get told by the lawyers that somebody is going to have to decide this or that issue in the courts.

1285
02:01:46,057 --> 02:02:06,290
[SPEAKER_02]: it is not all very completely clear so the question about shared it depends do you mean you share it with your neighbor or do you mean that you have a driveway that accommodates four cars already in your single family house and you're adding an adu right then you're all so it's very very specific right so in that case the single family house requires two

1286
02:02:07,090 --> 02:02:11,474
[SPEAKER_02]: The adu Probably can requires one depending on where it is.

1287
02:02:12,035 --> 02:02:24,247
[SPEAKER_02]: You have four spots in your driveway Um, so you're good, right if you're saying we have two spots in our driveway and your single family house requires two Can the adu require one?

1288
02:02:24,507 --> 02:02:26,089
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, that's it.

1289
02:02:26,429 --> 02:02:29,772
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be one for the adu and two for the single family house

1290
02:02:30,787 --> 02:02:36,033
[SPEAKER_02]: That's but this is the kind of like, it's more complicated than just can we share it or not.

1291
02:02:36,233 --> 02:02:38,076
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's even if they don't have a car.

1292
02:02:38,096 --> 02:02:38,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1293
02:02:38,516 --> 02:02:42,681
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have anything to do about what the current people own at that time.

1294
02:02:43,382 --> 02:02:45,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you never know who's going to move in next.

1295
02:02:46,626 --> 02:02:47,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1296
02:02:47,895 --> 02:02:51,756
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I would also just add that if people have a question like, what can I do?

1297
02:02:52,417 --> 02:02:53,397
[SPEAKER_20]: At least what can I do now?

1298
02:02:53,597 --> 02:02:56,378
[SPEAKER_20]: The building department is really responsive on questions like that.

1299
02:02:56,978 --> 02:02:58,639
[SPEAKER_20]: And they're the ones who can tell you.

1300
02:02:58,739 --> 02:02:59,699
[SPEAKER_20]: They enforce the zoning bill.

1301
02:02:59,779 --> 02:03:01,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good thing to say.

1302
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:06,561
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody is looking or curious about whether they can do the ADU thing, ask the building department.

1303
02:03:06,821 --> 02:03:12,103
[SPEAKER_02]: But you actually have to show them, this is my house, this is my driveway, this is my land, this is what I'm thinking about.

1304
02:03:12,483 --> 02:03:17,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Because every single answer is, it depends on your very specific situation.

1305
02:03:18,988 --> 02:03:26,697
[SPEAKER_21]: I was thinking of like, often in South Medford, you know, where there's two families or three families that are condos, they share the driveways.

1306
02:03:27,378 --> 02:03:29,280
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's two or three spots.

1307
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:30,781
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm like, well, can we do the same?

1308
02:03:30,801 --> 02:03:36,588
[SPEAKER_21]: If it's a residential single family, and you have, you know, a three car driveway,

1309
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:39,581
[SPEAKER_21]: would that apply to the same?

1310
02:03:40,101 --> 02:03:48,929
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is one of the really challenging things about parking mandates and minimums is like a lot of what people do, right?

1311
02:03:48,969 --> 02:03:57,476
[SPEAKER_20]: You might have a three car, like you can fit three car lengths in a driveway, but in order to, you know, actually you'd have to move a car to get another car out.

1312
02:03:57,977 --> 02:04:01,240
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm basically pretty sure that doesn't count as a parking space, right?

1313
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:11,122
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so I believe under the code, and I could be corrected if everyone else can correct me, that you have to be able to get the car in and out independently.

1314
02:04:11,782 --> 02:04:13,983
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's what constitutes a parking space.

1315
02:04:14,583 --> 02:04:22,064
[SPEAKER_20]: So when you mandate free parking spaces, it's not, oh, the people in the building will work it out, and someone will move out at 8 AM, and someone will move their car back in.

1316
02:04:22,505 --> 02:04:25,925
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to be able to independently access that space at any time.

1317
02:04:26,485 --> 02:04:28,366
[SPEAKER_20]: So free parking spaces is actually

1318
02:04:29,026 --> 02:04:44,959
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, maybe all this square footage in your backyard, and then maybe you're over the open space requirement, or you have to do a permeable service, but it's like, it doesn't account for all of the actual heuristic behaviors that we all do every day, or that we do because we're like, trying to cooperate with each other in society.

1319
02:04:45,420 --> 02:04:50,604
[SPEAKER_20]: It's literally just saying, like, you have to be able to get in and out independently, completely, and if you can't do that,

1320
02:04:54,238 --> 02:05:06,368
[SPEAKER_20]: mandate it balloons the amount of parking that you might actually think you might be saying that like a new parking space under like building a new parking space under the zoning it's very different than what we might consider as like a parking

1321
02:05:16,617 --> 02:05:31,969
[SPEAKER_20]: space that we use in an existing house every day because it doesn't factor in that use it's like you need this person who you know the parking space needs to be accessible at all times it has to be a minimum size and dimension it doesn't matter if you all have smart cars you all have escalades right it's like you have to

1322
02:05:36,557 --> 02:05:41,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to interrupt, I think Loretta was our last question online.

1323
02:05:41,519 --> 02:05:43,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there was somebody else in the room.

1324
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:44,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

1325
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:44,941
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have a question.

1326
02:05:44,961 --> 02:05:49,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and we need to start to wrap things up because we're going to get kicked out of this space pretty soon.

1327
02:05:50,423 --> 02:05:52,524
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I want to leave desperately.

1328
02:05:54,686 --> 02:05:55,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not kidding.

1329
02:05:55,847 --> 02:05:57,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not joking.

1330
02:05:57,968 --> 02:06:15,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had it with these two and three hour meetings, but I just want to know, I'm still confused about the 15 story thing and whether that was only in the abysmal current zoning or whether it's still going to be allowed anywhere.

1331
02:06:16,900 --> 02:06:23,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything between 10 and 15 stories, can you tell me whether these proposals allow it, and if so, where?

1332
02:06:24,482 --> 02:06:47,214
[SPEAKER_20]: uh the 15 the 15 story element where it said other permanent structures 15 story that's the current zoning okay in certain districts and we are not allowing that um there are some things in the approved mystic avenue corridor district between mystic avenue and the highway that i think approach that that are above 10 12 stories with incentives zoning so it's age by right and then

1333
02:06:48,695 --> 02:07:15,411
[SPEAKER_05]: with incentive zones but it's very specific areas we are having mixed use three on mystic avenue and that even goes higher i think that it reaches the 15 or 14 well it's 14 i think it's 14 but it's up against the highway yes yes exactly so it's in mystic uh on the mixed use three and in next to the city hall uh next to the 93 so those are the spots where we have that

1334
02:07:16,735 --> 02:07:39,469
[SPEAKER_05]: higher than 10 for the other areas we are not having that so it was in commercial one for hotel and apartment to other permitted yeah other permitted structures were up to 15 that's not happening in the current in our proposal we want to check that out

1335
02:07:40,025 --> 02:08:07,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and I'm just going to say one more thing because I want everyone to hear it which is that those sheets that you had of your memorandum that have the tables and those details are super helpful and it's really hard to for individuals to print out 20 to 40 page things themselves and have that accessible and if I realize you can't you know, you can't send out

1336
02:08:08,312 --> 02:08:22,801
[SPEAKER_08]: use the city street sweeping notifications to let people know when zoning meetings are going to happen that affect their area and please have a way that people can get those printed

1337
02:08:24,446 --> 02:08:35,616
[SPEAKER_08]: sets of recommendations so that they can take them home and look at them and have the kind of official, this is the proposal with the details.

1338
02:08:36,177 --> 02:08:41,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Because even your excellent presentations don't have all the details that are in there.

1339
02:08:42,082 --> 02:08:44,624
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be super helpful.

1340
02:08:45,005 --> 02:08:45,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1341
02:08:45,205 --> 02:08:51,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're starting to be able to just print out versions out of my office and hand them to you if you walk in.

1342
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:59,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the difficulty is just making sure that the staff who are at the desk know what's the most recent version.

1343
02:09:01,517 --> 02:09:05,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I always end up with this, but it depends, right?

1344
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:15,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a CD board meeting last night and we can give you the version that was presented at that meeting, but the board asked Paola and Emily to make some updates to it.

1345
02:09:15,866 --> 02:09:16,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1346
02:09:17,007 --> 02:09:26,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can hand you the version that was permit shown at that meeting, but none of us have that version yet And we're not sure when we're you know, how quickly we're going to get that then right?

1347
02:09:26,851 --> 02:09:34,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was the other problem was that I was spending Hours on the 5th, which was the day that I had time.

1348
02:09:34,414 --> 02:09:45,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I was not able to do things on the 6th um and looking all over for what is going to be presented at this meeting so that I can

1349
02:09:46,510 --> 02:09:51,393
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, be articulate instead of just saying something muddled.

1350
02:09:52,253 --> 02:09:54,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And I couldn't find anything.

1351
02:09:54,455 --> 02:09:58,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And as the meeting was going on, stuff was popping up, right?

1352
02:09:58,737 --> 02:10:00,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And that doesn't help.

1353
02:10:00,738 --> 02:10:06,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And we apologize, but that occurred because there are so many things, the materials weren't ready on the 5th.

1354
02:10:07,793 --> 02:10:09,554
[SPEAKER_02]: They literally, they weren't ready.

1355
02:10:09,594 --> 02:10:11,315
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't given to the board until the 6th.

1356
02:10:11,356 --> 02:10:19,601
[SPEAKER_02]: That is why we told the board and we said upfront, we can't ask you to vote because the materials weren't ready early enough for anybody to look at.

1357
02:10:19,942 --> 02:10:27,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I just want you to realize how hard it is for a resident to try and figure out what's going on here.

1358
02:10:27,367 --> 02:10:31,790
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're making what I consider drastic changes and

1359
02:10:33,307 --> 02:10:43,721
[SPEAKER_08]: more people have to know and more people have to have access to forms that are comprehensible by somebody that doesn't have an urban planning degree.

1360
02:10:46,447 --> 02:10:50,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we are trying to get these in the robocalls.

1361
02:10:50,430 --> 02:10:54,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that tonight's meeting was in the robocall that went out today.

1362
02:10:54,392 --> 02:11:03,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually checking my past messages to see if it went out in the last one that the mayor's office did, but we are trying to get them in the robocalls.

1363
02:11:04,098 --> 02:11:07,680
[SPEAKER_02]: The difficulty is everybody cares about West Medford and Medford Square.

1364
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:33,505
[SPEAKER_02]: right this is not well just your neighborhood we want everybody to know about it and everybody who lives in medford cares about the residential zoning um when we did the the individual when we did salem street we did a robocall around just salem street area um so we are trying to do those targeted ones when it makes sense but everybody cares about these okay but i didn't see this in any of the mayor's um

1365
02:11:34,525 --> 02:11:42,175
[SPEAKER_08]: emails about, you know, these zoning meetings and it's really a big deal.

1366
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:58,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to tell you that there is a new news outlet in Medford doing online only.

1367
02:11:58,402 --> 02:12:02,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want you to know they've been on this meeting all night.

1368
02:12:03,063 --> 02:12:03,263
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

1369
02:12:03,983 --> 02:12:06,684
[SPEAKER_20]: It's hard to remember their name.

1370
02:12:07,484 --> 02:12:09,625
[SPEAKER_20]: You've just got to know it.

1371
02:12:09,825 --> 02:12:11,206
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're on here tonight, and they're trying.

1372
02:12:11,286 --> 02:12:12,446
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are, again, only online.

1373
02:12:16,198 --> 02:12:19,419
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried really hard to bring in a print newspaper.

1374
02:12:19,439 --> 02:12:22,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked with Dan.

1375
02:12:22,141 --> 02:12:26,503
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually toured a potential newspaper around the city trying to convince them.

1376
02:12:26,603 --> 02:12:30,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, I drove a guy around the city trying to convince him to bring a newspaper to Medford.

1377
02:12:31,145 --> 02:12:33,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And they ended up deciding not to do a print newspaper here.

1378
02:12:33,786 --> 02:12:35,367
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not just Medford that this is happening.

1379
02:12:35,467 --> 02:12:36,147
[SPEAKER_07]: It's everywhere.

1380
02:12:36,167 --> 02:12:36,967
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tough.

1381
02:12:37,148 --> 02:12:37,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1382
02:12:40,602 --> 02:12:45,826
[SPEAKER_08]: If there was notification about last night's meeting, there were like 24 people on Zoom.

1383
02:12:45,966 --> 02:12:51,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's not at all anything like the people that are gonna be affected by this.

1384
02:12:52,251 --> 02:12:55,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we all have to spread the word in our communities.

1385
02:12:57,115 --> 02:12:59,497
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unfortunate, but I think we have to.

1386
02:13:00,057 --> 02:13:06,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would just say at the beginning of every meeting, if you can have a rundown, I know that you've got it on the timeline and stuff like that,

1387
02:13:07,441 --> 02:13:12,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Following on the timeline, even when I look at it myself, and I try to go, okay, who is this?

1388
02:13:12,922 --> 02:13:14,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And black is this other thing.

1389
02:13:15,263 --> 02:13:25,285
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could just list them, just list that this date in chronological order of the dates coming up are May 21st is whatever it's.

1390
02:13:28,358 --> 02:13:37,925
[SPEAKER_08]: So differentiate between the community development board meetings, the planning and permitting committee meetings, the city council meetings, and just say what the dates that you expect.

1391
02:13:37,945 --> 02:13:45,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that sometimes they change because this CDB doesn't get through what they thought they were going to get through.

1392
02:13:45,731 --> 02:13:48,853
[SPEAKER_08]: So they bump it out again, and this goes on forever.

1393
02:13:48,953 --> 02:13:52,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And people like me are tearing their spinning hair out.

1394
02:14:03,730 --> 02:14:08,272
[SPEAKER_20]: We've really been trying to iterate through this process and make it better.

1395
02:14:08,292 --> 02:14:14,716
[SPEAKER_20]: I personally feel like we're in a much better position than we were a year ago in terms of getting the word out.

1396
02:14:15,856 --> 02:14:18,818
[SPEAKER_20]: It is basically really been coordinating that effort.

1397
02:14:19,299 --> 02:14:27,365
[SPEAKER_20]: Something I think we can try to maybe do instead of the timeline this way is her top, like, have it be each topic and we go over to the beginning of each meeting.

1398
02:14:27,385 --> 02:14:28,886
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can say residential districts.

1399
02:14:29,426 --> 02:14:31,088
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's upcoming for residential districts.

1400
02:14:32,589 --> 02:14:35,813
[SPEAKER_20]: Square by square, ADU, here's upcoming, and then it's not all mixed together.

1401
02:14:35,833 --> 02:14:38,375
[SPEAKER_20]: And that might be easier to read.

1402
02:14:38,415 --> 02:14:42,360
[SPEAKER_20]: That might be a different way to format the schedule so that people can know what topic is coming up.

1403
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:44,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Chronological order really works for dates.

1404
02:14:44,522 --> 02:14:49,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Chronological order by topic might also then spread it, like not have it all.

1405
02:14:49,814 --> 02:14:51,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Layered on top of each other.

1406
02:14:51,236 --> 02:14:52,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say we're trying real hard.

1407
02:14:52,878 --> 02:14:58,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So kit has been working very directly with our communication staff to keep this web page updated.

1408
02:14:59,645 --> 02:15:02,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so it's, but it is hard, right?

1409
02:15:02,408 --> 02:15:06,753
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, last night, the community development board met on May 7.

1410
02:15:07,914 --> 02:15:10,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't vote, so they continue to May 21st.

1411
02:15:10,935 --> 02:15:15,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, as of this morning, know that there's going to be, the next meeting is May 21st.

1412
02:15:15,775 --> 02:15:17,476
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't actually know that yesterday.

1413
02:15:18,696 --> 02:15:25,397
[SPEAKER_02]: We could have guessed, maybe, but do you really want us to post, I mean, we could put like tentative, like this is out of control.

1414
02:15:25,617 --> 02:15:34,919
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that particular thing, since you're bringing it up, it said May 7th at the top of the page, but down under neighborhood and whatever it is.

1415
02:15:34,939 --> 02:15:35,859
[SPEAKER_22]: That was something that I missed.

1416
02:15:36,834 --> 02:15:55,065
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah but i mean i'm just saying it's hard it's it it's hard for people to keep track of so if at the beginning of every meeting you could just put the upcoming like next week or something um in chronological order what kind of meeting it is and on the date

1417
02:15:55,643 --> 02:16:02,029
[SPEAKER_08]: it would be at least give us a heads up that you've got to watch your calendar for that.

1418
02:16:02,509 --> 02:16:04,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not blaming anybody.

1419
02:16:04,091 --> 02:16:06,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's really hard.

1420
02:16:06,833 --> 02:16:09,415
[SPEAKER_08]: It's obvious reminding people and I appreciate it.

1421
02:16:09,435 --> 02:16:12,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Did someone say why this can't be robocalls?

1422
02:16:12,979 --> 02:16:14,380
[SPEAKER_13]: We get robocalls on the streets.

1423
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:19,765
[SPEAKER_20]: We've asked the mayor's office and when we say the communication stuff,

1424
02:16:20,105 --> 02:16:30,230
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to be the mayor's communication staff because we don't always get to communicate what the council would like to communicate through them and we do not have communication staff.

1425
02:16:30,950 --> 02:16:34,632
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, so we have been asking them to include this in more of the communications.

1426
02:16:35,453 --> 02:16:36,853
[SPEAKER_20]: They have included them in more of the communications.

1427
02:16:36,873 --> 02:16:38,474
[SPEAKER_20]: We've been working collaboratively with them.

1428
02:16:42,145 --> 02:16:47,508
[SPEAKER_20]: They won't have more just that part of the problem.

1429
02:16:47,728 --> 02:16:50,549
[SPEAKER_20]: So, like, the mayor's newsletter goes out every 2 weeks.

1430
02:16:50,669 --> 02:16:52,710
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's included in the thing that goes out every 2 weeks.

1431
02:16:53,311 --> 02:16:57,453
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think we've asked for, can you send out communication specifically about this project?

1432
02:16:57,513 --> 02:16:57,953
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's.

1433
02:16:57,953 --> 02:17:00,355
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just that we're going to include it in the things we already send out.

1434
02:17:00,975 --> 02:17:02,496
[SPEAKER_20]: And that may be a communication strategy.

1435
02:17:02,516 --> 02:17:05,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe it goes down in readership the more things they send or something.

1436
02:17:05,458 --> 02:17:07,099
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what they're trying to balance there.

1437
02:17:07,519 --> 02:17:12,203
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't mean to say that they're just not listening to us, but that's been kind of the response.

1438
02:17:24,113 --> 02:17:27,836
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will just make it clear that please look at the wider news.

1439
02:17:28,256 --> 02:17:30,398
[SPEAKER_02]: The rat issue is not a Medford problem.

1440
02:17:30,878 --> 02:17:32,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a New England problem.

1441
02:17:33,681 --> 02:17:35,242
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a New England problem.

1442
02:17:35,642 --> 02:17:42,908
[SPEAKER_02]: But part of what helps is when there's, so what doesn't help is older rundown buildings that are half abandoned.

1443
02:17:43,308 --> 02:17:45,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are havens for rats.

1444
02:17:45,590 --> 02:18:00,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally had somebody say to me recently that they were very upset because they heard that the property next door to them that was run down and had run down garages and abandoned stuff on it was going was slated to be redeveloped.

1445
02:18:00,081 --> 02:18:01,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you that it's not permitted.

1446
02:18:01,882 --> 02:18:02,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not nothing.

1447
02:18:02,663 --> 02:18:04,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a developer was looking at doing it.

1448
02:18:04,745 --> 02:18:08,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was afraid that when it was redeveloped, all the rats would run on her property.

1449
02:18:08,667 --> 02:18:13,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reality is the rats are living in those run down spaces.

1450
02:18:13,651 --> 02:18:19,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, the moment the shovel hits on the ground, and while they're living there, they're going on everybody else's property.

1451
02:18:19,577 --> 02:18:21,960
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't respect property boundaries.

1452
02:18:22,721 --> 02:18:26,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And the minute the shovel hits the ground, yes, they'll get a little stirred up and there'll be some activity.

1453
02:18:27,125 --> 02:18:35,174
[SPEAKER_02]: But once it's a nice, new, clean, well-maintained by somebody who cares about that property, there will no longer be a home for the rats on that property.

1454
02:18:35,774 --> 02:18:37,214
[SPEAKER_20]: I just, I just want to add.

1455
02:18:37,615 --> 02:18:37,955
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

1456
02:18:37,975 --> 02:18:49,498
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a beautifully maintained landscape property and I have the lovely advocacy network for paying, helping get that company out twice, but they're still around.

1457
02:18:49,738 --> 02:18:51,918
[SPEAKER_11]: There's still so much we can do.

1458
02:18:51,998 --> 02:18:56,020
[SPEAKER_20]: We are working, the Board of Health, the Health Director, you had Yankee passed out.

1459
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:56,580
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1460
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,520
[SPEAKER_20]: We're working on that.

1461
02:18:58,140 --> 02:19:03,802
[SPEAKER_20]: We passed a new rodent control ordinance three years ago that's now started to build up through fees.

1462
02:19:04,382 --> 02:19:05,242
[SPEAKER_20]: Some more funds to

1463
02:19:05,242 --> 02:19:07,703
[SPEAKER_20]: to help in addition to what the city budgets were.

1464
02:19:07,763 --> 02:19:12,125
[SPEAKER_20]: We had the health budget on Tuesday, health budget on Tuesday.

1465
02:19:12,145 --> 02:19:17,026
[SPEAKER_20]: We were talking to the health director about this and we want to further amend the ordinance.

1466
02:19:17,046 --> 02:19:19,047
[SPEAKER_20]: There's an issue with the fine structure for the ordinance.

1467
02:19:19,067 --> 02:19:23,469
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to make an amendment to it to start finding problem properties as well, which we think will help more.

1468
02:19:23,909 --> 02:19:33,913
[SPEAKER_20]: And another piece of that ordinance that went into effect that the health director has been working along is requiring integrated pest management plans for developments over a certain size.

1469
02:19:34,893 --> 02:19:42,338
[SPEAKER_20]: The new Davis on building companies project on Felsway, for example, there's a ton of information that went out they just started.

1470
02:19:42,818 --> 02:19:49,302
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's a ton of information about their integrated pest management plan and how that project specifically is going to mitigate rodents.

1471
02:19:50,182 --> 02:20:14,718
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not to say that Alicia's not you know there is a climate and regional issue with rats and you know but trying to address the problem properties trying to get people to not overfill the trash cans having the integrated pest management plans for these projects um and hopefully through fees and fine timing more resources for yankee pests to help out on more properties is generally the city's approach um but hopefully with the development some of these things are

1472
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:33,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yeah, they're absolutely what I just said especially is required for new for every new development Every build right they need to have integrated pest management plans Every project like the health department signs off on every building permit.

1473
02:20:34,066 --> 02:20:35,866
[SPEAKER_02]: They're constant like I sign them too.

1474
02:20:35,926 --> 02:20:41,148
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sometimes I pay attention and see the health department sends every one of them rules.

1475
02:20:41,668 --> 02:20:45,630
[SPEAKER_02]: It's they have to submit plans and and then we always

1476
02:20:46,650 --> 02:21:06,245
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, we try to also talk more about this than I could part of the news trash contract and part of the new solid waste ordinance we passed is trying to a and the practice where we have open trash in the squares, which has been a huge issue for a long time, but also much more strict requirements on dumpsters and ballers.

1477
02:21:06,825 --> 02:21:08,387
[SPEAKER_20]: for private businesses.

1478
02:21:08,447 --> 02:21:11,830
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's another way that we're trying to go after this problem.

1479
02:21:11,870 --> 02:21:20,960
[SPEAKER_20]: So the DPW Health Planning Council Mayor, we are super aware of the rat problem and we're trying to hit it from every angle.

1480
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:25,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And I may actually even just add one of the things that is a problem

1481
02:21:26,225 --> 02:21:28,226
[SPEAKER_02]: can be is the backyard composting.

1482
02:21:28,506 --> 02:21:35,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of why we're providing the paid, the new composting program.

1483
02:21:35,528 --> 02:21:43,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And we encourage people because those are locked bins that are harder for the rats and the raccoons to get into than the regular garbage cans.

1484
02:21:43,610 --> 02:21:47,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So I strongly urge you to, it's free for everybody.

1485
02:21:48,093 --> 02:21:49,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody can sign up.

1486
02:21:49,674 --> 02:21:55,819
[SPEAKER_02]: We would like everybody to sign up, encourage people to do the composting where we pick it up for you.

1487
02:21:56,199 --> 02:21:59,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus you can put a lot more in them than you can, right?

1488
02:21:59,561 --> 02:22:03,684
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put all your grease in your bones and your cooked foods and stuff.

1489
02:22:03,784 --> 02:22:04,505
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice.

1490
02:22:04,805 --> 02:22:05,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Paper towels.

1491
02:22:05,786 --> 02:22:08,148
[SPEAKER_20]: I will say if we don't have another question, this might be a good...

1492
02:22:09,008 --> 02:22:10,070
[SPEAKER_20]: uh wrapping up it's 9 20.

1493
02:22:10,170 --> 02:22:15,116
[SPEAKER_04]: The question that comes to mind though is how do you look at all that

1494
02:22:27,214 --> 02:22:29,676
[SPEAKER_04]: and begin to see a theme on a particular topic.

1495
02:22:30,216 --> 02:22:38,281
[SPEAKER_04]: They've reached a certain critical mass on whether it's single family housing, height in a particular neighborhood.

1496
02:22:38,961 --> 02:22:43,144
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you accumulate the mass information you're getting?

1497
02:22:43,504 --> 02:22:46,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just not, oh, I'm just responding.

1498
02:22:46,826 --> 02:22:54,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually being interpreted so you know, this is the real issue in the city and the council needs to understand it.

1499
02:22:54,030 --> 02:22:55,471
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you do that?

1500
02:22:56,480 --> 02:23:03,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what they train us for as planners in planning school, is how do you take all of this in and start to process it?

1501
02:23:03,524 --> 02:23:06,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just heard you say you can't deal with all of it.

1502
02:23:06,346 --> 02:23:08,027
[SPEAKER_02]: You get overwhelmed.

1503
02:23:08,468 --> 02:23:11,870
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't respond to every individual message.

1504
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:19,895
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't hit reply on every, if we spent time answering every individual small message or long message,

1505
02:23:20,738 --> 02:23:23,341
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that is you just don't have the time.

1506
02:23:23,401 --> 02:23:26,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we don't have the time to sit there and look at the big picture.

1507
02:23:26,705 --> 02:23:33,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And 1 of the things that's come up is this whole, we got pull your request for the studies that did.

1508
02:23:33,273 --> 02:23:34,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you don't understand.

1509
02:23:35,035 --> 02:23:36,117
[SPEAKER_02]: She studies it.

1510
02:23:36,617 --> 02:23:39,078
[SPEAKER_02]: She puts different dimensions up on her screen.

1511
02:23:39,178 --> 02:23:40,979
[SPEAKER_02]: She puts different blocks together.

1512
02:23:41,059 --> 02:23:41,959
[SPEAKER_02]: She looks at these.

1513
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:43,260
[SPEAKER_02]: She does measurements.

1514
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:45,201
[SPEAKER_02]: She studies it.

1515
02:23:45,561 --> 02:23:48,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she says, OK, I see what works here, but doesn't.

1516
02:23:48,042 --> 02:23:49,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry if I'm speaking for you.

1517
02:23:49,523 --> 02:23:49,843
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

1518
02:23:49,903 --> 02:23:56,826
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of like she doesn't then write a report that we can then share with somebody.

1519
02:23:57,166 --> 02:23:59,187
[SPEAKER_02]: She says, I looked at all of this.

1520
02:23:59,267 --> 02:24:05,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I processed it with her background and her training and her knowledge, this is what I now recommend at this location.

1521
02:24:06,264 --> 02:24:13,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is literally what we're paying her and Emily and their other staff to be doing.

1522
02:24:13,448 --> 02:24:18,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy did to be doing some of this, the mapping analysis of it and overlay.

1523
02:24:19,065 --> 02:24:33,949
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are in any way good with maps or like maps, looking at Jimmy's tool online, the various layers that you can turn on, the setbacks, and the size of the lots, and the slopes, and so much goes into this.

1524
02:24:34,509 --> 02:24:37,429
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we pay them to spend all day, every day looking at.

1525
02:24:37,729 --> 02:24:42,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you spend your full-time Medford for the past couple of months, haven't you been?

1526
02:24:44,747 --> 02:24:53,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not only a matter, but it's a substantial amount of my time in this project that is very much time consuming.

1527
02:24:55,457 --> 02:24:56,759
[SPEAKER_05]: We looked at, for example,

1528
02:24:57,910 --> 02:25:01,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we have the analysis for the dimensions.

1529
02:25:01,533 --> 02:25:07,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So where are the current state in the lot dimensions in the frontage, uh, on the setbacks.

1530
02:25:07,757 --> 02:25:19,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we make an analysis of how can we make it conforming for as much as possible for what is there and existing, but at the same time that is feasible, that is possible.

1531
02:25:19,466 --> 02:25:26,811
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do some analysis of the lots and how many for those minimum dimensions and, and, and requirements.

1532
02:25:27,582 --> 02:25:33,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all comes out of our response to what the community wants.

1533
02:25:33,984 --> 02:25:41,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the mechanics of how we actually deliver something that's successful.

1534
02:25:41,867 --> 02:25:44,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So we also have the METFOR comprehensive plan.

1535
02:25:45,108 --> 02:25:50,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is the, we will say, where we come from, where we start from.

1536
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:54,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So we see those principles that are in that plan, which was done

1537
02:25:56,110 --> 02:26:22,065
[SPEAKER_05]: two years ago and it had plenty of community participation so we start from those what are the goals and the principles of the city ones right and the community ones from there we start to we did this in the very beginning this big analysis of all the lots of the conformities non-conformities what is there in the existing zoning and what is what you actually have

1538
02:26:23,386 --> 02:26:44,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we try to you see what is there so a little bit of that past the present and then the trends for the future So it's not engineering that you do put in the computer in a program and then it gives you yes or no It is really looking at a lot of variables that you need to put on and back We do a lot of back and forth.

1539
02:26:44,397 --> 02:26:45,478
[SPEAKER_05]: We come to the community.

1540
02:26:45,518 --> 02:26:52,842
[SPEAKER_05]: We present for the city staff the planning and permitting So there is a lot of back and forth I don't know the I don't live here

1541
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:54,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Jimmy does.

1542
02:26:54,681 --> 02:26:55,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't live here.

1543
02:26:55,902 --> 02:27:00,425
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know exactly the full reality of the problems that this community face, right?

1544
02:27:00,786 --> 02:27:06,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So the city staff will tell us what are those problems.

1545
02:27:07,451 --> 02:27:14,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Sal, for example, the director of economical development, he will tell us the problems that he's facing.

1546
02:27:14,156 --> 02:27:15,978
[SPEAKER_05]: The building commissioner, what are the issues?

1547
02:27:16,818 --> 02:27:21,182
[SPEAKER_05]: The city councillors, what the community tells them.

1548
02:27:21,602 --> 02:27:29,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we meet once a week to talk about the next steps and the projects and what we are presenting.

1549
02:27:29,688 --> 02:27:32,049
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we go to the planning and permitting committee meeting.

1550
02:27:32,169 --> 02:27:36,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there, the other councillors tell us, the public, we hear all the public.

1551
02:27:37,133 --> 02:27:40,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually, the comments are on the same thread.

1552
02:27:40,215 --> 02:27:43,637
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have two types of comments, or too dense or too little.

1553
02:27:44,077 --> 02:27:50,502
[SPEAKER_05]: So we try to see what is feasible in all of the studies that we have done and to look at,

1554
02:27:51,082 --> 02:27:52,722
[SPEAKER_05]: You can give me new perspectives.

1555
02:27:52,762 --> 02:27:58,064
[SPEAKER_05]: You can give me new reasons that we didn't take into account or a lot of people is feeling this way.

1556
02:27:58,544 --> 02:28:00,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we bring new recommendations.

1557
02:28:01,404 --> 02:28:08,866
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is the process of a lot of back and forth and trying to, we listen to everyone and then we see what is really possible and what is not.

1558
02:28:11,107 --> 02:28:14,848
[SPEAKER_02]: We really should wrap up because they really are going to kick us out.

1559
02:28:16,128 --> 02:28:16,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
