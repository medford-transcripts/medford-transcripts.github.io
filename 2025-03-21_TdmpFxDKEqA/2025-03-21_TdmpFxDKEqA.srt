you

16
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:38,412
Well, a couple of people moved.

17
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:40,374
We're trying to find new places.

18
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:45,277
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking the keys to these pieces.

19
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:50,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that all of our members are fourth and fifth graders of our school.

20
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:55,169
This is the third year that we've had a half-time school chair.

21
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:57,970
I learned a lot from him.

22
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:07,213
I just want to make sure he doesn't stand over here.

23
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:12,215
The next piece we're going to play

24
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:18,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play a little bit of T-Syre.

25
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,052
Oh.

26
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:24,602
Oh.

27
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:47,787

29
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:55,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Connor and members of the Handbell Choir, before you leave, I just really want to thank you for coming here tonight.

30
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:00,170
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's kind of a long and hectic day, and when we come to a meeting, you never know what to expect.

31
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,811
[SPEAKER_08]: So to begin our program, our meeting tonight, with such a lovely program from you is really exceptional, and I'm so grateful.

32
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:13,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Connor, as you know, I've had the chance to hear your Handbell Choir before, and I was so impressed then.

33
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:17,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the thing that really strikes me more than anything is that

34
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:27,484
[SPEAKER_08]: With you taking this initiative to try something new at your school, not only are you teaching the kids a lot about music, but what really stands out with this particular activity is the teamwork.

35
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:30,688
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm very grateful to you, and thank you for the kids.

36
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:32,149
[SPEAKER_08]: You did a fantastic job.

37
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And hats off to those two recorder players as well.

00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:37,155

39
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:37,896

[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say thank you for coming and to all the parents for putting your best foot forward.

42
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts our meeting in a very calm way.

43
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:59,505

00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:07,109
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really am very grateful for the peace that you brought to us in the art that you all take seriously.

45
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

46
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,231

[SPEAKER_16]: It gives the kids a really sense of pride and I love to see that and I love to see the pride in the face of the parents.

54
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:38,495
[SPEAKER_16]: In my personal note, my babies are graduating this year, and everybody used to say, you know, it flies, and remember this, even though there was days I wanted to pull my hair out of my head.

55
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:40,677

[SPEAKER_10]: They get hooked into the robots and get very excited about it.

158
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to revert back to the regular order of business?

159
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:43,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Ms.

160
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Vandercliff, seconded by Ms.

161
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:45,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Discari.

162
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:46,453
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

163
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:47,774
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

164
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:49,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Community participation.

165
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:51,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Melanie Perkins McLaughlin, CPAC report.

166
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we need to turn this on?

167
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:57,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

168
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:57,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

169
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

170
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, school committee members, Mr. Superintendent.

171
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having us here tonight.

172
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,064
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great to see the robotics club and the chimes.

173
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:08,825
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very relaxing.

174
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:17,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Melanie Perkins McLaughlin and I am the co-chair of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

175
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a PowerPoint presentation we're going to share with you, but first we want to share, well actually no, we can start it.

176
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:35,450
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here as representatives of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council and every year we give a community partnership award.

177
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year's community partnership award

178
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,841
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always for promoting the acceptance and inclusion of people of all abilities in the community and beyond.

179
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:55,083
[SPEAKER_01]: This year's award is going to Lawrence Memorial Hospital, who have been working in a partnership with Medford High School for the past 15 years and the Special Education Department.

180
00:17:55,703 --> 00:18:08,245
[SPEAKER_01]: The hospital's volunteer program, coordinated by Tracy Murray, has provided ongoing opportunities for Medford High School students of all abilities to contribute to their community while developing and practicing skills beyond the school environment.

181
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:20,217
[SPEAKER_01]: As volunteers, students interact with supervisors and learn specific skills, such as following safety protocols, waiting on customers in the cafeteria, and organizing materials in the central supply room.

182
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:25,338
[SPEAKER_01]: These students also learn to manage their time, follow a schedule, and travel independently.

183
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:34,840
[SPEAKER_01]: In just this past school year, Medford High School students and the Postgraduate Transition Program have provided over 85 volunteer hours to the Lawrence Memorial community.

184
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:48,062
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to ask the Lawrence Memorial Hospital community and a few students that were kind enough to come here tonight with them to come up please and receive your award from the Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

185
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:48,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Please come on up.

186
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:07,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you guys like to hold the award and go up in the air and take a picture?

187
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:13,800
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do it in the middle with all the school committee members.

188
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

189
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:16,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Not coming on?

190
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:18,199
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

191
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really really looking for it.

192
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,880
Yeah, the power's off.

193
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,800
Oh, there it goes.

194
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,341
Yeah.

195
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:27,401
We're good?

196
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:28,381
I think so.

197
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,022
You have it on, didn't you?

198
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:31,982
Yeah, the power's on.

199
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,223
Maybe you just need to warm it up.

200
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:35,403
Yeah.

201
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:43,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here it comes.

202
00:21:47,913 --> 00:21:52,377
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to do a short presentation, a PowerPoint presentation.

203
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:59,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Could John maybe adjust a little bit instead of me coming on the other side?

204
00:21:59,524 --> 00:22:01,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Mia, do you want to do it?

205
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:04,869
[SPEAKER_01]: It just needs to be centered and the focus needs to be taken care of.

206
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:05,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

207
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:15,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to do a brief PowerPoint presentation, just sort of letting folks know what the Special Education Parent Advisory Council does and what we've accomplished in the past year.

208
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,816
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to acknowledge some of our families that are here tonight and thank them for coming.

209
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:26,522
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you know, this is a cartoon I wanted to share with folks.

210
00:22:27,423 --> 00:22:33,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Henderson, former principal of the Henderson Public Schools and the Inclusion School, always shares this with his

211
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,021
[SPEAKER_01]: when he does his speeches.

212
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just a great example of how we can all work together.

213
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:45,147
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks who might not be able to see it, it's a ramp, a handicap ramp and stairs, and they're all filled with snow.

214
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:49,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a student in a wheelchair asking if the ramp can be cleared.

215
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:52,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And the person shoveling the steps is saying, just a minute.

216
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:53,971
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm done, I'll get to that.

217
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:57,653
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone says, well, if you do the ramp, we can all get up.

218
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:03,256
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a really good example, I think, of how, if we work together, we can all achieve.

219
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:21,253
[SPEAKER_01]: So our CPAC mission, the CPAC's purpose is to fulfill the directive of Chapter 71B of the Massachusetts General Law, which requires school districts to have a PAC and assign both advisory and participatory function to the PAC.

220
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:31,735
[SPEAKER_01]: So our mission is to advise the districts on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with disabilities by seeking input from the special education parent members and self-advocates.

221
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:38,956
[SPEAKER_01]: We meet regularly with school officials, and we participate in the planning, development, and evaluation of the school's special education program.

222
00:23:39,657 --> 00:23:41,858
[SPEAKER_01]: We also participate in planning workshops and activities.

223
00:23:42,238 --> 00:23:52,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure if I introduced myself because of the award for the Lawrence Memorial Community Partnership Award, but I am the co-chair of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

224
00:23:55,085 --> 00:24:00,968
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, for students with disabilities, the Medford Public Schools has 18% of students are students with disabilities.

225
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:08,271
[SPEAKER_01]: So that equals about one in five, and there are approximately 800 families in Medford that have students with disabilities.

226
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:24,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Our authority comes from the law that is required for school districts to have a PAC, and again, our mission is that we revise the school committee on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with disabilities, and we meet regularly with school officials.

227
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:30,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Joan Boehm, Kathy Madaglio is the Director of Pupil Services,

228
00:24:30,974 --> 00:24:33,415
[SPEAKER_01]: was going to present with me tonight, and unfortunately, she's ill.

229
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:38,057
[SPEAKER_01]: So Joan Bowen, the coordinator of secondary special education, is here.

230
00:24:38,337 --> 00:24:39,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Joan, for coming tonight.

231
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:42,318
[SPEAKER_01]: And is here to answer any questions as well, if we have any.

232
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:42,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, Joan?

233
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:44,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

234
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:45,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

235
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:49,421
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are some of our accomplishments.

236
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:53,583
[SPEAKER_01]: What we normally do is we meet the second Wednesday of every month from 7 to 9.

237
00:24:53,963 --> 00:24:58,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul DeLeva at the Andrews Middle School is kind enough to allow us to use his school every month.

238
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:08,351
[SPEAKER_01]: We meet there and we host workshops or sometimes we host socials and we learn from our community what kind of workshops they want, they require.

239
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:20,635
[SPEAKER_01]: We are required annually to have a basic rights workshop, basic rights in special education, and that is a collaboration with the Federation for Children with Special Needs and the Medford CPAC and the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

240
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:24,176
[SPEAKER_01]: This year we also did the special education mediation process.

241
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:31,155
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is from a mediator from the Bureau of Special Education Appeals, Merto Flesas is a Medford mediator.

242
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:36,037
[SPEAKER_01]: We did agreeing to disagree with attorney Dan Heffernan of Cote and Crabtree and Strong.

243
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:37,618
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a great night.

244
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:38,898
[SPEAKER_01]: We did meet the school committee.

245
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:40,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks here might remember that.

246
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:52,603
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really nice, and it was a nice dialogue between the school committee and families and guardians and students of children with special needs and students with disabilities, and we were able to share what some of our needs are.

247
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,740
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're able to get some great feedback.

248
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:11,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's Get Organized was recent, and that's a workshop that actually had really good feedback, too, and we had a lot of folks from the special education department come out and help families get organized with their IEPs and their paperwork and all the 504 material, all the paperwork that can be overwhelming sometimes.

249
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:22,001
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had one on homework anxiety, and that was actually presented by two Medford Public Schools staff members, Angela Lepore and Lauren Kwiatkowski.

250
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:23,122
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I pronounced her name right.

251
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:24,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was actually really great.

252
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:36,930
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some hands-on material building between the special education department and the CPAC and parents and we were able to build some tools and talk about anxiety and it was a really helpful session as well.

253
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:42,153
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always welcome to ideas and for professional development as well.

254
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:50,337
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are teachers or school committee members or special educators or general educators out there that would like a particular workshop, please let us know and we'll see what we can do.

255
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:56,184
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have monthly meetings with the Director of Special Education.

256
00:26:56,924 --> 00:26:59,886
[SPEAKER_01]: We advise parents and guardians on the special education process.

257
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,908
[SPEAKER_01]: We go to meetings with the Disability Council and the Human Rights Council.

258
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:11,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And we go to conferences around the state, Mass Down Syndrome Conference, Federation for Children with Special Needs.

259
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:17,596
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great educators conference that happens every October for general educators and special educators in Worcester.

260
00:27:18,476 --> 00:27:20,137
[SPEAKER_01]: We attend a parent leadership series.

261
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,829
[SPEAKER_01]: and school committee meetings.

262
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,332
[SPEAKER_01]: We offer resources to families, and we also can help with conflict resolution.

263
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:35,574
[SPEAKER_01]: We do some public relations and media outreach, and we do public speaking if necessary.

264
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:39,656
[SPEAKER_01]: We interact with Program Quality Assurance and the Office of Civil Rights.

265
00:27:39,696 --> 00:27:44,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the places folks go to if they have an issue that hasn't been able to be resolved within the district.

266
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:49,641
[SPEAKER_01]: We meet with state legislators regarding issues concerning students with disabilities.

267
00:27:50,888 --> 00:27:52,509
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Gracie on the State House there.

268
00:27:52,989 --> 00:28:10,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year we had, a couple years ago, we had the governor sign some litigation, I mean some, sorry, not litigation, some legislation, thank you, on Down syndrome and providing updated diagnosis for individuals with Down syndrome.

269
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,942
[SPEAKER_01]: But we go to the State House pretty much every year, if it's not with the Parent Leadership Series, with the CPAC.

270
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:19,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year we're hoping to have an event at the State House that we hope you guys will join us at, where we talk a little bit about

271
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:23,836
[SPEAKER_01]: what different districts can need, and we hope to collaborate with folks across Massachusetts.

272
00:28:24,597 --> 00:28:32,245
[SPEAKER_01]: We attend IEP meetings as needed, public hearing meetings as needed, and we facilitate and attend IEP or 504 meetings as needed.

273
00:28:32,785 --> 00:28:34,106
[SPEAKER_01]: And we attend MassPAC meetings.

274
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:39,392
[SPEAKER_01]: MassPAC is the Massachusetts Parent Advisory Council through the Federation for Children with Special Needs.

275
00:28:41,642 --> 00:28:50,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Our CPAC members have done things from present to the United Nations, to create employment programs for students with disabilities.

276
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:53,886
[SPEAKER_01]: We share our stories nationally and with legislators.

277
00:28:55,107 --> 00:29:00,068
[SPEAKER_01]: We've presented to the associations for special educators, have met with legislators, as we said.

278
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:09,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just had a member tonight telling us that she's going to be trained on Wednesday to be a surrogate special education parent, which is really exciting, and that is

279
00:29:10,785 --> 00:29:18,072
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be a surrogate through the Federation for Children with Special Needs for families of children who don't have representatives for their IEP.

280
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:22,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So for foster children or homeless children or folks who can't have supports there.

281
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,399
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a member that's starting to do that too.

282
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:25,380
[SPEAKER_01]: We're excited about that.

283
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:34,923
[SPEAKER_01]: CPAC members are immigrants, accountants, pediatricians, attorneys, stay-at-home parents, teachers, a little bit of everybody.

284
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:42,645
[SPEAKER_01]: We have children with varying diagnosis, no diagnosis, mild diagnosis, moderate, and significant disabilities.

285
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:47,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to talk to the school committee tonight.

286
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:56,467
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to sort of what we've done for the past year, we also want to talk about one of the things we've realized in the past is that we've talked a lot about what we do, but we haven't talked a lot about

287
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,900
[SPEAKER_01]: how we can collaborate with each other and what we can do moving forward.

288
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,541
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really a big purpose of this presentation.

289
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:07,704
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to talk about what's the state of special education in Medford right now and how do we work together.

290
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:22,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the special education data that's available on the Department of Education website, and you can see on the bottom there, and maybe we can have this

291
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:23,747
[SPEAKER_01]: share it on the website.

292
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:29,090
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a link that you can go to to look for data on your school district through the Department of Education.

293
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,651
[SPEAKER_01]: And for special education, they have indicators.

294
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:35,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So indicators one through, I think it's eight that we'll look at here.

295
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:43,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is sort of an idea of accountability ratings, but also how we're doing in terms of what the ratings are for special education.

296
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:46,477
[SPEAKER_01]: So indicator one is the graduation rate.

297
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:51,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And Medford is below state average for graduation rate, according

298
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:53,797
[SPEAKER_01]: to special education.

299
00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:57,079
[SPEAKER_01]: So the state average is 83.4%.

300
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:01,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is 83.4% and the state is 87.3%.

301
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Indicator two, dropout rate.

302
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:08,024
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a higher dropout rate than the state average by about 1%.

303
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:14,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Indicator three, participation and performance of students with IEPs on statewide assessments, MCAS.

304
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,428
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not meet the target.

305
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:20,850
[SPEAKER_01]: But on 3B and 3C, so on your PowerPoint,

306
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:27,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you folks to know that the bold is things that we need to work on, and the italics are things that we have met the target on.

307
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:31,296
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will help you decode when you're looking at it.

308
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:35,920
[SPEAKER_01]: The participation rate for students with IEPs on MCAS, we've matched the state rate on that.

309
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:40,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And the proficiency rate for students with IEPs on MCAS are also proficient.

310
00:31:40,604 --> 00:31:41,785
[SPEAKER_01]: We've matched the state rate on that.

311
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:47,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Indicator four, suspension and expulsion for students with IEPs.

312
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:56,307
[SPEAKER_01]: We're currently below the state rate, which is great, and we have improved significantly over time, if you look at the rate from five years ago and see the decrease.

313
00:31:56,987 --> 00:32:02,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Indicator five, educational environments for students age six to 21 with IEPs.

314
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:05,750
[SPEAKER_01]: So full inclusion, partial inclusion are substantially separate.

315
00:32:06,831 --> 00:32:12,192
[SPEAKER_01]: For full inclusion, we're below the state average, and we're below by, like, around 10%.

316
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:13,193
[SPEAKER_01]: For partial inclusion,

317
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:22,273
[SPEAKER_01]: We are above for partial inclusion, and we're also above for substantially separate.

318
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:31,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're slightly above for separate schools, residential facilities, or homebound hospital placements.

319
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:38,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Indicator six, educational environments for students age three to five with IEPs, we're above the state average for full inclusion.

320
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:41,878
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing something really well in preschool.

321
00:32:42,985 --> 00:32:45,826
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to see, as well as all the other things we're doing well here.

322
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,667
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's nice to see that in the preschool level.

323
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:52,668
[SPEAKER_01]: For early childhood outcomes and parent involvement, also all above state average.

324
00:32:53,509 --> 00:33:00,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Indicators nine through 14, we are all meeting the proficiency standard or above state average.

325
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:01,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are great.

326
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:12,055
[SPEAKER_01]: So disproportionality in special education, disproportionality in specific disability categories, initial evaluation timelines, early childhood transitions, secondary transitions,

327
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:14,633
[SPEAKER_01]: and post-school outcomes for students with IEPs.

328
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:21,537
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the special education data based on indicators that again is available on the Department of Education's website.

329
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:31,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we know, Medford Public Schools needs, so when we ask what is the state of special education in Medford, Medford Public Schools needs technical assistance.

330
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:41,749
[SPEAKER_01]: So the school is, the district is considered a level three, although we have one school that's a level three and a few that are level one and a few that are level two.

331
00:33:42,536 --> 00:33:47,859
[SPEAKER_01]: If one is labeled a level three, the Department of Education sees the district as level three.

332
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:54,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means we're seen as needing technical assistance from the State Department of Education.

333
00:33:57,683 --> 00:34:00,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And in summary, our special education data and concerns.

334
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:04,447
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a substantial achievement gap between typical students and high need students.

335
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:06,368
[SPEAKER_01]: We feel that that's a significant issue.

336
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:10,390
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't show a slide here tonight, and I'm happy to share it with the school committee if you want to.

337
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:15,653
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can see typical students in a bar graph aside, students with disabilities.

338
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:16,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's substantial.

339
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:17,674
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just here.

340
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:18,615
[SPEAKER_01]: It is across the state.

341
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,255
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a significant issue.

342
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:22,896
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the achievement gap that we have that we talk about often.

343
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Full inclusion rates are less than the state average.

344
00:34:25,957 --> 00:34:27,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Dropout rates are higher than the state average.

345
00:34:28,118 --> 00:34:30,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And substantially separate settings are higher than the state average.

346
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:31,919
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are our concerns.

347
00:34:31,979 --> 00:34:35,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to back up a little bit to talk about, you know, the things that are great that have happened.

348
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:39,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to make sure that we recognize things that have happened in the special education community

349
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:51,317
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been great, and there's a lot of indicators on there that have met proficiency, and I think that's because of a lot of hard work with Kathy Madaglio and Joan Bowen and our staff and the CPAC and the students.

350
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,359
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some things that we need to work on.

351
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So CPAC recommendations, we have some recommendations that we'd like to make to the school committee.

352
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:03,225
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the use of DSAC technical assistance accelerated improvement plan.

353
00:35:03,265 --> 00:35:08,168
[SPEAKER_01]: So DSAC is the Department of Education's when a district needs improvement, there's a group

354
00:35:11,466 --> 00:35:15,028
[SPEAKER_01]: called DSAC, that will come to the district and help with some technical assistance.

355
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:20,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think using that and utilizing that, especially as it pertains to students with disabilities, would be really helpful.

356
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:23,493
[SPEAKER_01]: We think using that and utilizing that would be really helpful.

357
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:36,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Some professional development, especially around students with disabilities and general educators and special educators working together to understand the needs of students with disabilities and the typical population.

358
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:40,860
[SPEAKER_01]: professional development around differentiated instruction and universal design for learning.

359
00:35:41,361 --> 00:35:54,366
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks that are here, the school committee I'm sure knows, but maybe people in the audience or people watching tonight may not know that there's a new law that's been written that's replacing the No Child Left Behind Act called the Every Student Succeeds Act.

360
00:35:54,886 --> 00:36:00,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And written into ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act, is a requirement for universal design for learning.

361
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:05,570
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important that our school district understands universal design for learning and how to implement that.

362
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great tool for students with disabilities, for all students, I would say.

363
00:36:11,284 --> 00:36:13,765
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend co-teaching and collaborative teaching.

364
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:21,251
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an example recently where we were at a school council meeting, and they were talking about a school improvement plan.

365
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:26,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things they were talking about was sort of how to differentiate math instruction.

366
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the questions I had was, well, are you talking to your special educators?

367
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:34,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And the general educators and special educators working together seems like it makes a lot of sense.

368
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:46,688
[SPEAKER_01]: have been trained for a lot of differentiation, and I'm sure our general educators have as well, but the two of them collaborating together makes a much more powerful example, as we've seen from other schools across states.

369
00:36:47,268 --> 00:36:55,093
[SPEAKER_01]: And cultural competency, understanding students with disabilities and students with different needs is really important for all of us.

370
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:04,420
[SPEAKER_01]: More recommendations, we ask that the school committee, the Medford School Committee and the Medford Public Schools create

371
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:07,367
[SPEAKER_01]: and or endorse an inclusion subcommittee.

372
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:25,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So an inclusion subcommittee might consist of inclusion facilitators, experts, consultants, school committee members, CPAC members, where we could evaluate educational environments, inclusive schools, after schools, the summer camp program that we have in Medford, and the community school program.

373
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:28,073
[SPEAKER_01]: There are inclusion subcommittees around the state.

374
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:31,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Public Schools certainly created one a few years ago that was very helpful.

375
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:32,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you folks have

376
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:35,775
[SPEAKER_01]: subcommittees, is that what it's called here, too?

377
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:45,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we could have recommendations at the end, basically, as we talk to educators and parents across the district about what that could look like.

378
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:50,948
[SPEAKER_01]: We would ask that the Educator Guidebook for Inclusive Practice, which was sent

379
00:37:51,624 --> 00:37:59,230
[SPEAKER_01]: out by the Department of Education, I think it was last year, be used with general educators and special educators.

380
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:09,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Kathy wanted us to mention for sure that the administrative team in Medford has reviewed the power elements for inclusive practice on the educator guidebook for inclusive practice.

381
00:38:10,478 --> 00:38:15,502
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are seeking endorsement from the school committee in the district of this DESE advisory.

382
00:38:18,668 --> 00:38:20,850
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available online as well for folks that want to look for it.

383
00:38:22,811 --> 00:38:24,733
[SPEAKER_01]: So improve family and community engagement.

384
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:37,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Some suggestions we would have is, Superintendent Belson and I spoke about this a few months ago, and I think he agreed that it was a good idea as well, have coffee with the superintendent or school committee members.

385
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:45,988
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a couple of times a year where we could have coffee with parents of students with disabilities and self-advocates and talk about what our concerns are.

386
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:49,427
[SPEAKER_01]: offer an opportunity for online feedback.

387
00:38:49,467 --> 00:38:53,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was mentioned in the meeting we had for the Q&A.

388
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:58,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes parents can't get out, and if they could give online feedback, that would be really helpful.

389
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Automated calls for meeting information.

390
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:12,714
[SPEAKER_01]: So our Special Education Parent Advisory Council has all of these great workshops, and we have these workshops for families and guardians of children with special needs, but we also have them for the educational community, for the school committee members, for anybody that wants to come.

391
00:39:12,754 --> 00:39:14,374
[SPEAKER_01]: It's other interested parties as well.

392
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:28,971
[SPEAKER_01]: to come, but a lot of times they don't know about the meetings, even though they're on the district website and they're in the transcript typically or whatever, but we would recommend that a robocall once a month go out to the community, letting folks know what the workshops are.

393
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,713
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several workshops that pertain to students of all abilities.

394
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:41,942
[SPEAKER_01]: We already said meet with self-advocates, students with disability, consult with CPAC, publish CPAC meetings, especially workshops, and ask families to share their stories.

395
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:49,599
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we're finding really important as we meet each other and we share our community with each other is being able to share our stories and our children's stories.

396
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,821
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have families here who have JoJo.

397
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:53,622
[SPEAKER_01]: What grade is JoJo?

398
00:39:54,702 --> 00:39:54,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Sixth?

399
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:55,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Sixth grade.

400
00:39:56,543 --> 00:39:57,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And Quinton?

401
00:39:58,885 --> 00:39:59,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventh grade.

402
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:09,871
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we share our stories and are able to share information with folks about who we are and what our children are like and what they need and what they're great at and what they offer to the community, it brings us all closer.

403
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:10,832
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have a story.

404
00:40:11,765 --> 00:40:14,667
[SPEAKER_01]: not just students with disabilities or families of students with disabilities.

405
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:20,451
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have a story, and it's important that we share our stories with each other.

406
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:26,055
[SPEAKER_01]: We're asking that CPAC recommendations that the district implement a district-wide disability awareness program.

407
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:28,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited about understanding our differences.

408
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:30,678
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very excited about understanding our differences.

409
00:40:30,738 --> 00:40:40,145
[SPEAKER_01]: A Newton-based public schools disability awareness organization that I believe has about 40 years experience with disability awareness, the Brooks PTO,

410
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:46,907
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Brooks Elementary School has offered to host a pilot program of Understanding Our Differences.

411
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:52,834
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just trained with the 5th grade teachers a week ago on an autism unit.

412
00:40:53,695 --> 00:40:56,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So the great thing about Understanding Our Differences, it has 3rd, 4th and 5th grade

413
00:40:58,048 --> 00:41:09,736
[SPEAKER_01]: small hour and a half curriculum programs around autism, intellectual disability, physical disability, blindness, deafness, allergies, all kinds of programs.

414
00:41:09,796 --> 00:41:11,577
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great program and we highly recommend it.

415
00:41:11,957 --> 00:41:13,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're excited about that starting next year.

416
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:14,759
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you guys will come to that.

417
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,540
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be sure to invite you.

418
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:20,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Review grant information related to students with disabilities.

419
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:25,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Endorse and offer professional development for general ed and special ed collaboration.

420
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:27,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Include students with disabilities and families

421
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:32,369
[SPEAKER_01]: and families in policy and decision making and have transparency of information.

422
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,411
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the redirection of funds.

423
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:56,320
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talked earlier about grants and being able to share information on grants of students that are intended for students with disabilities, the Fund 240, which I'm sure the superintendent can talk much more about than I can, I'm not very familiar with the fund, but I know that on the Department of Education's website, especially regarding special education,

424
00:41:56,752 --> 00:42:00,993
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an advance notice of intent to direct the use of fund code 240.

425
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:18,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a district does need technical assistance, they have up to 1% and 5% of the district's total entitlement grant is redirected by DESE into areas that DESE and perhaps the DSAC and of course the superintendent and school committee find necessary.

426
00:42:18,718 --> 00:42:24,820
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say perhaps some of the things that we mentioned earlier in terms of recommendations might be potentially funded by some of these things.

427
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:29,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Differences are what makes us beautiful.

428
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:41,937
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love this quote from the Medford Public Schools Director of Pupil Services, because I think oftentimes people forget this, but she certainly doesn't, which we think is a great thing.

429
00:42:42,538 --> 00:42:44,779
[SPEAKER_01]: All students are general education students.

430
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Students with disability are general education students receiving special education support.

431
00:42:55,317 --> 00:42:58,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is the end of our presentation, our PowerPoint presentation.

432
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:02,201
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to take questions and answers if folks are interested.

433
00:43:10,345 --> 00:43:10,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

434
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:11,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

435
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Melanie, for your presentation.

436
00:43:14,288 --> 00:43:17,209
[SPEAKER_08]: You've given us a lot of information, so I'm trying to absorb it quickly.

437
00:43:17,229 --> 00:43:19,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm particularly excited.

438
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:23,653
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that hit me was the implement district-wide disability awareness program.

439
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:29,464
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, that makes so much sense in terms of students understanding their classmates.

440
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:34,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that early in my years on the school committee, I wanted to do something like that.

441
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it would be useful for kids to understand.

442
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:43,091
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the point in time, the big issue was everybody's confidentiality.

443
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:49,235
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we have a sea change of parents willing to

444
00:43:50,882 --> 00:43:55,463
[SPEAKER_08]: share their child's information about their child's disability with other students.

445
00:43:55,603 --> 00:43:57,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't think of anything that would be more positive.

446
00:43:58,343 --> 00:44:10,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the way that Understanding Our Differences program works, and we would invite you to observe one at Newton Public Schools, and certainly Kathy and I are going to go observe one before we have it in Medford next year.

447
00:44:10,806 --> 00:44:13,106
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't identify the students with disabilities.

448
00:44:13,306 --> 00:44:16,467
[SPEAKER_08]: But even in general, talking about a disability such as autism,

449
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:18,452
[SPEAKER_01]: of having children being aware.

450
00:44:18,472 --> 00:44:19,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, generally talking.

451
00:44:19,873 --> 00:44:24,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Parents and students are always able to opt out, of course, if they wanted to.

452
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:40,363
[SPEAKER_01]: But also we find that research has shown that when you do talk about things and you do share information, not necessarily about your diagnosis or your child's diagnosis, but you share information about compassion and differences in humanity, that people actually really come together.

453
00:44:41,647 --> 00:45:00,660
[SPEAKER_01]: What Jenny Acosta at Understanding Our Differences was sharing with our fifth grade teachers last week when we were doing the training on autism, because some of these questions did come up, was that it is so powerful to watch the students really come together and that so many times it's actually the adults that have the issues around coming together.

454
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I think you're right.

455
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:06,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to include parents of students with disabilities and parents of students without disabilities.

456
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:11,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a volunteer partnership that parents do as part of the Understanding Our Differences program.

457
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:18,730
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've also seen, you know, on TV stories about, you know, classrooms of kids who once they understood

458
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:25,081
[SPEAKER_08]: the disabilities of a child in their class, what a team they became with that child.

459
00:45:25,341 --> 00:45:26,362
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's wonderful.

460
00:45:26,622 --> 00:45:37,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, just to get to one question, on your indicators graduation rate, I just want to ask you whether you use the four-year graduation rate for Medford or the five-year graduation rate.

461
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:39,508
[SPEAKER_08]: We used whatever DESE had on their site.

462
00:45:39,908 --> 00:45:42,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think that there's a big difference for us between four-year

463
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:45,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, in five years.

464
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, interesting, yeah.

465
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:53,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and so students, if I recall correctly, I mean, it does take some students longer, but that doesn't mean that they're unsuccessful.

466
00:45:53,843 --> 00:46:05,227
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, it means they're very successful and they've stuck to it and really, and so when we look at that, I think it's a, that particular detail is important in our understanding overall.

467
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:06,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would agree.

468
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, of course.

469
00:46:07,468 --> 00:46:08,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to compare them.

470
00:46:08,508 --> 00:46:14,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I don't remember exactly, but I remember at some point looking at that and saying that was interesting.

471
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:27,787
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of your call for the DSAC technical assistance, I thought, are we already having a DSAC team come in, or where are we?

472
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:30,591
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could ask the superintendent.

473
00:46:30,611 --> 00:46:31,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

474
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:35,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've met with DSAC, and you know, we've worked with them before, and we'll continue to work with them.

475
00:46:35,673 --> 00:46:44,957
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, you know, different assistances they can provide at different times, and it really depends on, you know, what we identify as being most significant.

476
00:46:45,738 --> 00:46:53,542
[SPEAKER_00]: As Melanie points out, there's a set-aside in the IDA funds that, you know, will be moved into that area, and also DSAC has some funds.

477
00:46:53,622 --> 00:46:55,022
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll take a look at it.

478
00:46:55,543 --> 00:46:57,524
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that one of the things that

479
00:46:58,885 --> 00:47:12,335
[SPEAKER_00]: What we probably should do is, since Kathy can't be here tonight, and Kathy had some additional things she wanted to say, is why don't we schedule a session in the Committee of the Whole sometime before the year's out, and we can have a good give and take on where we're going.

480
00:47:13,212 --> 00:47:13,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

481
00:47:13,732 --> 00:47:21,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think, um, the other thing that the PAC called for was the endorse inclusion and endorse an inclusion subcommittee.

482
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:24,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that would also be a valuable thing to discuss that night.

483
00:47:24,815 --> 00:47:27,536
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree that that would be an appropriate follow-up.

484
00:47:27,576 --> 00:47:33,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll have a, you know, obviously there's a lot of things going on as, as Melanie points out, the early childhood rate is way up.

485
00:47:33,598 --> 00:47:38,139
[SPEAKER_00]: If you combine the partial with the full inclusion, the rate is that much more substantial.

486
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,040
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, how do we get it more full inclusion?

487
00:47:41,618 --> 00:47:49,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and like Kathy would say, if she were here I think, the partial inclusion rate can be anywhere from 79% to 21%.

488
00:47:50,064 --> 00:47:52,226
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big span.

489
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:52,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Big window.

490
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:53,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

491
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:55,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at that I think is important.

492
00:47:55,688 --> 00:47:59,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and the last thing I just had jotted down was robocalls.

493
00:48:00,572 --> 00:48:07,377
[SPEAKER_08]: It would seem that we ought to be able to include PAC meeting information in a robocall

494
00:48:08,348 --> 00:48:15,111
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it might be a standalone call or it might be something that other things are being announced at the same time.

495
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,592
[SPEAKER_08]: So I certainly think we ought to work on that.

496
00:48:18,592 --> 00:48:19,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

497
00:48:19,393 --> 00:48:20,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

498
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:21,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

499
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:22,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

500
00:48:22,908 --> 00:48:30,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know if all of you know this, but my day job is a special education coordinator at a charter school in Somerville in Cambridge.

501
00:48:31,272 --> 00:48:36,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really well aware of what parents can do together.

502
00:48:36,815 --> 00:48:40,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And at our school, we beg parents to come forward and do work like this.

503
00:48:40,557 --> 00:48:44,419
[SPEAKER_05]: This is exceptional work that you all should be very proud.

504
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:46,040
[SPEAKER_05]: This room should be filled though.

505
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,021
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's 800 families, this should be,

506
00:48:48,598 --> 00:48:50,439
[SPEAKER_05]: way more people here.

507
00:48:50,640 --> 00:49:00,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope it's because they're home with their children, reading books, and helping them with homework, and doing all those so many things, or they're just having a rough night, and that you're representative of them.

508
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:04,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the work that you're doing is phenomenal.

509
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,792
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get the word out to them as well.

510
00:49:08,213 --> 00:49:15,579
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know how that is, because I used to be vice co-chair of the PTO at the high school, and it would be the same ones doing the work.

511
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:16,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't get tired.

512
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't quit.

513
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep going.

514
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,800
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exceptional work.

515
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:21,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very impressed.

516
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:32,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also very happy to see the use of the technical assistance, the accelerated improvement plan in your visual, because I'm a visual learner.

517
00:49:33,964 --> 00:49:35,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's very helpful to me.

518
00:49:35,344 --> 00:49:47,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to ask the superintendent for some information on what we're currently doing and what we're working with them on to have prepared for that subcommittee meeting, so that way we know

519
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:51,543
[SPEAKER_05]: what areas exactly we're focused on.

520
00:49:51,603 --> 00:49:55,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making changes so our district is no longer a level three school district.

521
00:49:55,404 --> 00:49:57,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I've said it all year and I'm tired of saying it.

522
00:49:58,105 --> 00:49:58,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like it.

523
00:49:59,226 --> 00:50:00,586
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very upsetting to me.

524
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:03,587
[SPEAKER_05]: We do great work throughout our community.

525
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:06,068
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make sure we're educating every student.

526
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:09,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to thank you for the opportunity to come to some of your meetings.

527
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:10,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't make

528
00:50:10,996 --> 00:50:12,197
[SPEAKER_05]: as many as I would like to.

529
00:50:12,277 --> 00:50:16,021
[SPEAKER_05]: But the question and answer night, I really liked.

530
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:21,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to mingle amongst parents and really talk to them about different issues that have come up.

531
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:26,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know people by sight, even though I'm terrible with names.

532
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know some of their children now from going to those meetings.

533
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:33,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a connection that I need and I appreciate having.

534
00:50:33,876 --> 00:50:37,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see more of us work with you on those type of situations.

535
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:47,538
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is anything that this group needs from me, my door is open and welcome to comments or suggestions or if you need things brought forward.

536
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:54,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I am known as a big mouth here and I don't mind advocating for the parents and the students in the community.

537
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:58,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And since I work in this area, this is where I feel my expertise is.

538
00:50:59,226 --> 00:51:04,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So please feel free to come forward and thank you again for all your time, your dedication.

539
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you lead this group well.

540
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:09,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you work with our administrators well.

541
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:12,936
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to keep those doors open, and thank you again.

542
00:51:13,256 --> 00:51:13,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

543
00:51:15,077 --> 00:51:15,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

544
00:51:15,297 --> 00:51:18,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Cugno, thank you, Melanie, for bringing this to us.

545
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:24,302
[SPEAKER_16]: The way you set it up tonight through the PowerPoint, an excellent job to you and to everyone who worked on this.

546
00:51:25,342 --> 00:51:30,085
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a really wonderful way of going through everything and in the detail.

547
00:51:30,445 --> 00:51:33,687
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to take the time because I know everyone is extremely tired.

548
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:47,773
[SPEAKER_16]: to reiterate what my colleagues have said, but I am looking over a couple of things, and like, under the accomplishments, which I know that you have gone to a lot of the Attend Parent Leadership Series, is that something that other parents could go to?

549
00:51:47,893 --> 00:51:49,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it something that they pay for?

550
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:58,322
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, the Massachusetts Families Organizing for Change Parent Leadership Series is such a good program, and it is available to families for free.

551
00:51:59,027 --> 00:52:01,387
[SPEAKER_01]: families of students with disabilities, family members.

552
00:52:01,587 --> 00:52:06,008
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could be a sister, you could be a brother, you could be a parent, you could be any of those things.

553
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:08,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hosted overnight.

554
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:12,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a Friday and a Saturday once a month for three months.

555
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:15,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hotel and the food and everything is paid for.

556
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:18,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And it culminates in a visit to your state house.

557
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:22,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And you meet all your legislators and you talk with them about what your concerns are.

558
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:27,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have some recent Mass Families Organizing for Change Parent Leadership Series graduates here.

559
00:52:27,866 --> 00:52:29,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could tell you it's a fabulous program.

560
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:31,087
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's completely funded.

561
00:52:31,127 --> 00:52:32,028
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely free.

562
00:52:32,268 --> 00:52:34,569
[SPEAKER_16]: And how does a parent know about this?

563
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:38,111
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, is it because they come to your meetings, or do you send out a newsletter?

564
00:52:38,131 --> 00:52:40,151
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to push the information out as much as we can.

565
00:52:40,372 --> 00:52:43,053
[SPEAKER_01]: The applications are in January.

566
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:46,494
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the applications come, we put it on our Facebook page.

567
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:48,515
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to let families know.

568
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:50,296
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly let our CPAC members know.

569
00:52:50,356 --> 00:52:52,337
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be happy to share it with you folks for the constituents.

570
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:55,143
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a really good program because, again, it's free.

571
00:52:55,163 --> 00:52:58,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that they do ask is that you attend all four.

572
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:00,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Husband and wives can go together.

573
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:02,408
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really great.

574
00:53:02,968 --> 00:53:11,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a nice source of respite, too, for family members that they have child care stipends that they can give you if you need some child care money.

575
00:53:11,714 --> 00:53:12,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great program.

576
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:12,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is this?

577
00:53:13,656 --> 00:53:17,138
[SPEAKER_01]: They host it at Burlington, but the organization is called MFOFC.

578
00:53:19,942 --> 00:53:24,043
[SPEAKER_01]: So the acronym is for MassFamiliesOrganizingForChange.org.

579
00:53:24,943 --> 00:53:25,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have regional ones.

580
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:29,104
[SPEAKER_01]: So ours is the coordinators out of Melrose.

581
00:53:29,184 --> 00:53:33,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Lori Medeiros is one of the coordinators here in Medford as well.

582
00:53:33,285 --> 00:53:37,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And they host the session out of Burlington at the Burlington Marriott?

583
00:53:40,787 --> 00:53:41,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Woburn, Woburn.

584
00:53:41,587 --> 00:53:42,467
[SPEAKER_01]: The one in Woburn.

585
00:53:42,727 --> 00:53:42,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

586
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:44,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

587
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:45,168
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.

588
00:53:46,912 --> 00:53:56,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Just out of curiosity, as a parent who, let's say, has a child with disabilities and they don't know about, you know, the Facebook, or how do they start?

589
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:59,043
[SPEAKER_16]: How do you get them to come to you?

590
00:54:00,524 --> 00:54:08,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, I would say, certainly through our school committee members, we would ask that if you have folks come to you, to please let them know about us, that they can reach out to us at any time.

591
00:54:09,793 --> 00:54:11,934
[SPEAKER_01]: It's medfordcpac.yahoo.com.

592
00:54:12,993 --> 00:54:17,136
[SPEAKER_01]: a Yahoo site, we have our Facebook page, but certainly they can call our phone number.

593
00:54:17,937 --> 00:54:23,481
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the second Wednesday of every month we meet from 7 to 9 at the Andrews Middle School always.

594
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:28,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year we hope to have some coffee hours, maybe some morning appointments as well for families.

595
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:34,028
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some feedback for families that night times are difficult for them, Erin, and it makes it difficult

596
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,411
[SPEAKER_01]: for families to be able to come out at night, so maybe after school drop off in the morning might be another option.

597
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:47,974
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to say, I like to say anyway, that, you know, parenting a child, a student with a disability is extreme parenting, sort of like extreme sports.

598
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:52,816
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's a little bit harder to get out sometimes.

599
00:54:53,571 --> 00:54:54,732
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I totally understand.

600
00:54:56,534 --> 00:55:13,392
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess this would be a question for Kathy, but since she's not here, through the mayor to the superintendent, when a child is in our district and they are special needs, do they receive a packet with all this information?

601
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:14,411
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.

602
00:55:15,632 --> 00:55:18,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind if I answer that, Superintendent Bellson, or would you like to?

603
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,536
[SPEAKER_16]: As long as someone answers that.

604
00:55:22,557 --> 00:55:22,797
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

605
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:35,026
[SPEAKER_01]: In October, Kathy Medaglio sends out, the director of special education sends out a packet with guidelines, parental guidelines and parents' rights.

606
00:55:35,486 --> 00:55:40,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that, they also send a calendar with CPAC events that we've chosen for the upcoming year.

607
00:55:41,273 --> 00:55:42,874
[SPEAKER_01]: and information on how to contact us.

608
00:55:42,914 --> 00:55:44,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have some brochures we're working on.

609
00:55:44,734 --> 00:55:47,455
[SPEAKER_01]: We also set up tables at community day, but certainly.

610
00:55:47,495 --> 00:55:57,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, whenever a person goes to an IEP meeting, whenever a family goes to an IEP meeting, they're supposed to get information about the Special Education Parent Advisory Council during their IEP meeting.

611
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:06,522
[SPEAKER_01]: So parents report to us that sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, but that would be the evaluation team leaders are supposed to share information about the CPAC so they know about us.

612
00:56:06,762 --> 00:56:08,383
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you for that reminder.

613
00:56:09,073 --> 00:56:28,119
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I just want to make sure that, you know, you've all done such wonderful work and it's just always the same, you know, as my colleague just said, it's kind of difficult sometimes when, you know, you're running it and you send out the word and you're asking for parents to come and unfortunately it's not all the time and, you know, it's almost, you know, I don't want to

614
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:37,671
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to say it sounds like the superintendent's night that, you know, you have all these parents in the district and then unfortunately you just have, you know, a small group of parents.

615
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:52,016
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that being said, you being here, being on, you know, at the school committee, having more people, maybe putting it on the blog, things like that, you just hope and pray that word of mouth, it just goes out there more and more.

616
00:56:52,336 --> 00:56:53,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we find, Ms.

617
00:56:53,196 --> 00:56:55,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Cunha, like you do, that people find us when they need us.

618
00:56:56,937 --> 00:56:58,538
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time people come to the,

619
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:01,987
[SPEAKER_01]: CPAC meeting or reach out to me when they're having a problem.

620
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:06,328
[SPEAKER_01]: But the truth is, if you find us ahead of time, maybe you won't have a problem.

621
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:08,188
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great way to take a look.

622
00:57:08,868 --> 00:57:13,490
[SPEAKER_16]: But unfortunately, sometimes you don't have time until it hits you in the back.

623
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I know.

624
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,191
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing I was going to ask you about is the recommendations.

625
00:57:17,211 --> 00:57:19,071
[SPEAKER_16]: You had asked about professional development.

626
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:26,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you asking for professional development more for parents or for people that are involved, for teachers, for staff?

627
00:57:26,449 --> 00:57:34,913
[SPEAKER_01]: We would say for teachers and staff, professional development, especially around collaboration between general education and special education, we find that they operate very separately.

628
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:44,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more they collaborate, as you can see, I think with Dr. Perella and Dr. Riccio and what they're doing at the high school, the more folks collaborate, the better the outcomes are.

629
00:57:45,097 --> 00:57:54,021
[SPEAKER_01]: And we find that, not just we find, but research shows that when students with disabilities are educated in the general education classroom with their typical peers,

630
00:57:54,475 --> 00:58:00,577
[SPEAKER_01]: There's studies that show that the math scores go up, not just for the students with disabilities, for the typical students as well.

631
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,778
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of research around that practice.

632
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:04,278
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has to be done well.

633
00:58:04,578 --> 00:58:06,699
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not done well, then it can be just the opposite.

634
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:10,380
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important, I think, for professional development, for educators, for staff.

635
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:20,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's still a lot of folks in our system that have been in a whole different system years and years ago when things were run very differently and people were segregated very much.

636
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think bringing people up to speed.

637
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach a course on disability awareness

638
00:58:24,202 --> 00:58:27,546
[SPEAKER_01]: at Tufts Medical Center as part of Operation Housecall with the Ark of Mass.

639
00:58:27,606 --> 00:58:29,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And we teach medical doctors.

640
00:58:29,288 --> 00:58:32,452
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in the hospitals for medical doctors to learn about disability.

641
00:58:32,532 --> 00:58:33,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just schools.

642
00:58:33,834 --> 00:58:37,258
[SPEAKER_01]: It's across all platforms.

643
00:58:37,298 --> 00:58:42,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And until you have someone that you love with a disability, it honestly doesn't come to the forefront.

644
00:58:42,164 --> 00:58:43,386
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly didn't for me.

645
00:58:43,965 --> 00:58:44,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

646
00:58:44,345 --> 00:58:47,148
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that it's important that everyone understand.

647
00:58:47,188 --> 00:58:49,890
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know the parents that are involved with this understand this.

648
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:55,294
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is the needs of a child are so different.

649
00:58:55,695 --> 00:59:01,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Even though one child is on an IEP, it could be totally different from another child who's on an IEP.

650
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:10,347
[SPEAKER_16]: As a parent who has gone through that process, I could honestly tell you it's definitely a learning process.

651
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:18,706
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've been very, I guess, grateful to our staff.

652
00:59:19,087 --> 00:59:21,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Had nothing to do with me being on school committee.

653
00:59:22,348 --> 00:59:24,929
[SPEAKER_16]: But it was really done very well.

654
00:59:25,089 --> 00:59:28,111
[SPEAKER_16]: And unfortunately or fortunately, that's how I've learned.

655
00:59:28,171 --> 00:59:30,472
[SPEAKER_16]: I've learned through listening to parents.

656
00:59:30,572 --> 00:59:37,975
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you said, sometimes you don't want to talk about certain things because you just feel like, well, maybe other people don't want to hear about it.

657
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:40,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Or maybe you feel like maybe you are, you know,

658
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:46,566
[SPEAKER_16]: your child's disability isn't as large or as important or whatever as someone else's.

659
00:59:47,246 --> 00:59:48,587
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not.

660
00:59:48,707 --> 00:59:54,791
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you open up and you start speaking about it, it's amazing how you learn and the process that you go through.

661
00:59:54,811 --> 00:59:55,491
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

662
00:59:56,071 --> 00:59:59,093
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think also if people would remember that disability is natural.

663
00:59:59,253 --> 01:00:00,554
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're all disabled someday.

664
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:01,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

665
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:08,175
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, just, you know, always be there for your children to say that, you know, we could try to work it out as best as possible.

666
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:11,577
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um, I do want to recommend and thank you all for your work.

667
01:00:11,957 --> 01:00:12,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

668
01:00:12,617 --> 01:00:13,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

669
01:00:15,438 --> 01:00:15,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

670
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:16,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Stone.

671
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:17,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Melanie, thanks for coming.

672
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:24,822
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure you covered it all, but I was wondering if there's anyone else on the advisory council who Melanie might've missed something that you want to share with us.

673
01:00:25,283 --> 01:00:26,143
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the right time.

674
01:00:30,437 --> 01:00:31,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so there's a couple points.

675
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:35,558
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Jameel Webb Davis, and my son is Quentin Davis, and he's in sixth grade going to seventh grade.

676
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:36,518
[SPEAKER_12]: He has autism.

677
01:00:36,538 --> 01:00:38,139
[SPEAKER_12]: He has high-functioning autism.

678
01:00:38,919 --> 01:00:42,120
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been told that, I've been asked, are you sure he's autistic?

679
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,380
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't seem that autistic.

680
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,860
[SPEAKER_12]: I get that kind of feedback.

681
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:50,661
[SPEAKER_12]: So my struggle is trying to convince people that he needs more support than people want to offer him.

682
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:57,523
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say that when I got involved with CPAC, that's when I got more attention from the district to get help for my son.

683
01:00:57,913 --> 01:01:00,094
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I didn't come to CPAC because I was having a problem.

684
01:01:00,674 --> 01:01:04,975
[SPEAKER_12]: I just noticed when I showed up at a CPAC meeting, I got more attention at my next IEP meeting.

685
01:01:05,676 --> 01:01:07,376
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a shame that that's how it had to happen.

686
01:01:07,396 --> 01:01:12,898
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I get more involved in the community and I show a bit more things, I get more support from my son.

687
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:19,160
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think about all the other parents who can't come to these events and can't show up for whatever reason.

688
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:26,723
[SPEAKER_12]: I have another, my son, I know another mother who has two boys with autism and she's in the hospital with one of them all the time because he has epileptic seizures all the time.

689
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:28,944
[SPEAKER_12]: She can't stop and come to a CPAC meeting.

690
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:30,945
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, well, how is she getting support?

691
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Because she can't show up to try to convince this district.

692
01:01:34,366 --> 01:01:37,548
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's one thing that I think people should think about.

693
01:01:37,608 --> 01:01:40,329
[SPEAKER_12]: There's plenty of parents who can't come for whatever reason.

694
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:41,990
[SPEAKER_12]: And how are they going to get the support?

695
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,212
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other issue is transparency in the district.

696
01:01:45,652 --> 01:01:47,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't feel like there's a lot of transparency with the parents.

697
01:01:48,753 --> 01:01:52,295
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like there are programs in the district.

698
01:01:52,315 --> 01:01:53,055
[SPEAKER_12]: This has happened twice now.

699
01:01:53,075 --> 01:01:56,417
[SPEAKER_12]: There are programs in the district that would be perfect for my son, and I knew nothing about them.

700
01:01:57,715 --> 01:02:06,941
[SPEAKER_12]: And I found out about them through other CPAC mothers, or through a therapist who works in Medford, or through another kid who says, oh, do you know we're doing this great thing at the high school?

701
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:10,443
[SPEAKER_12]: A student shouldn't have to be telling me about programs in the district, or another mother.

702
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I should find out about them from my team, my IEP team.

703
01:02:14,925 --> 01:02:20,248
[SPEAKER_12]: And they should tell me about programs in Medford that are for autistic kids, whether he's appropriate for them or not.

704
01:02:20,349 --> 01:02:24,891
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I should know about this, and we should have a healthy discussion about, oh, no, this doesn't work or does work.

705
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:25,972
[SPEAKER_12]: But I should be aware.

706
01:02:26,591 --> 01:02:31,474
[SPEAKER_12]: And I shouldn't have to find out about a program in the district after my child's been suspended from school six times.

707
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:33,134
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the kind of thing that's happened.

708
01:02:33,675 --> 01:02:36,476
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's my biggest beef with that.

709
01:02:36,576 --> 01:02:37,497
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what I want to say.

710
01:02:37,637 --> 01:02:37,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

711
01:02:38,077 --> 01:02:38,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Jamil.

712
01:02:39,117 --> 01:02:40,798
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Jamil.

713
01:02:40,818 --> 01:02:53,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamil also is the parent who's just volunteered to become a substitute parent for families of homeless children and children in foster care and was a recent graduate of the Parent Leadership Series, but also

714
01:02:54,222 --> 01:03:01,004
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that the CPAC did do this year with the special education department is the programs now are listed on the district website.

715
01:03:01,984 --> 01:03:02,784
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good news.

716
01:03:03,645 --> 01:03:09,846
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one of the advantageous parts of having Jameel on our CPAC, among other folks.

717
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:11,747
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is posted there.

718
01:03:12,427 --> 01:03:16,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is important for folks to be able to have all the information so that they can make informed, healthy decisions.

719
01:03:17,189 --> 01:03:22,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the great things about what I'm excited about the district and our future

720
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:25,013
[SPEAKER_01]: is that we are having these conversations.

721
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:29,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're long overdue, and I think it's really important that we are, so that's very healthy.

722
01:03:30,356 --> 01:03:30,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

723
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:31,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

724
01:03:31,777 --> 01:03:32,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Skerry.

725
01:03:32,418 --> 01:03:41,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam Chairman, I would ask that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting to further address the CPAC concerns and hopefully come up with some resolutions.

726
01:03:42,843 --> 01:03:51,247
[SPEAKER_04]: if there are any budgetary ramifications that we have this meeting with in the next three weeks so that we can address them properly and address parents' concerns.

727
01:03:51,687 --> 01:04:00,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And any other parent that's not here tonight that would like to be at that meeting, could come in and tell us what they expect of us and your two-way street.

728
01:04:00,411 --> 01:04:01,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's fantastic.

729
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:01,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

730
01:04:01,731 --> 01:04:02,432
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate that.

731
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:04,753
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having our elections this Wednesday as well.

732
01:04:04,873 --> 01:04:09,715
[SPEAKER_01]: So CPAC elections are this Wednesday from 7 to 9 at the Andrews Middle School.

733
01:04:10,605 --> 01:04:15,188
[SPEAKER_01]: We have folks running this year for secretary and treasurer and co-chair, so we're very excited about that.

734
01:04:15,689 --> 01:04:16,309
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

735
01:04:16,369 --> 01:04:17,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

736
01:04:18,811 --> 01:04:19,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

737
01:04:21,087 --> 01:04:26,028
[SPEAKER_06]: on the motion that a committee of the whole be held in the very near future, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

738
01:04:26,628 --> 01:04:26,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

739
01:04:26,808 --> 01:04:27,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno.

740
01:04:28,068 --> 01:04:33,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, I, well, first of all, we would love, I'll speak for a lot of us, we would love to be there Wednesday.

741
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,590
[SPEAKER_16]: I know I can't be there Wednesday.

742
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:39,551
[SPEAKER_16]: I have two graduating, but we're all going to be at the graduation ceremony.

743
01:04:39,631 --> 01:04:40,631
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know, I know.

744
01:04:40,731 --> 01:04:49,813
[SPEAKER_16]: And the other thing is, I basically was going to ask if we were able to have some type of a list or something that could be on our webpage or something like that.

745
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:51,609
[SPEAKER_16]: but I think that was already answered.

746
01:04:51,869 --> 01:04:52,450
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was great.

747
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:53,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

748
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:53,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

749
01:04:54,411 --> 01:04:54,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

750
01:04:54,911 --> 01:04:56,793
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion that a committee of the whole, Ms.

751
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:57,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Vandekloot.

752
01:04:57,633 --> 01:05:00,756
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I certainly applaud the desire.

753
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:04,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little concerned about the fact that right now the timing is so tight.

754
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:08,141
[SPEAKER_08]: We're scheduled to go into a budget meeting next Wednesday.

755
01:05:08,601 --> 01:05:16,327
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to be cognizant that the superintendent and the administration are

756
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,861
[SPEAKER_08]: preparing that budget and that takes time.

757
01:05:19,941 --> 01:05:22,681
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not quite sure where we manage.

758
01:05:22,721 --> 01:05:25,122
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got graduation on Wednesday of this week.

759
01:05:25,182 --> 01:05:28,063
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I'm just not quite sure where we're going to put it in.

760
01:05:30,283 --> 01:05:32,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe September might be more advantageous.

761
01:05:33,084 --> 01:05:36,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, folks are, we have a lot of wrapping up of the end of the year things to do as well.

762
01:05:36,525 --> 01:05:41,226
[SPEAKER_01]: And I certainly plan on attending some of the committee of the whole meetings that you already have scheduled.

763
01:05:41,306 --> 01:05:45,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we'll all be a little bit more informed, especially after the budget process, what have you, that

764
01:05:45,857 --> 01:05:50,280
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be better to have a September Committee of the Whole, but I don't want to recommend that for you guys.

765
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, in response to that.

766
01:05:53,682 --> 01:05:53,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

767
01:05:53,923 --> 01:05:57,085
[SPEAKER_06]: On motion, as offered by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

768
01:05:57,105 --> 01:05:58,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call, you requested.

769
01:05:58,346 --> 01:05:58,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call.

770
01:05:58,926 --> 01:05:59,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. O'Neill.

771
01:05:59,607 --> 01:05:59,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

772
01:06:01,228 --> 01:06:01,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

773
01:06:01,648 --> 01:06:01,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

774
01:06:01,728 --> 01:06:02,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

775
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:02,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Branson.

776
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:03,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

777
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:03,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

778
01:06:03,749 --> 01:06:04,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Postone.

779
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:05,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Skerry, yes.

780
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:05,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

781
01:06:05,331 --> 01:06:05,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Anderson.

782
01:06:06,191 --> 01:06:06,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

783
01:06:06,451 --> 01:06:06,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

784
01:06:06,511 --> 01:06:07,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybrook.

785
01:06:07,312 --> 01:06:07,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

786
01:06:07,572 --> 01:06:09,313
[SPEAKER_06]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

787
01:06:09,353 --> 01:06:10,094
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

788
01:06:10,274 --> 01:06:11,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Melanie.

789
01:06:11,455 --> 01:06:12,776
[SPEAKER_06]: That was an outstanding presentation.

790
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:15,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto?

791
01:06:15,301 --> 01:06:23,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just wondering, have we scheduled the subcommittee meeting for community schools to finalize the charges?

792
01:06:23,764 --> 01:06:24,405
[SPEAKER_00]: The pay structure?

793
01:06:24,425 --> 01:06:25,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the pay structure.

794
01:06:25,785 --> 01:06:28,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if we could do both meetings on one night.

795
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:29,911
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll work that in.

796
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:34,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, I was hoping that we'd have something to you before the next school committee meeting.

797
01:06:34,234 --> 01:06:34,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Rate structure.

798
01:06:35,695 --> 01:06:35,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

799
01:06:35,955 --> 01:06:38,436
[SPEAKER_06]: We're supposed to have a community schools rates.

800
01:06:38,456 --> 01:06:43,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up to the chair to call the meeting.

801
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:48,683
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an additional item under community participation.

802
01:06:48,764 --> 01:06:50,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Ellery Klein, elementary recess.

803
01:06:56,737 --> 01:06:57,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

804
01:06:57,357 --> 01:07:01,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening members of the school committee and Mayor Burke and Superintendent Belson.

805
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight.

806
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:05,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to keep it pretty brief.

807
01:07:05,982 --> 01:07:11,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I'm here tonight just, uh, I've been meaning to come for a while to speak on this issue.

808
01:07:11,645 --> 01:07:21,009
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something I've been addressing, um, constantly for the three years I've been in the school system and from many, many conversations with other parents in the school system.

809
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:25,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's a topic of great frustration for a lot of parents and that is, um,

810
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:32,913
[SPEAKER_07]: the recess policy or rather the lack of a recess policy in our school district for elementary schools.

811
01:07:33,874 --> 01:07:44,378
[SPEAKER_07]: So the last few times I've heard Nelson speak, I've heard him talk about the commitment to the education of the whole child and I definitely think there's many ways that we are doing that successfully here.

812
01:07:44,398 --> 01:07:46,419
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw that with Mr. Connor.

813
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:47,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a Roberts parent.

814
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Mr. Connor is

815
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:56,733
[SPEAKER_07]: We cannot thank him enough for what he brings to our school community, not only in music, but also the beautiful flowers outside the building.

816
01:07:57,413 --> 01:08:04,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And our art night, Cheryl Rodriguez over here organized art night, and we saw amazing art that our kids are making in our schools.

817
01:08:05,818 --> 01:08:10,020
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of ways that Medford is succeeding, and I'm very happy with a lot of things here.

818
01:08:12,061 --> 01:08:16,524
[SPEAKER_07]: But recess, I find, we only get 15 minutes of recess.

819
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:20,118
[SPEAKER_07]: at our elementary schools, which isn't really enough.

820
01:08:21,118 --> 01:08:43,573
[SPEAKER_07]: And not only that, we often find that we're struggling to keep recess from being taken away, either partly or completely, for not doing homework, infractions, disciplinary infractions in the classroom, and other reasons, like maybe a lesson takes too long and it just cuts into recess.

821
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I'm asking for tonight, basically,

822
01:08:47,233 --> 01:08:53,596
[SPEAKER_07]: an overarching policy, because when I first started dealing with this issue, I went to Diane Caldwell to ask, what is the policy?

823
01:08:54,056 --> 01:09:07,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there was a feeling among some parents that there was an actual policy written that said recess could only be taken away in case of fear of harm to a child himself or herself, or that that child would harm another student.

824
01:09:07,662 --> 01:09:09,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And it turned out that this was not true.

825
01:09:09,443 --> 01:09:13,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Diane directed me to the Roberts Handbook, where there was kind of a vague,

826
01:09:15,675 --> 01:09:21,219
[SPEAKER_07]: description of if the principal thinks the child should have recess taken away or something to that effect.

827
01:09:21,259 --> 01:09:22,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't go and look that up tonight.

828
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,802
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't very clear exactly what it meant.

829
01:09:26,382 --> 01:09:34,788
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was clear from Diane sending me to the Roberts handbook that there is no policy for the whole school district on this topic.

830
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:42,113
[SPEAKER_07]: So my proposal, there's a lot out there if you search about the benefits of recess to kids.

831
01:09:43,294 --> 01:09:44,035
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the most

832
01:09:45,209 --> 01:09:47,610
[SPEAKER_07]: clear is from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

833
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:55,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of you may be familiar with their June 2013 statement on recess.

834
01:09:56,232 --> 01:10:03,134
[SPEAKER_07]: But if not, and for those watching at home or whatnot, I'd like to just go over a few quick points from that statement.

835
01:10:04,775 --> 01:10:11,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Foremost, the American Academy of Pediatrics believes that recess is a crucial and necessary component of a child's development.

836
01:10:11,636 --> 01:10:13,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And as such, it should not be withheld.

837
01:10:14,045 --> 01:10:15,686
[SPEAKER_07]: for punitive or academic reasons.

838
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:18,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So the AAP basically says it shouldn't happen.

839
01:10:20,748 --> 01:10:25,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Recess represents an essential planned respite from rigorous cognitive tasks.

840
01:10:26,411 --> 01:10:33,174
[SPEAKER_07]: It affords a time to rest, play, imagine, think, move, and socialize.

841
01:10:34,494 --> 01:10:42,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd just like to point out that often I find one of my struggles is understanding what recess is and what it means for a child with many staff members.

842
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:50,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's like the walking recess is a punishment that's given so the kids have to pace back and forth.

843
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:52,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And they say, well, they still get to move their bodies.

844
01:10:53,241 --> 01:11:03,445
[SPEAKER_07]: But this list shows that recess is not just about moving your body, that it really is a time for unstructured play and unstructured activities.

845
01:11:04,645 --> 01:11:06,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And after recess, students are more attentive.

846
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:10,442
[SPEAKER_07]: and better able to perform cognitively.

847
01:11:11,503 --> 01:11:18,272
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, recess helps young children to develop social skills that are otherwise not acquired in the more structured classroom environment.

848
01:11:19,593 --> 01:11:24,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And I might add, as a child of the 70s, I spent my after school hours running around

849
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:26,002
[SPEAKER_07]: with various people from the neighborhood.

850
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:28,043
[SPEAKER_07]: And that happens a lot less now.

851
01:11:28,103 --> 01:11:28,503
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know.

852
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:33,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I fortunately haven't heard of anyone in Medford calling the police when they see children walking down the street.

853
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:52,857
[SPEAKER_07]: But we know that often recess, especially maybe in a Title I school where kids don't have access to some of the sports programs that other kids might, I think it's very important that every kid have this time promised to them to socialize, to imagine, to rest, to move, to think, socialize, et cetera.

854
01:11:53,973 --> 01:11:55,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Through play at recess.

855
01:11:55,314 --> 01:11:57,215
[SPEAKER_07]: So the play is a means.

856
01:11:58,056 --> 01:12:01,579
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not the only goal of recess, which I find is the other thing.

857
01:12:01,759 --> 01:12:05,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Recess is sometimes viewed by administration, staff, and teachers as fun time.

858
01:12:05,982 --> 01:12:06,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun time is optional.

859
01:12:07,143 --> 01:12:12,567
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a little party, and it can be taken away easily, because it's not important to our day at school.

860
01:12:12,947 --> 01:12:13,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I would argue the opposite.

861
01:12:13,908 --> 01:12:21,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Through play, children learn valuable communication skills, including negotiation, cooperation, sharing,

862
01:12:21,907 --> 01:12:26,368
[SPEAKER_07]: and problem solving, as well as coping skills such as perseverance and self-control.

863
01:12:27,049 --> 01:12:40,012
[SPEAKER_07]: So while reading and writing is very important, obviously, to our future life as human beings, I would say that these skills, probably all of you would agree, are the most important when it comes to running a business or working in a job.

864
01:12:41,013 --> 01:12:42,613
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can cooperate and negotiate.

865
01:12:42,893 --> 01:12:46,174
[SPEAKER_07]: These are skills you're not going to learn sitting and doing your common core math.

866
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:48,435
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to learn them out on the play field.

867
01:12:51,871 --> 01:12:52,551
[SPEAKER_07]: with your other kids.

868
01:12:54,412 --> 01:13:07,858
[SPEAKER_07]: On the basis of an abundance of scientific studies, withholding recess for punitive or academic reasons would seem to be counterproductive to the intended outcomes and may have unintended consequences in relation to a child's acquisition of these important life skills.

869
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:16,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So, as I said, recess I find is often characterized as fun or just a time to move your body.

870
01:13:17,052 --> 01:13:21,155
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see from the AAP that they really define recess as something more than that.

871
01:13:21,676 --> 01:13:30,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is the policy I would like to see reflected for all the elementary schools, so that this is not a battle that parents have to fight teacher to teacher, principal to principal, school to school.

872
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:33,285
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be defined by our greater Medford School Committee.

873
01:13:33,965 --> 01:13:38,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And I forget the word I'm looking for.

874
01:13:38,549 --> 01:13:40,310
[SPEAKER_07]: The school administration.

875
01:13:42,091 --> 01:13:43,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So number one.

876
01:13:44,835 --> 01:13:55,323
[SPEAKER_07]: My first point is that I'd like that policy to be put in place so that it's clear to everyone in every school that recess is just as important to a child's day as math, as art, as music.

877
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:58,886
[SPEAKER_07]: That it is a really valuable time where the kids are learning something.

878
01:14:00,768 --> 01:14:04,911
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I said, I find that I'm struggling often with just that definition of recess.

879
01:14:04,931 --> 01:14:13,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel that teachers might need support both understanding what recess is and also finding ways to

880
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:22,711
[SPEAKER_07]: to correct behaviors that are unwelcome or get homework done without taking away recess.

881
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

882
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:29,275
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't have time to research what our social emotional procedures are.

883
01:14:29,295 --> 01:14:33,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if responsive classroom is used in Medford or not.

884
01:14:33,517 --> 01:14:42,302
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know that in responsive classroom, the punishments or, I like to say, the corrective measures are often made to be connected to what the child's done.

885
01:14:42,442 --> 01:14:44,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So homework would have something to do with homework.

886
01:14:45,621 --> 01:14:48,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that, you know, disruption in class has something to do with that.

887
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:53,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not just always just make them walk the school building at recess for five minutes.

888
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:55,265
[SPEAKER_07]: They only have 15, so they're left with 10.

889
01:14:56,445 --> 01:15:00,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And often, you know, getting the coat on in the winter or something, it's even less than that.

890
01:15:01,347 --> 01:15:07,149
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd love to see some support and training for our staff and teachers on this issue.

891
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:12,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And on another note, I often find that the kids stay inside

892
01:15:14,674 --> 01:15:17,515
[SPEAKER_07]: on cold days, and I don't always think they need to.

893
01:15:17,535 --> 01:15:19,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be great for them to get out a bit more, even in cold weather.

894
01:15:23,757 --> 01:15:27,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So lastly, as I said, we only have 15 minutes of recess a day.

895
01:15:28,698 --> 01:15:36,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Asking around parents in other school districts, I found that a lot of schools have two recesses a day.

896
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:40,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them have one recess that's 25 minutes long.

897
01:15:41,261 --> 01:15:42,442
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have a 25-minute and a 15-minute recess.

898
01:15:44,308 --> 01:15:47,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see, I think Medford is a bit behind on this issue.

899
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:53,413
[SPEAKER_07]: So my third request is just maybe we look to the future on how we can maybe rearrange our day.

900
01:15:53,453 --> 01:15:57,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand there's union time issues with the teachers and things like that.

901
01:15:57,536 --> 01:16:06,061
[SPEAKER_07]: But all these other schools that seem to have longer recess times had longer school days on, let's say, the Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and then a shorter day on Wednesday.

902
01:16:06,081 --> 01:16:09,523
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a bit more time for these recess times in the day.

903
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:12,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's basically it, my presentation.

904
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:29,207
[SPEAKER_07]: there to be a clear policy from the top on the importance of recess, the definition of recess, and reminding staff that really taking it away should be a last resort, not the common resort that I know myself and many other parents here have found it to be.

905
01:16:30,328 --> 01:16:37,871
[SPEAKER_07]: And that the teachers get some support and training in something like responsive classroom that will enable them to have the tools to find that alternative.

906
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:40,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I often hear, recess is the only thing I have.

907
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,394
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel that we probably could find something else

908
01:16:44,315 --> 01:16:49,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I said, number three, the long-term vision for maybe finding a way to bring a little bit more recess.

909
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:55,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I think ultimately, as they said, the students are more attentive and better able to perform cognitively.

910
01:16:55,544 --> 01:17:04,010
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we're struggling to raise our MCAS scores and other things, the more time kids have during the day to have recess, that they're going to learn better.

911
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:06,312
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to be better for us as a school district.

912
01:17:06,672 --> 01:17:07,132
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

913
01:17:07,673 --> 01:17:08,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Ellen.

914
01:17:14,523 --> 01:17:19,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, thank you so much for coming forward with this issue.

915
01:17:19,705 --> 01:17:21,766
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't the first time this year we've heard it.

916
01:17:21,826 --> 01:17:23,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's at least the third.

917
01:17:24,747 --> 01:17:31,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently, we met and parents brought this issue up to us at a committee of a whole meeting.

918
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:41,094
[SPEAKER_05]: And even more recently, when we were going over our budgets with our elementary schools, these questions were asked.

919
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:50,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my understanding at that time, and it still is, that recess is only taken away as an extreme last resort.

920
01:17:51,120 --> 01:18:02,703
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has to have at least three different occurrences documented that the student hasn't been able to get their work done in an appropriate amount of time, and that's all that they had.

921
01:18:03,023 --> 01:18:05,144
[SPEAKER_05]: But it had to be documented to take cases.

922
01:18:05,516 --> 01:18:10,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm going to ask through you, through the mayor, to the superintendent, to clarify that.

923
01:18:10,898 --> 01:18:24,262
[SPEAKER_05]: At our committee meetings, our budget meetings when the Columbus School was presenting, I specifically asked the question regarding recess and that children should be given all their recess at all times.

924
01:18:24,403 --> 01:18:31,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was told that we were going to have a policy in place that they had to be three documented times to the parents.

925
01:18:31,705 --> 01:18:38,347
[SPEAKER_05]: that the child hasn't done their homework, and that recess was going to be taken away before that was to ever happen.

926
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:46,590
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm asking if that's in place, and if so, we should just write up that as a policy and put it in all our elementary school handbooks.

927
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,570
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the policy.

928
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:53,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, sometimes you have a policy and not everybody implements it the same way.

929
01:18:54,372 --> 01:18:55,312
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem.

930
01:18:56,573 --> 01:19:01,094
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a discussion we had at a curriculum subcommittee not that long ago, and I think you attended this.

931
01:19:01,966 --> 01:19:02,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, on homework, yeah.

932
01:19:03,286 --> 01:19:03,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you were there.

933
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:06,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we had that discussion at that time.

934
01:19:06,948 --> 01:19:12,569
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we went back out to the buildings and we told them that policy is our policy and follow it.

935
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:20,332
[SPEAKER_00]: And that there are some teachers who feel like, you know, they're hamstrung when a youngster is misbehaving or work is not coming in.

936
01:19:21,032 --> 01:19:23,893
[SPEAKER_00]: And they misuse that policy.

937
01:19:23,973 --> 01:19:25,253
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to stop it.

938
01:19:25,273 --> 01:19:26,213
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them to do it.

939
01:19:26,773 --> 01:19:28,734
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole issue of recess is not a new topic.

940
01:19:29,454 --> 01:19:30,755
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about it many times.

941
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:34,832
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hamstrung a little bit by time and learning requirements.

942
01:19:34,852 --> 01:19:38,234
[SPEAKER_00]: The Medford school day is not as long as some other places.

943
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:43,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to meet that 900-hour requirement from the state.

944
01:19:44,557 --> 01:19:46,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And recess doesn't count.

945
01:19:46,879 --> 01:19:49,420
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that, you know, we're up against the wall on.

946
01:19:49,941 --> 01:19:56,805
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other ways to promote exercise, and there are other ways to do things that perhaps we can look into, and we certainly will.

947
01:19:57,474 --> 01:20:02,596
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe there are ways that active learning can take place when youngsters are moving around.

948
01:20:02,616 --> 01:20:05,256
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a book out not that long ago called Spark.

949
01:20:05,276 --> 01:20:09,578
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen it, which youngsters are up and moving while they're learning.

950
01:20:10,098 --> 01:20:12,359
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good way to get some exercise in as well.

951
01:20:12,879 --> 01:20:14,739
[SPEAKER_00]: But recess is an important topic.

952
01:20:15,059 --> 01:20:16,520
[SPEAKER_00]: No one wants to deny that.

953
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,081
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some issues that we have to sort through.

954
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:22,962
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do not want our faculty to use it as a punishment.

955
01:20:24,022 --> 01:20:26,523
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the same issue years ago in writing, where

956
01:20:27,337 --> 01:20:30,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Some faculty members assign writing as a punishment.

957
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,662
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said we don't want kids to think of writing as a punishment.

958
01:20:33,682 --> 01:20:37,084
[SPEAKER_00]: We want people to think of writing as something you enjoy doing and like to do.

959
01:20:38,885 --> 01:20:40,827
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to work at it.

960
01:20:40,887 --> 01:20:43,469
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly need to have a little more discussion on it.

961
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:47,332
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take, obviously, the input.

962
01:20:48,012 --> 01:20:56,298
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see if we can't, during our administrative meetings, come up with something that might further the issue that Mrs. Kline's raising.

963
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:22,841
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this point, I'd like to make a motion that our policy be placed in every elementary school handbook and that it be placed on our website so that our administrators, our teachers, and our parents are well aware of what the school's policy is in place and that if people aren't following it, it can be part of their improvement plan or their evaluation by their superiors

964
01:21:23,201 --> 01:21:29,365
[SPEAKER_05]: and that everybody is acting on the same page throughout the district, not one school acting differently than another.

965
01:21:29,805 --> 01:21:31,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a motion on the floor.

966
01:21:32,047 --> 01:21:32,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a second.

967
01:21:34,468 --> 01:21:34,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

968
01:21:34,769 --> 01:21:35,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, please.

969
01:21:36,289 --> 01:21:38,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we certainly have it on the web page.

970
01:21:38,551 --> 01:21:39,932
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just make it more prominent.

971
01:21:40,472 --> 01:21:45,135
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll, once again, reinforce it with our principals during the administrative meetings.

972
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:47,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will take place at the close of school.

973
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:49,638
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll make it more of a

974
01:21:51,543 --> 01:21:58,186
[SPEAKER_00]: definitive priority to people that's not going to be taken lightly if people abuse that policy.

975
01:21:58,886 --> 01:22:01,428
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as much as we can do with regard to the policy.

976
01:22:01,828 --> 01:22:05,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with regard to other measures, that's a whole discussion unto itself.

977
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:13,233
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think about what we can do about that given the time and learning constraints and all the other things that we have to meet with regard to state requirements.

978
01:22:13,613 --> 01:22:17,155
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, could you send out notifications to all the principals to get it to the teachers?

979
01:22:17,948 --> 01:22:19,228
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not a punishment time?

980
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:20,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

981
01:22:20,289 --> 01:22:21,769
[SPEAKER_00]: We've said that many, many times.

982
01:22:21,809 --> 01:22:22,309
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it again.

983
01:22:22,769 --> 01:22:27,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Brooke, if there is school handbooks, it should be in the handbooks as well?

984
01:22:27,391 --> 01:22:28,451
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the handbooks.

985
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:33,372
[SPEAKER_05]: In the policy that parents get three notifications in writing before a child loses recess?

986
01:22:33,392 --> 01:22:34,172
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put it out again.

987
01:22:34,592 --> 01:22:34,853
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

988
01:22:35,133 --> 01:22:38,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure every school handbook has that policy.

989
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:38,914
[SPEAKER_05]: In the same language.

990
01:22:39,734 --> 01:22:39,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

991
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:40,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

992
01:22:41,154 --> 01:22:43,895
[SPEAKER_08]: At one time, I recall when this was an issue,

993
01:22:44,358 --> 01:22:48,200
[SPEAKER_08]: many years ago, we started tracking it.

994
01:22:48,721 --> 01:23:06,751
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, it was a bloody pain in the neck for the teachers, but it did enforce what the policy was and that they had to inform the principal when recess was withheld from a student just for tracking purposes.

995
01:23:06,811 --> 01:23:07,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, of course, over the

996
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:12,011
[SPEAKER_08]: period of time, then it sort of fell by the wayside, but at least temporarily.

997
01:23:12,031 --> 01:23:14,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep on hearing this again.

998
01:23:14,053 --> 01:23:19,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're clear on our policy that it is the exception, the exceptional exception.

999
01:23:19,999 --> 01:23:27,887
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not supposed to be something that is done frequently, but yet I keep on hearing it, so we clearly have an ongoing problem.

1000
01:23:29,488 --> 01:23:36,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I am wondering, one of the things you just said, Mr. Superintendent, is recess, part of the problem is recess is not part of time and learning.

1001
01:23:37,232 --> 01:23:45,455
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not considered by the DESC to be important, and maybe what we should do is to write

1002
01:23:47,456 --> 01:24:01,165
[SPEAKER_08]: motion this year to go before the MASC and start advocating for recess minutes to count as an indication of how important those are when we're talking about our whole child.

1003
01:24:01,505 --> 01:24:06,648
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would be an active thing that the Medford School Committee could talk about and take to a statewide level.

1004
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to make that in the form of a motion?

1005
01:24:09,581 --> 01:24:09,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1006
01:24:10,101 --> 01:24:27,529
[SPEAKER_08]: That the MASC, I mean, sorry, that the Medford School Committee craft a motion regarding recess being part of time and learning, which would be brought before the MASC committee, the resolutions committee, which is coming up pretty soon.

1007
01:24:27,549 --> 01:24:28,369
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good thought.

1008
01:24:28,569 --> 01:24:29,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

1009
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:29,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1010
01:24:31,177 --> 01:24:31,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1011
01:24:31,377 --> 01:24:32,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Quint, Ms.

1012
01:24:32,038 --> 01:24:32,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Mustone, sorry.

1013
01:24:34,179 --> 01:24:35,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ellarie, for being here.

1014
01:24:35,641 --> 01:24:44,127
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, though, what I heard you say is that whatever our Roberts handbook says is very vague, and that it doesn't even explain to teachers the importance of recess.

1015
01:24:44,628 --> 01:24:59,900
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know if we could meet to come up with an actual better stated recess policy that we could put in for the new coming year for all families and teachers, maybe even at their orientation, because I'm embarrassed to say I have not read

1016
01:25:00,168 --> 01:25:01,969
[SPEAKER_13]: the recess policy at the Roberts Handbook.

1017
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:05,311
[SPEAKER_13]: But if it's that vague, then we should probably work on rewriting it.

1018
01:25:06,192 --> 01:25:07,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of it is my memory is vague.

1019
01:25:07,393 --> 01:25:08,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it in the form of a motion.

1020
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:10,535
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to make it in the form of a motion.

1021
01:25:10,555 --> 01:25:11,535
[SPEAKER_06]: A separate motion.

1022
01:25:13,136 --> 01:25:13,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

1023
01:25:13,757 --> 01:25:14,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information.

1024
01:25:15,058 --> 01:25:23,763
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, Mia, that it needs to be not just for the Roberts Handbook, but it needs to be our Medford Public School Committee

1025
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:30,530
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not something that... But if it's our vague one is the Roberts, I imagine that's the same vague one in the other three elements, right?

1026
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:41,397
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we need to do as a committee is to look at the four handbooks and see what is actually in our online handbook.

1027
01:25:41,998 --> 01:25:53,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've talked about a couple of other meetings, and if we need to define some wording and make sure that it's clear, that is what we should be doing in terms of...

1028
01:25:53,794 --> 01:25:57,537
[SPEAKER_08]: putting out clarity from the school committee, a policy from the school committee.

1029
01:25:57,777 --> 01:26:07,466
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree with you that, obviously, if Ellery's saying to us, you know, it's really vague, well, we hear that and we need to make it clear.

1030
01:26:08,607 --> 01:26:10,428
[SPEAKER_06]: So on a separate motion offered by Ms.

1031
01:26:10,488 --> 01:26:15,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostone, that a policy be developed prior to the start of school year that applies to all elementary schools.

1032
01:26:16,193 --> 01:26:16,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1033
01:26:17,456 --> 01:26:40,549
[SPEAKER_16]: being involved with a lot of the site council meetings is that if there's a couple of things change in the handbook that's fine but if there's going to be an actual policy the policy has to come in front of the school committee but if it's not the same across the board it just doesn't make sense and we have made it very clear here that that's what we want to do so the policy has to be

1034
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:43,405
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two motions on the floor.

1035
01:26:43,525 --> 01:26:46,526
[SPEAKER_06]: One to submit a resolution to the Mass.

1036
01:26:46,566 --> 01:26:53,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Association of School Committees that we go on record supporting recess being part of time and learning.

1037
01:26:53,568 --> 01:27:00,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a motion, Part B, that a policy be developed prior to the start of the school year that's consistent across the board and applies to all schools.

1038
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:01,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Good?

1039
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:02,050
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1040
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,891
[SPEAKER_06]: On Part A, roll call vote.

1041
01:27:04,911 --> 01:27:04,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1042
01:27:05,831 --> 01:27:06,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Cugno.

1043
01:27:06,271 --> 01:27:06,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1044
01:27:07,551 --> 01:27:07,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1045
01:27:07,771 --> 01:27:08,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Monadello.

1046
01:27:08,092 --> 01:27:08,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1047
01:27:08,272 --> 01:27:08,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1048
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:09,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Grace.

1049
01:27:09,412 --> 01:27:09,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1050
01:27:14,482 --> 01:27:14,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1051
01:27:15,022 --> 01:27:16,403
[SPEAKER_06]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1052
01:27:16,443 --> 01:27:17,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1053
01:27:17,664 --> 01:27:17,984
[SPEAKER_06]: On Ms.

1054
01:27:18,044 --> 01:27:21,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Mustone's resolution for a policy that be developed.

1055
01:27:22,147 --> 01:27:22,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call, please.

1056
01:27:24,908 --> 01:27:25,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1057
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:31,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1058
01:27:32,092 --> 01:27:32,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1059
01:27:32,653 --> 01:27:34,013
[SPEAKER_06]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1060
01:27:34,053 --> 01:27:34,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1061
01:27:34,974 --> 01:27:35,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

1062
01:27:35,574 --> 01:27:35,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1063
01:27:36,114 --> 01:27:36,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1064
01:27:36,455 --> 01:27:36,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1065
01:27:41,888 --> 01:27:47,610
[SPEAKER_06]: report of the superintendent item number two report on department of public health and evaded care coordination grant.

1066
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:55,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Superintendent members of the committee, um, the Medford public schools has been awarded a $15,000 grant from the Massachusetts department of public health.

1067
01:27:56,133 --> 01:28:09,098
[SPEAKER_00]: With us this evening is our supervisor of health services, Tony Vento, who can come up and explain the grant and explain what we're going to do with it and why we want to implement it next year.

1068
01:28:12,017 --> 01:28:14,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Mayor, Superintendent, School Committee members.

1069
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:26,968
[SPEAKER_15]: This was a grant that was written by Stacey Shulman, Jeffrey Lapid, and myself in response to the growing social-emotional learning needs and the physician-diagnosed mental health issues.

1070
01:28:28,249 --> 01:28:41,218
[SPEAKER_15]: We've decided to base our project, which we call the Mental Health Supervision for Clinical Staff, on a multidisciplinary model that parallels the psychiatric consultation model that

1071
01:28:41,788 --> 01:28:46,692
[SPEAKER_15]: clinicians receive out in private practice and in the hospital-based settings.

1072
01:28:47,352 --> 01:28:56,199
[SPEAKER_15]: So our goals are to build student resiliency and increase time on learning by providing support to students.

1073
01:28:57,661 --> 01:29:10,791
[SPEAKER_15]: We look to promote multidisciplinary and interagency collaboration and communication, decrease student visits to the nurse's office and the Councilor's office, decrease student absenteeism

1074
01:29:11,232 --> 01:29:14,374
[SPEAKER_15]: and increase the staff knowledge around mental health concerns.

1075
01:29:15,635 --> 01:29:26,944
[SPEAKER_15]: The way we're going to do this is we gained the grant money that will fund a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist as a consultant to the district.

1076
01:29:27,444 --> 01:29:38,693
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll use co-coordinators, a school adjustment Councilor and a school nurse to identify cases and the school building staff will present the case and

1077
01:29:39,632 --> 01:29:43,975
[SPEAKER_15]: to the psychiatrist at a weekly meeting and they can discuss and review it.

1078
01:29:44,835 --> 01:30:00,043
[SPEAKER_15]: The aim is to develop a behavioral plan and school accommodation plans for the students and we'll track then the students' absentee rates and their visit rates to the Councilors and the nurses.

1079
01:30:02,527 --> 01:30:03,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions?

1080
01:30:03,988 --> 01:30:04,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1081
01:30:04,188 --> 01:30:05,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot.

1082
01:30:05,689 --> 01:30:07,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to thank you for this work.

1083
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:15,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought this was great, an important step for us, and I just was really pleased to read what we're doing, Tony.

1084
01:30:15,917 --> 01:30:16,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1085
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:17,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1086
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

1087
01:30:21,221 --> 01:30:22,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

1088
01:30:22,622 --> 01:30:23,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had a couple questions.

1089
01:30:23,783 --> 01:30:29,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So the pediatric psychiatrists or the clinical psychologists, will they work directly with our students or will they

1090
01:30:30,243 --> 01:30:32,585
[SPEAKER_15]: work with our staff who will work with our students?

1091
01:30:32,605 --> 01:30:32,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Staff.

1092
01:30:32,965 --> 01:30:34,906
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a consultative model to staff.

1093
01:30:35,307 --> 01:30:46,095
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have the advantage of teaching staff about mental health illnesses and approaches that then can be brought down to the level of student accommodation plans in school.

1094
01:30:46,495 --> 01:30:50,098
[SPEAKER_15]: And how will we determine which staff at which schools will take?

1095
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:50,998
[SPEAKER_15]: All levels.

1096
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:53,240
[SPEAKER_15]: High school, elementary, and middle.

1097
01:30:53,981 --> 01:30:58,364
[SPEAKER_15]: So on a weekly rotating schedule, we will have, everybody has a,

1098
01:30:59,062 --> 01:31:03,585
[SPEAKER_15]: a chance once a month to present a case or a couple of related cases.

1099
01:31:04,746 --> 01:31:09,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so every clinician in the district will get a chance to do this?

1100
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:11,431
[SPEAKER_15]: It's up to the school building team.

1101
01:31:13,633 --> 01:31:20,138
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say on that team would be not only the Councilor, the nurse, the teacher, the paraprofessional.

1102
01:31:21,618 --> 01:31:22,998
[SPEAKER_15]: So each school will have a team?

1103
01:31:23,258 --> 01:31:31,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, each school, you know, the Councilors and the coordinators, I should say, will open it up to that school building to say, you know, what case would you like to discuss?

1104
01:31:32,023 --> 01:31:33,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Who would you like involved?

1105
01:31:33,904 --> 01:31:41,649
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, it'll be scheduled on a day when those people can take part in that type of meeting, student faculty meeting.

1106
01:31:42,249 --> 01:31:43,230
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

1107
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:48,473
[SPEAKER_05]: The social and emotional needs of our students have expanded dramatically in the last few years.

1108
01:31:48,533 --> 01:31:49,153
[SPEAKER_05]: As everywhere.

1109
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:51,312
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're not slowing down.

1110
01:31:51,833 --> 01:32:07,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So any way we can bring in funds or experts to help our students and help our teachers, our nurses, in-house adjustment Councilors and therapists, help our kids and our families, that's great.

1111
01:32:07,562 --> 01:32:08,983
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more grants.

1112
01:32:09,103 --> 01:32:09,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep going.

1113
01:32:09,723 --> 01:32:10,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1114
01:32:10,563 --> 01:32:14,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your motion on the floor to receive and place on file.

1115
01:32:14,185 --> 01:32:14,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Ms.

1116
01:32:14,845 --> 01:32:15,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Vanden Heuvel.

1117
01:32:15,485 --> 01:32:16,205
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1118
01:32:16,225 --> 01:32:17,546
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1119
01:32:17,566 --> 01:32:18,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion is passed.

1120
01:32:18,286 --> 01:32:19,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1121
01:32:19,047 --> 01:32:19,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1122
01:32:21,388 --> 01:32:24,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent, report on state budget fiscal 17.

1123
01:32:24,369 --> 01:32:26,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon members of the committee.

1124
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:30,411
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor proposed a 2017 budget.

1125
01:32:30,431 --> 01:32:35,173
[SPEAKER_00]: The House and the Senate then passed their versions and the budget now is in conference committee.

1126
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:49,458
[SPEAKER_00]: The conference committee has to reconcile the legislative differences between the two chambers, and when the conference committee reports out, and generally they'll take a good part of this month to do it, there'll be an up and down vote in each chamber.

1127
01:32:50,599 --> 01:32:55,522
[SPEAKER_00]: If passed by both chambers, they can't make modifications once it comes out of conference committee.

1128
01:32:56,262 --> 01:33:00,365
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go to the governor, and he'll certainly veto a few line items based on his preferences.

1129
01:33:01,065 --> 01:33:05,588
[SPEAKER_00]: It will then go back to the legislature for possible veto overrides, which is typical.

1130
01:33:06,677 --> 01:33:09,579
[SPEAKER_00]: And a final version will then be sent to the governor for enactment.

1131
01:33:10,779 --> 01:33:14,481
[SPEAKER_00]: This process probably won't be completed until towards the end of June.

1132
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:17,382
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be realistic about how that takes place.

1133
01:33:17,803 --> 01:33:19,603
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a typical process in the state.

1134
01:33:20,064 --> 01:33:25,006
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually doesn't happen any sooner than the last week in June, if that at all.

1135
01:33:26,147 --> 01:33:31,089
[SPEAKER_00]: So negotiations begin amid uncertainty over the 2016 revenues.

1136
01:33:33,216 --> 01:33:36,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I wrote this report, there was $260 million behind projections.

1137
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:43,145
[SPEAKER_00]: As of the other day, that projection went up to $311 million behind projections.

1138
01:33:43,765 --> 01:33:49,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Kristen Lepore, who's the Secretary of Administration and Finance, has indicated that they could handle that at the state level.

1139
01:33:49,591 --> 01:33:58,939
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does dampen the kind of thinking that goes on in the legislative chambers, because they're saying to themselves, well, if we're $311 million behind now, what will we be in June?

1140
01:33:59,437 --> 01:34:01,858
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean for carryover money into fiscal 17?

1141
01:34:02,258 --> 01:34:06,560
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just don't know how that's going to play out just yet.

1142
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:10,121
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall budget levels filed so far as follows.

1143
01:34:10,161 --> 01:34:10,861
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor is at $39,553,000.

1144
01:34:10,921 --> 01:34:12,462
[SPEAKER_00]: The House is at $39,539,000 below the governor.

1145
01:34:12,542 --> 01:34:13,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Senate is at $39,558,000.

1146
01:34:14,003 --> 01:34:15,003
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Senate's usually higher.

1147
01:34:15,023 --> 01:34:17,364
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, it comes in somewhere between the House and the Senate.

1148
01:34:26,465 --> 01:34:27,685
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall increase is about 3.59%.

1149
01:34:27,725 --> 01:34:30,286
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate is the highest.

1150
01:34:30,786 --> 01:34:36,607
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, the original projection rate for revenue was going to be 4.3%.

1151
01:34:37,628 --> 01:34:39,248
[SPEAKER_00]: However, right now through April, it's only 1.9%.

1152
01:34:41,268 --> 01:34:45,789
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite a gap in revenue that the state is expecting to have.

1153
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:52,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, the House and the Senate provide similar support for K-12 education.

1154
01:34:53,153 --> 01:34:57,875
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are differences among the 30 line items that need to be reconciled.

1155
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:05,479
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to give you some representative differences because I think they do affect us as we prepare our budget and as we go forward.

1156
01:35:06,359 --> 01:35:11,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So one that I know you're all interested in, the house appropriation for kindergarten is $18.5 million.

1157
01:35:12,142 --> 01:35:13,943
[SPEAKER_00]: That's level funding from this year.

1158
01:35:15,283 --> 01:35:20,206
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate is, that's a mistake, the Senate is at $2 million.

1159
01:35:20,486 --> 01:35:20,926
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

1160
01:35:21,546 --> 01:35:22,787
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate is at $2 million.

1161
01:35:23,996 --> 01:35:28,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Any reduction in this level will affect direct funding coming to Medford for kindergarten.

1162
01:35:28,801 --> 01:35:31,303
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be as much as $150,000.

1163
01:35:32,204 --> 01:35:37,849
[SPEAKER_00]: If the Senate level carries or something lower than what we're getting, we could lose as much as $150,000.

1164
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:39,171
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good.

1165
01:35:40,212 --> 01:35:45,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Charter school funding is still well below the formula entitlement offset local costs for both branches.

1166
01:35:46,578 --> 01:35:48,480
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate is 5 million higher than the House.

1167
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:55,534
[SPEAKER_00]: but neither really addresses the actual gap which could approach $50 million in underfunded entitlement dollars.

1168
01:35:56,515 --> 01:36:05,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford is projected, based on the early returns, to have less students in charters, but we could end up paying more in the current year, because that's the way the funding works.

1169
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:09,282
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the reimbursement goes down, that's a problem.

1170
01:36:10,523 --> 01:36:16,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-resident pupil transportation would be funded at $1.8 million by the Senate, which is $1.5 million more than the House.

1171
01:36:18,169 --> 01:36:20,910
[SPEAKER_00]: The funding line helps to offset the cost of the Minuteman bus.

1172
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:26,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're working on a less expensive cost for that particular vehicle because we have less youngsters going.

1173
01:36:27,313 --> 01:36:29,794
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be able to use a smaller vehicle and pay less for it.

1174
01:36:29,914 --> 01:36:35,536
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, we would like to get that reimbursement because that obviously helps to offset the cost.

1175
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:44,419
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate version puts $350,000 into a new line item that would support the development of alternative assessments of student performance beyond test scores.

1176
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:45,960
[SPEAKER_00]: That's aspirational.

1177
01:36:46,502 --> 01:36:49,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we're going to see much from that, but it's an interesting proposal.

1178
01:36:49,523 --> 01:36:55,484
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate has used the budget process, if you will, to legislate policy issues, which the House has not.

1179
01:36:56,204 --> 01:37:02,286
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real tricky slope because that means the Senate has to convince the House that it should be legislating policy through budget.

1180
01:37:02,846 --> 01:37:05,507
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor has eschewed that at this particular point in time.

1181
01:37:05,527 --> 01:37:06,327
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what happens.

1182
01:37:07,073 --> 01:37:13,137
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate version of the SPED circuit breaker is about $5 million more than the House and approximately $10 million more than the Governor.

1183
01:37:13,797 --> 01:37:16,719
[SPEAKER_00]: This funding line offsets extraordinary special ed costs.

1184
01:37:17,479 --> 01:37:26,364
[SPEAKER_00]: We're projecting that we need somewhere around $283 million in the state to offset the cost to get to 75% reimbursement.

1185
01:37:26,945 --> 01:37:30,367
[SPEAKER_00]: That's worth somewhere in the vicinity of $1.45 to $1.5 million to us every year as it's currently coming to us.

1186
01:37:36,492 --> 01:37:39,293
[SPEAKER_00]: If that goes down, that's money we have to find in our budget.

1187
01:37:39,813 --> 01:37:50,377
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think it's going to go down, we just don't know if it's going to meet the 75% because every year more and more youngsters require care, costs of these placements may go up, and the gap could increase.

1188
01:37:51,417 --> 01:37:53,718
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the main differences affecting Medford.

1189
01:37:54,298 --> 01:37:59,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the House and the Senate provided $55 per pupil minimum additional aid to schools under Chapter 70.

1190
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:03,112
[SPEAKER_00]: This is $35 per pupil higher than the governor's.

1191
01:38:03,833 --> 01:38:05,895
[SPEAKER_00]: It's $30 per pupil higher than last year.

1192
01:38:06,736 --> 01:38:21,649
[SPEAKER_00]: This overall funding goes in directly into the city treasury and is used, obviously, for a number of reasons that the city needs to cover its expenses, including health care, pensions, and other matters that affect schools, but may not be something that you see on a regular basis in our budget.

1193
01:38:22,865 --> 01:38:25,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Homeless transportation is level funded from FY 2016.

1194
01:38:25,707 --> 01:38:28,449
[SPEAKER_00]: This is well below the need.

1195
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:37,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Pat and I are projecting right now that we could have $140,000 in costs next year based on past experience.

1196
01:38:38,675 --> 01:38:41,597
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not getting anywhere near that in reimbursement.

1197
01:38:42,057 --> 01:38:49,742
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was supposedly an unfunded mandate that the state auditor said would be funded, but it hasn't met its expectations at this time.

1198
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,601
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call the legislators up on a regular basis.

1199
01:38:52,661 --> 01:39:06,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I was up the state house today for some time and spoke to some of our people again, but quite frankly, you know, it's hard to know what's happening in the conference committee until they really get serious and what the trade offs are going to be, because there's so many line items in the state budget.

1200
01:39:07,469 --> 01:39:11,571
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody gets one thing, they may give away in something else, but they know what we want.

1201
01:39:12,212 --> 01:39:13,392
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly know what we want.

1202
01:39:14,513 --> 01:39:16,094
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we certainly have,

1203
01:39:16,592 --> 01:39:19,753
[SPEAKER_00]: the support of other school districts who have the same needs as we do.

1204
01:39:20,293 --> 01:39:22,394
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an update so far on the state budget.

1205
01:39:22,754 --> 01:39:29,836
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly affects how we plan our budget because we won't know some of these answers when our budget comes up.

1206
01:39:30,496 --> 01:39:37,338
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be that we have to defer making certain decisions until we know what the actual state funding will be for certain items.

1207
01:39:37,898 --> 01:39:43,460
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll keep you posted and we'll provide some additional information if something breaks to us in the next few days.

1208
01:39:45,003 --> 01:39:45,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1209
01:39:46,104 --> 01:39:48,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to receive and place on file by Ms.

1210
01:39:48,746 --> 01:39:49,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz, seconded by Ms.

1211
01:39:49,746 --> 01:39:50,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuno?

1212
01:39:50,367 --> 01:39:51,107
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1213
01:39:51,127 --> 01:39:51,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1214
01:39:52,488 --> 01:39:53,109
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1215
01:39:53,149 --> 01:39:53,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1216
01:39:55,671 --> 01:39:57,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Report on the public records bill.

1217
01:39:58,412 --> 01:40:01,194
[SPEAKER_06]: A synopsis, Mr. Oh, I'm sorry, the financial report.

1218
01:40:01,935 --> 01:40:08,940
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration, Pat Feely, to bring you up to date on our finances as we approach the end of the fiscal year.

1219
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:10,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1220
01:40:10,681 --> 01:40:10,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Beale.

1221
01:40:14,037 --> 01:40:14,757
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still hoarse.

1222
01:40:15,358 --> 01:40:16,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I still don't have a voice.

1223
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Attached, please find the summary financial report as of June 1st.

1224
01:40:21,742 --> 01:40:25,744
[SPEAKER_02]: As of the writing of this report, the budget is 85.69% expended.

1225
01:40:26,285 --> 01:40:29,547
[SPEAKER_02]: The final 10-month employee teachers paychecks will begin payout June 16.

1226
01:40:29,847 --> 01:40:33,109
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the last regular paycheck.

1227
01:40:33,209 --> 01:40:40,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And then June 21st is the last day of school, and we'll see the final four paychecks to complete the 26 days due per contracts.

1228
01:40:40,494 --> 01:40:42,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's for anybody who is a 10-month employee.

1229
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, six teachers are on maternity leave.

1230
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:49,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Special education will utilize the planned budget.

1231
01:40:49,541 --> 01:40:51,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Budgeted resources were $3.5 million.

1232
01:40:52,142 --> 01:40:54,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, we're encumbered at $1.95.

1233
01:40:55,403 --> 01:40:57,803
[SPEAKER_02]: General fund, idea, just about $1 million.

1234
01:40:58,083 --> 01:40:59,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Circuit breaker, $1.4.

1235
01:41:00,024 --> 01:41:03,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Those numbers will change a little bit as we come into the end of the year and we do our final adjustments.

1236
01:41:04,665 --> 01:41:07,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Telephones, all schools are complete with the new phones.

1237
01:41:07,946 --> 01:41:09,406
[SPEAKER_02]: The only issue is our firewall.

1238
01:41:09,786 --> 01:41:13,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Alan Arena mentioned at the Committee of the Whole,

1239
01:41:13,798 --> 01:41:15,379
[SPEAKER_02]: It's proven very problematic.

1240
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:17,001
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are working on a solution.

1241
01:41:17,021 --> 01:41:22,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan is meeting with network technology tomorrow to try and integrate a solution.

1242
01:41:23,686 --> 01:41:26,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Transportation, bus routes have been running smoothly for the spring months.

1243
01:41:27,349 --> 01:41:30,272
[SPEAKER_02]: The last day of school, June 21, we'll see an early dismissal.

1244
01:41:30,792 --> 01:41:31,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern has been notified.

1245
01:41:32,874 --> 01:41:36,157
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still undecided as of the last day of late runs.

1246
01:41:36,197 --> 01:41:37,718
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still deciding on that one.

1247
01:41:39,183 --> 01:41:41,925
[SPEAKER_02]: The review of routes using the Transfinder software is underway.

1248
01:41:42,145 --> 01:41:48,570
[SPEAKER_02]: The next stage is to sit down with Eastern, review the findings, and make further decisions to improve MPS's routes.

1249
01:41:49,771 --> 01:41:50,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Utilities.

1250
01:41:50,511 --> 01:41:53,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the month of April, natural gas is under budget still by about 25%.

1251
01:41:53,994 --> 01:41:58,817
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all know, warmer than typical winter, less usage.

1252
01:41:59,578 --> 01:42:02,400
[SPEAKER_02]: The savings will assist in the maintenance expenditures.

1253
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Electricity is running over budget by about 4.5%.

1254
01:42:07,097 --> 01:42:12,942
[SPEAKER_02]: That was anticipated, and we have set the budget at 1.18 million to capture that.

1255
01:42:14,163 --> 01:42:22,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Buildings and grounds has been provided information in order to review the buildings that we did not expect an increase at, and they are looking into those buildings and trying to review what's going on.

1256
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:29,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It's minor at those buildings, but if you don't nip it now, we get a regular winter, it could be a real problem.

1257
01:42:31,156 --> 01:42:33,178
[SPEAKER_02]: We have had a new contract settled with the city.

1258
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:38,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And the new rate for electricity supply is 0.0882.

1259
01:42:39,663 --> 01:42:47,746
[SPEAKER_02]: The current rate is 0.0941, or a savings of less than $0.01 per kilowatt hour.

1260
01:42:48,407 --> 01:42:54,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And the savings will be roughly about $70,000, which should assist in maintaining our $1.18 million budget for next year.

1261
01:42:56,690 --> 01:43:03,893
[SPEAKER_02]: The ability to order from General Fund was stopped as of April 22, with the exception of grant and revolving funds and, of course, maintenance emergencies.

1262
01:43:04,415 --> 01:43:09,357
[SPEAKER_02]: The balance of June and into the first two weeks of July will see the payment of invoices that have purchased order approval.

1263
01:43:09,897 --> 01:43:14,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Barring anything unforeseen, the year should close as planned, as in the FY16 budget.

1264
01:43:15,079 --> 01:43:15,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions?

1265
01:43:15,979 --> 01:43:16,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1266
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:18,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

1267
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:19,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1268
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:21,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Pat, thank you so much for this report.

1269
01:43:21,621 --> 01:43:22,381
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very helpful.

1270
01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:30,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really like seeing these because I see the total amount, the appropriation each year for each department.

1271
01:43:30,644 --> 01:43:33,365
[SPEAKER_05]: It always surprises me how much we spend and

1272
01:43:34,385 --> 01:43:37,047
[SPEAKER_05]: how funds are allocated to different departments.

1273
01:43:37,607 --> 01:43:43,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I know that this is helpful to me right now because I'm very self-aware, especially with the budget coming up.

1274
01:43:43,912 --> 01:43:48,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see that some departments don't have as much funding as others.

1275
01:43:50,117 --> 01:43:55,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Our foreign language is under $1 million, but our finance is $1.5 million.

1276
01:43:55,141 --> 01:43:57,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that there are more children's services there.

1277
01:43:57,743 --> 01:44:03,087
[SPEAKER_05]: But that helps me when people come forward to me at budget meetings and ask me for a lot of things.

1278
01:44:03,517 --> 01:44:04,798
[SPEAKER_05]: to have this in front of me.

1279
01:44:04,878 --> 01:44:08,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to say thank you, and I really utilize it well.

1280
01:44:09,282 --> 01:44:12,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike, you give us these, is this a quarterly report?

1281
01:44:13,426 --> 01:44:15,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I give you those every time that I make a presentation.

1282
01:44:16,089 --> 01:44:16,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1283
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:18,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it monthly?

1284
01:44:18,751 --> 01:44:20,833
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much monthly.

1285
01:44:20,993 --> 01:44:25,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And then quarterly, we're getting the community schools now.

1286
01:44:26,012 --> 01:44:28,454
[SPEAKER_05]: When do we get the food services in the rink?

1287
01:44:28,494 --> 01:44:37,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we set up a schedule for finance reports so that way I know exactly which ones we're getting for all of next year ahead of time?

1288
01:44:37,901 --> 01:44:44,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll know every three months I'll get the community schools, the rink fee.

1289
01:44:44,526 --> 01:44:44,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Quarterly.

1290
01:44:45,407 --> 01:44:49,590
[SPEAKER_05]: So those will be added to these ones on a quarterly basis?

1291
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:50,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Quarterly basis.

1292
01:44:50,511 --> 01:44:50,811
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

1293
01:44:50,992 --> 01:44:52,253
[SPEAKER_05]: This one will be monthly.

1294
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:52,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1295
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:53,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, OK.

1296
01:44:53,533 --> 01:44:54,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to make sure.

1297
01:44:54,814 --> 01:44:58,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we had made that motion, and it came forward to us recently.

1298
01:44:58,916 --> 01:45:04,799
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted to maybe have an outline of when we get them, what months we'll get each report.

1299
01:45:05,059 --> 01:45:10,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think sometimes at the end of the year, when we get our budget book, it does have all of those things.

1300
01:45:10,902 --> 01:45:18,326
[SPEAKER_05]: It will have the rink as well, and it will have all of our buildings, all of our facilities, and all of those budgets, the food budget.

1301
01:45:19,066 --> 01:45:20,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct, Mr. Superintendent?

1302
01:45:20,687 --> 01:45:21,788
[SPEAKER_06]: All budgets that are under the school.

1303
01:45:22,328 --> 01:45:22,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1304
01:45:24,304 --> 01:45:29,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so those will all be presented soon when you present us with our next year budget.

1305
01:45:29,549 --> 01:45:33,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Will it also have what we used this year and how funds were allocated?

1306
01:45:33,933 --> 01:45:47,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I know sometimes we use community school, you know, if we have extra money in one budget to transfer it for a shortage in another budget, does the school committee vote for that or is that just something that's appropriated?

1307
01:45:47,785 --> 01:45:49,146
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that at the end of the year.

1308
01:45:49,206 --> 01:45:50,888
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a single appropriation.

1309
01:45:51,602 --> 01:45:55,144
[SPEAKER_00]: as opposed to the council, which has individual line items.

1310
01:45:55,604 --> 01:45:59,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have rights to move.

1311
01:45:59,586 --> 01:46:02,068
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we always give you that at the end.

1312
01:46:02,128 --> 01:46:11,993
[SPEAKER_00]: And once everything's reconciled, but it takes a while for it to reconcile because things come in during the summer, they're encumbered, they're held over until they're actually paid utility bills, things of that type.

1313
01:46:12,033 --> 01:46:17,036
[SPEAKER_00]: So until we actually see the actual numbers, you don't want to make a million changes just simply on the fly.

1314
01:46:17,656 --> 01:46:18,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1315
01:46:18,296 --> 01:46:18,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I, I,

1316
01:46:19,657 --> 01:46:32,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked a little bit about this a little earlier about, I know when we met about community schools, there was some community people here that wanted to change what we had initially set, and we were going to meet again.

1317
01:46:32,983 --> 01:46:40,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Will we be meeting so that way we have those budget numbers for the summer programs and for next year's programs?

1318
01:46:41,287 --> 01:46:42,148
[SPEAKER_05]: For the rate structure?

1319
01:46:42,268 --> 01:46:42,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1320
01:46:42,988 --> 01:46:46,850
[SPEAKER_00]: The rate structure, we're going to provide to you probably by the next meeting.

1321
01:46:46,910 --> 01:46:48,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, our recommended rate structure.

1322
01:46:49,327 --> 01:46:50,628
[SPEAKER_00]: That's being worked on right now.

1323
01:46:50,888 --> 01:46:51,208
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1324
01:46:51,528 --> 01:46:51,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that.

1325
01:46:52,048 --> 01:46:58,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we were talking about, I know that the committee chairperson was talking about June 22nd.

1326
01:46:58,491 --> 01:47:02,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't know if that was a definite date for that subcommittee meeting.

1327
01:47:02,092 --> 01:47:03,333
[SPEAKER_06]: The chairperson will call the meeting.

1328
01:47:13,577 --> 01:47:16,658
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I'd say is that let us concentrate on budget right now.

1329
01:47:17,455 --> 01:47:19,677
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got a number of things we've got to do.

1330
01:47:19,737 --> 01:47:21,078
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a serious period.

1331
01:47:21,658 --> 01:47:24,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to try to get tied up with too many things.

1332
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:28,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to put anybody off, but this is the most important thing you do.

1333
01:47:29,204 --> 01:47:35,788
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I have to be running other meetings and going here and doing side bets, I'm not giving you my full attention.

1334
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,729
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the close of school.

1335
01:47:36,749 --> 01:47:37,429
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things.

1336
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:38,490
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hiring of teachers.

1337
01:47:38,530 --> 01:47:40,151
[SPEAKER_00]: There's things that have to go on.

1338
01:47:40,952 --> 01:47:45,916
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll get you the material, but let's not try and squeeze everything in because you

1339
01:47:46,787 --> 01:47:51,991
[SPEAKER_00]: You make it more difficult to concentrate on the things that really will make a difference for you going forward.

1340
01:47:52,531 --> 01:47:52,972
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get it.

1341
01:47:53,352 --> 01:47:54,753
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not pulling anything back.

1342
01:47:54,773 --> 01:47:55,513
[SPEAKER_00]: You always get it.

1343
01:47:55,613 --> 01:47:57,735
[SPEAKER_00]: But the issue is, you know, timing it.

1344
01:47:58,195 --> 01:48:01,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will bring you something by we have a meeting on the 20th, I believe.

1345
01:48:01,718 --> 01:48:03,719
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have stuff well in advance of that to look at.

1346
01:48:03,759 --> 01:48:06,161
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not need a subcommittee because we'll explain it.

1347
01:48:06,481 --> 01:48:08,443
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to just look at it and say, yeah, that works.

1348
01:48:09,904 --> 01:48:10,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1349
01:48:10,264 --> 01:48:15,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, my final thought on that issue is that, uh, I, I've seen that, um,

1350
01:48:16,288 --> 01:48:19,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Camps and programs are being advertised for this summer.

1351
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:30,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to make sure that everything goes through the community schools and our new online payment system for starting July 1st.

1352
01:48:30,134 --> 01:48:38,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So if all coaches and anybody who plans on using our facilities is made aware of that, that would be extremely helpful.

1353
01:48:38,697 --> 01:48:40,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have been seeing things online.

1354
01:48:41,053 --> 01:48:48,198
[SPEAKER_05]: that are concerning, that maybe everybody in the community doesn't know the new process yet.

1355
01:48:48,618 --> 01:48:50,979
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would just like that to be communicated.

1356
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:57,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that you're busy, but I wanted to make sure that we didn't run into the same situations that we had earlier this year.

1357
01:48:58,084 --> 01:49:09,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like you to address that before the facility is being rented or used and that everybody goes through the proper way and the new way so that we know

1358
01:49:09,998 --> 01:49:13,621
[SPEAKER_05]: We can look at the calendar and say, so-and-so is renting the fields.

1359
01:49:13,681 --> 01:49:16,223
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were up at the fields and they're using the fields, that's great.

1360
01:49:16,564 --> 01:49:20,047
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone else is using the fields, we can say, hey, how come someone's on the field?

1361
01:49:20,107 --> 01:49:21,448
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not rented for this time.

1362
01:49:22,329 --> 01:49:25,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And who's going to manage that and make sure that's going to happen?

1363
01:49:25,031 --> 01:49:28,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like some of those answers before we adjourn for the summer.

1364
01:49:29,635 --> 01:49:30,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1365
01:49:30,255 --> 01:49:30,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1366
01:49:30,475 --> 01:49:30,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Krautz.

1367
01:49:31,877 --> 01:49:33,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Pat, for your report.

1368
01:49:33,418 --> 01:49:34,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I always enjoy them.

1369
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:36,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I like reading them because they're easy to read instead of the numbers.

1370
01:49:37,598 --> 01:49:45,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have a question, because I know you're working with Transfinder, and I wanted to just check in with you.

1371
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:58,322
[SPEAKER_09]: There was an open issue with a person that called last year, and he's called again this year, and he wanted to have his bus stop moved from Waddell and Park.

1372
01:49:58,803 --> 01:50:05,244
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm wondering if there's any way to check in with the Transfinder and see if there's another route that might be possible.

1373
01:50:05,748 --> 01:50:30,266
[SPEAKER_09]: even a little ways down the street, there was another corner that I had met with this resident once before, but on Park Ave, the next street over, that was almost a better location, and it's still gonna come up the same route, it's gonna come up Highland, the kids aren't gonna get out on the Highland Ave, and the bus would take the right onto Park Ave,

1374
01:50:30,633 --> 01:50:36,636
[SPEAKER_09]: and just go right by Waddell to the very next corner, which is almost like the size of the bus.

1375
01:50:37,136 --> 01:50:41,519
[SPEAKER_09]: And the bus could stop nicely right there, and then cars couldn't get around.

1376
01:50:41,959 --> 01:50:52,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's ideal with the four-corner stop, but what the resident told me was that what he saw was cars were going around the bus, even when the lights were on.

1377
01:50:52,965 --> 01:50:59,028
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said it was more of a safety issue, because even though the lights would be on, the cars would just, you know,

1378
01:50:59,832 --> 01:51:02,028
[SPEAKER_09]: going around it, you know, even though it's against the law.

1379
01:51:02,476 --> 01:51:06,318
[SPEAKER_09]: they were, you know, and so, you know, that was just an idea.

1380
01:51:06,378 --> 01:51:06,859
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1381
01:51:06,879 --> 01:51:13,102
[SPEAKER_09]: If we had to just move it just a nudge over to the next street, which is really just like 50 feet.

1382
01:51:13,502 --> 01:51:16,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have been looking at that stop as I've been working through Transfinder.

1383
01:51:17,264 --> 01:51:22,487
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have to remember that some of those children are actually coming from the other side of that stop.

1384
01:51:22,948 --> 01:51:28,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving it forward or moving it off to the right makes them walk further and they're young.

1385
01:51:28,651 --> 01:51:31,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I am looking at several alternatives and once I have that written down,

1386
01:51:32,429 --> 01:51:34,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll share them with you and maybe we can have a discussion.

1387
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:35,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1388
01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:35,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

1389
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:36,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1390
01:51:37,871 --> 01:51:38,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

1391
01:51:38,351 --> 01:51:40,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to receive in place on file by Ms.

1392
01:51:40,892 --> 01:51:43,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Van de Kloof, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1393
01:51:43,453 --> 01:51:44,133
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1394
01:51:44,694 --> 01:51:44,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1395
01:51:44,814 --> 01:51:45,394
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1396
01:51:45,434 --> 01:51:46,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1397
01:51:48,295 --> 01:51:50,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Superintendent, report on public records bill.

1398
01:51:50,696 --> 01:51:51,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1399
01:51:51,356 --> 01:51:53,937
[SPEAKER_00]: So last Friday, pardon me?

1400
01:51:54,217 --> 01:51:59,539
[SPEAKER_00]: So on last Friday, the governor signed the public records bill.

1401
01:52:00,101 --> 01:52:05,025
[SPEAKER_00]: that the legislature finally put together over the last several months.

1402
01:52:05,745 --> 01:52:07,006
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through the whole thing.

1403
01:52:07,026 --> 01:52:07,827
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot here.

1404
01:52:08,487 --> 01:52:23,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we need to go through it more carefully, but there are new enforcement procedures in this, and there are new requirements under the public records law, which means that we've got to be that much more attuned to when people make certain requests.

1405
01:52:24,079 --> 01:52:29,383
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, you know, there is a need to

1406
01:52:30,258 --> 01:52:40,884
[SPEAKER_00]: to rethink electronic records versus paper records, who's the custodian of these things, and what constitutes a public record versus what constitutes something that's exempt.

1407
01:52:41,364 --> 01:52:44,967
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple exemptions from the public records law.

1408
01:52:45,687 --> 01:52:51,150
[SPEAKER_00]: The Secretary of State has yet, obviously just got passed, to issue regulations.

1409
01:52:51,210 --> 01:52:53,872
[SPEAKER_00]: When he issues those regulations, that will be another

1410
01:52:54,768 --> 01:52:55,448
[SPEAKER_00]: step forward.

1411
01:52:55,508 --> 01:52:59,170
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is scheduled to go into effect on January of 2017.

1412
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:08,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the next several months, we'll be watching very closely to see what the regulatory requirements are and how that fleshes out the requirements of the law.

1413
01:53:09,195 --> 01:53:18,579
[SPEAKER_00]: But please read it, go over it, and we'll pay attention to it as well and keep you informed so that if these matters come up, we can handle them appropriately.

1414
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:24,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say one thing that you've got to be aware of, your email is a public record.

1415
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:32,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Your email is a public record, so if you say something you don't want to say in your email, it could be discovered.

1416
01:53:33,062 --> 01:53:42,525
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to think about that a little bit because sometimes, you know, you say something in a sort of out there way and you don't really want to broadcast that.

1417
01:53:44,405 --> 01:53:46,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Mr. Superintendent.

1418
01:53:48,317 --> 01:53:54,360
[SPEAKER_08]: So this clearly is an issue not only for the school committee, but the city of Medford overall.

1419
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:59,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, so at some point as it becomes refined, that needs to be posted.

1420
01:53:59,082 --> 01:54:10,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I also see that there is a reasonable, a city or town may charge a reasonable fee, and I would think that they would need to have some discussion about what a reasonable fee is for this request.

1421
01:54:10,367 --> 01:54:11,007
[SPEAKER_00]: It's set by law.

1422
01:54:11,027 --> 01:54:12,167
[SPEAKER_00]: It's set now.

1423
01:54:12,448 --> 01:54:12,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

1424
01:54:14,081 --> 01:54:20,844
[SPEAKER_08]: So when this is, when everything is settled, I would certainly want to have it on our website.

1425
01:54:23,266 --> 01:54:23,426
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1426
01:54:24,266 --> 01:54:26,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to accept.

1427
01:54:28,228 --> 01:54:29,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for suspension.

1428
01:54:29,689 --> 01:54:29,909
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1429
01:54:29,949 --> 01:54:33,551
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion that we receive in place on file, this report by Ms.

1430
01:54:33,571 --> 01:54:35,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot and seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1431
01:54:35,271 --> 01:54:35,952
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1432
01:54:36,152 --> 01:54:36,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1433
01:54:36,572 --> 01:54:37,412
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1434
01:54:37,432 --> 01:54:38,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1435
01:54:39,654 --> 01:54:41,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for suspension of the rules.

1436
01:54:41,254 --> 01:54:41,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

1437
01:54:42,315 --> 01:54:42,475
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1438
01:54:42,925 --> 01:54:44,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1439
01:54:44,946 --> 01:54:46,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not sure if the person wants this.

1440
01:54:47,007 --> 01:54:47,427
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the?

1441
01:54:52,049 --> 01:54:53,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for suspension of the rules offered by Ms.

1442
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:57,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostone so that a citizen parent could speak.

1443
01:54:58,452 --> 01:54:58,593
[SPEAKER_06]: On.

1444
01:54:58,973 --> 01:54:59,093
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1445
01:55:01,308 --> 01:55:02,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, my name is Elizabeth Light.

1446
01:55:02,349 --> 01:55:03,670
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a parent at the Brooks School.

1447
01:55:04,311 --> 01:55:14,840
[SPEAKER_14]: And we met with Superintendent Belson, some of the PTO members last week to discuss the process for hiring the new principal.

1448
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,962
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could just hold that actually is the next item.

1449
01:55:16,982 --> 01:55:17,622
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the next item.

1450
01:55:17,662 --> 01:55:18,143
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1451
01:55:20,004 --> 01:55:22,286
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a report on the Brooks Principalship.

1452
01:55:22,306 --> 01:55:25,269
[SPEAKER_06]: If the superintendent could offer his report, and then you could add to it.

1453
01:55:25,529 --> 01:55:25,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1454
01:55:27,171 --> 01:55:27,391
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1455
01:55:27,411 --> 01:55:28,692
[SPEAKER_00]: So Madam Mayor and members of the committee,

1456
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:37,428
[SPEAKER_00]: As you previously had reported, Kevin Andrews is leaving to take a position as principal of the Nahant Elementary School.

1457
01:55:39,589 --> 01:55:52,837
[SPEAKER_00]: So on Wednesday, June 1st, I met with the faculty, along with Diane Caldwell, over at the Brooks, and then I met with the parent leadership team to hear their viewpoints on a succession plan.

1458
01:55:53,978 --> 01:55:57,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Both meetings were very informative, but the conclusions were very identical.

1459
01:55:58,133 --> 01:56:02,116
[SPEAKER_00]: There's virtually unanimous consensus to appoint an internal person to the position.

1460
01:56:02,816 --> 01:56:04,597
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a strong desire for continuity.

1461
01:56:05,097 --> 01:56:07,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a significant confidence in the current assistant principal.

1462
01:56:08,540 --> 01:56:10,961
[SPEAKER_00]: The superintendent concurs with that expression of support.

1463
01:56:11,942 --> 01:56:19,066
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless the school committee really wants to go through a process that's different, I really don't want to run a pony show for anybody.

1464
01:56:19,106 --> 01:56:24,550
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to bring people in and pretend that we're having real interviews when I really believe that

1465
01:56:26,732 --> 01:56:32,515
[SPEAKER_00]: it could very well be something that we'll have a known conclusion before we even get started.

1466
01:56:32,915 --> 01:56:46,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally, I'll speak to the unions about posting issues, but I would like to obviously, um, know that let allow the Brooks community to know the result before they go home, uh, the summer and also to allow for planning to continue.

1467
01:56:46,242 --> 01:56:55,987
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also will inform the budget process as well, because if I make moves internally, uh, that has some cost savings associated with it, which I think is a distinct advantage to us.

1468
01:56:56,460 --> 01:56:57,440
[SPEAKER_00]: given this year's budget.

1469
01:56:57,841 --> 01:57:00,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm bringing it to your attention.

1470
01:57:00,341 --> 01:57:01,922
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get some feedback from you.

1471
01:57:02,022 --> 01:57:03,723
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously someone wants to speak on it.

1472
01:57:03,783 --> 01:57:08,144
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be happy to hear what people have to say, but that's my thinking on it right now.

1473
01:57:08,745 --> 01:57:09,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Floor is yours.

1474
01:57:12,506 --> 01:57:23,570
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say that, uh, when we met with, uh, superintendent Bellson last week, we, um, I think everyone there, there were about 10 of us, um, support, um, hiring, uh, the assistant principal.

1475
01:57:24,377 --> 01:57:24,897
[SPEAKER_14]: promoting her.

1476
01:57:26,158 --> 01:57:39,721
[SPEAKER_14]: The parents have a great relationship with her and I get the sense the teachers do as well and we know the children really look to her for, she's a very nurturing presence in the school and also excellent.

1477
01:57:40,341 --> 01:57:43,382
[SPEAKER_06]: She also did a fabulous job at our meeting for the pre-budget meeting.

1478
01:57:43,542 --> 01:57:45,062
[SPEAKER_06]: She did an excellent job presenting.

1479
01:57:45,082 --> 01:57:46,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1480
01:57:47,898 --> 01:57:48,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1481
01:57:48,078 --> 01:57:48,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Cuno.

1482
01:57:49,759 --> 01:57:58,422
[SPEAKER_16]: With that being said, though, if that does happen, then we will be looking for an assistant principal at that point.

1483
01:57:58,442 --> 01:58:01,283
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll appoint an assistant principal afterwards, but one step at a time.

1484
01:58:01,643 --> 01:58:01,923
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1485
01:58:02,003 --> 01:58:09,385
[SPEAKER_16]: And would you know if that would be someone internal, or would that also be someone who you would be putting the process out there to post it?

1486
01:58:09,925 --> 01:58:11,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll first look internally.

1487
01:58:11,266 --> 01:58:17,508
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we look internally is because we'd like to give our people opportunity, one, but two, is also a distinct budget advantage.

1488
01:58:18,070 --> 01:58:27,493
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a senior member of the faculty who is qualified to be an assistant principal, it certainly helps to replace that person with a lower salary and recapture some budget funds.

1489
01:58:28,033 --> 01:58:36,136
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of advantages to going internally, but if that didn't come to pass and it wasn't something that worked out, then we would do what we have to do.

1490
01:58:36,276 --> 01:58:36,416
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1491
01:58:36,456 --> 01:58:39,076
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I know we're on the Brooks, but what about the Andrews?

1492
01:58:39,477 --> 01:58:39,837
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry?

1493
01:58:39,897 --> 01:58:40,837
[SPEAKER_16]: What about the Andrews?

1494
01:58:42,949 --> 01:58:50,074
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on a solution there too and I really don't want to speak to that right now because I have to talk to Paul DeLeva in the morning.

1495
01:58:51,195 --> 01:59:01,823
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm very budget conscious right now and I'm looking internally as much as I can because obviously anything I can save allows you to have a little bit more in other areas that you

1496
01:59:02,671 --> 01:59:03,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have some interest.

1497
01:59:03,872 --> 01:59:11,997
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to make sure, as you mentioned, that we do everything in the proper way and make sure that we handle it with the proper procession of like the unions and everything else.

1498
01:59:12,097 --> 01:59:15,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas if we're not going to post it, we have to do it properly.

1499
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:16,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1500
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:17,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Benedetto.

1501
01:59:17,661 --> 01:59:25,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I have a, um, I have a great knowledge of the assistant principal at the Brooks school.

1502
01:59:25,526 --> 01:59:30,029
[SPEAKER_05]: She was my daughter's teacher and that was our first year here in the method public schools.

1503
01:59:30,469 --> 01:59:31,830
[SPEAKER_05]: She's an excellent educator.

1504
01:59:32,462 --> 01:59:38,764
[SPEAKER_05]: She really was able to differentiate instruction to everyone in her classroom at that time.

1505
01:59:39,144 --> 01:59:41,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched her grow within the community.

1506
01:59:41,024 --> 01:59:44,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very happy with her becoming the assistant principal.

1507
01:59:45,285 --> 01:59:49,086
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wholeheartedly endorse this candidate for that position.

1508
01:59:49,506 --> 01:59:52,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So just so you have it on record, you have my blessing.

1509
01:59:52,727 --> 01:59:53,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1510
01:59:53,127 --> 01:59:55,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Which you don't usually get, but I thought you'd like to hear that.

1511
01:59:57,908 --> 01:59:58,728
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK.

1512
01:59:58,768 --> 01:59:59,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Maren.

1513
01:59:59,629 --> 02:00:00,569
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it.

1514
02:00:01,612 --> 02:00:01,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1515
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

1516
02:00:02,992 --> 02:00:11,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I also just wanted to mention that over the time, the opportunities that I've had seeing the assistant principal interact with parents and with us.

1517
02:00:12,495 --> 02:00:25,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, as you said, she did a great job answering questions and fielding questions when the school council reports were submitted both this year and last year.

1518
02:00:25,438 --> 02:00:30,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would very much concur that it seems like there's wide

1519
02:00:31,608 --> 02:00:37,170
[SPEAKER_08]: spread support from the people I've spoken to, and I think that this would be a very good move.

1520
02:00:37,490 --> 02:00:43,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I, too, don't wish to do a process, which is, you know, you said dog and pony show.

1521
02:00:44,272 --> 02:00:45,173
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need to do that.

1522
02:00:45,193 --> 02:00:51,075
[SPEAKER_08]: I was curious, were there any other people who had come to speak on this tonight?

1523
02:00:52,975 --> 02:00:53,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

1524
02:00:54,796 --> 02:00:56,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1525
02:00:56,596 --> 02:00:57,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Interim or permanent?

1526
02:01:00,018 --> 02:01:01,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Interim or permanent?

1527
02:01:01,650 --> 02:01:02,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'd make it permanent.

1528
02:01:02,871 --> 02:01:03,631
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd make it permanent.

1564
02:02:14,444 --> 02:02:17,266
[SPEAKER_06]: His wife Connie was an account clerk in the payroll office.

1565
02:02:17,486 --> 02:02:19,248
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could all rise to take a moment of silence.

1566
02:02:37,443 --> 02:02:42,625
[SPEAKER_00]: West Foote was the foreman carpenter of the public schools for many, many years.

1567
02:02:43,525 --> 02:02:52,549
[SPEAKER_00]: And West was a very gentle soul, big man, very strong and very, you know, impressive kind of guy, very quiet.

1568
02:02:53,309 --> 02:03:01,593
[SPEAKER_00]: His wife Connie was one of the key people in the payroll office, and the two of them, you know, would see each other because they were basically both part of the central office.

1569
02:03:02,684 --> 02:03:04,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And Wes was very, very skilled.

1570
02:03:04,324 --> 02:03:07,405
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to, you know, explain to Wes how to make something happen.

1571
02:03:07,765 --> 02:03:08,746
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to make it happen.

1572
02:03:09,366 --> 02:03:12,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Foote family was very active in the community for many, many years.

1573
02:03:12,487 --> 02:03:17,688
[SPEAKER_00]: His daughter, Linda, and daughter-in-law, Linda, and his son, Wes, Jr.

1574
02:03:18,368 --> 02:03:24,350
[SPEAKER_00]: So very close to them, very good people, you know, and 95 years old.

1575
02:03:24,370 --> 02:03:25,750
[SPEAKER_00]: 95 years old.

1576
02:03:25,811 --> 02:03:26,371
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless him.

1577
02:03:26,391 --> 02:03:31,012
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a great player, and I can still see Wes coming through the corridor.

1578
02:03:31,737 --> 02:03:32,797
[SPEAKER_00]: looking with Ernie Demon.

1579
02:03:32,817 --> 02:03:34,558
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember Ernie Demon at all.

1580
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:36,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Ernie Demon, the two of them.

1581
02:03:36,939 --> 02:03:40,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Ernie being the character in the crowd and Wes being the straight shooter.

1582
02:03:41,301 --> 02:03:46,183
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really kind of funny because Ernie would say something and Wes would say, oh, Ernie, stop that.

1583
02:03:46,683 --> 02:03:49,545
[SPEAKER_00]: But really good, really highly skilled people.

1584
02:03:49,985 --> 02:03:51,245
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could do a lot of things.

1585
02:03:51,706 --> 02:03:53,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, we had several carpenters.

1586
02:03:55,547 --> 02:03:58,929
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really did some really nice things in school to keep them up and running.

1587
02:03:59,029 --> 02:04:01,170
[SPEAKER_00]: And very fond memories of Wes.

1588
02:04:01,190 --> 02:04:01,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Good guy.

1589
02:04:02,193 --> 02:04:03,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Mr. Superintendent.

1590
02:04:04,936 --> 02:04:07,839
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at the bottom of our agenda with negotiations and legal matters.

1591
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:11,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to go into executive session to discuss these items?

1592
02:04:12,124 --> 02:04:12,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Ms.

1593
02:04:12,745 --> 02:04:13,986

[SPEAKER_06]: Cunha wants to make a public statement.

1599
02:04:26,809 --> 02:04:27,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, please.

1600
02:04:27,229 --> 02:04:36,155
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say, because I know it's at the end of the year and it's kind of hard to get everybody in, but I just want to say that the superintendent and I had a great opportunity this Sunday.

1601
02:04:36,195 --> 02:04:38,117
[SPEAKER_16]: We were down at the Italian Republic.

1602

[SPEAKER_16]: They were celebrating their 70th year anniversary and four of our high school students won first place across the state.

1603
02:04:46,302 --> 02:04:49,826
[SPEAKER_16]: on essays that they wrote, and we were very, very proud of them.

1604
02:04:50,227 --> 02:04:54,672
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd also like to congratulate the road team and their coaches coming in second at the JBL.

1605
02:04:55,033 --> 02:04:56,534
[SPEAKER_16]: They are now second in the state.

1606
02:04:57,235 --> 02:05:02,582
[SPEAKER_16]: And our girls softball team going off to the second game, hopefully tomorrow night without any lightning or thunder.

1607
02:05:03,692 --> 02:05:17,838
[SPEAKER_16]: against Lexington, so our best wishes to them, and also to congratulate the Curtis Tufts students for their graduation tomorrow, and for the Medford High School and Vocational School students on their graduation on Wednesday evening.

1608
02:05:18,638 --> 02:05:27,181
[SPEAKER_16]: May they keep safe, healthy, and achieve all their goals, and their dreams, and come back as visitors, not students.

1609
