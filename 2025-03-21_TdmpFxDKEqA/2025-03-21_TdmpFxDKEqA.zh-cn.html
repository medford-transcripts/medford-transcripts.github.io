 您好，学校委员会成员，学监先生。
 感谢您今晚邀请我们来到这里。
 很高兴看到机器人俱乐部和钟声。
 他们非常放松。
 我叫梅兰妮·珀金斯·麦克劳克林，是梅德福特殊教育家长咨询委员会的联合主席。
 我们有一个 PowerPoint 演示文稿要与您分享，但首先我们想分享它，好吧，不是真的，我们可以开始它。
 我们作为梅德福特殊教育家长咨询委员会的代表来到这里，每年我们都会颁发社区合作伙伴奖。
 还有今年的社区合作伙伴奖。
 它始终是为了促进社区内外各种背景的人们的接受和包容。
 今年的奖项将颁给劳伦斯纪念医院，该医院与梅德福高中和特殊教育部合作已有 15 年。
 医院的志愿者计划由 Tracy Murray 协调，为各种能力的梅德福高中学生提供持续的机会，让他们为社区做出贡献，同时在校外发展和练习技能。
 作为志愿者，学生与主管互动并学习特定技能，例如遵守安全协议、在自助餐厅为顾客提供服务以及在中央仓库整理材料。
 这些学生还学会管理自己的时间、遵守时间表和独立旅行。
 仅上一学年，梅德福高中和研究生过渡计划的学生就为劳伦斯纪念馆社区提供了超过 85 小时的志愿者服务。
 我们想请劳伦斯纪念医院社区和一些今晚与他们一起来到这里的学生接受特殊教育家长咨询委员会颁发的奖项。
 请上来。
 您想拿着奖品到空中拍照吗？
 我们可以在所有学校委员会成员中间这样做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=1307.913s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  So I'm just going to do a short presentation, a PowerPoint presentation.
 Could John maybe adjust a little bit instead of me coming on the other side?
 Or Mia, do you want to do it?
 It just needs to be centered and the focus needs to be taken care of.
 Thank you.
 So I'm going to do a brief PowerPoint presentation, just sort of letting folks know what the Special Education Parent Advisory Council does and what we've accomplished in the past year.
 And I want to acknowledge some of our families that are here tonight and thank them for coming.
 So as you know, this is a cartoon I wanted to share with folks.
 Bill Henderson, former principal of the Henderson Public Schools and the Inclusion School, always shares this with his
 when he does his speeches.
 And I think it's just a great example of how we can all work together.
 For folks who might not be able to see it, it's a ramp, a handicap ramp and stairs, and they're all filled with snow.
 And there's a student in a wheelchair asking if the ramp can be cleared.
 And the person shoveling the steps is saying, just a minute.
 When I'm done, I'll get to that.
 And someone says, well, if you do the ramp, we can all get up.
 And it's just a really good example, I think, of how, if we work together, we can all achieve.
 So our CPAC mission, the CPAC's purpose is to fulfill the directive of Chapter 71B of the Massachusetts General Law, which requires school districts to have a PAC and assign both advisory and participatory function to the PAC.
 So our mission is to advise the districts on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with disabilities by seeking input from the special education parent members and self-advocates.
 We meet regularly with school officials, and we participate in the planning, development, and evaluation of the school's special education program.
 We also participate in planning workshops and activities.
 And I'm not sure if I introduced myself because of the award for the Lawrence Memorial Community Partnership Award, but I am the co-chair of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council.
 We have, for students with disabilities, the Medford Public Schools has 18% of students are students with disabilities.
 So that equals about one in five, and there are approximately 800 families in Medford that have students with disabilities.
 Our authority comes from the law that is required for school districts to have a PAC, and again, our mission is that we revise the school committee on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with disabilities, and we meet regularly with school officials.
 Joan Boehm, Kathy Madaglio is the Director of Pupil Services,
 was going to present with me tonight, and unfortunately, she's ill.
 So Joan Bowen, the coordinator of secondary special education, is here.
 Thanks, Joan, for coming tonight.
 And is here to answer any questions as well, if we have any.
 Right, Joan?
 Yes.
 Right.
 So here are some of our accomplishments.
 What we normally do is we meet the second Wednesday of every month from 7 to 9.
 Paul DeLeva at the Andrews Middle School is kind enough to allow us to use his school every month.
 We meet there and we host workshops or sometimes we host socials and we learn from our community what kind of workshops they want, they require.
 We are required annually to have a basic rights workshop, basic rights in special education, and that is a collaboration with the Federation for Children with Special Needs and the Medford CPAC and the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council.
 This year we also did the special education mediation process.
 and that is from a mediator from the Bureau of Special Education Appeals, Merto Flesas is a Medford mediator.
 We did agreeing to disagree with attorney Dan Heffernan of Cote and Crabtree and Strong.
 We had a great night.
 We did meet the school committee.
 Folks here might remember that.
 That was really nice, and it was a nice dialogue between the school committee and families and guardians and students of children with special needs and students with disabilities, and we were able to share what some of our needs are.
 and we're able to get some great feedback.
 Let's Get Organized was recent, and that's a workshop that actually had really good feedback, too, and we had a lot of folks from the special education department come out and help families get organized with their IEPs and their paperwork and all the 504 material, all the paperwork that can be overwhelming sometimes.
 And we had one on homework anxiety, and that was actually presented by two Medford Public Schools staff members, Angela Lepore and Lauren Kwiatkowski.
 I hope I pronounced her name right.
 And that was actually really great.
 We had some hands-on material building between the special education department and the CPAC and parents and we were able to build some tools and talk about anxiety and it was a really helpful session as well.
 We're always welcome to ideas and for professional development as well.
 If there are teachers or school committee members or special educators or general educators out there that would like a particular workshop, please let us know and we'll see what we can do.
 We also have monthly meetings with the Director of Special Education.
 We advise parents and guardians on the special education process.
 We go to meetings with the Disability Council and the Human Rights Council.
 And we go to conferences around the state, Mass Down Syndrome Conference, Federation for Children with Special Needs.
 There's a great educators conference that happens every October for general educators and special educators in Worcester.
 We attend a parent leadership series.
 and school committee meetings.
 We offer resources to families, and we also can help with conflict resolution.
 We do some public relations and media outreach, and we do public speaking if necessary.
 We interact with Program Quality Assurance and the Office of Civil Rights.
 Those are the places folks go to if they have an issue that hasn't been able to be resolved within the district.
 We meet with state legislators regarding issues concerning students with disabilities.
 That's Gracie on the State House there.
 Last year we had, a couple years ago, we had the governor sign some litigation, I mean some, sorry, not litigation, some legislation, thank you, on Down syndrome and providing updated diagnosis for individuals with Down syndrome.
 But we go to the State House pretty much every year, if it's not with the Parent Leadership Series, with the CPAC.
 Next year we're hoping to have an event at the State House that we hope you guys will join us at, where we talk a little bit about
 what different districts can need, and we hope to collaborate with folks across Massachusetts.
 We attend IEP meetings as needed, public hearing meetings as needed, and we facilitate and attend IEP or 504 meetings as needed.
 And we attend MassPAC meetings.
 MassPAC is the Massachusetts Parent Advisory Council through the Federation for Children with Special Needs.
 Our CPAC members have done things from present to the United Nations, to create employment programs for students with disabilities.
 We share our stories nationally and with legislators.
 We've presented to the associations for special educators, have met with legislators, as we said.
 And we just had a member tonight telling us that she's going to be trained on Wednesday to be a surrogate special education parent, which is really exciting, and that is
 You can be a surrogate through the Federation for Children with Special Needs for families of children who don't have representatives for their IEP.
 So for foster children or homeless children or folks who can't have supports there.
 So we have a member that's starting to do that too.
 We're excited about that.
 CPAC members are immigrants, accountants, pediatricians, attorneys, stay-at-home parents, teachers, a little bit of everybody.
 We have children with varying diagnosis, no diagnosis, mild diagnosis, moderate, and significant disabilities.
 So we wanted to talk to the school committee tonight.
 In addition to sort of what we've done for the past year, we also want to talk about one of the things we've realized in the past is that we've talked a lot about what we do, but we haven't talked a lot about
 how we can collaborate with each other and what we can do moving forward.
 And so that's really a big purpose of this presentation.
 We want to talk about what's the state of special education in Medford right now and how do we work together.
 So in the special education data that's available on the Department of Education website, and you can see on the bottom there, and maybe we can have this
 share it on the website.
 But there's a link that you can go to to look for data on your school district through the Department of Education.
 And for special education, they have indicators.
 So indicators one through, I think it's eight that we'll look at here.
 And that is sort of an idea of accountability ratings, but also how we're doing in terms of what the ratings are for special education.
 So indicator one is the graduation rate.
 And Medford is below state average for graduation rate, according
 to special education.
 So the state average is 83.4%.
 Medford is 83.4% and the state is 87.3%.
 Indicator two, dropout rate.
 We have a higher dropout rate than the state average by about 1%.
 Indicator three, participation and performance of students with IEPs on statewide assessments, MCAS.
 We did not meet the target.
 But on 3B and 3C, so on your PowerPoint,
 I want you folks to know that the bold is things that we need to work on, and the italics are things that we have met the target on.
 So that will help you decode when you're looking at it.
 The participation rate for students with IEPs on MCAS, we've matched the state rate on that.
 And the proficiency rate for students with IEPs on MCAS are also proficient.
 We've matched the state rate on that.
 Indicator four, suspension and expulsion for students with IEPs.
 We're currently below the state rate, which is great, and we have improved significantly over time, if you look at the rate from five years ago and see the decrease.
 Indicator five, educational environments for students age six to 21 with IEPs.
 So full inclusion, partial inclusion are substantially separate.
 For full inclusion, we're below the state average, and we're below by, like, around 10%.
 For partial inclusion,
 We are above for partial inclusion, and we're also above for substantially separate.
 And we're slightly above for separate schools, residential facilities, or homebound hospital placements.
 Indicator six, educational environments for students age three to five with IEPs, we're above the state average for full inclusion.
 So we're doing something really well in preschool.
 That's good to see, as well as all the other things we're doing well here.
 But it's nice to see that in the preschool level.
 For early childhood outcomes and parent involvement, also all above state average.
 Indicators nine through 14, we are all meeting the proficiency standard or above state average.
 So those are great.
 So disproportionality in special education, disproportionality in specific disability categories, initial evaluation timelines, early childhood transitions, secondary transitions,
 and post-school outcomes for students with IEPs.
 So that's the special education data based on indicators that again is available on the Department of Education's website.
 And as we know, Medford Public Schools needs, so when we ask what is the state of special education in Medford, Medford Public Schools needs technical assistance.
 So the school is, the district is considered a level three, although we have one school that's a level three and a few that are level one and a few that are level two.
 If one is labeled a level three, the Department of Education sees the district as level three.
 So that means we're seen as needing technical assistance from the State Department of Education.
 And in summary, our special education data and concerns.
 So there's a substantial achievement gap between typical students and high need students.
 We feel that that's a significant issue.
 I didn't show a slide here tonight, and I'm happy to share it with the school committee if you want to.
 where you can see typical students in a bar graph aside, students with disabilities.
 And it's substantial.
 And it's not just here.
 It is across the state.
 But it is a significant issue.
 It's the achievement gap that we have that we talk about often.
 Full inclusion rates are less than the state average.
 Dropout rates are higher than the state average.
 And substantially separate settings are higher than the state average.
 So these are our concerns.
 I want to back up a little bit to talk about, you know, the things that are great that have happened.
 And we want to make sure that we recognize things that have happened in the special education community
 that have been great, and there's a lot of indicators on there that have met proficiency, and I think that's because of a lot of hard work with Kathy Madaglio and Joan Bowen and our staff and the CPAC and the students.
 There are some things that we need to work on.
 So CPAC recommendations, we have some recommendations that we'd like to make to the school committee.
 One is the use of DSAC technical assistance accelerated improvement plan.
 So DSAC is the Department of Education's when a district needs improvement, there's a group
 called DSAC, that will come to the district and help with some technical assistance.
 And I think using that and utilizing that, especially as it pertains to students with disabilities, would be really helpful.
 We think using that and utilizing that would be really helpful.
 Some professional development, especially around students with disabilities and general educators and special educators working together to understand the needs of students with disabilities and the typical population.
 professional development around differentiated instruction and universal design for learning.
 For folks that are here, the school committee I'm sure knows, but maybe people in the audience or people watching tonight may not know that there's a new law that's been written that's replacing the No Child Left Behind Act called the Every Student Succeeds Act.
 And written into ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act, is a requirement for universal design for learning.
 So it's really important that our school district understands universal design for learning and how to implement that.
 And it's a great tool for students with disabilities, for all students, I would say.
 We recommend co-teaching and collaborative teaching.
 We had an example recently where we were at a school council meeting, and they were talking about a school improvement plan.
 And one of the things they were talking about was sort of how to differentiate math instruction.
 And one of the questions I had was, well, are you talking to your special educators?
 And the general educators and special educators working together seems like it makes a lot of sense.
 have been trained for a lot of differentiation, and I'm sure our general educators have as well, but the two of them collaborating together makes a much more powerful example, as we've seen from other schools across states.
 And cultural competency, understanding students with disabilities and students with different needs is really important for all of us.
 More recommendations, we ask that the school committee, the Medford School Committee and the Medford Public Schools create
 and or endorse an inclusion subcommittee.
 So an inclusion subcommittee might consist of inclusion facilitators, experts, consultants, school committee members, CPAC members, where we could evaluate educational environments, inclusive schools, after schools, the summer camp program that we have in Medford, and the community school program.
 There are inclusion subcommittees around the state.
 Boston Public Schools certainly created one a few years ago that was very helpful.
 I know you folks have
 subcommittees, is that what it's called here, too?
 Where we could have recommendations at the end, basically, as we talk to educators and parents across the district about what that could look like.
 We would ask that the Educator Guidebook for Inclusive Practice, which was sent
 out by the Department of Education, I think it was last year, be used with general educators and special educators.
 Kathy wanted us to mention for sure that the administrative team in Medford has reviewed the power elements for inclusive practice on the educator guidebook for inclusive practice.
 And we are seeking endorsement from the school committee in the district of this DESE advisory.
 It's available online as well for folks that want to look for it.
 So improve family and community engagement.
 Some suggestions we would have is, Superintendent Belson and I spoke about this a few months ago, and I think he agreed that it was a good idea as well, have coffee with the superintendent or school committee members.
 That could be a couple of times a year where we could have coffee with parents of students with disabilities and self-advocates and talk about what our concerns are.
 offer an opportunity for online feedback.
 I think that was mentioned in the meeting we had for the Q&A.
 Sometimes parents can't get out, and if they could give online feedback, that would be really helpful.
 Automated calls for meeting information.
 So our Special Education Parent Advisory Council has all of these great workshops, and we have these workshops for families and guardians of children with special needs, but we also have them for the educational community, for the school committee members, for anybody that wants to come.
 It's other interested parties as well.
 to come, but a lot of times they don't know about the meetings, even though they're on the district website and they're in the transcript typically or whatever, but we would recommend that a robocall once a month go out to the community, letting folks know what the workshops are.
 There are several workshops that pertain to students of all abilities.
 We already said meet with self-advocates, students with disability, consult with CPAC, publish CPAC meetings, especially workshops, and ask families to share their stories.
 One of the things that we're finding really important as we meet each other and we share our community with each other is being able to share our stories and our children's stories.
 You know, we have families here who have JoJo.
 What grade is JoJo?
 Sixth?
 Sixth grade.
 And Quinton?
 Seventh grade.
 And when we share our stories and are able to share information with folks about who we are and what our children are like and what they need and what they're great at and what they offer to the community, it brings us all closer.
 We all have a story.
 not just students with disabilities or families of students with disabilities.
 We all have a story, and it's important that we share our stories with each other.
 We're asking that CPAC recommendations that the district implement a district-wide disability awareness program.
 I'm very excited about understanding our differences.
 We're very excited about understanding our differences.
 A Newton-based public schools disability awareness organization that I believe has about 40 years experience with disability awareness, the Brooks PTO,
 and the Brooks Elementary School has offered to host a pilot program of Understanding Our Differences.
 So we just trained with the 5th grade teachers a week ago on an autism unit.
 So the great thing about Understanding Our Differences, it has 3rd, 4th and 5th grade
 small hour and a half curriculum programs around autism, intellectual disability, physical disability, blindness, deafness, allergies, all kinds of programs.
 It's a great program and we highly recommend it.
 And we're excited about that starting next year.
 And I hope you guys will come to that.
 We'll be sure to invite you.
 Review grant information related to students with disabilities.
 Endorse and offer professional development for general ed and special ed collaboration.
 Include students with disabilities and families
 and families in policy and decision making and have transparency of information.
 And then the redirection of funds.
 So when we talked earlier about grants and being able to share information on grants of students that are intended for students with disabilities, the Fund 240, which I'm sure the superintendent can talk much more about than I can, I'm not very familiar with the fund, but I know that on the Department of Education's website, especially regarding special education,
 There was an advance notice of intent to direct the use of fund code 240.
 So when a district does need technical assistance, they have up to 1% and 5% of the district's total entitlement grant is redirected by DESE into areas that DESE and perhaps the DSAC and of course the superintendent and school committee find necessary.
 So I would say perhaps some of the things that we mentioned earlier in terms of recommendations might be potentially funded by some of these things.
 Differences are what makes us beautiful.
 And I love this quote from the Medford Public Schools Director of Pupil Services, because I think oftentimes people forget this, but she certainly doesn't, which we think is a great thing.
 All students are general education students.
 Students with disability are general education students receiving special education support.
 And I think that is the end of our presentation, our PowerPoint presentation.
 I'd love to take questions and answers if folks are interested.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2590.345s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 夫人。
 范德克鲁特。
 谢谢梅兰妮的介绍。
 你给了我们很多信息，所以我正在努力快速消化它。
 我想我特别兴奋。
 引起我注意的是全区残疾人意识计划的实施。
 对我来说，这对于学生了解同龄人来说非常有意义。
 我知道在我加入学校委员会的初期，我想做这样的事情。
 我认为这对孩子们理解很有用。
 但当时最大的问题是每个人的秘密。
 如果我们的父母愿意彻底改变怎么办？
 与其他学生分享您孩子的残疾信息。
 我想不出还有什么更积极的事情了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2638.343s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 好吧，按照“了解我们的差异”计划的运作方式，我们邀请您在牛顿公立学校观察一项计划，当然，凯西和我会在明年在梅德福举办之前观察一项计划。
 我们不识别残疾学生。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2653.306s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 但即使在一般情况下，谈论像自闭症这样的残疾，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2656.911s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 拥有有意识的孩子。
 是的，一般而言。
 当然，如果家长和学生愿意，他们可以随时选择退出。
 但我们还发现，研究表明，当你谈论事情和分享信息时，不一定是关于你的诊断或你孩子的诊断，而是关于同情心和人性差异，人们真的会走到一起。
 上周，当我们进行自闭症培训时，《理解我们的差异》中的珍妮·阿科斯塔与我们的五年级老师分享了一些内容，因为出现了一些问题，看到学生真正走到一起真的很强大，而成年人往往很难走到一起。
 所以，但我认为你是对的。
 我认为将残疾学生的家长和健康学生的家长包括在内很重要。
 作为“了解我们的差异”计划的一部分，家长们自愿建立了合作伙伴关系。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2712.086s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 但我也看到过，你知道，关于教室里的孩子们曾经理解的电视故事
 他们班上某个孩子的残疾情况，他们与该孩子组成的团队。
 所以我认为这很棒。
 现在回答一个问题，关于你们的毕业率指标，我只是想问你们，梅德福是用四年毕业率还是五年毕业率。
 我们使用了 DESE 现有的一切。
 因为我认为四年对我们来说有很大的不同
 好吧，五年后。
 啊，有趣，是的。
 好吧，学生们，如果我没记错的话，我的意思是，对于某些学生来说，需要更长的时间，但这并不意味着他们不会成功。
 这实际上意味着他们非常成功并且坚持不懈，而且真的，当我们看到这一点时，我认为具体细节对于我们的整体理解很重要。
 是的，我同意。
 显然，当然。
 我想对它们进行比较。
 是的，我记不太清楚了，但我记得在某个时候我看过它并说它很有趣。
 关于您对 DSAC 支持的请求，我想：我们是否已经有 DSAC 团队或者我们在哪里？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2789.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 如果你可以问一下站长。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2790.611s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 警司先生。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2791.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 因此，我们与 DSAC 进行了会面，您知道，我们以前曾与他们合作过，并将继续与他们合作。
 他们在不同时间可以提供不同的帮助，这实际上取决于我们认为最重要的帮助。
 正如 Melanie 指出的那样，IDA 基金中有储备金，如您所知，这些储备金将转移到该领域，DSAC 也有一些资金。
 那么让我们来看看这个。
 但我认为其中一件事
 我们可能应该做的是，既然凯西今晚不能来，而且凯西还有一些其他事情想说，我们为什么不在年底之前安排一次全体委员会会议，我们可以就我们的目标进行一次良好的对话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2833.212s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 出色地。
 我认为 PAC 要求的另一件事是支持包容性并支持包容性小组委员会。
 我认为那天晚上讨论这个问题也很有价值。
 我同意这将是一个适当的后续行动。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2847.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 我认为我们显然会发生很多事情，因为正如梅兰妮指出的那样，幼儿比例正在大幅增加。
 如果我们将部分包容与完全包容结合起来，这个比例会高得多。
 那么问题是：我们如何才能实现更充分的包容？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2861.618s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 是的，正如凯西所说，如果她在这里，我认为部分纳入率可能在 79% 到 21% 之间。
 所以这是一个很大的差距。
 大窗户。
 是的，是的。
 所以，我认为看到这一点很重要。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2875.688s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 哦，我刚刚注意到的最后一件事是机器人电话。
 看来我们应该能够在自动通话中包含 PAC 会议信息
 你知道，它可能是一个独立的搭配，也可能是同时宣布其他事情的东西。
 所以我当然认为我们应该为此努力。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2898.592s">[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>: 谢谢。
 非常感谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2901.167s">[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>: 贝内代托先生。
 谢谢。
 嗯，我不知道你们是否都知道这一点，但我的日常工作是剑桥萨默维尔一所特许学校的特殊教育协调员。
 这就是为什么我非常清楚父母可以一起做些什么。
 在我们学校，我们恳请家长们站出来做这样的工作。
 这是一项非凡的工作，你们都应该为此感到自豪。
 但这个房间应该已经满了。
 如果有800个家庭，那就应该是，
 这里还有很多人。
 我希望这是因为他们在家里和孩子们在一起，读书，帮助他们做作业，做很多事情，或者因为他们只是度过了一个艰难的夜晚，而你是他们的代表。
 因为你所做的工作是非凡的。
 我们也需要向他们传达信息。
 我知道那是什么感觉，因为我在高中时曾担任 PTO 副总裁，他们将是做这项工作的人。
 所以别累了。
 不要放弃。
 继续。
 这是一项非凡的工作。
 我印象非常深刻。
 我也很高兴看到技术援助的使用，视觉效果中的加速改进计划，因为我是一个视觉学习者。
 所以这对我来说非常有用。
 我将向主管询问我们目前正在做什么以及我们正在与他们合作为小组委员会会议做准备的信息，以便我们了解。
 我们具体关注哪些领域？
 我正在做出改变，使我们的学区不再是三级学区。
 这句话我已经说了一年了，现在我已经厌倦了。
 我不喜欢。
 对我来说很无聊。
 我们在整个社区做了出色的工作。
 我们需要确保我们教育所有学生。
 我还要感谢您给我机会参加一些会议。
 我不做
 我想要多少就多少。
 但我真的很喜欢琐事之夜。
 我能够与父母建立联系，并真正与他们讨论出现的不同问题。
 我一眼就认得人，尽管我不知道名字。
 现在我通过参加这些会议认识了他的一些孩子。
 所以这是我需要并感激的联系。
 我希望看到我们中有更多人在这种情况下与您合作。
 如果这个团体需要我提供任何东西，我的门是敞开的，我欢迎评论或建议，或者如果他们需要我们向他们展示东西。
 我在这里以敢于发声而闻名，我不介意在社区中为家长和学生挺身而出。
 当我在这个领域工作时，我觉得这就是我的专长所在。
 请随意介绍一下自己，并再次感谢我们的所有时间和奉献。
 我知道你很好地领导了这个团队。
 我知道你和我们的管理员合作得很好。
 我们需要保持这些门敞开并再次表示感谢。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3075.077s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 夫人。
 Cugno，谢谢梅兰妮给我们带来这个。
 你今晚通过 PowerPoint 设置的方式，对你和所有参与此工作的人来说，干得很好。
 这是一种详细了解所有内容的绝佳方式。
 我不会浪费时间，因为我知道每个人都非常累。
 我想重申我的同事们所说的话，但我正在回顾一些事情，在成就方面，我知道你们参加了许多“参与育儿领导力”系列活动。这是其他家长可以参与的事情吗？
 这是他们花钱买的东西吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3109.575s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 不，您知道，马萨诸塞州变革组织育儿领导系列是一个非常好的计划，并且免费向家庭提供。
 残疾学生的家庭、亲属。
 所以你可以是一个姐妹，你可以是一个兄弟，你可以是一个父亲，你可以是任何这样的人。
 并过夜。
 所以是周五和周六，每月一次，持续三个月。
 而且酒店、吃饭什么的都是付费的。
 最后参观其总部，将活动推向高潮。
 您会与所有立法者会面，并与他们讨论您的担忧。
 这里有一些来自“大众家庭组织变革家长领导力”系列的应届毕业生。
 他们可以说这是一个非常棒的计划。
 而且资金充足。
 它是完全免费的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3152.268s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 父亲怎么知道这一点？
 我的意思是，是因为他们参加会议或发送新闻通讯吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3158.131s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 我们尽力传播信息。
 注册时间为一月。
 然后，当收到订单时，我们会将其发布在 Facebook 页面上。
 我们尝试通知家人。
 我们当然已经通知了我们的 CPAC 成员。
 我们很乐意与您、朋友们、选民们分享。
 这是一个非常好的程序，因为它是免费的。
 他们唯一要求的是你参加这四个项目。
 夫妻可以一起去。
 真的很酷。
 对于家庭成员来说，这也是一个很好的喘息来源，因为他们有育儿补助金，如果你需要一些钱来照顾孩子，他们可以给你。
 这是一个很棒的节目。
 这是哪里？
 他们在伯灵顿组织这个活动，但该组织名为 MFOFC。
 所以首字母缩略词是 MassFamiliesOrganizingForChange.org。
 他们有区域性的。
 我们是梅尔罗斯协调员。
 事实上，洛里·梅代罗斯也是梅德福的协调员之一。
 您在伯灵顿的伯灵顿万豪酒店组织了这次会议吗？
 沃本，沃本。
 沃本。
 是的。
 是的。
 很有趣。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3226.912s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 只是出于好奇，作为一名父母，比如说，他的孩子有残疾，并且不知道 Facebook 或如何开始使用。
 你如何让他们来找你？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3240.524s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 嗯，首先，我想说，当然是通过我们学校委员会的成员，我们会要求如果有人联系你，请让他们知道我们，以便他们可以随时联系我们。
 它是 medfordcpac.yahoo.com。
 雅虎网站，我们有 Facebook 页面，但您当然可以拨打我们的电话号码。
 而且每个月的第二个星期三我们总是从 7 点到 9 点在安德鲁斯高中见面。
 明年我们希望有一些咖啡时间，也许还有一些家庭早晨聚会。
 我们从家人那里得到了一些反馈，艾琳，深夜睡觉对他们来说很困难，这让一切都变得困难。
 晚上，家人可能会外出，所以早上放学后送他们可能是另一种选择。
 我们想说，无论如何我想说，养育一个孩子，一个残疾学生，是极端的养育方式，就像极限运动一样。
 所以，你知道，有时离开会有点困难。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3293.571s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 不，我完全理解。
 我认为这将是凯西的问题，但由于她不在这里，从市长到总监，当孩子在我们区并且有特殊需要时，他们会收到包含所有这些信息的数据包吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3314.051s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 他们做到了。
 贝尔森警长，您介意我回应吗？或者您愿意吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3319.115s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 只要有人回答这个问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3322.557s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 好的。
 十月，特殊教育主任凯西·梅达里奥（Kathy Medaglio）发送了一个包含指南、家长指导和家长权利的数据包。
 此外，他们还发送了一份日历，其中包含我们为明年选择的 CPAC 活动。
 以及如何联系我们的信息。
 我们还正在制作一些小册子。
 我们还在社区日设立了餐桌，但这是肯定的。
 而且，每次一个人参加 IEP 会议、每次家庭参加 IEP 会议时，他们都应该在 IEP 会议期间获取有关特殊教育家长咨询委员会的信息。
 因此，家长让我们知道，有时是，有时不是，但评估小组领导应该分享有关 CPAC 的信息，以便他们能够了解我们。
 但谢谢你的提醒。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3369.073s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 不，我只是想确保每个人都做得如此出色，而且总是一样的，你知道，正如我的同事刚才所说，有时候，当他们跑来发送消息并要求父母来时，这有点困难，不幸的是，情况并非总是如此，你知道，这几乎是，你知道，我不想这样做。
 我不想听起来像晚上的主管，你知道，学区里有这么多家长，但不幸的是，你只有一小群家长。
 所以，话虽如此，来到这里，成为学校委员会的成员，拥有更多的人，也许写博客，类似的事情，你只是希望并祈祷口碑传播得越来越多。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3412.336s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 我想我们已经明白了，夫人。
 Cunha，就像你一样，人们可以在需要我们时找到我们。
 所以大多数时候，人们来到，
 CPAC 会议或有任何问题时联系我。
 但事实是，如果您提前与我们会面，可能不会有任何问题。
 这是检查的好方法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3428.868s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 但不幸的是，有时你没有时间，直到它从背后击中你。
 是的，我知道。
 我要问的另一件事是建议。
 您问及职业发展。
 您是否要求家长或相关人员、教师、工作人员获得更专业的发展？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3446.449s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 我们想说，对于教师和工作人员来说，专业发展，特别是围绕普通教育和特殊教育之间的合作，我们发现工作非常分开。
 正如你所看到的，他们合作得越多，我认为与佩雷拉博士和里奇奥博士以及他们在高中所做的事情，合作的人越多，结果就越好。
 我们发现，不仅我们发现，而且研究表明，当残疾学生与典型同龄人一起在普通教育课堂上接受教育时，
 有研究表明，数学成绩不仅对于残疾学生而且对于一般学生来说都有所提高。
 对于这种做法有各种各样的研究。
 但它必须做得好。
 如果做得不好，可能会适得其反。
 我认为这对于教育工作者和工作人员的专业发展非常重要。
 我的意思是，我们的系统中仍然有很多人几年前生活在一个完全不同的系统中，当时事情的运作方式非常不同，人们也非常隔离。
 所以我考虑更新人员。
 我教授关于残疾意识的课程。
 作为 Mass Ark 行动 Housecall 的一部分，在塔夫茨医疗中心进行。
 我们教医生。
 医院里没有任何东西可以让医生了解残疾情况。
 所以这不仅仅是学校的问题。
 它在所有平台上都有。
 老实说，除非你所爱的人有残疾，否则这个问题不会出现。
 对我来说当然不是这样的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3523.965s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 好的。
 我认为每个人都理解这一点很重要。
 我知道参与此事的父母都明白这一点。
 孩子的需求是非常不同的。
 即使一个孩子有 IEP，它也可能与另一个有 IEP 的孩子完全不同。
 作为经历过这个过程的家长，我可以诚实地说，这绝对是一个学习的过程。
 我想我非常感谢我们的团队。
 这与我担任学校委员会成员无关。
 但它确实做得非常好。
 不幸或幸运的是，这就是我学到的。
 我是听父母的话才学会的。
 就像你说的，有时你不想谈论某些事情，因为你觉得，好吧，也许其他人不想听到它们。
 或者也许你觉得也许你是，你知道，
 您孩子的残疾并不像其他人那样严重或重要。
 但事实并非如此。
 当你敞开心扉并开始谈论它时，你的学习方式和经历的过程将会令人惊奇。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3594.811s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 确实如此。
 我还认为人们会记住残疾是自然的。
 你知道，有一天我们都会成为残疾人。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3601.432s">[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>: 好的。
 再说一次，你知道，永远在你的孩子身边，告诉他们我们可以尽力解决这个问题。
 但我想推荐并感谢大家的工作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3630.437s">[Jameel Webb-Davis]</a>: 好的，那么有几点。
 我的名字是贾米尔·韦伯·戴维斯，我的儿子是昆汀·戴维斯，他正在上六年级，即将进入七年级。
 他患有自闭症。
 他患有高功能自闭症。
 他们告诉我这个，他们问我，你确定他患有自闭症吗？
 他看上去没那么自闭。
 我收到这样的评论。
 所以我的努力​​是试图让人们相信他需要的支持比人们想要给他的更多。
 我只是想说，当我参与 CPAC 时，是我得到学区最多关注并为我儿子寻求帮助的时候。
 我的意思是，我来 CPAC 不是因为我遇到了问题。
 我刚刚注意到，当我参加 CPAC 会议时，我在下一次 IEP 会议上受到了更多关注。
 令人遗憾的是事情就是这样发生的。
 随着我更多地参与社区并更多地出现，我从儿子那里得到了更多的支持。
 我想到所有其他无法参加这些活动并且由于某种原因无法参加的父母。
 我还有另一个孩子，我的儿子，我认识另一位母亲，她有两个患有自闭症的孩子，她总是和其中一个孩子一起住院，因为他总是癫痫发作。
 您不能顺便参加 CPAC 会议。
 我想，他是如何获得支持的？
 因为他无法出现并试图说服这个地区。
 我认为这是人们应该考虑的事情。
 有很多家长因为各种原因不能来。
 他们将如何获得支持？
 另一个问题是该地区的透明度。
 我觉得父母的透明度不够高。
 我感觉区里有节目。
 这种情况发生了两次。
 该地区有一些项目非常适合我儿子，但我对此一无所知。
 我是通过其他 CPAC 妈妈，或者通过在梅德福工作的治疗师，或者通过另一个孩子发现了它们，他说，哦，你知道我们在高中做这件伟大的事情吗？
 学生不必告诉我或其他家长有关学区计划的信息。
 我应该从我的团队、我的个别化教育计划团队那里了解更多关于他们的信息。
 他们应该告诉我梅德福针对自闭症儿童的项目，无论是否适合他们。
 所以你应该知道这一点，我们应该进行一次健康的讨论，哦，不，这不起作用或它确实有效。
 但你必须意识到。
 在我的儿子被学校停学六次之后，我不应该去了解该学区的项目。
 事情就是这样发生的。
 这是我最大的问题。
 这就是我的意思。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3757.637s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 谢谢。
 谢谢贾米尔。
 所以，谢谢贾米尔。
 贾米尔也是一位父亲，刚刚自愿成为无家可归儿童和寄养儿童家庭的养父母，最近刚刚从育儿领导力系列课程毕业，但也
 CPAC 今年与特殊教育部门一起做的一件事是，这些项目现在出现在学区网站上。
 这是个好消息。
 这是 Jameel 加入我们的 CPAC 的优势之一。
 所以这是张贴在那里。
 重要的是，人们拥有所有信息才能做出明智、健康的决策。
 我认为最好的事情之一就是让我对这个地区和我们的未来感到兴奋。
 是我们正在进行这些对话。
 我认为我们已经很久没有这样做了，而且我认为这样非常重要，所以它非常健康。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3810.356s">[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>: 谢谢。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4017.357s">[F9BRnpGt19U_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 晚上好，学校委员会成员、伯克市长和贝尔森警监。
 感谢您允许我今晚发言。
 我会尽量简短。
 嗯，所以我今晚就在这里，呃，我一直想来谈论这个话题一段时间了。
 这是我在学校系统工作的三年里以及在与学校系统中其他家长的许多很多谈话中不断谈论的事情。
 嗯，这是一个让很多家长非常沮丧的话题，那就是，嗯，
 课间休息政策，或者更确切地说，我们学区的小学缺乏课间休息政策。
 因此，最近几次我听到纳尔逊讲话，我听到他谈论对教育整个孩子的承诺，我绝对认为我们可以通过很多方法在这里成功地做到这一点。
 我们在康纳先生身上看到了这一点。
 我是罗伯茨的父亲。
 我相信康纳先生是
 我们非常感谢你们为我们学校社区带来的一切，不仅是音乐，还有楼外美丽的花朵。
 在我们的艺术之夜，谢丽尔·罗德里格斯主持了一场艺术之夜，我们看到了孩子们在学校创作的令人惊叹的艺术。
 梅德福在很多方面取得了成功，我对这里的很多事情感到非常满意。
 但课间休息时我发现我们只有15分钟的休息时间。
 在我们的小学，这是不够的。
 不仅如此，我们经常发现，由于不做作业、违规、违反课堂纪律以及其他原因（例如课程持续时间太长而简单地中断课间休息），我们正在努力避免课间休息被部分或全部剥夺。
 所以今晚我要问的基本上是
 一项全面的政策，因为当我开始解决这个问题时，我联系了黛安考德威尔，询问她政策是什么。
 因为一些家长有一种感觉，有一项书面政策规定，只有在担心伤害孩子或他们自己，或者孩子可能伤害其他学生的情况下，才能取消这种休息时间。
 事实证明这不是真的。
 黛安引导我查阅《罗伯茨手册》，其中有一些模糊的信息，
 描述校长是否认为应该让孩子离开课间休息或类似的情况。
 今晚我没有去找它。
 但目前还不太清楚这到底意味着什么。
 当黛安寄给我罗伯茨手册时，我清楚地意识到，在这个问题上没有学区范围内的政策。
 所以我的建议是，如果你研究一下课间休息对孩子的好处，就会发现很多东西。
 但我认为最
 当然是来自美国儿科学会。
 你们中的一些人可能熟悉他 2013 年 6 月关于休会的声明。
 但如果没有，对于那些在家里或其他地方观看的人，我想快速谈谈该声明中的几点。
 首先，美国儿科学会认为，课间休息是儿童发育中至关重要且必要的组成部分。
 因此，不应保留它。
 出于惩罚或学术原因。
 所以美国儿科学会基本上说这不应该发生。
 课间休息代表着从严格的认知任务中进行的必要的有计划的休息。
 它提供了休息、玩耍、想象、思考、活动和社交的时间。
 我想指出的是，我经常发现我的困难之一是理解什么是课间休息以及它对于一个有很多工作人员的孩子意味着什么。
 有时，课间休息似乎是对孩子们的一种惩罚，所以他们必须从一个地方走到另一个地方。
 他们说，好吧，他们仍然可以移动自己的身体。
 但这份清单表明，课间休息不仅仅是活动身体，它实际上是玩耍和进行非结构化活动的时间。
 课间休息后，学生们变得更加专注。
 并且能够更好地进行认知工作。
 此外，课间休息还可以帮助孩子们培养社交技能，而这些技能是在更加结构化的课堂环境中无法获得的。
 我必须补充一点，当我还是个 70 年代的孩子时，我放学后的时间都用来跑步
 和附近的几个人。
 现在这样的情况已经少多了。
 我们都知道这一点。
 我的意思是，幸运的是，我没有听说梅德福有人看到孩子走在街上时报警。
 但我们知道，很多时候在操场上，尤其是在 Title I 学校，孩子们无法参加其他孩子拥有的一些体育项目，我认为这一次向所有孩子们承诺社交、想象、休息、移动、思考、社交等，这一点非常重要。
 课间休息时玩耍。
 所以，游戏只是一种手段。
 这不是休会的唯一目标，我认为这是另一个目标。
 行政人员、工作人员和教师有时认为课间休息是一段有趣的时光。
 有趣的时间是可选的。
 这就像一个小型聚会，很容易被带走，因为它对我们在学校的一天并不重要。
 我想说相反。
 通过游戏，孩子们学习宝贵的沟通技巧，包括谈判、合作、分享、
 和解决问题的能力，以及毅力和自我控制等应对技能。
 因此，虽然阅读和写作显然对我们人类未来的生活非常重要，但我想说，每个人可能都会同意，这些技能在经营企业或工作时是最重要的。
 如果可以合作洽谈。
 这些技能是你无法通过坐下来做普通的基础数学来学到的。
 您将在运动场上学习它们。
 和你的其他孩子。
 基于大量科学研究，出于惩罚性或学业原因而中断课间休息似乎会与预期结果适得其反，并且在孩子获得这些重要的生活技能时可能会产生意想不到的后果。
 所以，就像我说的，课间休息通常被认为是有趣的或者只是活动身体的时间。
 从 AAP 中你可以看出，他们对课间休息的真正定义远不止于此。
 这就是我希望看到在所有小学中反映出来的政策，这样这就不再是一场家长与老师、校长与校长、学校与学校之间的战斗。
 它必须由我们的梅德福学校委员会制定。
 我忘记了我要找的词。
 学校行政部门。
 所以，第一。
 我的第一点是，我希望看到这项政策得到实施，以便每所学校的每个人都清楚，课间休息对于孩子的日常生活与数学、艺术和音乐一样重要。
 当孩子们学习一些东西时，这是非常宝贵的时间。
 就像我说的，我经常很难理解休息的定义。
 因此，我认为教师可能需要支持来理解什么是课间休息以及寻找方法
 纠正不良行为或在不中断课间休息的情况下做作业。
 我不知道。
 我没有时间研究我们的社会情感程序是什么。
 我不知道梅德福是否使用响应式教室。
 但我知道，在反应灵敏的课堂上，惩罚或者我想说的纠正措施通常与孩子的行为有关。
 所以任务与任务有一定的关系。
 你知道，课程中断与此有关。
 因此，让他们在课间休息时在教学楼周围走五分钟并不总是那么简单。
 他们只有 15 个，所以还剩下 10 个。
 很多时候，你知道，在冬天穿上外套或类似的东西，甚至比这还少。
 因此，我希望看到我们的员工和教师在这个主题上得到一些支持和培训。
 另一方面，我经常发现孩子们呆在室内。
 在寒冷的日子里，我并不总是认为有必要。
 如果他们能多出去走走，即使天气很冷，那就太好了。
 最后，就像我说的，我们每天只有 15 分钟的休息时间。
 在询问其他学区的家长时，我发现很多学校每天有两次课间休息。
 其中一些有 25 分钟的休息时间。
 然后他们有25分钟的休息时间和15分钟的休息时间。
 正如你所看到的，我认为梅德福在这个问题上有点落后。
 所以我的第三个要求是我们展望未来，看看如何重新安排我们的一天。
 我知道老师和类似的事情存在工会时间问题。
 但所有其他似乎有较长课间时间的学校都有较长的上课时间，例如周一、周二、周四、周五，然后周三的上课时间较短。
 因此，一天中还剩下一些时间来度过这些休闲时刻。
 基本上就是这样，我的演示。
 高层有一个明确的政策，说明休息的重要性、休息的定义，并提醒员工，真正取消休息应该是最后的手段，而不是我和这里许多其他家长认为的公共手段。
 教师在一种包容性的课堂中接受支持和培训，使他们能够拥有找到这种替代方案的工具。
 我经常听说课间休息是我唯一的事情。
 我觉得我们可能会找到别的东西。
 就像我说的，第三，长期愿景也许能找到一种获得更多休息时间的方法。
 我认为，最终，正如他们所说，学生更加专注并且具有更好的认知能力。
 因此，当我们努力提高 MCAS 分数和其他事情时，孩子们白天休息的时间越多，他们学得就越好。
 这对我们学区来说会更好。
 所以谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4627.673s">[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>: 非常感谢你，埃琳娜。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4634.523s">[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>: 您好，非常感谢您提出这个问题。
 今年我们已经不是第一次听到这样的消息了。
 我认为至少是第三个。
 我们最近见过面，家长们在委员会会议上向我们提出了这个问题。
 甚至最近，当我们审查小学预算时，出现了这些问题。
 我当时的理解（现在仍然如此）是，暂停休会只是作为最后的手段。
 而且你必须有至少三个不同的记录事件，其中学生无法及时完成他们的作业，这就是你所拥有的。
 但必须有记录才能接受案件。
 现在我要通过市长、总监请你澄清这一点。
 在我们的委员会会议上，在哥伦布学校演讲期间的预算会议上，我特别询问了有关课间休息的问题，以及孩子们应该始终享有所有课间休息的问题。
 他们告诉我，我们有一项政策，必须为父母记录三遍。
 孩子还没做作业，他们会在此之前取消课间休息。
 所以我想问这是否存在，如果存在，我们是否应该将其作为一项政策写入并放入我们所有的小学教科书中？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4727.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 这就是政策。
 你知道，有时你有一个政策，但并不是每个人都以同样的方式实施它。
 这就是问题所在。
 这是不久前我们在课程小组委员会上进行的一次讨论，我相信您也参加了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4741.966s">[F9BRnpGt19U_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，关于家庭作业，是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4743.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 是的，你当时就在那里。
 你知道，我们当时进行了这样的讨论。
 而且，你知道，我们回到大楼并告诉他们，该政策是我们的政策，我们必须遵守它。
 当年轻人行为不端或工作不顺利时，有些老师就会瘫痪，这还不够。
 他们滥用这项政策。
 我们必须阻止这一切。
 我们不希望他们这样做。
 整个休会问题并不是一个新问题。
 我们已经多次讨论过这个问题。
 我们对时间和学习的要求有点不知所措。
 梅德福的上学时间不像其他地方那么长。
 我们需要满足国家 900 小时的要求。
 而且休息时间不算在内。
 你知道，这是我们的背水一战。
 但还有其他促进锻炼的方法，还有其他我们可以考虑的做事方式，而且我们肯定会考虑。
 当年轻人搬家时，也许可以通过多种方式进行主动学习。
 最近出版了一本书，叫Spark。
 不知道大家有没有见过年轻人一边学习一边站起来、走动的样子。
 而且这也是一种很好的锻炼方式。
 但破坏是一个重要问题。
 没有人愿意否认这一点。
 但有一些问题我们必须解决。
 我们不希望我们的教师以此作为惩罚。
 几年前我们在写作时也遇到过同样的问题，其中
 有些老师把写作作为惩罚。
 我们说过，我们不希望孩子们认为写作是一种惩罚。
 我们希望人们认为写作是他们喜欢并喜欢做的事情。
 那么让我们努力吧。
 我们当然需要对此进行更多讨论。
 显然，我要穿过入口。
 让我们看看在我们的行政会议上我们是否能想出一些办法来充实克莱恩女士提出的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4859.119s">[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>: 所以此时，我想提出一项动议，将我们的政策纳入所有小学教科书和我们的网站，以便我们的管理人员、我们的老师和我们的家长了解学校的政策是什么，如果人们不遵守它，它可以成为他们改进计划或上级评估的一部分。
 整个学区每个人的行为都一致，没有学校的行为与其他学校不同。
 所以我在地板上做了一个动作。
 我需要一点时间。
 第二。
 请致电。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4896.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 嗯，你知道，我们的网站上当然有这个。
 让我们让它更加突出。
 我们将在行政会议上再次向董事们强调这一点。
 这将在学校结束时发生。
 并且我们会做更多
 明确以人民为优先，如果人们滥用这一政策，这一点就不会被忽视。
 这就是我们对政治所能做的一切。
 现在，相对于其他措施，这已经是一个讨论。
 考虑到时间限制和学习限制以及我们必须根据国家要求做的所有其他事情，我们需要考虑对此能做些什么。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4933.613s">[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>: 与此同时，您能否向所有校长发送通知，以便他们将其转交给老师？
 但这不是惩罚的时刻吗？

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4948.531s">[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>: 是否有政策规定，在孩子错过课间休息之前，家长会收到三份书面通知？</p>

 一段时间后，然后就被遗忘了，但至少是暂时的。
 我不断地听到它。
 我认为我们确信我们的政策是例外，非常例外。
 这不应该是你经常做的事情，但我不断听到它，所以显然我们有一个持续存在的问题。
 我想知道，学监先生，你刚才说的一件事是课间休息，部分问题是课间休息不是时间和学习的一部分。
 DESC 并不认为这很重要，也许我们应该做的是写
 今年，我们向 MASC 提出动议，并开始倡导将课间休息时间视为我们在谈论整个孩子时的重要性。
 这将是梅德福学校委员会可以讨论并带到州一级的积极事项。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5047.9s">[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>: 您想以动议的形式提出吗？</p>

 总监先生，关于第 17 财年国家预算的报告。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5544.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 各位委员会成员下午好。
 州长提出了 2017 年预算。
 众议院和参议院随后批准了他们的版本，预算现已提交会议委员会。
 会议委员会必须调和两院之间的立法分歧，而当会议委员会报告时（通常需要本月的大部分时间），两院都会进行上下表决。
 如果两院都通过，则在离开会议委员会后，两院不得进行修改。
 它将交给州长，他肯定会根据自己的喜好否决一些项目。
 然后，它将返回立法机关，以寻求可能的否决权，这是典型的做法。
 然后最终版本将送交州长颁布。
 这一过程可能要到六月底才能完成。
 你必须现实地看待这种情况是如何发生的。
 这是一个典型的状态过程。
 如果有的话，这种情况通常要到六月的最后一周才会发生。
 因此，谈判是在 2016 年收入不确定的情况下开始的。
 现在，当我撰写这份报告时，预计落后 2.6 亿美元。
 前几天，这一预测升至 3.11 亿美元，低于预期。
 现在，行政和财政部长克里斯汀·莱波雷（Kristen Lepore）表示，他们可以在州一级处理这个问题。
 但这阻碍了立法室中的这种思考，因为他们对自己说，好吧，如果我们现在落后3.11亿美元，那么到6月份我们会落后多少？
 这对于转入 2017 财年的资金意味着什么？
 所以我们仍然不知道这将如何发生。
 迄今为止提出的总体预算水平如下。
 州长的薪酬为 39,553,000 美元。
 众议院落后州长 39,539,000 美元。
 参议院的拨款为 39,558,000 美元。
 因此，参议院的地位通常较高。
 它通常位于众议院和参议院之间。
 总体涨幅约为3.59%。
 参议院是最高权力机构。
 根据马萨诸塞州纳税人基金会的数据，最初的收入预测率为 4.3%。
 然而，从现在到4月份，只有1.9%。
 这与该州预期的收入存在很大差距。
 总体而言，众议院和参议院对基础教育提供类似的支持。
 但这 30 项之间存在差异，必须加以协调。
 我将向您提供一些具有代表性的差异，因为我认为它们会影响我们准备预算并向前推进的过程。
 我知道每个人都感兴趣的一件事是 K-12 住房拨款为 1850 万美元。
 这就是今年的资金水平。
 参议院是，这是一个错误，参议院是200万美元。
 对不起。
 参议院有200万美元。
 这一水平的任何减少都会影响梅德福幼儿园的直接资金。
 该金额最高可达 150,000 美元。
 如果参议院级别达到或低于我们收到的水平，我们可能会损失高达 150,000 美元。
 这不好。
 特许学校的资金仍然远远低于抵消两个分校的当地成本的公式。
 参议院比众议院高500万。
 但它们都没有真正解决资金不足的补贴可能接近 5000 万美元的实际缺口。
 根据早期结果，预计梅德福特许学校的学生人数会减少，但我们今年最终可能会支付更多费用，因为这就是资金的运作方式。
 如果你的退款减少了，那就是个问题了。
 参议院将为非居民学生提供 180 万美元的资助，比众议院多出 150 万美元。
 融资额度有助于抵消民兵巴士的成本。
 现在，我们正在努力降低这款特定车辆的成本，因为我们的年轻人较少。
 也许我们可以使用较小的车辆并支付更少的费用。
 但是，我们希望获得这笔退款，因为这显然有助于抵消成本。
 参议院版本拨款 35 万美元作为一项新拨款，用于支持开发除考试成绩之外的学生表现替代评估。
 这是一个愿望。
 我不知道我们是否会看到很多这样的内容，但这是一个有趣的提议。
 可以说，参议院利用预算程序对政治问题进行立法，而众议院却没有这么做。
 这是一条非常复杂的道路，因为这意味着参议院必须说服众议院应该通过预算来立法政策。
 州长在这个特定时间避免了这种情况。
 那么让我们看看会发生什么。
 参议院版本的 SPED 断路器的成本比众议院版本高出约 500 万美元，比州长版本高出约 1000 万美元。
 这条融资线补偿了特殊教育的巨大成本。
 我们预计该州需要约 2.83 亿美元来抵消成本并达到 75% 的报销率。
 就今天而言，这对我们来说每年价值在 1.45 至 150 万美元之间。
 如果减少，我们就必须在预算中找到这笔钱。
 我们不认为它会减少，我们只是不知道它是否会达到75%，因为每年越来越多的年轻人需要照顾，这些安置的成本会增加，差距也会扩大。
 这些是影响梅德福的主要差异。
 根据第 70 章，众议院和参议院均向学校提供了每名学生 55 美元的最低额外援助。
 这比州长为每个学生多了 35 美元。
 每个学生比去年多了 30 美元。
 这笔一般资金直接进入市财政，显然用于城市需要支付其开支的多种原因，包括医疗保健、养老金和影响学校的其他问题，但它可能不会经常出现在我们的预算中。
 自 2016 财年起，我们一直为无家可归者提供交通资助。
 这远远低于需要。
 根据过去的经验，帕特和我现在预计明年的成本可能为 140,000 美元。
 在退款方面我们不会接近这个水平。
 这是一项据称没有资金支持的任务，州审计员表示将获得资金支持，但目前尚未达到他的预期。
 这就是我们定期致电立法者的原因。
 我今天在众议院呆了一段时间，再次与我们的一些工作人员交谈，但坦率地说，你知道，很难知道会议委员会正在发生什么，直到他们真正认真对待它以及权衡将是什么，因为国家预算中有太多项目。
 如果有人得到一件事，他们可以给予另一件事，但他们知道我们想要什么。
 他们当然知道我们想要什么。
 我们当然有，
 与我们有相同需求的其他学区的支持。
 这是迄今为止国家预算的一项更新。
 它肯定会影响我们计划预算的方式，因为当我们的预算到达时，我们不会知道其中一些答案。
 因此，我们可能不得不推迟做出某些决定，直到我们知道某些项目的实际国家资助是多少。
 但如果未来几天有任何情况发生，我们会及时通知您并提供更多信息。</p>

 关于公共记录法案的报告。
 简介一下，先生。抱歉，财务报告。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6001.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 因此，在本财年即将结束时，我们将请财务和行政总监帕特·费利 (Pat Feely) 向您通报我们的最新财务状况。</p>

 随附 6 月 1 日的财务报告摘要。
 截至撰写本报告时，预算已支出 85.69%。
 受雇 10 个月的教师的最后一次工资将于 6 月 16 日开始支付。
 这是最后一份正常工资了。
 然后6月21日是学校的最后一天，我们将查看最后四张工资单以完成合同所欠的26天。
 这是针对那些已经工作了 10 个月的人的。
 目前，有六名教师正在休产假。
 特殊教育将使用预期预算。
 预算资源为 350 万美元。
 我们目前的税率为 1.95 美元。
 普通基金，想法，大约一百万美元。
 断路器，1.4 美元。
 随着我们临近年底并做出最终调整，这些数字将会发生一些变化。
 电话，所有学校都配备了新电话。
 唯一的问题是我们的防火墙。
 正如艾伦·阿雷纳 (Alan Arena) 在全体委员会中提到的那样，
 事实证明这是非常有问题的。
 所以我们正在研究解决方案。
 艾伦明天将与 Network Technology 会面，尝试整合解决方案。
 春季期间，交通和巴士路线运行良好。
 最后一天的课程，6 月 21 日，将提前放出。
 东方已经接到通知。
 直到比赛的最后一天我们还没有决定。
 我们仍在就此做出决定。
 使用 Transfinder 软件进行路线审查正在进行中。
 下一步是与东方航空交谈，审查调查结果，并做出其他决定以改进 MPS 路线。
 公用事业。
 4 月份，天然气仍比预算低 25% 左右。
 众所周知，比典型的冬季温暖意味着使用量减少。
 节省下来的费用将有助于降低维护成本。
 电费比预算高出约 4.5%。
 这是预料之中的，我们将预算定为 118 万美元来实现这一目标。
 已向建筑物提供信息以及审查我们预计不会增加的建筑物的原因，他们正在调查这些建筑物并试图审查正在发生的情况。
 在这些建筑物中，它可以忽略不计，但如果在我们正常的冬季不削减它，这可能是一个真正的问题。
 我们与市政府签订了新合同。
 新的供电电价为0.0882。
 目前的费率为 0.0941，即每千瓦时节省不到 0.01 美元。
 节省的资金约为 70,000 美元，这将有助于维持我们明年 118 万美元的预算。
 自 4 月 22 日起，向普通基金提出请求的能力已暂停，赠款和循环基金以及维护紧急情况除外。
 在 6 月剩余时间和 7 月前两周，将支付已批准采购订单的发票。
 除非发生不可预见的事件，否则根据 2016 财年预算，本年度应按计划结束。
 问题？</p>

 贝内代托先生。
 谢谢。
 帕特，非常感谢您的报告。
 这非常有用。
 我真的很喜欢看到它，因为我看到了总价值，以及每年每个部门的分配。
 我们花费的金额和数量总是让我感到惊讶
 资金如何分配给不同部门。
 现在，我知道这对我很有帮助，因为我非常不自在，尤其是在预算即将到来的情况下。
 我发现有些部门没有其他部门那么多的资金。
 我们的外语费用不到100万美元，但我们的经费却有150万美元。
 我知道那里为儿童提供更多服务。
 但当人们在预算会议上向我提出很多要求时，这对我很有帮助。
 把它放在我面前。
 所以我只想说谢谢，我真的用得很好。
 迈克，给我们这个，这是季度报告吗？
 每次我做演讲时我都会分发它们。
 好的。
 是每月吗？
 几乎是每月一次。
 然后，我们现在将每季度开设社区学校。
 赛道什么时候提供餐饮服务？
 我们可以制定财务报告的时间表，以便您准确地知道我们将提前收到明年全年的哪些报告吗？
 然后我就会知道每三个月我会收到社区学校和赛道费用。
 季刊。
 那么它们会每季度添加一次吗？
 季刊。
 好的，太好了。
 这将是每月一次。
 好的。
 是的，好的。
 我只是想确定一下。
 我知道我们已经提出了这项动议，并且是最近提交给我们的。
 但您可能希望了解我们何时收到这些报告以及我们将在哪些月份收到每份报告。
 因为我认为有时在年底我们拿到预算书时，里面有所有这些东西。
 它还将有赛道，并将有我们所有的建筑物、所有的设施和所有这些预算，即食品预算。
 是这样吗，警长先生？</p>

 好吧，当我们提出明年的预算时，所有这些都将很快提出。
 请问今年我们用了什么，资源是怎么分配的？
 因为我知道有时我们使用社区学校，你知道，如果我们在一项预算中有额外的钱来弥补另一项预算的不足，学校委员会是否会投票支持它，或者这只是一个适当的事情？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6347.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 我们在年底这样做。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6359.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 但你知道，我们总是在最后付出。
 一旦一切都协调好，就需要一段时间来协调，因为东西在夏天到达，被征税，被保留到支付电费，类似的事情。

 我不想尝试去参与太多的事情。
 我不想让任何人灰心，但这是你能做的最重要的事情。

 但问题是，你知道，时机。
 我想当我们20号开会的时候它会给你带来一些东西。
 你会更快地看到一些东西。
 也许您不需要小组委员会，因为我们会解释。
 你可以看看它并说：是的，它有效。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6489.904s">[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>: 出色地。
 嗯，我对这个问题的最终想法是，呃，我看到了这个，嗯，
 今年夏天的训练营和项目即将公布。
 我只是想确保一切都通过社区学校和我们新的在线支付系统从 7 月 1 日开始。
 因此，如果所有教练和任何想要使用我们设施的人都知道这一点，那将是一个巨大的帮助。
 因为我一直在网上看到一些东西。
 令人担忧的是，也许社区中的每个人还不知道新流程。
 所以我希望能够传达这一点。
 我知道您很忙，但我想确保我们不会遇到今年早些时候遇到的同样情况。

 我一直喜欢他们。
 我喜欢阅读它们，因为它们比数字更容易阅读。
 我只有一个问题，因为我知道您正在与 Transfinder 合作，我想和您谈谈。
 去年有一个来电者提出了一个悬而未决的问题，他今年再次来电，希望将他们的巴士站从沃德尔和帕克迁走。
 所以我想知道是否有办法与 Transfinder 核实一下，看看是否还有其他可行的路线。
 再往前走一点，还有一个街角，我已经见过这位居民一次了，但是在下一条街的 Park Ave 上，几乎是一个更好的位置，而且仍然会走同样的路线，到 Highland，孩子们不会在 Highland Ave 下车，巴士会右转进入 Park Ave，
 然后右转进入 Waddell 到达下一个拐角，拐角几乎有公共汽车那么大。
 公交车可能会停在那里，然后汽车就无法流通。
 我知道四个角站是理想的选择，但居民告诉我，他看到的是公交车周围的汽车，即使红绿灯还亮着。
 他说这更多的是一个安全问题，因为即使灯开着，汽车也只是，你知道，
 你知道，要避免它，即使它是非法的。
 他们是，你知道，所以，你知道，这只是一个想法。
 你知道我的意思吗？
 如果我们只是将其推到下一条街（实际上大约 50 英尺）。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6673.502s">[Patricia Velie]</a>: 是的，我在 Transfinder 工作期间一直在关注这一站。

 总监先生，请报告公共记录法案的情况。</p>

 上周五，抱歉？
 然后上周五，州长签署了公共记录法案。
 立法机关最近几个月终于起草了该法案。
 我不会详述所有事情。
 这里有很多。
 显然，我们需要更仔细地考虑这个问题，但是这个问题有新的执行程序，并且公共记录法有新的要求，这意味着当人们提出某些要求时我们必须更加关注。
 显然，你知道，这是必要的重新思考电子记录与纸质记录，谁是这些东西的保管人，以及什么构成公共记录与什么构成豁免记录。
 公共记录法有多项豁免规定。
 显然，国务卿最近仍然必须颁布法规。
 当你颁布这些规定时，这将是另一个
 向前迈出一步。
 但这预计将于 2017 年 1 月生效。因此，在接下来的几个月中，我们将密切关注监管要求是什么以及法律要求如何发展。
 但请您仔细阅读、审阅，我们也会关注并及时通知您，以便出现这些问题时我们能够妥善解决。
 我想说你应该记住一件事：你的电子邮件是公共记录。
 您的电子邮件是公共记录，因此如果您在电子邮件中说了一些与您本意无关的内容，则可能会被发现。

 市长女士和委员会成员，
 正如之前报道的那样，凯文·安德鲁斯 (Kevin Andrews) 将离职，出任纳汉特小学 (Nahant Elementary School) 校长。
 因此，6 月 1 日星期三，我会见了布鲁克斯学院的教员以及黛安·考德威尔，然后会见了家长领导团队，听取他们对继任计划的看法。
 两次会议内容丰富，但结论非常相似。
 任命一名内部人员担任该职位几乎是一致的共识。
 人们对连续性有着强烈的渴望。
 并且对现任副局长有着极大的信任。
 校长同意这种支持表达。
 因此，除非学校委员会真的想经历不同的过程，否则我真的不想为任何人上演小马表演。
 我不想吸引人们参与并假装我们正在接受真正的采访，而我确实相信我们正在接受采访。
 在我们开始之前，我们很可能已经有了一个已知的结论。
 当然，我会与工会讨论编辑问题，但显然我想知道这将使布鲁克斯社区在夏天回家之前知道结果，并允许计划继续进行。
 它还将为预算流程提供信息，因为如果我在内部采取行动，这将节省一些相关的成本，我认为这对我们来说是一个明显的优势。
 鉴于今年的预算。
 所以我告诉你。
 我想收到您的一些意见。

 我们关注内部的原因是因为我们想给我们的员工一次机会，但两次，这也是一个明显的预算优势。
 如果我有一个高级教职人员有资格担任副主任，那么以较低的工资取代他们并收回一些预算资金肯定会有所帮助。
 因此，在内部工作有一些优势，但如果这种情况没有发生并且不起作用，我们就会做我们必须做的事情。</p>

 新业务。
 决定，梅德福学校委员会向韦斯·富特老先生的家人表示最深切的哀悼。
 Foote先生多年来担任梅德福公立学校的木匠领班。
 他的妻子康妮是工资办公室的一名职员。
 如果我们都能起立默哀片刻就好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7357.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 韦斯特·富特（West Foote）多年来一直担任公立学校的木匠领班。
 韦斯特是一个非常温柔的灵魂，一个大人物，非常坚强，而且你知道，他是一个非常冷静、令人难以置信的人。
 他的妻子康妮是薪资办公室的关键人物之一，你知道，他们两人之所以见面，是因为他们基本上都是总部的一部分。
 韦斯非常非常熟练。
 你不需要向韦斯解释如何让事情发生。
 你知道如何实现它。
 富特家族多年来在社区中非常活跃。
 他的女儿琳达、儿媳琳达和儿子小韦斯。
 和他们很亲近，人很好，对吧，95岁了。
 95年。
 上帝保佑你。
 他是一位伟大的球员，我仍然可以看到韦斯走在大厅里。
 和厄尼·恶魔一起观看。
 不知道你还记不记得厄尼恶魔。
 厄尼恶魔，他们俩。
 厄尼是人群中的角色，韦斯是最直言不讳的一个。
 这真的很有趣，因为厄尼会说些什么，而韦斯会说，哦，厄尼，别再这样做了。
 但确实是非常好的、非常有能力的人。
 他们可以做很多事情。
 当时我们有几个木匠。
 他们实际上在学校做了一些非常好的事情来维持学校的发展。
 还有韦斯的美好回忆。
 好孩子。</p>
