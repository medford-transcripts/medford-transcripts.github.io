1
00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:04,795
Investments in our school children continue today.

2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:19,469
Augmented security measures in our centers would not be possible without the collaboration with our public safety professionals.

3
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:25,294
Safety is a core component to an individual's comfort in and desire to be in a community.

4
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:31,941
We have invested in state-of-the-art self-contained breathing apparatus for our firefighters and a second set of turnout gear.

5
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:36,903
Thank you, Medford City Council for voting that last night, for supporting this initiative.

6
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:42,906
These are to provide the most current apparatus for firefighters' safety and ultimately for your safety.

7
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:48,548
Nine new firefighters graduated the academy last month and one entered this past Monday.

8
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,891
We are working hard to keep up with retirements by accelerating the civil service process.

9
00:00:55,516 --> 00:01:08,365
Kudos to our Board of Health for receipt of a seven-year, 100,000 per year grant from the Mass Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Abuse to provide opiate abuse prevention services for six cities and towns in our area.

10
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:21,815
We all understand the impact this drug has on our society, and we are making every effort to raise awareness, erase the stigma, and provide assistance for those suffering from addiction, as well as support for their families.

11
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:38,970
We have formed a team approach under Mary Ann O'Connor, who recently came to us in the last several months, for our prevention and outreach.

12
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,312
We have an outreach manager, a recovery coach, we work with Lawrence Murrell Hospital, and the police department.

13
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:52,914
Every life matters, and we thank our police and firefighters for volunteering to administer NACAN in this cause.

14
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:54,054
Thank you.

15
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,522
And while we are not to clear the trust at Citi, be assured that our police department protocols do not allow for profiling.

16
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:12,803
Witnesses and victims are not asked about their immigration status.

17
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:15,064
So be sure and ask your lawyer.

18
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:26,247
If you can ask me what the question posed to me most often,

19
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:31,191
I would have to say, it's when are we getting a new police station?

20
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,692
I hear day in and day out.

21
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:45,658
And today, just this morning, I announced that we will be submitting a loan order to the city council next week on February 14th, requesting funds to commission an architect to begin the plans for a new station.

22
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:49,700
We have turned the city upside down looking for a new location.

23
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,061
We've toured commercial spaces.

24
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,062
We've contacted property owners.

25
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,883
Property owners have contacted us.

26
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:05,481
And in the end, the right location with no land cost and no relocation during construction is the current site of the training facility on Main Street.

27
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:34,807
The current facility will be demolished, and the proposed 35,000 square foot, three-story new construction will house all amenities of the state-of-the-art resilient headquarters, including deserved equal space for our female and male officers, technology upgrades, and most importantly, safe interior space for our office's well-being.

28
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:37,688
Public safety investments continue today.

29
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,884
In conclusion, this city of ours, this great city of ours, continues to move forward on a foundation built on dialogue.

30
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:05,668
A dialogue that echoes in this building, allowing the voices of all residents to be heard with an attitude of inclusion and fairness.

31
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:13,112
A dialogue of renewal, where creative and imaginative ideas are brought forward to better the quality of life in our city.

32
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:22,222
A dialogue that resonates with the message that Medford is on the move, embracing a future of possibilities, embracing a future of hope.

33
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:30,666
On this night, in our beautiful City Hall, and I say that the state of our city is sound, it is stable, and it is sturdy.

34
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:52,099
And as your mayor, I stand as committed as ever to foster this dialogue with you as we continue to cultivate a city on which we can be partners in progress.

35
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,601
God bless Medford, the commonwealth, and the United States of America.

36
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:02,865
Thank you all very much for being here this evening, and good night, and be safe tomorrow with the upcoming blizzard.

37
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,085
Thank you.

38
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:42,658
Please remain standing.

39
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,987
And for the final invocation and benediction, we invite Reverend Wendy.

40
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,014
Wow.

41
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:56,077
Are you inspired?

42
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:14,352
I was thinking, I don't like the sound stable and sturdy, because that sounds so sound, stable and sturdy.

43
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:23,102
And I was thinking that it felt pretty spectacular and scintillating and safe for all and Stephanie.

44
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,882
to do something for me, citizens of Medford.

45
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:43,065
I wonder if, for just a minute, we can have all of our elected and staff, city staff, sit down for a second.

46
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:45,587
Elected and city staff.

47
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:50,289
And everybody else, I'm gonna ask you to help me bless these people.

48
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:57,592
Would you just extend a hand towards the people who are serving you today?

49
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:00,956
for it continues today.

50
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:03,737
And join me in the spirit of blessing.

51
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:27,009
Great, loving, forgiving spirit of the universe, God of all that is, God of this city, God of these people, God of goodness and change and sturdiness and future and yesterday and today, it continues.

52
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:35,597
And so we ask your blessing on these good people who we have elected and we have given the responsibility to serve us.

53
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:48,241
We thank you for their wisdom, for their courage, for the day-to-day doing it all to make us sturdy and stable and sound.

54
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:53,323
Help them to be courageous as we go from this night.

55
00:07:53,682 --> 00:08:07,233
Help them to be that which we need in this city to make us scintillating and exciting and future-oriented at the same time that we are grounded in all that we have been.

56
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:12,777
God, we thank you, and we ask your blessing on all of these people.

57
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:15,960
And now, if you'll all stand back up.

58
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,227
I will bless us all.

59
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:22,908
May God continue today to bless us and keep us.

60
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:30,950
May God continue today to show us the way and to be gracious to us, to shine upon us.

61
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,772
May God continue today to look upon Medford with kindness and grace and love.

62
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,913
And we pray all of this in the name of love.

63
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:43,473
Let the people say amen.

64
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,091
she prayed.

65
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:04,621
Lieutenant Casey, retire the colors.

66
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,178
Prepare to halt.

67
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,600
Order, halt.

68
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:41,022
Halt.

69
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:48,812
Thank you all, and the mayor kindly invites you to gather for some refreshments, some pastries and some coffee out in the rotunda.

70
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,595
The munchkins out there have eaten them all up by now.

71
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:30,733
Good evening.

72
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:34,474
17th regular meeting of the Memphis City Council, May 2nd, 2017.

73
00:25:35,054 --> 00:25:37,775
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

74
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:40,396
Councilor Del Rosso.

75
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:41,116
Present.

76
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:42,417
Councilor Falcone.

77
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:42,857
Present.

78
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:43,897
Councilor Knight.

79
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:44,377
Present.

80
00:25:44,997 --> 00:25:45,858
Councilor Warren Kern.

81
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:46,858
Present.

82
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:47,638
Vice President Marks.

83
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:48,359
Present.

84
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:49,619
Councilor Scott Kelly.

85
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:49,999
Present.

86
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:51,339
President Caviello.

87
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,000
Present.

88
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,220
Please rise and salute the flag.

89
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:55,741
I pledge allegiance

90
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,679
Motion by Councilor Knight to suspend the rule.

91
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:12,439
Seconded by?

92
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,921
By Councilor Falco.

93
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:15,782
Councilor Knight.

94
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,743
Mr. President, I'd like to take a paper from the table.

95
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:19,464
Paper from the table.

96
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:22,166
Communications from the mayor, 17414, please.

97
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:23,247
17414, on the second please.

98
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:45,012
17-414 to the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council.

99
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:53,366
Dear Mr. President, City Council, I respectfully request to recommend that your honorable body approve the following transfer of funds.

100
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:54,846
Amount, 22,400 from account 010-102-5110-1112.

101
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:55,767
Account 010-151-5110.

102
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:30,092
The purpose of this transfer is to appropriate the funds for the assistant city solicitor position as classification was changed from CAF 10, CAF 12 per request of the city council during the fiscal 17 budget deliberations.

103
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:39,416
In addition, solicitor Romley had a request in this budget narrative that the law office assistant position be reclassified from CAF 3,

104
00:27:40,332 --> 00:27:41,193
to see a four.

105
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:42,414
So it's a run lead.

106
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,816
We'll be here to answer any questions that we may have.

107
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:54,503
Councilor DelaRusso of approval on the motion by Councilor of DelaRusso.

108
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,484
Councilor Knight.

109
00:27:56,864 --> 00:27:59,246
Um, Mr. President, this appears to be housekeeping to me.

110
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:04,070
The council had voted to approve a change in the classification of the assistant city solicitor during last year's budget debates.

111
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,032
Um, and this looks like it's housekeeping to make sure that the accounts line up.

112
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:10,159
I'm hoping that the city solicitor will be able to come up here and confirm that.

113
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:12,281
And then I'd be happy to second council Della Russo's motion.

114
00:28:14,404 --> 00:28:15,125
Mr. Solicitor.

115
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,050
I'm sorry.

116
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,811
I was distracted.

117
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:21,492
Mr. President.

118
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:23,834
Oh, I am Mr. Solicitor.

119
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:24,295
I'm fine.

120
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:24,655
Thank you.

121
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:28,680
Um, the question that I would like to have it back, um, would be,

122
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,221
This is just a housekeeping matter.

123
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:35,625
During the budget debates last year, we voted to approve an increase in the salary of the Assistant City Solicitor.

124
00:28:35,645 --> 00:28:38,507
And this is just a- Yes, this is the appropriation which would take care of the increase.

125
00:28:39,027 --> 00:28:39,688
Okay.

126
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:41,229
That's really the long and short of it.

127
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:45,372
It would have been nice if this had been done concurrently with the reclassification, but it wasn't.

128
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:52,417
So, this is necessary in order for us to be able to finish the fiscal year, everything square.

129
00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:58,461
Mr. President, based on that explanation, I would second Councilor De La Russo's motion for approval.

130
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:03,115
Mr. Solicitor, is this not a change of classification?

131
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:04,075
No, it is not.

132
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:14,120
It's to fund the change in classification that was presented by Councilor Lungo Kern back last year at the beginning of the budgetary year, dealing with the Assistant City Solicitor.

133
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,101
And no, it is not a classification change.

134
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:19,462
It's to fund the change that was made.

135
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:20,083
Thank you.

136
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:24,345
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

137
00:29:26,386 --> 00:29:26,966
All those in favor?

138
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:29,208
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

139
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,511
Councilor DelaRosso?

140
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:34,871
Yes.

141
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,071
Councilor Falco?

142
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:36,492
Yes.

143
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:37,412
Councilor Naik?

144
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:37,932
Yes.

145
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:38,973
Councilor Locker?

146
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:39,993
Yes.

147
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:40,734
Vice President Marks?

148
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:41,534
Yes.

149
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:42,675
Councilor Scarpelli?

150
00:29:43,135 --> 00:29:43,375
Yes.

151
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:44,656
President Caviello?

152
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:45,276
Yes.

153
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:48,018
Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

154
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:49,238
Motion passes.

155
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:49,839
Thank you, Mr. Solis.

156
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:51,560
On behalf of the law department, we thank you very much.

157
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,202
While we're on suspension, Mr. President.

158
00:29:55,282 --> 00:29:55,422
Yes.

159
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:55,702
Table 173.1.

160
00:29:56,682 --> 00:29:57,523
While we're on suspension,

161
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:18,019
17351.

162
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:18,019
Dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve the combining of the Water Enterprise Fund and the Sewer Enterprise Fund into one enterprise fund per Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 53, F12.

163
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,843
To that end, I recommend your approval of the following resolution be it resolved that the City of Medford accepts

164
00:30:28,322 --> 00:30:50,696
the provisions of chapter 44 section 53 F one, two of the Massachusetts general laws and combines the water enterprise fund and the sewer enterprise fund into one enterprise fund effective fiscal year 2018 attached is the combined water and sewer enterprise funds memorandum that was provided to the water and sewer commission.

165
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:57,460
How do you like highlighting benefits of consolidating two enterprise funds into one enterprise fund?

166
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:03,589
A letter from the Water and Sewer Commission is provided, which demonstrates their support.

167
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:11,133
Finance Director Alicia Nunley is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter sincerely.

168
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:12,854
Mayor Stephanie Burke.

169
00:31:13,115 --> 00:31:13,535
Mr. President.

170
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:16,777
Councilor DelaRusso.

171
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:24,062
As this paper was tabled some weeks ago, we've had sufficient time to review, inquire, and as a whole,

172
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:29,649
I would like to this week move approval.

173
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:30,369
Thank you.

174
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:32,851
Counselor Knight.

175
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:34,111
Yes, Mr. President.

176
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:44,297
It's my understanding that this matter was brought forward by the administration in an effort to reduce the duplication of efforts and to streamline some of the accounting principles and practices that they have in the office downstairs.

177
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:49,620
We have a finance director here, and maybe she can confirm that and talk a little bit about how this is going to work.

178
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,802
And then I'll be happy to second Counselor DelaRusso's motion, provided that the questions are answered appropriately.

179
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:54,642
Thank you.

180
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:55,723
Name and address of the director, please.

181
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:02,781
Good evening, honorable counselors, Alicia Nunley, finance director for the city of Medford and through the chair to counselor Knight.

182
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:04,402
Uh, yes, this would be streamlining.

183
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:07,143
The whole accounting would be a lot easier.

184
00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:12,826
We would still have two revenue streams to count for the sewer and water, but all expenses would be shared between the two.

185
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:15,827
Thank you, Mr. President.

186
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:20,329
I'm satisfied with the explanation that the, uh, finance director gave a couple of weeks ago.

187
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:26,392
Um, this couple, but the committee of the whole meeting that we had and the reinforcement of such and her statement again this evening would lead me to

188
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:30,273
I believe that this is something that I can support, and I would second Councilor DelaRusso's motion for approval.

189
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:30,573
Thank you.

190
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:35,455
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

191
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:41,477
Name and address of the record, please.

192
00:32:41,637 --> 00:32:45,059
Robert Penza, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party.

193
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:49,940
I can appreciate the fact that you folks want to incorporate the water and sewer account together, and as Ms.

194
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,002
Notley just indicated, you got permission from the Department of Revenue, from my understanding.

195
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:54,642
Is that correct?

196
00:32:55,965 --> 00:33:04,427
But with that being said, the water and sewer rate does have a section in there that talks about any surplus that's in there for a period of time.

197
00:33:05,187 --> 00:33:18,510
And if, in fact, the surplus is not being used for a project that will begin within a 90-day period of time, and they're sitting on approximately $8 million, that those monies should be returned back to the Medford taxpayers.

198
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:25,571
Now, you just had a committee of the whole meeting tonight to talk about a new connectivity charge that is being proposed by the Water and Sewer Department.

199
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:31,297
but there was no discussion as it related to what's gonna happen to the eight and a half million dollars that's out there.

200
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:54,337
And I would like to make a strong suggestion that the council amend your vote or make it a B paper asking either for the city solicitor, I mean for the city engineer and or the water and sewer department to have a plan presented to folks ready to go within 90 days or that those monies are revert back to the Metro taxpayers.

201
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:56,334
I think it's just fear.

202
00:33:56,815 --> 00:34:01,716
We keep talking and we keep hearing over and beyond, over and over, that we have money in this surplus account.

203
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:06,057
And as it was explained to us— Point of information.

204
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:06,617
Counselor Knight.

205
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:20,461
Am I correct that the paper before us is as to whether or not we want to combine the accounts, not whether or not we're really looking at how the accounts are utilized, but whether or not we're really just allowing the finance director to combine the two accounts for accounting purposes and to eliminate duplication of efforts?

206
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:20,762
Yes.

207
00:34:20,782 --> 00:34:21,062
Thank you.

208
00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:22,062
That is the purpose of the paper.

209
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:31,117
And besides having it for accounting purposes, there is a usage factor in there by emerging the two, which also has a surplus of eight and a half or thereabouts millions of dollars.

210
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:40,139
Again, if the city has no intention of using that money for a project ready to go within 90 days, the money, according to the law, needs to be returned back to the taxpayers.

211
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:50,283
So what I respectfully ask any one of my colleagues, or was in a joint motion, that the city sit down immediately to find out if there is going to be a project within 90 days that's going to be operational.

212
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:50,703
Don't forget.

213
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,081
For years, this money's been sitting there.

214
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:57,664
So as a result of that, it's either use it or give it back.

215
00:34:57,984 --> 00:35:05,949
It's unfortunate that you have accumulated that kind of an account with that kind of money, but not any ongoing projects ready to go for that money to be utilized.

216
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:12,333
And I think that just fits into the parameters of the way the law was written.

217
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:15,515
Thank you.

218
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:18,937

00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:22,155
Is that?

334
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:22,215
No.

335
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:27,971
Do they have a special permit?

336
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:29,052
Okay.

337
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:31,734
Is that cited?

338
00:39:32,214 --> 00:39:32,574
It is.

339
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:32,915
Okay.

340
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,997
Okay.

341
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:39,519
So I see that all the departments have signed off on it.

342
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:46,283
Again, I appreciate the clarification on the 3M hour and move for approval.

343
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:51,647
On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli for approval, seconded by

344
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,421
By Councilor Dela Russo.

345
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:56,722
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

346
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:05,347

Yes.

348
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:07,009
Councilor Falco.

349
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:07,409
Yes.

350
00:40:07,729 --> 00:40:08,209
Councilor Knight.

351
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:08,950
Yes.

352
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,291
Councilor Monacan.

353
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:10,751
Yes.

354
00:40:10,771 --> 00:40:11,952
Vice President Marks.

355
00:40:12,372 --> 00:40:12,692
Yes.

356
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:13,993
Councilor Stappelli.

357
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:14,494
Yes.

358
00:40:14,514 --> 00:40:15,634
Vice President Caterpillar.

359
00:40:16,115 --> 00:40:16,395
Yes.

360
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,717
Seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.

361
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:20,798
Congratulations.

362
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:21,218
Thank you.

363
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:21,859
Thank you very much.

364
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:22,299
Thank you.

365
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:23,720
Good luck in your new business.

366
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:39,212
Motion by Councilor Knight, I'm sorry, by Councilor Mox to revert back to regular business.

367
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:53,482
17-407 offered by Vice President Mox, whereas the West Manfred parking lot, which consists of 35 customer parking spots, will be closed for an extended period of time due to the treatment of

368
00:40:54,342 --> 00:41:12,673
underground contaminants be it resolved that the bus stop in front of 440 High Street at Bogginsport Liquors be temporarily located between Brookline Bank and 422 High Street in the interest of adding additional parking for the West Medford businesses.

369
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:14,634
Vice President Marks.

370
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:16,495
Thank you, Mr. President.

371
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:19,757
I had the opportunity last week to attend

372
00:41:20,462 --> 00:41:30,447
uh, a business, uh, neighborhood meeting, uh, regarding the, uh, proposed work that's going to be done at bargain spot Lickers, the West method parking lot.

373
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:48,717
Uh, it has been mentioned before this council on a number of occasions, uh, there has been a contamination found underground and, uh, the city is in the process of removing the contaminants, uh, through a high water, uh, injection, uh, multiple injections,

374
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,334
into the ground over a sustained period of time.

375
00:41:53,215 --> 00:41:58,962
While this takes place, Mr. President, we were told by the city engineer as well as the chief of police.

376
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:15,601
and as well as the consultant that was hired by the city that this parking lot will not be able to have any parking accommodations for a three phased approach.

377
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:19,465
The first phase I believe will last at least

378
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:38,855
I think it was 21 to 30 days that was mentioned of injections, followed by a phase two process, depending on how successful they are with phase one, that could range anywhere from five to 10 days, depending on what's left over, and then an eventual phase three.

379
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:48,583
The reason why I offer this resolution, Mr. President, is the parking lot behind the Bargain Spot Liquors is a place where many

380
00:42:49,464 --> 00:43:08,722
patrons park to frequent the West Meffitt businesses and actually many businesses will also use that as a place where deliveries could be had, a place where people can come and do some temporary parking to run in and

381
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:12,260
do deliveries and other things in the area.

382
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:21,264
And when we remove these 35 spots, it's gonna become increasingly difficult for people to come in and traverse this area.

383
00:43:21,944 --> 00:43:29,567
There is a plan by the police department to relax some of the parking restrictions in the area for a period of time.

384
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:37,350
There's discussion about also using the tip of Playstead Park for some additional parking.

385
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:54,228
And this resolution actually was from business owners that approached me after the meeting asking that if we could temporarily relocate the bus stop in front of Bargain Spot Liquors, they could pick up four spots in the heart of West Medford Square.

386
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:57,190
And we took a walk along the area.

387
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:03,294
We took a walk up to 422 High Street and also in front of Brookline Bank.

388
00:44:03,914 --> 00:44:06,836
And I think we found a perfect location

389
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:15,458
temporary location that's handicap accessible, because that'll be the first thing the MBTA requires of the city if we move the spot.

390
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:23,464
And indeed, we did see accessibility ramps on the corner of Canal and High Street.

391
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:35,134
And I would ask at this time, Mr. President, in the interest of providing more parking at a time that it's needed in West Medford Square, that this council vote tonight

392
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:49,163
to request immediately that the MBTA go out there and move the spot between Brookline Bank and 422 High Street in the interest of adding additional parking spots in West Meffitt Square.

393
00:44:49,683 --> 00:45:01,906
We also have a number of the business owners, Mr. President, that would like to, I think one or two would like to come up and say a few words regarding how important this is to business and the general vicinity.

394
00:45:03,006 --> 00:45:04,347
And at this time, if we can allow

395
00:45:05,885 --> 00:45:07,326
business owners to get up, Mr. President.

396
00:45:07,446 --> 00:45:08,367
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

397
00:45:08,788 --> 00:45:10,089
Would anyone like to speak in this matter?

398
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:14,432
Good evening.

399
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:15,573
Name and address of the record, please.

400
00:45:15,653 --> 00:45:17,715
Jenny Roach, 64 Bower Street, Medford.

401
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:19,657
I own CB Scoops.

402
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:26,282
I've been asking, actually, for this bus stop to be moved quite a bit for quite a few years.

403
00:45:27,503 --> 00:45:29,905
Just the location, the liquor store, there's a bench there.

404
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:31,887
A lot of people tend to hang there.

405
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:34,089
They go get whatever they get, come and sit.

406
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:41,110
I see elderly, I see children, I see all kinds of people just trying to navigate away from that.

407
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,392
It's just a bad location.

408
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:47,315
You shouldn't be able to bring your kids in front of a liquor store to get on a bus.

409
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:49,096
It should be moved permanently.

410
00:45:49,737 --> 00:45:58,164
I agree with definitely temporary, and I appreciate that first step, but I would like you also to consider talking to the MBTA about moving it permanently.

411
00:45:59,645 --> 00:45:59,925
Thank you.

412
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,411
Would anyone else like to speak on this matter?

413
00:46:08,453 --> 00:46:10,175
They're all shy now, the business owners.

414
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:11,616
Councilor Knight.

415
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:13,017
You did such a good job, Councilor.

416
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:13,958
Councilor Knight.

417
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:23,187
Mr. President, I certainly support this paper wholeheartedly, and I also think that in light of the fact that the majority of these business owners in West Medford do purchase

418
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:35,774
business permits, and this is the business permit lot, that there should be a pro-ratio abatement to the business permit holder for the period of time equivalent to the amount of days that the lot is closed.

419
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:51,260
So I'd like to include that as part of the paper, that the Traffic Commission provide a pro-ratio abatement to the cost of a business permit in the equivalent of the number of days that the individuals that are in possession of the business permit

420
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:54,172
are unable to access the lot.

421
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:55,273
Thank you.

422
00:46:55,293 --> 00:46:57,755
Name and address of the wreckage.

423
00:46:57,855 --> 00:46:59,617
Steven Pompeo, 18 Newton Road, Medford.

424
00:47:00,437 --> 00:47:02,299
Thank you to Councilor Marks for bringing this up.

425
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:11,226
This is going to be very helpful during this process where they're taking away the 35 parking spots in the parking lot for that period of 30 days.

426
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:17,091
It'll also give an opportunity to test out that spot temporarily to see if it is potentially

427
00:47:17,842 --> 00:47:25,191
a long-term solution for moving that bus stop, but at least temporarily for the short term, I'd like the council to support that motion.

428
00:47:26,252 --> 00:47:35,403
This is a project I've been involved in since 2009 when it became a problem, and I know a lot of the business owners can't be here tonight because most of them in West Medford are still open and working.

429
00:47:36,003 --> 00:47:56,756
But during the meeting that Councillor Marks spoke about and at other meetings we've had the consensus has generally been that moving that bus stop would Temporarily would be great to providing more spots right in the heart during this process There's been a number of other Suggestions made to do to help with this situation as well one of them

430
00:47:58,615 --> 00:48:12,827
would be to step up the enforcement of High Street during this rather than, there's been some suggestions to, and they're in good faith, to eliminate paid parking during this process.

431
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:23,176
And if that discussion comes up, I'd just like to say that most of the businesses in West Medford would prefer to have the enforcement stepped up during this process because the businesses want to leave High Street itself

432
00:48:23,836 --> 00:48:29,339
for the customers and try to find alternative places for the business owners.

433
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,861
The tip of Placetet Park was one that's going to come up in front of the Park Commission.

434
00:48:35,102 --> 00:48:37,203
And that's a great suggestion on where to put the business owners.

435
00:48:37,563 --> 00:48:44,447
But if it does come up, we'd like to also have support to double the parking enforcement on High Street so that the traffic gets moved.

436
00:48:45,107 --> 00:48:45,387
Thank you.

437
00:48:45,788 --> 00:48:46,108
Thank you.

438
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,390
Name and address of the record.

439
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,722
DJ dabbing go for 70 high street West Medford.

440
00:48:53,762 --> 00:49:19,158
I own dabs lock Thank you for councillor marks for bringing this up and councillor night for your suggestion on that I brought this actually up to Park Medford back in January when we were initially talking about this I stood at this podium and asked why the work couldn't be done at night what they were going to do about parking and I asked when I was giving over my hundred dollars for the parking permit I said is there gonna be any kind of leeway given where they're gonna be shutting our lot down for probably a close to a quarter of the year

441
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:21,548
So we should be getting a quarter of that money back.

442
00:49:22,088 --> 00:49:24,950
I mean, as business owners, you know, we already spend in taxes.

443
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,211
We already spend for utilities.

444
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:34,496
Now we have to spend for an unguaranteed parking spot, which now for upwards of 30 days, we're just going to be at our own mercy to try to hopefully get a spot on the street.

445
00:49:35,796 --> 00:49:38,738
So, and then the other issue is the bus stop being moved.

446
00:49:39,238 --> 00:49:46,783
It's a great thing, but I think it should be permanently over in front of the bank where it's more ADA and compliant accessible by wheelchairs, people on crutches.

447
00:49:47,331 --> 00:49:59,398
where it's not so much in front of the liquor store, because the next project they're going to do after the parking lot is they're going to be putting curb bump outs there to narrow high street to increase pedestrian safety, traffic flow kind of thing.

448
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:14,693
And when talking with the city engineer, I said, if you put the bump out where you're putting it, and the bus now has to go around it to get into the bus stop, now you're gonna have the buses back in, sticking onto High Street, thus causing more traffic jams than there already are on High Street during the rush hours.

449
00:50:15,193 --> 00:50:18,836
So I think a permanent solution is permanently putting the bus down in front of Brookline Bank.

450
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:24,800
They have their own small parking lot behind the bank for their customers, and I think it's a way to go.

451
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:26,267
So thank you.

452
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:26,767
Thank you.

453
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:32,309
I think there is a proposal to maybe take some, uh, use some land down a place to the park, uh, which has been proposed also.

454
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:35,870
Councilor Scarpelli.

455
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,631
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

456
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:44,213
Uh, I think, uh, my colleague, uh, Michael Moxley bringing this forward and I appreciate all the business owners.

457
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:44,713
I think that,

458
00:50:45,185 --> 00:51:01,519
As the chairperson of transportation, I think that I wholeheartedly support the temporary movement, but call for a subcommittee meeting and request the powers to be from the T to make this a full-time change.

459
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:04,401
So I'll be looking for a meeting relatively soon.

460
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:06,803
I think that we still haven't heard anything back about

461
00:51:07,406 --> 00:51:12,047
The resolution we put in about the Main Street and High Street issues again this week.

462
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:17,308
There were work trucks again in front of that location, that T-stop.

463
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:23,510
And again, it left the buses out onto High Street and off the curb.

464
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:28,471
So I know they told us last meeting pretty arrogantly that that doesn't happen.

465
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:29,671
And no one's called them.

466
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,492
But some people are calling me again.

467
00:51:31,852 --> 00:51:35,873
And I think that we need to move quickly.

468
00:51:36,565 --> 00:51:37,286
on these issues.

469
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:48,693
I know we've talked to the director of ADA and I know that we've heard some concerns, but there are other issues on the other side why people aren't speaking up.

470
00:51:48,753 --> 00:51:51,535
So we need to enforce that.

471
00:51:51,675 --> 00:52:03,182
And hopefully the clerk can reach out again to the department of transportation and the T to get a meeting as soon as possible.

472
00:52:03,222 --> 00:52:03,562
Thank you.

473
00:52:03,782 --> 00:52:04,082
Thank you.

474
00:52:04,102 --> 00:52:04,823
Counsel Scott, Billy.

475
00:52:06,182 --> 00:52:06,782
Also Falco.

476
00:52:07,143 --> 00:52:07,843
Thank you, Mr. President.

477
00:52:07,883 --> 00:52:10,204
I just wanted to thank council Marks for bringing this forward.

478
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:11,865
I think it's a good common sense solution.

479
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:16,468
Uh, that, uh, makes sense for the business owners and for the community in general.

480
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:21,431
Um, I would definitely be in favor of moving the bus stop full time, especially the way from the liquor store.

481
00:52:22,092 --> 00:52:23,853
Um, uh, I'm glad you brought that forward.

482
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:26,134
I'm also glad that the business owners came down tonight.

483
00:52:26,174 --> 00:52:27,415
I think it's important to hear from them.

484
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:32,758
Uh, they experienced this every day and, uh, it's good to get their opinions and it's nice that they came down.

485
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:33,919
So thank you for coming down tonight.

486
00:52:34,513 --> 00:52:36,775
But I am in favor of this resolution, so thank you.

487
00:52:37,336 --> 00:52:37,776
Thank you.

488
00:52:38,316 --> 00:52:39,157
Councilwoman Goldkern.

489
00:52:39,297 --> 00:52:40,518
Thank you, President Caviello.

490
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:45,703
Do we know how many parking spaces we'll be able to capture if we move the stop?

491
00:52:46,984 --> 00:52:47,224
Four?

492
00:52:48,906 --> 00:52:54,410
And with regards to Brookline Bank, are they in compliance?

493
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,331
Are they okay with this?

494
00:52:55,471 --> 00:52:55,832
Do we know?

495
00:52:55,852 --> 00:52:56,652
I don't think we've done.

496
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:58,174
I don't think anyone's talked to Brookline Bank yet.

497
00:52:58,274 --> 00:52:59,875
They do have a parking lot on the rail.

498
00:52:59,895 --> 00:53:00,736
They have a parking lot on the rail.

499
00:53:00,756 --> 00:53:01,697
Okay, so they're not losing.

500
00:53:02,457 --> 00:53:03,257
What are they losing?

501
00:53:03,357 --> 00:53:04,437
They're not losing any spots.

502
00:53:04,497 --> 00:53:08,738
If we know it's a city parking, how many spots will we lose?

503
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,059
Probably two, maybe three.

504
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,819
Uh, I know there's a mailbox there that might have to be moved.

505
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:15,900
Okay.

506
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,342
Vice president amongst the benefit is that we're picking up the spots more in the heart of the square where this is a little further out.

507
00:53:24,942 --> 00:53:26,682
So it accommodates more business where it is.

508
00:53:26,742 --> 00:53:28,923
So, uh, that's, that's what we're hoping to do.

509
00:53:28,983 --> 00:53:29,983
And eventually I agree.

510
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:30,263
I think, uh,

511
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,012
as my colleagues agree, we'd like to see it permanent.

512
00:53:33,552 --> 00:53:40,678
And this may be a great way of just getting it in and then saying it's been working, it's successful, and let's stick with it.

513
00:53:40,698 --> 00:53:43,139
Mr. President, I just want to thank the businesses for showing up tonight.

514
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:52,026
You know, it's amazing when you sit down with business owners and people in the community what great suggestions you can get, Mr. President, and move forward with.

515
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,948
And I just want to thank the business owners.

516
00:53:54,028 --> 00:53:54,348
Thank you.

517
00:53:54,909 --> 00:54:00,153
And if I may, through the chair, with regards to everything that's been discussed tonight,

518
00:54:00,952 --> 00:54:03,393
I hear there's a lot of proposals out there.

519
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:10,297
I know this is starting fairly quickly, and there are a lot of concerns from the business owners down in West Medford.

520
00:54:10,737 --> 00:54:21,202
So when will these proposals be more set in stone so that the business owners can comment and maybe make additional suggestions and recommendations to alleviate some concerns?

521
00:54:21,262 --> 00:54:24,644
Because as a business owner, I would not want to be put out like this for 30 days, 40 days.

522
00:54:27,293 --> 00:54:41,882
So just through the chair, if I could recommend that the mayor's office work with the business owners, maybe whether that be another meeting once their proposals are, you know, kind of set in stone so that we can make sure everybody's happy and we can do whatever we can for the business owners.

523
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:50,267
This is just one step in the many that probably need to be done in the next couple months, but whatever we have to do, we want to make sure that the doors stay open and moving.

524
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:51,307
Thank you.

525
00:54:52,168 --> 00:54:52,648
Councilor Knight.

526
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:54,541
Yes, Mr. President.

527
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:57,422
I'm wondering if maybe someone in the business community can answer this question for me.

528
00:54:57,442 --> 00:55:04,064
But we also have a bus stop on the corner of Warren coming, I guess that would be West, into West Medford.

529
00:55:04,565 --> 00:55:07,666
And we have a bus stop at the corner of Placedead Road at Irving Street.

530
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:18,369
Have those also been looked at as potential bus stops to move further away from the square to create some more parking on the opposite side of the street?

531
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,670
The only other, there's a spot on Warren and High.

532
00:55:22,576 --> 00:55:24,479
The bus stop right in front of the spa.

533
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:25,981
That's the only other spot.

534
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:29,245
And then there's a bus stop on the corner of Irving Street in place of the road.

535
00:55:29,265 --> 00:55:31,068
But I think that's got to stay there.

536
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:32,129
There's nowhere else to go over there.

537
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:33,291
And even if they move it.

538
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:34,412
Nowhere to move there.

539
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:38,438
But I think the proposal was to talk to the park commission and

540
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:43,318
take that small section of Placid Park where they... Well, I'm aware what the proposal is.

541
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:45,960
The question is whether or not those locations have been examined.

542
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:55,526
So hopefully that'll be an area... If I can amend the paper to request that those two locations be examined, the corner of High Street and Warren Street and the corner of Placid Road and Irving Street.

543
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:56,787
Thank you.

544
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:03,512
On the motion by Vice President Marx, seconded by Councilor

545
00:56:05,813 --> 00:56:06,433
Scott Pelley.

546
00:56:07,713 --> 00:56:09,974
Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

547
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:13,114
Immediately be sent to the MBTA.

548
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:16,915
Immediately be sent to the MBTA.

549
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:31,878
Councilor Dela Rucho.

550
00:56:32,018 --> 00:56:32,558
Yes.

551
00:56:32,938 --> 00:56:33,618
Councilor Falcone.

552
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:34,118
Yes.

553
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:35,028
Councilor Nye?

554
00:56:35,268 --> 00:56:35,549
Yes.

555
00:56:35,889 --> 00:56:36,649
Councilor McCurry?

556
00:56:36,669 --> 00:56:36,829
Yes.

557
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,531
Vice President Marks?

558
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:39,151
Yes.

559
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:40,332
Councilor Scott Kelly?

560
00:56:40,412 --> 00:56:40,772
Yes.

561
00:56:41,352 --> 00:56:42,133
President Caviello?

562
00:56:42,613 --> 00:56:42,933
Yes.

563
00:56:43,594 --> 00:56:46,055
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

564
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:49,598
Motion passes.

565
00:56:49,618 --> 00:56:52,119
17-408, offered by Vice President Marks.

566
00:56:52,960 --> 00:57:02,566
Be it resolved that Mitchell Avenue be resurfaced in the interest of public safety and that all potholes and road depressions be repaired

567
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:04,842
In the meantime, Vice President Marks.

568
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:06,624
Thank you, Mr. President.

569
00:57:06,664 --> 00:57:16,931
There's portions of Mitchell Ave that you can actually see the dirt pavement, and it's about time the city moves forward on repaving Mitchell Ave.

570
00:57:17,632 --> 00:57:25,137
I also want to bring up on Salem Street, which I've brought up in the past, you can see the old railroad tracks coming through the road.

571
00:57:25,578 --> 00:57:32,563
And on Riverside Ave, the same thing, not too far from the fire station on Riverside Ave, you can see the old railroad tracks

572
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:34,704
appearing through the road, Mr. President.

573
00:57:35,044 --> 00:57:45,787
So I'd ask that Mitchell Ave be resurfaced in the interest of public safety, and that Salem Street and Riverside Ave be looked at for the railroad tracks that need to be covered up.

574
00:57:46,247 --> 00:57:46,607
Thank you.

575
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:48,308
Councilor Nice.

576
00:57:49,068 --> 00:57:50,689
Mr. President, this is a great resolution.

577
00:57:50,729 --> 00:57:54,170
I think Mitchell Ave's been in rough shape since Testis was opened.

578
00:57:54,790 --> 00:58:00,092
It's been long overdue that the street needs to be repaved, piggybacking on some of Councilor Mack's concerns.

579
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:18,353
Between route 16 at Winthrop street and south street, um, due to the detour that's in place with the closure of the credit bridge, we're seeing a increased volume and cars that are being detoured down to, um, the Winthrop street and south street, Winthrop to high and Winthrop to self.

580
00:58:18,893 --> 00:58:23,254
Um, and in front of the baseball park, we're seeing the field fall apart, the street fall apart as well.

581
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:26,374
And we're seeing the exposed red rip rock like we're seeing on Evan street.

582
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:29,635
Um, and we know that that's not something that we can just patch.

583
00:58:30,483 --> 00:58:40,265
I think this is something that may require a little bit of help from our friends at the state delegation in relation to the Craddock Bridge project and the request that we made last week for mitigation, Mr. President.

584
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:58,289
So I'd ask that this matter be put on a B paper and request that we receive some help in repaving and resurfacing the roadway between Route 16 and South Street as a result of the increased traffic volume on the roadway due to the detour that's in place because of the ramp closure.

585
00:58:58,889 --> 00:58:59,149
Thank you.

586
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,045
Councillor Scarpelli.

587
00:59:02,966 --> 00:59:04,386
Thank you, Mr. President.

588
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:09,748
If we could just ask for an update on the Evans and Parris Street.

589
00:59:10,409 --> 00:59:14,430
I think that was been mentioned, just an update on those locations too.

590
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,551
We can update on Evans and Parris Street.

591
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:18,792
Council Member Kern.

592
00:59:20,253 --> 00:59:21,593
Through the chair, thank you.

593
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:26,555
If we could also, while we're at it, I know this is a good time if we're going to talk about streets.

594
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,776
South Street's been brought up.

595
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:30,837
We did, I believe, talk about

596
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:44,986
traffic calming approaches on that, getting a lot of Mack trucks driving down South, especially since they're deterred from driving down Harvard now, and they're banging potholes, shaking homes, keeping people up at night.

597
00:59:45,506 --> 00:59:59,973
I've got multiple complaints on the speed on South Street, so we did discuss this months ago with regards to working to curve the speeding somehow, whether it be the speed monitoring signs, speed bumps, something needs to be done on South Street because

598
01:00:00,781 --> 01:00:04,945
It's really disrupting peace and enjoyment of the residents there.

599
01:00:05,025 --> 01:00:06,867
So if we could add this to the agenda as well.

600
01:00:07,648 --> 01:00:08,969
Thank you, Councillor Locker.

601
01:00:09,049 --> 01:00:21,121
And if I could add something to that paper, if we could ask why the raised crosswalk on Boston Avenue where Tufts was doing construction was taken down by the city of Medford.

602
01:00:22,883 --> 01:00:23,343
Councillor Knight.

603
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:40,404
Yes, Mr. President, I actually had a conversation with Commissioner Kerins before the Committee of the Whole today, and he informed me that Paris Street would be going underneath, I'm sorry, Evans Street, not Paris Street, would have the ground broken in the next two weeks for that project to start up.

604
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:44,327
So I'm looking forward to seeing that happen to answer Councilor Scott Pelley's question.

605
01:00:44,368 --> 01:00:49,452
And also on your question, I spoke with Rocco DiRico from- I spoke with Rocco myself today.

606
01:00:50,201 --> 01:00:54,283
Tufts University relative to the speed bump and that was a temporary speed bump that was put up during the construction.

607
01:00:54,864 --> 01:01:01,067
The construction is nearing an end so they've taken the temporary speed bump down and they're going to move forward with striping and safety markers and so on.

608
01:01:02,288 --> 01:01:06,951
We're always fighting for raised crosswalks and we had one there that they put in for free and we took it away.

609
01:01:10,092 --> 01:01:19,338
On the motion by Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Scott Pelli, Councilor Kerrio-Viello, Councilor Lococoon,

610
01:01:20,393 --> 01:01:21,214
Councilor Naye.

611
01:01:21,254 --> 01:01:21,894
Councilor Haynes.

612
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:32,323
Motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor De La Russo.

613
01:01:32,803 --> 01:01:34,204
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

614
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:39,929
Councilor De La Russo.

615
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:40,670
Yes.

616
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:42,151
Councilor Falco.

617
01:01:42,191 --> 01:01:42,431
Yes.

618
01:01:42,952 --> 01:01:43,472
Councilor Naye.

619
01:01:43,512 --> 01:01:43,832
Yes.

620
01:01:44,273 --> 01:01:45,113
Councilor Curran.

621
01:01:45,274 --> 01:01:45,654
Yes.

622
01:01:45,874 --> 01:01:46,595
Vice President Marks.

623
01:01:47,035 --> 01:01:47,375
Yes.

624
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:48,776
Councilor Scarpelli.

625
01:01:48,816 --> 01:01:48,997
Yes.

626
01:01:50,714 --> 01:01:53,835
Yes, 17 in the affirmative and then in the negative.

627
01:01:53,915 --> 01:01:55,995
Motion passes.

628
01:01:56,015 --> 01:01:59,356
17-417 offered by Vice President Marks.

629
01:02:00,176 --> 01:02:09,899
Be it resolved that the proposed erection of cell phone towers at 63 Tyler Ave and 59 Charnwood Road be discussed.

630
01:02:10,499 --> 01:02:11,459
Vice President Marks.

631
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:13,820
Thank you.

632
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,220
Thank you, Mr. President.

633
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:31,206
I offer this resolution tonight, Mr. President, to hopefully go back and have the city solicitor look into a resolution that was offered by this council and debated back in 2011.

634
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:40,833
And the reason why I offer this resolution is, Mr. President, there's a proposal by a company called In Motion Wireless and Corp.

635
01:02:41,854 --> 01:02:44,216
And they just actually put,

636
01:02:45,521 --> 01:02:48,782
an announcement in the transcript recently.

637
01:02:48,822 --> 01:02:53,043
It appeared in the April 20th edition of the transcript.

638
01:02:53,063 --> 01:03:02,386
There was a legal notice, and the legal notice stated that they were going to erect two 70-foot cell phone towers, proposed.

639
01:03:03,187 --> 01:03:06,488
And when I saw the addresses, I said, you gotta be kidding me.

640
01:03:07,308 --> 01:03:14,330
The first address, Mr. President, was 63 Tyler Ave, which we all know is a residential area that abuts train tracks.

641
01:03:15,032 --> 01:03:22,274
and also 59 Charnwood Road, which is another residential area that abuts train tracks, Mr. President.

642
01:03:23,054 --> 01:03:36,358
Both towers would be located in smack dab in neighborhoods and, in my opinion, would create a major visual impact in the area.

643
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:44,044
Um, currently in, uh, there was no city ordinance that governs the placement of cell phone towers.

644
01:03:44,624 --> 01:03:49,146
The current ordinance only regulates TV and radio antennas.

645
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:51,667
And it was back in 2008, believe it or not.

646
01:03:53,753 --> 01:04:03,582
I offered a resolution, paper 08-510, that would put into our city ordinance cell phone towers.

647
01:04:04,502 --> 01:04:10,407
And what it would do is it would prohibit cell phone towers in residential areas.

648
01:04:11,308 --> 01:04:17,873
And I'll talk about that a little bit later on, but that paper went through a lot of debate back and forth.

649
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,955
National Grid spoke on the paper.

650
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:34,464
The paper was sent to the office of community development, which all, um, um, ordinances need to be sent to dealing with, uh, zoning and, um, the paper trail kind of dies off after that.

651
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:47,670
But, um, the reason why I offer this tonight, Mr. President is as I stated, um, there is no, uh, ordinance right now that, um, that prohibits towers in residential areas.

652
01:04:48,507 --> 01:04:56,609
And there was a resolution to amend ordinances only allowing cell towers in industrial and commercial zones and also by special permit.

653
01:04:57,389 --> 01:04:59,170
Uh, the matter was tabled by the council.

654
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:14,173
Uh, when a representative from national grid raised an issue that was, um, at least two, um, state statutes allow wireless communication companies to attach antennas and amplifiers on utility poles.

655
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:20,423
And at the time we were prohibiting, um, any, uh, cell towers, uh, within neighborhoods.

656
01:05:20,943 --> 01:05:31,166
And they said that, uh, was in direct, um, conflict with state statute, which allows these utility companies to put them on top of telephone poles.

657
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:36,408
Needless to say, this is not the request that was put in the transcript recently.

658
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:40,690
Um, I'm asking tonight, Mr. President, that, um,

659
01:05:42,695 --> 01:06:11,210
This paper be looked at by the city solicitor, uh, Mark Rumley and the building commissioner and provide, uh, the input that the community development board already gave us and the input language that national grid gave us, uh, which came out with, I believe was a great city ordinance back in 2011, uh, that would address, uh, the issue of erecting telephone, um, cell phone towers in residential neighborhoods.

660
01:06:12,213 --> 01:06:24,098
And so that's my first motion that the city solicitor and the building commissioner look into the 2011 city ordinance draft that was proposed.

661
01:06:24,638 --> 01:06:40,065
And also, Mr. President, the legal notice that was posted deals strictly with locating a cell tower near an historical preservation, national historic preservation.

662
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:57,831
And it's the acts of 1966 and the 2005 nationwide programmatic agreement, uh, that allows for public comment when you're putting a cell phone tower within a half mile of a historic, uh, preservation.

663
01:06:58,672 --> 01:07:02,654
Um, and they're looking for input right now.

664
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:08,718
And I would ask the city solicitor, uh, what legal, um,

665
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:27,610
Maneuvers can be done to, first of all, look at the Royal House, which is probably within, I'd say, a half a mile or very close to Charnwood Road, to see if there's anything we can do on possibly putting a halt to this.

666
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:32,173
And secondly, Mr. President, it's vital now that we act.

667
01:07:34,794 --> 01:07:39,597
I had some people come to me and say, well, there's a lot of areas in the city where

668
01:07:40,178 --> 01:07:44,541
uh, they're considered dead zones and you can't get a cell phone connections and so forth.

669
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,083
Um, that may not even be the case.

670
01:07:47,143 --> 01:07:49,284
These may not even be phone cell towers.

671
01:07:49,704 --> 01:07:53,427
They may be cell towers for use of, uh, the railways.

672
01:07:54,287 --> 01:08:08,457
And, um, I don't have that information, but I know that a city solicitor Romley did reach out to the attorneys that were on the notice I received, uh, just tonight.

673
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:16,554
uh, from the federal communication commission, Washington DC, it's called information notice of section one Oh six filings.

674
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:24,578
They list both addresses and who the petitioner is, is for both in the consultant.

675
01:08:25,358 --> 01:08:28,220
Uh, and I think, uh, solicitor Romley reached out.

676
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:35,143
I'm not sure if he got a response, but I would ask at this time, if the city solicitor can get up, Mr. President, he was involved in 2011,

677
01:08:37,232 --> 01:08:39,874
uh, crafting the language and working on this with the council.

678
01:08:40,595 --> 01:08:41,996
And, uh, I'd like to hear from him.

679
01:08:42,276 --> 01:08:42,596
Thank you.

680
01:08:42,616 --> 01:08:43,857
Name and address of the record, please.

681
01:08:44,057 --> 01:08:44,257
Yes.

682
01:08:44,297 --> 01:08:45,158
Thank you, Mr. President.

683
01:08:45,178 --> 01:08:46,399
My name is Mark Rumbley.

684
01:08:46,779 --> 01:08:50,382
I'm the city solicitor and I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

685
01:08:51,363 --> 01:08:54,905
Um, there's a lot of different things going on with this particular issue.

686
01:08:55,386 --> 01:09:05,193
So if we start and put to the side just for a second, although I appreciate it, the ordinance that was proposed a few years back that really should be revived because procedurally

687
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:27,012
it did reach some type of a death procedurally years ago for different reasons, none of which really are easy to ascertain, but nonetheless it should be revived and it should be revived because it was a good idea that it's a good idea now, even if these notices didn't come forward right now, dealing with, uh, uh, Charnwood and Tyler.

688
01:09:27,572 --> 01:09:27,712
Now,

689
01:09:28,553 --> 01:09:32,816
to go according to what I've come across in the last few days.

690
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:39,239
I received from the city clerk two very vanilla notices under 106.

691
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,941
And I really didn't know what they were.

692
01:09:41,981 --> 01:09:49,025
And it did say Tyler and it did say something about cell phone towers and that sort of thing.

693
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:51,987
After I received it and almost concurrently with

694
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,064
Councilor Mox called me and said, do you know anything about it?

695
01:09:55,084 --> 01:09:58,785
And honestly, I didn't know anything more than those two simple notices.

696
01:09:59,465 --> 01:10:03,126
So, I called the consultant who are in Wisconsin this morning.

697
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:04,627
They called me back this afternoon.

698
01:10:05,487 --> 01:10:18,491
And this notification under chapter, under 106, which is a federal regulation, begins a comment period during which time a municipality, in this case, could comment on this particular proposal.

699
01:10:19,071 --> 01:10:21,452
And it is, as Councilor Mox had stated,

700
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,628
to put up these two towers at this particular address.

701
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:35,095
Now, the consultants were hired, of course, and they were hired by the entity that's serving the MTA, MBTA, excuse me, for these two towers.

702
01:10:35,176 --> 01:10:40,519
Because ostensibly, the use of the towers would be to serve the ridership on the trains.

703
01:10:40,539 --> 01:10:45,403
It may not simply be a cell tower like servicing our cell phones.

704
01:10:45,463 --> 01:10:49,546
It could be to provide Wi-Fi services to the people on the train.

705
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,522
And it is for the MBTA that this was planned.

706
01:10:55,542 --> 01:11:01,146
So the person on the other end was very informative, a very professional gentleman named Andrew Rice.

707
01:11:01,946 --> 01:11:05,128
And I said, is this going to service the MBTA only?

708
01:11:05,188 --> 01:11:06,309
Because I wanted to know that.

709
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,410
And he said, well, yes, of course.

710
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:11,932
Well, of course, over the years, we all learned a little bit about cell towers.

711
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:23,771
And a cell tower is not necessarily just for the one use, which is on that tower, because there's a whole industry, a billion dollar industry in cell towers, where the spots on that tower are sold.

712
01:11:24,412 --> 01:11:33,759
So I asked Mr. Rice today, is it the intention of the MBTA to sell any other spaces on this tower, on these towers, if they build them for commercial use?

713
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:41,746
And the reason that I asked that is, Mr. Rice indicated, well, for many purposes, although he didn't enumerate the purposes,

714
01:11:42,136 --> 01:11:47,978
For many purposes, the MBTA is exempt from local rule, and there's something to say about that.

715
01:11:48,139 --> 01:11:50,700
There is some validity to that, depending upon the use.

716
01:11:51,480 --> 01:12:06,466
But I said, if you're going to sell or you're going to rent out any of the spots on that tower, then you're not just simply using it for MBTA uses, you're using it for commercial uses, for a for-profit use, and that brings things out of many areas of exemption.

717
01:12:06,946 --> 01:12:10,048
Now, of course, that's the first time we talked about it, so there's a little bit of,

718
01:12:11,546 --> 01:12:13,628
I would say silence for a few seconds after that.

719
01:12:13,648 --> 01:12:14,588
I was just lifted at that.

720
01:12:15,269 --> 01:12:24,476
So, the second thing is, when this notice went in the transcript, that began what under 106 is a 30-day comment period.

721
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:30,560
A 30-day comment period for everyone to send in their sentiments, concerns, and questions.

722
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:41,368
Now, I believe that the direct communication to the city was sent to the city clerk, the historic commission, I believe, and also it said generically the city of Medford.

723
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:49,344
Well, we can all say it was sent to the city of Medford, but you need to have a little bit of meat on the bones when you use that particular term.

724
01:12:49,745 --> 01:12:56,909
So to make sure the city of Medford received it, I asked Mr. Rice to send me the full packet this afternoon, which he did by email.

725
01:12:57,269 --> 01:13:02,692
And I flipped it out to nine or 10 department heads and I shared it with the council.

726
01:13:03,173 --> 01:13:04,693
But I think you might've had it anyway.

727
01:13:04,733 --> 01:13:06,875
I didn't know, but I wanted to make sure that you had it.

728
01:13:07,575 --> 01:13:08,816
So where does that leave us?

729
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:17,322
That leaves us, one, with an ordinance that probably needs a little bit of shaping and a little bit of polish for present day, which is a good idea anyway.

730
01:13:17,582 --> 01:13:18,282
Should look at that.

731
01:13:18,883 --> 01:13:34,833
And two, it puts us smack dab in the middle of a comment period where the city, its departments, its executive branch, and all other entities that have been notified should give their concern into the FCC under this notice.

732
01:13:35,915 --> 01:13:51,747
Third, it puts us in the position of examining what the exact use would be by the MBTA and whether or not, if they do have any exemptions, whether or not those exemptions are waived or in any other way altered because of any intended commercial use of the cell tower.

733
01:13:52,768 --> 01:14:04,076
Finally, if the ordinance which was not passed a few years back is enacted in some way, shape, or form right now, then the question could be, and there is no definitive answer to this, what effect

734
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:08,211
a newly passed ordinance would be on this particular project.

735
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:23,736
Because the effective date or the notice date for the world, for the general public, so to speak, and you should always keep this in mind with a zoning enactment, is the date of publication before the planning board.

736
01:14:24,456 --> 01:14:32,038
For example, about 20 years ago or 25 years ago, there was a moratorium put in place for certain uses in the city of Medford.

737
01:14:32,402 --> 01:14:35,664
that became effective when it was advertised before the planning board.

738
01:14:36,204 --> 01:14:52,335
So if this ordinance went forth and was advertised before the planning board, that may well have some effect on this particular project, but that also would beg some other questions, like what exactly will the MBTA be using this tower for outside of serving its ridership?

739
01:14:53,195 --> 01:15:00,320
I know that sounds like a lot, but everything has to be broken down to its simplest elements, and we have to begin at the beginning.

740
01:15:00,808 --> 01:15:14,236
So the first domino to fall, and there are two concurrently, would be for the council to revive a look at that older ordinance that was proposed because procedurally it's not alive.

741
01:15:14,856 --> 01:15:26,663
And secondly, for all of the entities in the city of Medford, the various departments, et cetera, to craft carefully their concerns and to submit them under this notice period.

742
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:30,625
And the very last thing I'd say before I yield to my good friend,

743
01:15:31,267 --> 01:15:51,541
is that the purpose of this notice period is under the NEPA to make certain determinations as to historical uses in the area, which is why the Royal House is a pertinent, in its distance away from this particular proposed cell tower, is pertinent.

744
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,684
And that comes up under the National Environmental Policy Act.

745
01:15:56,564 --> 01:15:59,306
So there are the various elements of this matter.

746
01:15:59,839 --> 01:16:02,280
and the various nuances that were presented with.

747
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:07,623
Thank you.

748
01:16:07,643 --> 01:16:08,624
Name and address of the record, please.

749
01:16:09,204 --> 01:16:09,905
Tom Lincoln.

750
01:16:09,925 --> 01:16:14,027
I'm an executive director of the Royal House and Slave Quarters at 15 George Street.

751
01:16:14,067 --> 01:16:17,689
I live at 27 Gleason Street in Medford.

752
01:16:18,309 --> 01:16:24,813
I'd like to thank Councillor Marks and also the city solicitor and Ken Kraus, who actually brought this in front of

753
01:16:25,644 --> 01:16:26,886
some of us in the community.

754
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:31,812
The Royal House and Slave Quarters, as we can best figure it, is about 2,000 feet away.

755
01:16:32,753 --> 01:16:42,705
One thing that I think needs clarification, as I understand it, is that these are legal addresses, but the cell phone towers are actually proposed on the railroad right away.

756
01:16:42,725 --> 01:16:45,008
I think you probably have to give the closest

757
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:46,968
street address to there.

758
01:16:47,668 --> 01:16:57,893
But that said, the Royal House and Slave Quarters is a National Historic Landmark, which is the highest category of historic sites right here in Medford.

759
01:16:58,153 --> 01:17:00,515
We certainly preceded these cell phones by about 287 years.

760
01:17:04,461 --> 01:17:12,244
And we're concerned, as I've talked to some of my colleagues and people on the board at the Royal House and Slave Quarters, about the visual impact.

761
01:17:13,024 --> 01:17:21,947
74 feet, I'm not an expert on visual impacts, but 74 feet is 65, 75, 74 feet, whatever it is, is pretty high.

762
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:24,608
I think it's higher than any building in the neighborhood.

763
01:17:24,648 --> 01:17:31,110
It's certainly higher than our, than the 1737 house that we have, as well as the Slave Quarters.

764
01:17:33,133 --> 01:17:40,095
It's also not clear, and I think it will be good to know, exactly what the consequences are of commenting.

765
01:17:40,195 --> 01:17:51,039
If it's just a comment period just to gather information, and if you don't have any statutory rights, et cetera, I'm not sure how much good that would do.

766
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:56,281
So we're certainly, at the Royal House of Slave Quarters, are concerned about this.

767
01:17:56,601 --> 01:18:02,223
We're certainly going to comment, along with the city departments,

768
01:18:03,032 --> 01:18:14,480
One thing, if you haven't been on a tour at the Royal House Slave Quarters recently, one thing we try to convey with our one acre left of 500 historic acres is the extent of the property.

769
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:20,525
And so we do talk about the surrounding landscape and people certainly get a view of the neighborhood.

770
01:18:20,685 --> 01:18:31,913
And I'm trying to imagine what it might look like with the cell phone tower sticking up above every other house off of George Street and back in that adjacent neighborhood.

771
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:49,444
The second place, which I wear several hats here, but the second place which may be affected, though I think visually may be not affected, is the Brooks Estate, which I believe is about a half a mile from the Tyler Avenue location.

772
01:18:49,464 --> 01:18:51,265
63, is it 63 Tyler?

773
01:18:52,925 --> 01:18:59,467
Is very close to Grove Street, up on the north end of Tyler there.

774
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:10,533
The last point I would make, and I think this is certainly in the back of people's minds, if there are two towers being proposed today, what's in the future here?

775
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:27,427
There are clearly some interesting and perhaps difficult jurisdictional issues in terms of the MBTA, et cetera, but the demand for bandwidth, as I understand it, the demand for services is certainly not going down.

776
01:19:30,897 --> 01:19:33,719
Going back to the cell phone side, there are certainly dead spots.

777
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:39,424
In fact, the royal house, if you're inside the royal house, it's very hard to get cell phone service for some reason.

778
01:19:40,925 --> 01:19:46,469
And I think that precedent is a thing to worry about here in terms of.

779
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:52,454
And these are really, any way you look at it, these are really tall structures.

780
01:19:54,236 --> 01:19:56,378
In the past, in fact, this has happened in West Bedford,

781
01:19:57,611 --> 01:20:00,752
cell phone transmitters, or whatever they are, or amplifiers, I guess.

782
01:20:01,573 --> 01:20:04,014
Cell phone service have been placed atop buildings.

783
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:05,134
They've been disguised.

784
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,256
There's no disguising these towers.

785
01:20:08,656 --> 01:20:12,757
So we look forward to learning more about this.

786
01:20:12,957 --> 01:20:19,480
And we look forward both to an effective ordinance and to a resolution of some of these issues.

787
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:19,900
Thank you.

788
01:20:23,802 --> 01:20:24,162
Thank you.

789
01:20:25,303 --> 01:20:26,103
Name and address of the record.

790
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:30,843
Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue in West Medford.

791
01:20:30,863 --> 01:20:33,565
I, like Mr. Lincoln, I wear several hats here.

792
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:35,666
I'm on the Medford Historic Commission.

793
01:20:36,507 --> 01:20:51,518
I'm a director of the Brooks City Land Trust, and I've also served as the former chair of the Green Line Extension Design Working Group, which is currently dormant, but this is affected by the Green Line because of the property on Charnwood, which is directly abuts the

794
01:20:52,605 --> 01:20:54,606
future Green Line extension to Tufts.

795
01:20:55,466 --> 01:20:56,767
I want to echo what was said before.

796
01:20:56,827 --> 01:21:02,149
I think there's a, these are insanely large, very disruptive visually.

797
01:21:02,729 --> 01:21:05,931
They lower property values, frankly, for anyone within sight of them.

798
01:21:06,131 --> 01:21:10,353
Certainly the backyards of the people along Charnwood are not going to be enhanced by them.

799
01:21:11,773 --> 01:21:18,876
On the Memphis Historic Commission, we have reviewed at least a half a dozen soap tower proposals in the last few years.

800
01:21:19,737 --> 01:21:20,337
They've all been

801
01:21:21,587 --> 01:21:22,207
penthouses.

802
01:21:22,308 --> 01:21:26,410
They've all been on the sides of buildings, buried amongst mechanical equipment.

803
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:32,453
They've never been freestanding because it's insane to even propose that in a dense city like the city of Medford.

804
01:21:32,473 --> 01:21:33,293
It's too disruptive.

805
01:21:33,914 --> 01:21:45,840
We've approved them because, well, we didn't actually approve them, but we commented on them, and we sometimes were able to guide them on things like paint colors or maybe shifting their location to be less visually intrusive, but we

806
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:49,834
They've always been rather intelligently proposed, and these are not.

807
01:21:50,234 --> 01:21:56,817
These are obviously in smack dab in the navel of the West Medford and the Hillside neighborhoods, and they're going to cause immeasurable damage.

808
01:21:57,598 --> 01:22:04,541
So there are plenty of buildings that are about 70 feet tall, all along the railway, not far from these locations.

809
01:22:05,182 --> 01:22:09,364
We just need to push them a little bit to come up with a better design rather than the plain, simple drop.

810
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:13,626
It's 75 feet to the top of equipment is what the drawings say that we all received today.

811
01:22:15,705 --> 01:22:17,787
Basically go back to the drawing board and try again.

812
01:22:17,867 --> 01:22:18,928
Try a better way to do it.

813
01:22:19,509 --> 01:22:21,251
Think of the Cummings building on Boston Ave.

814
01:22:21,271 --> 01:22:22,092
The U-Haul building.

815
01:22:22,492 --> 01:22:26,056
Think of several buildings along Tufts not too far from Charnwood.

816
01:22:26,696 --> 01:22:31,301
Those are perfectly logical places we could put these towers and nobody would ever see them.

817
01:22:31,882 --> 01:22:37,628
We just need to work better and start a dialogue but tell them this is simply unacceptable.

818
01:22:38,205 --> 01:22:42,428
I mean, the Grove Street slave wall is probably within 700 feet of the one in Playstead.

819
01:22:43,028 --> 01:22:45,509
This will be looming over the ball fields on Playstead.

820
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:50,513
I believe the royal house is within, I know the Brooks Estate, at least a portion with the ponds is within that half mile.

821
01:22:50,533 --> 01:23:01,239
So there's clearly some historic resources that the documents say there's no negative effect on in the 33-page document you all received today, which is simply not true.

822
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:03,000
So we just need to basically pause

823
01:23:04,851 --> 01:23:05,972
and come up with a better solution.

824
01:23:06,012 --> 01:23:07,552
I'm convinced there is a good one here.

825
01:23:07,632 --> 01:23:09,373
We don't need to reinvent the wheel.

826
01:23:09,873 --> 01:23:11,614
They should not be putting these in residential neighborhoods.

827
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:13,015
We do need to revise our zoning.

828
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:14,596
I completely agree with the council on that.

829
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:18,998
And I look forward to helping that make, make that occur in the very near future.

830
01:23:19,158 --> 01:23:19,478
Thank you.

831
01:23:19,918 --> 01:23:22,880
Thank you, Mr. Councilor Scott Pelley.

832
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:25,381
Thank you, Mr. President.

833
01:23:25,941 --> 01:23:33,805
I know that back in the day when this resolution that council marks talking about was directly involved in the field of dreams committee and

834
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:42,430
One of the biggest issues we had was that cell phone tower and the operation being built behind the high school.

835
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:52,312
And one of the biggest benefits for that American cell phone tower company at the time was how quickly and how much money they would make off of selling parts of that tower.

836
01:23:52,332 --> 01:24:00,494
What would be interesting to me is to see where else on the line that the T would be looking to put other towers.

837
01:24:00,794 --> 01:24:02,414
Because if you can, I think that

838
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:03,992
would be a direct correlation.

839
01:24:04,032 --> 01:24:19,035
If you see it just, you know, not just Medford, but you see it down the line, I think it might help us in really understanding that they're using, I mean, let's all, you know, state the facts, the T's in huge financial difficulties.

840
01:24:19,515 --> 01:24:28,217
So I'd like to see that maybe if there's a way to ask them in our conversations, are we just looking in Medford or are they looking all the way down the line?

841
01:24:28,237 --> 01:24:30,517
Because if I think they, if they are doing that,

842
01:24:31,501 --> 01:24:42,688
I think this would be just a clear punch in the face that shows that they're using this for a revenue stream rather than what might be just discussed.

843
01:24:42,728 --> 01:24:49,292
So that'd be interesting to see if we can reach out and ask that question.

844
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:52,535
If it's just Medford, are they putting those towers elsewhere?

845
01:24:52,995 --> 01:24:55,857
It would be an interesting information.

846
01:24:55,877 --> 01:24:56,357
So thank you.

847
01:24:56,537 --> 01:24:58,238
Thank you, Councilor Scott.

848
01:24:58,338 --> 01:24:58,999
Vice President Max.

849
01:24:59,559 --> 01:25:00,480
Thank you, Mr. President.

850
01:25:01,755 --> 01:25:11,341
Just if I could, in addition to what was mentioned about the legal notice, uh, regarding, uh, the public input, uh, on a national registered or historic places.

851
01:25:12,001 --> 01:25:26,730
Um, I did speak to Paul Moki, the building commissioner, and he stated that the only requirement that he is aware of as building commissioner, if someone wants to erect a cell phone tower, it's a building permit and an electrical permit.

852
01:25:27,391 --> 01:25:29,212
There's no others, no special permit.

853
01:25:29,943 --> 01:25:32,424
There's no other hoops that you have to jump through.

854
01:25:33,204 --> 01:25:40,466
And there may be a question regarding zoning setbacks, and that's something that's being looked at currently right now.

855
01:25:40,866 --> 01:25:57,530
So at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that the original paper, 11-477, be sent to Solicitor Rumley, and that is the paper that includes

856
01:25:58,134 --> 01:26:11,243
The recommendations from the community development board, which recommended that wireless towers only be constructed in the two most industrial zoning districts in the city.

857
01:26:11,923 --> 01:26:19,048
And that also the board recommended the city council be the granting authority for special permits for towers in those zones.

858
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,470
So those were the two recommendations that came out.

859
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:26,473
National grid also to be in compliance with the two state statutes.

860
01:26:26,997 --> 01:26:33,518
a recommended language that would still allow them to put cell towers on their telephone poles.

861
01:26:33,578 --> 01:26:38,559
And I won't speak for the city solicitor, but I think that's something that we're obligated to do.

862
01:26:38,959 --> 01:26:41,639
We want to adhere to whatever state statute is.

863
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:49,141
And this paper, Mr. President, I believe addresses all those concerns and it's a combination of all that input.

864
01:26:49,641 --> 01:26:54,662
I would also ask that my paper be referred to the committee of the whole.

865
01:26:55,342 --> 01:26:55,842
So paper 17 dash

866
01:26:57,575 --> 01:26:59,697
417 be referred to the Committee of the Whole.

867
01:27:00,197 --> 01:27:26,358
Once we get a response back from the city solicitor on paper 11-477 on the language, we can meet in the Committee of the Whole and hopefully we can push this ordinance through after three readings, Mr. President, and give the neighborhood the safeguards and the peace of mind that they deserve that these towers won't be popping up, Mr. President, in places that they're not welcomed.

868
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:27,554
Thank you Mr. Vice Presidents.

869
01:27:28,254 --> 01:27:28,994
Counselor Knight.

870
01:27:29,515 --> 01:27:35,576
Mr. President, I feel as though the course of action that Councilor Marks just laid out makes perfect sense and I would second the motion.

871
01:27:35,796 --> 01:27:36,296
Move approval.

872
01:27:37,636 --> 01:27:40,677
On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

873
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:42,977
All those in favor?

874
01:27:43,418 --> 01:27:43,538
Aye.

875
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:46,138
Motion passes.

876
01:27:47,838 --> 01:27:51,859
We will do our best to get a Council of the Whole within the next two weeks.

877
01:27:52,019 --> 01:27:54,820
Seeing that our Council of the Whole is a little on the full side right now and

878
01:27:55,263 --> 01:27:56,924
Hopefully we can get it in before budget season.

879
01:27:59,084 --> 01:28:01,946
Yes, I'm sure the city solicitor will work diligently on it.

880
01:28:01,966 --> 01:28:02,786
Am I correct?

881
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:06,047
Thank you.

882
01:28:06,067 --> 01:28:08,988
17-409 offered by Councilor Falco.

883
01:28:10,009 --> 01:28:23,774
Whereas the Memphis City Council will soon be reviewing the proposed city budget, be it resolved that the city administration send summarized CCLIX fixed data to the Memphis City Council

884
01:28:24,505 --> 01:28:27,826
to help aid budget decision making.

885
01:28:29,426 --> 01:28:30,626
Councilor Falco.

886
01:28:31,366 --> 01:28:32,466
Thank you, Mr. President.

887
01:28:32,706 --> 01:28:39,027
As we all know, budget season is upon us and we will be meeting hopefully sooner than later with regard to the city budget.

888
01:28:39,668 --> 01:28:49,369
But I know during the budget deliberations, there's always plenty of questions as to what the different departments do and whatnot and what's being accomplished.

889
01:28:49,809 --> 01:28:53,750
So I just wanted to be proactive here and see if we could get a report.

890
01:28:54,507 --> 01:28:58,888
see click fix report with regard to the items that are being reported.

891
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:10,792
Um, you know, so I guess the issues that are being reported, the data being reported, uh, the department that the issue is being assigned to in the duration that it's taking for these issues to get fixed.

892
01:29:11,392 --> 01:29:19,834
Um, I think it would be good to actually had that information when we go into a budget deliberations, um, you know, data driven decision making, I don't think it's a bad thing.

893
01:29:19,874 --> 01:29:21,655
I think it's good to actually had that information.

894
01:29:22,197 --> 01:29:36,587
when we're negotiating the budget, I think it would benefit all of us to get a true picture as to, you know, what different departments are doing on a daily basis and to see what, you know, different problems are occurring throughout the city and, you know, how long it's taking to get these fixed.

895
01:29:37,328 --> 01:29:41,491
So I would ask for some support and move approval.

896
01:29:42,131 --> 01:29:42,391
Thank you.

897
01:29:43,292 --> 01:29:43,492
Second.

898
01:29:44,033 --> 01:29:44,513
Councillor Knight.

899
01:29:45,503 --> 01:29:58,792
Mr. President, this is a great resolution, and I don't think anybody behind this rail is going to vote against it, especially based on the fact that when C-Click Fix was rolled out, we've asked for quarterly reports, and those quarterly reports were not forthcoming.

900
01:29:59,632 --> 01:30:01,894
I thank Councilor Falco for putting this resolution on.

901
01:30:01,994 --> 01:30:08,858
I also thank him for his foresight in starting to think about the budget at this early time, not really early, but earlier than usual.

902
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:14,602
So I certainly wholeheartedly support this request, Mr. President, and I would like to add a B paper.

903
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:29,136
uh, requesting that the council reiterate its request to receive quarterly reports from see click fix on the motion by counselor Falco seconded by counselor Della Russo as amended by counselor night.

904
01:30:30,297 --> 01:30:31,077
All those in favor.

905
01:30:32,578 --> 01:30:39,503
Motion passes 17 four one zero offered by counselor Scott Pelley.

906
01:30:40,404 --> 01:30:44,087
Be it resolved that the city council discuss signage

907
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:46,839
located on public lands.

908
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,740
Counselor Scarpelli.

909
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,460
Thank you, Mr. President.

910
01:30:52,381 --> 01:31:14,586
This is multifaceted, but I think that a few of the concerns that I'd like to address that we like answered from the Department of Public Works is looking at our ordinances and what we're asking our constituents to follow at our local ball fields and looking at the signs that are there now and making sure they're

911
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:22,595
They're updated and the graffiti is removed from some of them or replaced if we can.

912
01:31:23,155 --> 01:31:33,743
And second that we look at, I've had a few phone calls that the private entities are using public land to advertise.

913
01:31:35,043 --> 01:31:43,189
One constituent called and mentioned that there was a painting company that was putting their signage in front of their

914
01:31:43,734 --> 01:31:45,034
public land in front of their home.

915
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:48,636
And they thought the question was, is the city approving that?

916
01:31:48,676 --> 01:31:49,976
Is that something that I have to keep there?

917
01:31:50,476 --> 01:31:56,558
So, um, I'd like to get, uh, you know, what, if we can look into what department can answer that for us.

918
01:31:57,078 --> 01:32:01,560
And if there is no such, I think we can go to the code enforcement officer.

919
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:10,723
We can look at the code enforcement officer and ask that, that they then remove all the signs located on islands and in front of homes that have

920
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:20,076
patches of grass that they're just putting down these lawn signs of private entities for advertising.

921
01:32:20,136 --> 01:32:26,460
So if, other than the Scott Pelley for council, I think that we should definitely look into that.

922
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:27,360
Thank you.

923
01:32:28,281 --> 01:32:38,486
If I could amend that, that the the building department also look at all the A-frames that are littering our sidewalks, which aren't supposed to be there either.

924
01:32:39,347 --> 01:32:39,587
Thank you.

925
01:32:41,467 --> 01:32:45,649
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

926
01:32:45,709 --> 01:32:46,330
All those in favor?

927
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:46,430
Aye.

928
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:49,691
Motion passes.

929
01:32:49,711 --> 01:32:52,293
17-411 offered by Councilor Knight.

930
01:32:53,393 --> 01:33:10,082
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council thank Heidi Riccio for her four years of service to Medford Public Schools as vocational school principal and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council wish her all the best of luck in her new position at

931
01:33:10,943 --> 01:33:15,747
of Career and Technical Education Director at Essex Technical High School.

932
01:33:19,591 --> 01:33:20,211
Councilor Knight.

933
01:33:20,672 --> 01:33:22,133
Mr. President, thank you very much.

934
01:33:22,153 --> 01:33:24,255
I think I might need a box of tissues for this one.

935
01:33:25,015 --> 01:33:31,881
A couple of weeks ago we saw Director Riccio here and she put in a great presentation concerning the capital needs and a request for

936
01:33:33,141 --> 01:33:36,322
authorizing a grant proposal to go up to the Department of Education.

937
01:33:36,983 --> 01:33:45,146
And we all commented about the work that she's done in her short time here in Medford and how she's moved the vocational school eons and eons ahead of where it was.

938
01:33:45,206 --> 01:33:49,728
She's broke down the invisible wall between the high school and the vocational school.

939
01:33:49,768 --> 01:33:50,908
She's added programming.

940
01:33:51,549 --> 01:33:54,430
The programming that's been added has had a great impact on our bottom line.

941
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:59,292
It's had an ability to prevent kids from transferring out of district to go to other schools that provide

942
01:34:00,316 --> 01:34:02,298
programming that we didn't provide.

943
01:34:02,378 --> 01:34:13,766
So, Mr. President, it's with great sadness, but also great pleasure to see Heidi moving on to something that is really worthwhile and an opportunity that she can't say no to.

944
01:34:14,086 --> 01:34:17,569
But it's a great sadness to see her to go because she's done great things in the city of Medford.

945
01:34:18,149 --> 01:34:21,612
And it's really just too bad that we have to see her go.

946
01:34:21,652 --> 01:34:26,135
I wish we could have done more to recruit and keep her here, but we can't make people move closer to Medford, Mr. President.

947
01:34:26,175 --> 01:34:28,277
She had quite a commute coming in there every day.

948
01:34:29,016 --> 01:34:34,319
With that being said, I'd ask my colleagues to support this resolution and wish her the best of luck and thank her for her service to the city.

949
01:34:34,799 --> 01:34:35,120
Thank you.

950
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,161
Councillor Scarpelli.

951
01:34:37,521 --> 01:34:41,103
If I can, when the news broke, I did contact Ms.

952
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:57,032
Riccio and as she wept over the phone and the decisions she had to make, I think the key decision to make her in this move was that her family

953
01:34:57,698 --> 01:34:58,539
needed to come first.

954
01:34:58,599 --> 01:35:06,388
She had two children that she was commuting up to four hours a day, and her commute is now, would be 20 minutes.

955
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:17,480
Her commitment to finishing the projects that she envisioned and she shared with us in the last month, she has already told her future

956
01:35:18,303 --> 01:35:26,106
employer that she would make sure that she needs to finish those jobs and make sure they are completed before she moves on.

957
01:35:26,566 --> 01:35:28,647
That's typical Heidi Riccio.

958
01:35:30,348 --> 01:35:41,793
Again, being one of the school committee members that brought her to Medford and to see her vision come to fruition is

959
01:35:43,697 --> 01:35:44,277
was amazing.

960
01:35:44,357 --> 01:35:48,839
So I'm going to miss her in many different ways.

961
01:35:49,399 --> 01:35:58,642
She's been a great example how you can use different avenues to grow a major part of our community.

962
01:35:58,682 --> 01:35:59,762
That's our vocational school.

963
01:35:59,782 --> 01:36:03,464
So thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.

964
01:36:04,084 --> 01:36:05,584
And we also wish her luck.

965
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:07,785
Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelley.

966
01:36:07,805 --> 01:36:08,565
Councilor Falco.

967
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:09,946
Thank you, President Caviello.

968
01:36:10,226 --> 01:36:13,027
And also thank you to Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

969
01:36:14,075 --> 01:36:20,516
I had the opportunity, along with Councilor Scarpelli, when we were on the school committee, to hire Heidi Riccio.

970
01:36:21,196 --> 01:36:29,958
Hands down, I think one of the best moves that we made when we were on the school committee.

971
01:36:30,638 --> 01:36:31,978
Her commitment is unquestionable.

972
01:36:32,339 --> 01:36:38,440
The work that she did in four years to really turn that school around and to just bring

973
01:36:40,683 --> 01:36:42,584
vocational education back to life is amazing.

974
01:36:42,664 --> 01:36:50,227
I mean, the programs that she brought in, brought it to the school, the passion that she brings to the job is amazing.

975
01:36:50,707 --> 01:36:53,508
And she just did a phenomenal job over four years.

976
01:36:53,568 --> 01:36:55,189
She's going to definitely be missed.

977
01:36:55,989 --> 01:36:59,531
But she did a fabulous job while she was here.

978
01:36:59,651 --> 01:37:00,851
So I just want to say good luck.

979
01:37:01,572 --> 01:37:05,933
And I think, you know, I mean, it's hard to see her go, but family comes first.

980
01:37:05,993 --> 01:37:07,274
And I understand that completely.

981
01:37:07,474 --> 01:37:08,955
And I just want to wish her well.

982
01:37:09,295 --> 01:37:09,575
Thank you.

983
01:37:11,275 --> 01:37:11,995
Council Member Kern.

984
01:37:12,295 --> 01:37:13,635
Thank you, President Carvillo.

985
01:37:13,655 --> 01:37:16,656
I just want to thank Councilman Lai for bringing this forward.

986
01:37:16,676 --> 01:37:18,216
I thank Ms.

987
01:37:18,256 --> 01:37:19,837
Riccio for all the work she's done.

988
01:37:19,857 --> 01:37:23,898
It goes to show how much she has done.

989
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:34,880
When you have parents calling you upset that a director is leaving, so it goes to show all the hard work that she's put into the program, which she explained to us in part a few weeks ago.

990
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:38,951
she really impressed me before the council that night.

991
01:37:39,151 --> 01:37:43,312
And then a week later she is now leaving, but I wish her the best of luck.

992
01:37:43,352 --> 01:37:54,755
And I hope that we are able to find somebody as enthusiastic and hardworking as her to keep the programs alive and going strong and create more opportunities for our, our young, uh, younger generation.

993
01:37:54,795 --> 01:38:00,576
So I want to thank her for that and, and hope that we can fill her shoes to the best of our ability.

994
01:38:01,637 --> 01:38:01,957
Thank you.

995
01:38:01,977 --> 01:38:02,557
Counselor.

996
01:38:02,677 --> 01:38:03,417
Counselor Scapelli.

997
01:38:03,843 --> 01:38:08,585
Again, to that point, again, Mr. President, I know I forgot, but I wanted to make sure that when I talked to Ms.

998
01:38:08,605 --> 01:38:23,210
Riccio, one of the things she was so proud of was the fact that when we as a school committee years ago looked for a new director, I believe we classified the three finalists as used car salesmen.

999
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:28,972
And then coming across Heidi Riccio, what she mentioned to me that

1000
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:37,763
Four years ago, method wasn't even in the world of vocational education, wasn't even on the map.

1001
01:38:39,344 --> 01:38:51,750
And the interest gathered already from phone calls that vocational experts have been contacting her to apply for this job is astonishing.

1002
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:55,932
So I can't wait to see what happens, but I know she's definitely

1003
01:38:57,590 --> 01:39:00,212
helping with that piece, moving it forward.

1004
01:39:00,272 --> 01:39:05,336
So I want to let our parents know that it's definitely different than it was four years ago.

1005
01:39:05,817 --> 01:39:14,404
There'll be a line at the superintendent's door waiting to pass in their resumes for an opportunity to be the director of that program.

1006
01:39:14,524 --> 01:39:15,424
So, thank you.

1007
01:39:15,605 --> 01:39:17,146
Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

1008
01:39:17,966 --> 01:39:21,589
Very big shoes to fill there, and I wish her well on her new endeavor.

1009
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:25,172
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

1010
01:39:25,212 --> 01:39:25,893
All those in favor?

1011
01:39:26,798 --> 01:39:27,719
Motion passes.

1012
01:39:28,299 --> 01:39:31,782
Motion by Councilor Knight to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1013
01:39:33,543 --> 01:39:35,245
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1014
01:39:35,525 --> 01:39:40,348
All those in favor?

1015
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:40,729
Aye.

1016
01:39:40,749 --> 01:39:51,317
17-415 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council wish lifelong resident Muriel Sullivan a very happy 90th birthday.

1017
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:52,680
Councilor Knight.

1018
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:53,761
Yes, Mr. President.

1019
01:39:53,801 --> 01:39:55,882
Hopefully, Mary's still at home watching this evening.

1020
01:39:56,142 --> 01:40:00,265
I know we had a few things we had to take care of at the beginning of the meeting, and we couldn't take this up under suspension.

1021
01:40:01,085 --> 01:40:04,687
But Mary was born and raised in the city of Medford, has been a lifelong resident.

1022
01:40:04,867 --> 01:40:08,389
She raised her four children, Maureen, Paul, John, and Julie, here in the community.

1023
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:11,771
Her sister, Anne, still resides in Medford with her husband.

1024
01:40:12,472 --> 01:40:16,114
And she has three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

1025
01:40:16,154 --> 01:40:18,275
So we'd like to join me in wishing

1026
01:40:19,508 --> 01:40:19,688
Ms.

1027
01:40:19,728 --> 01:40:23,291
O'Sullivan, a very happy 90th birthday, Mr. President, and many more to come.

1028
01:40:23,872 --> 01:40:25,793
Thank you, Councilor Knight, and happy birthday.

1029
01:40:28,656 --> 01:40:40,186
Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that Mae Marbrek, founder of Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and GMAC Gym, be recognized for her 25 years of distinguished service.

1030
01:40:40,266 --> 01:40:41,207
Vice President Marks.

1031
01:40:42,067 --> 01:40:43,108
Thank you, Mr. President.

1032
01:40:43,208 --> 01:40:45,030
It's my honor to stand up for

1033
01:40:45,732 --> 01:40:48,615
such a tremendous person in this community.

1034
01:40:49,615 --> 01:40:56,101
We all know May Makibrecht very well for her passion and her commitment to this community.

1035
01:40:56,121 --> 01:41:02,566
You know, May was the founder of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and Gene Mack Gym.

1036
01:41:03,187 --> 01:41:06,790
And she served for the past 25 years as a board member.

1037
01:41:07,201 --> 01:41:19,530
I think that speaks volumes on her commitment, not only to Chevalier Auditorium, but also to the Meffitt Boys and Girls Club, which she was very passionate about, Mr. President.

1038
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:24,293
May also served as a board member on the Brooks Estates Land Trust.

1039
01:41:24,837 --> 01:41:37,246
I believe for still serving close to 18 or 19 years, a member of Cache and also the Method Arts Council and numerous other activities in the community.

1040
01:41:38,487 --> 01:41:39,447
May has been there.

1041
01:41:40,148 --> 01:41:47,993
She's someone that you can count on, someone that will always listen, Mr. President, and try to assist and never look for anything in return.

1042
01:41:48,794 --> 01:41:53,377
And I just want to really wish her well and honor her

1043
01:41:53,813 --> 01:42:02,680
before the Meffitt City Council for her many years of community service through a citation of this council, Mr. President.

1044
01:42:03,341 --> 01:42:18,194
And I would ask that that be done within the next week or so to get May up here and congratulate her for not only being the founding member of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium, but also for her commitment to the

1045
01:42:19,203 --> 01:42:20,744
community at large, Mr. President.

1046
01:42:20,964 --> 01:42:27,107
She is going to be honored at the next board meeting of the Friends of Chevalier, if anyone wants to go to that.

1047
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:28,348
Councilor Nice.

1048
01:42:29,349 --> 01:42:30,830
I second the resolution, Mr. President.

1049
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:31,510
Move for approval.

1050
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:35,312
I think it's also important to point out she is a member of the Medford Mustang Hall of Fame.

1051
01:42:36,413 --> 01:42:37,973
Former Citizen of the Year also.

1052
01:42:38,033 --> 01:42:38,974
Former Citizen of the Year.

1053
01:42:40,435 --> 01:42:41,215
Councilor Lockern.

1054
01:42:41,315 --> 01:42:42,396
Thank you, President Carviel.

1055
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:43,236
I was going to mention that.

1056
01:42:43,356 --> 01:42:44,677
Former Citizen of the Year.

1057
01:42:45,678 --> 01:42:45,998
May is

1058
01:42:46,604 --> 01:42:57,154
done so much for this city on a volunteer basis, which is a reason why she was the citizen of the year a few years back, and I want to thank her for her service.

1059
01:42:57,854 --> 01:43:00,637
She is being honored on May 18th at 7 p.m.

1060
01:43:00,657 --> 01:43:06,302
at Maple Park Condominiums Community Room, 65 Valley Street in Medford.

1061
01:43:07,082 --> 01:43:12,968
So whether we give her a citation here or at that meeting, I just want to thank her for all her service.

1062
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:14,500
Tremendous.

1063
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:15,501
Thank you, Councillor.

1064
01:43:15,701 --> 01:43:16,741
An outstanding woman.

1065
01:43:19,503 --> 01:43:23,525
Not only has she been a mentor to me, but she's been a good friend for many years.

1066
01:43:24,326 --> 01:43:25,006
Councillor Falco.

1067
01:43:25,306 --> 01:43:25,806
Thank you.

1068
01:43:25,826 --> 01:43:29,568
I just want to say thank you to May.

1069
01:43:29,588 --> 01:43:37,733
She's been an amazing citizen, been involved in so many organizations through the years, and her commitment is fabulous.

1070
01:43:37,993 --> 01:43:42,395
She's done a great job, and I just want to say thank you for all your service to our community.

1071
01:43:43,881 --> 01:43:50,863
On the motion by Councilor Marks that we have made my brick, uh, come up here for a citation, uh, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1072
01:43:51,924 --> 01:43:52,664
All those in favor.

1073
01:43:53,644 --> 01:43:54,464
Motion passes.

1074
01:43:56,365 --> 01:43:57,645
Offered by vice president marks.

1075
01:43:57,725 --> 01:44:08,169
We have resolved that the tree stumps located at 51 woods road, 56 woods road in 18 Wellington road be removed.

1076
01:44:08,829 --> 01:44:09,889
Vice president marks.

1077
01:44:10,829 --> 01:44:11,890
Thank you, Mr. President.

1078
01:44:12,270 --> 01:44:12,350
Um,

1079
01:44:13,737 --> 01:44:25,245
There are still a number of stumps, Mr. President, throughout this community that appear to be on the stump list but, for whatever reason, are taking forever to remove from in front of residents' homes.

1080
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:35,513
These are three that were brought to my attention just recently over the weekend, and I know there are literally tens and tens more, Mr. President.

1081
01:44:35,533 --> 01:44:40,877
I would ask that these be removed immediately in the interest of public safety.

1082
01:44:41,337 --> 01:44:44,539
And also, Mr. President, that we receive an updated list.

1083
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:53,065
We were asked, I believe it was eight months ago, maybe a year, for monies to do sidewalk and stump removal.

1084
01:44:53,445 --> 01:45:07,695
If we can get an updated list on where we stand with that, and the age of the stumps, as we've talked about, Mr. President, ad nauseum before this council, and that we get a report back from the Commissioner Brian Kerentz.

1085
01:45:08,773 --> 01:45:09,593
Council Member Keran.

1086
01:45:09,853 --> 01:45:11,014
Thank you, President Carviello.

1087
01:45:12,154 --> 01:45:13,754
Thank you for bringing this up, Council Member Marks.

1088
01:45:13,814 --> 01:45:20,856
I also have been getting repeated emails if we could add 17, 48, and 61 Doonan Street.

1089
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:33,840
Those stumps have been there for a very long time and I did request through an email to Mr. Keran's that they would be removed if we could get a status on that and vote in favor of removing those stumps.

1090
01:45:34,676 --> 01:45:41,358
people get sick and tired of stumps in their neighborhoods and on their streets, and it's understandable, it's an eyesore.

1091
01:45:41,919 --> 01:45:46,660
So if we could get those removed, it's also a public safety issue, so thank you.

1092
01:45:48,001 --> 01:45:48,581
Councilor Knight.

1093
01:45:49,001 --> 01:45:50,022
Yes, Mr. President.

1094
01:45:50,082 --> 01:45:52,283
Thank you very much, Councilor Moxley, for bringing this resolution forward.

1095
01:45:52,323 --> 01:46:00,906
I, too, had a conversation with Public Works Director Cairns this afternoon, and he's informed me that there will be two sidewalk crews that will be out in the coming weeks.

1096
01:46:01,446 --> 01:46:04,307
One of the crews is a city crew, one of the crews is a National Grid crew.

1097
01:46:05,128 --> 01:46:19,781
The national grid crew will be dealing with sidewalk panels that they've disturbed during their construction over the last year, and the city crew will be working on the stump and sidewalk money that we appropriated some months back, Mr. President.

1098
01:46:20,081 --> 01:46:21,703
But I appreciate the resolution going forward.

1099
01:46:21,723 --> 01:46:23,324
I support it wholeheartedly, and I move for approval.

1100
01:46:23,904 --> 01:46:24,585
Councilor Fevella.

1101
01:46:25,626 --> 01:46:26,507
Thank you, President Caviello.

1102
01:46:26,527 --> 01:46:28,568
I just want to thank Councilor Moxley for bringing this forward.

1103
01:46:28,609 --> 01:46:31,331
If we could also add 23 Fulton Street to the list.

1104
01:46:34,607 --> 01:46:49,673
I got a call about that recently, and I'm glad, and actually, I believe the list that Councilor Moxson mentioned was supposed to be forwarded to us a while ago, so I'm glad that you mentioned that as well, because we should get an updated list to see what kind of progress is being made.

1105
01:46:50,133 --> 01:46:51,774
A lot of money has gone into this, so.

1106
01:46:52,654 --> 01:46:52,974
Thank you.

1107
01:46:53,014 --> 01:46:53,314
Thank you.

1108
01:46:54,795 --> 01:47:02,938
On the motion by Councilor, by Vice President Mox, as amended by Councilor Longo Kern and Councilor Falco,

1109
01:47:03,577 --> 01:47:05,498
and seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

1110
01:47:06,218 --> 01:47:07,058
All those in favor?

1111
01:47:07,079 --> 01:47:07,139
Aye.

1112
01:47:08,299 --> 01:47:09,379
Motion passes.

1113
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:28,688
Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the city administration provide a copy of the city's affordable housing plan and be it further resolved that the city report back to the council that the percentage of housing units in the city that are considered affordable.

1114
01:47:28,788 --> 01:47:29,528
Councilor Knight.

1115
01:47:30,753 --> 01:47:32,013
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1116
01:47:32,053 --> 01:47:35,574
There's been much discussion about development in the community, much discussion about zoning.

1117
01:47:36,815 --> 01:47:48,038
One thing that we all need to be wary of is Chapter 40B of the General Laws, which allows developers to bypass the local zoning laws if the city of Medford is not at its threshold established by the state standard for affordable housing.

1118
01:47:48,658 --> 01:47:53,019
So I'd ask that the administration provide those reports to us so that we can take a look at them as we prepare our discussions.

1119
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:54,880
Thank you.

1120
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:57,921
On the motion by Councilor Naif, seconded by Councilor De La

1121
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:00,241
All those in favour?

1122
01:48:01,101 --> 01:48:02,022
Motion passes.

1123
01:48:03,543 --> 01:48:09,007
If I can set a reminder out, Saturday is Clippership Day in the City of Medford.

1124
01:48:09,968 --> 01:48:17,574
If everyone can come out and attend, it's something that's been brought back, that's been gone for a while, and I hope everybody can attend.

1125
01:48:18,034 --> 01:48:18,895
Councillor Langel-Kern.

1126
01:48:19,592 --> 01:48:19,812
Thank you.

1127
01:48:19,852 --> 01:48:25,717
I just had a feeling you were going to maybe forget the details by the way you were ending that.

1128
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:27,739
12 p.m.

1129
01:48:27,799 --> 01:48:37,367
to 9 p.m., right in the center of Medford Square, there's going to be a cornhole tournament, a number of activities for the children, beer and wine, a stage.

1130
01:48:37,787 --> 01:48:40,129
You may know better more of what's going on on the stage.

1131
01:48:40,189 --> 01:48:40,690
I forget.

1132
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:43,552
But it's going to be a great family event.

1133
01:48:43,772 --> 01:48:45,334
The street's going to be closed off.

1134
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:51,619
parking won't, I don't think parking is going to be an issue if that, that issue was cleared up, but it's going to be a great day.

1135
01:48:51,639 --> 01:48:54,480
A lot of family fun and, um, great community day.

1136
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:55,680
Good community fun.

1137
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:57,520
Thank you.

1138
01:48:59,581 --> 01:49:00,321
Vice-president Mox.

1139
01:49:01,081 --> 01:49:08,903
Just if I could, Mr. President, I had the opportunity this past Saturday to attend the community cleanup, uh, which we refer to as earth day.

1140
01:49:10,736 --> 01:49:15,878
We had cleanups in Haines Square, West Meffitt Square, right here in the heart of Meffitt Square.

1141
01:49:16,318 --> 01:49:20,720
The Brooks Estates held a cleanup, McDonnell Park along the Mystic River.

1142
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,921
And there were many, many volunteers out that day.

1143
01:49:23,941 --> 01:49:25,742
It was a beautiful day.

1144
01:49:26,522 --> 01:49:30,384
The Mystic River Watershed Association had many volunteers.

1145
01:49:30,884 --> 01:49:36,126
Meffitt Community Coalition organized their group and they did a tremendous job here in Meffitt Square.

1146
01:49:36,886 --> 01:49:38,047
The Chamber of Commerce,

1147
01:49:38,597 --> 01:49:46,423
Also was very instrumental, members of MBELT, help at the Brooks Estates, and DPW.

1148
01:49:46,463 --> 01:49:59,332
I just want to thank personally Steve Tanaglia, who did a tremendous job, Mr. President, in making sure that there were brooms and rakes and bags and things were picked up after all this trash was picked up.

1149
01:49:59,712 --> 01:50:03,695
So I want to thank everyone in the community for a great cleanup day.

1150
01:50:04,455 --> 01:50:06,877
And secondly, Mr. President,

1151
01:50:07,424 --> 01:50:11,827
I think it's only appropriate that the farmer's market will be moving.

1152
01:50:12,587 --> 01:50:21,432
We all know it's been in Meffitt Square for a number of years, and they have a new location, which will be the Condon Shell on Mystic Valley Parkway.

1153
01:50:22,193 --> 01:50:27,736
And the first farmer's market will be June 8th, and it's gonna run until October 12th.

1154
01:50:28,276 --> 01:50:30,317
It's gonna be from three to seven p.m.

1155
01:50:31,078 --> 01:50:33,799
every Thursday from June 8th to October 12th.

1156
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:36,581
And there's plenty of parking there,

1157
01:50:37,598 --> 01:50:43,901
running water and electricity, and supposedly it's going to be a great location for the market itself.

1158
01:50:45,142 --> 01:50:48,764
Also, Mr. President, I just want to bring up Circle the Square.

1159
01:50:49,464 --> 01:50:59,989
We all know that for several weeks during the June-July months, I believe up until August, they run Circle the Square.

1160
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:02,991
This year, they're only going to run it once.

1161
01:51:03,791 --> 01:51:06,913
There's going to be one Circle the Square date, that is Thursday,

1162
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:09,671
June 15th from 3.30 to 7.30.

1163
01:51:11,373 --> 01:51:34,127
And the reasoning they're only going to have one is because there is exciting renovations being made on Riverside Plaza, on Riverside F. And I guess for that reason, Circle the Square will only have one date this year, which I'm not sure why they can't use other parts of the square, but that's the notice that went out.

1164
01:51:34,747 --> 01:51:36,248
Also, Mr. President, if I could,

1165
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,201
I have a wealth of knowledge tonight.

1166
01:51:38,481 --> 01:51:38,781
What's that?

1167
01:51:38,961 --> 01:51:39,862
Wealth of knowledge tonight.

1168
01:51:40,002 --> 01:51:41,643
Well, it's important, Mr. President.

1169
01:51:42,924 --> 01:51:46,286
Upcoming events, Cachet has an arts and cultural calendar.

1170
01:51:47,127 --> 01:51:49,869
Back pocket dances, I think Councilor Scott Pelley.

1171
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:54,372
I've heard people say you're in the back pocket, is it not dances?

1172
01:51:54,512 --> 01:51:56,033
No, it's dance.

1173
01:51:56,113 --> 01:51:57,834
Oh, it's dance, okay.

1174
01:51:57,954 --> 01:52:01,156
Back pocket dances, Saturday, May 6th from 3 p.m.

1175
01:52:01,236 --> 01:52:01,656
and 7.30 p.m.

1176
01:52:04,461 --> 01:52:28,408
at the Meffitt Senior Center, 101 Riverside Ave, and then Bluegrass and Beyond, I think Councilor De La Russa likes Bluegrass, a night of American music, and that's gonna be Saturday, May 13th, at Chevalier Theater at 8 p.m., Mr. President, all welcomed, and the Friends of the Meffitt Public Library book sale, Saturday, May 20th, and Sunday, the 21st, at all various times.

1177
01:52:29,829 --> 01:52:31,749
And that's all for today, Mr. President.

1178
01:52:31,769 --> 01:52:32,570
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1179
01:52:34,141 --> 01:52:37,123
Mr. President, I'm very surprised that counselor marks missed one.

1180
01:52:38,124 --> 01:52:39,365
The airplane noise meeting.

1181
01:52:39,425 --> 01:52:39,766
That's right.

1182
01:52:39,826 --> 01:52:42,488
Monday, Monday night, 7 p.m.

1183
01:52:42,748 --> 01:52:48,112
in the council chambers and our representatives from the mass port CLC will be there.

1184
01:52:49,213 --> 01:52:49,514
Thank you.

1185
01:52:49,554 --> 01:52:51,275
Counselor.

1186
01:52:51,435 --> 01:52:51,855
Thank you.

1187
01:52:52,056 --> 01:52:53,217
Uh, president.

1188
01:52:54,057 --> 01:53:00,062
I actually, I am surprised that everyone missed this one, but tomorrow night is the method police community meeting.

1189
01:53:00,382 --> 01:53:02,945
Uh, it is at the Bedford senior center and it starts at 6 p.m.

1190
01:53:04,114 --> 01:53:04,914
Everyone is welcome.

1191
01:53:05,215 --> 01:53:05,555
Thank you.

1192
01:53:05,635 --> 01:53:10,677
Oh, and if I may really quick, um, I was also at the, uh, cleanup this weekend in the square.

1193
01:53:10,717 --> 01:53:15,279
So thank you to the, uh, community coalition and to the DPW department as well.

1194
01:53:15,299 --> 01:53:16,359
Everybody did a fine job.

1195
01:53:16,599 --> 01:53:17,960
Many of our city council were there.

1196
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:21,221
Did you, would you like to speak?

1197
01:53:21,281 --> 01:53:22,482
Name and address for the record, please.

1198
01:53:22,522 --> 01:53:25,003
Valerie Geiselman, Medford, Massachusetts.

1199
01:53:25,283 --> 01:53:28,665
I wanted to thank councilor Marks for just giving a list of all those dates.

1200
01:53:28,725 --> 01:53:31,646
And I wondered if there's a place where we can find easily,

1201
01:53:32,053 --> 01:53:34,895
find all the dates of the events that are happening in Medford.

1202
01:53:35,435 --> 01:53:36,756
And I'll tell you my reason why.

1203
01:53:37,637 --> 01:53:41,640
On the way here to the meeting, I stopped in at this new restaurant.

1204
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:43,341
And I think it's pronounced Zam Zam.

1205
01:53:43,921 --> 01:53:47,584
And they have Pakistani and Indian cuisine.

1206
01:53:47,604 --> 01:53:49,125
It's the second time I've stopped in there.

1207
01:53:49,565 --> 01:53:51,046
And they seem like a lovely place.

1208
01:53:51,466 --> 01:53:55,969
I asked them if they knew about participating in the June 4 event, Medford Day.

1209
01:53:56,049 --> 01:53:57,110
They didn't even know about it.

1210
01:53:57,590 --> 01:53:59,271
And I mentioned a few other things to them.

1211
01:53:59,652 --> 01:54:01,013
And when the new petitioners

1212
01:54:01,975 --> 01:54:10,542
We're also speaking tonight, the ones that are, let's see, taking over the, I'm trying to see.

1213
01:54:10,562 --> 01:54:11,943
Pinky's Pizza and Helen's Roast Beef.

1214
01:54:12,503 --> 01:54:12,924
What'd you say?

1215
01:54:13,304 --> 01:54:15,105
Pinky's Pizza and Helen's Roast Beef.

1216
01:54:15,926 --> 01:54:20,309
Yes, Pinky's Pizza and Helen's Roast Beef.

1217
01:54:20,369 --> 01:54:30,057
And I went out to speak to them and welcomed them to Medford and I was so happy some of these are in my neighborhood and I'd be happy when they're opening up and the places aren't empty anymore.

1218
01:54:30,423 --> 01:54:33,724
And I asked them about June 4th, if they would be interested in participating.

1219
01:54:33,784 --> 01:54:34,905
And they didn't even know about it.

1220
01:54:34,965 --> 01:54:39,846
And they didn't know about the events that happen up at Tufts College, where they might be able to participate.

1221
01:54:40,207 --> 01:54:46,129
And I just wonder if there's any way we could have some ambassadors to welcome these new businesses in Medford.

1222
01:54:46,189 --> 01:54:47,869
It's so wonderful to have them coming in.

1223
01:54:47,889 --> 01:54:54,292
And we know what a risk it is for, especially young people or anybody, any age, to start a new business in Medford.

1224
01:54:54,312 --> 01:54:54,852
That would be you.

1225
01:54:57,378 --> 01:54:57,719
Thank you.

1226
01:54:59,519 --> 01:55:00,659
How about the high school kids?

1227
01:55:00,699 --> 01:55:01,980
I mean, this is a wonderful thing.

1228
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,140
We have a chamber of commerce.

1229
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:04,420
There's Facebook.

1230
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:10,362
There's multiple outlets for these people to, multiple resources for them to find out.

1231
01:55:10,402 --> 01:55:11,582
But they don't know about them.

1232
01:55:11,662 --> 01:55:13,023
And I think we need to reach out.
