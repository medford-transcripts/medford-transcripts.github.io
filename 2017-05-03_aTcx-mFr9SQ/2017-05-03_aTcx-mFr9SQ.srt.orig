1
00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:04,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Investments in our school children continue today.

2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:19,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Augmented security measures in our centers would not be possible without the collaboration with our public safety professionals.

3
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:25,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Safety is a core component to an individual's comfort in and desire to be in a community.

4
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:31,941
[SPEAKER_05]: We have invested in state-of-the-art self-contained breathing apparatus for our firefighters and a second set of turnout gear.

5
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:36,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Medford City Council for voting that last night, for supporting this initiative.

6
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:42,906
[SPEAKER_05]: These are to provide the most current apparatus for firefighters' safety and ultimately for your safety.

7
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:48,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Nine new firefighters graduated the academy last month and one entered this past Monday.

8
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,891
[SPEAKER_05]: We are working hard to keep up with retirements by accelerating the civil service process.

9
00:00:55,516 --> 00:01:08,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Kudos to our Board of Health for receipt of a seven-year, 100,000 per year grant from the Mass Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Abuse to provide opiate abuse prevention services for six cities and towns in our area.

10
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:21,815
[SPEAKER_05]: We all understand the impact this drug has on our society, and we are making every effort to raise awareness, erase the stigma, and provide assistance for those suffering from addiction, as well as support for their families.

11
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:38,970
[SPEAKER_05]: We have formed a team approach under Mary Ann O'Connor, who recently came to us in the last several months, for our prevention and outreach.

12
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,312
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an outreach manager, a recovery coach, we work with Lawrence Murrell Hospital, and the police department.

13
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:52,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Every life matters, and we thank our police and firefighters for volunteering to administer NACAN in this cause.

14
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:54,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

15
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And while we are not to clear the trust at Citi, be assured that our police department protocols do not allow for profiling.

16
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:12,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Witnesses and victims are not asked about their immigration status.

17
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:15,064
[SPEAKER_05]: So be sure and ask your lawyer.

18
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:26,247
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can ask me what the question posed to me most often,

19
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:31,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have to say, it's when are we getting a new police station?

20
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear day in and day out.

21
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:45,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And today, just this morning, I announced that we will be submitting a loan order to the city council next week on February 14th, requesting funds to commission an architect to begin the plans for a new station.

22
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:49,700
[SPEAKER_05]: We have turned the city upside down looking for a new location.

23
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,061
[SPEAKER_05]: We've toured commercial spaces.

24
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,062
[SPEAKER_05]: We've contacted property owners.

25
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Property owners have contacted us.

26
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:05,481
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the end, the right location with no land cost and no relocation during construction is the current site of the training facility on Main Street.

27
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:34,807
[SPEAKER_05]: The current facility will be demolished, and the proposed 35,000 square foot, three-story new construction will house all amenities of the state-of-the-art resilient headquarters, including deserved equal space for our female and male officers, technology upgrades, and most importantly, safe interior space for our office's well-being.

28
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:37,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Public safety investments continue today.

29
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,884
[SPEAKER_05]: In conclusion, this city of ours, this great city of ours, continues to move forward on a foundation built on dialogue.

30
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:05,668
[SPEAKER_05]: A dialogue that echoes in this building, allowing the voices of all residents to be heard with an attitude of inclusion and fairness.

31
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:13,112
[SPEAKER_05]: A dialogue of renewal, where creative and imaginative ideas are brought forward to better the quality of life in our city.

32
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:22,222
[SPEAKER_05]: A dialogue that resonates with the message that Medford is on the move, embracing a future of possibilities, embracing a future of hope.

33
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:30,666
[SPEAKER_05]: On this night, in our beautiful City Hall, and I say that the state of our city is sound, it is stable, and it is sturdy.

34
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:52,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And as your mayor, I stand as committed as ever to foster this dialogue with you as we continue to cultivate a city on which we can be partners in progress.

35
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,601
[SPEAKER_05]: God bless Medford, the commonwealth, and the United States of America.

36
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:02,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all very much for being here this evening, and good night, and be safe tomorrow with the upcoming blizzard.

37
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

38
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:42,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Please remain standing.

39
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,987
[SPEAKER_11]: And for the final invocation and benediction, we invite Reverend Wendy.

40
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

41
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:56,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you inspired?

42
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:14,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking, I don't like the sound stable and sturdy, because that sounds so sound, stable and sturdy.

43
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:23,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was thinking that it felt pretty spectacular and scintillating and safe for all and Stephanie.

44
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,882
[SPEAKER_06]: to do something for me, citizens of Medford.

45
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:43,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if, for just a minute, we can have all of our elected and staff, city staff, sit down for a second.

46
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:45,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Elected and city staff.

47
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:50,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody else, I'm gonna ask you to help me bless these people.

48
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:57,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you just extend a hand towards the people who are serving you today?

49
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:00,956
[SPEAKER_06]: for it continues today.

50
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:03,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And join me in the spirit of blessing.

51
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:27,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, loving, forgiving spirit of the universe, God of all that is, God of this city, God of these people, God of goodness and change and sturdiness and future and yesterday and today, it continues.

52
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:35,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we ask your blessing on these good people who we have elected and we have given the responsibility to serve us.

53
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:48,241
[SPEAKER_06]: We thank you for their wisdom, for their courage, for the day-to-day doing it all to make us sturdy and stable and sound.

54
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:53,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Help them to be courageous as we go from this night.

55
00:07:53,682 --> 00:08:07,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Help them to be that which we need in this city to make us scintillating and exciting and future-oriented at the same time that we are grounded in all that we have been.

56
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:12,777
[SPEAKER_06]: God, we thank you, and we ask your blessing on all of these people.

57
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:15,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, if you'll all stand back up.

58
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I will bless us all.

59
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:22,908
[SPEAKER_06]: May God continue today to bless us and keep us.

60
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:30,950
[SPEAKER_06]: May God continue today to show us the way and to be gracious to us, to shine upon us.

61
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,772
[SPEAKER_06]: May God continue today to look upon Medford with kindness and grace and love.

62
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And we pray all of this in the name of love.

63
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:43,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Let the people say amen.

64
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,091
[SPEAKER_11]: she prayed.

65
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:04,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Lieutenant Casey, retire the colors.

66
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Prepare to halt.

67
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,600
Order, halt.

68
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:41,022
Halt.

69
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:48,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all, and the mayor kindly invites you to gather for some refreshments, some pastries and some coffee out in the rotunda.

70
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,595
[SPEAKER_11]: The munchkins out there have eaten them all up by now.

71
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:30,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

72
00:25:30,753 --> 00:25:34,474

96
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:22,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Communications from the mayor, 17414, please.

97
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:23,247

98
00:26:38,971 --> 00:26:45,012
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-414 to the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council.

99
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:53,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Mr. President, City Council, I respectfully request to recommend that your honorable body approve the following transfer of funds.

100
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:54,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Amount, 22,400 from account 010-102-5110-1112.

101
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:55,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Account 010-151-5110.

102
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:30,092
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose of this transfer is to appropriate the funds for the assistant city solicitor position as classification was changed from CAF 10, CAF 12 per request of the city council during the fiscal 17 budget deliberations.

103
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:39,416
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, solicitor Romley had a request in this budget narrative that the law office assistant position be reclassified from CAF 3,

104
00:27:40,332 --> 00:27:41,193
[SPEAKER_04]: to see a four.

105
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:42,414
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a run lead.

106
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,816
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be here to answer any questions that we may have.

107
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:54,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor DelaRusso of approval on the motion by Councilor of DelaRusso.

108
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

109
00:27:56,864 --> 00:27:59,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Mr. President, this appears to be housekeeping to me.

110
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:04,070
[SPEAKER_09]: The council had voted to approve a change in the classification of the assistant city solicitor during last year's budget debates.

111
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and this looks like it's housekeeping to make sure that the accounts line up.

112
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:10,159
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping that the city solicitor will be able to come up here and confirm that.

113
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:12,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'd be happy to second council Della Russo's motion.

114
00:28:14,404 --> 00:28:15,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Solicitor.

115
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

116
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I was distracted.

117
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:21,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

118
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:23,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I am Mr. Solicitor.

119
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:24,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine.

120
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:24,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

121
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:28,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the question that I would like to have it back, um, would be,

122
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,221
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just a housekeeping matter.

123
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:35,625
[SPEAKER_09]: During the budget debates last year, we voted to approve an increase in the salary of the Assistant City Solicitor.

124
00:28:35,645 --> 00:28:38,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just a- Yes, this is the appropriation which would take care of the increase.

125
00:28:39,027 --> 00:28:39,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

126
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:41,229
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really the long and short of it.

127
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:45,372
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been nice if this had been done concurrently with the reclassification, but it wasn't.

128
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:52,417
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is necessary in order for us to be able to finish the fiscal year, everything square.

129
00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:58,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, based on that explanation, I would second Councilor De La Russo's motion for approval.

130
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:03,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Solicitor, is this not a change of classification?

131
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:04,075
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is not.

132
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:14,120
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to fund the change in classification that was presented by Councilor Lungo Kern back last year at the beginning of the budgetary year, dealing with the Assistant City Solicitor.

133
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, it is not a classification change.

134
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:19,462
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to fund the change that was made.

135
00:29:19,763 --> 00:29:20,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

136
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:24,345
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

137
00:29:26,386 --> 00:29:26,966
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

138
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:29,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

139
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor DelaRosso?

140
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:34,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

141
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco?

142
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:36,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

143
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:37,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Naik?

144
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:37,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

145
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:38,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Locker?

146
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:39,993

150
00:29:43,135 --> 00:29:43,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

151
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:44,656
[SPEAKER_10]: President Caviello?

152
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:45,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

153
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:48,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

154
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:49,238

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Solis.

156
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:51,560

160
00:29:56,682 --> 00:29:57,523
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're on suspension,

161
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:18,019
[SPEAKER_04]: 17351.

162
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:18,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve the combining of the Water Enterprise Fund and the Sewer Enterprise Fund into one enterprise fund per Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 53, F12.

163
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,843
[SPEAKER_04]: To that end, I recommend your approval of the following resolution be it resolved that the City of Medford accepts

164
00:30:28,322 --> 00:30:50,696
[SPEAKER_04]: the provisions of chapter 44 section 53 F one, two of the Massachusetts general laws and combines the water enterprise fund and the sewer enterprise fund into one enterprise fund effective fiscal year 2018 attached is the combined water and sewer enterprise funds memorandum that was provided to the water and sewer commission.

165
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:57,460
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you like highlighting benefits of consolidating two enterprise funds into one enterprise fund?

166
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:03,589
[SPEAKER_04]: A letter from the Water and Sewer Commission is provided, which demonstrates their support.

167
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:11,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Finance Director Alicia Nunley is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter sincerely.

168
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:12,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Stephanie Burke.

169
00:31:13,115 --> 00:31:13,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

170
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:16,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor DelaRusso.

171
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:24,062
[SPEAKER_11]: As this paper was tabled some weeks ago, we've had sufficient time to review, inquire, and as a whole,

172
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:29,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to this week move approval.

173
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:30,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

174
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:32,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Knight.

175
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:34,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

176
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:44,297
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my understanding that this matter was brought forward by the administration in an effort to reduce the duplication of efforts and to streamline some of the accounting principles and practices that they have in the office downstairs.

177
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:49,620
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a finance director here, and maybe she can confirm that and talk a little bit about how this is going to work.

178
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll be happy to second Counselor DelaRusso's motion, provided that the questions are answered appropriately.

179
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:54,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

180
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:55,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the director, please.

181
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:02,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, honorable counselors, Alicia Nunley, finance director for the city of Medford and through the chair to counselor Knight.

182
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:04,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, yes, this would be streamlining.

183
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:07,143
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole accounting would be a lot easier.

184
00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:12,826
[SPEAKER_12]: We would still have two revenue streams to count for the sewer and water, but all expenses would be shared between the two.

185
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:15,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

186
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:20,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm satisfied with the explanation that the, uh, finance director gave a couple of weeks ago.

187
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:26,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, this couple, but the committee of the whole meeting that we had and the reinforcement of such and her statement again this evening would lead me to

188
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:30,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that this is something that I can support, and I would second Councilor DelaRusso's motion for approval.

189
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:30,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

190
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:35,455
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

191
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:41,477
[SPEAKER_21]: Name and address of the record, please.

192
00:32:41,637 --> 00:32:45,059
[SPEAKER_21]: Robert Penza, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party.

193
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:49,940
[SPEAKER_21]: I can appreciate the fact that you folks want to incorporate the water and sewer account together, and as Ms.

194
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,002
[SPEAKER_21]: Notley just indicated, you got permission from the Department of Revenue, from my understanding.

195
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:54,642
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that correct?

196
00:32:55,965 --> 00:33:04,427
[SPEAKER_21]: But with that being said, the water and sewer rate does have a section in there that talks about any surplus that's in there for a period of time.

197
00:33:05,187 --> 00:33:18,510
[SPEAKER_21]: And if, in fact, the surplus is not being used for a project that will begin within a 90-day period of time, and they're sitting on approximately $8 million, that those monies should be returned back to the Medford taxpayers.

198
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:25,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, you just had a committee of the whole meeting tonight to talk about a new connectivity charge that is being proposed by the Water and Sewer Department.

199
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:31,297
[SPEAKER_21]: but there was no discussion as it related to what's gonna happen to the eight and a half million dollars that's out there.

200
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:54,337
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would like to make a strong suggestion that the council amend your vote or make it a B paper asking either for the city solicitor, I mean for the city engineer and or the water and sewer department to have a plan presented to folks ready to go within 90 days or that those monies are revert back to the Metro taxpayers.

201
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:56,334
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's just fear.

202
00:33:56,815 --> 00:34:01,716
[SPEAKER_21]: We keep talking and we keep hearing over and beyond, over and over, that we have money in this surplus account.

203
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:06,057
[SPEAKER_21]: And as it was explained to us— Point of information.

204
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:06,617
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselor Knight.

205
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:20,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I correct that the paper before us is as to whether or not we want to combine the accounts, not whether or not we're really looking at how the accounts are utilized, but whether or not we're really just allowing the finance director to combine the two accounts for accounting purposes and to eliminate duplication of efforts?

206
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:20,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

207
00:34:20,782 --> 00:34:21,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

208
00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:22,062
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the purpose of the paper.

209
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:31,117
[SPEAKER_21]: And besides having it for accounting purposes, there is a usage factor in there by emerging the two, which also has a surplus of eight and a half or thereabouts millions of dollars.

210
00:34:31,677 --> 00:34:40,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, if the city has no intention of using that money for a project ready to go within 90 days, the money, according to the law, needs to be returned back to the taxpayers.

211
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:50,283
[SPEAKER_21]: So what I respectfully ask any one of my colleagues, or was in a joint motion, that the city sit down immediately to find out if there is going to be a project within 90 days that's going to be operational.

212
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:50,703
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't forget.

213
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,081
[SPEAKER_21]: For years, this money's been sitting there.

214
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:57,664
[SPEAKER_21]: So as a result of that, it's either use it or give it back.

215
00:34:57,984 --> 00:35:05,949
[SPEAKER_21]: It's unfortunate that you have accumulated that kind of an account with that kind of money, but not any ongoing projects ready to go for that money to be utilized.

216
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:12,333
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that just fits into the parameters of the way the law was written.

217
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:15,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

218
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:18,937
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Nights.

219

366
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:39,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by Councilor Knight, I'm sorry, by Councilor Mox to revert back to regular business.

367
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:53,482
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-407 offered by Vice President Mox, whereas the West Manfred parking lot, which consists of 35 customer parking spots, will be closed for an extended period of time due to the treatment of

368
00:40:54,342 --> 00:41:12,673
[SPEAKER_04]: underground contaminants be it resolved that the bus stop in front of 440 High Street at Bogginsport Liquors be temporarily located between Brookline Bank and 422 High Street in the interest of adding additional parking for the West Medford businesses.

369
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:14,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Marks.

370
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:16,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

371
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:19,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the opportunity last week to attend

372
00:41:20,462 --> 00:41:30,447
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, a business, uh, neighborhood meeting, uh, regarding the, uh, proposed work that's going to be done at bargain spot Lickers, the West method parking lot.

373
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:48,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it has been mentioned before this council on a number of occasions, uh, there has been a contamination found underground and, uh, the city is in the process of removing the contaminants, uh, through a high water, uh, injection, uh, multiple injections,

374
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,334
[SPEAKER_03]: into the ground over a sustained period of time.

375
00:41:53,215 --> 00:41:58,962
[SPEAKER_03]: While this takes place, Mr. President, we were told by the city engineer as well as the chief of police.

376
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:15,601
[SPEAKER_03]: and as well as the consultant that was hired by the city that this parking lot will not be able to have any parking accommodations for a three phased approach.

377
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:19,465
[SPEAKER_03]: The first phase I believe will last at least

378
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:38,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was 21 to 30 days that was mentioned of injections, followed by a phase two process, depending on how successful they are with phase one, that could range anywhere from five to 10 days, depending on what's left over, and then an eventual phase three.

379
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:48,583
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why I offer this resolution, Mr. President, is the parking lot behind the Bargain Spot Liquors is a place where many

380
00:42:49,464 --> 00:43:08,722
[SPEAKER_03]: patrons park to frequent the West Meffitt businesses and actually many businesses will also use that as a place where deliveries could be had, a place where people can come and do some temporary parking to run in and

381
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:12,260
[SPEAKER_03]: do deliveries and other things in the area.

382
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:21,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we remove these 35 spots, it's gonna become increasingly difficult for people to come in and traverse this area.

383
00:43:21,944 --> 00:43:29,567
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a plan by the police department to relax some of the parking restrictions in the area for a period of time.

384
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:37,350
[SPEAKER_03]: There's discussion about also using the tip of Playstead Park for some additional parking.

385
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:54,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And this resolution actually was from business owners that approached me after the meeting asking that if we could temporarily relocate the bus stop in front of Bargain Spot Liquors, they could pick up four spots in the heart of West Medford Square.

386
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:57,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And we took a walk along the area.

387
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:03,294
[SPEAKER_03]: We took a walk up to 422 High Street and also in front of Brookline Bank.

388
00:44:03,914 --> 00:44:06,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we found a perfect location

389
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:15,458
[SPEAKER_03]: temporary location that's handicap accessible, because that'll be the first thing the MBTA requires of the city if we move the spot.

390
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:23,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And indeed, we did see accessibility ramps on the corner of Canal and High Street.

391
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:35,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would ask at this time, Mr. President, in the interest of providing more parking at a time that it's needed in West Medford Square, that this council vote tonight

392
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:49,163
[SPEAKER_03]: to request immediately that the MBTA go out there and move the spot between Brookline Bank and 422 High Street in the interest of adding additional parking spots in West Meffitt Square.

393
00:44:49,683 --> 00:45:01,906
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a number of the business owners, Mr. President, that would like to, I think one or two would like to come up and say a few words regarding how important this is to business and the general vicinity.

394
00:45:03,006 --> 00:45:04,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this time, if we can allow

395
00:45:05,885 --> 00:45:07,326
[SPEAKER_03]: business owners to get up, Mr. President.

396
00:45:07,446 --> 00:45:08,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

397
00:45:08,788 --> 00:45:10,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Would anyone like to speak in this matter?

398
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:14,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

399
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:15,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

400
00:45:15,653 --> 00:45:17,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny Roach, 64 Bower Street, Medford.

401
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:19,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I own CB Scoops.

402
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:26,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been asking, actually, for this bus stop to be moved quite a bit for quite a few years.

403
00:45:27,503 --> 00:45:29,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the location, the liquor store, there's a bench there.

404
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:31,887
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people tend to hang there.

405
00:45:31,907 --> 00:45:34,089
[SPEAKER_01]: They go get whatever they get, come and sit.

406
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:41,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I see elderly, I see children, I see all kinds of people just trying to navigate away from that.

407
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,392
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a bad location.

408
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:47,315
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't be able to bring your kids in front of a liquor store to get on a bus.

409
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:49,096
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be moved permanently.

410
00:45:49,737 --> 00:45:58,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with definitely temporary, and I appreciate that first step, but I would like you also to consider talking to the MBTA about moving it permanently.

411
00:45:59,645 --> 00:45:59,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

412
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Would anyone else like to speak on this matter?

413
00:46:08,453 --> 00:46:10,175
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all shy now, the business owners.

414
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:11,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

415
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:13,017
[SPEAKER_04]: You did such a good job, Councilor.

416
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:13,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

417
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:23,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I certainly support this paper wholeheartedly, and I also think that in light of the fact that the majority of these business owners in West Medford do purchase

418
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:35,774
[SPEAKER_09]: business permits, and this is the business permit lot, that there should be a pro-ratio abatement to the business permit holder for the period of time equivalent to the amount of days that the lot is closed.

419
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:51,260
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to include that as part of the paper, that the Traffic Commission provide a pro-ratio abatement to the cost of a business permit in the equivalent of the number of days that the individuals that are in possession of the business permit

420
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:54,172
[SPEAKER_09]: are unable to access the lot.

421
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:55,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

422
00:46:55,293 --> 00:46:57,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Name and address of the wreckage.

423
00:46:57,855 --> 00:46:59,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Steven Pompeo, 18 Newton Road, Medford.

424
00:47:00,437 --> 00:47:02,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to Councilor Marks for bringing this up.

425
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:11,226
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be very helpful during this process where they're taking away the 35 parking spots in the parking lot for that period of 30 days.

426
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:17,091
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll also give an opportunity to test out that spot temporarily to see if it is potentially

427
00:47:17,842 --> 00:47:25,191
[SPEAKER_00]: a long-term solution for moving that bus stop, but at least temporarily for the short term, I'd like the council to support that motion.

428
00:47:26,252 --> 00:47:35,403
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a project I've been involved in since 2009 when it became a problem, and I know a lot of the business owners can't be here tonight because most of them in West Medford are still open and working.

429
00:47:36,003 --> 00:47:56,756
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the meeting that Councillor Marks spoke about and at other meetings we've had the consensus has generally been that moving that bus stop would Temporarily would be great to providing more spots right in the heart during this process There's been a number of other Suggestions made to do to help with this situation as well one of them

430
00:47:58,615 --> 00:48:12,827
[SPEAKER_00]: would be to step up the enforcement of High Street during this rather than, there's been some suggestions to, and they're in good faith, to eliminate paid parking during this process.

431
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:23,176
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that discussion comes up, I'd just like to say that most of the businesses in West Medford would prefer to have the enforcement stepped up during this process because the businesses want to leave High Street itself

432
00:48:23,836 --> 00:48:29,339
[SPEAKER_00]: for the customers and try to find alternative places for the business owners.

433
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,861
[SPEAKER_00]: The tip of Placetet Park was one that's going to come up in front of the Park Commission.

434
00:48:35,102 --> 00:48:37,203
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great suggestion on where to put the business owners.

435
00:48:37,563 --> 00:48:44,447
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it does come up, we'd like to also have support to double the parking enforcement on High Street so that the traffic gets moved.

436
00:48:45,107 --> 00:48:45,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

437
00:48:45,788 --> 00:48:46,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

438
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,390
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address of the record.

439
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,722
[SPEAKER_20]: DJ dabbing go for 70 high street West Medford.

440
00:48:53,762 --> 00:49:19,158
[SPEAKER_20]: I own dabs lock Thank you for councillor marks for bringing this up and councillor night for your suggestion on that I brought this actually up to Park Medford back in January when we were initially talking about this I stood at this podium and asked why the work couldn't be done at night what they were going to do about parking and I asked when I was giving over my hundred dollars for the parking permit I said is there gonna be any kind of leeway given where they're gonna be shutting our lot down for probably a close to a quarter of the year

441
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:21,548
[SPEAKER_20]: So we should be getting a quarter of that money back.

442
00:49:22,088 --> 00:49:24,950
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, as business owners, you know, we already spend in taxes.

443
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,211
[SPEAKER_20]: We already spend for utilities.

444
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:34,496
[SPEAKER_20]: Now we have to spend for an unguaranteed parking spot, which now for upwards of 30 days, we're just going to be at our own mercy to try to hopefully get a spot on the street.

445
00:49:35,796 --> 00:49:38,738
[SPEAKER_20]: So, and then the other issue is the bus stop being moved.

446
00:49:39,238 --> 00:49:46,783
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a great thing, but I think it should be permanently over in front of the bank where it's more ADA and compliant accessible by wheelchairs, people on crutches.

447
00:49:47,331 --> 00:49:59,398
[SPEAKER_20]: where it's not so much in front of the liquor store, because the next project they're going to do after the parking lot is they're going to be putting curb bump outs there to narrow high street to increase pedestrian safety, traffic flow kind of thing.

448
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:14,693
[SPEAKER_20]: And when talking with the city engineer, I said, if you put the bump out where you're putting it, and the bus now has to go around it to get into the bus stop, now you're gonna have the buses back in, sticking onto High Street, thus causing more traffic jams than there already are on High Street during the rush hours.

449
00:50:15,193 --> 00:50:18,836
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think a permanent solution is permanently putting the bus down in front of Brookline Bank.

450
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:24,800
[SPEAKER_20]: They have their own small parking lot behind the bank for their customers, and I think it's a way to go.

451
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:26,267
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you.

452
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:26,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

453
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:32,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there is a proposal to maybe take some, uh, use some land down a place to the park, uh, which has been proposed also.

454
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:35,870
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

455
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,631
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

456
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:44,213
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, I think, uh, my colleague, uh, Michael Moxley bringing this forward and I appreciate all the business owners.

457
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:44,713
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that,

458
00:50:45,185 --> 00:51:01,519
[SPEAKER_22]: As the chairperson of transportation, I think that I wholeheartedly support the temporary movement, but call for a subcommittee meeting and request the powers to be from the T to make this a full-time change.

459
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:04,401
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll be looking for a meeting relatively soon.

460
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:06,803
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that we still haven't heard anything back about

461
00:51:07,406 --> 00:51:12,047
[SPEAKER_22]: The resolution we put in about the Main Street and High Street issues again this week.

462
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:17,308
[SPEAKER_22]: There were work trucks again in front of that location, that T-stop.

463
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:23,510
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, it left the buses out onto High Street and off the curb.

464
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:28,471
[SPEAKER_22]: So I know they told us last meeting pretty arrogantly that that doesn't happen.

465
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:29,671
[SPEAKER_22]: And no one's called them.

466
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,492
[SPEAKER_22]: But some people are calling me again.

467
00:51:31,852 --> 00:51:35,873
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that we need to move quickly.

468
00:51:36,565 --> 00:51:37,286
[SPEAKER_22]: on these issues.

469
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:48,693
[SPEAKER_22]: I know we've talked to the director of ADA and I know that we've heard some concerns, but there are other issues on the other side why people aren't speaking up.

470
00:51:48,753 --> 00:51:51,535
[SPEAKER_22]: So we need to enforce that.

471
00:51:51,675 --> 00:52:03,182
[SPEAKER_22]: And hopefully the clerk can reach out again to the department of transportation and the T to get a meeting as soon as possible.

472
00:52:03,222 --> 00:52:03,562
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

473
00:52:03,782 --> 00:52:04,082
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

474
00:52:04,102 --> 00:52:04,823
[SPEAKER_22]: Counsel Scott, Billy.

475
00:52:06,182 --> 00:52:06,782
[SPEAKER_22]: Also Falco.

476
00:52:07,143 --> 00:52:07,843
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

477
00:52:07,883 --> 00:52:10,204
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to thank council Marks for bringing this forward.

478
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:11,865
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a good common sense solution.

479
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:16,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, that, uh, makes sense for the business owners and for the community in general.

480
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:21,431
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I would definitely be in favor of moving the bus stop full time, especially the way from the liquor store.

481
00:52:22,092 --> 00:52:23,853
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, uh, I'm glad you brought that forward.

482
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:26,134
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also glad that the business owners came down tonight.

483
00:52:26,174 --> 00:52:27,415
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's important to hear from them.

484
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:32,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, they experienced this every day and, uh, it's good to get their opinions and it's nice that they came down.

485
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:33,919
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you for coming down tonight.

486
00:52:34,513 --> 00:52:36,775
[SPEAKER_19]: But I am in favor of this resolution, so thank you.

487
00:52:37,336 --> 00:52:37,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

488
00:52:38,316 --> 00:52:39,157
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilwoman Goldkern.

489
00:52:39,297 --> 00:52:40,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Caviello.

490
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:45,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we know how many parking spaces we'll be able to capture if we move the stop?

491
00:52:46,984 --> 00:52:47,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Four?

492
00:52:48,906 --> 00:52:54,410
[SPEAKER_18]: And with regards to Brookline Bank, are they in compliance?

493
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,331
[SPEAKER_18]: Are they okay with this?

494
00:52:55,471 --> 00:52:55,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we know?

495
00:52:55,852 --> 00:52:56,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we've done.

496
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:58,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone's talked to Brookline Bank yet.

497
00:52:58,274 --> 00:52:59,875
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have a parking lot on the rail.

498
00:52:59,895 --> 00:53:00,736
[SPEAKER_18]: They have a parking lot on the rail.

499
00:53:00,756 --> 00:53:01,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so they're not losing.

500
00:53:02,457 --> 00:53:03,257
[SPEAKER_18]: What are they losing?

501
00:53:03,357 --> 00:53:04,437
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not losing any spots.

502
00:53:04,497 --> 00:53:08,738
[SPEAKER_04]: If we know it's a city parking, how many spots will we lose?

503
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably two, maybe three.

504
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I know there's a mailbox there that might have to be moved.

505
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:15,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

506
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice president amongst the benefit is that we're picking up the spots more in the heart of the square where this is a little further out.

507
00:53:24,942 --> 00:53:26,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So it accommodates more business where it is.

508
00:53:26,742 --> 00:53:28,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, that's, that's what we're hoping to do.

509
00:53:28,983 --> 00:53:29,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually I agree.

510
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:30,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, uh,

511
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,012
[SPEAKER_03]: as my colleagues agree, we'd like to see it permanent.

512
00:53:33,552 --> 00:53:40,678
[SPEAKER_03]: And this may be a great way of just getting it in and then saying it's been working, it's successful, and let's stick with it.

513
00:53:40,698 --> 00:53:43,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I just want to thank the businesses for showing up tonight.

514
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:52,026
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's amazing when you sit down with business owners and people in the community what great suggestions you can get, Mr. President, and move forward with.

515
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to thank the business owners.

516
00:53:54,028 --> 00:53:54,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

517
00:53:54,909 --> 00:54:00,153
[SPEAKER_18]: And if I may, through the chair, with regards to everything that's been discussed tonight,

518
00:54:00,952 --> 00:54:03,393
[SPEAKER_18]: I hear there's a lot of proposals out there.

519
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:10,297
[SPEAKER_18]: I know this is starting fairly quickly, and there are a lot of concerns from the business owners down in West Medford.

520
00:54:10,737 --> 00:54:21,202
[SPEAKER_18]: So when will these proposals be more set in stone so that the business owners can comment and maybe make additional suggestions and recommendations to alleviate some concerns?

521
00:54:21,262 --> 00:54:24,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Because as a business owner, I would not want to be put out like this for 30 days, 40 days.

522
00:54:27,293 --> 00:54:41,882
[SPEAKER_18]: So just through the chair, if I could recommend that the mayor's office work with the business owners, maybe whether that be another meeting once their proposals are, you know, kind of set in stone so that we can make sure everybody's happy and we can do whatever we can for the business owners.

523
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:50,267
[SPEAKER_18]: This is just one step in the many that probably need to be done in the next couple months, but whatever we have to do, we want to make sure that the doors stay open and moving.

524
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:51,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

525
00:54:52,168 --> 00:54:52,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

526
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:54,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

527
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:57,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering if maybe someone in the business community can answer this question for me.

528
00:54:57,442 --> 00:55:04,064
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also have a bus stop on the corner of Warren coming, I guess that would be West, into West Medford.

529
00:55:04,565 --> 00:55:07,666
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a bus stop at the corner of Placedead Road at Irving Street.

530
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:18,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Have those also been looked at as potential bus stops to move further away from the square to create some more parking on the opposite side of the street?

531
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,670
[SPEAKER_04]: The only other, there's a spot on Warren and High.

532
00:55:22,576 --> 00:55:24,479
[SPEAKER_09]: The bus stop right in front of the spa.

533
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:25,981
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only other spot.

534
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:29,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's a bus stop on the corner of Irving Street in place of the road.

535
00:55:29,265 --> 00:55:31,068
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's got to stay there.

536
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:32,129
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nowhere else to go over there.

537
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:33,291
[SPEAKER_09]: And even if they move it.

538
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:34,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowhere to move there.

539
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:38,438
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the proposal was to talk to the park commission and

540
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:43,318
[SPEAKER_04]: take that small section of Placid Park where they... Well, I'm aware what the proposal is.

541
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:45,960
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is whether or not those locations have been examined.

542
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:55,526
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully that'll be an area... If I can amend the paper to request that those two locations be examined, the corner of High Street and Warren Street and the corner of Placid Road and Irving Street.

543
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:56,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

544
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:03,512
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Vice President Marx, seconded by Councilor

545
00:56:05,813 --> 00:56:06,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Scott Pelley.

546
00:56:07,713 --> 00:56:09,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

547
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:13,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Immediately be sent to the MBTA.

548
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:16,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Immediately be sent to the MBTA.

549
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:31,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Dela Rucho.

550
00:56:32,018 --> 00:56:32,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

551
00:56:32,938 --> 00:56:33,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falcone.

552
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:34,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

553
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:35,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Nye?

554
00:56:35,268 --> 00:56:35,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

555
00:56:35,889 --> 00:56:36,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor McCurry?

556
00:56:36,669 --> 00:56:36,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

557
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Marks?

558
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:39,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

559
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:40,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scott Kelly?

560
00:56:40,412 --> 00:56:40,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

561
00:56:41,352 --> 00:56:42,133
[SPEAKER_10]: President Caviello?

562
00:56:42,613 --> 00:56:42,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

563
00:56:43,594 --> 00:56:46,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

564
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:49,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

565
00:56:49,618 --> 00:56:52,119
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-408, offered by Vice President Marks.

566
00:56:52,960 --> 00:57:02,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that Mitchell Avenue be resurfaced in the interest of public safety and that all potholes and road depressions be repaired

567
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:04,842
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, Vice President Marks.

568
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:06,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

569
00:57:06,664 --> 00:57:16,931
[SPEAKER_03]: There's portions of Mitchell Ave that you can actually see the dirt pavement, and it's about time the city moves forward on repaving Mitchell Ave.

570
00:57:17,632 --> 00:57:25,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to bring up on Salem Street, which I've brought up in the past, you can see the old railroad tracks coming through the road.

571
00:57:25,578 --> 00:57:32,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And on Riverside Ave, the same thing, not too far from the fire station on Riverside Ave, you can see the old railroad tracks

572
00:57:33,163 --> 00:57:34,704
[SPEAKER_03]: appearing through the road, Mr. President.

573
00:57:35,044 --> 00:57:45,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd ask that Mitchell Ave be resurfaced in the interest of public safety, and that Salem Street and Riverside Ave be looked at for the railroad tracks that need to be covered up.

574
00:57:46,247 --> 00:57:46,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

575
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:48,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Nice.

576
00:57:49,068 --> 00:57:50,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, this is a great resolution.

577
00:57:50,729 --> 00:57:54,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Mitchell Ave's been in rough shape since Testis was opened.

578
00:57:54,790 --> 00:58:00,092
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been long overdue that the street needs to be repaved, piggybacking on some of Councilor Mack's concerns.

579
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:18,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Between route 16 at Winthrop street and south street, um, due to the detour that's in place with the closure of the credit bridge, we're seeing a increased volume and cars that are being detoured down to, um, the Winthrop street and south street, Winthrop to high and Winthrop to self.

580
00:58:18,893 --> 00:58:23,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and in front of the baseball park, we're seeing the field fall apart, the street fall apart as well.

581
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:26,374
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're seeing the exposed red rip rock like we're seeing on Evan street.

582
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:29,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and we know that that's not something that we can just patch.

583
00:58:30,483 --> 00:58:40,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is something that may require a little bit of help from our friends at the state delegation in relation to the Craddock Bridge project and the request that we made last week for mitigation, Mr. President.

584
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:58,289
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask that this matter be put on a B paper and request that we receive some help in repaving and resurfacing the roadway between Route 16 and South Street as a result of the increased traffic volume on the roadway due to the detour that's in place because of the ramp closure.

585
00:58:58,889 --> 00:58:59,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

586
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,045
[SPEAKER_22]: Councillor Scarpelli.

587
00:59:02,966 --> 00:59:04,386
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

588
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:09,748
[SPEAKER_22]: If we could just ask for an update on the Evans and Parris Street.

589
00:59:10,409 --> 00:59:14,430
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that was been mentioned, just an update on those locations too.

590
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,551
[SPEAKER_22]: We can update on Evans and Parris Street.

591
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:18,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Member Kern.

592
00:59:20,253 --> 00:59:21,593
[SPEAKER_18]: Through the chair, thank you.

593
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:26,555
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could also, while we're at it, I know this is a good time if we're going to talk about streets.

594
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,776
[SPEAKER_18]: South Street's been brought up.

595
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:30,837
[SPEAKER_18]: We did, I believe, talk about

596
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:44,986
[SPEAKER_18]: traffic calming approaches on that, getting a lot of Mack trucks driving down South, especially since they're deterred from driving down Harvard now, and they're banging potholes, shaking homes, keeping people up at night.

597
00:59:45,506 --> 00:59:59,973
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got multiple complaints on the speed on South Street, so we did discuss this months ago with regards to working to curve the speeding somehow, whether it be the speed monitoring signs, speed bumps, something needs to be done on South Street because

598
01:00:00,781 --> 01:00:04,945
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really disrupting peace and enjoyment of the residents there.

599
01:00:05,025 --> 01:00:06,867
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we could add this to the agenda as well.

600
01:00:07,648 --> 01:00:08,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councillor Locker.

601
01:00:09,049 --> 01:00:21,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I could add something to that paper, if we could ask why the raised crosswalk on Boston Avenue where Tufts was doing construction was taken down by the city of Medford.

602
01:00:22,883 --> 01:00:23,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Knight.

603
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:40,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President, I actually had a conversation with Commissioner Kerins before the Committee of the Whole today, and he informed me that Paris Street would be going underneath, I'm sorry, Evans Street, not Paris Street, would have the ground broken in the next two weeks for that project to start up.

604
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:44,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm looking forward to seeing that happen to answer Councilor Scott Pelley's question.

605
01:00:44,368 --> 01:00:49,452
[SPEAKER_09]: And also on your question, I spoke with Rocco DiRico from- I spoke with Rocco myself today.

606
01:00:50,201 --> 01:00:54,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Tufts University relative to the speed bump and that was a temporary speed bump that was put up during the construction.

607
01:00:54,864 --> 01:01:01,067
[SPEAKER_09]: The construction is nearing an end so they've taken the temporary speed bump down and they're going to move forward with striping and safety markers and so on.

608
01:01:02,288 --> 01:01:06,951
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always fighting for raised crosswalks and we had one there that they put in for free and we took it away.

609
01:01:10,092 --> 01:01:19,338
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Scott Pelli, Councilor Kerrio-Viello, Councilor Lococoon,

610
01:01:20,393 --> 01:01:21,214

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Haynes.

612
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:32,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor De La Russo.

613
01:01:32,803 --> 01:01:34,204

[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

617
01:01:42,191 --> 01:01:42,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

618
01:01:42,952 --> 01:01:43,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Naye.

619
01:01:43,512 --> 01:01:43,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

620
01:01:44,273 --> 01:01:45,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Curran.

621
01:01:45,274 --> 01:01:45,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

622
01:01:45,874 --> 01:01:46,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Marks.

623
01:01:47,035 --> 01:01:47,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

624
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:48,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

625
01:01:48,816 --> 01:01:48,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

626
01:01:50,714 --> 01:01:53,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 17 in the affirmative and then in the negative.

627
01:01:53,915 --> 01:01:55,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

628
01:01:56,015 --> 01:01:59,356
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-417 offered by Vice President Marks.

629
01:02:00,176 --> 01:02:09,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the proposed erection of cell phone towers at 63 Tyler Ave and 59 Charnwood Road be discussed.

630
01:02:10,499 --> 01:02:11,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Marks.

631
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:13,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

632
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

633
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:31,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I offer this resolution tonight, Mr. President, to hopefully go back and have the city solicitor look into a resolution that was offered by this council and debated back in 2011.

634
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:40,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I offer this resolution is, Mr. President, there's a proposal by a company called In Motion Wireless and Corp.

635
01:02:41,854 --> 01:02:44,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just actually put,

636
01:02:45,521 --> 01:02:48,782
[SPEAKER_03]: an announcement in the transcript recently.

637
01:02:48,822 --> 01:02:53,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It appeared in the April 20th edition of the transcript.

638
01:02:53,063 --> 01:03:02,386
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a legal notice, and the legal notice stated that they were going to erect two 70-foot cell phone towers, proposed.

639
01:03:03,187 --> 01:03:06,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I saw the addresses, I said, you gotta be kidding me.

640
01:03:07,308 --> 01:03:14,330
[SPEAKER_03]: The first address, Mr. President, was 63 Tyler Ave, which we all know is a residential area that abuts train tracks.

641
01:03:15,032 --> 01:03:22,274
[SPEAKER_03]: and also 59 Charnwood Road, which is another residential area that abuts train tracks, Mr. President.

642
01:03:23,054 --> 01:03:36,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Both towers would be located in smack dab in neighborhoods and, in my opinion, would create a major visual impact in the area.

643
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:44,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, currently in, uh, there was no city ordinance that governs the placement of cell phone towers.

644
01:03:44,624 --> 01:03:49,146
[SPEAKER_03]: The current ordinance only regulates TV and radio antennas.

645
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:51,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was back in 2008, believe it or not.

646
01:03:53,753 --> 01:04:03,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I offered a resolution, paper 08-510, that would put into our city ordinance cell phone towers.

647
01:04:04,502 --> 01:04:10,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it would do is it would prohibit cell phone towers in residential areas.

648
01:04:11,308 --> 01:04:17,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll talk about that a little bit later on, but that paper went through a lot of debate back and forth.

649
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,955
[SPEAKER_03]: National Grid spoke on the paper.

650
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:34,464
[SPEAKER_03]: The paper was sent to the office of community development, which all, um, um, ordinances need to be sent to dealing with, uh, zoning and, um, the paper trail kind of dies off after that.

651
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:47,670
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, the reason why I offer this tonight, Mr. President is as I stated, um, there is no, uh, ordinance right now that, um, that prohibits towers in residential areas.

652
01:04:48,507 --> 01:04:56,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a resolution to amend ordinances only allowing cell towers in industrial and commercial zones and also by special permit.

653
01:04:57,389 --> 01:04:59,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the matter was tabled by the council.

654
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:14,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, when a representative from national grid raised an issue that was, um, at least two, um, state statutes allow wireless communication companies to attach antennas and amplifiers on utility poles.

655
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:20,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time we were prohibiting, um, any, uh, cell towers, uh, within neighborhoods.

656
01:05:20,943 --> 01:05:31,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said that, uh, was in direct, um, conflict with state statute, which allows these utility companies to put them on top of telephone poles.

657
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:36,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Needless to say, this is not the request that was put in the transcript recently.

658
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:40,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm asking tonight, Mr. President, that, um,

659
01:05:42,695 --> 01:06:11,210
[SPEAKER_03]: This paper be looked at by the city solicitor, uh, Mark Rumley and the building commissioner and provide, uh, the input that the community development board already gave us and the input language that national grid gave us, uh, which came out with, I believe was a great city ordinance back in 2011, uh, that would address, uh, the issue of erecting telephone, um, cell phone towers in residential neighborhoods.

660
01:06:12,213 --> 01:06:24,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's my first motion that the city solicitor and the building commissioner look into the 2011 city ordinance draft that was proposed.

661
01:06:24,638 --> 01:06:40,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, Mr. President, the legal notice that was posted deals strictly with locating a cell tower near an historical preservation, national historic preservation.

662
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:57,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the acts of 1966 and the 2005 nationwide programmatic agreement, uh, that allows for public comment when you're putting a cell phone tower within a half mile of a historic, uh, preservation.

663
01:06:58,672 --> 01:07:02,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they're looking for input right now.

664
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:08,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would ask the city solicitor, uh, what legal, um,

665
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:27,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Maneuvers can be done to, first of all, look at the Royal House, which is probably within, I'd say, a half a mile or very close to Charnwood Road, to see if there's anything we can do on possibly putting a halt to this.

666
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:32,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, Mr. President, it's vital now that we act.

667
01:07:34,794 --> 01:07:39,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some people come to me and say, well, there's a lot of areas in the city where

668
01:07:40,178 --> 01:07:44,541
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, they're considered dead zones and you can't get a cell phone connections and so forth.

669
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that may not even be the case.

670
01:07:47,143 --> 01:07:49,284
[SPEAKER_03]: These may not even be phone cell towers.

671
01:07:49,704 --> 01:07:53,427
[SPEAKER_03]: They may be cell towers for use of, uh, the railways.

672
01:07:54,287 --> 01:08:08,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I don't have that information, but I know that a city solicitor Romley did reach out to the attorneys that were on the notice I received, uh, just tonight.

673
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:16,554
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, from the federal communication commission, Washington DC, it's called information notice of section one Oh six filings.

674
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:24,578
[SPEAKER_03]: They list both addresses and who the petitioner is, is for both in the consultant.

675
01:08:25,358 --> 01:08:28,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and I think, uh, solicitor Romley reached out.

676
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:35,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if he got a response, but I would ask at this time, if the city solicitor can get up, Mr. President, he was involved in 2011,

677
01:08:37,232 --> 01:08:39,874
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, crafting the language and working on this with the council.

678
01:08:40,595 --> 01:08:41,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I'd like to hear from him.

679
01:08:42,276 --> 01:08:42,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

680
01:08:42,616 --> 01:08:43,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

681
01:08:44,057 --> 01:08:44,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

682
01:08:44,297 --> 01:08:45,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

683
01:08:45,178 --> 01:08:46,399
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Mark Rumbley.

684
01:08:46,779 --> 01:08:50,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the city solicitor and I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

685
01:08:51,363 --> 01:08:54,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a lot of different things going on with this particular issue.

686
01:08:55,386 --> 01:09:05,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we start and put to the side just for a second, although I appreciate it, the ordinance that was proposed a few years back that really should be revived because procedurally

687
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:27,012
[SPEAKER_02]: it did reach some type of a death procedurally years ago for different reasons, none of which really are easy to ascertain, but nonetheless it should be revived and it should be revived because it was a good idea that it's a good idea now, even if these notices didn't come forward right now, dealing with, uh, uh, Charnwood and Tyler.

688
01:09:27,572 --> 01:09:27,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Now,

689
01:09:28,553 --> 01:09:32,816
[SPEAKER_02]: to go according to what I've come across in the last few days.

690
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:39,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I received from the city clerk two very vanilla notices under 106.

691
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really didn't know what they were.

692
01:09:41,981 --> 01:09:49,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did say Tyler and it did say something about cell phone towers and that sort of thing.

693
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:51,987
[SPEAKER_02]: After I received it and almost concurrently with

694
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Mox called me and said, do you know anything about it?

695
01:09:55,084 --> 01:09:58,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I didn't know anything more than those two simple notices.

696
01:09:59,465 --> 01:10:03,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I called the consultant who are in Wisconsin this morning.

697
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:04,627
[SPEAKER_02]: They called me back this afternoon.

698
01:10:05,487 --> 01:10:18,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And this notification under chapter, under 106, which is a federal regulation, begins a comment period during which time a municipality, in this case, could comment on this particular proposal.

699
01:10:19,071 --> 01:10:21,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is, as Councilor Mox had stated,

700
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,628
[SPEAKER_02]: to put up these two towers at this particular address.

701
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:35,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the consultants were hired, of course, and they were hired by the entity that's serving the MTA, MBTA, excuse me, for these two towers.

702
01:10:35,176 --> 01:10:40,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Because ostensibly, the use of the towers would be to serve the ridership on the trains.

703
01:10:40,539 --> 01:10:45,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not simply be a cell tower like servicing our cell phones.

704
01:10:45,463 --> 01:10:49,546
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be to provide Wi-Fi services to the people on the train.

705
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is for the MBTA that this was planned.

706
01:10:55,542 --> 01:11:01,146
[SPEAKER_02]: So the person on the other end was very informative, a very professional gentleman named Andrew Rice.

707
01:11:01,946 --> 01:11:05,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, is this going to service the MBTA only?

708
01:11:05,188 --> 01:11:06,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wanted to know that.

709
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, well, yes, of course.

710
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:11,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, over the years, we all learned a little bit about cell towers.

711
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:23,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And a cell tower is not necessarily just for the one use, which is on that tower, because there's a whole industry, a billion dollar industry in cell towers, where the spots on that tower are sold.

712
01:11:24,412 --> 01:11:33,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked Mr. Rice today, is it the intention of the MBTA to sell any other spaces on this tower, on these towers, if they build them for commercial use?

713
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:41,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that I asked that is, Mr. Rice indicated, well, for many purposes, although he didn't enumerate the purposes,

714
01:11:42,136 --> 01:11:47,978
[SPEAKER_02]: For many purposes, the MBTA is exempt from local rule, and there's something to say about that.

715
01:11:48,139 --> 01:11:50,700
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some validity to that, depending upon the use.

716
01:11:51,480 --> 01:12:06,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said, if you're going to sell or you're going to rent out any of the spots on that tower, then you're not just simply using it for MBTA uses, you're using it for commercial uses, for a for-profit use, and that brings things out of many areas of exemption.

717
01:12:06,946 --> 01:12:10,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, that's the first time we talked about it, so there's a little bit of,

718
01:12:11,546 --> 01:12:13,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say silence for a few seconds after that.

719
01:12:13,648 --> 01:12:14,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just lifted at that.

720
01:12:15,269 --> 01:12:24,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the second thing is, when this notice went in the transcript, that began what under 106 is a 30-day comment period.

721
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:30,560
[SPEAKER_02]: A 30-day comment period for everyone to send in their sentiments, concerns, and questions.

722
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:41,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I believe that the direct communication to the city was sent to the city clerk, the historic commission, I believe, and also it said generically the city of Medford.

723
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:49,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can all say it was sent to the city of Medford, but you need to have a little bit of meat on the bones when you use that particular term.

724
01:12:49,745 --> 01:12:56,909
[SPEAKER_02]: So to make sure the city of Medford received it, I asked Mr. Rice to send me the full packet this afternoon, which he did by email.

725
01:12:57,269 --> 01:13:02,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And I flipped it out to nine or 10 department heads and I shared it with the council.

726
01:13:03,173 --> 01:13:04,693
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think you might've had it anyway.

727
01:13:04,733 --> 01:13:06,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know, but I wanted to make sure that you had it.

728
01:13:07,575 --> 01:13:08,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So where does that leave us?

729
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:17,322
[SPEAKER_02]: That leaves us, one, with an ordinance that probably needs a little bit of shaping and a little bit of polish for present day, which is a good idea anyway.

730
01:13:17,582 --> 01:13:18,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Should look at that.

731
01:13:18,883 --> 01:13:34,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, it puts us smack dab in the middle of a comment period where the city, its departments, its executive branch, and all other entities that have been notified should give their concern into the FCC under this notice.

732
01:13:35,915 --> 01:13:51,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Third, it puts us in the position of examining what the exact use would be by the MBTA and whether or not, if they do have any exemptions, whether or not those exemptions are waived or in any other way altered because of any intended commercial use of the cell tower.

733
01:13:52,768 --> 01:14:04,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, if the ordinance which was not passed a few years back is enacted in some way, shape, or form right now, then the question could be, and there is no definitive answer to this, what effect

734
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:08,211
[SPEAKER_02]: a newly passed ordinance would be on this particular project.

735
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:23,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the effective date or the notice date for the world, for the general public, so to speak, and you should always keep this in mind with a zoning enactment, is the date of publication before the planning board.

736
01:14:24,456 --> 01:14:32,038
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, about 20 years ago or 25 years ago, there was a moratorium put in place for certain uses in the city of Medford.

737
01:14:32,402 --> 01:14:35,664
[SPEAKER_02]: that became effective when it was advertised before the planning board.

738
01:14:36,204 --> 01:14:52,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this ordinance went forth and was advertised before the planning board, that may well have some effect on this particular project, but that also would beg some other questions, like what exactly will the MBTA be using this tower for outside of serving its ridership?

739
01:14:53,195 --> 01:15:00,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds like a lot, but everything has to be broken down to its simplest elements, and we have to begin at the beginning.

740
01:15:00,808 --> 01:15:14,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first domino to fall, and there are two concurrently, would be for the council to revive a look at that older ordinance that was proposed because procedurally it's not alive.

741
01:15:14,856 --> 01:15:26,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondly, for all of the entities in the city of Medford, the various departments, et cetera, to craft carefully their concerns and to submit them under this notice period.

742
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:30,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And the very last thing I'd say before I yield to my good friend,

743
01:15:31,267 --> 01:15:51,541
[SPEAKER_02]: is that the purpose of this notice period is under the NEPA to make certain determinations as to historical uses in the area, which is why the Royal House is a pertinent, in its distance away from this particular proposed cell tower, is pertinent.

744
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And that comes up under the National Environmental Policy Act.

745
01:15:56,564 --> 01:15:59,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are the various elements of this matter.

746
01:15:59,839 --> 01:16:02,280
[SPEAKER_02]: and the various nuances that were presented with.

747
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:07,623
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

748
01:16:07,643 --> 01:16:08,624
[SPEAKER_23]: Name and address of the record, please.

749
01:16:09,204 --> 01:16:09,905
[SPEAKER_23]: Tom Lincoln.

750
01:16:09,925 --> 01:16:14,027
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm an executive director of the Royal House and Slave Quarters at 15 George Street.

751
01:16:14,067 --> 01:16:17,689
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 27 Gleason Street in Medford.

752
01:16:18,309 --> 01:16:24,813
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like to thank Councillor Marks and also the city solicitor and Ken Kraus, who actually brought this in front of

753
01:16:25,644 --> 01:16:26,886
[SPEAKER_23]: some of us in the community.

754
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:31,812
[SPEAKER_23]: The Royal House and Slave Quarters, as we can best figure it, is about 2,000 feet away.

755
01:16:32,753 --> 01:16:42,705
[SPEAKER_23]: One thing that I think needs clarification, as I understand it, is that these are legal addresses, but the cell phone towers are actually proposed on the railroad right away.

756
01:16:42,725 --> 01:16:45,008
[SPEAKER_23]: I think you probably have to give the closest

757
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:46,968
[SPEAKER_23]: street address to there.

758
01:16:47,668 --> 01:16:57,893
[SPEAKER_23]: But that said, the Royal House and Slave Quarters is a National Historic Landmark, which is the highest category of historic sites right here in Medford.

759
01:16:58,153 --> 01:17:00,515
[SPEAKER_23]: We certainly preceded these cell phones by about 287 years.

760
01:17:04,461 --> 01:17:12,244
[SPEAKER_23]: And we're concerned, as I've talked to some of my colleagues and people on the board at the Royal House and Slave Quarters, about the visual impact.

761
01:17:13,024 --> 01:17:21,947
[SPEAKER_23]: 74 feet, I'm not an expert on visual impacts, but 74 feet is 65, 75, 74 feet, whatever it is, is pretty high.

762
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:24,608
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's higher than any building in the neighborhood.

763
01:17:24,648 --> 01:17:31,110
[SPEAKER_23]: It's certainly higher than our, than the 1737 house that we have, as well as the Slave Quarters.

764
01:17:33,133 --> 01:17:40,095
[SPEAKER_23]: It's also not clear, and I think it will be good to know, exactly what the consequences are of commenting.

765
01:17:40,195 --> 01:17:51,039
[SPEAKER_23]: If it's just a comment period just to gather information, and if you don't have any statutory rights, et cetera, I'm not sure how much good that would do.

766
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:56,281
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're certainly, at the Royal House of Slave Quarters, are concerned about this.

767
01:17:56,601 --> 01:18:02,223
[SPEAKER_23]: We're certainly going to comment, along with the city departments,

768
01:18:03,032 --> 01:18:14,480
[SPEAKER_23]: One thing, if you haven't been on a tour at the Royal House Slave Quarters recently, one thing we try to convey with our one acre left of 500 historic acres is the extent of the property.

769
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:20,525
[SPEAKER_23]: And so we do talk about the surrounding landscape and people certainly get a view of the neighborhood.

770
01:18:20,685 --> 01:18:31,913
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm trying to imagine what it might look like with the cell phone tower sticking up above every other house off of George Street and back in that adjacent neighborhood.

771
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:49,444
[SPEAKER_23]: The second place, which I wear several hats here, but the second place which may be affected, though I think visually may be not affected, is the Brooks Estate, which I believe is about a half a mile from the Tyler Avenue location.

772
01:18:49,464 --> 01:18:51,265
[SPEAKER_23]: 63, is it 63 Tyler?

773
01:18:52,925 --> 01:18:59,467
[SPEAKER_23]: Is very close to Grove Street, up on the north end of Tyler there.

774
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:10,533
[SPEAKER_23]: The last point I would make, and I think this is certainly in the back of people's minds, if there are two towers being proposed today, what's in the future here?

775
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:27,427
[SPEAKER_23]: There are clearly some interesting and perhaps difficult jurisdictional issues in terms of the MBTA, et cetera, but the demand for bandwidth, as I understand it, the demand for services is certainly not going down.

776
01:19:30,897 --> 01:19:33,719
[SPEAKER_23]: Going back to the cell phone side, there are certainly dead spots.

777
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:39,424
[SPEAKER_23]: In fact, the royal house, if you're inside the royal house, it's very hard to get cell phone service for some reason.

778
01:19:40,925 --> 01:19:46,469
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that precedent is a thing to worry about here in terms of.

779
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:52,454
[SPEAKER_23]: And these are really, any way you look at it, these are really tall structures.

780
01:19:54,236 --> 01:19:56,378
[SPEAKER_23]: In the past, in fact, this has happened in West Bedford,

781
01:19:57,611 --> 01:20:00,752
[SPEAKER_23]: cell phone transmitters, or whatever they are, or amplifiers, I guess.

782
01:20:01,573 --> 01:20:04,014
[SPEAKER_23]: Cell phone service have been placed atop buildings.

783
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:05,134
[SPEAKER_23]: They've been disguised.

784
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,256
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no disguising these towers.

785
01:20:08,656 --> 01:20:12,757
[SPEAKER_23]: So we look forward to learning more about this.

786
01:20:12,957 --> 01:20:19,480
[SPEAKER_23]: And we look forward both to an effective ordinance and to a resolution of some of these issues.

787
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:19,900
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

788
01:20:23,802 --> 01:20:24,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

789
01:20:25,303 --> 01:20:26,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address of the record.

790
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:30,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue in West Medford.

791
01:20:30,863 --> 01:20:33,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I, like Mr. Lincoln, I wear several hats here.

792
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:35,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on the Medford Historic Commission.

793
01:20:36,507 --> 01:20:51,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a director of the Brooks City Land Trust, and I've also served as the former chair of the Green Line Extension Design Working Group, which is currently dormant, but this is affected by the Green Line because of the property on Charnwood, which is directly abuts the

794
01:20:52,605 --> 01:20:54,606
[SPEAKER_08]: future Green Line extension to Tufts.

795
01:20:55,466 --> 01:20:56,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to echo what was said before.

796
01:20:56,827 --> 01:21:02,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a, these are insanely large, very disruptive visually.

797
01:21:02,729 --> 01:21:05,931
[SPEAKER_08]: They lower property values, frankly, for anyone within sight of them.

798
01:21:06,131 --> 01:21:10,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly the backyards of the people along Charnwood are not going to be enhanced by them.

799
01:21:11,773 --> 01:21:18,876
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Memphis Historic Commission, we have reviewed at least a half a dozen soap tower proposals in the last few years.

800
01:21:19,737 --> 01:21:20,337
[SPEAKER_08]: They've all been

801
01:21:21,587 --> 01:21:22,207
[SPEAKER_08]: penthouses.

802
01:21:22,308 --> 01:21:26,410
[SPEAKER_08]: They've all been on the sides of buildings, buried amongst mechanical equipment.

803
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:32,453
[SPEAKER_08]: They've never been freestanding because it's insane to even propose that in a dense city like the city of Medford.

804
01:21:32,473 --> 01:21:33,293
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too disruptive.

805
01:21:33,914 --> 01:21:45,840
[SPEAKER_08]: We've approved them because, well, we didn't actually approve them, but we commented on them, and we sometimes were able to guide them on things like paint colors or maybe shifting their location to be less visually intrusive, but we

806
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:49,834
[SPEAKER_08]: They've always been rather intelligently proposed, and these are not.

807
01:21:50,234 --> 01:21:56,817
[SPEAKER_08]: These are obviously in smack dab in the navel of the West Medford and the Hillside neighborhoods, and they're going to cause immeasurable damage.

808
01:21:57,598 --> 01:22:04,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are plenty of buildings that are about 70 feet tall, all along the railway, not far from these locations.

809
01:22:05,182 --> 01:22:09,364
[SPEAKER_08]: We just need to push them a little bit to come up with a better design rather than the plain, simple drop.

810
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:13,626
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 75 feet to the top of equipment is what the drawings say that we all received today.

811
01:22:15,705 --> 01:22:17,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically go back to the drawing board and try again.

812
01:22:17,867 --> 01:22:18,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Try a better way to do it.

813
01:22:19,509 --> 01:22:21,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Think of the Cummings building on Boston Ave.

814
01:22:21,271 --> 01:22:22,092
[SPEAKER_08]: The U-Haul building.

815
01:22:22,492 --> 01:22:26,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Think of several buildings along Tufts not too far from Charnwood.

816
01:22:26,696 --> 01:22:31,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are perfectly logical places we could put these towers and nobody would ever see them.

817
01:22:31,882 --> 01:22:37,628
[SPEAKER_08]: We just need to work better and start a dialogue but tell them this is simply unacceptable.

818
01:22:38,205 --> 01:22:42,428
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the Grove Street slave wall is probably within 700 feet of the one in Playstead.

819
01:22:43,028 --> 01:22:45,509
[SPEAKER_08]: This will be looming over the ball fields on Playstead.

820
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:50,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the royal house is within, I know the Brooks Estate, at least a portion with the ponds is within that half mile.

821
01:22:50,533 --> 01:23:01,239
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's clearly some historic resources that the documents say there's no negative effect on in the 33-page document you all received today, which is simply not true.

822
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:03,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just need to basically pause

823
01:23:04,851 --> 01:23:05,972
[SPEAKER_08]: and come up with a better solution.

824
01:23:06,012 --> 01:23:07,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm convinced there is a good one here.

825
01:23:07,632 --> 01:23:09,373
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need to reinvent the wheel.

826
01:23:09,873 --> 01:23:11,614
[SPEAKER_08]: They should not be putting these in residential neighborhoods.

827
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:13,015
[SPEAKER_08]: We do need to revise our zoning.

828
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:14,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely agree with the council on that.

829
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:18,998
[SPEAKER_08]: And I look forward to helping that make, make that occur in the very near future.

830
01:23:19,158 --> 01:23:19,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

831
01:23:19,918 --> 01:23:22,880
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. Councilor Scott Pelley.

832
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:25,381
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

833
01:23:25,941 --> 01:23:33,805
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that back in the day when this resolution that council marks talking about was directly involved in the field of dreams committee and

834
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:42,430
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the biggest issues we had was that cell phone tower and the operation being built behind the high school.

835
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:52,312
[SPEAKER_22]: And one of the biggest benefits for that American cell phone tower company at the time was how quickly and how much money they would make off of selling parts of that tower.

836
01:23:52,332 --> 01:24:00,494
[SPEAKER_22]: What would be interesting to me is to see where else on the line that the T would be looking to put other towers.

837
01:24:00,794 --> 01:24:02,414
[SPEAKER_22]: Because if you can, I think that

838
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:03,992
[SPEAKER_22]: would be a direct correlation.

839
01:24:04,032 --> 01:24:19,035
[SPEAKER_22]: If you see it just, you know, not just Medford, but you see it down the line, I think it might help us in really understanding that they're using, I mean, let's all, you know, state the facts, the T's in huge financial difficulties.

840
01:24:19,515 --> 01:24:28,217
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd like to see that maybe if there's a way to ask them in our conversations, are we just looking in Medford or are they looking all the way down the line?

841
01:24:28,237 --> 01:24:30,517
[SPEAKER_22]: Because if I think they, if they are doing that,

842
01:24:31,501 --> 01:24:42,688
[SPEAKER_22]: I think this would be just a clear punch in the face that shows that they're using this for a revenue stream rather than what might be just discussed.

843
01:24:42,728 --> 01:24:49,292
[SPEAKER_22]: So that'd be interesting to see if we can reach out and ask that question.

844
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:52,535
[SPEAKER_22]: If it's just Medford, are they putting those towers elsewhere?

845
01:24:52,995 --> 01:24:55,857
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be an interesting information.

846
01:24:55,877 --> 01:24:56,357
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

847
01:24:56,537 --> 01:24:58,238
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Scott.

848
01:24:58,338 --> 01:24:58,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Max.

849
01:24:59,559 --> 01:25:00,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

850
01:25:01,755 --> 01:25:11,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if I could, in addition to what was mentioned about the legal notice, uh, regarding, uh, the public input, uh, on a national registered or historic places.

851
01:25:12,001 --> 01:25:26,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I did speak to Paul Moki, the building commissioner, and he stated that the only requirement that he is aware of as building commissioner, if someone wants to erect a cell phone tower, it's a building permit and an electrical permit.

852
01:25:27,391 --> 01:25:29,212
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no others, no special permit.

853
01:25:29,943 --> 01:25:32,424
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no other hoops that you have to jump through.

854
01:25:33,204 --> 01:25:40,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And there may be a question regarding zoning setbacks, and that's something that's being looked at currently right now.

855
01:25:40,866 --> 01:25:57,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that the original paper, 11-477, be sent to Solicitor Rumley, and that is the paper that includes

856
01:25:58,134 --> 01:26:11,243
[SPEAKER_03]: The recommendations from the community development board, which recommended that wireless towers only be constructed in the two most industrial zoning districts in the city.

857
01:26:11,923 --> 01:26:19,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And that also the board recommended the city council be the granting authority for special permits for towers in those zones.

858
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were the two recommendations that came out.

859
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:26,473
[SPEAKER_03]: National grid also to be in compliance with the two state statutes.

860
01:26:26,997 --> 01:26:33,518
[SPEAKER_03]: a recommended language that would still allow them to put cell towers on their telephone poles.

861
01:26:33,578 --> 01:26:38,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And I won't speak for the city solicitor, but I think that's something that we're obligated to do.

862
01:26:38,959 --> 01:26:41,639
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to adhere to whatever state statute is.

863
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:49,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And this paper, Mr. President, I believe addresses all those concerns and it's a combination of all that input.

864
01:26:49,641 --> 01:26:54,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also ask that my paper be referred to the committee of the whole.

865
01:26:55,342 --> 01:26:55,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So paper 17 dash

866
01:26:57,575 --> 01:26:59,697
[SPEAKER_03]: 417 be referred to the Committee of the Whole.

867
01:27:00,197 --> 01:27:26,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we get a response back from the city solicitor on paper 11-477 on the language, we can meet in the Committee of the Whole and hopefully we can push this ordinance through after three readings, Mr. President, and give the neighborhood the safeguards and the peace of mind that they deserve that these towers won't be popping up, Mr. President, in places that they're not welcomed.

868
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:27,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Mr. Vice Presidents.

869
01:27:28,254 --> 01:27:28,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Counselor Knight.

870
01:27:29,515 --> 01:27:35,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I feel as though the course of action that Councilor Marks just laid out makes perfect sense and I would second the motion.

871
01:27:35,796 --> 01:27:36,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval.

872
01:27:37,636 --> 01:27:40,677
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

873
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:42,977
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

874
01:27:43,418 --> 01:27:43,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

875
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:46,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

876
01:27:47,838 --> 01:27:51,859
[SPEAKER_04]: We will do our best to get a Council of the Whole within the next two weeks.

877
01:27:52,019 --> 01:27:54,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing that our Council of the Whole is a little on the full side right now and

878
01:27:55,263 --> 01:27:56,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we can get it in before budget season.

879
01:27:59,084 --> 01:28:01,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm sure the city solicitor will work diligently on it.

880
01:28:01,966 --> 01:28:02,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct?

881
01:28:02,866 --> 01:28:06,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

882
01:28:06,067 --> 01:28:08,988
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-409 offered by Councilor Falco.

883
01:28:10,009 --> 01:28:23,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the Memphis City Council will soon be reviewing the proposed city budget, be it resolved that the city administration send summarized CCLIX fixed data to the Memphis City Council

884
01:28:24,505 --> 01:28:27,826
[SPEAKER_04]: to help aid budget decision making.

885
01:28:29,426 --> 01:28:30,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

886
01:28:31,366 --> 01:28:32,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

887
01:28:32,706 --> 01:28:39,027
[SPEAKER_19]: As we all know, budget season is upon us and we will be meeting hopefully sooner than later with regard to the city budget.

888
01:28:39,668 --> 01:28:49,369
[SPEAKER_19]: But I know during the budget deliberations, there's always plenty of questions as to what the different departments do and whatnot and what's being accomplished.

889
01:28:49,809 --> 01:28:53,750
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to be proactive here and see if we could get a report.

890
01:28:54,507 --> 01:28:58,888
[SPEAKER_19]: see click fix report with regard to the items that are being reported.

891
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:10,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, you know, so I guess the issues that are being reported, the data being reported, uh, the department that the issue is being assigned to in the duration that it's taking for these issues to get fixed.

892
01:29:11,392 --> 01:29:19,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I think it would be good to actually had that information when we go into a budget deliberations, um, you know, data driven decision making, I don't think it's a bad thing.

893
01:29:19,874 --> 01:29:21,655
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's good to actually had that information.

894
01:29:22,197 --> 01:29:36,587
[SPEAKER_19]: when we're negotiating the budget, I think it would benefit all of us to get a true picture as to, you know, what different departments are doing on a daily basis and to see what, you know, different problems are occurring throughout the city and, you know, how long it's taking to get these fixed.

895
01:29:37,328 --> 01:29:41,491
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would ask for some support and move approval.

896
01:29:42,131 --> 01:29:42,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

897
01:29:43,292 --> 01:29:43,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

898
01:29:44,033 --> 01:29:44,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Councillor Knight.

899
01:29:45,503 --> 01:29:58,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, this is a great resolution, and I don't think anybody behind this rail is going to vote against it, especially based on the fact that when C-Click Fix was rolled out, we've asked for quarterly reports, and those quarterly reports were not forthcoming.

900
01:29:59,632 --> 01:30:01,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank Councilor Falco for putting this resolution on.

901
01:30:01,994 --> 01:30:08,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I also thank him for his foresight in starting to think about the budget at this early time, not really early, but earlier than usual.

902
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:14,602
[SPEAKER_09]: So I certainly wholeheartedly support this request, Mr. President, and I would like to add a B paper.

903
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:29,136
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, requesting that the council reiterate its request to receive quarterly reports from see click fix on the motion by counselor Falco seconded by counselor Della Russo as amended by counselor night.

904
01:30:30,297 --> 01:30:31,077
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

905
01:30:32,578 --> 01:30:39,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes 17 four one zero offered by counselor Scott Pelley.

906
01:30:40,404 --> 01:30:44,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the city council discuss signage

907
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:46,839
[SPEAKER_04]: located on public lands.

908
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Scarpelli.

909
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,460
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

910
01:30:52,381 --> 01:31:14,586
[SPEAKER_22]: This is multifaceted, but I think that a few of the concerns that I'd like to address that we like answered from the Department of Public Works is looking at our ordinances and what we're asking our constituents to follow at our local ball fields and looking at the signs that are there now and making sure they're

911
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:22,595
[SPEAKER_22]: They're updated and the graffiti is removed from some of them or replaced if we can.

912
01:31:23,155 --> 01:31:33,743
[SPEAKER_22]: And second that we look at, I've had a few phone calls that the private entities are using public land to advertise.

913
01:31:35,043 --> 01:31:43,189
[SPEAKER_22]: One constituent called and mentioned that there was a painting company that was putting their signage in front of their

914
01:31:43,734 --> 01:31:45,034
[SPEAKER_22]: public land in front of their home.

915
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:48,636
[SPEAKER_22]: And they thought the question was, is the city approving that?

916
01:31:48,676 --> 01:31:49,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that something that I have to keep there?

917
01:31:50,476 --> 01:31:56,558
[SPEAKER_22]: So, um, I'd like to get, uh, you know, what, if we can look into what department can answer that for us.

918
01:31:57,078 --> 01:32:01,560
[SPEAKER_22]: And if there is no such, I think we can go to the code enforcement officer.

919
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:10,723
[SPEAKER_22]: We can look at the code enforcement officer and ask that, that they then remove all the signs located on islands and in front of homes that have

920
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:20,076
[SPEAKER_22]: patches of grass that they're just putting down these lawn signs of private entities for advertising.

921
01:32:20,136 --> 01:32:26,460
[SPEAKER_22]: So if, other than the Scott Pelley for council, I think that we should definitely look into that.

922
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:27,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

923
01:32:28,281 --> 01:32:38,486
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could amend that, that the the building department also look at all the A-frames that are littering our sidewalks, which aren't supposed to be there either.

924
01:32:39,347 --> 01:32:39,587
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

925
01:32:41,467 --> 01:32:45,649
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

926
01:32:45,709 --> 01:32:46,330
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

927
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:46,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

928
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:49,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

929
01:32:49,711 --> 01:32:52,293
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-411 offered by Councilor Knight.

930
01:32:53,393 --> 01:33:10,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council thank Heidi Riccio for her four years of service to Medford Public Schools as vocational school principal and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council wish her all the best of luck in her new position at

931
01:33:10,943 --> 01:33:15,747
[SPEAKER_04]: of Career and Technical Education Director at Essex Technical High School.

932
01:33:19,591 --> 01:33:20,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

933
01:33:20,672 --> 01:33:22,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

934
01:33:22,153 --> 01:33:24,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I might need a box of tissues for this one.

935
01:33:25,015 --> 01:33:31,881
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple of weeks ago we saw Director Riccio here and she put in a great presentation concerning the capital needs and a request for

936
01:33:33,141 --> 01:33:36,322
[SPEAKER_09]: authorizing a grant proposal to go up to the Department of Education.

937
01:33:36,983 --> 01:33:45,146
[SPEAKER_09]: And we all commented about the work that she's done in her short time here in Medford and how she's moved the vocational school eons and eons ahead of where it was.

938
01:33:45,206 --> 01:33:49,728
[SPEAKER_09]: She's broke down the invisible wall between the high school and the vocational school.

939
01:33:49,768 --> 01:33:50,908
[SPEAKER_09]: She's added programming.

940
01:33:51,549 --> 01:33:54,430
[SPEAKER_09]: The programming that's been added has had a great impact on our bottom line.

941
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:59,292
[SPEAKER_09]: It's had an ability to prevent kids from transferring out of district to go to other schools that provide

942
01:34:00,316 --> 01:34:02,298
[SPEAKER_09]: programming that we didn't provide.

943
01:34:02,378 --> 01:34:13,766
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Mr. President, it's with great sadness, but also great pleasure to see Heidi moving on to something that is really worthwhile and an opportunity that she can't say no to.

944
01:34:14,086 --> 01:34:17,569
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a great sadness to see her to go because she's done great things in the city of Medford.

945
01:34:18,149 --> 01:34:21,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really just too bad that we have to see her go.

946
01:34:21,652 --> 01:34:26,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish we could have done more to recruit and keep her here, but we can't make people move closer to Medford, Mr. President.

947
01:34:26,175 --> 01:34:28,277
[SPEAKER_09]: She had quite a commute coming in there every day.

948
01:34:29,016 --> 01:34:34,319
[SPEAKER_09]: With that being said, I'd ask my colleagues to support this resolution and wish her the best of luck and thank her for her service to the city.

949
01:34:34,799 --> 01:34:35,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

950
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,161
[SPEAKER_22]: Councillor Scarpelli.

951
01:34:37,521 --> 01:34:41,103
[SPEAKER_22]: If I can, when the news broke, I did contact Ms.

952
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:57,032
[SPEAKER_22]: Riccio and as she wept over the phone and the decisions she had to make, I think the key decision to make her in this move was that her family

953
01:34:57,698 --> 01:34:58,539
[SPEAKER_22]: needed to come first.

954
01:34:58,599 --> 01:35:06,388
[SPEAKER_22]: She had two children that she was commuting up to four hours a day, and her commute is now, would be 20 minutes.

955
01:35:07,168 --> 01:35:17,480
[SPEAKER_22]: Her commitment to finishing the projects that she envisioned and she shared with us in the last month, she has already told her future

956
01:35:18,303 --> 01:35:26,106
[SPEAKER_22]: employer that she would make sure that she needs to finish those jobs and make sure they are completed before she moves on.

957
01:35:26,566 --> 01:35:28,647
[SPEAKER_22]: That's typical Heidi Riccio.

958
01:35:30,348 --> 01:35:41,793
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, being one of the school committee members that brought her to Medford and to see her vision come to fruition is

959
01:35:43,697 --> 01:35:44,277
[SPEAKER_22]: was amazing.

960
01:35:44,357 --> 01:35:48,839
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to miss her in many different ways.

961
01:35:49,399 --> 01:35:58,642
[SPEAKER_22]: She's been a great example how you can use different avenues to grow a major part of our community.

962
01:35:58,682 --> 01:35:59,762
[SPEAKER_22]: That's our vocational school.

963
01:35:59,782 --> 01:36:03,464
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.

964
01:36:04,084 --> 01:36:05,584
[SPEAKER_22]: And we also wish her luck.

965
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:07,785
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelley.

966
01:36:07,805 --> 01:36:08,565
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Falco.

967
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:09,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Caviello.

968
01:36:10,226 --> 01:36:13,027
[SPEAKER_19]: And also thank you to Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

969
01:36:14,075 --> 01:36:20,516
[SPEAKER_19]: I had the opportunity, along with Councilor Scarpelli, when we were on the school committee, to hire Heidi Riccio.

970
01:36:21,196 --> 01:36:29,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Hands down, I think one of the best moves that we made when we were on the school committee.

971
01:36:30,638 --> 01:36:31,978
[SPEAKER_19]: Her commitment is unquestionable.

972
01:36:32,339 --> 01:36:38,440
[SPEAKER_19]: The work that she did in four years to really turn that school around and to just bring

973
01:36:40,683 --> 01:36:42,584
[SPEAKER_19]: vocational education back to life is amazing.

974
01:36:42,664 --> 01:36:50,227
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the programs that she brought in, brought it to the school, the passion that she brings to the job is amazing.

975
01:36:50,707 --> 01:36:53,508
[SPEAKER_19]: And she just did a phenomenal job over four years.

976
01:36:53,568 --> 01:36:55,189
[SPEAKER_19]: She's going to definitely be missed.

977
01:36:55,989 --> 01:36:59,531
[SPEAKER_19]: But she did a fabulous job while she was here.

978
01:36:59,651 --> 01:37:00,851
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to say good luck.

979
01:37:01,572 --> 01:37:05,933
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think, you know, I mean, it's hard to see her go, but family comes first.

980
01:37:05,993 --> 01:37:07,274
[SPEAKER_19]: And I understand that completely.

981
01:37:07,474 --> 01:37:08,955
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just want to wish her well.

982
01:37:09,295 --> 01:37:09,575
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

983
01:37:11,275 --> 01:37:11,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Council Member Kern.

984
01:37:12,295 --> 01:37:13,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Carvillo.

985
01:37:13,655 --> 01:37:16,656
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to thank Councilman Lai for bringing this forward.

986
01:37:16,676 --> 01:37:18,216
[SPEAKER_18]: I thank Ms.

987
01:37:18,256 --> 01:37:19,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Riccio for all the work she's done.

988
01:37:19,857 --> 01:37:23,898
[SPEAKER_18]: It goes to show how much she has done.

989
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:34,880
[SPEAKER_18]: When you have parents calling you upset that a director is leaving, so it goes to show all the hard work that she's put into the program, which she explained to us in part a few weeks ago.

990
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:38,951
[SPEAKER_18]: she really impressed me before the council that night.

991
01:37:39,151 --> 01:37:43,312
[SPEAKER_18]: And then a week later she is now leaving, but I wish her the best of luck.

992
01:37:43,352 --> 01:37:54,755
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope that we are able to find somebody as enthusiastic and hardworking as her to keep the programs alive and going strong and create more opportunities for our, our young, uh, younger generation.

993
01:37:54,795 --> 01:38:00,576
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to thank her for that and, and hope that we can fill her shoes to the best of our ability.

994
01:38:01,637 --> 01:38:01,957
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

995
01:38:01,977 --> 01:38:02,557
[SPEAKER_22]: Counselor.

996
01:38:02,677 --> 01:38:03,417
[SPEAKER_22]: Counselor Scapelli.

997
01:38:03,843 --> 01:38:08,585
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, to that point, again, Mr. President, I know I forgot, but I wanted to make sure that when I talked to Ms.

998
01:38:08,605 --> 01:38:23,210
[SPEAKER_22]: Riccio, one of the things she was so proud of was the fact that when we as a school committee years ago looked for a new director, I believe we classified the three finalists as used car salesmen.

999
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:28,972
[SPEAKER_22]: And then coming across Heidi Riccio, what she mentioned to me that

1000
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:37,763
[SPEAKER_22]: Four years ago, method wasn't even in the world of vocational education, wasn't even on the map.

1001
01:38:39,344 --> 01:38:51,750
[SPEAKER_22]: And the interest gathered already from phone calls that vocational experts have been contacting her to apply for this job is astonishing.

1002
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:55,932
[SPEAKER_22]: So I can't wait to see what happens, but I know she's definitely

1003
01:38:57,590 --> 01:39:00,212
[SPEAKER_22]: helping with that piece, moving it forward.

1004
01:39:00,272 --> 01:39:05,336
[SPEAKER_22]: So I want to let our parents know that it's definitely different than it was four years ago.

1005
01:39:05,817 --> 01:39:14,404
[SPEAKER_22]: There'll be a line at the superintendent's door waiting to pass in their resumes for an opportunity to be the director of that program.

1006
01:39:14,524 --> 01:39:15,424
[SPEAKER_22]: So, thank you.

1007
01:39:15,605 --> 01:39:17,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

1008
01:39:17,966 --> 01:39:21,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Very big shoes to fill there, and I wish her well on her new endeavor.

1009
01:39:21,950 --> 01:39:25,172
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

1010
01:39:25,212 --> 01:39:25,893
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1011
01:39:26,798 --> 01:39:27,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1012
01:39:28,299 --> 01:39:31,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by Councilor Knight to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

1013
01:39:33,543 --> 01:39:35,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1014
01:39:35,525 --> 01:39:40,348
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1015
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:40,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1016
01:39:40,749 --> 01:39:51,317
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-415 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council wish lifelong resident Muriel Sullivan a very happy 90th birthday.

1017
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:52,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1018
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:53,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

1019
01:39:53,801 --> 01:39:55,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, Mary's still at home watching this evening.

1020
01:39:56,142 --> 01:40:00,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we had a few things we had to take care of at the beginning of the meeting, and we couldn't take this up under suspension.

1021
01:40:01,085 --> 01:40:04,687
[SPEAKER_09]: But Mary was born and raised in the city of Medford, has been a lifelong resident.

1022
01:40:04,867 --> 01:40:08,389
[SPEAKER_09]: She raised her four children, Maureen, Paul, John, and Julie, here in the community.

1023
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:11,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Her sister, Anne, still resides in Medford with her husband.

1024
01:40:12,472 --> 01:40:16,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And she has three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

1025
01:40:16,154 --> 01:40:18,275
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'd like to join me in wishing

1026
01:40:19,508 --> 01:40:19,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1027
01:40:19,728 --> 01:40:23,291
[SPEAKER_09]: O'Sullivan, a very happy 90th birthday, Mr. President, and many more to come.

1028
01:40:23,872 --> 01:40:25,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, and happy birthday.

1029
01:40:28,656 --> 01:40:40,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that Mae Marbrek, founder of Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and GMAC Gym, be recognized for her 25 years of distinguished service.

1030
01:40:40,266 --> 01:40:41,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Marks.

1031
01:40:42,067 --> 01:40:43,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1032
01:40:43,208 --> 01:40:45,030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my honor to stand up for

1033
01:40:45,732 --> 01:40:48,615
[SPEAKER_03]: such a tremendous person in this community.

1034
01:40:49,615 --> 01:40:56,101
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know May Makibrecht very well for her passion and her commitment to this community.

1035
01:40:56,121 --> 01:41:02,566
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, May was the founder of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and Gene Mack Gym.

1036
01:41:03,187 --> 01:41:06,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And she served for the past 25 years as a board member.

1037
01:41:07,201 --> 01:41:19,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that speaks volumes on her commitment, not only to Chevalier Auditorium, but also to the Meffitt Boys and Girls Club, which she was very passionate about, Mr. President.

1038
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:24,293
[SPEAKER_03]: May also served as a board member on the Brooks Estates Land Trust.

1039
01:41:24,837 --> 01:41:37,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe for still serving close to 18 or 19 years, a member of Cache and also the Method Arts Council and numerous other activities in the community.

1040
01:41:38,487 --> 01:41:39,447
[SPEAKER_03]: May has been there.

1041
01:41:40,148 --> 01:41:47,993
[SPEAKER_03]: She's someone that you can count on, someone that will always listen, Mr. President, and try to assist and never look for anything in return.

1042
01:41:48,794 --> 01:41:53,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to really wish her well and honor her

1043
01:41:53,813 --> 01:42:02,680
[SPEAKER_03]: before the Meffitt City Council for her many years of community service through a citation of this council, Mr. President.

1044
01:42:03,341 --> 01:42:18,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would ask that that be done within the next week or so to get May up here and congratulate her for not only being the founding member of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium, but also for her commitment to the

1045
01:42:19,203 --> 01:42:20,744
[SPEAKER_03]: community at large, Mr. President.

1046
01:42:20,964 --> 01:42:27,107
[SPEAKER_04]: She is going to be honored at the next board meeting of the Friends of Chevalier, if anyone wants to go to that.

1047
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:28,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Nice.

1048
01:42:29,349 --> 01:42:30,830
[SPEAKER_09]: I second the resolution, Mr. President.

1049
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:31,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Move for approval.

1050
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:35,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's also important to point out she is a member of the Medford Mustang Hall of Fame.

1051
01:42:36,413 --> 01:42:37,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Former Citizen of the Year also.

1052
01:42:38,033 --> 01:42:38,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Former Citizen of the Year.

1053
01:42:40,435 --> 01:42:41,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lockern.

1054
01:42:41,315 --> 01:42:42,396
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Carviel.

1055
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:43,236
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to mention that.

1056
01:42:43,356 --> 01:42:44,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Former Citizen of the Year.

1057
01:42:45,678 --> 01:42:45,998
[SPEAKER_18]: May is

1058
01:42:46,604 --> 01:42:57,154
[SPEAKER_18]: done so much for this city on a volunteer basis, which is a reason why she was the citizen of the year a few years back, and I want to thank her for her service.

1059
01:42:57,854 --> 01:43:00,637
[SPEAKER_18]: She is being honored on May 18th at 7 p.m.

1060
01:43:00,657 --> 01:43:06,302
[SPEAKER_18]: at Maple Park Condominiums Community Room, 65 Valley Street in Medford.

1061
01:43:07,082 --> 01:43:12,968
[SPEAKER_18]: So whether we give her a citation here or at that meeting, I just want to thank her for all her service.

1062
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:14,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Tremendous.

1063
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:15,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councillor.

1064
01:43:15,701 --> 01:43:16,741
[SPEAKER_04]: An outstanding woman.

1065
01:43:19,503 --> 01:43:23,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only has she been a mentor to me, but she's been a good friend for many years.

1066
01:43:24,326 --> 01:43:25,006
[SPEAKER_19]: Councillor Falco.

1067
01:43:25,306 --> 01:43:25,806
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1068
01:43:25,826 --> 01:43:29,568
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to say thank you to May.

1069
01:43:29,588 --> 01:43:37,733
[SPEAKER_19]: She's been an amazing citizen, been involved in so many organizations through the years, and her commitment is fabulous.

1070
01:43:37,993 --> 01:43:42,395
[SPEAKER_19]: She's done a great job, and I just want to say thank you for all your service to our community.

1071
01:43:43,881 --> 01:43:50,863
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Marks that we have made my brick, uh, come up here for a citation, uh, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1072
01:43:51,924 --> 01:43:52,664
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

1073
01:43:53,644 --> 01:43:54,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1074
01:43:56,365 --> 01:43:57,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by vice president marks.

1075
01:43:57,725 --> 01:44:08,169
[SPEAKER_04]: We have resolved that the tree stumps located at 51 woods road, 56 woods road in 18 Wellington road be removed.

1076
01:44:08,829 --> 01:44:09,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice president marks.

1077
01:44:10,829 --> 01:44:11,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1078
01:44:12,270 --> 01:44:12,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

1079
01:44:13,737 --> 01:44:25,245
[SPEAKER_03]: There are still a number of stumps, Mr. President, throughout this community that appear to be on the stump list but, for whatever reason, are taking forever to remove from in front of residents' homes.

1080
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:35,513
[SPEAKER_03]: These are three that were brought to my attention just recently over the weekend, and I know there are literally tens and tens more, Mr. President.

1081
01:44:35,533 --> 01:44:40,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I would ask that these be removed immediately in the interest of public safety.

1082
01:44:41,337 --> 01:44:44,539
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, Mr. President, that we receive an updated list.

1083
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:53,065
[SPEAKER_03]: We were asked, I believe it was eight months ago, maybe a year, for monies to do sidewalk and stump removal.

1084
01:44:53,445 --> 01:45:07,695
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can get an updated list on where we stand with that, and the age of the stumps, as we've talked about, Mr. President, ad nauseum before this council, and that we get a report back from the Commissioner Brian Kerentz.

1085
01:45:08,773 --> 01:45:09,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Member Keran.

1086
01:45:09,853 --> 01:45:11,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1087
01:45:12,154 --> 01:45:13,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for bringing this up, Council Member Marks.

1088
01:45:13,814 --> 01:45:20,856
[SPEAKER_18]: I also have been getting repeated emails if we could add 17, 48, and 61 Doonan Street.

1089
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:33,840
[SPEAKER_18]: Those stumps have been there for a very long time and I did request through an email to Mr. Keran's that they would be removed if we could get a status on that and vote in favor of removing those stumps.

1090
01:45:34,676 --> 01:45:41,358
[SPEAKER_18]: people get sick and tired of stumps in their neighborhoods and on their streets, and it's understandable, it's an eyesore.

1091
01:45:41,919 --> 01:45:46,660
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we could get those removed, it's also a public safety issue, so thank you.

1092
01:45:48,001 --> 01:45:48,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1093
01:45:49,001 --> 01:45:50,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

1094
01:45:50,082 --> 01:45:52,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Councilor Moxley, for bringing this resolution forward.

1095
01:45:52,323 --> 01:46:00,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I, too, had a conversation with Public Works Director Cairns this afternoon, and he's informed me that there will be two sidewalk crews that will be out in the coming weeks.

1096
01:46:01,446 --> 01:46:04,307
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the crews is a city crew, one of the crews is a National Grid crew.

1097
01:46:05,128 --> 01:46:19,781
[SPEAKER_09]: The national grid crew will be dealing with sidewalk panels that they've disturbed during their construction over the last year, and the city crew will be working on the stump and sidewalk money that we appropriated some months back, Mr. President.

1098
01:46:20,081 --> 01:46:21,703
[SPEAKER_09]: But I appreciate the resolution going forward.

1099
01:46:21,723 --> 01:46:23,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I support it wholeheartedly, and I move for approval.

1100
01:46:23,904 --> 01:46:24,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Fevella.

1101
01:46:25,626 --> 01:46:26,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Caviello.

1102
01:46:26,527 --> 01:46:28,568
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to thank Councilor Moxley for bringing this forward.

1103
01:46:28,609 --> 01:46:31,331
[SPEAKER_19]: If we could also add 23 Fulton Street to the list.

1104
01:46:34,607 --> 01:46:49,673
[SPEAKER_19]: I got a call about that recently, and I'm glad, and actually, I believe the list that Councilor Moxson mentioned was supposed to be forwarded to us a while ago, so I'm glad that you mentioned that as well, because we should get an updated list to see what kind of progress is being made.

1105
01:46:50,133 --> 01:46:51,774
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of money has gone into this, so.

1106
01:46:52,654 --> 01:46:52,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1107
01:46:53,014 --> 01:46:53,314
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1108
01:46:54,795 --> 01:47:02,938
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor, by Vice President Mox, as amended by Councilor Longo Kern and Councilor Falco,

1109
01:47:03,577 --> 01:47:05,498
[SPEAKER_04]: and seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

1110
01:47:06,218 --> 01:47:07,058
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1111
01:47:07,079 --> 01:47:07,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1112
01:47:08,299 --> 01:47:09,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1113
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:28,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the city administration provide a copy of the city's affordable housing plan and be it further resolved that the city report back to the council that the percentage of housing units in the city that are considered affordable.

1114
01:47:28,788 --> 01:47:29,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1115
01:47:30,753 --> 01:47:32,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1116
01:47:32,053 --> 01:47:35,574
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been much discussion about development in the community, much discussion about zoning.

1117
01:47:36,815 --> 01:47:48,038
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that we all need to be wary of is Chapter 40B of the General Laws, which allows developers to bypass the local zoning laws if the city of Medford is not at its threshold established by the state standard for affordable housing.

1118
01:47:48,658 --> 01:47:53,019
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask that the administration provide those reports to us so that we can take a look at them as we prepare our discussions.

1119
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:54,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1120
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:57,921
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Naif, seconded by Councilor De La

1121
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:00,241
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favour?

1122
01:48:01,101 --> 01:48:02,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1123
01:48:03,543 --> 01:48:09,007
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can set a reminder out, Saturday is Clippership Day in the City of Medford.

1124
01:48:09,968 --> 01:48:17,574
[SPEAKER_04]: If everyone can come out and attend, it's something that's been brought back, that's been gone for a while, and I hope everybody can attend.

1125
01:48:18,034 --> 01:48:18,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Langel-Kern.

1126
01:48:19,592 --> 01:48:19,812
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1127
01:48:19,852 --> 01:48:25,717
[SPEAKER_18]: I just had a feeling you were going to maybe forget the details by the way you were ending that.

1128
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:27,739
[SPEAKER_18]: 12 p.m.

1129
01:48:27,799 --> 01:48:37,367
[SPEAKER_18]: to 9 p.m., right in the center of Medford Square, there's going to be a cornhole tournament, a number of activities for the children, beer and wine, a stage.

1130
01:48:37,787 --> 01:48:40,129
[SPEAKER_18]: You may know better more of what's going on on the stage.

1131
01:48:40,189 --> 01:48:40,690
[SPEAKER_18]: I forget.

1132
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:43,552
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's going to be a great family event.

1133
01:48:43,772 --> 01:48:45,334
[SPEAKER_18]: The street's going to be closed off.

1134
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:51,619
[SPEAKER_18]: parking won't, I don't think parking is going to be an issue if that, that issue was cleared up, but it's going to be a great day.

1135
01:48:51,639 --> 01:48:54,480
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of family fun and, um, great community day.

1136
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:55,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Good community fun.

1137
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:57,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1138
01:48:59,581 --> 01:49:00,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice-president Mox.

1139
01:49:01,081 --> 01:49:08,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if I could, Mr. President, I had the opportunity this past Saturday to attend the community cleanup, uh, which we refer to as earth day.

1140
01:49:10,736 --> 01:49:15,878
[SPEAKER_03]: We had cleanups in Haines Square, West Meffitt Square, right here in the heart of Meffitt Square.

1141
01:49:16,318 --> 01:49:20,720
[SPEAKER_03]: The Brooks Estates held a cleanup, McDonnell Park along the Mystic River.

1142
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:23,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were many, many volunteers out that day.

1143
01:49:23,941 --> 01:49:25,742
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a beautiful day.

1144
01:49:26,522 --> 01:49:30,384
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mystic River Watershed Association had many volunteers.

1145
01:49:30,884 --> 01:49:36,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Meffitt Community Coalition organized their group and they did a tremendous job here in Meffitt Square.

1146
01:49:36,886 --> 01:49:38,047
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chamber of Commerce,

1147
01:49:38,597 --> 01:49:46,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Also was very instrumental, members of MBELT, help at the Brooks Estates, and DPW.

1148
01:49:46,463 --> 01:49:59,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to thank personally Steve Tanaglia, who did a tremendous job, Mr. President, in making sure that there were brooms and rakes and bags and things were picked up after all this trash was picked up.

1149
01:49:59,712 --> 01:50:03,695
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank everyone in the community for a great cleanup day.

1150
01:50:04,455 --> 01:50:06,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, Mr. President,

1151
01:50:07,424 --> 01:50:11,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's only appropriate that the farmer's market will be moving.

1152
01:50:12,587 --> 01:50:21,432
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know it's been in Meffitt Square for a number of years, and they have a new location, which will be the Condon Shell on Mystic Valley Parkway.

1153
01:50:22,193 --> 01:50:27,736
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first farmer's market will be June 8th, and it's gonna run until October 12th.

1154
01:50:28,276 --> 01:50:30,317
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be from three to seven p.m.

1155
01:50:31,078 --> 01:50:33,799
[SPEAKER_03]: every Thursday from June 8th to October 12th.

1156
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:36,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's plenty of parking there,

1157
01:50:37,598 --> 01:50:43,901
[SPEAKER_03]: running water and electricity, and supposedly it's going to be a great location for the market itself.

1158
01:50:45,142 --> 01:50:48,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Mr. President, I just want to bring up Circle the Square.

1159
01:50:49,464 --> 01:50:59,989
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that for several weeks during the June-July months, I believe up until August, they run Circle the Square.

1160
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:02,991
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, they're only going to run it once.

1161
01:51:03,791 --> 01:51:06,913
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be one Circle the Square date, that is Thursday,

1162
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:09,671
[SPEAKER_03]: June 15th from 3.30 to 7.30.

1163
01:51:11,373 --> 01:51:34,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reasoning they're only going to have one is because there is exciting renovations being made on Riverside Plaza, on Riverside F. And I guess for that reason, Circle the Square will only have one date this year, which I'm not sure why they can't use other parts of the square, but that's the notice that went out.

1164
01:51:34,747 --> 01:51:36,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Mr. President, if I could,

1165
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a wealth of knowledge tonight.

1166
01:51:38,481 --> 01:51:38,781
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

1167
01:51:38,961 --> 01:51:39,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Wealth of knowledge tonight.

1168
01:51:40,002 --> 01:51:41,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's important, Mr. President.

1169
01:51:42,924 --> 01:51:46,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Upcoming events, Cachet has an arts and cultural calendar.

1170
01:51:47,127 --> 01:51:49,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Back pocket dances, I think Councilor Scott Pelley.

1171
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:54,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard people say you're in the back pocket, is it not dances?

1172
01:51:54,512 --> 01:51:56,033
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's dance.

1173
01:51:56,113 --> 01:51:57,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's dance, okay.

1174
01:51:57,954 --> 01:52:01,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Back pocket dances, Saturday, May 6th from 3 p.m.

1175
01:52:01,236 --> 01:52:01,656
[SPEAKER_03]: and 7.30 p.m.

1176
01:52:04,461 --> 01:52:28,408
[SPEAKER_03]: at the Meffitt Senior Center, 101 Riverside Ave, and then Bluegrass and Beyond, I think Councilor De La Russa likes Bluegrass, a night of American music, and that's gonna be Saturday, May 13th, at Chevalier Theater at 8 p.m., Mr. President, all welcomed, and the Friends of the Meffitt Public Library book sale, Saturday, May 20th, and Sunday, the 21st, at all various times.

1177
01:52:29,829 --> 01:52:31,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all for today, Mr. President.

1178
01:52:31,769 --> 01:52:32,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1179
01:52:34,141 --> 01:52:37,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I'm very surprised that counselor marks missed one.

1180
01:52:38,124 --> 01:52:39,365
[SPEAKER_09]: The airplane noise meeting.

1181
01:52:39,425 --> 01:52:39,766
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1182
01:52:39,826 --> 01:52:42,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Monday, Monday night, 7 p.m.

1183
01:52:42,748 --> 01:52:48,112
[SPEAKER_09]: in the council chambers and our representatives from the mass port CLC will be there.

1184
01:52:49,213 --> 01:52:49,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1185
01:52:49,554 --> 01:52:51,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor.

1186
01:52:51,435 --> 01:52:51,855
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1187
01:52:52,056 --> 01:52:53,217
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, president.

1188
01:52:54,057 --> 01:53:00,062
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually, I am surprised that everyone missed this one, but tomorrow night is the method police community meeting.

1189
01:53:00,382 --> 01:53:02,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, it is at the Bedford senior center and it starts at 6 p.m.

1190
01:53:04,114 --> 01:53:04,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone is welcome.

1191
01:53:05,215 --> 01:53:05,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1192
01:53:05,635 --> 01:53:10,677
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and if I may really quick, um, I was also at the, uh, cleanup this weekend in the square.

1193
01:53:10,717 --> 01:53:15,279
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you to the, uh, community coalition and to the DPW department as well.

1194
01:53:15,299 --> 01:53:16,359
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody did a fine job.

1195
01:53:16,599 --> 01:53:17,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of our city council were there.

1196
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:21,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you, would you like to speak?

1197
01:53:21,281 --> 01:53:22,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1198
01:53:22,522 --> 01:53:25,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Valerie Geiselman, Medford, Massachusetts.

1199
01:53:25,283 --> 01:53:28,665
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to thank councilor Marks for just giving a list of all those dates.

1200
01:53:28,725 --> 01:53:31,646
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wondered if there's a place where we can find easily,

1201
01:53:32,053 --> 01:53:34,895
[SPEAKER_17]: find all the dates of the events that are happening in Medford.

1202
01:53:35,435 --> 01:53:36,756
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll tell you my reason why.

1203
01:53:37,637 --> 01:53:41,640
[SPEAKER_17]: On the way here to the meeting, I stopped in at this new restaurant.

1204
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:43,341
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's pronounced Zam Zam.

1205
01:53:43,921 --> 01:53:47,584
[SPEAKER_17]: And they have Pakistani and Indian cuisine.

1206
01:53:47,604 --> 01:53:49,125
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the second time I've stopped in there.

1207
01:53:49,565 --> 01:53:51,046
[SPEAKER_17]: And they seem like a lovely place.

1208
01:53:51,466 --> 01:53:55,969
[SPEAKER_17]: I asked them if they knew about participating in the June 4 event, Medford Day.

1209
01:53:56,049 --> 01:53:57,110
[SPEAKER_17]: They didn't even know about it.

1210
01:53:57,590 --> 01:53:59,271
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mentioned a few other things to them.

1211
01:53:59,652 --> 01:54:01,013
[SPEAKER_17]: And when the new petitioners

1212
01:54:01,975 --> 01:54:10,542
[SPEAKER_17]: We're also speaking tonight, the ones that are, let's see, taking over the, I'm trying to see.

1213
01:54:10,562 --> 01:54:11,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinky's Pizza and Helen's Roast Beef.

1214
01:54:12,503 --> 01:54:12,924
[SPEAKER_17]: What'd you say?

1215
01:54:13,304 --> 01:54:15,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinky's Pizza and Helen's Roast Beef.

1216
01:54:15,926 --> 01:54:20,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Pinky's Pizza and Helen's Roast Beef.

1217
01:54:20,369 --> 01:54:30,057
[SPEAKER_17]: And I went out to speak to them and welcomed them to Medford and I was so happy some of these are in my neighborhood and I'd be happy when they're opening up and the places aren't empty anymore.

1218
01:54:30,423 --> 01:54:33,724
[SPEAKER_17]: And I asked them about June 4th, if they would be interested in participating.

1219
01:54:33,784 --> 01:54:34,905
[SPEAKER_17]: And they didn't even know about it.

1220
01:54:34,965 --> 01:54:39,846
[SPEAKER_17]: And they didn't know about the events that happen up at Tufts College, where they might be able to participate.

1221
01:54:40,207 --> 01:54:46,129
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wonder if there's any way we could have some ambassadors to welcome these new businesses in Medford.

1222
01:54:46,189 --> 01:54:47,869
[SPEAKER_17]: It's so wonderful to have them coming in.

1223
01:54:47,889 --> 01:54:54,292
[SPEAKER_17]: And we know what a risk it is for, especially young people or anybody, any age, to start a new business in Medford.

1224
01:54:54,312 --> 01:54:54,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be you.

1225
01:54:57,378 --> 01:54:57,719
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1226
01:54:59,519 --> 01:55:00,659
[SPEAKER_17]: How about the high school kids?

1227
01:55:00,699 --> 01:55:01,980
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, this is a wonderful thing.

1228
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,140
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a chamber of commerce.

1229
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:04,420
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Facebook.

1230
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:10,362
[SPEAKER_04]: There's multiple outlets for these people to, multiple resources for them to find out.

1231
01:55:10,402 --> 01:55:11,582
[SPEAKER_17]: But they don't know about them.

1232
01:55:11,662 --> 01:55:13,023
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we need to reach out.

1233
01:55:13,083 --> 01:55:15,383
[SPEAKER_04]: If they were good business people, they would know where to find them.

1234
01:55:15,403 --> 01:55:17,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we want them to be good business people.

1235
01:55:17,884 --> 01:55:24,366
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we have to help educate them so they can have a successful business of Medford, I think it would be good to have some ambassadors to do that.

1236
01:55:24,758 --> 01:55:25,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1237
01:55:25,418 --> 01:55:25,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Nye.

1238
01:55:26,218 --> 01:55:35,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, motion to request that the administration examine the feasibility of allowing the senior citizen abatement program to work as ambassadors between new businesses in the community and city hall.

1239
01:55:36,042 --> 01:55:36,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1240
01:55:36,402 --> 01:55:39,663
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Nye, seconded by Councilor Delco.

1241
01:55:40,143 --> 01:55:40,803
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor.

1242
01:55:41,023 --> 01:55:41,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1243
01:55:41,744 --> 01:55:42,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1244
01:55:43,904 --> 01:55:48,826
[SPEAKER_04]: The records were passed to Vice President Mox.

1245
01:55:49,146 --> 01:55:51,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Vice President, how did you find those records?
