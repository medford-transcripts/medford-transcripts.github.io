    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=0.351s">Investments</a>  in our school children continue today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4.815s">Augmented</a>  security measures in our centers would not be possible without the collaboration with our public safety professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=20.069s">Safety</a>  is a core component to an individual's comfort in and desire to be in a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=26.038s">We</a>  have invested in state-of-the-art self-contained breathing apparatus for our firefighters and a second set of turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=31.961s">Thank</a>  you, Medford City Council for voting that last night, for supporting this initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=37.283s">These</a>  are to provide the most current apparatus for firefighters' safety and ultimately for your safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=43.806s">Nine</a>  new firefighters graduated the academy last month and one entered this past Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=48.989s">We</a>  are working hard to keep up with retirements by accelerating the civil service process. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=55.516s">Kudos</a>  to our Board of Health for receipt of a seven-year, 100,000 per year grant from the Mass Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Abuse to provide opiate abuse prevention services for six cities and towns in our area. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=69.046s">We</a>  all understand the impact this drug has on our society, and we are making every effort to raise awareness, erase the stigma, and provide assistance for those suffering from addiction, as well as support for their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=91.628s">We</a>  have formed a team approach under Mary Ann O'Connor, who recently came to us in the last several months, for our prevention and outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=99.27s">We</a>  have an outreach manager, a recovery coach, we work with Lawrence Morell Hospital, and the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=105.952s">Every</a>  life matters, and we thank our police and firefighters for volunteering to administer NACAN in this cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=113.794s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=121.66s">And</a>  while we are not to clear the trust at Citi, be assured that our police department protocols do not allow for profiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=129.222s">Witnesses</a>  and victims are not asked about their immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=132.823s">So</a>  be sure and ask your lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=135.084s">If</a>  you can ask me what the question posed to me most often, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=147.649s">I</a>  would have to say, it's when are we getting a new police station? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=151.511s">I</a>  hear day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=154.612s">And</a>  today, just this morning, I announced that we will be submitting a loan order to the city council next week on February 14th, requesting funds to commission an architect to begin the plans for a new station. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=166.378s">We</a>  have turned the city upside down looking for a new location. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=170.26s">We've</a>  toured commercial spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=172.441s">We've</a>  contacted property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=174.382s">Property</a>  owners have contacted us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=176.62s">And</a>  in the end, the right location with no land cost and no relocation during construction is the current site of the training facility on Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=195.843s">The</a>  current facility will be demolished, and the proposed 35,000 square foot, three-story new construction will house all amenities of the state-of-the-art resilient headquarters, including deserved equal space for our female and male officers, technology upgrades, and most importantly, safe interior space for our office's well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=215.227s">Public</a>  safety investments continue today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=229.12s">In</a>  conclusion, this city of ours, this great city of ours, continues to move forward on a foundation built on dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=237.884s">A</a>  dialogue that echoes in this building, allowing the voices of all residents to be heard with an attitude of inclusion and fairness. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=246.629s">A</a>  dialogue of renewal, where creative and imaginative ideas are brought forward to better the quality of life in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=254.158s">A</a>  dialogue that resonates with the message that Medford is on the move, embracing a future of possibilities, embracing a future of hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=263.222s">On</a>  this night, in our beautiful City Hall, and I say that the state of our city is sound, it is stable, and it is sturdy. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=282.114s">And</a>  as your mayor, I stand as committed as ever to foster this dialogue with you as we continue to cultivate a city on which we can be partners in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=292.92s">God</a>  bless Medford, the commonwealth, and the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=296.922s">Thank</a>  you all very much for being here this evening, and good night, and be safe tomorrow with the upcoming blizzard. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=302.885s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[7G1mRGUN6Dk_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=353.553s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=355.215s">Are</a>  you inspired? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=364.86s">I</a>  was thinking, I don't like the sound stable and sturdy, because that sounds so sound, stable and sturdy. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=375.553s">And</a>  I was thinking that it felt pretty spectacular and scintillating and safe for all and Stephanie. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=391.58s">to</a>  do something for me, citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=395.042s">I</a>  wonder if, for just a minute, we can have all of our elected and staff, city staff, sit down for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=403.926s">Elected</a>  and city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=405.887s">And</a>  everybody else, I'm gonna ask you to help me bless these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=411.509s">Would</a>  you just extend a hand towards the people who are serving you today? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=419.175s">for</a>  it continues today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=421.776s">And</a>  join me in the spirit of blessing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=425.178s">Great,</a>  loving, forgiving spirit of the universe, God of all that is, God of this city, God of these people, God of goodness and change and sturdiness and future and yesterday and today, it continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=448.035s">And</a>  so we ask your blessing on these good people who we have elected and we have given the responsibility to serve us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=456.738s">We</a>  thank you for their wisdom, for their courage, for the day-to-day doing it all to make us sturdy and stable and sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=469.542s">Help</a>  them to be courageous as we go from this night. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=473.682s">Help</a>  them to be that which we need in this city to make us scintillating and exciting and future-oriented at the same time that we are grounded in all that we have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=488.774s">God,</a>  we thank you, and we ask your blessing on all of these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=494.198s">And</a>  now, if you'll all stand back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=497.167s">I</a>  will bless us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=498.567s">May</a>  God continue today to bless us and keep us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=503.408s">May</a>  God continue today to show us the way and to be gracious to us, to shine upon us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=511.59s">May</a>  God continue today to look upon Medford with kindness and grace and love. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=519.652s">And</a>  we pray all of this in the name of love. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=521.933s">Let</a>  the people say amen.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=538.45s">she</a>  prayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=539.793s">Lieutenant</a>  Casey, retire the colors.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=573.157s">Prepare</a>  to halt.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=637.797s">Thank</a>  you all, and the mayor kindly invites you to gather for some refreshments, some pastries and some coffee out in the rotunda. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=649.332s">The</a>  munchkins out there have eaten them all up by now.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1528.012s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1530.753s">17th</a>  regular meeting of the Medford City Council, May 2nd, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1535.054s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1552.88s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1554.961s">I</a>  pledge allegiance <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1569.277s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Knight to suspend the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1571.759s">Seconded</a>  by? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1573.86s">By</a>  Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1575.221s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1576.142s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to take a paper from the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1578.583s">Paper</a>  from the table.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1598.971s">17-414</a>  to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1606.143s">Dear</a>  Mr. President, City Council, I respectfully request to recommend that your honorable body approve the following transfer of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1613.386s">Amount,</a>  22,400 from account 010-102-5110-1112. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1615.466s">Account</a>  010-151-5110. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1633.905s">The</a>  purpose of this transfer is to appropriate the funds for the assistant city solicitor position as classification was changed from CAF 10, CAF 12 per request of the city council during the fiscal 17 budget deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1650.272s">In</a>  addition, solicitor Romley had a request in this budget narrative that the law office assistant position be reclassified from CAF 3, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1660.332s">to</a>  see a four. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1661.633s">So</a>  it's a run lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1662.454s">We'll</a>  be here to answer any questions that we may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1669.479s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo of approval on the motion by Councilor of Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1675.924s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1676.864s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, this appears to be housekeeping to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1679.266s">The</a>  council had voted to approve a change in the classification of the assistant city solicitor during last year's budget debates. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1684.57s">Um,</a>  and this looks like it's housekeeping to make sure that the accounts line up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1687.456s">I'm</a>  hoping that the city solicitor will be able to come up here and confirm that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1690.199s">And</a>  then I'd be happy to second council Dello Russo's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1694.404s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1699.63s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1700.09s">I</a>  was distracted. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1700.851s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1702.893s">Oh,</a>  I am Mr. Solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1703.895s">I'm</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1704.335s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1704.916s">Um,</a>  the question that I would like to have it back, um, would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1709.1s">This</a>  is just a housekeeping matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1710.261s">During</a>  the budget debates last year, we voted to approve an increase in the salary of the Assistant City Solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1715.645s">And</a>  this is just a- Yes, this is the appropriation which would take care of the increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1719.027s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1719.768s">That's</a>  really the long and short of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1721.509s">It</a>  would have been nice if this had been done concurrently with the reclassification, but it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1725.772s">So,</a>  this is necessary in order for us to be able to finish the fiscal year, everything square.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1734.138s">Mr.</a>  President, based on that explanation, I would second Councilor Dello Russo's motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1739.473s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor, is this not a change of classification?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1914.702s">Name</a>  and address of the director, please.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1916.558s">Good</a>  evening, honorable Councilors, Aleesha Nunley, finance director for the city of Medford and through the chair to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1922.961s">Uh,</a>  yes, this would be streamlining. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1924.662s">The</a>  whole accounting would be a lot easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1927.163s">We</a>  would still have two revenue streams to count for the sewer and water, but all expenses would be shared between the two.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1960.377s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1961.637s">Robert</a>  Penza, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1965.739s">I</a>  can appreciate the fact that you folks want to incorporate the water and sewer account together, and as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1969.96s">Notley</a>  just indicated, you got permission from the Department of Revenue, from my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1974.202s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1975.965s">But</a>  with that being said, the water and sewer rate does have a section in there that talks about any surplus that's in there for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1985.187s">And</a>  if, in fact, the surplus is not being used for a project that will begin within a 90-day period of time, and they're sitting on approximately $8 million, that those monies should be returned back to the Medford taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=1999.05s">Now,</a>  you just had a committee of the whole meeting tonight to talk about a new connectivity charge that is being proposed by the Water and Sewer Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2006.413s">but</a>  there was no discussion as it related to what's gonna happen to the eight and a half million dollars that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2011.958s">And</a>  I would like to make a strong suggestion that the council amend your vote or make it a B paper asking either for the city solicitor, I mean for the city engineer and or the water and sewer department to have a plan presented to folks ready to go within 90 days or that those monies are revert back to the Metro taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2035.494s">I</a>  think it's just fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2036.815s">We</a>  keep talking and we keep hearing over and beyond, over and over, that we have money in this surplus account. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2042.816s">And</a>  as it was explained to us— Point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2046.077s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2047.258s">Am</a>  I correct that the paper before us is as to whether or not we want to combine the accounts, not whether or not we're really looking at how the accounts are utilized, but whether or not we're really just allowing the finance director to combine the two accounts for accounting purposes and to eliminate duplication of efforts? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2060.481s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2060.782s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2061.122s">That</a>  is the purpose of the paper.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2062.914s">And</a>  besides having it for accounting purposes, there is a usage factor in there by emerging the two, which also has a surplus of eight and a half or thereabouts millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2071.677s">Again,</a>  if the city has no intention of using that money for a project ready to go within 90 days, the money, according to the law, needs to be returned back to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2080.44s">So</a>  what I respectfully ask any one of my colleagues, or was in a joint motion, that the city sit down immediately to find out if there is going to be a project within 90 days that's going to be operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2090.303s">Don't</a>  forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2091.64s">For</a>  years, this money's been sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2093.461s">So</a>  as a result of that, it's either use it or give it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2097.984s">It's</a>  unfortunate that you have accumulated that kind of an account with that kind of money, but not any ongoing projects ready to go for that money to be utilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2107.21s">And</a>  I think that just fits into the parameters of the way the law was written.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2475.474s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2477.055s">I</a>  had the opportunity last week to attend <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2480.462s">uh,</a>  a business, uh, neighborhood meeting, uh, regarding the, uh, proposed work that's going to be done at bargain spot Lickers, the West method parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2491.108s">Uh,</a>  it has been mentioned before this council on a number of occasions, uh, there has been a contamination found underground and, uh, the city is in the process of removing the contaminants, uh, through a high water, uh, injection, uh, multiple injections, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2509.13s">into</a>  the ground over a sustained period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2513.215s">While</a>  this takes place, Mr. President, we were told by the city engineer as well as the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2519.605s">and</a>  as well as the consultant that was hired by the city that this parking lot will not be able to have any parking accommodations for a three phased approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2536.182s">The</a>  first phase I believe will last at least <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2540.139s">I</a>  think it was 21 to 30 days that was mentioned of injections, followed by a phase two process, depending on how successful they are with phase one, that could range anywhere from five to 10 days, depending on what's left over, and then an eventual phase three. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2559.375s">The</a>  reason why I offer this resolution, Mr. President, is the parking lot behind the Bargain Spot Liquors is a place where many <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2569.464s">patrons</a>  park to frequent the West Medford businesses and actually many businesses will also use that as a place where deliveries could be had, a place where people can come and do some temporary parking to run in and <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2589.219s">do</a>  deliveries and other things in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2592.98s">And</a>  when we remove these 35 spots, it's gonna become increasingly difficult for people to come in and traverse this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2601.944s">There</a>  is a plan by the police department to relax some of the parking restrictions in the area for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2610.207s">There's</a>  discussion about also using the tip of Playstead Park for some additional parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2618.217s">And</a>  this resolution actually was from business owners that approached me after the meeting asking that if we could temporarily relocate the bus stop in front of Bargain Spot Liquors, they could pick up four spots in the heart of West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2634.968s">And</a>  we took a walk along the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2637.57s">We</a>  took a walk up to 422 High Street and also in front of Brookline Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2643.914s">And</a>  I think we found a perfect location <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2647.171s">temporary</a>  location that's handicap accessible, because that'll be the first thing the MBTA requires of the city if we move the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2655.798s">And</a>  indeed, we did see accessibility ramps on the corner of Canal and High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2664.265s">And</a>  I would ask at this time, Mr. President, in the interest of providing more parking at a time that it's needed in West Medford Square, that this council vote tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2675.619s">to</a>  request immediately that the MBTA go out there and move the spot between Brookline Bank and 422 High Street in the interest of adding additional parking spots in West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2689.683s">We</a>  also have a number of the business owners, Mr. President, that would like to, I think one or two would like to come up and say a few words regarding how important this is to business and the general vicinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2703.006s">And</a>  at this time, if we can allow <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2705.885s">business</a>  owners to get up, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2707.446s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2708.788s">Would</a>  anyone like to speak in this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2713.972s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2714.452s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2771.636s">You</a>  did such a good job, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2773.438s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2775.039s">Mr.</a>  President, I certainly support this paper wholeheartedly, and I also think that in light of the fact that the majority of these business owners in West Medford do purchase <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2783.889s">business</a>  permits, and this is the business permit lot, that there should be a pro-ratio abatement to the business permit holder for the period of time equivalent to the amount of days that the lot is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2796.394s">So</a>  I'd like to include that as part of the paper, that the Traffic Commission provide a pro-ratio abatement to the cost of a business permit in the equivalent of the number of days that the individuals that are in possession of the business permit <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2812.951s">are</a>  unable to access the lot.</p>

    <p>[Steven Pompeo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2814.933s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2815.293s">Name</a>  and address of the wreckage. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2817.855s">Steven</a>  Pompeo, 18 Newton Road, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2820.437s">Thank</a>  you to Councilor Marks for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2822.399s">This</a>  is going to be very helpful during this process where they're taking away the 35 parking spots in the parking lot for that period of 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2831.927s">It'll</a>  also give an opportunity to test out that spot temporarily to see if it is potentially <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2837.842s">a</a>  long-term solution for moving that bus stop, but at least temporarily for the short term, I'd like the council to support that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2846.252s">This</a>  is a project I've been involved in since 2009 when it became a problem, and I know a lot of the business owners can't be here tonight because most of them in West Medford are still open and working. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2856.003s">But</a>  during the meeting that Councilor Marks spoke about and at other meetings we've had the consensus has generally been that moving that bus stop would Temporarily would be great to providing more spots right in the heart during this process There's been a number of other Suggestions made to do to help with this situation as well one of them <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2878.615s">would</a>  be to step up the enforcement of High Street during this rather than, there's been some suggestions to, and they're in good faith, to eliminate paid parking during this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2893.287s">And</a>  if that discussion comes up, I'd just like to say that most of the businesses in West Medford would prefer to have the enforcement stepped up during this process because the businesses want to leave High Street itself <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2903.836s">for</a>  the customers and try to find alternative places for the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2910.079s">The</a>  tip of Placetet Park was one that's going to come up in front of the Park Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2915.102s">And</a>  that's a great suggestion on where to put the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2917.563s">But</a>  if it does come up, we'd like to also have support to double the parking enforcement on High Street so that the traffic gets moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2925.107s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2925.788s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[mex41hYCPiQ_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2929.55s">Name</a>  and address of the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2931.1s">DJ</a>  dabbing go for 70 high street West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2933.762s">I</a>  own dabs lock Thank you for councillor marks for bringing this up and councillor night for your suggestion on that I brought this actually up to Park Medford back in January when we were initially talking about this I stood at this podium and asked why the work couldn't be done at night what they were going to do about parking and I asked when I was giving over my hundred dollars for the parking permit I said is there gonna be any kind of leeway given where they're gonna be shutting our lot down for probably a close to a quarter of the year <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2959.727s">So</a>  we should be getting a quarter of that money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2962.088s">I</a>  mean, as business owners, you know, we already spend in taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2964.99s">We</a>  already spend for utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2966.271s">Now</a>  we have to spend for an unguaranteed parking spot, which now for upwards of 30 days, we're just going to be at our own mercy to try to hopefully get a spot on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2975.796s">So,</a>  and then the other issue is the bus stop being moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2979.238s">It's</a>  a great thing, but I think it should be permanently over in front of the bank where it's more ADA and compliant accessible by wheelchairs, people on crutches. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2987.331s">where</a>  it's not so much in front of the liquor store, because the next project they're going to do after the parking lot is they're going to be putting curb bump outs there to narrow high street to increase pedestrian safety, traffic flow kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=2999.943s">And</a>  when talking with the city engineer, I said, if you put the bump out where you're putting it, and the bus now has to go around it to get into the bus stop, now you're gonna have the buses back in, sticking onto High Street, thus causing more traffic jams than there already are on High Street during the rush hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3015.193s">So</a>  I think a permanent solution is permanently putting the bus down in front of Brookline Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3019.276s">They</a>  have their own small parking lot behind the bank for their customers, and I think it's a way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3025.687s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3026.487s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3026.787s">I</a>  think there is a proposal to maybe take some, uh, use some land down a place to the park, uh, which has been proposed also.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3175.852s">I</a>  don't think we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3176.672s">I</a>  don't think anyone's talked to Brookline Bank yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3178.274s">They</a>  do have a parking lot on the rail.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3179.895s">They</a>  have a parking lot on the rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3180.756s">Okay,</a>  so they're not losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3182.457s">What</a>  are they losing? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3183.357s">They're</a>  not losing any spots.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3184.497s">If</a>  we know it's a city parking, how many spots will we lose? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3188.818s">Probably</a>  two, maybe three. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3191.479s">Uh,</a>  I know there's a mailbox there that might have to be moved.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3195.62s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3198.96s">Vice</a>  president amongst the benefit is that we're picking up the spots more in the heart of the square where this is a little further out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3204.942s">So</a>  it accommodates more business where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3206.742s">So,</a>  uh, that's, that's what we're hoping to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3208.983s">And</a>  eventually I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3210.003s">I</a>  think, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3211.13s">as</a>  my colleagues agree, we'd like to see it permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3213.552s">And</a>  this may be a great way of just getting it in and then saying it's been working, it's successful, and let's stick with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3220.698s">Mr.</a>  President, I just want to thank the businesses for showing up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3223.159s">You</a>  know, it's amazing when you sit down with business owners and people in the community what great suggestions you can get, Mr. President, and move forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3232.146s">And</a>  I just want to thank the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3234.028s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3234.909s">And</a>  if I may, through the chair, with regards to everything that's been discussed tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3240.952s">I</a>  hear there's a lot of proposals out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3243.533s">I</a>  know this is starting fairly quickly, and there are a lot of concerns from the business owners down in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3250.737s">So</a>  when will these proposals be more set in stone so that the business owners can comment and maybe make additional suggestions and recommendations to alleviate some concerns? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3261.262s">Because</a>  as a business owner, I would not want to be put out like this for 30 days, 40 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3267.293s">So</a>  just through the chair, if I could recommend that the mayor's office work with the business owners, maybe whether that be another meeting once their proposals are, you know, kind of set in stone so that we can make sure everybody's happy and we can do whatever we can for the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3282.482s">This</a>  is just one step in the many that probably need to be done in the next couple months, but whatever we have to do, we want to make sure that the doors stay open and moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3290.967s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3292.168s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3293.681s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3294.741s">I'm</a>  wondering if maybe someone in the business community can answer this question for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3297.442s">But</a>  we also have a bus stop on the corner of Warren coming, I guess that would be West, into West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3304.565s">And</a>  we have a bus stop at the corner of Placedead Road at Irving Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3309.126s">Have</a>  those also been looked at as potential bus stops to move further away from the square to create some more parking on the opposite side of the street?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3319.049s">The</a>  only other, there's a spot on Warren and High.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3322.576s">The</a>  bus stop right in front of the spa.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3324.499s">That's</a>  the only other spot.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3326.081s">And</a>  then there's a bus stop on the corner of Irving Street in place of the road.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3329.265s">But</a>  I think that's got to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3331.088s">There's</a>  nowhere else to go over there.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3332.369s">And</a>  even if they move it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3333.351s">Nowhere</a>  to move there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3334.432s">But</a>  I think the proposal was to talk to the park commission and <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3338.935s">take</a>  that small section of Placid Park where they... Well, I'm aware what the proposal is. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3343.338s">The</a>  question is whether or not those locations have been examined.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3346.26s">So</a>  hopefully that'll be an area... If I can amend the paper to request that those two locations be examined, the corner of High Street and Warren Street and the corner of Placid Road and Irving Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3356.447s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3425.583s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3426.664s">There's</a>  portions of Mitchell Ave that you can actually see the dirt pavement, and it's about time the city moves forward on repaving Mitchell Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3437.632s">I</a>  also want to bring up on Salem Street, which I've brought up in the past, you can see the old railroad tracks coming through the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3445.578s">And</a>  on Riverside Ave, the same thing, not too far from the fire station on Riverside Ave, you can see the old railroad tracks <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3453.163s">appearing</a>  through the road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3455.044s">So</a>  I'd ask that Mitchell Ave be resurfaced in the interest of public safety, and that Salem Street and Riverside Ave be looked at for the railroad tracks that need to be covered up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3466.247s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3467.708s">Councilor</a>  Nice.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3469.068s">Mr.</a>  President, this is a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3470.729s">I</a>  think Mitchell Ave's been in rough shape since Testis was opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3474.79s">It's</a>  been long overdue that the street needs to be repaved, piggybacking on some of Councilor Mack's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3481.67s">Between</a>  route 16 at Winthrop street and south street, um, due to the detour that's in place with the closure of the credit bridge, we're seeing a increased volume and cars that are being detoured down to, um, the Winthrop street and south street, Winthrop to high and Winthrop to self. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3498.893s">Um,</a>  and in front of the baseball park, we're seeing the field fall apart, the street fall apart as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3503.294s">And</a>  we're seeing the exposed red rip rock like we're seeing on Evan street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3506.894s">Um,</a>  and we know that that's not something that we can just patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3510.483s">I</a>  think this is something that may require a little bit of help from our friends at the state delegation in relation to the Craddock Bridge project and the request that we made last week for mitigation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3520.285s">So</a>  I'd ask that this matter be put on a B paper and request that we receive some help in repaving and resurfacing the roadway between Route 16 and South Street as a result of the increased traffic volume on the roadway due to the detour that's in place because of the ramp closure. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3538.889s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3560.253s">Through</a>  the chair, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3561.793s">If</a>  we could also, while we're at it, I know this is a good time if we're going to talk about streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3567.356s">South</a>  Street's been brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3568.836s">We</a>  did, I believe, talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3571.3s">traffic</a>  calming approaches on that, getting a lot of Mack trucks driving down South, especially since they're deterred from driving down Harvard now, and they're banging potholes, shaking homes, keeping people up at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3585.506s">I've</a>  got multiple complaints on the speed on South Street, so we did discuss this months ago with regards to working to curve the speeding somehow, whether it be the speed monitoring signs, speed bumps, something needs to be done on South Street because <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3600.781s">It's</a>  really disrupting peace and enjoyment of the residents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3605.025s">So</a>  if we could add this to the agenda as well.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3607.648s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Locker. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3609.049s">And</a>  if I could add something to that paper, if we could ask why the raised crosswalk on Boston Avenue where Tufts was doing construction was taken down by the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3622.883s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3623.95s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, I actually had a conversation with Commissioner Kerins before the Committee of the Whole today, and he informed me that Paris Street would be going underneath, I'm sorry, Evans Street, not Paris Street, would have the ground broken in the next two weeks for that project to start up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3640.905s">So</a>  I'm looking forward to seeing that happen to answer Councilor Scarpelli's question. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3644.368s">And</a>  also on your question, I spoke with Rocco DiRico from- I spoke with Rocco myself today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3650.201s">Tufts</a>  University relative to the speed bump and that was a temporary speed bump that was put up during the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3654.864s">The</a>  construction is nearing an end so they've taken the temporary speed bump down and they're going to move forward with striping and safety markers and so on.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3662.288s">We're</a>  always fighting for raised crosswalks and we had one there that they put in for free and we took it away. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3670.092s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Caraviello-Viello, Councilor Lococoon, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3680.393s">Councilor</a>  Naye. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3681.254s">Councilor</a>  Haynes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3687.299s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3692.803s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3733.48s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3734.24s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3736.195s">I</a>  offer this resolution tonight, Mr. President, to hopefully go back and have the city solicitor look into a resolution that was offered by this council and debated back in 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3752.487s">And</a>  the reason why I offer this resolution is, Mr. President, there's a proposal by a company called In Motion Wireless and Corp. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3761.854s">And</a>  they just actually put, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3765.521s">an</a>  announcement in the transcript recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3768.822s">It</a>  appeared in the April 20th edition of the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3773.063s">There</a>  was a legal notice, and the legal notice stated that they were going to erect two 70-foot cell phone towers, proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3783.187s">And</a>  when I saw the addresses, I said, you gotta be kidding me. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3787.308s">The</a>  first address, Mr. President, was 63 Tyler Ave, which we all know is a residential area that abuts train tracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3795.032s">and</a>  also 59 Charnwood Road, which is another residential area that abuts train tracks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3803.054s">Both</a>  towers would be located in smack dab in neighborhoods and, in my opinion, would create a major visual impact in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3817.46s">Um,</a>  currently in, uh, there was no city ordinance that governs the placement of cell phone towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3824.624s">The</a>  current ordinance only regulates TV and radio antennas. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3830.167s">And</a>  it was back in 2008, believe it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3833.753s">I</a>  offered a resolution, paper 08-510, that would put into our city ordinance cell phone towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3844.502s">And</a>  what it would do is it would prohibit cell phone towers in residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3851.308s">And</a>  I'll talk about that a little bit later on, but that paper went through a lot of debate back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3858.354s">National</a>  Grid spoke on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3860.278s">The</a>  paper was sent to the office of community development, which all, um, um, ordinances need to be sent to dealing with, uh, zoning and, um, the paper trail kind of dies off after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3875.004s">But,</a>  um, the reason why I offer this tonight, Mr. President is as I stated, um, there is no, uh, ordinance right now that, um, that prohibits towers in residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3888.507s">And</a>  there was a resolution to amend ordinances only allowing cell towers in industrial and commercial zones and also by special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3897.389s">Uh,</a>  the matter was tabled by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3899.75s">Uh,</a>  when a representative from national grid raised an issue that was, um, at least two, um, state statutes allow wireless communication companies to attach antennas and amplifiers on utility poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3914.801s">And</a>  at the time we were prohibiting, um, any, uh, cell towers, uh, within neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3920.943s">And</a>  they said that, uh, was in direct, um, conflict with state statute, which allows these utility companies to put them on top of telephone poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3931.627s">Needless</a>  to say, this is not the request that was put in the transcript recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3937.369s">Um,</a>  I'm asking tonight, Mr. President, that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3942.695s">This</a>  paper be looked at by the city solicitor, uh, Mark Rumley and the building commissioner and provide, uh, the input that the community development board already gave us and the input language that national grid gave us, uh, which came out with, I believe was a great city ordinance back in 2011, uh, that would address, uh, the issue of erecting telephone, um, cell phone towers in residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3972.213s">And</a>  so that's my first motion that the city solicitor and the building commissioner look into the 2011 city ordinance draft that was proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=3984.638s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, the legal notice that was posted deals strictly with locating a cell tower near an historical preservation, national historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4000.661s">And</a>  it's the acts of 1966 and the 2005 nationwide programmatic agreement, uh, that allows for public comment when you're putting a cell phone tower within a half mile of a historic, uh, preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4018.672s">Um,</a>  and they're looking for input right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4023.295s">And</a>  I would ask the city solicitor, uh, what legal, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4030.06s">Maneuvers</a>  can be done to, first of all, look at the Royal House, which is probably within, I'd say, a half a mile or very close to Charnwood Road, to see if there's anything we can do on possibly putting a halt to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4048.25s">And</a>  secondly, Mr. President, it's vital now that we act. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4054.794s">I</a>  had some people come to me and say, well, there's a lot of areas in the city where <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4060.178s">uh,</a>  they're considered dead zones and you can't get a cell phone connections and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4065.261s">Um,</a>  that may not even be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4067.143s">These</a>  may not even be phone cell towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4069.704s">They</a>  may be cell towers for use of, uh, the railways. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4074.287s">And,</a>  um, I don't have that information, but I know that a city solicitor Romley did reach out to the attorneys that were on the notice I received, uh, just tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4089.21s">uh,</a>  from the federal communication commission, Washington DC, it's called information notice of section one Oh six filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4097.234s">They</a>  list both addresses and who the petitioner is, is for both in the consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4105.358s">Uh,</a>  and I think, uh, solicitor Romley reached out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4108.24s">I'm</a>  not sure if he got a response, but I would ask at this time, if the city solicitor can get up, Mr. President, he was involved in 2011, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4117.232s">uh,</a>  crafting the language and working on this with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4120.595s">And,</a>  uh, I'd like to hear from him. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4122.276s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4195.084s">And</a>  honestly, I didn't know anything more than those two simple notices. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4199.465s">So,</a>  I called the consultant who are in Wisconsin this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4203.166s">They</a>  called me back this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4205.487s">And</a>  this notification under chapter, under 106, which is a federal regulation, begins a comment period during which time a municipality, in this case, could comment on this particular proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4219.071s">And</a>  it is, as Councilor Marks had stated, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4221.926s">to</a>  put up these two towers at this particular address. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4225.088s">Now,</a>  the consultants were hired, of course, and they were hired by the entity that's serving the MTA, MBTA, excuse me, for these two towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4235.176s">Because</a>  ostensibly, the use of the towers would be to serve the ridership on the trains. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4240.539s">It</a>  may not simply be a cell tower like servicing our cell phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4245.463s">It</a>  could be to provide Wi-Fi services to the people on the train. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4252.1s">And</a>  it is for the MBTA that this was planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4255.542s">So</a>  the person on the other end was very informative, a very professional gentleman named Andrew Rice. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4261.946s">And</a>  I said, is this going to service the MBTA only? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4265.188s">Because</a>  I wanted to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4266.929s">And</a>  he said, well, yes, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4269.01s">Well,</a>  of course, over the years, we all learned a little bit about cell towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4272.402s">And</a>  a cell tower is not necessarily just for the one use, which is on that tower, because there's a whole industry, a billion dollar industry in cell towers, where the spots on that tower are sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4284.412s">So</a>  I asked Mr. Rice today, is it the intention of the MBTA to sell any other spaces on this tower, on these towers, if they build them for commercial use? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4294.4s">And</a>  the reason that I asked that is, Mr. Rice indicated, well, for many purposes, although he didn't enumerate the purposes, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4302.136s">For</a>  many purposes, the MBTA is exempt from local rule, and there's something to say about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4308.139s">There</a>  is some validity to that, depending upon the use. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4311.48s">But</a>  I said, if you're going to sell or you're going to rent out any of the spots on that tower, then you're not just simply using it for MBTA uses, you're using it for commercial uses, for a for-profit use, and that brings things out of many areas of exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4326.946s">Now,</a>  of course, that's the first time we talked about it, so there's a little bit of, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4331.546s">I</a>  would say silence for a few seconds after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4333.648s">I</a>  was just lifted at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4335.269s">So,</a>  the second thing is, when this notice went in the transcript, that began what under 106 is a 30-day comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4345.416s">A</a>  30-day comment period for everyone to send in their sentiments, concerns, and questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4351.06s">Now,</a>  I believe that the direct communication to the city was sent to the city clerk, the historic commission, I believe, and also it said generically the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4362.12s">Well,</a>  we can all say it was sent to the city of Medford, but you need to have a little bit of meat on the bones when you use that particular term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4369.745s">So</a>  to make sure the city of Medford received it, I asked Mr. Rice to send me the full packet this afternoon, which he did by email. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4377.269s">And</a>  I flipped it out to nine or 10 department heads and I shared it with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4383.173s">But</a>  I think you might've had it anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4384.733s">I</a>  didn't know, but I wanted to make sure that you had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4387.575s">So</a>  where does that leave us? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4389.677s">That</a>  leaves us, one, with an ordinance that probably needs a little bit of shaping and a little bit of polish for present day, which is a good idea anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4397.582s">Should</a>  look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4398.883s">And</a>  two, it puts us smack dab in the middle of a comment period where the city, its departments, its executive branch, and all other entities that have been notified should give their concern into the FCC under this notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4415.915s">Third,</a>  it puts us in the position of examining what the exact use would be by the MBTA and whether or not, if they do have any exemptions, whether or not those exemptions are waived or in any other way altered because of any intended commercial use of the cell tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4432.768s">Finally,</a>  if the ordinance which was not passed a few years back is enacted in some way, shape, or form right now, then the question could be, and there is no definitive answer to this, what effect <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4444.55s">a</a>  newly passed ordinance would be on this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4448.791s">Because</a>  the effective date or the notice date for the world, for the general public, so to speak, and you should always keep this in mind with a zoning enactment, is the date of publication before the planning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4464.456s">For</a>  example, about 20 years ago or 25 years ago, there was a moratorium put in place for certain uses in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4472.402s">that</a>  became effective when it was advertised before the planning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4476.204s">So</a>  if this ordinance went forth and was advertised before the planning board, that may well have some effect on this particular project, but that also would beg some other questions, like what exactly will the MBTA be using this tower for outside of serving its ridership? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4493.195s">I</a>  know that sounds like a lot, but everything has to be broken down to its simplest elements, and we have to begin at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4500.808s">So</a>  the first domino to fall, and there are two concurrently, would be for the council to revive a look at that older ordinance that was proposed because procedurally it's not alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4514.856s">And</a>  secondly, for all of the entities in the city of Medford, the various departments, et cetera, to craft carefully their concerns and to submit them under this notice period. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4527.023s">And</a>  the very last thing I'd say before I yield to my good friend, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4531.267s">is</a>  that the purpose of this notice period is under the NEPA to make certain determinations as to historical uses in the area, which is why the Royal House is a pertinent, in its distance away from this particular proposed cell tower, is pertinent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4552.281s">And</a>  that comes up under the National Environmental Policy Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4556.564s">So</a>  there are the various elements of this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4559.839s">and</a>  the various nuances that were presented with.</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4562.3s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4567.643s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4569.204s">Tom</a>  Lincoln. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4569.925s">I'm</a>  an executive director of the Royal House and Slave Quarters at 15 George Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4574.067s">I</a>  live at 27 Gleason Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4578.309s">I'd</a>  like to thank Councilor Marks and also the city solicitor and Ken Kraus, who actually brought this in front of <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4585.644s">some</a>  of us in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4587.166s">The</a>  Royal House and Slave Quarters, as we can best figure it, is about 2,000 feet away. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4592.753s">One</a>  thing that I think needs clarification, as I understand it, is that these are legal addresses, but the cell phone towers are actually proposed on the railroad right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4602.725s">I</a>  think you probably have to give the closest <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4605.507s">street</a>  address to there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4607.668s">But</a>  that said, the Royal House and Slave Quarters is a National Historic Landmark, which is the highest category of historic sites right here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4618.153s">We</a>  certainly preceded these cell phones by about 287 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4624.461s">And</a>  we're concerned, as I've talked to some of my colleagues and people on the board at the Royal House and Slave Quarters, about the visual impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4633.024s">74</a>  feet, I'm not an expert on visual impacts, but 74 feet is 65, 75, 74 feet, whatever it is, is pretty high. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4641.967s">I</a>  think it's higher than any building in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4644.648s">It's</a>  certainly higher than our, than the 1737 house that we have, as well as the Slave Quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4653.133s">It's</a>  also not clear, and I think it will be good to know, exactly what the consequences are of commenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4660.195s">If</a>  it's just a comment period just to gather information, and if you don't have any statutory rights, et cetera, I'm not sure how much good that would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4672.46s">So</a>  we're certainly, at the Royal House of Slave Quarters, are concerned about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4676.601s">We're</a>  certainly going to comment, along with the city departments, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4683.032s">One</a>  thing, if you haven't been on a tour at the Royal House Slave Quarters recently, one thing we try to convey with our one acre left of 500 historic acres is the extent of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4694.721s">And</a>  so we do talk about the surrounding landscape and people certainly get a view of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4700.685s">And</a>  I'm trying to imagine what it might look like with the cell phone tower sticking up above every other house off of George Street and back in that adjacent neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4712.5s">The</a>  second place, which I wear several hats here, but the second place which may be affected, though I think visually may be not affected, is the Brooks Estate, which I believe is about a half a mile from the Tyler Avenue location. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4729.464s">63,</a>  is it 63 Tyler? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4732.925s">Is</a>  very close to Grove Street, up on the north end of Tyler there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4741.125s">The</a>  last point I would make, and I think this is certainly in the back of people's minds, if there are two towers being proposed today, what's in the future here? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4752.114s">There</a>  are clearly some interesting and perhaps difficult jurisdictional issues in terms of the MBTA, et cetera, but the demand for bandwidth, as I understand it, the demand for services is certainly not going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4770.897s">Going</a>  back to the cell phone side, there are certainly dead spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4773.779s">In</a>  fact, the royal house, if you're inside the royal house, it's very hard to get cell phone service for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4780.925s">And</a>  I think that precedent is a thing to worry about here in terms of. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4786.81s">And</a>  these are really, any way you look at it, these are really tall structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4794.236s">In</a>  the past, in fact, this has happened in West Bedford, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4797.611s">cell</a>  phone transmitters, or whatever they are, or amplifiers, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4801.573s">Cell</a>  phone service have been placed atop buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4804.054s">They've</a>  been disguised. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4806.135s">There's</a>  no disguising these towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4808.656s">So</a>  we look forward to learning more about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4812.957s">And</a>  we look forward both to an effective ordinance and to a resolution of some of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4819.54s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4823.802s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4825.303s">Name</a>  and address of the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4827.58s">Doug</a>  Carr, 124 Boston Avenue in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4830.863s">I,</a>  like Mr. Lincoln, I wear several hats here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4833.585s">I'm</a>  on the Medford Historic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4836.507s">I'm</a>  a director of the Brooks City Land Trust, and I've also served as the former chair of the Green Line Extension Design Working Group, which is currently dormant, but this is affected by the Green Line because of the property on Charnwood, which is directly abuts the <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4852.605s">future</a>  Green Line extension to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4855.466s">I</a>  want to echo what was said before. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4856.827s">I</a>  think there's a, these are insanely large, very disruptive visually. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4862.729s">They</a>  lower property values, frankly, for anyone within sight of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4866.131s">Certainly</a>  the backyards of the people along Charnwood are not going to be enhanced by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4871.773s">On</a>  the Medford Historic Commission, we have reviewed at least a half a dozen soap tower proposals in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4879.737s">They've</a>  all been <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4881.587s">penthouses.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4882.308s">They've</a>  all been on the sides of buildings, buried amongst mechanical equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4886.47s">They've</a>  never been freestanding because it's insane to even propose that in a dense city like the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4892.473s">It's</a>  too disruptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4893.914s">We've</a>  approved them because, well, we didn't actually approve them, but we commented on them, and we sometimes were able to guide them on things like paint colors or maybe shifting their location to be less visually intrusive, but we <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4906.792s">They've</a>  always been rather intelligently proposed, and these are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4910.234s">These</a>  are obviously in smack dab in the navel of the West Medford and the Hillside neighborhoods, and they're going to cause immeasurable damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4917.598s">So</a>  there are plenty of buildings that are about 70 feet tall, all along the railway, not far from these locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4925.182s">We</a>  just need to push them a little bit to come up with a better design rather than the plain, simple drop. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4929.724s">It's</a>  75 feet to the top of equipment is what the drawings say that we all received today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4935.705s">Basically</a>  go back to the drawing board and try again. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4937.867s">Try</a>  a better way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4939.509s">Think</a>  of the Cummings building on Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4941.271s">The</a>  U-Haul building. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4942.492s">Think</a>  of several buildings along Tufts not too far from Charnwood. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4946.696s">Those</a>  are perfectly logical places we could put these towers and nobody would ever see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4951.882s">We</a>  just need to work better and start a dialogue but tell them this is simply unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4958.205s">I</a>  mean, the Grove Street slave wall is probably within 700 feet of the one in Playstead. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4963.028s">This</a>  will be looming over the ball fields on Playstead. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4965.73s">I</a>  believe the royal house is within, I know the Brooks Estate, at least a portion with the ponds is within that half mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4970.533s">So</a>  there's clearly some historic resources that the documents say there's no negative effect on in the 33-page document you all received today, which is simply not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4981.859s">So</a>  we just need to basically pause <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4984.851s">and</a>  come up with a better solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4986.012s">I'm</a>  convinced there is a good one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4987.632s">We</a>  don't need to reinvent the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4989.873s">They</a>  should not be putting these in residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4991.654s">We</a>  do need to revise our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4993.035s">I</a>  completely agree with the council on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4995.056s">And</a>  I look forward to helping that make, make that occur in the very near future.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=4999.918s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5004.02s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5005.941s">I</a>  know that back in the day when this resolution that Councilor Marks talking about was directly involved in the field of dreams committee and <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5014.928s">One</a>  of the biggest issues we had was that cell phone tower and the operation being built behind the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5022.95s">And</a>  one of the biggest benefits for that American cell phone tower company at the time was how quickly and how much money they would make off of selling parts of that tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5032.332s">What</a>  would be interesting to me is to see where else on the line that the T would be looking to put other towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5040.794s">Because</a>  if you can, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5042.872s">would</a>  be a direct correlation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5044.032s">If</a>  you see it just, you know, not just Medford, but you see it down the line, I think it might help us in really understanding that they're using, I mean, let's all, you know, state the facts, the T's in huge financial difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5059.515s">So</a>  I'd like to see that maybe if there's a way to ask them in our conversations, are we just looking in Medford or are they looking all the way down the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5068.237s">Because</a>  if I think they, if they are doing that, <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5071.501s">I</a>  think this would be just a clear punch in the face that shows that they're using this for a revenue stream rather than what might be just discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5082.728s">So</a>  that'd be interesting to see if we can reach out and ask that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5089.673s">If</a>  it's just Medford, are they putting those towers elsewhere? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5092.995s">It</a>  would be an interesting information. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5095.877s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5096.537s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scott.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5099.559s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5101.755s">Just</a>  if I could, in addition to what was mentioned about the legal notice, uh, regarding, uh, the public input, uh, on a national registered or historic places. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5112.001s">Um,</a>  I did speak to Paul Moki, the building commissioner, and he stated that the only requirement that he is aware of as building commissioner, if someone wants to erect a cell phone tower, it's a building permit and an electrical permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5127.391s">There's</a>  no others, no special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5129.943s">There's</a>  no other hoops that you have to jump through. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5133.204s">And</a>  there may be a question regarding zoning setbacks, and that's something that's being looked at currently right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5140.866s">So</a>  at this point, Mr. President, I would ask that the original paper, 11-477, be sent to Solicitor Rumley, and that is the paper that includes <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5158.134s">The</a>  recommendations from the community development board, which recommended that wireless towers only be constructed in the two most industrial zoning districts in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5171.923s">And</a>  that also the board recommended the city council be the granting authority for special permits for towers in those zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5179.508s">So</a>  those were the two recommendations that came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5182.09s">National</a>  grid also to be in compliance with the two state statutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5186.997s">a</a>  recommended language that would still allow them to put cell towers on their telephone poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5193.578s">And</a>  I won't speak for the city solicitor, but I think that's something that we're obligated to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5198.959s">We</a>  want to adhere to whatever state statute is. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5202.34s">And</a>  this paper, Mr. President, I believe addresses all those concerns and it's a combination of all that input. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5209.641s">I</a>  would also ask that my paper be referred to the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5215.342s">So</a>  paper 17 dash <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5217.575s">417</a>  be referred to the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5220.197s">Once</a>  we get a response back from the city solicitor on paper 11-477 on the language, we can meet in the Committee of the Whole and hopefully we can push this ordinance through after three readings, Mr. President, and give the neighborhood the safeguards and the peace of mind that they deserve that these towers won't be popping up, Mr. President, in places that they're not welcomed.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5832.295s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5833.655s">I</a>  just want to thank Councilman Lai for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5836.676s">I</a>  thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5838.256s">Riccio</a>  for all the work she's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5839.857s">It</a>  goes to show how much she has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5843.938s">When</a>  you have parents calling you upset that a director is leaving, so it goes to show all the hard work that she's put into the program, which she explained to us in part a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5856.29s">she</a>  really impressed me before the council that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5859.151s">And</a>  then a week later she is now leaving, but I wish her the best of luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5863.352s">And</a>  I hope that we are able to find somebody as enthusiastic and hardworking as her to keep the programs alive and going strong and create more opportunities for our, our young, uh, younger generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5874.795s">So</a>  I want to thank her for that and, and hope that we can fill her shoes to the best of our ability.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5881.637s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5881.977s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5882.677s">Councilor</a>  Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5883.843s">Again,</a>  to that point, again, Mr. President, I know I forgot, but I wanted to make sure that when I talked to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5888.605s">Riccio,</a>  one of the things she was so proud of was the fact that when we as a school committee years ago looked for a new director, I believe we classified the three finalists as used car salesmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5903.79s">And</a>  then coming across Heidi Riccio, what she mentioned to me that <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5910.94s">Four</a>  years ago, method wasn't even in the world of vocational education, wasn't even on the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5919.344s">And</a>  the interest gathered already from phone calls that vocational experts have been contacting her to apply for this job is astonishing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5931.81s">So</a>  I can't wait to see what happens, but I know she's definitely <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5937.59s">helping</a>  with that piece, moving it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5940.272s">So</a>  I want to let our parents know that it's definitely different than it was four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5945.817s">There'll</a>  be a line at the superintendent's door waiting to pass in their resumes for an opportunity to be the director of that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=5954.524s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

And I guess for that reason, Circle the Square will only have one date this year, which I'm not sure why they can't use other parts of the square, but that's the notice that went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6694.747s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, if I could,</p>

    <p>[mex41hYCPiQ_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6855.926s">Yes,</a>  Pinky's Pizza and Helen's Roast Beef. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6860.369s">And</a>  I went out to speak to them and welcomed them to Medford and I was so happy some of these are in my neighborhood and I'd be happy when they're opening up and the places aren't empty anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6870.423s">And</a>  I asked them about June 4th, if they would be interested in participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6873.784s">And</a>  they didn't even know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6874.965s">And</a>  they didn't know about the events that happen up at Tufts College, where they might be able to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6880.207s">And</a>  I just wonder if there's any way we could have some ambassadors to welcome these new businesses in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6886.189s">It's</a>  so wonderful to have them coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6887.889s">And</a>  we know what a risk it is for, especially young people or anybody, any age, to start a new business in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6894.312s">That</a>  would be you.</p>

    <p>[mex41hYCPiQ_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6897.378s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6899.519s">How</a>  about the high school kids? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6900.699s">I</a>  mean, this is a wonderful thing.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6902.0s">We</a>  have a chamber of commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6903.16s">There's</a>  Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6904.46s">There's</a>  multiple outlets for these people to, multiple resources for them to find out.</p>

    <p>[mex41hYCPiQ_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6910.402s">But</a>  they don't know about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6911.662s">And</a>  I think we need to reach out.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6913.083s">If</a>  they were good business people, they would know where to find them.</p>

    <p>[mex41hYCPiQ_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6915.403s">Well,</a>  we want them to be good business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6917.884s">So</a>  if we have to help educate them so they can have a successful business of Medford, I think it would be good to have some ambassadors to do that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6924.758s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6925.418s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6926.218s">Mr.</a>  President, motion to request that the administration examine the feasibility of allowing the senior citizen abatement program to work as ambassadors between new businesses in the community and city hall.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6936.042s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6936.402s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Delco. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6940.143s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6941.023s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6941.744s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6943.904s">The</a>  records were passed to Vice President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6949.146s">Mr.</a>  Vice President, how did you find those records?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6952.007s">Found</a>  them in moderate overpriced.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6953.868s">I</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6955.837s">seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6958.318s">Motion</a>  to adjourn by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6962.961s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/aTcx-mFr9SQ&t=6964.601s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>
