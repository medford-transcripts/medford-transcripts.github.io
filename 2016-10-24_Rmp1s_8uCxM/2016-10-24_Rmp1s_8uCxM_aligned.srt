00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:06,857
Hi, I'm Helen.

2
00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:07,998
Hi, I'm Lydia.

3
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:10,140
I'm Gabby.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,602
I'm Cheyenne.

5
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:14,704
I'm Amber.

6
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:16,926
Hey, I'm Will.

7
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,468
Hi, I'm Courtney.

8
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:20,930
I'm Sam.

9
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:23,372
I'm Dora the Reporter.

10
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:25,253
I'm Carrie Anne.

11
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:26,975
I'm Anthony.

12
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:28,987
Hi, I'm McKenzie.

13
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:30,748
Hello, I'm D.P.

14
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:32,588
Hi, I'm Nick.

15
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:39,269
Hi, I'm Nick Keniston with the Mustang Report for Faculty Friday, and I'm here with Michelle Foe, an Italian teacher at Medford High School.

16
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:41,230
Why did you decide to pursue teaching?

17
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,470
I think it was just something always a part of me.

18
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,610
My mom's a teacher.

19
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:51,372
I always would volunteer in her classes growing up, and I really just got accustomed to being in school and helping kids out.

20
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:52,352
I love

21
00:00:52,912 --> 00:01:05,003
seeing kids be successful and I love when they, you know, come to me with a concern for something or they need help and then they get to, you know, realize that they were successful after the fact.

22
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:11,890
So, kind of the whole progress of the evolution of the student, kind of from the problem through the whole thing.

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,712
That's really satisfying for the kid and also for me.

24
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:17,575
If you could be any animal in general, what would you be and why?

25
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:20,778
Thinking long and hard, I would say I'd be a bird.

26
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:27,021
I would like to be a bird because that way I could fly wherever I want at any time, especially like Italy.

27
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:34,684
Well, volleyball for me personally has been really awesome.

28
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:41,547
I made a ton of friends and it's just been a really great way to like kind of integrate in the school year because you start in the fall and it's a lot of fun.

29
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:47,304
We went 6-0 in the GBL and I feel like during states we should do pretty good.

30
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:48,566
The season went really well.

31
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,929
We had a lot of fun and the kids learned quite a bit.

32
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:57,479
We played a lot of difficult teams this year, high-ranked teams, and we really, really played well.

33
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:58,159
really good.

34
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:04,083
We have a bunch of new freshmen who are thinking about coming in and we have a lot of solid seniors who are going to play really well this year.

35
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:05,484
It's really easy.

36
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:07,045
You don't have to have any experience.

37
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:07,786
You can join.

38
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:10,447
You don't have to be someone who knows how to play.

39
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:14,950
It can be a first time and then you can just have fun and you can learn with the group as the season goes on.

40
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:17,872
Girls cross-country team is doing fantastic.

41
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:19,253
The season's going pretty great.

42
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:26,197
The boys team has done good as well and we're grateful that we have our coach Lou coaching for 35 years now.

43
00:02:27,678 --> 00:02:38,620
Last year we got our first win in about 10 years so that was really exciting and we hope to continue that this year and we have a new pool so there's a growing team and we're rebuilding so it should be a good year.

44
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:54,703
Well our season went really well last year and we had some great team chemistry we all had some really good times together we all made each other laugh we got along really well and for the upcoming season we hope to work on probably just improving our record because other than that we had a really great time with each other maybe just winning a couple more games and it'll be great.

45
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:58,930
I'll tell you right now, last year was a tough year for the Mustangs.

46
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,831
We actually expected a lot more.

47
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:02,872
But we're looking forward.

48
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:06,913
We're actually excited about the new league that we're going into this year, the Northeast Division.

49
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:08,714
A lot of good teams.

50
00:03:09,654 --> 00:03:10,935
So we're looking forward to that.

51
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:17,117
And we do have a great group of seniors coming back, upperclassmen, great underclassmen.

52
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:18,577
So we're looking forward to the 2016 season.

53
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:22,078
Last season went really well.

54
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:26,580
We had a lot of really good incoming freshmen that came up and really boosted the morale of the team.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,102
For me, I thought the group really worked well as a team and we were all really cohesive in that sense.

56
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:37,423
Mostly going from being a younger team to an older team, we should

57
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:40,625
Be good this year if everything goes as well.

58
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:57,836
Yeah, I'd like to point out that Makai is not just a member of the basketball team He's elected a captain as a junior Which is an honor to be as an under as someone who's not a senior to be elected captain by his by his teammates And we're looking to build you know like Makai said we were inexperienced last year and now we're experienced So we've set high expectations for us

59
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:01,915
So I was on JV for most of the season, but hearing about varsity, they did really well.

60
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,096
I got pulled up for states, and again, we did really well.

61
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:06,836
I think we did really good this season.

62
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:08,437
We all worked together well as a team.

63
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:13,658
And for next season, I think we just have to keep doing what we did last year and just win more games.

64
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:15,839
I think we did spectacular.

65
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:20,220
What would you say to any incoming freshmen that are thinking about joining gymnastics?

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,221
I think it's definitely worth it.

67
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:24,784
I didn't do it my freshman year and I regret it so much.

68
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:28,467
I did it my sophomore year and it's probably the best decision I made in high school.

69
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:30,168
We're doing pretty well at the moment.

70
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:32,610
Our record's currently nine, four, and three?

71
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:32,690
Two.

72
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:33,891
And two.

73
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:36,774
About joining next year, I really think you guys should join.

74
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:42,018
I feel like we're not just a team, we're a family and it's really great and you meet a lot of cool people.

75
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:44,881
I think it's a great way to make friends.

76
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:46,503
As she said, we're kind of family.

77
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:47,504
We're all close.

78
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:49,147
We all hang out on and off the field.

79
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:53,633
We're having fun, not only winning games, but just having fun together.

80
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:59,320
I think last season was definitely like a rebuilding season, and that it's just going to get better as time goes on.

81
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,722
Yeah, I have to agree.

82
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:04,385
I mean, we were just continuing to get better.

83
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:06,587
And yeah, the show should be pretty good.

84
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,009
We have a lot of new people coming in.

85
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,791
I'd say it's pretty awesome.

86
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:12,213
I mean, I played on the team since I was in seventh grade.

87
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:15,477
And we're kind of one big family.

88
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:16,979
So that's how it works.

89
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:18,300
It's really good.

90
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,700
We've been working very hard.

91
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:25,244
We have our competition coming up in a couple weeks and we're excited.

92
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:27,225
We all want to improve on everything.

93
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:32,408
Everything's always an improvement like day by day so we all want to try to improve day by day.

94
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:34,990
Tumbling, stunts, jumps, everything.

95
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:44,596
It's really fun and it's a good experience to start off the school year when you're trying to find something to do and trying to make friends and you start school with friends so it's really good.

96
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:51,297
The question for the week is, what sports did I used to play?

97
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:06,663
We at Medford High School have come together through our sports teams and our school to help raise awareness for domestic violence.

98
00:06:07,343 --> 00:06:11,285
We at Medford High School stand in solidarity to join the fight against domestic violence.

99
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:17,087
We have invoked a responsibility in our student leaders to come together and spread awareness throughout our school.

100
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:18,408
No more.

101
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,210
We stand together.

102
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,030
No more!

103
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:25,552

No more violence!

106
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:35,697
No mas.

107
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,358
No more I don't want to talk about it.

108
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,659

Which one of us will it be?

128
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:26,615
No more!
