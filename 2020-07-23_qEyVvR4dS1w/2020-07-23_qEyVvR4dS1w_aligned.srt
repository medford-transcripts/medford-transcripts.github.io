1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:00,911
Thanks for being here.

2
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:07,174
This is Solidarity Live, where we discuss how COVID-19 is affecting Medford and Somerville.

3
00:00:08,094 --> 00:00:11,276
This show is really about getting through this crisis together.

4
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:23,841
So if you have been affected by COVID-19, if you have lost income, if you're worried about a family member in a hospital, in a nursing home, in a jail, if you're struggling with school closures or anything else, please reach out.

5
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:27,643
Good policy is based on hearing directly from people in need.

6
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:33,245
And this show is about uplifting those stories so that we can solve these problems together as a community.

7
00:00:34,126 --> 00:00:39,428
One example of how we are doing that is with the SNAP, a food assistance program.

8
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:52,174
Someone did reach out to the show a week or two ago to say that his doctor had told him that he needed to stay indoors because of his lung condition, but he cannot use his SNAP card to purchase groceries online.

9
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:54,475
He has to go to the grocery store in person.

10
00:00:55,355 --> 00:01:07,201
So we had an expert come on the show and give some advice, but it turns out that other states are allowing people to do online grocery delivery, and that is where you, viewers of the show, come in.

11
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:14,405
Please sign our petition to make Massachusetts one of the states that allows SNAP recipients to get their groceries delivered.

12
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:17,066
Together, we can help our neighbors through this crisis.

13
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:24,710
Our campaign is hearing directly from people in need, uplifting their voices, and engaging the community to solve these issues.

14
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:32,705
So today I have on Hannah O'Hanlon from the Somerville Homelessness Coalition.

15
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:37,407
She's going to talk about the homeless population here and how they're being affected.

16
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:47,130
Then we'll have David Tizell from the Somerville Community Corporation to talk about the tenants that they have and what they're doing to keep them in their homes.

17
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:57,266
And after that, we will have Movami Callahan, who's a Medford doctor, and she will be talking about how our medical system is holding up under the stress of COVID-19.

18
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:00,666
So I will go ahead and get us started here.

19
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:05,647
I'm gonna bring in Hannah O'Hanlon.

20
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:12,709
I just have to get her on the screen.

21
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:13,669
Oh, there we go.

22
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:18,109
I...

23
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:21,854
There we go.

24
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:24,955
I have managed to find the right button.

25
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:39,645
And by the way, anyone who is watching on YouTube, you can simply comment in YouTube's comment box and then ask any question you like and I can pull that question in and we'll answer those questions live.

26
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:41,546
So, great.

27
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:44,127
Hannah, thank you so much for being here.

28
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:48,110
I would love to hear a little bit just about your organization in general and the work that you do.

29
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:52,488
Yeah, you know, thank you so much for having me.

30
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:54,148
First of all, I really appreciate it.

31
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:58,749
So like you said, I work for the Somerville Homeless Coalition.

32
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:04,571
It's a really small nonprofit in Somerville, but we serve a lot of people.

33
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:09,452
We serve, you know, pretty much all greater Boston.

34
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:11,892
We're part of what's called the balance of state.

35
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:14,093
So we're not really just stuck to Somerville.

36
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,994
We do take a regional approach to serving people experiencing homelessness.

37
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,775
as well as people on the brink of homelessness.

38
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:27,178
So my particular role there is called the emergency services program manager.

39
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:31,481
So I kind of have two focuses.

40
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:40,226
My main one is to supervise and kind of control the daily operations of our two shelters.

41
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:45,950
So we have an individual shelter and a state funded family shelter.

42
00:03:46,843 --> 00:04:03,388
And then the second part of my job is to oversee our street outreach program, where we're going out into encampments in the area, hitting the streets where people are sleeping at night, kind of the most vulnerable homeless people that we see, and really trying to engage with them.

43
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:06,709
So that's what I do.

44
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:09,189
That is great.

45
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:10,450
Really needed work.

46
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:21,924
Do you have an idea of how many folks you interact with as a homeless population in need, like on a daily or weekly basis?

47
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:34,315
So our individual shelter alone services 16 people, and our family shelter holds five families at a time, a maximum of 20 people.

48
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:47,523
At a given time, like I did street outreach today and I would say we probably saw 15 people out in encampment and then probably another maybe 5 to 10 people sitting in Davis Square.

49
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:58,885
Separate from that, we also provide what's called permanent supportive housing, which is when we go out and we rent apartments, take people out of homelessness and put them in those apartments.

50
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:04,669
So through that program, we lease up over 60 units and house probably over 100 people.

51
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:05,449
That's amazing.

52
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:13,035
And then, yeah, we also have our food pantry that on an average month, we see probably 300 to 400 people.

53
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:16,517
Currently, we're definitely seeing that number kind of double.

54
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:22,001
So it really all depends on the program as far as how many people we see.

55
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:22,902
Yeah.

56
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:24,443
And where does your funding come from?

57
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:29,076
Oh, kind of everywhere, honestly.

58
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:33,898
Our family shelter is primarily funded through DHCD.

59
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,960
The state, our adult shelter has city funding, has state funding.

60
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:40,453
the federal government.

61
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,555
A lot of our homelessness prevention comes from the city of Somerville.

62
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:49,857
We just kind of pieced together a lot of different funding sources to make sure we can stay open.

63
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:51,959
And a lot of fundraising, that's for sure.

64
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:59,322
We just did an online campaign where we raised, to the best of my knowledge, I think over $100,000, which was huge for us.

65
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:01,984
Yeah, that's amazing.

66
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:07,827
Can you talk about how COVID-19 is affecting the people that you're helping?

67
00:06:10,463 --> 00:06:14,907
You know, it's stressful, much like everybody else.

68
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:18,590
And again, it kind of divides up into the different sections.

69
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,794
Like our permanent supportive housing program, their services are now remote.

70
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:35,263
And it's really hard to provide case management to an 18-year-old in recovery and living on their own for the first time when it's just a phone call.

71
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:42,718
or our shelter now we're only, we've passed it at 13 right now, hoping to move out some more people.

72
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:48,600
That way we can lower the number even more because social distancing just does not exist in a homeless shelter.

73
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,180
It's real hard.

74
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,921
Our family shelter, the kids aren't in school.

75
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:56,101
So, you know, we're trying to engage them.

76
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,461
We're trying to educate them.

77
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:02,722
All of a sudden the direct care workers are now teachers just as much as parents are.

78
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,881
Yeah, it's definitely hard.

79
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:16,884
I think we're all tired, and we'll be grateful when it's over, but we're showing up every day.

80
00:07:16,964 --> 00:07:18,364
Our services remain open.

81
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:22,245
We're still street outreaching, which is great.

82
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:26,187
We have our masks on, we have our gloves on when we go out there, but

83
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:39,939
You know, today when I was in the woods, a lot of people that typically make their money off of hand handling aren't getting money because people aren't going to work or people are afraid to stick their hand out the car window and give money.

84
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,583
So people now are starving in the woods because they don't have any money to buy food.

85
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:48,565
So when we go out there, it is constantly like, do you have food today?

86
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:49,566
Do you have water?

87
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:51,207
You know, those basic needs that

88
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,051
normally aren't as dire, really are dire at this point.

89
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:05,032
So things that I never thought kind of would have come up, like money from panhandling, but we're definitely seeing a lot of it.

90
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,553
Wow.

91
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:14,014
What do you think is the best way for people to be able to help out?

92
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:16,414
Where can they donate?

93
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:17,635
Can they volunteer?

94
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:19,735
Are there other ways that they can help?

95
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:26,773
Yeah, I know our food pantry is taking volunteers and because they're getting absolutely swamped.

96
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:31,299
And I think it was the month of March, typically we see 300 people and it was over 800 people.

97
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:31,639
And, you know,

98
00:08:34,970 --> 00:09:00,177
Surrounding cities that have had to close their food pantries people are now coming to Somerville that typically, you know We don't service but we're not going to turn somebody away for food So we are you know, really looking for people to donate food to project seek our food pantry They can go they can help sort cans because we're just handing out bags of food at this point and we need to pack those bags and

99
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:03,954
As well as, you know, you can always go on the website and donate money.

100
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:09,516
Honestly, we're operating our shelter 24-7 right now, and that's not something we have funding for.

101
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:16,379
Typically, our shelter's only open 16 hours a day, and since the beginning of March, we've been open 24-7.

102
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,540
So, that's something that, you know, we need to find funding for.

103
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,421
And that's one way the community could help, that's for sure.

104
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:25,022
Absolutely.

105
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:32,859
Do you have any final thoughts, anything else that you want people to know about what's happening?

106
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:54,955
Oh, you know, I heard on WBUR there was a segment on homeless shelters, and all I remember is hearing that they had gotten enough tests to test an entire homeless shelter, like every single person in the shelter, and that some crazy high percentage of them

107
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,381
One in three.

108
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:01,404
Yeah, that's what I remember, but I didn't want to quote it because it seems so high.

109
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:06,548
But a lot of them were asymptomatic and they didn't show signs of the disease.

110
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:08,870
What do you think that that means?

111
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:17,957
You know, I think it's hard because we've really heard when it comes to, you know, the shelters, we need three things.

112
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:21,520
We need depopulation, we need quarantine, and we need isolation.

113
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:21,600
And

114
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:32,640
I feel like this is always an issue with homelessness is, is it going to be a state response, is it going to be a regional response, a federal response, or a local response?

115
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,542
And I've never seen that more present than I do right now.

116
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:37,004
You know, how are we going to respond?

117
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:38,065
Is it going to be the city?

118
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,086
Is it going to be the state?

119
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:40,167
Is it going to be regional?

120
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:47,673
And so as we kind of sort that out, you know, things start, people get symptomatic, people get sick.

121
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:51,056
It hit Boston hard.

122
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,758
It hit the Boston shelters really hard, one in three.

123
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:56,539
And now it's starting to make its way over the river.

124
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,822
It's going to hit Cambridge, and then it's going to slowly progress.

125
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:14,351
So the more we can do to get ahead of it and depopulate our shelters and set up those quarantine sites is going to really make the difference from Boston to the city of Somerville and Medford and the surrounding areas.

126
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,960
Yeah, absolutely.

127
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,462
And so it sounds like the program that you have where you actually house people is the safest for them.

128
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:23,303
Correct.

129
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:27,184
In addition to being obviously the best for them.

130
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:31,625
When you can house people and they can have their own home, it's clearly better for many reasons.

131
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:34,406
But here in COVID-19, it's even more crucial.

132
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:36,087
Exactly.

133
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:43,009
It's really showing kind of the holes in the system and what really will make the difference for homelessness in the future, which

134
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:45,249
in reality will always be housing.

135
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,482
It will always be what makes the difference for someone experiencing homelessness.

136
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:52,577
Well, thank you so much.

137
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:55,358
The work you guys do is totally amazing.

138
00:11:56,979 --> 00:12:01,901
And I don't envy you the amount of work that you have to do these days.

139
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:08,023
So, you know, we will be encouraging people to help you out, to volunteer and donate.

140
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,084
Thank you so much.

141
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:12,625
Yeah, it's really good to have an update.

142
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:14,826
And stay safe.

143
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:20,288
do personal care, everything that you need to do.

144
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:22,238
And thank you so much.

145
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:24,007
Thank you.

146
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:24,610
I appreciate it.

147
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:24,972
Yeah.
