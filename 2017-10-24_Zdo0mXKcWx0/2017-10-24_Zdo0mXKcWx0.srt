[SPEAKER_01]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

8

[SPEAKER_01]: 17721, request for an expenditure from the law department.

00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:58,820

15
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:15,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, could you give us a brief description of this case?

16
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:20,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, so I'm here tonight, three requests for expenditures.

17
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:29,622
[SPEAKER_05]: This particular case involves Chapter 258 of the Massachusetts General Laws, also known as the Massachusetts Store Claims Act.

18
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:42,477
[SPEAKER_05]: The claimant in this case is requesting $4,633.18 as compensation for property damage done to his vehicle on January 1st, which involved a fire department vehicle.

19
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:46,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I received the appropriate paperwork from the claimant.

20
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:52,341
[SPEAKER_05]: The case was settled prior to trial, and I am here tonight respectfully requesting approval in that amount.

21
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:53,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

22
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:58,643
[SPEAKER_01]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

23
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:01,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll call has been requested.

24
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:01,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

25
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:02,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

26
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,250
[SPEAKER_04]: For in the affirmative three absent motion passes 17 7 2 2 because of the expenditure, a lot of the problems claims over $1,000.

27
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Mr. Presidents and members of the office, city council, Stephanie Burke, Patricia Dyer,

28
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:30,605
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the city of Medford.

29
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:37,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam Solicitor, could you please give us a brief synopsis of the case?

30
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:38,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, Mr. President.

31
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:44,859
[SPEAKER_05]: The claimant in this case, and by the way, this case involves chapter 84, also known as the street defect statute.

32
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:53,187
[SPEAKER_05]: The claimant in this case seeks compensation for injuries she suffered as a result of a uneven sidewalk panel on Grant Avenue.

33
00:02:54,312 --> 00:03:11,387
[SPEAKER_05]: As she, due to her fall, she suffered cuts to her hands, her mouth, she broke her dentures, fractured her nose, and because her medical expenses exceed $6,500, I am requesting $5,000, which is the cap under the statute tonight.

34
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:12,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

35
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:18,072
[SPEAKER_01]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, excuse me, name and address of the record, please.

36
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:24,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, um, on this address to the record, please.

37
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:26,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert Penta zero summit road, former member of this board.

38
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:32,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, whether it be this question or the next one, it is maybe the terminology is wrong.

39
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:38,560
[SPEAKER_03]: It says medical cost is 5,000, but in the narrative it says medical bills are in excess of 6,500.

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Could that be just explain why it's five and not 65 the next day about the next one is the same thing.

41
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:45,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

42
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:46,062
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

43
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:51,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Because $5,000 is the cap that you can recover under chapter 84 of the general laws.

44
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:54,664
[SPEAKER_05]: which also falls under this particular case and the next one as well.

45
00:03:55,224 --> 00:04:07,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the medical, although they were in excess of $65, the maximum amount that I can ask for from this council is 5,000, which is why I've always put 5,000, because that's the max I can ask for.

46
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:11,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the question is, under the term other, can you just explain, this is for clarification.

47
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

48
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,250
[SPEAKER_03]: For the purposes of other.

49
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Could she have collected the difference of 15?

50
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of order, Councilor Nate.

51
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Your common practice is to allow people to speak at the podium.

52
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:28,651
[SPEAKER_03]: The Assistant City Solicitor is here.

53
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,092
[SPEAKER_03]: She's willing to answer the question.

54
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:35,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what his problem is tonight, but if he wants to keep disrupting me every time I speak, he can show his rudeness.

55
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:48,621
[SPEAKER_03]: The Solicitor wouldâ€” What is the gentleman suggesting that's problematic?

56
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,222
[SPEAKER_03]: What's problematic, Councilman Knight?

57
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:51,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me?

58
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:54,960
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean?

59
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's the floor.

60
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:58,222
[SPEAKER_03]: You better rest your case.

61
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you answer that please?

62
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:02,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, what was the question?

63
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:06,588
[SPEAKER_03]: The question on other, what does other mean?

64
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:12,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you take the money from other in terms of picking up the difference?

65
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:15,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm still not.

66
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:15,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

67
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:21,158
[SPEAKER_03]: On the chapter 84, you said the max is $5,000, but to get over and beyond that, there's a term there called other.

68
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:22,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any other way?

69
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:23,478
[SPEAKER_03]: to get that person up to the 6,500?

70
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,121
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of the case itself?

71
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:29,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Expenses?

72
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:29,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

73
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,202
[SPEAKER_05]: That type of thing?

74
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:30,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

75
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:36,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Under medical expenses, which I guess would fall under medical cost, but the way that's always been worded is other.

76
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:43,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I suspect it would fall under something that's not necessarily medical cost, but a copay, something to that effect.

77
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:46,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Out-of-pocket expenses will usually fall under other as well.

78
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:47,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

79
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:47,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

80
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. President.

81
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:52,166
[SPEAKER_01]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight.

82
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:53,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

83
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:54,967

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,911

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

95
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,933
[SPEAKER_01]: President Calviro?

[SPEAKER_01]: 17-723, request for an expenditure from our department.

[SPEAKER_01]: Claims offer $1,000.

00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:18,620

103
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you please give us a synopsis of the case, please?

107
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:41,434
[SPEAKER_05]: The claimant in this case is requesting compensation for injuries due to a street fact at or about 161 College Avenue, namely a pothole.

108
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:45,375
[SPEAKER_05]: As a result, she fractured her elbow and sustained a concussion.

109
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:45,815
[SPEAKER_05]: She was

110
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:58,066
[SPEAKER_05]: treated at Massachusetts General Hospital, and because her medical bills are in excess of $7,000, again, under the statute, I am requesting $5,000, which is the cap.

[SPEAKER_01]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

121
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,371
[SPEAKER_01]: They have two minutes to come in or the meeting will be adjourned.

122

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

123
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:29,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the City Council.

00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:37,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I cannot take those Mr. Dello Russo because the person that has made those requests is not here.

125
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:41,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mr. Clerk, if you, uh, we'll take a two minute recess.

[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to... You got five minutes, you had 10 minutes.
