1
00:00:03,592 --> 00:00:04,372
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:05,993 --> 00:00:08,174
33rd regular meeting of the Memphis City Council.

3
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:10,035
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

4
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:11,376
Presence.

5
00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:31,768
Four present, three absent.

6
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,649
Please rise and salute the flag.

7
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:48,175
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

8
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,317
17721, request for an expenditure from the law department.

9
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:51,817
Claims over $1,000.

10
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:58,820
Dear Mr. President and members of the assembly, Stephanie Burke, Mayor.

11
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,449
We have the Assistant City Solicitor here.

12
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,850
Name and address for the record, please.

13
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,130
Thank you, Mr. President.

14
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:11,674
My name is Kimberly Scanlon, Assistant City Solicitor for the City of Medford, and I reside at 75 Ashcroft Road.

15
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:15,795
Okay, could you give us a brief description of this case?

16
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:20,878
Sure, so I'm here tonight, three requests for expenditures.

17
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:29,622
This particular case involves Chapter 258 of the Massachusetts General Laws, also known as the Massachusetts Store Claims Act.

18
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:42,477
The claimant in this case is requesting $4,633.18 as compensation for property damage done to his vehicle on January 1st, which involved a fire department vehicle.

19
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:46,819
I received the appropriate paperwork from the claimant.

20
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:52,341
The case was settled prior to trial, and I am here tonight respectfully requesting approval in that amount.

21
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:53,021
Thank you.

22
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:58,643
On the motion of approval by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

23
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:01,208
Roll call has been requested.

24
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:01,928
Yes.

25
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:02,029
Yes.

26
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,250
For in the affirmative three absent motion passes 17 7 2 2 because of the expenditure, a lot of the problems claims over $1,000.

27
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,791
Dear Mr. Presidents and members of the office, city council, Stephanie Burke, Patricia Dyer,

28
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:30,605
versus the city of Medford.

29
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:37,432
Madam Solicitor, could you please give us a brief synopsis of the case?

30
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:38,693
Certainly, Mr. President.

31
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:44,859
The claimant in this case, and by the way, this case involves chapter 84, also known as the street defect statute.

32
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:53,187
The claimant in this case seeks compensation for injuries she suffered as a result of a uneven sidewalk panel on Grant Avenue.

33
00:02:54,312 --> 00:03:11,387
As she, due to her fall, she suffered cuts to her hands, her mouth, she broke her dentures, fractured her nose, and because her medical expenses exceed $6,500, I am requesting $5,000, which is the cap under the statute tonight.

34
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:12,748
Thank you.

35
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:18,072
On the motion by Councilor Del Rosso, excuse me, name and address of the record, please.

36
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:24,236
Mr. President, um, on this address to the record, please.

37
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:26,856
Robert Penta zero summit road, former member of this board.

38
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:32,738
Um, whether it be this question or the next one, it is maybe the terminology is wrong.

39
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:38,560
It says medical cost is 5,000, but in the narrative it says medical bills are in excess of 6,500.

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,801
Could that be just explain why it's five and not 65 the next day about the next one is the same thing.

41
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:45,221
Sure.

42
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:46,062
That's correct.

43
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:51,203
Because $5,000 is the cap that you can recover under chapter 84 of the general laws.

44
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:54,664
which also falls under this particular case and the next one as well.

45
00:03:55,224 --> 00:04:07,288
So for the medical, although they were in excess of $65, the maximum amount that I can ask for from this council is 5,000, which is why I've always put 5,000, because that's the max I can ask for.

46
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:11,749
Then the question is, under the term other, can you just explain, this is for clarification.

47
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,130
Sure.

48
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,250
For the purposes of other.

49
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,910
Could she have collected the difference of 15?

50
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,191
Point of order, Councilor Nate.

51
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,050
Your common practice is to allow people to speak at the podium.

52
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:28,651
The Assistant City Solicitor is here.

53
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,092
She's willing to answer the question.

54
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:35,395
I don't know what his problem is tonight, but if he wants to keep disrupting me every time I speak, he can show his rudeness.

55
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:48,621
The Solicitor wouldâ€” What is the gentleman suggesting that's problematic?

56
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,222
What's problematic, Councilman Knight?

57
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:51,983
Pardon me?

58
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:54,960
What does that mean?

59
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,900
I'm sure it's the floor.

60
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:58,222
You better rest your case.

61
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,884
Can you answer that please?

62
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:02,645
I'm sorry, what was the question?

63
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:06,588
The question on other, what does other mean?

64
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:12,032
Could you take the money from other in terms of picking up the difference?

65
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:15,234
I guess I'm still not.

66
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:15,614
Okay.

67
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:21,158
On the chapter 84, you said the max is $5,000, but to get over and beyond that, there's a term there called other.

68
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:22,059
Is there any other way?

69
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:23,478
to get that person up to the 6,500?

70
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,121
In terms of the case itself?

71
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:29,061
Expenses?

72
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:29,401
Yeah.

73
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,202
That type of thing?

74
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:30,582
Yeah.

75
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:36,224
Under medical expenses, which I guess would fall under medical cost, but the way that's always been worded is other.

76
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:43,087
I suspect it would fall under something that's not necessarily medical cost, but a copay, something to that effect.

77
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:46,129
Out-of-pocket expenses will usually fall under other as well.

78
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:47,429
Okay.

79
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:47,750
Thank you.

80
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,730
Thank you, Mr. President.

81
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:52,166
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Night.

82
00:05:52,606 --> 00:05:53,907
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

83
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:54,967
Councilor DelaRusso?

84
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:55,127
Yes.

85
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,328
Councilor Fevella?

86
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:56,608
No.

87
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:57,268
Councilor Night?

88
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:58,009
Yes.

89
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,350
Councilor Kerrio?

90
00:05:59,370 --> 00:05:59,570
Yes.

91
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,410
Vice-President Montz?

92
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:00,510
Yes.

93
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,911
Councilor Scott Pellegrino?

94
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:03,092
Yes.

95
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,933
President Calviro?

96
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:05,033
Yes.

97
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:07,174
For the affirmative, three absent.

98
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:10,736
Motion passes.

99
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:12,777
17-723, request for an expenditure from our department.

100
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:13,457
Claims offer $1,000.

101
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:18,620
Dear President and members of Honorable City Council, Stephanie Burke, client name,

102
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,570
Petra Alessio versus City of Medford.

103
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,131
Could you please give us a synopsis of the case, please?

104
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:25,971
Certainly.

105
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:28,172
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the City Council.

106
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:32,212
Again, my name is Kimberly Scanlon, the Assistant City Solicitor for the City of Medford.

107
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:41,434
The claimant in this case is requesting compensation for injuries due to a street fact at or about 161 College Avenue, namely a pothole.

108
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:45,375
As a result, she fractured her elbow and sustained a concussion.

109
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:45,815
She was

110
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:58,066
treated at Massachusetts General Hospital, and because her medical bills are in excess of $7,000, again, under the statute, I am requesting $5,000, which is the cap.

111
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:03,991
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

112
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:05,472
Councilor DelaRusso?

113
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:05,772
Yes.

114
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:07,774
Councilor Falco?

115
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:08,315
Yes.

116
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:10,977
Councilor Knight?

117
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:11,137
Yes.

118
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:15,307
Yes.

119
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:19,048
Uh, for the affirmative, uh, three absent motion passes.

120
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:22,930
Mr. Clerk, could you please go in and inform the other three members?

121
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,371
They have two minutes to come in or the meeting will be adjourned.

122
00:07:27,352 --> 00:07:28,252
Thank you, Mr. President.

123
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:29,332
Members of the City Council.

124
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:37,976
Um, I cannot take those Mr. Del Rosso because the person that has made those requests is not here.

125
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:41,657
So Mr. Clerk, if you, uh, we'll take a two minute recess.

126
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,718
Motion to... You got five minutes, you had 10 minutes.

127
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,081
Motion to resume the meeting.

128
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,462
All those in favor?

129
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:25,825
Motion passes.

130
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:25,825
17.

131
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:31,050
Suspension of the rules offered by Councilor Langlois-Kearns.

132
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:31,991
Seconded by?

133
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:34,613
Councilor Mox.

134
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:35,314
All those in favor?

135
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:36,876
Motion passes.

136
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:39,098
Councilor Langlois-Kearns.

137
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,143
Thank you, President Carviello.

138
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:47,367
I first could just ask that you mark Councilor Marks, Councilor Falco, and I present for this meeting.

139
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:50,110
We were over at the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.

140
00:09:50,130 --> 00:10:02,181
The Zoning Board of Appeals is gonna be gracious enough to let any city councilor that wants to speak on the matter of Medford Street and Broadway, a development that we've received a number of complaints on this week.

141
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:05,204
They're gonna allow us to speak in the next several minutes.

142
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:06,685
Okay, if we can get done quick, we can go over there.

143
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:15,220
We would, I would like, I would ask, respectfully ask that we take a break, a 20 minute recess.

144
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:25,186
On the motion by Council Member Kern to take a 20 minute recess to attend the Board of Appeals hearing, seconded by?

145
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:25,367
Seconded.

146
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:28,068
Seconded by Council Member Falco.

147
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:29,409
All those in favor?

148
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:29,489
Aye.

149
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,692
Mr. Clerk, the chair is in doubt.

150
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:36,274
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

151
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:38,513
Oh, excuse me, Councilor Knight.

152
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:45,755
Mr. President, looking at the papers that are remaining here, I think that if we put our heads down and just focus on what's going on, we'll be able to get out of here before 10 minutes is over.

153
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:48,937
I think we only have all the items on our agenda have been disposed of.

154
00:10:48,957 --> 00:11:00,441
The only items that we have here are a couple of under suspension items that Councilor Marks has put forward relative to some public, uh, public safety concerns that he has in the neighborhood from knocking on doors or from his, from his parks.

155
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:05,283
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

156
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:11,926
Yes.

157
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:12,846
No.

158
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:12,966
Yes.

159
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:13,167
Yes.

160
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:13,547
No.

161
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:17,510
Moves the speech to take 17-726.

162
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,191
Reading the prayer.

163
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:38,461
Madam Mayor, I'm sorry, Madam Vice Mayor.

164
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:38,601
17-726.

165
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:46,205
17-726, offered by Councillor Kerrio, be it resolved that the Council vote to push the October 31st meeting from 7 p.m.

166
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:47,226
to an 8 p.m.

167
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:47,526
start.

168
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:49,127
Roll call vote, please.

169
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:50,848
I believe...

170
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,936
We didn't wanna push the meeting to a Monday or Wednesday.

171
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:56,277
Can I just interject one second?

172
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:56,497
Yes.

173
00:11:56,557 --> 00:12:04,341
I was informed by the clerk that there is a National Grid hearing that evening at seven that he has already sent out a notification for.

174
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:05,941
Okay.

175
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:08,503
So, just wanna let you know that, so.

176
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,704
All right.

177
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:14,045
On the motion by Council Member Kern.

178
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:15,686
All those in favor.

179
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:20,028
Motion to adjourn.

180
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:29,398
Motion two is that we have no for the paper of the business.

181
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:32,941
We're all done with them.

182
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:34,062
We just did the last two.

183
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:38,907
We're all done with them.

184
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:41,910
The records of the meeting.

185
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:44,495
We're past two.

186
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:49,818
Is there a point of order, Mr. President?

187
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:50,819
Sorry to be late.

188
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,801
On 17-726, what was the resolution of that?

189
00:12:53,821 --> 00:13:04,648
17-726, there's already a hearing scheduled for 7 o'clock that evening with National Grid, and the clerk has already sent out notifications, so that could not happen.

190
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:11,215
Motion to table by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

191
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:12,175
All those in favor?

192
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:12,796
Aye.

193
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:13,836
Motion passes.

194
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:20,260
Reckons of October 17th will pass to Councilor Longo Kern, which we will table as she has gone.

195
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,862
Motion by Councilor Knight to table, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

196
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:25,202
All those in favor?

00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:32,486

199
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:33,627
All those in favor?

00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:35,068
Motion passes.

201
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:37,609
