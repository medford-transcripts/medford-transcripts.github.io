1
00:02:55,063 --> 00:03:02,386
As we let folks know who is going, I'm not sure that we voted on it, but maybe my colleagues can remind me if that's other.

2
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:09,769
Member Graham, we will have to take a vote at some point to identify who our delegate is to the Delegate Assembly and a backup.

3
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,492
And I am planning to attend as well, but I was not planning to try to be a delegate, so.

4
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:25,834
So I think we just need to figure out who all is interested in going, and then we can figure out how we make sure we have a delegate.

5
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:27,134
Got it.

6
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:28,175
Sounds good.

7
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:31,035
Mark, member Russo present.

8
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:33,295
Member Russo, we're just on the good of the order.

9
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:36,516
We're talking about the MASC conference, November 8th, 9th, and 10th.

10
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:41,837
And I think at a future meeting, we'll vote on who our delegate will be.

11
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:47,678
But until then, just let the superintendent know if you plan on going to the conference, I think.

12
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:50,538
Any other good of the orders?

13
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:52,579
Member McLaughlin?

14
00:03:53,379 --> 00:04:03,205
I just wanted to bring up the, and I know that we have a deadline, I think it's of December, but I just wanted to remind folks that we voted at the end of last session on goals and just being able to report out on our goals.

15
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:08,828
So I want to make sure that we're thinking about that this month as we prepare for reporting out.

16
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:09,829
I think it's in December.

17
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:10,890
Thank you.

18
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,191
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

19
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:25,208
Hearing and seeing no other good of the orders, I'll go on to the number three, the consent agenda, bills and payrolls, and our regular school committee meeting from June 12th, 2023.

20
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:27,809
Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

21
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,190
Motion to approve.

22
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,792
By Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hayes.

23
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:36,973
All those in favor?

24
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:37,493
Aye.

25
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:38,894
All those opposed?

26
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,514
Consent agenda is approved.

27
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:46,037
We have reports of subcommittees, rules, policy, subcommittee meeting, minutes,

28
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,451
from July 19th, 2023.

29
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:58,675
And then we also have, if I'll give you another second, we have rules and policy subcommittee meeting minutes from August 14th, 2023.

30
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:02,676
Member Roussell.

31
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:03,156
Thank you.

32
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:05,897
Those are actually not subcommittees meetings.

33
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:10,179
Those were actually special meetings and they're just filed on the agenda.

34
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:12,780
And

35
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:18,435
I'd motion to table those to the next meeting, because there are substantial edits that I think should be made.

36
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:22,998
Motion to table by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin.

37
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:23,918
All those in favor?

38
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:24,498
Aye.

39
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,221
All those opposed?

40
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:32,003
Reports of subcommittees has been tabled to our next meeting.

41
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:35,305
Number five, we have our report of our superintendent.

42
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:37,026
Superintendent's update and comments.

43
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:38,767
Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

44
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:42,309
Good evening, everyone.

45
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,001
It's wonderful to be back.

46
00:05:46,961 --> 00:06:01,747
So before I begin my update, I invite you all to join me in a moment of reflection on the 22nd anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.

47
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:12,731
It is a very sad day for many Americans, especially those of us with ties to Massachusetts, New York, and Washington, D.C.

48
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:19,997
The anniversary of 9-1-1 is a reminder for all of us that things can change unexpectedly in a moment.

49
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:31,902
We need to remember that over 3,000 individuals who died an untimely death, untimely and senseless death at the hands of terrorism.

50
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:38,565
May all their souls rest in peace and may their loved ones find solace and comfort in their memories.

51
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:52,995
Furthermore, we want to honor all of our firefighters, police, EMS, and other first responders who run into danger when most of us would run away from it.

52
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:59,997
There is no better time to say thank you to our first responders than today.

53
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,758
Before I shift gears to discuss our return to school,

54
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:20,057
I invite you all to reflect on a poem which one of my superintendent colleagues shared with me and all of the superintendents in Massachusetts this morning.

55
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:27,322
It's called The Power of One by Cheryl Sawyer.

56
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:37,309
As the soot and dirt and ash rain down, we became one color.

57
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:46,248
As we carried each other down the stairs of the burning building, we became one class.

58
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:55,732
As we lit candles of waiting and hope, we became one generation.

59
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:04,737
As we fell to our knees in prayer for strength, we became one faith.

60
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:15,252
As the firefighters and police officers fought their way into the inferno, we became one gender.

61
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:24,994
As we whispered or shouted words of encouragement, we spoke one language.

62
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:34,757
As we gave our blood in lines a mile long, we became one body.

63
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:43,787
As we mourned together the great loss, we became one family.

64
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:52,789
As we cried tears of grief and loss, we became one soul.

65
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:03,472
As we retell with pride of the sacrifice of heroes, we become one people.

66
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:27,897
We are one color, one class, one generation, one gender, one faith, one language, one body, one family, one soul, one people.

67
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:31,699
We are the power of one.

68
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,640
We are united.

69
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:38,366
We are America.

70
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:52,476
To honor the memory of all the lost, I respectfully ask that we all rise for a moment of silence to remember those who died on that dark day.

71
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:54,357
Thank you.

72
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:14,873
I thank you again.

73
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:28,395
I am going to shift gears because I would like to take some time to talk about our school opening and just coming back to school.

74
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:42,758
So although teachers and students reported back to the Medford Public Schools the week of August 28th, administrators and new teachers and staff returned the week prior.

75
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,363
Central administration was happy to welcome back our administrators together.

76
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:57,129
We're so excited and fortunate to welcome over 50 new staff to the Medford Public Schools community this school year.

77
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:07,576
On Wednesday, August 23rd, Dr. Bernadette Riccardelli organized a tour of Medford for our new teachers and staff.

78
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,539
The tour included stops at Tufts University,

79
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:15,687
the Medford Public Library, and Medford City Hall.

80
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:22,329
This tour wouldn't have been possible without the following individuals who I'd like to thank by name.

81
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:32,532
Rocco DiRico, Maggie Carril, and Lorena Denise Liza from the Tufts University Government and Community Relations team.

82
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:39,114
Nicole Perrault, our librarian and head of youth services with Medford Public Schools.

83
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:45,741
Mayor Brianna Longo Kern, and School Committee Vice Chair, Jenny Graham.

84
00:11:47,101 --> 00:12:00,348
Special thanks to Joseph's Transportation for the coach bus, and Lisa Evangelister, the former Medford Public Schools Public Information Officer, who helped to organize the tour.

85
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:06,071
We are so grateful for our partnerships with our community members.

86
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:10,213
So thank you all for that support during that launch week.

87
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:21,044
Later in the meeting, I will acknowledge many of our new administrators, principals, and staff who are able to join us this evening.

88
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:28,009
I also wanna take a moment to talk about the heat.

89
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:36,274
Last week threw us an unexpected curve ball with unusually warm temperatures for New England.

90
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:46,654
The heat showed us that there still are several pockets of HVAC challenges that have resurfaced across the district.

91
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:53,799
Our maintenance and facilities teams have been working tirelessly to keep our systems online.

92
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,943
And Dr. Cushing will discuss these items in more detail later on this evening.

93
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:12,419
But despite the heat, our teachers, staff, and students made the start of the school year a great one for our students especially.

94
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:20,266
And we're so grateful to all of our students and all of the educators for making it work despite the heat.

95
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,970
I also have some good news to share about athletics.

96
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:32,579
We were thrilled to start our fall athletic season with a big Mustang victory.

97
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,127
This game took place at home at Hormel Stadium.

98
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:41,969
Last week, it was our first football game.

99
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,031
And yes, we did win.

100
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:50,594
We stampeded to victory, as I said, playing on our Mustang mascot.

101
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:53,776
19 to seven, we played against Brookline.

102
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:59,860
I wanna take a moment to thank our wonderful band that played wonderfully.

103
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,921
They did a great job.

104
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:11,286
our color guard with their flags and dancing and all the moves that they had to do, our cheerleaders who cheered their hearts out.

105
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:25,854
And I wanna thank all of their coaches, all of their participation, even though we may not always think of them as sports, they're all our athletes and part of extracurricular activities with the schools.

106
00:14:27,996 --> 00:14:30,037
Medford students, Stevens Exeter,

107
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:35,782
was even named the Boston Globes Player of the Week.

108
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:41,886
So that's another just exciting piece of news for our Mustangs.

109
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:49,693
Other early Mustang victories include two four to zero shout outs against Chelsea.

110
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:56,215
by the girls varsity soccer team, and the boys JV soccer team.

111
00:14:56,716 --> 00:15:01,318
So congratulations to all of those athletic teams that really brought victory.

112
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:08,901
Last week, in recognition of extraordinary academic achievement

113
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:23,209
Last year's Mustang girls soccer team was one of 317 soccer teams throughout the United States to earn the special recognition.

114
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:26,554
The United soccer coaches.

115
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:38,263
presented our team with the high school team academic award this month for exemplary performance in the classroom as a team.

116
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:41,163
During the 2223 school year.

117
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:47,005
This is the first time that I recall ever mentioning this.

118
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,473
athletic academic award.

119
00:15:51,074 --> 00:16:03,796
So essentially they're looking at our athletes and our last year's Mustang girls soccer team achieved strong academic outcomes as well.

120
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:10,958
And they were recognized along with 317 other teams throughout the United States.

121
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:16,679
So I just feel that's a great accomplishment and I would love to give all of our athletes a round of applause.

122
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:20,929
Thank you.

123
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,911
School meals.

124
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,793
I hope, oh yes, and I see Rhetta here.

125
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:38,864
I just wanted to let you know, Rhetta Smith, we'll be introducing her shortly as well with our new administrators on board, but food service, the kids are gobbling up the lunches.

126
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:39,905
They're really happy.

127
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:41,887
It's a definitely new menu.

128
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:44,148
I hope you can look at the menu online.

129
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:49,173
We're really happy getting healthy nutrition and the students are happy and they're eating their food.

130
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:50,595
which is wonderful.

131
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:58,012
So we're really optimistic and we look forward to hearing much more good news in our food department.

132
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:06,334
I also wanna just share with the community that the Medford Public Schools has adopted a new messaging system.

133
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:16,660
I did mention this in last week's communication, but we have migrated to Blackboard Connect.

134
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:23,605
And so when we migrated and we sent out the first message on the new system,

135
00:17:24,997 --> 00:17:32,641
We were initially told that it would look the same so that our understanding was that it would be seamless.

136
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:36,244
You would receive it in your inbox and just receive a new message.

137
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:43,988
And it was quickly brought to our attention that it was saying no reply at notification.

138
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:48,250
So for some people, it ended up going into their spam boxes.

139
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:54,074
So once we got that information, we wanted to let everyone know that we migrated to a new system.

140
00:17:54,834 --> 00:18:04,582
And that signature that said in the past no reply at notification.com will now have a normal email address.

141
00:18:05,223 --> 00:18:16,052
So again, we have migrated to Blackboard Connect and this new messaging system will work collaboratively with our website and our other platforms.

142
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:21,496
So I just wanted to notify the committee and the community of that.

143
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,287
Yes.

144
00:18:27,927 --> 00:18:29,048
Yes, I just wanted to.

145
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:43,835
I've received I think my first email from that new blackboard system today from the principal of the high school and it was like we stepped into the next century it was clear it was formatted it was beautiful.

146
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:49,658
And I know that in the past you all have worked on your Friday updates and you have your actual update was

147
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,989
Nicely formatted, but then we had to send it out and it turned it into plain text and looked.

148
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:06,415
Not what you wanted, so I was extraordinarily happy today with the message that I got that i'm pretty sure I came out of blackboard so I want to thank everybody that did that work because.

149
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:14,840
I know it's not simple, but it makes a big difference as a parent when I received it, I could read the whole thing and.

150
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:16,402
a short amount of time.

151
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:21,206
And I didn't get lost and endless text so it was fabulous.

152
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,147
Thank you.

153
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:23,729
Thank you for that feedback.

154
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:32,237
We hope that as we continue to work on our official communications that everyone will see the quality of communications

155
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:39,266
improving and the presentation of the communications really being beautifully presented as well.

156
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:46,155
So that's going to continue to happen with the new platforms that we have, which now talk to one another.

157
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:48,739
So thank you for that.

158
00:19:51,013 --> 00:20:13,720
Last week was a celebration of Brazilian Independence Day that took place on Saturday, and Medford hosted it at the Andrews Middle School, we want to thank Mayor, the mayor's office, the Board of Health, and Marilia Barrosa and Samia Bennett for helping to organize the event.

159
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,804
And we are very lucky to have a thriving Brazilian American community here in our city.

160
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:24,407
So I hope they had a wonderful Independence Day this past Saturday.

161
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:30,271
Also, for the community to know, we have several curriculum nights coming up.

162
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:42,600
Tomorrow, September 12th, there will be curriculum nights at the Roberts Elementary School and the Missituck Elementary School.

163
00:20:43,829 --> 00:21:04,831
September 13 at the McGlynn middle school, September 14 at the books elementary school in the McGlynn elementary September 19 at the Andrews middle school and September 21 at Medford High School, and they are being held from six to eight o'clock.

164
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:09,156
And we have on September 19 as well.

165
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:14,643
Mrs Michelli's class and Mrs. Capraro Gentuso's classroom, Ms.

166
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:17,466
CG's classrooms at the Brooks School.

167
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:21,131
They will be holding their open houses on September 19 from 530 to 630 p.m.

168
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:41,058
I just want everyone to know that on Wednesday September 13 is our first kickoff meeting for the Medford special education parent Advisory Council CPAC, they will be meeting in person at Medford High School at 6pm.

169
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:53,406
Also, this Friday evening, September 15 until September 17 is the celebration of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.

170
00:21:53,846 --> 00:22:02,592
So we wish all of our Jewish friends in the community a very happy new year as they begin that celebration on Friday evening.

171
00:22:03,493 --> 00:22:09,997
And the additional updates will be in this coming Friday's memo.

172
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:20,580
So I would like to pause there and ask, are there any questions based on what I shared this morning, or this evening, I should say.

173
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:28,082
Thank you, Dr. Edward Benson for great updates.

174
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:31,003
I think you said six to eight for some of the

175
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:37,267
for the open houses but some might be 530 so I just make sure you look on the school website.

176
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:46,772
Okay, definitely look as, as I introduced if the principles are here and they heard the incorrect time, please let us know.

177
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:47,332
Thank you.

178
00:22:49,833 --> 00:23:00,879
And then if I just may, we have Brazilian flag day and the two ladies that you referenced our connectors and liaisons for the city they they speak

179
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:16,688
resilient and they're out building trust in the community and helping families with any needs they may have, such as mass health or, you know, finding any type of services that the city offers or that outside agencies offer.

180
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:26,797
And I mentioned it specifically for not only the people watching, but the principals and assistant principals that are in the audience, because if you have families that need support, the city of Medford has

181
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:42,583
think we're up to 10 community connectors and liaisons, Brazilian, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, there are a number of different connectors that we have so please lean on the city for some support if you need it.

182
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:44,324
Thank you.

183
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:46,006
Member McLaughlin.

184
00:23:46,186 --> 00:23:46,786
Yeah, thank you.

185
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:50,489
I just wanted to regarding the cultural brokers the community liaisons

186
00:23:52,313 --> 00:23:53,634
I guess one question, one comment.

187
00:23:53,834 --> 00:24:00,480
One is, I think this is fantastic and much, much needed and eager to work with them from the school perspective as well.

188
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,666
If a family is needing help or their assistance, can we understand the process?

189
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:28,347
Yeah, I don't know this, the school obviously has their own supports to but through the city, we have our office of prevention outreach under the Board of Health, so you would call you call either number and reach out to them that way, or we have our multilingual resource lines where you can speak any language, leave a message.

190
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:32,786
and somebody will return the call that speaks that language to provide you assistance.

191
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:35,929
So there's many ways to, but not many people know about it.

192
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:38,611
And obviously we want the people in need to know about it.

193
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:41,113
So we're trying to push it out as much as we can.

194
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:49,239
So any help, and I know the superintendent's great with doing that through her Friday updates, which she was a leader in making sure those are translated.

195
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:57,306
And that's one way we've been able to partner to make sure the word's out on not only the school offers, but also with the city's offering as supports.

196
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,131
for families, children, seniors, all of the above.

197
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:02,511
Thank you.

198
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:07,313
And just to follow up, several of them are also MassHealth certified application counselors.

199
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:10,154
Multiple are and a few more.

200
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,654
I think the rest are getting trained currently.

201
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,095
So that's great.

202
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:16,476
So just for accessing MassHealth for families within our schools as well.

203
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:19,537
I'm a certified application counselor in my day job.

204
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:24,318
So I just understand the responsibility involved in that and the folks that here are doing it.

205
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,619
I think it's super important for the community to know about.

206
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:38,046
Especially there's a mass health redetermination process underway right now where everybody is getting re determined, and a lot of people are losing insurance so it's super important that we share that.

207
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:38,526
Thank you.

208
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:49,494
Yes, we can, we can definitely be explicit about that in this Friday's communication as well to let, let the community know so we can work together to do that.

209
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:50,275
Thank you.

210
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:50,936
Thank you.

211
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:54,363
Thank you.

212
00:25:54,643 --> 00:26:02,741
Next up we have a welcome of all new administrators to the Metro Public Schools again by presented by Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, our superintendent.

213
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:05,530
So this is, I'm really excited.

214
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,012
We have a lot of people here tonight because we have a lot of new people on our team, which is wonderful.

215
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:20,256
And so there's really no particular order, but as I call you, I'm gonna ask you to come forward.

216
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:29,220
So the entire committee gets to see you and the community gets to see who all the new administrators are, the new members of our team.

217
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:38,292
So I'd like to invite the Andrews Middle School principal, Mrs. Jennifer Sking to come forward.

218
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,640
Yes, perfect.

219
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,621
The microphone's on.

220
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:50,261
Perfect.

221
00:26:50,682 --> 00:26:51,182
Good evening.

222
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:54,504
I'm excited to be here again to say hello.

223
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,847
The Andrews Middle School started our first week

224
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:06,173
actually our first day with some balloons and music and welcome back celebration, despite the rain, the students really had a great first day.

225
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:16,698
This past week, we introduced start with hello, which is a outreach through the Sandy Hook promise collaboration.

226
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:21,640
And this week, we also started our map testing for ELA.

227
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,821
So our students are working hard at that.

228
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:32,220
I guess I will say one of the most exciting things is that we welcome 10 new staff members to the Andrews Middle School.

229
00:27:33,321 --> 00:27:40,387
So it's been exciting to watch them already become integrated in the Andrews community.

230
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:45,451
And I don't feel so alone being the new guy on the street.

231
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:51,817
So thank you for having me and I look forward to working with all of you moving forward.

232
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:52,638
Thank you.

233
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:59,151
Can we have from the Brooks Elementary School the new assistant principal Michelle Burke.

234
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:07,738
We just have to wait for them.

235
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:07,818
Yes.

236
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:14,963
Member McLaughlin, could you turn on the mic if you could.

237
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:17,057
John.

238
00:28:17,117 --> 00:28:18,117
There it is.

239
00:28:18,537 --> 00:28:19,078
There we go.

240
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,218
Good evening, everyone.

241
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:21,398
It's a pleasure to be here.

242
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:29,400
I just want to say that I anticipated a warm welcome just from the interview process at the Brooks Elementary School.

243
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:33,962
And I was just overwhelmed with the warm welcome that I got.

244
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:35,502
I was completely blown away.

245
00:28:35,662 --> 00:28:39,143
I feel like I'm already a member of the Brooks family.

246
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:45,645
The staff, the administration, the families, the students have all been so welcoming.

247
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:48,890
and it really is a wonderful start for me.

248
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:58,872
I've had the pleasure of greeting families at the loop in front of the school, which has been a highlight of my recent, my past assistant principal position.

249
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:03,293
So I am delighted that I still get to be outside and greet students and families.

250
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,955
I've been working diligently in the cafeteria, supporting students and helping them to,

251
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:15,261
set some procedures in place and really enjoy their lunchtime because I think that's important.

252
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:22,789
And I look forward to supporting Shannon and everybody at the Brooks and I'm thrilled to be here.

253
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,791
Thank you so much.

254
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:24,672
Thank you.

255
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:25,593
Thank you, Shayla.

256
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:29,257
So Medford High School, Ms.

257
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:30,238
Marta Cabral.

258
00:29:32,455 --> 00:29:37,077
the new principal, and then we have three brand new members of your team.

259
00:29:38,238 --> 00:29:39,538
So Marta, what would you like?

260
00:29:39,598 --> 00:29:41,099
Yeah, as long as the lights on, you're good.

261
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:41,900
Okay.

262
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,680
Hi, everyone.

263
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,321
Thank you for welcoming me again.

264
00:29:44,341 --> 00:29:50,824
I am so excited to be principal of Medford High School, and I feel honored to be part of the Medford community.

265
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:54,871
along with the caregivers and students that I interact with each day.

266
00:29:54,891 --> 00:30:04,077
A couple things about Medford High School this past week, there's definitely some energy back in the air, I would say, in the high school, especially in the mornings.

267
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:10,782
It's great to see everyone come in and all the kids interacting with each other in the mornings and just really excited to be there.

268
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:20,465
Despite the heat, we had an attendance rate on Friday after our third day of heat of 94%, which is something that we were extremely proud of.

269
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:26,368
Our PTO, amazing PTO at the high school, served ice cream for all staff.

270
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:32,670
I asked them, I think at 10 in the morning and by 11 in the morning, we had ice cream for everyone that we served at the end of the day.

271
00:30:33,536 --> 00:30:42,879
Athletics kicked off this week, which I was extremely excited for being my first time going on the soccer field, as well as the football field.

272
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:45,659
And we had a couple wins, which was really exciting.

273
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:53,321
The superintendent mentioned that we had the football player named in the Boston Globe as the athlete of the week.

274
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,882
We know we have a lot of work to do at the high school.

275
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:57,943
We're really excited.

276
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:58,663
We're eager.

277
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:02,884
There's a lot of positivity in the air, and we're just ready to get to work.

278
00:31:03,117 --> 00:31:07,259
I'm excited to also introduce our new team as well at the high school.

279
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,119
Thank you.

280
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,240
Thank you, Marta.

281
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,401
So we have three new members of the high school team.

282
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:14,942
So I'm going to ask for Ms.

283
00:31:15,182 --> 00:31:22,025
Allison McDonald, Mr. Patrick, without a K, Hamilton, I love to say that, and Ms.

284
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:23,526
Sheila Freitas-Haley.

285
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:29,208
So these are three new assistant principals at the high school this year.

286
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:34,232
Allison since I mentioned you first you can have the floor first.

287
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:40,737
So I'm Allison it's nice to see me, meet some of you again I've met some of you already.

288
00:31:41,738 --> 00:31:52,747
It's been an amazing two weeks, three weeks, I am happy to come to work every day I love the kids the smiles in the morning it's my favorite thing in the morning to go outside and say just good morning to all the kids and

289
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:56,150
Hopefully that sets their tone for the day.

290
00:31:57,271 --> 00:32:02,234
And I have been welcomed so warmly and I already feel part of the community.

291
00:32:02,294 --> 00:32:03,494
So thank you all very much.

292
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:06,496
Hi, I'm Patrick.

293
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:07,437
Thanks for having me.

294
00:32:07,457 --> 00:32:12,960
I'm thrilled to be in Medford, thrilled to be assistant principal for your kids, for my kids now too.

295
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:18,664
I've been a teacher for over 20 years and making the switch over to being assistant principal has been

296
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:21,319
Believe it or not, super fun.

297
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,501
The kids are a joy to be around.

298
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:32,948
You know 99% of the time and I feel like we're really starting to gel as a team and I think we can make a difference here.

299
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:35,029
So thank you for giving me the opportunity.

300
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:35,930
I'm thrilled to be here.

301
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,231
Thank you Patrick.

302
00:32:37,992 --> 00:32:40,033
Hello, it's nice to meet all of you.

303
00:32:40,193 --> 00:32:42,914
I look forward to working for your community.

304
00:32:43,654 --> 00:32:50,117
I've worked in two districts my entire career, 20 plus years, Fall River, Massachusetts and Somerville.

305
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:52,778
Please don't hold that against the Somerville thing.

306
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,459
I want to retire a Mustang.

307
00:32:57,379 --> 00:33:03,682
I was at that football game and to see one of your athletes be the Boston Globe

308
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:12,410
athlete of the of the week is just fantastic, and I've been welcomed warmly by everybody in Central.

309
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:20,097
Marta is amazing, Chad is amazing, and I am so excited and look forward to retiring a Mustang.

310
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:21,037
Go Mustangs.

311
00:33:21,998 --> 00:33:22,779
Thank you.

312
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,923
Roberts Elementary School, this is Michelle Kroll.

313
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:31,879
Hello everybody.

314
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,541
Um, we've had a great start at the Roberts.

315
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:43,885
Um, I think the number one thing that sticks out for me right now is just the sheer level of excitement, not just excitement with the kids.

316
00:33:44,266 --> 00:33:52,389
So my kids are sitting in the classrooms and they're excited to be there and they're participating, they're writing and they're doing math already.

317
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:59,513
And there's just this level of, um, engagement that is so impressive of the kids already.

318
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:07,859
My staff, the staff is ready and they are super positive right now and ready to tackle the new curriculum that's in front of us.

319
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,464
And just ready to get right down to work with all of their students.

320
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:22,851
I think the way in which I've been accepted by my families and the school community has just been

321
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:24,809
Amazing.

322
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,572
Um, I held a popsicle event right before school started.

323
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:30,373
I had hundreds of families show up.

324
00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:32,695
We ran out of popsicles at quarter of seven.

325
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:35,537
Um, it was a full family event for me.

326
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:38,579
So my husband and my kids served popsicles to everybody.

327
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,021
Um, it was a great event.

328
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:49,467
And then just the parent coffees that I've had and the participation and the families are so ready to open the doors to the Roberts.

329
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:55,133
to get everybody involved and really bring some activities back to the Roberts.

330
00:34:56,154 --> 00:34:56,934
And they're just ready.

331
00:34:57,074 --> 00:34:59,675
We're ready to kind of bring on the new school year.

332
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:01,816
And we're just, we're excited.

333
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:02,917
We're really excited.

334
00:35:03,277 --> 00:35:03,757
So thank you.

335
00:35:04,097 --> 00:35:04,758
Thank you.

336
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:05,858
Thank you, Michelle.

337
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:07,839
Ms.

338
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:13,902
Crowell, if you see a nine-year-old blonde ugly mullet, please make sure he's in line.

339
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:14,802
Thank you.

340
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:22,862
We have one administrator who couldn't be with us today, Mr. Gerald McHugh.

341
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:31,765
He is our new interim director of finance, but he is another very welcome, positive addition to the team.

342
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:37,606
I also would like to, at this moment, welcome Ms.

343
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:43,168
Gabby DaCosta, who is our registration specialist at the PIC.

344
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:46,369
Ooh, Gabby.

345
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:47,129
Hello.

346
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:48,550
Thanks for welcoming me.

347
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,011
I wasn't expecting this since I started in June.

348
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:55,653
Since June, we have received over 300 registrations.

349
00:35:56,173 --> 00:35:58,374
And the last three weeks have been very, very busy.

350
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,796
And, you know, staying afloat, you know, we're getting on track.

351
00:36:02,436 --> 00:36:05,937
And this has been a little bit less busy, but it's good.

352
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:07,978
We're welcoming families from all over.

353
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:10,699
And yeah, thanks for welcoming me.

354
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,061
Gabby, can you share with us how many languages you speak?

355
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:15,471
I speak four languages.

356
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:18,172
Can you share with the committee your four languages?

357
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,333
I'm French-Canadian, so I speak French.

358
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:27,116
My parents were Portuguese, Spanish, and French, yeah, and English.

359
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:29,477
I forget about that one sometimes.

360
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:31,317
Gabby, thank you.

361
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:32,718
Thank you so, so much.

362
00:36:32,798 --> 00:36:42,001
I wanted to make sure that everyone knows who Gabby is and she's able to, you use your multilingual skills every single day in the PIC.

363
00:36:42,262 --> 00:36:43,222
So thank you so much.

364
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:51,742
I would also like to introduce Mr. Thomas Dalton, who is our new communications director.

365
00:36:52,522 --> 00:36:52,922
Thomas.

366
00:36:56,304 --> 00:36:57,505
Thanks, Dr. Vincent.

367
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:58,165
Good to see you all.

368
00:36:58,185 --> 00:37:00,467
I've had the chance to meet most of you at this point.

369
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:07,451
Started earlier this summer, but really excited to be here in the district in this new communications director role.

370
00:37:07,871 --> 00:37:11,893
There's so many good things going on in Medford Public Schools.

371
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,735
Makes my job pleasantly simple.

372
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,531
My job really is just to take the good news and get it out there.

373
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:28,255
And so that means that we're, as the superintendent already discussed, updating some of our email systems, making sure the website is in great working order.

374
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,155
I'm crazy about the website.

375
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:42,220
It was very exciting for me when I came here to see the terrific website and excited to continue to build on that, that work that's been done, I know, very diligently over the last couple of years on the website.

376
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:50,036
And just in general, working with all of the great leaders and educators across the district, like I said, to keep getting the good news out.

377
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:55,978
So excited to work with this committee, already having a great time working with the school community.

378
00:37:56,898 --> 00:38:04,300
And look for me in your inboxes, check your spam folders maybe, and we'll make sure we keep getting the good news out.

379
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:04,820
So thank you.

380
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,081
Thank you, Thomas.

381
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:11,162
And I'd like to invite up, last but definitely not least, Mrs. Reva Smith.

382
00:38:14,716 --> 00:38:16,576
our new food service director.

383
00:38:17,517 --> 00:38:18,537
Come on up, Brenda.

384
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:25,358
Hi, I was told that I did not have to say anything, so thanks for that.

385
00:38:25,978 --> 00:38:29,779
I'm really happy to be back at Medford Public Schools in the food service department.

386
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:40,741
So there's a lot of work to be done, but I have gotten a lot of nice feedback from kids, parents, administrators from every school.

387
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:42,802
So that's been really reassuring.

388
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:46,411
And I'm just, if people are happy now, just wait.

389
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:50,294
Mayor.

390
00:38:50,574 --> 00:38:51,135
Member Russo.

391
00:38:52,295 --> 00:38:52,996
Thank you.

392
00:38:53,116 --> 00:38:54,937
So I'm beyond thrilled.

393
00:38:54,957 --> 00:39:02,783
I mean, we finally have universal free meals and that's been something I've been harping on continuously for nearly six years.

394
00:39:04,184 --> 00:39:06,226
So I'm very excited that that's there.

395
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:10,189
I look forward to hearing how that affects your budget and, you know,

396
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:21,514
You have enough work to do today, but someday it'd be nice to know how that, because I've certainly received questions like, how does that change how much money is there to spend in the food services department?

397
00:39:21,615 --> 00:39:23,555
And that's not a question for now.

398
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:25,176
But I do want to also say that.

399
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,476
That's on how many meals.

400
00:39:27,336 --> 00:39:29,577
It's how many meals are eaten.

401
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:31,578
So hopefully more people will be eating more meals.

402
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:32,998
Yeah.

403
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:37,620
So I did receive several unsolicited texts, and I

404
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:45,144
Honestly, I did not think that already the food would be better because you started like

405
00:39:47,837 --> 00:39:50,738
eight weeks ago, six, seven weeks ago, not long ago.

406
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:51,638
Yeah.

407
00:39:52,158 --> 00:40:00,720
And, but I did receive several unsolicited texts from parent friends of mine who were like, I don't know if it's possible, but my kids have already said the food is better.

408
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:09,482
And then someone who's a para at one of the elementary schools says, yeah, there's, there's fresh food to eat, like fresh fruits and vegetables.

409
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:13,163
And I just was like,

410
00:40:13,936 --> 00:40:15,477
dearly in tears with happiness.

411
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:20,699
It's like if after less than two months, this is what we have moved towards.

412
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:24,560
I'm beyond excited for what's to come.

413
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,921
So thank you so much.

414
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:27,801
You're welcome.

415
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:28,822
Happy to do it.

416
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:30,282
Thank you.

417
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:34,724
So can we just give a round of applause for all of our new administrators?

418
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:35,964
Thank you for coming out.

419
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:38,845
Thank you for joining Mustang Nation.

420
00:40:38,985 --> 00:40:40,106
We're so glad to have you.

421
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:49,524
Yes, thank you for joining us tonight, and we have high hopes.

422
00:40:51,704 --> 00:40:53,305
I know we're going on to number three.

423
00:40:53,345 --> 00:41:00,326
I see our president of the union here, who I know has a long commute, so I don't know if we want to move anything out of order.

424
00:41:00,346 --> 00:41:00,987
I'm not sure.

425
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:02,787
Mayor?

426
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:04,147
Member Russo?

427
00:41:05,168 --> 00:41:12,549
Motion to suspend the rules and take item... Once I find the item number.

428
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:13,550
Four.

429
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,890
Item number...

430
00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:18,437
operations update.

431
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:20,938
Oh, I thought it was going to be one of these.

432
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:23,499
We could do it under a number four.

433
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:27,040
Take number four out of order out of order.

434
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:30,281
Second motion by Dr. Christian.

435
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:35,543
Oh, Dr. Christian, we're gonna take out of order number four out of order.

436
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:43,546
operations update by Dr. Peter Cushing assistant superintendent operations and enrichment and innovation

437
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:51,373
We know this has a large part to do with the air conditioning, but we have the union president here to speak on that.

438
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:52,694
So thank you.

439
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,356
Do a roll call or just a favor to take number four out of order.

440
00:41:56,036 --> 00:41:56,296
Aye.

Aye.

491
00:42:03,641 --> 00:42:03,701
Aye.

492
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:03,781
Aye.

493
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:05,502
Aye.

494
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:05,622
Aye.

495
00:42:05,662 --> 00:42:05,742
Aye.

496
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:05,822
Aye.

497
00:42:05,962 --> 00:42:06,042
Aye.

498
00:42:06,062 --> 00:42:06,142
Aye.

499
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:06,262
Aye.

500
00:42:06,282 --> 00:42:06,343
Aye.

501
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:06,423
Aye.

502
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:06,543
Aye.

503
00:42:06,563 --> 00:42:06,623
Aye.

504
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:06,703
Aye.

505
00:42:06,723 --> 00:42:06,783
Aye.

506
00:42:06,823 --> 00:42:06,943
Aye.

507
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:07,043
Aye.

508
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:07,123
Aye.

509
00:42:07,143 --> 00:42:07,203
Aye.

510
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:07,283
Aye.

511
00:42:07,303 --> 00:42:07,363
Aye.

512
00:42:07,423 --> 00:42:07,483
Aye.

513
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:07,563
Aye.

514
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:07,643
Aye.

515
00:42:07,723 --> 00:42:07,823
Aye.

516
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:08,044
Aye.

517
00:42:08,064 --> 00:42:08,164
Aye.

518
00:42:08,184 --> 00:42:08,324
Aye.

519
00:42:08,344 --> 00:42:08,404
Aye.

520
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:08,484
Aye.

521
00:42:08,504 --> 00:42:08,564
Aye.

522
00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:08,724
Aye.

523
00:42:08,744 --> 00:42:08,844
Aye.

524
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:08,964
Aye.

525
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:09,144
Aye.

526
00:42:09,164 --> 00:42:09,264
Aye.

527
00:42:09,284 --> 00:42:10,005
Aye.

528
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:10,105
Aye.

529
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:15,981
It's been a while.

530
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:28,724
All right, so I'm gonna cover several areas that were detailed in the report that I issued to you last week.

531
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:35,045
So transportation first, all of our bus drivers, we are thankfully fully staffed.

532
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:44,547
We are going to be issuing, for the first time ever, Medford Public Schools identification badges to our bus drivers so they're easily identifiable when they enter buildings.

533
00:42:45,403 --> 00:42:53,109
We conducted ride-alongs on elementary school buses last week, 13 buses, school leaders, engagement specialists as well.

534
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,352
The bus I had had six full empty rows behind me.

535
00:42:57,132 --> 00:43:02,437
Students were overall exceptionally well-behaved and very respectful, and the driver was phenomenal.

536
00:43:03,357 --> 00:43:10,083
Currently working with a new manager at Eastern Bus for the first time since I've been with MedPrep Public Schools.

537
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:13,225
So that's a definite plus sheet,

538
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,131
did start the week before school.

539
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:17,892
So she is getting up to speed very quickly.

540
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:24,135
We're also currently working to add a new stop for a private new afterschool program that's on High Street.

541
00:43:24,155 --> 00:43:28,797
It poses a challenge because that bus may be facing some overcrowding on.

542
00:43:28,877 --> 00:43:34,259
So because of this, it's a good problem to have that our kids have afterschool care available to them.

543
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,501
One other thing, met with the chief of police as we do every other week.

544
00:43:38,981 --> 00:43:43,043
He is requesting anyone interested in a traffic supervisor position

545
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,952
That should be posted on our Facebook page at seven o'clock tonight.

546
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:52,834
So if anyone's interested, it's a great position through the city of Medford.

547
00:43:53,334 --> 00:43:56,036
That is a really has a lot of benefits to it.

548
00:43:56,736 --> 00:44:00,238
And late buses will beginning tomorrow for the middle schools.

549
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:02,559
So that's a quick overview of transportation.

550
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:07,881
We've also identified some overcrowding areas and we're actively working with the new manager to fix that.

551
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:20,607
So maintenance and cleaning district wide summer cleaning really involves floors stripped and waxed, bathrooms deep clean, floor tiles replaced at various school locations.

552
00:44:21,007 --> 00:44:26,231
Primarily the Missittuck had a significant floor tiling done and replaced.

553
00:44:27,392 --> 00:44:31,515
Security office at Medford High School is being moved to be more centrally located with our students.

554
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:37,060
Science labs had some HVAC work done in the computer controller that needed to be replaced.

555
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,582
High school offices are being updated

556
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:49,877
Principal's Office as an example and Assistant Principal's Office being converted from a conference room to spaces that can be really used for meetings and the opportunity to engage with community members.

557
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:58,001
We're currently doing an assessment of the Brooks Turf and we'll be working to bring in the repairs to have it re-seamed and re-sanded.

558
00:44:58,802 --> 00:45:01,783
For those of you who are aware, the Brooks Turf was installed about six years ago.

559
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:10,547
And we're going to make sure that that is part of our update moving forward, not update our annual maintenance program moving forward.

560
00:45:11,427 --> 00:45:21,634
The Brooks and Roberts through grants of the CPA had playground money allocated as well as Esther money allocated so we spent $32,000.

561
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:28,123
between all of those funding sources to make sure that the playground equipment has been updated.

562
00:45:28,763 --> 00:45:29,843
It is finally shipping.

563
00:45:30,183 --> 00:45:34,864
It has been a high level of consternation getting the playground equipment actually shipped to us.

564
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:42,466
And just the delays, I guess, post pandemic, I honestly can't say because we haven't gotten an answer, but it is finally being shipped.

565
00:45:42,546 --> 00:45:43,846
It should be at Medford High School.

566
00:45:43,986 --> 00:45:51,388
And now we're actively hounding for an install date so that it doesn't just sit on a loading dock for an extended period of time.

567
00:45:51,946 --> 00:45:54,828
It does need to be installed by professionally licensed installers.

568
00:45:54,888 --> 00:45:58,510
It's not something we can do on our own liability reasons.

569
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:01,792
McGlynn Playground, we went out to bid.

570
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:06,015
We have a bid secured and we're really excited.

571
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:09,329
that this project is about to lift off.

572
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:11,489
And so it's really awesome.

573
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:21,192
I want to thank member McLaughlin, member Graham, Shanine Peliquin, the mayor, and Alicia Hunt, and everyone else on the committee.

574
00:46:21,352 --> 00:46:24,713
Can't name them all right now, but really, thank you, thank you, and thank you.

575
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:27,673
And just really phenomenal.

576
00:46:27,773 --> 00:46:33,455
I do want to say Denise Desjardins for being the teacher's representative who saw the project through as well.

577
00:46:35,054 --> 00:46:37,436
All throughout the district, we had rugs cleaned and shampooed.

578
00:46:37,956 --> 00:46:43,340
We're currently going through a on bill repayment of school lighting upgrades.

579
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:53,668
So the Andrews is completely done from previous work, but we're currently working to have Medford High School have buildings A and C. Right now, the

580
00:46:54,164 --> 00:46:56,605
It's parabolic lighting, so it focuses down.

581
00:46:56,985 --> 00:47:02,567
It doesn't really provide much lighting in the hallways and the hallways have kind of a dungeon feel to them at times.

582
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:11,369
So hopefully this lighting will really give a better feel to the hallways as students move through them, as well as other areas of the building.

583
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:17,491
So that's on bill repayment with mass save, saving us money and not costing us anything.

584
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:21,532
I believe the electric rate went up about 30% last year.

585
00:47:21,692 --> 00:47:23,993
So this will help us as time moves forward.

586
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:28,651
We're also reviewing options for a work order system.

587
00:47:29,371 --> 00:47:35,113
We're looking at two right now, but considering probably a third option coming up.

588
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:38,834
One is called operations hero.

589
00:47:39,354 --> 00:47:44,616
Then we have our school today, which right now manages our facility for rentals and things like that.

590
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:49,477
So that's kind of our league leader and we'll kind of consider another one as well moving forward.

591
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:58,725
Technology mass communication system, as was mentioned, it connects with our website as final site was our website, blackboard and final site merge.

592
00:47:59,305 --> 00:48:10,013
We also purchased a three year license with s'more so that our principles, athletics and central office can deliver s'more newsletters that also has an integration with blackboard final site.

593
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:12,054
And we're really excited about that.

594
00:48:12,074 --> 00:48:14,496
And as Thomas and Superintendent mentioned, we are

595
00:48:14,898 --> 00:48:20,259
working through that no reply at to hopefully get that resolved as quickly as possible.

596
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:25,560
So we also have implemented incident IQ.

597
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:36,962
There are 7,600 devices across Metro public schools right now, and 98 pieces of equipment that might be a one of the smart touch boards or projector or various things like that.

598
00:48:37,802 --> 00:48:40,843
So we have more projectors than that throughout the district.

599
00:48:42,204 --> 00:48:50,526
We're still loading equipment in, but 7600 devices across the district, Chromebooks, desktops and MacBooks for teachers.

600
00:48:51,486 --> 00:48:57,927
So it's a help desk and a technology management system to manage our extensive equipment.

601
00:48:58,607 --> 00:49:09,789
Huddle cameras, they'll be installed in the field house for basketball and other events, basketball, volleyball, and also at the Field of Dreams and Cormel Stadium.

602
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:16,871
so that anywhere in the world parents will be able to log on and view their child's athletic events.

603
00:49:18,412 --> 00:49:21,394
So that's a nice little upgrade there that we're working on.

604
00:49:22,535 --> 00:49:34,883
I do want to say just real quick, going back, I do need to thank Kim Miles for all the work she did to help deploy Final Sight, Blackboard, the messaging, and Thomas as he came on board.

605
00:49:34,943 --> 00:49:36,504
The project started previously, but

606
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:43,432
Those two really helped me to land that project successfully in a really short runway.

607
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:46,034
So just really excited about that.

608
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:54,898
Security, we've done a comprehensive review of all security procedures and security devices across the district as the community is aware.

609
00:49:54,938 --> 00:50:02,182
We're working diligently to make sure that we can make things happen on that without going into too much more detail for security reasons.

610
00:50:02,882 --> 00:50:05,984
All principals have been trained in what's called the standard response protocol,

611
00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:17,384
It's moving away from the older language that shelter-in-place and various other things like that that might be confusing and fear-inducing for a lot of families.

612
00:50:17,404 --> 00:50:22,367
Shelter-in-place comes from Cold War era atomic concerns.

613
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:27,470
So we're moving from that and we're moving to the I love you guys foundations.

614
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:31,472
Hold, secure, lockdown, evacuate, shelter.

615
00:50:32,352 --> 00:50:36,274
Essentially, mostly would be a hold of secure for things that we need.

616
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:41,507
And it didn't move forward or back.

617
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:42,328
I apologize.

618
00:50:44,011 --> 00:50:45,474
So all principals were trained.

619
00:50:45,494 --> 00:50:48,419
We're going to deploy training for all staff throughout the district.

620
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,502
They were given a brief introduction on day one.

621
00:50:53,643 --> 00:50:56,166
We are having ongoing meetings with the Medford Police.

622
00:50:56,226 --> 00:50:58,347
We've initiated meetings with Medford Fire.

623
00:50:59,188 --> 00:51:05,254
We're revamping our fire drill procedures to account for all staff and students as they evacuate the buildings.

624
00:51:05,554 --> 00:51:07,215
That may not have happened on the first.

625
00:51:07,596 --> 00:51:09,738
However, it is going to be moving forward.

626
00:51:10,218 --> 00:51:15,583
Our principals and assistant principals were assessing and will be making those changes as we go forward.

627
00:51:17,165 --> 00:51:25,369
All principals and assistant principals are being issued confidential immediate response protocols so that they can deal with things in a standardized manner.

628
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:31,012
We've initiated school and district crisis teams to be formed at those levels.

629
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:40,158
And I'm gonna be working with our municipal partners to create a municipal safety council for the schools that would meet quarterly.

630
00:51:41,138 --> 00:51:45,861
Training is scheduled for September 30th and all remaining half days for our door monitors

631
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:55,742
in the areas of CPR, standard response protocol, and various other trainings to make sure that they are well-versed for their roles.

632
00:51:58,644 --> 00:52:04,107
Human resources, over 70 teachers and paraprofessionals, seven school leaders that you met this evening.

633
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:10,010
Our director of food services, can't say again enough how awesome that is, personally.

634
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:15,233
Communications director, interim director of finance, registration specialist was June, but still,

635
00:52:15,902 --> 00:52:18,864
and other security monitors, just to name a few.

636
00:52:19,064 --> 00:52:22,427
We've got some custodian jobs posted as well for anyone who may be interested.

637
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:24,048
Food services.

638
00:52:24,888 --> 00:52:28,671
So we have a new first services director, as has been previously mentioned now three times.

639
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,272
Universal free meals.

640
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:39,959
I would actually ask for this body to motion for the Metro Public Schools School Committee to issue a formal letter of thanks to our state delegation.

641
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:44,282
I can't tell you how important this is for our students,

642
00:52:45,089 --> 00:52:49,010
and how critical it is in an era of food insecurity.

643
00:52:49,630 --> 00:53:02,533
And it's gonna offer so many opportunities for the Medford Public Schools and other schools to really be in families' corners in helping their kids get those two important meals a day.

644
00:53:03,893 --> 00:53:09,934
And we have exciting things to come, but that's something I would request that the committee works on.

645
00:53:10,578 --> 00:53:12,740
We have a comprehensive equipment audit going on.

646
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:18,525
It turns out there's a lot of equipment that needs to be addressed across the district, and we've already started on that work.

647
00:53:18,886 --> 00:53:21,308
We've already got purchase orders moving out.

648
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:24,311
We're replacing six of our milk coolers.

649
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:31,097
We're examining a gradual shift to electric cooking over gas as we need to make replacements.

650
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:38,150
We have an improved menu and we have new point of sales machines within online portal called School Cafe.

651
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:45,052
All of your balances for families that may have been zeroed out last year have been restored and moved.

652
00:53:45,132 --> 00:53:50,694
If anyone sees an issue, please feel free to contact me or meals at medford.k12.ma.us.

653
00:53:52,895 --> 00:54:04,062
We also have, for the first time ever, a climate controlled food delivery van to actually move food between buildings on hot days so it doesn't spoil while in the back of the van.

654
00:54:04,262 --> 00:54:12,987
So that was purchased last March and has been now put out into service after some minor modifications last year by our CTE students.

655
00:54:13,688 --> 00:54:21,272
Again, need to really thank Kim Miles for all of her help in getting the new point of sale, all the data uploaded for that.

656
00:54:21,412 --> 00:54:22,653
So she's been really helpful

657
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:27,278
to Redder and to everybody to make sure that that has been taken care of.

658
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:29,540
All right, HVAC.

659
00:54:31,862 --> 00:54:36,527
So, HVAC stands for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.

660
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:42,052
During the pandemic, the work was focused on air movement.

661
00:54:42,092 --> 00:54:46,797
A significant amount of the equipment at Medford High School was not functional at that time.

662
00:54:47,991 --> 00:54:54,577
that much of the work during the pandemic was on getting air A moving and B, filtering it.

663
00:54:55,438 --> 00:55:01,303
The filtration at that time was recommended to be upgraded to MERV 13 filters.

664
00:55:02,244 --> 00:55:07,388
That is above the specification of almost any of the equipment in the district.

665
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:14,234
And I say almost, because I'm not 100% sure on the science lab that was updated in 2013,

666
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:20,496
I also do want to make clear to everybody that I am not an HVAC expert.

667
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:27,080
However, since last March or so, I've done a lot to really educate myself.

668
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,062
So those are two really critical things.

669
00:55:30,322 --> 00:55:33,584
It's air movement and air filtering during the pandemic.

670
00:55:34,184 --> 00:55:42,189
It was not the conditioning of the air, be that heat or be that cooling, right?

671
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:45,091
In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency banned

672
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:58,145
R22 refrigerant as an environmental, I guess, hazard, if I can go that far, in new construction of HVAC equipment.

673
00:55:58,385 --> 00:56:02,506
In 2020, they banned it completely for production and importation.

674
00:56:03,207 --> 00:56:04,007
So what does that do?

675
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:09,569
It makes the existing supply, all right, a scarce resource.

676
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,751
The product has escalated tenfold.

677
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:20,820
A 30-pound can that may have cost $100 before may now cost as much as $2,000, which is 20-fold.

678
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:27,762
But we're seeing in the neighborhood of about $1,150 to $1,400 to get those.

679
00:56:28,082 --> 00:56:43,146
To recharge parts of the system, once again, not an expert, but talking to the people that work for us and our contractors, as well as our maintenance team that has done a great job, that may take four canisters for one recharge of a system.

680
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:49,645
So there are skyrocketing costs for those existing and reclaimed supplies.

681
00:56:50,085 --> 00:57:00,771
The only way that you can get R22 in the United States now is it's either existing or it's been reclaimed, recycled, and I'm forgetting the third one, but that's what it is.

682
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:11,097
In 2019, we spent about 208, sorry, about $206,000 to repair a number of compressors and other components of the equipment at the Brooks, the Roberts, and the Missituck.

683
00:57:12,301 --> 00:57:27,589
That same $206,000 and talking to our consultant on Friday for about 45 minutes driving in, Thursday, it was Thursday, would probably cost north of 700,000 for the exact same repairs.

684
00:57:28,229 --> 00:57:33,372
So the exact same repairs, you're talking between three and four times as much for those repairs.

685
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:48,476
Knowing that we had an issue with the Andrew system, not fully knowing the extent of any other issues that we may have had, but knowing that we had an issue with the Andrew system, which is part of the building the future schools, 22 years old.

686
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:53,319
It's not like a classic automobile.

687
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,881
These are building systems that will eventually need to be replaced.

688
00:58:00,362 --> 00:58:01,102
Why do I say that?

689
00:58:01,142 --> 00:58:04,464
Well, Alicia Hunt was really good when I started talking to her.

690
00:58:05,174 --> 00:58:08,616
about how do we really look at and address these problems?

691
00:58:09,356 --> 00:58:10,937
She committed $50,000.

692
00:58:11,117 --> 00:58:15,459
We, as a school, looked for the overall cost of the study.

693
00:58:15,899 --> 00:58:19,621
There were a couple of add-ons that we pulled out of ESSER funding in the neighborhood of about $14,000.

694
00:58:20,401 --> 00:58:25,563
And we expect that report, I was hoping to have it about this week.

695
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:31,066
It'll probably be the first week of October after receiving an update from the organization.

696
00:58:32,296 --> 00:58:43,204
Um, but it's going to give having this assessment done is going to give us the best information as how to replace not just the Andrew system, but all of the other aging systems across the district.

697
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:51,350
And while we may not be having major issues right now, I'd say the miss a tuck in the Roberts, the Brooks overall is doing fairly well.

698
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:55,993
But there is one A. C. C. U. Air cooled chilling unit.

699
00:58:56,173 --> 00:58:59,435
I think our air air cooled compressor unit.

700
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:00,136
I apologize.

701
00:59:00,196 --> 00:59:00,956
It's in the report.

702
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:01,857
I don't have it in front of me.

703
00:59:02,675 --> 00:59:14,503
Um, so four of six compressors and I think a CC one have gone down the McGlynn has a lot of work that needs to be done.

704
00:59:14,683 --> 00:59:19,046
The there are two systems that cool most of these buildings.

705
00:59:19,146 --> 00:59:23,408
Now there are two systems that cool all these buildings, with the exception of Medford High School and the Curtis Tufts.

706
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:24,129
Sorry.

707
00:59:25,053 --> 00:59:32,976
Um, and the first is what's known as a chiller system that moves cooled glycol liquid throughout that system.

708
00:59:34,216 --> 00:59:36,177
Um, and then gets blown.

709
00:59:36,417 --> 00:59:39,358
The air gets blown over through the unit ventilators.

710
00:59:40,238 --> 00:59:48,221
Our maintenance department has done an amazing job maintaining and keeping these things running to a certain degree.

711
00:59:48,821 --> 00:59:51,442
But there comes a point of capital investment.

712
00:59:51,882 --> 00:59:54,283
The B two Q assessment report

713
00:59:54,810 --> 01:00:04,055
is going to give the public schools in the city of Medford, the understanding to actually know what we need to do to fix these challenges ahead of us.

714
01:00:06,097 --> 01:00:06,977
Yes.

715
01:00:10,419 --> 01:00:14,922
I just want to thank you I just want to be clear so the report will include both the

716
01:00:16,192 --> 01:00:36,239
how to get all the parts that are in this report functioning, but it will also include, which is really, I mean, they're both interesting, but, you know, you can't just replace the R32 with something else in the current system, you tear the old system out of the building and put a new one in, is what I think we've talked about in the past.

717
01:00:37,898 --> 01:00:57,871
You know, when I did the math and assumed $50,000 per piece of equipment for each thing here, it was nearly $1.5 million just to get the current equipment running minus charging it, which makes me shudder a bit at what it would cost to tear these systems out of the schools and put new systems.

718
01:00:57,911 --> 01:01:04,135
I mean, I just, that report is gonna tell us in today's dollars what that would be?

719
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,844
I asked direct time member.

720
01:01:08,964 --> 01:01:15,526
So just for a couple sentences exactly to understand what the assessment at the Andrews will do.

721
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,067
And that was commissioned.

722
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:21,489
I don't think you have a date in this flyer, but this has been months in the making.

723
01:01:21,629 --> 01:01:31,893
So they're doing an assessment obviously to see where the Andrews is that which we then can implement in the rest of our schools that were built about a little bit over two decades ago.

724
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:49,040
and an assessment comparing the cost benefits for replacing the HVAC system with code compliant equipment versus energy efficient versus all electric, including all utility rebates, professional cost estimator will provide a solid estimate for each option and two options in kind replacements.

725
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:56,942
And or number two, heat pump partial electrification replacement is option number two.

726
01:01:57,382 --> 01:02:02,323
And then I just wanted to add that for several months, myself and Director Hunt

727
01:02:02,867 --> 01:02:08,029
And now we're taking the city's building facilities maintenance director.

728
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,889
It's a new position the city hired.

729
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,030
Dr. Cushion's been in the loop.

730
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:18,832
We've been meeting with the Greater Boston Labor Council monthly, along with two to three neighboring communities.

731
01:02:19,332 --> 01:02:22,633
And we're trying to partner with the Greater Boston Labor Council.

732
01:02:23,213 --> 01:02:31,416
And Alicia and I have been pushing at those meetings that the project we apply for the infrastructure money on is systems at the schools.

733
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:46,194
So fingers crossed that we can get this assessment, we can apply it to the Medford Public Schools, join forces with a few other communities, plus the workforce development aspect of what will make the grant very strong with the Greater Boston Labor Council.

734
01:02:46,294 --> 01:02:49,555
And we do have high hopes that we'll be able to get this done.

735
01:02:49,895 --> 01:03:01,160
Unfortunately, and from the chair, I sat in my office last week and just felt completely terrible about what was going on in our schools, getting texts from my daughter and emails from parents.

736
01:03:01,604 --> 01:03:03,346
I know we all felt the same way.

737
01:03:03,406 --> 01:03:08,131
So this is something that is a priority, along with security, along with Medford High School.

738
01:03:08,171 --> 01:03:10,493
There's a number of them, along with the McGlynn Playground.

739
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:15,318
But this is something we are committed to getting done and working towards.

740
01:03:15,478 --> 01:03:21,524
So I just wanted to throw those two cents in, because I asked the same question from Director Hunt earlier today.

741
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:22,465
Thank you very much.

742
01:03:22,751 --> 01:03:40,061
And so to address your first point, I will be completely honest and just say that I don't know how viable any repairs might be based on the age of the systems and that throwing good money after bad.

743
01:03:42,262 --> 01:03:43,503
Yeah, we need new systems.

744
01:03:43,703 --> 01:03:44,683
Yeah.

745
01:03:44,743 --> 01:03:45,884
Member McLaughlin.

746
01:03:46,325 --> 01:03:46,725
Thank you.

747
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:49,066
Yeah, I have two questions comments.

748
01:03:49,086 --> 01:03:51,207
Thank you, Dr cushion for the report.

749
01:03:51,607 --> 01:03:56,329
I'll start with the HVAC situation first and go backwards.

750
01:03:56,789 --> 01:04:04,032
Can you address for the community, how and what remediation efforts have been

751
01:04:04,887 --> 01:04:26,041
applied for helping our students and our teachers and our kids in those settings when it is unbearably hot, so I know that there have been some, I just don't know that the community understands what some of those are specifically and I'm wondering if, if you might be able to share I know that there's been some cooling rooms for example, you know, some of the other

752
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:36,970
examples that you might be able to share of what has been done because, you know, if it continues, hopefully it won't work, you know, coming into the end of September, but we'll probably have a few more hot days.

753
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:43,055
What sorts of things have been happening to help our families and kids and staff?

754
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:46,638
So we purchased 8,000 bottles of water.

755
01:04:46,658 --> 01:04:53,123
We added slush to the menus both Thursday and Friday, thanks to, again, Food Service Director Rhetta Smith.

756
01:04:53,786 --> 01:04:57,687
making sure that those things were added as quickly as possible and then she was delivering them.

757
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:02,748
We had the custodians go around and at night open the windows.

758
01:05:03,628 --> 01:05:13,691
We were planning to run the equipment so you can open the dampers full, all right, and just run the fans and the idea is to suck in outside nighttime air.

759
01:05:14,229 --> 01:05:17,750
The problem is we weren't really able to do that because of the high humidity levels.

760
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:23,751
So it would have sucked high moisture air in that would have, it would have caused us to do it.

761
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:27,492
We, we deployed fans as, as we could, it was limited.

762
01:05:27,512 --> 01:05:34,473
I'm not going to stand here and tell you it was, um, we moved classes, um, as best we could.

763
01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:37,514
There were teachers who reached out to help their peers to say, Hey,

764
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:40,077
I'm in an air conditioned room, I'm free this period.

765
01:05:40,497 --> 01:05:51,705
We also moved our phys ed classes to rather be in a stifling gym, Andrews and McGlynn, to then move them to the auditorium or say it might be better to be outside.

766
01:05:53,266 --> 01:05:54,467
But yeah.

767
01:05:55,968 --> 01:05:56,669
And thank you.

768
01:05:56,889 --> 01:05:59,931
And if there are student, may I follow up there to that?

769
01:06:01,132 --> 01:06:07,517
If there are students and staff for that matter that are experiencing symptoms of heat,

770
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:09,903
illness, heat stroke, anything like that.

771
01:06:11,504 --> 01:06:12,125
What can be done?

772
01:06:12,145 --> 01:06:14,246
I know for myself, I went for a walk on Friday.

773
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:16,608
I did not anticipate coming back in the afternoon.

774
01:06:17,429 --> 01:06:18,930
I came back in the afternoon for the walk.

775
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,252
It was like a five mile walk halfway through the walk.

776
01:06:21,312 --> 01:06:22,914
I honestly didn't think I was gonna make it.

777
01:06:22,954 --> 01:06:30,240
And I started shivering, which is a clear sign that something's wrong if you're shivering in the 90 plus degree heat.

778
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:36,045
So how are we sharing with families and staff and others how to recognize

779
01:06:36,665 --> 01:06:45,011
examples of heat exhaustion, heat stroke, referrals to nursing, like are we doing anything that can help remediate any of that?

780
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:51,075
I know the superintendent did put out a message to the community last week.

781
01:06:51,316 --> 01:07:04,425
Our nurse's office, every single nurse's office is staffed with a minimum of two nurses, save for the Curtis Tufts, so they're available to help families, but I do know the superintendent put out a message last week

782
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,301
as to that as well.

783
01:07:09,723 --> 01:07:09,963
Sorry.

784
01:07:10,423 --> 01:07:20,430
So if there are issues like that, they can go to nursing, let staffing know, go to nursing and nursing should be able to help support our families.

785
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:25,753
They're the best able to assess a student or staff member's health.

786
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:43,053
Yes, and then in addition to for the heat, a lot of the classrooms and hallways used reduced lighting shades down, we recommended kids were loose light fitted clothing, and no one was being encouraged to go outside and like

787
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:46,674
run like you're running in the, you know, running a marathon.

788
01:07:47,095 --> 01:07:52,817
It was really, if they went outside, they could get some fresh air, but not to overexert themselves.

789
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:59,440
But if students didn't feel well, they definitely had access to water to stay hydrated.

790
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:02,722
And if they needed water breaks, they definitely could go and get that.

791
01:08:02,942 --> 01:08:04,683
And then the nurses again were there.

792
01:08:04,763 --> 01:08:07,384
So everyone really tried to

793
01:08:08,849 --> 01:08:12,672
not have the students become overexerted or to overexert themselves.

794
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:17,575
And if that were to happen, the nurses were able to support those students.

795
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:21,338
Thank you, Mayor.

796
01:08:22,059 --> 01:08:22,899
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

797
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:23,260
Thank you.

798
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,841
I just had another question, if I may.

799
01:08:24,861 --> 01:08:26,923
I don't know if there are other colleagues with their lights on.

800
01:08:29,545 --> 01:08:31,026
Graham's right after this question.

801
01:08:31,386 --> 01:08:32,307
Okay, thank you.

802
01:08:33,047 --> 01:08:35,709
The other was the safety protocols,

803
01:08:37,008 --> 01:08:46,773
Going back to that, I know that you mentioned school safety teams and district-wide safety teams have been established, and maybe at some point a municipal safety team, which I think is a good idea.

804
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:59,519
For the safety teams that currently exist, I'm wondering about those students and staff who are sort of outside of the typical box, if you will, and how or whether there are representatives on those safety teams.

805
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:14,092
and district-wide safety teams to address, for example, our English learner population, our students with disabilities, our students with special healthcare needs, you know, thinking about all of those ways to address our varied student population.

806
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:16,333
Are there folks that are... Yeah, absolutely.

807
01:09:16,874 --> 01:09:29,044
On the templates that we've provided, there's room for people to add, but we've also made sure that our director of people and personnel services or, you know, EL coordinator, Mr. Teixeira or others are definitely going to be included in that.

808
01:09:29,454 --> 01:09:33,036
so that we hopefully can minimize any blind spots we may have.

809
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:40,779
Also looking forward to being an active part with the Universal Safety Committee to make sure that we're having those conversations as well.

810
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:41,279
Thank you.

811
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:41,699
Thank you.

812
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:43,840
Member Graham.

813
01:09:45,341 --> 01:09:45,701
Thank you.

814
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:49,823
I'll circle back to HVAC in just a second.

815
01:09:51,095 --> 01:09:54,256
the conversation about the Brooks field.

816
01:09:54,376 --> 01:10:09,843
I just want to reiterate for those of us who are newer to the conversation that when that field was installed, it was after years and years and years of failure of what was supposed to be a place, a green place for kids to play.

817
01:10:09,883 --> 01:10:12,444
And it was actually a brown place for kids to play.

818
01:10:14,045 --> 01:10:16,546
And the PTO made a significant investment in that project.

819
01:10:16,566 --> 01:10:18,347
They did not pay for nearly

820
01:10:19,045 --> 01:10:28,552
anything that led up to the actual like total cost, but they did, they were asked to contribute $15,000 out of their raised funds.

821
01:10:28,852 --> 01:10:38,258
And in doing that, we were promised that that field would be maintained on the same contract that the field of the high school is maintained.

822
01:10:38,779 --> 01:10:45,624
And it seems like maybe we're on a better path to that now, but that predated me being on the committee.

823
01:10:46,044 --> 01:10:47,345
So I've been here for four years.

824
01:10:48,086 --> 01:11:06,089
for more than four years, that field has not been maintained, which means that we are doing it to ourselves again, where we're not maintaining things that are going to be expensive and cause problems like that field five, six years ago, however many years ago it was, it was like $100,000 then.

825
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:10,630
So we can't keep doing this to ourselves.

826
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:14,131
It's not wise financially, it's not good for kids.

827
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:35,440
Um the other thing I will say about that project is we were also promised there was a phase two of that project which was to address um the runoff that comes down the hill so that um our own runoff down the hill did not does not um further deteriorate the field with all the as rainwater washes things off to my knowledge that has never been done.

828
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:42,483
So, my understanding and I could be completely wrong was that we were just waiting in a queue somewhere with the DPW and they

829
01:11:44,389 --> 01:11:51,510
I don't even know if it's on the DPWs list and it's just the list is seven years long and we haven't gotten there, but that hasn't been done.

830
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:56,551
It's gonna continue to run and wash dirt and everything else down the hill.

831
01:11:56,631 --> 01:12:14,115
So it's gonna continue to be a problem, but we have to start doing something differently because this lack of maintenance is just, it's wildly expensive to not maintain big critical pieces of infrastructure.

832
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:18,118
And we just like, we can't, we can't keep doing this.

833
01:12:18,178 --> 01:12:26,426
Like I almost fell out of my chair when I saw that there were 29 failed compressors and more equipment than that, even that is broken.

834
01:12:26,506 --> 01:12:28,348
Like that didn't all break last week.

835
01:12:28,608 --> 01:12:32,552
Like this stuff has been broken like since forever, I'm assuming.

836
01:12:32,652 --> 01:12:40,179
And I don't even know, but I think we have to do a better job of understanding what our maintenance issues is.

837
01:12:40,769 --> 01:12:47,131
are like this committee has been asking this question in a lot of earnest for the entirety of the time I've been here.

838
01:12:47,171 --> 01:12:53,454
Like we've been talking about what's the capital plan, what are the capital needs, like none of that work has happened.

839
01:12:53,494 --> 01:13:05,638
So I'm not, sadly not that surprised that we have 29 failed compressors because we've never had an inventory of like what is the equipment that needs to be maintained and is it being maintained?

840
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:07,059
So we have to
