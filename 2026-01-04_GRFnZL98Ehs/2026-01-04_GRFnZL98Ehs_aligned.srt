1
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,358
If I can have everyone's attention, please.

2
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,139
I'd like everyone to get seated.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,000
We're about to start soon.

4
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:53,661
Trust me, take it off while you can, Chris.

5
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:14,706
250 years ago, I helped organize a quick-on in this world.

6
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:26,270
And I know that as a mother of a Boston teapot and a Bucket Hill, I served a patient conflict, your blessing, for the wounded patriots.

7
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,671
And I also served General Washington.

8
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:32,572
Indeed, I did.

9
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:44,579
My husband, John, was alive with our nine children.

10
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:49,340
He lived near the Pratt Bridge.

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:59,122
John worked at the Hall of Silver, making fine leather clothes.

12
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:07,363
Later, he moved to a football house on Gold Road, Texas.

13
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:16,033
later named my honor as Colton Street.

14
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:23,355
I trust you know that, sir?

15
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:33,938
Later, I now reside, or I am at the same, I now reside, or I am at the same street there as I was.

16
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,458
So it has reached me that,

17
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:42,864
a statue of himself, himself, of a student of the FBI, let him see it all, this brief.

18
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:47,628
I'll keep your attention to the FBI.

19
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:21,440
I am glad that you still have faith in Washington and in Dr. King.

20
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:21,640
Thank you.

21
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you so much.

22
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,901
If I could have everyone please rise so I can admit the school committee.

23
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:33,863
Medford Police Honor Guard.

24
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,209
Mm-hmm.

25
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:11,216
That was the post.

26
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:13,337
That's the interface.

27
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:17,120
Peace out.

28
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,991
Thank you to the Metro Police Honor Guard.

29
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:48,373
At this time, we'd like to admit the school committee.

30
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:51,754
I'm going to start with Jenny R. Graham.

31
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:02,880
Michael Mastrobone.

32
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,205
Aaron J. Olopade.

33
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:20,909
Jessica Parks.

34
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,334
Erica L. Reinfeld.

35
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,719
And Paul R. Russo.

36
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:51,280
If I could have everyone please remain standing so I can admit the members of city council.

37
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,341
First, Back Bears.

38
00:05:54,361 --> 00:06:11,751
Emily Nazaro.

39
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:20,702
Matt Lemming.

40
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,145
Liz Mullane.

41
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:38,928
George Scappelli.

42
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,370
And Justin Tseng.

43
00:06:56,485 --> 00:07:02,489
And please help me in welcoming Honorable Mayor of the City of Medford, Brianna Longo Kern.

44
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:13,877
If I could have everyone please take a seat.

45
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:22,709
So my name is Chris Zuma.

46
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,193
I am the recovery coach here for the city of Medford.

47
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:29,959
And I am also the guy who's going to be making sure that things go from one step to the other through this process.

48
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:35,866
I just want to tell you a little bit about me really quickly, and I'll make it brief.

49
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:39,228
So I'm the recovery coach for the city of Medford.

50
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:42,910
And for anybody who doesn't know what a recovery coach is, I help people when they're addicted.

51
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:46,432
For this job, it requires lived experience.

52
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:49,094
So I am in recovery myself.

53
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:54,217
And today, I just want to share for where I've been and where I'm at.

54
00:07:54,977 --> 00:08:03,559
And when people watch this today and they see somebody that they can relate to, someone who's dealing with substance use disorder, I mean, for me, this is making it.

55
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,301
I mean, there was a time when I couldn't get out of bed.

56
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:09,221
I couldn't function normally.

57
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:12,662
And here I am in front of all of you fine people.

58
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:16,223
And what an honor it is that was bestowed upon me.

59
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:18,104
And I am so grateful to be here.

60
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:21,425
And I'm so honored, beyond honored to be here.

61
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,606
That's just a little bit about my backstory.

62
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:30,370
Obviously, in terms of accomplishments that I've made, you see it right here.

63
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,471
This is one of my greatest accomplishments.

64
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:39,056
I never thought that people that I look up to and admire would welcome me in, in the way that people have.

65
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,837
And it's an amazing thing.

66
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:45,040
And I'm so grateful to be here.

67
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,202
I just wanna make sure that that's said over and over again.

68
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:00,894
I'll tell you, when I came to Medford, I was nervous.

69
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:02,854
And I'm not a guy that normally gets nervous.

70
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,875
I actually love being in front of crowds.

71
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:06,095
I don't know if you guys can tell by that.

72
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:11,076
But I was nervous because I'm embarking on a new adventure.

73
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:12,557
There's new people I have to meet.

74
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:13,537
There's new people.

75
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:16,378
I don't know how they're going to feel about me, if they're going to welcome me in.

76
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:22,360
And I have to say, the city of Medford and everybody in it has been exceptional.

77
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:30,404
From day one, I have been made to feel as though I belonged here and I should have been here years ago.

78
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:31,964
Everybody was welcoming.

79
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:33,525
Everybody was loving, supportive.

80
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:34,566
How can we help?

81
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:35,666
What can we do to help?

82
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:39,728
It just goes to show what a fantastic city Medford is.

83
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:52,801
In terms of the elected officials, I can't speak highly enough about everybody in this room right now.

84
00:09:55,005 --> 00:10:23,093
Obviously coming in here Again, like I said, you know you're in front of people that at one point in my life I would dare to be in front of because they're probably going to try to throw me in jail but today I'm here and I'm welcomed in and first time I came in I remember I met our mayor and Fantastic the way I was welcomed in the ability to

85
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:31,493
use her position to shed light on recovery and what we bring to the table.

86
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:33,995
Super involved in everything.

87
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:42,619
Being welcomed to city council to share the Board of Health, the Prevention and Outreach Department.

88
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:47,662
I mean, I can't stress enough how welcoming everybody has been.

89
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:50,623
And it's amazing to be here.

90
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,944
It's amazing to see everybody here.

91
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:54,759
Okay.

92
00:10:58,142 --> 00:10:59,343
Please let this be all about me.

93
00:10:59,543 --> 00:10:59,763
All right.

94
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:05,647
If I could have everybody please stand for your leaders and the Pledge of Allegiance led by the Medford Scouts.

95
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:33,279
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

96
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,007
You all may be seated.

97
00:11:46,687 --> 00:11:51,692
At this time, I'd like to welcome up Rabbi Jessica Dallara from Temple Shalom to lead an invocation.

98
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:09,228
The greatest sages of the Talmud never worked alone.

99
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,384
They operated in chavruta, an Aramaic which is chaver, meaning friend or peer.

100
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:30,587
Now the best chavruta, a study partner, this is a Jewish tradition that continues to this day, a study partner that you learn with on a regular basis, is not someone who always agrees with you on every issue.

101
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:38,248
In fact, the best chavruta is the one who shows you when you're wrong, who tells you when you've got the wrong end of the stick.

102
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:56,845
There's a line from Mishlei, from Proverbs, that says, barzel b'barzel yachad, iron sharpens iron, and this is the founding principle of learning and seeing the world through the lens of chavruta, principled partnership and opposition.

103
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:07,193
Two of the most famous rabbis of the Mishnaic period, the Talmud, were named Shammai and Hillel,

104
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:15,657
If you've heard of either of them, you've probably heard of Hillel and not Shammai, because Hillel takes precedence, generally.

105
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:24,466
Tractate Erevin of the Talmud says that for three years, Beit Shammai, the students in the tradition of Shammai, and Beit Hillel,

106
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:29,508
the students learning in the tradition of Rabbi Hillel, pressed their arguments.

107
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:36,791
Ultimately, a bat kol, a divine voice, proclaimed, Elu ve'elu divrei elohim chayim.

108
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:39,912
These and those are the words of the living God.

109
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:43,734
However, the ruling is in accordance with Hillel.

110
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:51,017
Now, why does Hillel get this privilege of taking precedence?

111
00:13:51,938 --> 00:14:06,403
He's the one who ruled, many of you may be familiar with the holiday of Hanukkah, that the number of candles should go up from day to day so that the light increases in the world over the course of the day, whereas Shammai went the other way, starting with eight and counting down.

112
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:10,024
The argument being, we always go up in holiness.

113
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,897
So why are the words of Hillel prioritized?

114
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:21,165
Because the students of Hillel were civil and forbearing with each other and with their opponents.

115
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,932
Only their own statements, but those of Shammai as well.

116
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:46,796
This is a tradition that's carried on in Judaism, a multivocal tradition, where the reason the Talmud is so long, it's something almost 3,000 pages long, is because all of the arguments for and against, no matter which ultimately took effect, are recorded, are studied, are thought about, and sharpened.

117
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:48,237
Iron sharpens iron.

118
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:53,841
Now, if you don't have the right chavruta, the one who will tell you,

119
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:55,549
when you're off base.

120
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,191
It can be literally fatal.

121
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:04,636
There's a story also in the Talmud about Rabbi Yochanan and his chavruta Resh Lakish.

122
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:15,625
To spare a long story short, they had a falling out, a careless remark, wounded Resh Lakish, his lifelong chavruta, so badly

123
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:24,969
that they fell out, and despite the pleading of Rabbi Yochanan, who was Reish Lakish's wife, caught in the middle of this, they never reconciled.

124
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:31,231
Reish Lakish got sick and died, and Rabbi Yochanan had to find a new chavruta who was not satisfactory.

125
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:42,136
In every matter, Rabbi Yochanan would speak, and Rabbi Eleazar ben Padat, that's his new chavruta, would say to him, here is a teaching that supports your opinion.

126
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:56,002
Rabbi Yochanan cried out, with Rish Lakish, he would raise 24 difficulties against me, and I would answer him with 24 answers, and the ruling itself would become strengthened.

127
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:07,614
So my wish for our city council, for our school committee, for our mayor, for our city is that we honor multivocality.

128
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:22,160
We are blessed to live in a city of people from many different kinds of backgrounds and many different kinds of opinions that we may always seek out the voices of everyone agree with us already and those who do not agree.

129
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:36,649
who may never agree, and finding value in the exercise, finding value in the iron that sharpens iron of coming together civilly and with forbearance and teaching each other.

130
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:45,514
May we all be the chavruta for each other, the one who helps us sharpen our minds and improve our outcomes.

131
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:46,415
Thank you.

132
00:16:57,147 --> 00:16:59,628
I'd like to introduce the Poet Laureate, Max Hall.

133
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:11,313
Thank you for having me.

134
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:19,497
My poem is called Begin, dedicated to the inauguration.

135
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:22,519
Here we go.

136
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,040
Begin with the new year.

137
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:36,074
matching your mind to the calendar, aligning your readiness and intention, asking for ennobling work in a world that needs it.

138
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:42,480
Begin with what is needed from you and a will that wants resistance.

139
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:48,586
Muscle cannot grow without tearing, nor legacy blossom in shade.

140
00:17:49,912 --> 00:18:00,036
We live now in interesting times where we have normalized fearing the headlines, fearing for neighbors whose diverse beauty creates our city.

141
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:12,982
Begin with yourself, all the love and luck that brought you where you find yourself today, remembering the power one voice wields raised in the service of others.

142
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:24,536
Begin in this room with an oath and an honored promise for the days ahead when you're confident and your ideals emerge as you shape the moment.

143
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:29,719
Begin to see the years ahead as a chance at greatness.

144
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:37,623
What else would this fair city and our miraculous world deserve and be destined for?

145
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:52,468
I'd like to introduce Carmen Catherine Clark to give remarks, please.

146
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:58,029
Thank you.

147
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,509
Thank you all.

148
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:01,830
Happy New Year.

149
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:11,712
And Chris, thank you for starting us off with gratitude and for the rabbi for inspiring words.

150
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:17,433
And I'm going to make a new note to myself to never follow the poet laureate of Medford.

151
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:17,973
Thank you.

152
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,155
Thank you so much, Max, for that.

153
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:32,774
To be here with the citizens of Medford and all of you, friends, families, supporters, and also with our state delegation, Representative DenBarber and our state senator, Pat Jalen.

154
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:34,336
So thank you for joining us.

155
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:48,623
But I am truly pleased to be here with you, Madam Mayor, our city councilors, and school committee members.

156
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:56,149
As a veteran of the Melrose School Committee, I have a special place in my heart for school committee members.

157
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,852
I still think the toughest job in politics.

158
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,455
So we are grateful to all of you.

159
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:10,886
And congratulations to each and every one of you for the city has placed in you.

160
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:16,870
And thank you for stepping up to serve the people of Medford.

161
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:23,955
Public service is alive and well in this city, in the Commonwealth, and in our country.

162
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:31,820
And that people of integrity and compassion and love for their neighbor are still

163
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:38,442
choosing to devote their time and energy to a better future.

164
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:49,865
And despite everything we're seeing on the national stage, we have leaders who still believe that the rule of law isn't a suggestion.

165
00:20:50,625 --> 00:21:02,348
A community that believes quality public education is the right of every child, that climate change is real, that health care and child care

166
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:06,824
and food are more important than billionaires.

167
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:32,857
And we have leaders like Mayor Lungo Kern, who has given decades of service to this community, who guided us through a pandemic, and who is now guiding through Medford through all the chaos that we see coming down from Washington.

168
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:40,560
And we are in a chapter of our history where it seems sometimes that the worst voices are the loudest.

169
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:53,225
But today is a reminder and a reaffirmation that we fight back by building a strong community and a strong city here in Medford.

170
00:21:53,865 --> 00:22:02,729
And while the administration dismantles the Department of Education, we will continue to do right by our children and invest in Medford schools.

171
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:14,826
While our immigrant neighbors are terrorized, we will continue to stand with them.

172
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:26,017
And while our families struggle to get by, we will prove what we know to be true, that in the end, greed and cruelty lose.

173
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:30,099
And in the end, it is justice that endures.

174
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,621
And I am so grateful to be your partner in governing.

175
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:38,682
I thank you for to stand up and put your name on the ballot.

176
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:41,044
I thank you for choosing to serve.

177
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:47,226
And I thank you for choosing to fight for a future that is of all our children.

178
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:50,848
Congratulations again, and thank you for having me.

179
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:01,269
If it's OK, I'm going to go a little off script for a second.

180
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,171
Congresswoman, you mentioned gratitude.

181
00:23:05,892 --> 00:23:08,433
Gratitude, in my opinion, is the cheat code to a happy life.

182
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:14,677
And what I mean by that is if we can turn our thoughts into positive thinking, gratitude just happens to come.

183
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:19,400
And I tell everybody, if we can focus on the positive, we're going to find the positive.

184
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,141
Because our thoughts become our beliefs.

185
00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:24,463
Our beliefs become our behaviors.

186
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:26,604
Our behaviors become our habits.

187
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:31,206
become our character, and our character determines our destiny.

188
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:36,568
And if we can start our day with a little bit of gratitude, there's a positive outlook right around the corner.

189
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,792
I'd like to introduce City Council Member Zach Bares to give remarks, please.

190
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:05,823
I know you weren't expecting to hear from me and add yet another speech to our program, so I promise I'll try to be brief.

191
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:12,165
I want to thank the mayor for accepting my request to make sure that the city council was represented today.

192
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:22,570
I want to thank everyone who's spoken so far for bringing light into this space in an hour that I think many of us feel has been dark, especially the last couple of days.

193
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,831
And I want to thank all of you for being here and joining us.

194
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:33,698
We gather in these chambers once again at the start of this new year, filled with new possibilities for our beloved city.

195
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:42,942
In recent months, I've been reflecting on how much we all share, our pride in Medford, and how meaningful it is that we've each chosen to build our lives and our futures here.

196
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:48,236
our desire for a city government of excellence and lives up to that expectation.

197
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:57,638
Government that's not just a safety net, but a launching pad for us to do great things, both big and small, to make life better for all of us who call Medford home.

198
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:08,861
These past few years, I've heard from too many people who say they've lost faith, who feel that we stand too far apart, who feel alienated from their neighbors,

199
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:15,805
who aren't sure that we can come together and be excellent and do great things if we can't trust.

200
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:23,970
Yet I stand here today with hope for renewal, hope for reconnection, hope that we can restore faith in our city and our council.

201
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:37,419
It's up to each of us, especially our elected leaders, to reflect and act on the responsibility we share to make city government a place where we each have faith that by working together, our hopes can be made real.

202
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,423
I'm happy to announce that the city council will begin holding regular neighborhood ward meetings to hear directly from residents.

203
00:25:50,263 --> 00:26:02,468
This expands on the great work that Anna, Emily, Matt, and Justin did last term on the resident services and public engagement committee by establishing our city council listening sessions and council newsletter and so much more.

204
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:11,752
And I'm even more excited to announce that George and I will work in partnership on that effort along with the entire council and our newest colleague, councilor Liz Mullane.

205
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:31,913
I will work my hardest to center compassion for our community at the heart of my work, because for each other, and at the very least, hear each other out with an open heart, even across our biggest differences and disagreements.

206
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:41,862
That's the foundation of what it means to be proud of our city, of what allows us to strive for excellence, of how we work to restore faith in our city and in each other.

207
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:51,287
We have great projects to accomplish for Medford over these next two years, especially our new Medford High School that we're about to hear about from member Graham.

208
00:26:52,668 --> 00:26:54,310
And we must come together to achieve them.

209
00:26:55,371 --> 00:27:00,156
I will bring my deepest well of compassion and dedication to seeing those accomplishments become reality.

210
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:02,819
And I welcome every neighbor to walk that path together.

211
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:03,440
Thank you.

212
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:16,921
I'd like to welcome school committee member Jenny Graham to give an update on Medford High School.

213
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:31,432
Hello everyone.

214
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:39,617
for asking me to speak today, and for all the work that we've done together for the last six years.

215
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:46,243
It feels like the longest and shortest six years of my life, as many of you know.

216
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:54,249
I never really set out to be a politician, and I still don't think that quite fits what I would call myself, but I'll talk a little bit about the high school.

217
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:02,253
In my first campaign, my palm card said, develop a comprehensive and holistic plan to address the future of each of our school buildings.

218
00:28:02,753 --> 00:28:06,374
See the first go around, you walk some fine lines because you want to be elected.

219
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:09,235
I guess I am a politician after all.

220
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:15,437
In that first year, I also said something like, work for increased and fair funding for our schools.

221
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:17,258
Today, I'd be more direct.

222
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:21,539
We need a new Medford High School, and our schools are underfunded and need more.

223
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:23,620
So that's my six years ago.

224
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:39,004
But what I've learned along the way is people appreciate that directness, and people appreciate people who will stand up and say, there's something wrong, and we have to fix it.

225
00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:43,889
Scott and I have lived here for 10 years, and we are new by some standards.

226
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:48,493
And we have been welcomed by many people who have been here much, much longer than us.

227
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:53,919
And when our kids were very young, we had to go to Medford High School, and it was stunning.

228
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,381
Like I stepped back in time.

229
00:28:57,062 --> 00:29:02,547
So I feel like I stepped further back in time than even my high school, and I graduated in 1995.

230
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:07,972
My high school felt more modern in my memory than what I was looking at in Medford High School.

231
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:14,418
And it actually gave me pause to say, is this really the place for us for the long term?

232
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:21,595
And then, you know, we put our kids in school and we got to know our neighbors and we're like, yes, this is the place for us.

233
00:29:22,276 --> 00:29:26,618
But wow, high school still looked like a relic.

234
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:29,180
And I kept hoping that somebody

235
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:32,665
would do something to fix it.

236
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:34,567
So fast forward, here we are.

237
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:37,289
Apparently, I'm one of the somebodies who would do something.

238
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:42,435
And I'm super excited because we're finally getting to do something.

239
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:48,541
For the record, the list of volunteers and the somebodies who are going to do something is in the hundreds at this point.

240
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:51,784
It's becoming a very long spreadsheet that will get longer as we go.

241
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:56,427
In 2022, we submitted a bid to the MSBA and we were finalists.

242
00:29:57,187 --> 00:30:04,170
But because of record inflation and the number of programs that were competing for a limited amount of money, we did not proceed, we did not go forward.

243
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,711
In 2023, we did it again and we got in.

244
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:11,052
So I was like, yes, as the kids say, let's go.

245
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:16,835
But then we learned that this process is a process.

246
00:30:17,595 --> 00:30:21,039
And the MSBA takes its role as stewards of taxpayer dollars really seriously.

247
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:30,971
So we've worked alongside them through the process, which is tedious at times, but we push, and I'm pushy, and we want to move fast because that's what our kids deserve.

248
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:41,733
As the chair, we have found a bunch of equally pushy people willing to push through these initial phases just as fast as we can because this community values action.

249
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,276
In this instance, though, paperwork comes first.

250
00:30:44,716 --> 00:30:48,620
So that's what we've been up to for the last two years and what feels like an eternity.

251
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:53,345
I am thrilled, though, to say that we're on the paperwork phase really rapidly.

252
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,388
We've hired a project management company and an architect.

253
00:30:56,968 --> 00:31:08,815
They're on board and they're working hard and fast to explore the site, to understand, to talk to our educators, hundreds of them, and ask our educators to tell us what we want to do in this new building.

254
00:31:09,675 --> 00:31:18,280
Based on all the nation, the architects will be presenting initial concepts this month to our building committee, which will be held, I believe, on January 14th.

255
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,061
It's a Wednesday.

256
00:31:20,842 --> 00:31:23,183
What I've been told is that those will be like

257
00:31:24,794 --> 00:31:28,275
circles and shapes of where things might be on the property.

258
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:33,016
So I think they want us to understand that this is a very beginning step.

259
00:31:34,396 --> 00:31:36,617
But we'll have initial cost estimates in February.

260
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:41,078
And by June, we will have a design that will move forward.

261
00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:46,379
So although the paperwork seems to have taken an eternity, we're ready to move really quickly.

262
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:54,767
I put out my own newsletter a couple of days ago that outlined some of these important steps in some more detail over the course of the next three months in particular.

263
00:31:55,727 --> 00:32:04,509
Please do tune into those opportunities to participate and provide input because this is a transformative that should have something for literally everyone in this city.

264
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:12,431
This includes enhancing education for our students, making our vocational student services more available to the community and our seniors at large.

265
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:21,535
preserving the pool, increasing the amount of field space that's available to our community sports teams, and creating a theater space that properly houses the arts we're so proud of.

266
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:27,278
To my fellow elected officials being inducted today, welcome to the project.

267
00:32:27,758 --> 00:32:29,499
There is nowhere to hide.

268
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:34,682
And this project is going to take all of us.

269
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:36,263
I'm asking for your help.

270
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:45,342
to make sure that we hear from all corners of our community and that we work together, despite how we may disagree, to bring this project to fruition.

271
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:53,024
We need to work together to maximize our state reimbursement for the project and to create revenue streams that alleviate the project's cost for our residents.

272
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:58,266
A state grant to pay for half of the total cost is a good start, but we can do more.

273
00:32:58,646 --> 00:32:59,807
This project is for Medford.

274
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,088
and the road ahead will depend on all of us.

275
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:04,869
Since this is my fourth inauguration, I'll be direct.

276
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:12,633
In the spring of 2027, we will need to work together to pass a debt exclusion to pay for our share of the high school project possible.

277
00:33:13,193 --> 00:33:13,813
That will be us.

278
00:33:14,774 --> 00:33:18,255
I'll be calling on each of you to participate at every step and make sure that we get this done.

279
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:27,920
I'm also super excited to announce that we've secured three MSBA grants to replace our roof and HVAC systems at the Roberts, the Missittuck, and the Brooks.

280
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:32,562
Just like the McGlynn and the Andrews, these systems are old.

281
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:35,785
They're at the end of their life and they require replacement.

282
00:33:36,286 --> 00:33:39,069
These grants will pay for more than half of each project.

283
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,114
So in a few short years, we'll have modernized systems and a new high school.

284
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:59,706
And maybe we can finally stop talking about the internet at Medford High, which I know would be a welcome change to the educators and the students who spend a lot of time there.

285
00:34:01,947 --> 00:34:09,790
So all those listening here in person, online, or later, if you'd like to watch public access television, please reach out any time.

286
00:34:10,511 --> 00:34:13,392
I take my role as an elected officiator seriously, and I care what's on your mind.

287
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:16,533
Let's do this together, because for sure.

288
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:18,214
Sorry.

289
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:20,575
That's the best way forward.

290
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:21,095
Thanks.

291
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:42,655
So I just wanted to say, you know how they say that when you get married, if it rains, that's supposed to be good luck?

292
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:47,757
Well, if you have an inauguration two times in a row and it snows, what does that mean?

293
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:51,778
Something's telling me we made the right choice, so fantastic.

294
00:34:54,459 --> 00:35:02,562
At this time, I'd like to welcome up Bailey Kern to deliver the oath of office to Honorable Mayor Brianna Lunga.

295
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,931
I was going to say, you see that?

296
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:21,699
Class.

297
00:35:29,445 --> 00:35:30,466
I, state your name.

298
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:32,027
I, Brianna Lungo Kern.

299
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:39,415
do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as Mayor of the City of Medford.

300
00:35:48,418 --> 00:36:00,089
according to the best of my ability, and understanding, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, the laws of this Commonwealth, and the ordinances of the City of Medford.

301
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:24,184
Thank you, great job, great job.

302
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:34,515
Congresswoman Clark, our state delegation, city council, school committee, my mother and father.

303
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:41,422
Good morning and thank you for coming to the 2026 Medford inauguration.

304
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,501
will be my state of the city too, so bear with me.

305
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:48,523
I do want to get a lot in, and it's not everything.

306
00:36:48,563 --> 00:36:53,527
But I hope you've enjoyed our program so far this morning as much as I have.

307
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:58,410
Thank you to Chris Sumer, our recovery coach, for bringing such energy to the hosting duties.

308
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,873
Thank you to our newest poet laureate, Max Heinig, for his inspiring words, and Rabbi Jessica.

309
00:37:05,854 --> 00:37:13,417
Congresswoman Clark for sharing your perspectives and all that you do for us and the state, and everyone who's making this ceremony possible.

310
00:37:14,597 --> 00:37:27,461
Thank you to the team who planned this event, led by our Community Relations Director, Lisa Coliani, and Director of Communications, Steve Smerdy, and my Chief of Staff, who both are here, who helped me write this speech.

311
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:40,159
I also want to take this opportunity to recognize the tireless work of our department heads, city staff, and volunteers who have continued to do so many amazing things despite the challenges that emerge from running a city.

312
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:47,354
The people who work here are some of the brightest and most dedicated people I've had the pleasure of working with.

313
00:37:48,074 --> 00:37:53,515
So to everyone who works in this building and for the city as a whole, thank you for making Medford such a special place.

314
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:59,396
What makes Medford so special can also make it challenging at times for us electeds and us managers.

315
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:07,378
We're all passionate about our community, making it more sustainable, making it more affordable and making it more resilient for our future.

316
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:09,418
But we are not perfect.

317
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:12,698
Public service is not for the thin.

318
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:16,021
It's hard and it's grueling and it takes a toll.

319
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:24,969
But doing the hard work and making the hard decisions that you hope are the best decisions, and it's something we never take for granted.

320
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,733
There is a privilege in doing something hard and taking the criticism.

321
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:36,119
There's a privilege in adjusting your look, listening to other voices and pivoting your view based on new information.

322
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,671
There is a privilege in being tasked with guiding a community.

323
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:46,332
For those getting inaugurated for another term, I know you share this with me.

324
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:52,454
You wouldn't go the process of governing and campaigning again without having a deep desire.

325
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:59,595
To those of you here for the first time, please cherish this moment and realize what is being bestowed upon you as an elected leader.

326
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:01,576
Congratulations.

327
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:14,574
Enjoy this day, cherish the road that brought you to this point, and never lose sight of the ultimate goal, serving all of the people of Medford with pride, purpose, and professionalism.

328
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:21,400
I'm excited to continue the relationships with those reelected and forge new partnerships with those for the first time.

329
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:29,207
We have a lot of hard work to do, but I have faith in this group, and I look forward to moving Medford forward together with you all.

330
00:39:31,393 --> 00:39:36,311
For more than four decades, Medford has been governed by a city charter that no longer reflected who we are.

331
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:40,483
how we operate as a modern growing community.

332
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:48,267
Written 40 years ago, our charter had become increasingly out of step with the needs of residents, city staff, and elected officials alike.

333
00:39:49,188 --> 00:40:00,955
As early as 2016, when I took my first vote as a city councilor to review the charter, I believe strongly that Medford deserved a governing document that was transparent, representative, and built for the future.

334
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:19,515
Finally, together, our residents, our city council, our school committee, our state delegation, the Collins Center, myself, and most importantly, the Charter Task Force, advanced a charter that modernizes Medford's governance while respecting our values and traditions.

335
00:40:20,515 --> 00:40:28,157
This included changes to council representation, mayoral term limits and lengths, and the overall structure of city government.

336
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:36,666
Thank you so much to the voters for recognizing the need to revamp the charter and sharing in our vision for a document that better serves our community.

337
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:47,531
As we reflect on the progress we've made together, few conversations about the future of our city are as important as the work underway to update Medford zoning.

338
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:56,235
Zoning shapes not just what we build, but how we live, how our corridors grow and how our community adapts to opportunities and challenges.

339
00:40:57,675 --> 00:41:02,296
This comprehensive review is essential to guiding Medford into the next decade and beyond.

340
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:06,677
That said, the journey has not been without its challenges.

341
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:14,978
The speed and scope were outpacing the capacity of our residents and staff, and we needed to refocus our efforts on better communication and public trust.

342
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:22,680
Thank you to the Medford City Council for collaborating with me on a path forward that puts our community first in this process.

343
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:38,915
We are extending our contract with the Innis Land Group to continue work through May 2026 on critical areas, including Medford Square, Tufts Institution, and Boston Avenue, while clearing the way for a broader request for proposals to be put out in March of 2026.

344
00:41:41,697 --> 00:41:46,822
As with all the work we do, we remain committed to open and transparent communication with the public.

345
00:41:47,662 --> 00:41:54,667
We know our responsibility on all issues, including rezoning, is to lead with honesty, accountability, and accountability no matter what.

346
00:41:57,169 --> 00:42:01,592
After years of careful planning, we have taken a major step towards revitalizing Medford Square.

347
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:12,440
The city has selected Transcom Rail Estate as our partner in transforming three underutilized city-owned parcels behind City Hall into a vibrant mixed-use destination.

348
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:20,957
This project will create a true village square atmosphere and ensure ample parking for our seniors and patrons of the Chevalier Theater.

349
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:25,079
Transom's proposal reflects the values we share as a city.

350
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:37,508
It includes both market rate and affordable housing anchored by 13,500 square foot grocery store across from our senior center and designed with pedestrian access and safety at the center.

351
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:42,611
It is a vision that aligns with the comprehensive plan and advances the goals laid out in our RFP.

352
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:47,236
Medford Square that is walkable, welcoming, and filled with opportunity.

353
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:53,537
As we activate the square, we are reconnecting our city to one of the greatest natural assets.

354
00:42:53,757 --> 00:43:03,658
This past summer, the Clippership Connector opened, linking more than 10 miles of continuous waterfront greenways and inviting residents and visitors of Medford in a new way.

355
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:07,199
We are already seeing the results of this renewed energy.

356
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:12,860
The opening of the Great American Beer Hall has created a new regional strengthening in our commercial tax base,

357
00:43:13,573 --> 00:43:15,093
and brought new life to Mystic Avenue.

358
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:20,215
We finally have a coffee shop in Medford Square and another new one in West Medford.

359
00:43:20,575 --> 00:43:27,057
Yet as we grow, we remain aware of the challenges those successes can bring, namely as it relates to affordable housing.

360
00:43:28,557 --> 00:43:32,278
Medford is confronting a housing crisis that is shared across the region and the nation.

361
00:43:33,379 --> 00:43:37,640
We are meeting it head on with a comprehensive approach that includes new funding tools,

362
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:43,520
zoning reform, work from our affordable housing trust, and stronger development partnerships.

363
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:58,265
Through firm negotiations, we secured tangible community benefits from our two 40B projects, safer streets, better transit access, more open space, and more affordable homes prioritized for Medford residents.

364
00:43:59,605 --> 00:44:03,767
I'm thrilled to see that both of these projects have shovels in the ground and are on their way to being built.

365
00:44:04,738 --> 00:44:09,986
Those two projects alone will bring in 161 affordable units to Medford.

366
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:12,670
And we are ensuring that no one is left behind.

367
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:15,054
Our commitment to veterans is unwavering.

368
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:18,139
To many veterans facing housing instability,

369
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:29,210
Through a meaningful partnership with our office, our city, the Veterans Service Office, American Post Legion 45, Suffolk Construction, we are taking a critical step.

370
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:41,959
Together we are working to transform the American Legion site at 321 Winthrop Street into transitional housing that will provide veterans with stability and a clear path forward towards permanent housing.

371
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:45,249
This effort reflects the best of Medford.

372
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:54,034
Suffolk Construction has stepped up to fund a full feasibility study for the project and committed an additional $15,000 in facility upgrades.

373
00:44:55,034 --> 00:45:01,018
Through a community fund grant, the city is investing alongside them to ensure this project moves forward with care and intention.

374
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:07,141
That is what true public-private partnership looks like, shared responsibility, shared purpose, and shared impact.

375
00:45:09,325 --> 00:45:11,887
As our city grows, so does activity in our neighborhoods.

376
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:19,412
New residential and commercial projects bring new energy, new foot traffic, and inevitably more vehicles on our streets.

377
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:25,997
Growing demands that we plan not just for today, but for how people move safely and efficiently through Medford tomorrow.

378
00:45:26,797 --> 00:45:32,021
That is why we are making deliberate investments to improve traffic flow and create safer streets across our community.

379
00:45:32,853 --> 00:45:43,516
Through our complete streets initiatives in places like Haines Square and Riverside Avenue, we are redesigning roadways to better serve every driver, cyclist, pedestrians, and transit users alike.

380
00:45:44,796 --> 00:45:53,299
In collaboration with MassDOT, our state delegation, and the city council, we've advanced plans to reconstruct high crash intersections along Main Street.

381
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:57,420
I want to thank our traffic and transportation team for leading this work.

382
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:00,143
and for expanding blue bikes across the city.

383
00:46:00,984 --> 00:46:09,073
We now have 16 stations making sustainable transportation more accessible than ever, with the hope of opening three more in 2026.

384
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:13,958
Safe, well-designed streets are not just a transportation priority.

385
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:17,442
They are central to our development goals and to the safety of our neighborhoods.

386
00:46:18,168 --> 00:46:22,351
To support that vision, we are investing in the basics, our roads and sidewalks.

387
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:31,118
With the dedication of our engineering team and Department of Public Works, we are making steady progress, although slow, on the decades of backlog.

388
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:39,984
This year, we invested hundreds of thousands in sidewalks repairs and completed patchwork improvements on seven of our more heavily traveled roads.

389
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:47,390
We have significant sidewalk repair on Salem Street, Park Street, and at the intersection of Spring and Central Avenue, just to name a few.

390
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:58,197
We are also investing in our urban canopy and neighborhood appearance, removing nearly 400 tree stumps in 2025 and planting 200 new trees once again.

391
00:46:59,257 --> 00:47:03,219
Thanks to this amazing work, we now have less than 100 stumps left on our current list.

392
00:47:03,919 --> 00:47:05,520
We have not seen a number this low since 2009.

393
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:15,045
We have also made targeted investments in the facilities at both Andrews and McGlynn to ensure our buildings support safe and conducive learning environments.

394
00:47:16,198 --> 00:47:26,927
We are beginning the work thanks to a second MSBA grant on the roofs at Missitech, Roberts, and Brooks, another $20 to $25 million undertaking that the state will help fund.

395
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:33,653
These investments are essential to maintaining strong, reliable school buildings, value we place on education in Medford.

396
00:47:34,654 --> 00:47:54,682
and as you just heard from member graham we are at the forefront of transforming our high school and into an innovative and state-of-the-art best equipped to shape the young minds that will enter its halls this effort is now in the feasibility study phase of the msba process in the months ahead the school committee building committee

397
00:47:55,163 --> 00:48:03,548
which I'm proud to serve on, will begin exploring design options that reflect not only the needs of our students, but the values and aspirations of the entire Medford community.

398
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:06,850
This will remain an open and transparent process.

399
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:13,414
Residents will be invited, continue to be invited to share their perspectives in our community forums throughout 2026.

400
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:20,258
This is how we build a Medford that honors its present and invest boldly in its future together.

401
00:48:21,578 --> 00:48:25,760
Some of the most valuable resources we have here in Medford are extensive green spaces.

402
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:44,347
As we continually work to maintain and improve these areas, the largest projects is Carr Park, which, thanks to Congresswoman Clark for the very healthy grant, entered its first phase, and we will break ground on the second phase, or actually third phase, in the spring.

403
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:56,495
Other projects around our parks include resurfacing the basketball court and upgrading the splash pad at Capen Park, adding a natural play area at Logan Park, shade improvements at Riverside Plaza, and much more.

404
00:48:57,195 --> 00:49:00,777
This is truly a team effort with many departments collaborating on these projects.

405
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:08,607
including Medford Recreation, Procurement, Finance, CPA, DPW, and PDS who has taken the lead.

406
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:18,514
Over the past year, we've been taking a closer look at how people get around Medford and what obstacles may be in place when trying to find your way through the city.

407
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:32,837
Working with Mass Development and the design firm Over Under, we kicked off a citywide effort to improve our wayfinding so it's clearer, accessible, and more consistent, and more welcoming for residents, visitors, and businesses alike.

408
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:40,659
The next step is refining these designs with the hope that project is finalized early next year.

409
00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:53,718
We're also making sure accessibility is front and center by working with the Institute for Human-Centered Design to review and draft sign types and host a focus group with people who bring a wide range of user perspectives.

410
00:49:55,159 --> 00:50:00,160
At the end of the day, this is about making Medford easier to navigate and more welcoming for everyone who spends time here.

411
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:08,202
To better prepare our city for the future, we are continuously working to expand sustainable and climate-focused goals.

412
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:20,346
Using the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan as our framework, we're laying out our strategies to reduce our energy and waste consumption throughout the community and mitigate the impending effects of climate change.

413
00:50:21,347 --> 00:50:25,272
Composting is a key way to reach our climate goals through sustainable waste management.

414
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:33,508
Our curbside composting program with Garbage to Garden has been an enormous success, so 8,000 active households participating now.

415
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:39,395
We're innovators in the space and have been highlighted by both regional and national agencies for our efforts.

416
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:45,161
Expanding our composting program is essential to reducing the amount of waste we produce as a community.

417
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:57,947
Recently, we secured $200,000 from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to bolster waste reduction efforts and put us on to adjusting our trash collection strategy in July of 2027.

418
00:50:59,368 --> 00:51:00,348
I know you've heard about this.

419
00:51:00,968 --> 00:51:06,490
Trash is a personal topic, and I know everyone has an opinion on how we should move forward.

420
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:11,732
We will continue with our community listening to all of the data and adjust our plans accordingly.

421
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:22,752
Our new Keep Medford Beautiful chapter is another way we're keeping the city clean, accountability through action, and foster social responsibility for our public spaces.

422
00:51:23,493 --> 00:51:34,061
We have formed a committee who will help coordinate more neighborhood-centric cleanups and develop more ideas and plans on how we can help to beautify our downtowns and open spaces.

423
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,663
So look for more information this spring.

424
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:47,336
Our latest Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Grant for $750,000 is currently funding our MedforConnects program led by our Office of Prevention and Outreach.

425
00:51:47,996 --> 00:52:00,502
This program connects vulnerable residents to essential city resources and funds a wide variety of programs and events throughout the city, including our amazing multilingual and multicultural community engagement team.

426
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:15,673
Another way in which we are working for underserved communities through a $300,000 grant from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center to create our Electrify Medford program, which aims to strengthen outreach and support for vulnerable communities.

427
00:52:16,654 --> 00:52:19,317
Our goal is to make sustainable to all Medford residents.

428
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:33,323
Medford is participating in the mass CEC on street charging program, which looks to reduce barriers to electric vehicle adoption for renters and residents without a dedicated driveway garage or parking space.

429
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:39,205
Additionally, the city owns 11 operational level two charging stations and plans to add more.

430
00:52:40,326 --> 00:52:43,907
We are also committed to making our facilities as accessible for the public as possible.

431
00:52:45,177 --> 00:53:01,684
I want to thank our facilities team, our school leadership team, and our DEI director for coordinating ADA projects at the McGlynn Middle School and here at City Hall that will help make the experience of interacting with public spaces more inclusive and efficient.

432
00:53:02,884 --> 00:53:03,725
I'm almost done, sorry.

433
00:53:05,638 --> 00:53:11,182
None of this work happens without the dedicated people who show up every day at City Hall to serve this community.

434
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:19,547
Real progress only happens when you have the right people in place, people who lead with integrity and are united around a shared purpose.

435
00:53:20,308 --> 00:53:23,470
That's been a core focus of my administration from day one.

436
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:34,878
Changing culture is never easy and it doesn't happen overnight, but we're doing it one day at a time, one department at a time, leading by example and making decisions on what's best for you,

437
00:53:35,993 --> 00:53:36,873
people of Medford.

438
00:53:37,674 --> 00:53:45,718
Despite the noise, we are deeply committed to those values, and I'm proud to say that nearly everyone across City Hall shares that commitment.

439
00:53:46,338 --> 00:53:48,179
That's why we're able to get so much work done.

440
00:53:49,199 --> 00:54:03,666
We've also made important leadership moves to strengthen our operations, including hiring our interim superintendent, Suzanne Galluzzi, our new elections manager, promoting Chief Evans to our permanent fire chief,

441
00:54:04,934 --> 00:54:07,995
and hiring a new facilities maintenance director who starts in a couple of weeks.

442
00:54:09,295 --> 00:54:10,675
And the results speak for themselves.

443
00:54:11,135 --> 00:54:17,497
Our 2026 budget earned the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award from the Government Finance Office yet again.

444
00:54:18,197 --> 00:54:24,958
Our community relations continue to grow from Lunar New Year to PorchFest, Run Medford, and so many others.

445
00:54:25,678 --> 00:54:33,920
Our arts scene is thriving, including our inclusionary programming is expanding, and community participation has never been stronger.

446
00:54:34,932 --> 00:54:37,874
Thank you to everyone inside City who make this work possible.

447
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,016
I could keep going, but I'm not going to.

448
00:54:42,497 --> 00:54:42,938
Last page.

449
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:51,624
Thank you to the City Council and the School Committee for all the important hard work you do each day to improve the lives of our students, our staff, and our residents.

450
00:54:52,505 --> 00:54:59,690
Medford is lucky to have such caring, hardworking individuals leading their city, and I look forward to continuing this progress alongside you.

451
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:14,286
Thoughtful collaboration is the key to unlocking the city's potential, and while each new term is brought with it to tremendous partnerships, there's always an opportunity to strengthen our relationships, forge new ideas, and bring our city even closer together.

452
00:55:15,384 --> 00:55:17,345
to include life to serve as your mayor.

453
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:18,966
This is my home.

454
00:55:19,307 --> 00:55:21,548
It's where I choose to raise my family.

455
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,510
It's where I chose to start a business and grow my career.

456
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:25,631
Thank you to my family.

457
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:37,918
I saw my husband pop in after hockey in the back, my daughter, Bailey, Cody, and Calloway, who are at hockey, my parents, Ed and Sue, for your support, your understanding, no matter what the day may bring.

458
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:43,748
To conclude, I'll never take this job or the trust you've all put in my team for granted.

459
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:49,578
I can't wait to continue this work and deliver even more success for everyone who calls Medford home.

460
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:50,379
Thank you.

461
00:56:19,382 --> 00:56:25,103
All right, at this time, I'd like to welcome Assistant City Clerk Rich Alicio to administer the oath of office to city council members.

462
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:31,864
Thank you, everyone.

463
00:56:31,904 --> 00:56:32,265
Thank you, Chris.

464
00:56:34,585 --> 00:56:36,145
Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.

465
00:56:37,946 --> 00:56:39,206
I do solemnly affirm

466
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:55,222
that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties encumbered upon me as a member of the Medford City Council.

467
00:56:58,044 --> 00:57:07,971
According to the best of my ability, understanding, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution,

468
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:18,155
the laws of this commonwealth, and the ordinances of the city of Medford.

469
00:57:19,816 --> 00:57:20,497
Congratulations.

470
00:57:40,437 --> 00:57:43,435
At this time, I'd like to welcome Stacey Clayton, who will be singing a song.

471
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:33,730
You're broken down and tired Of living life on a merry-go-round And you can't find the fighter

472
00:58:35,282 --> 00:58:44,848
But I see it in you and we're gonna work it out and move mountains.

473
00:58:45,408 --> 00:58:52,692
We're gonna work it out and move mountains.

474
00:58:54,213 --> 00:59:07,667
And I'll rise up, I'll rise like the day I'll rise up, I'll rise unafraid I'll rise up, and I'll do it a thousand times again

475
00:59:10,782 --> 00:59:34,895
I'll rise up High as the waves I'll rise up In spite of the ache I'll rise up And I'll do it a thousand times again For you For you For you For you

476
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:50,485
When the silence isn't quiet and it feels like it's getting hard to breathe.

477
00:59:51,346 --> 01:00:05,958
And I know you feel like dying, but I promise you I'll take the world to its feet and move mountains.

478
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:10,202
We'll bring it to its feet and move mountains.

479
01:00:12,983 --> 01:00:15,285
mountains.

480
01:00:15,905 --> 01:00:17,766
And I'll rise up.

481
01:00:18,426 --> 01:00:20,447
I'll rise like the day.

482
01:00:20,627 --> 01:00:24,509
I'll rise up in spite of the ache.

483
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:31,693
I'll rise up and I'll do it a thousand times again.

484
01:00:32,374 --> 01:00:35,475
For you.

485
01:00:36,296 --> 01:00:36,656
For you.

486
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,253
For you, for you.

487
01:00:49,064 --> 01:00:53,266
All we need, all we need is hope.

488
01:00:54,186 --> 01:00:56,827
And for that we have each other.

489
01:00:57,827 --> 01:01:01,028
And for that we have each other.

490
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,749
And we will rise.

491
01:01:05,069 --> 01:01:06,390
We will rise.

492
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:12,112
We will rise.

493
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:12,172
Oh.

494
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:21,419
Yes, we'll rise up, rise like the day.

495
01:01:21,479 --> 01:01:25,340
We'll rise up in spite of the ache.

496
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:32,542
We'll rise up, and we'll do it 1,000 times again.

497
01:01:32,942 --> 01:01:35,582
You're high as the waves.

498
01:01:35,622 --> 01:01:39,563
We'll rise up in spite of the ache.

499
01:01:39,603 --> 01:01:44,484
We'll rise up, and we'll do it 1,000 times again.

500
01:01:47,726 --> 01:01:52,392
For you For you For you For you

501
01:02:32,973 --> 01:02:34,914
I have to say, what a beautiful song that was.

502
01:02:34,934 --> 01:02:35,554
That was amazing.

503
01:02:35,754 --> 01:02:36,374
Fantastic.

504
01:02:38,275 --> 01:02:42,616
At this time, I'd like to welcome back Rich Alicio to administer the oath of office to school committee members.

505
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:46,197
Thank you.

506
01:02:46,357 --> 01:02:47,077
School committee, please rise.

507
01:02:49,138 --> 01:02:50,638
Please raise your right hand and repeat after me.

508
01:02:51,979 --> 01:03:02,682
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me

509
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:27,796
as a member of the Medford School Committee, according to the best of my ability and understanding, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, the laws of this Commonwealth, and the ordinances of the city of Medford.

510
01:03:30,357 --> 01:03:31,017
Congratulations.

511
01:03:50,438 --> 01:03:54,431
At this time, I'd like to welcome back Rabbi Jerome, who will lead us in the closing prayer.

512
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:10,067
This is a prayer called Tefilat Medina, which is usually translated as a prayer for our country.

513
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:16,074
But the word Medina can also mean the city that we live in.

514
01:04:16,975 --> 01:04:22,983
This is a piece written by my hometown rabbi, Rabbi Mark Bloom of Temple Beth Abraham in Oakland, California.

515
01:04:25,637 --> 01:04:33,521
Our God and God of our ancestors, we ask you to bless our city, its government, its leaders, its citizens, and its land.

516
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:45,947
We offer a prayer of gratitude for the precious gift of living in a place lived with sublime physical beauty, individual freedom, economic abundance, and a rich, magnificent history.

517
01:04:47,428 --> 01:04:53,251
We offer a prayer of thanksgiving for those who came before us, those whose sacrifices create a nation.

518
01:04:54,773 --> 01:04:58,135
We acknowledge that there are those in our city who are suffering as well.

519
01:04:58,816 --> 01:05:09,643
We offer a prayer of hope for those whose cups are empty, for those whose freedoms have felt curtailed, and for those who have not been able to share fully in all of our country's blessings.

520
01:05:11,284 --> 01:05:19,189
We offer a prayer of support to the leaders of our government, understanding that leading a city with such diversity and freedom is a daunting task.

521
01:05:20,299 --> 01:05:29,388
We offer a prayer of action to the citizen city that we may understand our obligation to be involved in making our city a better place for all who live here.

522
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:38,537
Our God and God of our ancestors, we ask you to bless our city, its government, its leaders, its citizens, and its land.

523
01:05:39,378 --> 01:05:40,740
And let us say amen.

524
01:05:49,735 --> 01:05:52,829
If I could have the Medford Police Honor Guard please retire the colors.

525
01:06:19,461 --> 01:06:20,266
He did a great job.

526
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,181
That concludes our 2026 inauguration.

527
01:06:46,201 --> 01:06:51,772
I just want to thank everybody for coming out, thank everybody for being here, and please remember, be the best version of yourself today.

528
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:53,094
That's all we can ask for.

529
01:06:53,114 --> 01:06:54,317
Congratulations.

530
01:07:10,023 --> 01:07:12,148
It's my first one, so look good to me.

531
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:13,932
You and me both.

532
01:07:24,715 --> 01:07:25,556
There should be a remote right over there.

533
01:07:44,037 --> 01:07:44,317
That's awesome.

534
01:07:44,337 --> 01:07:45,158
My thought was you were going to say that.

535
01:07:45,178 --> 01:07:45,518
You said I'm here.

536
01:08:16,218 --> 01:08:16,498
Oh, look at him.

537
01:08:49,141 --> 01:08:49,321
Thank you.

538
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:49,521
Thank you.

539
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:49,721
Thank you.

540
01:09:16,144 --> 01:09:17,744
Oh, I'm trying to swipe my panel, but I guess it's glass.

541
01:09:17,784 --> 01:09:18,024
Sorry, guys.

542
01:09:47,478 --> 01:09:47,558
Okay.

543
01:09:47,578 --> 01:09:47,658
Yeah.

544
01:10:13,482 --> 01:10:13,562
Yeah.

545
01:10:13,582 --> 01:10:13,662
Yeah.

546
01:10:38,035 --> 01:10:38,115
Yeah.

547
01:10:38,135 --> 01:10:38,215
Yeah.

548
01:11:01,407 --> 01:11:01,487
Okay.

549
01:11:01,527 --> 01:11:01,607
Yeah.

550
01:11:01,627 --> 01:11:01,707
Yeah.

551
01:11:29,322 --> 01:11:30,042
Let's do one just to the end.

552
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:56,334
And you should not read for a while.

553
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,694
You should read for every month.

554
01:11:57,714 --> 01:12:00,835
There's a new library.

555
01:12:01,195 --> 01:12:01,955
It's all up here.

556
01:12:01,995 --> 01:12:04,156
Have you guys checked out Water?

557
01:12:04,176 --> 01:12:04,356
Yeah.

558
01:12:04,416 --> 01:12:07,277
I think it's a general information library.

559
01:12:07,297 --> 01:12:07,997
I don't know.

560
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:08,597
Yeah.

561
01:12:08,617 --> 01:12:09,677
We've used it.

562
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:11,718
And then there's a new bench here.

563
01:12:23,196 --> 01:12:23,496
Okay.

564
01:12:23,516 --> 01:12:23,636
Okay.

565
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:23,796
Okay.

566
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:52,017
you
