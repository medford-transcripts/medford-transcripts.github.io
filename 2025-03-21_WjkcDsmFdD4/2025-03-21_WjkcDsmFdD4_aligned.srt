Please rise and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:52,266
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight for request of suspension of the rules.

21
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:53,367
Councilor Knight?

22
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,507
Yes, Mr. President.

23
00:00:55,547 --> 00:01:04,911
I'd like to invite our good friend and former 2014 Massachusetts Teacher of the Year, Anthony Petrellis, up here to make a little announcement relative to

24
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:10,956
a special project that he's been working on, a fundraiser to help those children stricken with cancer, Mr. President.

25
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:11,736
Very good.

26
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:14,799
So on the motion of Councilor Knight for suspension of the rules, all those in favor?

27
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:15,879
All those opposed?

28
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:16,680
Motion granted.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,424
Suspension of the rules to take the speaker, Teacher of the Year, to present to us on a charitable organization.

30
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:24,185
Professor.

31
00:01:27,928 --> 00:01:28,609
What I had to hear, huh?

32
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,798
Thank you guys for having us.

33
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:35,158
Please state your name and address for the record.

34
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:35,778
Oh, I'm sorry.

35
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:39,900
Anthony Petralas, 124 Harvard Street.

36
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:45,503
I am here because we are doing a special fundraiser.

37
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,303
We participated in last year.

38
00:01:47,343 --> 00:01:48,204
It's called the Buzz Off.

39
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:51,525
It takes place at Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts.

40
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,506
The event takes place June 5th.

41
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:54,606
It's June 5th coming up.

42
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:56,567
And it is an honor.

43
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:57,588
We're honoring a

44
00:01:58,477 --> 00:02:03,141
passing of a student at the McGlynn Elementary School three years ago, Himo Redati.

45
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:09,527
I'm here with his mother and she's here to say a few words about Himo and then we'll talk a little bit more about the event.

46
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,710
Hi, I'm Abir Redati.

47
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,711
I'm Himo's mom.

48
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:21,477
Himo was six years old when he was diagnosed with cancer.

49
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:23,099
He was just a happy, healthy

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,943
funny child, and he started to feel unwell.

51
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:31,105
And then we took him to Children's Hospital.

52
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:38,530
And after investigation, he was diagnosed with spinal cord cancer that has already spread along his spine.

53
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:44,835
After that, he went into surgery and received radiation and chemotherapy.

54
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:48,818
and was treated in Dana-Farber and Children's Hospital.

55
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:54,561
He went to school in second grade and he passed away in his third grade.

56
00:02:55,841 --> 00:03:06,786
And he tried hard, he tried for almost two and a half years to fight cancer, but he couldn't.

57
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:13,149
During his last month in the hospital, we have received a lot of support from

58
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:24,834
Medford families from the McGlynn School, the teachers, the principal, and they really took care of my daughters while I was in the hospital with him for a month.

59
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:29,397
And they took care of me and the girls after he passed away.

60
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:35,902
And they did, like, honor him by just planting a tree outside the school.

61
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:47,278
in his name, and then we had some events that took place also in the school, the Hoops for Hemo, and I will let Anthony talk about it.

62
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:48,219
Thank you.

63
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:55,764
Yeah, so the last couple years we had a basketball game known as Hoops for Hemo, and these are the t-shirts that the teachers wore every year and played.

64
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:58,686
They were also able to be purchased by people in the school.

65
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:01,808
So, you know, we had a blue out, I would say, during the games.

66
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,622
So this Buzz Off event came to us last year.

67
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:12,349
Bier had approached me and several middle school teachers about participating in this event in honor of HEMO.

68
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,872
And last year we raised over $12,000.

69
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:18,497
myself and McGlynn middle school teachers.

70
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:20,298
There was about seven or eight of us that went down there.

71
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:22,700
So this year I kind of assembled my own team.

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,803
One of the people here, Dave Richard, who is a phys ed teacher at Medford High School.

73
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:33,227
Also, I have a fifth grade teacher, Cameron Cosmith, at the Roberts Elementary School.

74
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:37,170
And I have Matt McKenna, a middle school teacher at the McGlynn Middle School.

75
00:04:38,002 --> 00:05:03,673
So we've put a team together, several students are also participating in it this year, and it's been unbelievable support we've had from the city, we've had them put it on their Facebook page, the mayor has written about it, it's been in the paper, all the faculty's been notified of it, and we're just really trying to spread the word of this event, it's such a special event, listening to stories when you're there, meeting kids that are very sick and they're high spirits,

76
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,171
It's just something I was a part of last year, and I thought it was amazing.

77
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:10,552
I really want to try to make this such a big event.

78
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:16,954
Going there last year, there were cities like Milton that brought firefighters, police officers, teachers, cheerleaders.

79
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:22,936
It was a really big event, and we kind of got a late jump on it this year.

80
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:41,923
This is something I kind of really want to work with Abir hand-in-hand with every single year to honor her son who was a great kid and make this something that Medford as a city can kind of unite and participate in for one of their kids.

81
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:51,026
So I thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for allowing me to come here and speak tonight and allow us to be here and spread the word.

82
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:53,636
We have flyers and certificates.

83
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:59,523
If anybody's more interested in learning about it, we'll gladly hand them out to you.

84
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:01,285
We've had a lot of local business support.

85
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:04,569
Boston Physical Therapy and Wellness has donated to us.

86
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,632
Avellino's Sub Shop has donated to us.

87
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:10,306
And we have a word out there at several other places as well.

88
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:19,709
So this is really trying to spread the word, tell the story, and hope that we can gain support in the next month to really show up with a big group of people there.

89
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,850
Thank you guys very much.

90
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:29,472
Mr. President, can we ask Mr. Petrelas if people would like to donate maybe where they can go to do that?

91
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:30,693
Is there a site online?

92
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:38,297
Yes, so this information that I have here explains it a lot better, where to donate.

93
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:44,723
Basically, you would go to onemissionbuzzoff.org, and then you would click the team that you donate.

94
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:45,663
We're Team HEMO.

95
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:49,667
And when you click there, it's pretty self-explanatory.

96
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:53,490
You just kind of fill in the information, what you're donating.

97
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,413
And then it goes right to our team page, so we can see who donates.

98
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:00,476
As I said, it's kind of been spread all over Facebook,

99
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,403
emails, blogs, everything around the city.

100
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:07,024
And as I said, I have papers that I can hand out to you all.

101
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:13,585
We've been giving them to local businesses all across the city, walking and knocking on doors and everything.

102
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:17,266
So I don't know if anybody wants to take these or leave them here.

103
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:18,327
We'll leave them with the messenger.

104
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:19,307
I'm sure he'll give it to all of us.

105
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:41,686
Mr. President, I for one just want to thank the Medford Public Schools, Mr. Rich, Mr. Petrellis, for the work that they do.

106
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:53,816
It's obvious that they're more than just classroom teachers, Mr. President, that they have a true concern for their kids and that they're perfect examples of the great job that our public school system here in Medford is doing in terms of focusing on the whole student,

107
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,613
really caring for the students that are in that classroom.

108
00:07:57,693 --> 00:08:01,556
And, you know, it takes a village, Mr. President, and this is a perfect example of that.

109
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:15,086
To see Hemo's mom here after several years, come back, and to see these two teachers who were affected by Hemo's life and Hemo's, you know, passing, to continue this tradition, it's really moving, Mr. President.

110
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:20,270
And I'd like to thank Mr. Rich and Mr. Petrellis for all their efforts on behalf of the family.

111
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,312
I'm sure that she's thanked them a thousand times over, Mr. President.

112
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:32,032
Really, this is just another perfect example of the work that great public schools do here in the city of Medford, and our great public school teachers, and what they can do when they put their mind to it.

113
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:36,175
So, Mr. President, thank you very much to everybody that's donated.

114
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,937
Thank you to everybody that's paid attention to the cause.

115
00:08:39,057 --> 00:08:47,104
And thank you to these two gentlemen with those beautiful heads of hair that are going to be getting mowed down to wiffle length come early June.

116
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:54,650
With that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to ask that the matter be received and placed on file, but I thank the folks for being up here.

117
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,791
On that motion, Councilor Scott Pelley.

118
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:00,613
If I can, I echo my remarks from Councilor Knight.

119
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:04,475
I actually challenge him because I will shave my head if he shaves his.

120
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:16,723
And no, no, I, I, I, again, but on a serious note, I appreciate mom being here and I know that what that negative situation did

121
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:24,596
to our school at the McGlynn, and our McGlynn family, my son and daughter both being around at the time.

122
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:30,482
And with something negative and sad came out something positive with a lot of pride.

123
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:33,525
And Hemo's name will never be forgotten in my home.

124
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:39,771
And it's people like Mr. Petrellis and Mr. Richard and the fellow teachers that carry on this tradition, his name.

125
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:45,414
And as Mr. Petrella says, next year we get a head start on this.

126
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:51,015
Spread the word and let's challenge the whole community to get around issues like this.

127
00:09:51,075 --> 00:10:01,738
I think that this is what makes our system great because it's real and it deals with real people and how we can stand together and work together for a great cause.

128
00:10:01,798 --> 00:10:06,440
So thank you very much for being here tonight and good luck.

129
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:11,932
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

130
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:18,734
I just also want to thank you for going above and beyond, I think, your call of duty and your job role with the city of Medford.

131
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:24,016
It really obviously means a lot to the mom you have here and, you know, the whole community.

132
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,037
I think it's just definitely something positive.

133
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:27,677
And best of luck with the event.

134
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:30,238
I hope a lot of people get on the website and donate.

135
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:31,438
As you said, it's on Facebook.

136
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:35,439
I hope we see some posts after with new hairdos from the two of you.

137
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,360
And also, I believe the basketball game is this Friday.

138
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,401
I don't know if you want to put a plug in for that.

139
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:45,687
Is that donations for, I got the email today, is that donations for this as well?

140
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:47,448
No, in the past it has been.

141
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:49,270
It's for a different fundraiser this year.

142
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,953
But yeah, in the past it has been.

143
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:58,399
We've raised over I think eight or $9,000 per year that has been donated to, if I'm wrong, tell me.

144
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,742
The Children's Hospital Game Room.

145
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:01,683
Oh, wow.

146
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:11,423
For the last three years, they've been doing this Hoops for Hemo, and all the funds that's raised goes to Children's Hospital.

147
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:18,185
And they have his team's name on the donation board.

148
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:19,126
Great.

149
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:22,267
And the game is 6.30 at the McGlynn.

150
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,268
What cause is that for this year?

151
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:27,288
Jocelyn diabetes.

152
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:28,489
That's right, Jocelyn diabetes.

153
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:28,709
Yes.

154
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:29,489
I should have known that.

155
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:29,849
OK.

156
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:32,050
Well, best of luck with both events.

157
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:32,310
Thank you.

158
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,130
Thank you for coming.

159
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:38,087
Thank you, Mr. President.

160
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:40,248
And I, too, want to lend my support.

161
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:45,749
This is a very worthy cause, and I'm sure it's a very difficult story to bring up.

162
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:49,070
And it's very heart-wrenching, to say the least.

163
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:56,372
I would ask, Mr. President, that if we could, as a council, we have a billboard, electronic billboard, on 93.

164
00:11:58,113 --> 00:12:02,974
And part of the agreement we have with the billboard company is that we're allowed to put

165
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:07,814
a certain number of local community events and activities on the billboard.

166
00:12:08,355 --> 00:12:19,901
And I think that would be a very positive way of uniting not only this community, but everyone that uses 93 in donating and getting active in such a cause.

167
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:30,868
So I would ask that we send a message to the mayor that we'd like to promote this particular event through the use of the electronic billboard at 93.

168
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:37,113
And this is going to be a yearly event that we continue to promote as a city.

169
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:48,123
And as Mr. Petrales mentioned, that we unite as a community and get the police, fire, DPW, anyone in the community that wants to get active and involved.

170
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:52,207
And I think that's a great way of at least getting the message out to the entire community.

171
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:55,690
So I'll ask that be an amendment that we send out, Mr. President.

172
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,230
Very good.

173
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,212
So if a council night is amenable to withdraw his motion, I will withdraw my motion.

174
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:02,773
Mr. President, I think that's an excellent suggestion.

175
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:03,413
An excellent idea.

176
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:04,434
And I support it wholeheartedly.

177
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:08,115
So the motion under discussion now is council marks council cafe.

178
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:08,416
Hello.

179
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:09,336
Thank you, Mr. President.

180
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,757
And Anthony, thank you for coming up here.

181
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:15,839
And then I would like you to come to my Kiwanis meeting on Monday to receive a donation from our club.

182
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,761
So if you come down to Pacelli's on Monday at six o'clock, we would make a donation to your group.

183
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:24,763
So if you can come down, come down and join us for dinner and we would make a donation to you.

184
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:27,931
Councilor Felco.

185
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:28,592
Thank you Mr. President.

186
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:29,852
I just want to thank you for being here tonight.

187
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:30,632
Thank you for coming down.

188
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:32,853
It's a very worthy cause and I just want to wish you well.

189
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:33,674
So good luck.

190
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:34,494
Thank you.

191
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:36,435
Thank you for your good work.

192
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:41,157
So on motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight, roll call vote is requested.

193
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:42,978
Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

194
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:46,899
Councilor Caviello.

195
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:47,640
Yes.

196
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,800
Councilor Felco.

197
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,220
Yes.

198
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,181
Councilor Knight.

199
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:50,541
Yes.

200
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:51,861
Vice President Langley-Curran.

201
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:51,961
Yes.

202
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:53,002
Councilor Marks.

203
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:53,502
Yes.

204
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:54,863
Councilor Scarpelli.

205
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:55,303
Yes.

206
00:13:55,836 --> 00:14:00,078
Yes, with a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

207
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:03,839
While we're under suspension of the rules, Madam Vice President.

208
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:17,525
If we could take, I know there's a number of people in the audience, so if we could take first being 16482, communications from the mayor.

209
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:22,367
16482, communications from the mayor on the motion to take this paper out of order.

210
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:23,187
All those in favor?

211
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:23,968
All those opposed?

212
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:24,748
Motion carries.

213
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:27,297
Communications from the Mayor, 16482.

214
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,910
President Fred DelaRusso and members of the Memphis City Council from...

215
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:35,173
Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor, gift from Hallmark Health Corporation.

216
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:55,196
Dear Mr. President and members of the Medford City Council, in accordance with the provisions of General Law, Chapter 44, Paragraph 53A, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the acceptance of an unconditional gift to the City of Medford from Hallmark Health Corporation of 170 Governors Avenue, Medford Mass, 02155, in the amount of $4,500.

217
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:57,056
It is intended that this gift be used

218
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:11,154
to support a program called Produce in a Snap for Seniors, which provides subsidized farm shares to residents over 60 years of age living in Medford.

219
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:19,562
It will provide them better access to the freshest, locally grown produce, thanks to a collaboration with our four local organizations.

220
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:28,674
Medford farmers market, the board of health slash mass in motion, the Medford housing authority and new entry sustainable farming project.

221
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:33,537
Sarah McGiven will be in attendance at the council meeting for further information.

222
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:35,739
Respectfully submitted.

223
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,821
Stephanie M Burke mayor.

224
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:39,801
Good evening.

225
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:40,262
Welcome.

226
00:15:40,362 --> 00:15:41,863
Please state your name and address for the record.

227
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:42,763
Good evening.

228
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:43,664
I'm Sarah McGiven.

229
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:47,306
I'm the mass in motion coordinator and I'm Eileen Dern.

230
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,568
I'm the director for community services at Hallmark health.

231
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:50,452
Welcome.

232
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:51,013
Thank you.

233
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:54,796
Do you want to present or explain this paper?

234
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:55,216
Sure.

235
00:15:55,456 --> 00:16:10,127
So, um, the program, which you just briefly described called produce in a snap for seniors is one of the programs at the Medford farmer's market, um, has designed to provide food access, greater access to healthy food for people in our community.

236
00:16:10,467 --> 00:16:16,932
The farmer's market, as you may or may not know, does a lot of other programming besides just the farmer's market on Thursday afternoons.

237
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:19,288
And this is one that's specific for seniors.

238
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:22,430
Last year was our first year that we ran the program.

239
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:31,214
And it was sort of a pilot program that provided bags of fresh produce to seniors on Tuesday afternoons.

240
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:36,317
It was subsidized from the Massachusetts Association of Councils on Aging.

241
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:41,860
And basically the seniors came and picked up a bag of fresh produce.

242
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,362
You can see in the handouts that I passed out to you a picture of what some of the

243
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,913
fresh vegetables and fruits looks like.

244
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:59,216
It was a really great variety of everything from beets, lettuce, arugula, berries, apples, you name it, things that were grown in the Lowell area.

245
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:03,578
And the seniors paid $5 for the bag and it was worth about $20.

246
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:14,321
We had such an overwhelming response from the participants in the program last summer that we really worked hard to find funding to run this program again this summer.

247
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:18,264
And the overall program costs close to $10,000.

248
00:17:18,324 --> 00:17:26,168
We were lucky enough to get this great donation from Hallmark Health to cover most of the produce for the program this summer.

249
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:28,128
So that's why Eileen's here, too.

250
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,430
So it's very exciting for us, as well.

251
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:39,893
As most of the folks know, we do do a mobile food market in Malden and ride a shuttle bus down from City Hall every month here in Medford.

252
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:45,375
But Sarai had done such a great job of describing the importance of the program, had great measures.

253
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:49,756
It fit with what we're trying to do to improve health for our patients as well.

254
00:17:50,176 --> 00:18:01,120
And in addition to the donation, we're providing a senior outreach nurse who will be with Sarai and her team to help with cooking and screening and helping with other health initiatives as well.

255
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,442
So it's a really nice use of collaboration to improve the access to good, healthy food for our seniors and really improve

256
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:10,453
that whole idea of isolation.

257
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:15,474
So they'll be helping each other learn how to cook, maybe share some things where they have a little bit more than they need.

258
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:18,155
And I think this will be a great way to work together.

259
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:19,675
So thank you for this opportunity.

260
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:23,536
Thank you.

261
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:30,577
Can you explain which, if all seniors will be involved in the program, will they have to qualify?

262
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:35,578
You just have to be a resident living in Bedford age 60 or older.

263
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:37,538
There's no income qualifications.

264
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,312
I just want to thank you for the donation.

265
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:53,902
This is great and hopefully there will be some sort of marketing and publicity on this so all our seniors can take advantage of it.

266
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:59,167
Will you be posting in the paper and how will you be letting everybody know?

267
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:03,171
Senior newsletter, Facebook transcript patch.

268
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:05,636
all the usual places.

269
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:14,420
We had a tremendously long waiting list last year, so we do give priority to the residents at Medford Housing Authority first, because it's held there at their buildings.

270
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:19,283
And for the 10,000, how many seniors will you be able to get a bag to?

271
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:20,703
We'll have 38 bags per week.

272
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:24,605
So if the same people came every week, we'd be serving 38 people.

273
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,706
But it'll probably be different people coming all the time.

274
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:27,686
And how many weeks?

275
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:31,088
16, July through October.

276
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,551
So come and visit if you ever get a chance on Tuesdays.

277
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:38,591
Thank you.

278
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:45,052
Thank you very much to Hallmark Health for their support of what is shaping up to be a rather popular program.

279
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:53,614
Thank you to Mass in Motion as well for doing your efforts to fundraise and to commit yourself to such an endeavor.

280
00:19:54,054 --> 00:20:01,575
I think that it speaks volumes when the actual people that are involved in the organization are going out there and soliciting donations because they believe in the product that they're putting out there.

281
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,037
Thank you very much, Ms.

282
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:07,079
McGibbon, and thank you very much to our friends at Hallmark Health.

283
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:13,965
This is the perfect example of strong public-private partnership, Mr. President, and it's something that I hope that we can build on for years to come.

284
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:20,230
I, for one, am very supportive of accepting the donation and would move for approval, but thank you very much.

285
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,233
Thank you.

286
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:28,957
And this is a great program, and I appreciate the donation from Hallmark Health also.

287
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:34,354
The registration one has to go to the council on aging to register.

288
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,155
Is that how it works?

289
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:36,995
We're going to hold registration for one day.

290
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:39,016
I think it's probably going to be June 14th.

291
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:42,757
We'll start out with, um, at the Medford housing authority sites.

292
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:50,159
Well, I'll move around to different sites and register people there and then, uh, go to the, um, senior center.

293
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:50,720
Yeah.

294
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,601
But we have to give priority to the people who live at Medford housing authority first.

295
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:55,861
Okay.

296
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:57,722
And, um, the,

297
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:02,547
It's weekly pickup afterwards, right, once you register for the program.

298
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:06,648
And the weekly pickup is at the senior housing, is that correct?

299
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:10,030
No, it was at 121 Riverside Avenue, the Salton Stall building.

300
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,433
It's a nice big open space with a kitchen that we can use for doing cooking demos.

301
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,173
Right.

302
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:21,775
What about for just fresh fruits and vegetables if someone wants?

303
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,016
They can come to the farmer's market.

304
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:30,036
Or they can come to the market that we run through Hallmark Health for the second Saturday of the month.

305
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,018
And we do provide transportation from City Hall.

306
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:34,839
You provide it from City Hall.

307
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:35,219
Yes.

308
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,463
Is there any outreach at all involved in this for shut-ins and people that actually can't get out?

309
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:46,682
Well, we're relying on the newsletter that comes out of the senior center.

310
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:53,904
Um, and I also distribute flyers to the food pantries and a transcript article.

311
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:55,364
Um, right.

312
00:21:55,384 --> 00:22:01,946
But if you have any other ideas, if, well, if I'm homebound and I can't get out, um, how would I be able to participate?

313
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:06,467
Oh, um, we did have some volunteers last summer that were willing to pick people up and bring them to the site.

314
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:11,368
Um, it didn't end up being needed, but we can try to do that again this summer.

315
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:12,288
That'd be great.

316
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:16,891
And just, you know, I love the farmer's market.

317
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:18,032
I think it does a lot of great.

318
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:34,321
However, price-wise, from what I hear from the seniors, and it's great to have local grown produce and so forth, but many of the seniors are priced out of getting fruits and vegetables from the farmer's market.

319
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,343
And I'd like to see some type of component.

320
00:22:37,383 --> 00:22:40,145
Maybe you aren't the correct people to speak with,

321
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:51,012
I'd like to see some type of component that would embrace our seniors and those that are on fixed incomes that may be priced out of that particular venue.

322
00:22:51,232 --> 00:23:00,818
We have our EBT matching program on Thursdays, so that's people who are receiving government benefits, formerly known as food stamps, now called SNAP.

323
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:05,557
We actually match that and double the value of those, so that makes it a little bit more accessible to people.

324
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:15,765
But there's, of course, all those families that don't qualify for federal assistance and then are kind of outside that category and can't get those benefits from us.

325
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:23,151
But also, I mean, this program was designed to serve seniors who maybe can't afford or can't get to the farmer's market.

326
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:27,394
And because this is actually subsidized, they're getting a bag that's worth $15 for $5.

327
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:30,377
So trying to make it a little bit more equitable.

328
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:36,104
And the market on Saturday, the second Saturday, in fact, it's this Saturday coming up, there's no fee at all.

329
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:37,866
So it's completely free for them.

330
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:39,967
And the transportation is free as well.

331
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:42,028
And we can help people set up the rides.

332
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:43,689
Some of our customers come with a ride.

333
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,311
And folks from Medford do volunteer and help out.

334
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:54,757
Because I know the police chief makes robocalls often to let people know that that market is there and that it's free for Medford residents.

335
00:23:55,057 --> 00:23:57,278
And when they call, they don't call us to register.

336
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:00,080
They actually call here at Medford City Hall so that they

337
00:24:00,518 --> 00:24:02,339
they feel like it's a Medford-based program.

338
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:08,001
And do you know if this is listed in the Senior Sounds, which is a newsletter that goes out to the seniors?

339
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:13,664
I'm not sure, but... You may want to check that, because a lot of seniors get that delivered.

340
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:15,885
And we do have flyers that are available.

341
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:21,688
We send them to the Board of Health, so they would receive a flyer every month with the dates and times.

342
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:26,830
We work very closely with Diane McLeod just to make sure that it gets out to the right folks.

343
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:33,171
And then, in addition, we get it out to all the different doctor's office practices so that they can hang that in their office and refer.

344
00:24:33,512 --> 00:24:38,515
And we're actually working very hard with the Greater Boston Food Bank to add even some more programs like this.

345
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:48,781
They've just hired a physician to work with them because they really feel strongly that, just as you're saying, that making sure that the most vulnerable people have access to fresh, healthy foods.

346
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:49,401
That's great.

347
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:51,702
I would just, if you could, check the senior sounds.

348
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:54,384
I know a lot of seniors use that as their

349
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:55,468
information.

350
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:56,789
Yes, we'd be glad to do.

351
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:57,649
Thanks very much.

352
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:58,129
You're welcome.

353
00:24:58,309 --> 00:24:58,750
Thank you.

354
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:03,711
So on the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

355
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:05,912

362
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:10,994
Yes.

363
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:11,794
Councilor Marks?

364
00:25:12,015 --> 00:25:12,355

Councilor Scott Kelly?

366
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:13,695
Yes.

368
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:15,256
Yes.

369
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:17,337
With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none of the negative.

370
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:19,257
The gift is received.

371
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:22,258
Thank you for your generosity and thank you for your good work.

372
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:22,959
Our pleasure.

373
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:23,399
Thank you.

374
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:32,496
On the suspension, Councilor Knight, while we're on the suspension, to take 16-479.

375
00:25:33,217 --> 00:25:40,421
On the motion of Councilor Knight to take 16-479, petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

376
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:50,707
Petition by Michael Kiff-Miriam, owner of On-Call Taxi, Incorporated, doing business as Metric Cab, 407 Rear, Mystic Avenue.

378
00:25:58,646 --> 00:26:03,690
And the chair recognizes Councilor Caviello, Chairman.

379
00:26:19,783 --> 00:26:20,684
of the licensing.

380
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:21,485
Thank you, Mr. President.

381
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:31,894
Mr. President, this is a, an upgrade from a, uh, 2007 to 2009, uh, uh, taxi, uh, vehicle improvement in, uh, papers are, uh, in order, Mr. President.

Thank you, Mr. President.

386
00:26:42,943 --> 00:26:46,907
While we're under similar matters, 16, four 80 petition by Joseph Pierre,

00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:50,920
Owner of Citywide Tax Incorporated, 40 Canal Street, to upgrade.

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,541
Mr. Pierre, are you here?

389
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:57,905
In the absence of Mr. Pierre, who is not here, Councilor Caviello.

390
00:26:57,925 --> 00:26:59,486
Mr. President, my motion must be tabled.

391
00:27:00,207 --> 00:27:01,868
On the motion of Councilor Caviello to table.

392
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:02,508
All those in favor?

393
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,129

Matter to be tabled.

395
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:08,753
Councilor Knight.

396
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:09,413
Paper 16481, Mr. President.

397
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,075
While we're in suspension, I'd like to take that matter up as well.

398
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:17,039
On the motion of Councilor Knight to take number 16481, communications and report from city boards and commissions.

399
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:29,919
16481 John Costas, Treasurer of the Civic Auditorium Commission, Chevalier Theatre, to update the City Council on an opportunity presented to the Commission by the North Shore Music Theatre and other updates to the theatre.

400
00:27:31,761 --> 00:27:34,183
Mr. Costas, welcome.

401
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,685
Please state your name and address for the record.

402
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:37,525
Good evening.

403
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:38,766
John Costas, 56 Hain Street.

404
00:27:41,936 --> 00:27:47,481
Well, let me start by saying I'm up here as a citizen, not as a 30-year member of the Chevalier Commission.

405
00:27:48,381 --> 00:28:06,638
And one of the reasons why I chose this forum is back in 1981, when the council voted to retain the theater and put it under the direction of a commission, part of the job was to renovate, rehab, operate it, and bring it up to a level

406
00:28:07,672 --> 00:28:14,955
where professional management companies or groups would want to use us.

407
00:28:15,575 --> 00:28:34,882
And that's not exactly the words I wanted to use, but we're now at a level where a professional production company has voiced an interest in putting on professional concerts, Broadway shows, and run a movie series.

408
00:28:35,342 --> 00:28:36,883
That was North Shore Music Theater.

409
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:43,639
Now, they're only one body that happened to voice an interest in Chevalier Theater.

410
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:51,565
And there's a lot of people still around that remember Chevalier Theater when it was being saved in 1981.

411
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:58,430
And unfortunately, with 35 years past, a lot of them can't come out to the city council, and they don't come to the theater.

412
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:06,196
So I felt this would be the best way of letting these people know that we're just about there now.

413
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:20,792
We now have one company that has two successful theaters, one in the North Shore, Beverly Music Theater, and down on the South Shore, Theater by the Sea, and has seven movie theaters that has an interest.

414
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:32,100
Now, speaking for myself, now that we have one corporation that has an interest in us, there's a possibility that other people may come forth now.

415
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,023
Because once one person comes through and they realize we're viable,

416
00:29:37,115 --> 00:29:40,097
And this is the first time that I'm really confident that we're viable.

417
00:29:40,117 --> 00:29:44,060
There's other opportunities for the community and the theater.

418
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,704
And obviously, all these studies that the city had done over the past 30 years said the same thing.

419
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:56,428
Chevalier Theater is the key to Medford Square to bring in shows on a weekend.

420
00:29:56,688 --> 00:30:06,235
And if we can present, or if a company can present shows every week, or a series of movies, we've certainly accomplished the goal

421
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:08,022
that the people wanted in 1981.

422
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:13,506
And I know it makes me sound old, but I'm old.

423
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:21,631
And I just wanted to just convey that there's a possibility out there that this corporation has an interest in us.

424
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:30,077
And if an RFP is presented out there to find anybody else that may be interested, I mean, that would be great.

425
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:35,681
Maybe there's a second corporation out there that has an interest in the theater.

426
00:30:36,456 --> 00:30:37,937
But if there's one, there could be more.

427
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:39,779
Thank you.

428
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:40,099
Thank you.

429
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:41,240
Thank you very much.

430
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:49,466
On the motion of Councilor Knight to receive and pay less on file.

431
00:30:50,287 --> 00:31:02,116
Mr. President, I think that it might make sense for us to refer this to the arts and culture subcommittee for an update from the council when in fact they do maybe put on an RFP or receive some further interest from other people and then the subcommittee can report back to us at that time.

432
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:05,399
On the motion of Councilor Knight, Councilor Longo Crenshaw.

433
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,965
Thank you, President De La Russo.

434
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:15,707
The Arts and Culture, Culture, oh, sorry, Subcommittee on Cultural Arts and History did publish a notice.

435
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:23,988
That's, I believe, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Marks, and I. And we do have a meeting scheduled next Tuesday at 6 p.m.

436
00:31:24,088 --> 00:31:24,988
for this very reason.

437
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:33,090
I believe there's a number of things going on with Chevalier that need to be, we really haven't been updated on, and it's about time that we figure out

438
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,812
what's going on, what offers are out there, what RFPs are, you know, in line.

439
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:44,775
We've been briefed and we've talked to a number of different people, I'm sure each and every one of us have.

440
00:31:44,855 --> 00:32:00,461
So it's definitely time for a meeting, time to sit down and start the discussion and start getting updated ourselves so we know what is going on and we can help in any way we can as well as, you know, give advice if that's, you know, necessary or wanted.

441
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,541
So we do have a meeting scheduled next week at 6.

442
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:07,483
I'm not sure if there's going to be a conflict with that, but as of right now, that is scheduled.

443
00:32:07,543 --> 00:32:13,466
So hopefully we'll learn from, you know, the whole commission is invited, John and the whole commission.

444
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:16,867
So hopefully we can get more of an idea of what's going on.

445
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:21,049
And I appreciate Mr. Costas informing us of this new news.

446
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:23,110
And I look forward to the meeting next week.

447
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:29,225
Councilor Knight, with your motion then, since the meeting has already been called.

448
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:30,366
Receive and place on file Mr. President.

449
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:32,628
On the motion of Councilor Knight to receive and place on file.

450
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:33,389
Yes Mr. President.

451
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,051
Just what I meant to say, and it goes along with the Councilor.

452
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:42,075
Thursday, this Thursday coming, at 7 o'clock, the Chevalier Commission is meeting.

453
00:32:42,956 --> 00:32:50,362
It's an open public meeting, and at that meeting is where they'll be discussing an RFP that will be going out.

454
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:58,322
And at this meeting, I've asked somebody to be there that has experience in theater rental and so forth.

455
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:05,746
So that if we have any questions, if I have any questions, he represents the theater, we can talk to him as well.

456
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:10,369
But it's Thursday at 7 o'clock, Chevalier Theater.

457
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:11,169
Thank you.

458
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:11,870
Thank you.

459
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,973
On the motion, Councilor, I'm sorry, Councilor Scappelli is next.

460
00:33:17,313 --> 00:33:18,874
If I can, Mr. Costa, thank you very much.

461
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:19,734
Just a quick question.

462
00:33:21,578 --> 00:33:25,660
Did the North Shore Music Theater, did these representatives come and search you out?

463
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,202
Or did we go out and commission?

464
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:32,303
They came to us.

465
00:33:32,623 --> 00:33:33,083
They came to us.

466
00:33:33,103 --> 00:33:39,586
And then the owner of North Shore Music Theater, Bill Haney, he took a brief site visit because he had never seen it.

467
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:46,589
But he heard from his associate who had been in there that the size of the theater and what we have done in the past.

468
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:49,410
Did they give you any indication of what they wanted to?

469
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:52,645
get involved in?

470
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,046
No, no, we didn't.

471
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,548
That's all, you know, has not been discussed.

472
00:33:57,628 --> 00:33:58,989
It's just an interest.

473
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,173
They want to invest money and make improvements to the theater and to its appearance.

474
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:09,918
This absolutely hasn't been any discussion on money, value, anything like that.

475
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:15,222
It's just they came to us interested in us and it kind of made me excited.

476
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:20,932
I look forward to our subcommittee meeting and maybe attending your meeting on Thursday.

477
00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:22,856
What would that be and what time?

478
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:24,920
It's in the lobby of Chevalier Theater at 7 o'clock.

479
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:31,191
And again, again, this is something I think we all echoed.

480
00:34:31,211 --> 00:34:43,361
And if you looked at everybody's, um, uh, literature going out and running for office, everybody talked about the jewel of the city and the heartbeat of our community is the, uh, Chevalier theater.

481
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,083
So we're pretty, pretty excited about this and appreciate it.

482
00:34:46,123 --> 00:34:46,443
Thank you.

483
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:47,244
Thank you.

484
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:48,205
Thank you.

485
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:51,127
Chair recognizes council cafe.

486
00:34:51,227 --> 00:34:51,867
Thank you, Mr. President.

487
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:52,508
Mr. President, you know,

488
00:34:52,970 --> 00:35:05,534
With Chevalier being one of the largest venues in the Boston area, I think it's the fifth largest seating capacity in the area, I think some professional management of the building is well needed.

489
00:35:05,574 --> 00:35:13,436
And I hope that we'll have several offers of someone to take over, at least to manage the building and keep it viable.

490
00:35:13,516 --> 00:35:17,977
And I would hope that part of, with a group that wants to invest some money,

491
00:35:18,677 --> 00:35:30,926
I hope a marquee will be in discussion for that building, because when the marquee was there during the filming of the movie, it made the building look very alive, and I think that made a big difference.

492
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:35,469
So if that could be part of the discussion, I would like to see that.

493
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,230
Thank you, Mr. President.

494
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:36,610
Thank you.

495
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:38,271
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

496
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:40,193
Thank you, Mr. President.

497
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:45,777
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the organizations that have done so much over the

498
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:49,237
30, 40 plus years to keep Chevalier up and running.

499
00:35:50,217 --> 00:36:10,270
And, uh, without a very, I should say without really any impact, uh, or assistance from the city and, uh, the friends of Chevalier and also the, uh, Chevalier commission, uh, has done yeoman's work, uh, and bringing in, uh, new performances without a city budget.

500
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,892
Uh, they're doing the best they can to make sure

501
00:36:13,352 --> 00:36:17,634
that that remains a place that's vibrant in this community.

502
00:36:18,214 --> 00:36:31,180
And I can just tell you from being active on the Friends that the people that are involved with the Friends and the Chevalier Commission are probably our most dedicated board members.

503
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,542
And the amount of time and effort that goes into it behind the scenes

504
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:36,658
that you don't see.

505
00:36:36,698 --> 00:36:40,420
There's not front page stories in the local paper.

506
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:55,827
But let me tell you, the hours that are put in by these members to keep that Chevalier opening and functioning, not just for outsiders, but for residents of this community, is really remarkable what they've been able to do over the years.

507
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,268
And I personally would just like to thank

508
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:01,604
the friends of Chevalier and the Chevalier commissioners.

509
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:12,511
I know there's been a few new appointees to the commission and the amount of thoughts and new ideas that are surfacing now is incredible.

510
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,232
And if they can harness that

511
00:37:14,702 --> 00:37:22,604
and push it forward, I think we're going to see what Councilor Scott Pelley just mentioned, a renewed interest in this community.

512
00:37:22,624 --> 00:37:43,410
You know, these members have had an interest for many years, and now it's time that the community takes an interest, and also the city elected officials to put some money up in the budget, a yearly dollar amount in the budget, to make sure that we can bring in entertainment.

513
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:54,041
And, uh, you look at any other in Lowell or any other, uh, area that's, uh, has a similar theater, uh, they're doing it with assistance from the city.

514
00:37:55,082 --> 00:38:00,064
And I think the city has to play an active role in a good, be a good partner in this process.

515
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:12,791
And, uh, I'm hoping that, uh, this particular budget, like we did with the arts, uh, to recognize the arts in the city budget, um, that we will do the same for the Chevalier commission.

516
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:25,812
to put it once again on the map and show that the city has a vested interest in this gem that we have in our community that we've all talked about being the economic engine in the community.

517
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:29,133
But, you know, you can't have an engine without gas.

518
00:38:29,753 --> 00:38:32,354
And the city refuses to put gas in the engine.

519
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:36,316
And I'm hoping that changes this budget, Mr. President.

520
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,316
Thank you, Councilman.

521
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:38,116
Councilor Falco.

522
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:38,997
Thank you, Mr. President.

523
00:38:39,037 --> 00:38:42,118
I just wanted to echo some of the sentiments of my colleagues as well.

524
00:38:43,428 --> 00:38:48,252
First of all, I thank Mr. Costas for his years of dedication, but the commissioners as well.

525
00:38:48,892 --> 00:38:54,416
And, you know, like we said earlier, during the campaign, this came up many times.

526
00:38:54,476 --> 00:38:57,638
And this is really, I think, the key to economic development in Bedford Square.

527
00:38:58,118 --> 00:39:00,920
We have a 2000 seat theater in a downtown business district.

528
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,122
We need to make sure it's utilized on a regular basis.

529
00:39:03,562 --> 00:39:07,785
This is an exciting opportunity to think that a company like North Shore Music Theory wants to come in.

530
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:09,465
We should embrace this.

531
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:12,448
Our city needs to embrace the theater.

532
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:13,929
We need to embrace this building.

533
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:15,891
I think for far too long we haven't.

534
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:17,712
We need to embrace it as a community.

535
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:18,553
I definitely support

536
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:23,828
the city putting money towards the theater during the budget process.

537
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:26,389
I think we're heading in the right direction by doing this.

538
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:30,610
I look forward to hearing the results of the meeting next week and the meeting on Thursday night.

539
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,731
And I definitely support this initiative.

540
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:39,772
I believe that this is truly the key to economic development in our square.

541
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:40,612
So thank you.

542
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:41,622
Thank you, Councilor.

543
00:39:41,642 --> 00:39:45,483
So on the motion of Councilor Knight to receive and place on file seconded by Councilor Falco.

544
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:46,483
All those in favor?

545
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:46,664
Aye.

546
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:47,644
Opposed?

547
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:48,644
The motion carries.

548
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:53,865
Madam Vice President, would you want to go?

549
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:58,187
On the motion of Vice President Lago-Kern to return to the regular order of business.

550
00:39:58,207 --> 00:39:59,107
All those in favor?

551
00:39:59,127 --> 00:39:59,767
All those opposed?

552
00:39:59,787 --> 00:40:02,288
The motion carries.

553
00:40:02,308 --> 00:40:04,128
16-470 offered by Vice President Lago-Kern.

554
00:40:04,628 --> 00:40:07,269
Be it resolved that the Metro City Council be given a copy

555
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:15,099
of the edited and updated RFP that will be voted on by the Methodist School Committee regarding the leasing of the Field of Dreams.

556
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:16,059
Madam Vice President.

557
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,561
Thank you, President De La Russo.

558
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:27,685
Watching the school committee meeting last Monday, so a week from yesterday, there was discussion on a bubble.

559
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:34,149
It seems like there's going to be a top over the Field of Dreams

560
00:40:35,964 --> 00:40:40,507
During the months of November till March They did there was serious discussion.

561
00:40:40,567 --> 00:41:01,259
There was input that was given by each school committee member There was question on whether the council should have involvement I know there was a couple school committee members that wanted the council to be involved and that was that idea was kind of shut down but Due to it being school property I've gotten calls after the article after the school committee meeting.

562
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:03,620
I've gotten calls questions have been asked to me and

563
00:41:04,057 --> 00:41:08,981
We also were the body that approved the bond to implement the Field of Dreams.

564
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:11,043
It's been very successful.

565
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:17,809
I know in the first two years when we did ask for the numbers, I believe the income and revenue was paying for the field.

566
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:24,855
I know that one issue is their lack of maintenance budget, so this may very well be a great idea.

567
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:31,741
It may very well be a possibility to use these funds that are going to be brought in by an outside company.

568
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:34,032
to maintain the field.

569
00:41:34,112 --> 00:41:44,575
Now, I believe we have somebody here who has more of a background than I do, but this bubble or this RFP that they want to put out is for $75,000 per season.

570
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:56,918
Medford children will only get to use the bubble from 2.30 to 4, 5 days a week, which is the weekdays, and then possibly sometime during the day.

571
00:41:56,938 --> 00:41:56,978
So,

572
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:04,144
My request is just simply to review the RFP, to take a look at it.

573
00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:12,711
I know that they did want to push it through a week ago, but there were some updates that some of the school committee members did want to see.

574
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:16,494
So I would just like to review the RFP, take a look at it.

575
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:22,458
It is on school property, but the school is part of the city buildings.

576
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:23,679
It's part of the city budget.

577
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:28,823
So I do want to just take a look at the RFP, and I hope that my colleagues will understand that and agree with me.

578
00:42:29,853 --> 00:42:31,855
more eyes on something obviously is better.

579
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,216
And that's really it.

580
00:42:33,236 --> 00:42:36,579
Can you just explain what you mean by take a look and review it?

581
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:39,621
You mean you're asking for a copy of it so you can look at it?

582
00:42:39,902 --> 00:42:40,202
Correct.

583
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:45,166
Just looking for a copy of the RFP that's going to be sent out or voted on.

584
00:42:45,326 --> 00:42:54,734
It's my understanding at this point in time there is no RFP because they're in the process of drafting the RFP and that's what the discussions at the school committee meeting were surrounded.

585
00:42:56,442 --> 00:43:05,665
It's also my further understanding that once the RFP terms are agreed upon by the policy-setting body for the school department, the school committee, that this RFP will be voted on.

586
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:07,626
And once it's voted on, it will become public record.

587
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:09,746
So I don't see any problem with this.

588
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:10,566
Plenty of information.

589
00:43:10,586 --> 00:43:12,227
Plenty of information, Madam Vice President.

590
00:43:12,267 --> 00:43:18,469
There was a full RFP presented to the school committee eight days ago.

591
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:24,091
It was a full RFP that the administrators wanted to get approved that night.

592
00:43:25,824 --> 00:43:28,045
few changes that just need to be updated.

593
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:33,207
So that should be drafted already, because I know that the next meeting is when they want them to vote on it.

594
00:43:33,267 --> 00:43:38,589
So I would like to take a look at it before it's voted on, just in case we have any questions and concerns.

595
00:43:39,169 --> 00:43:45,131
And I also want to be able to answer questions and concerns of the constituents and the parents that have been reaching out to me with questions.

596
00:43:46,592 --> 00:43:48,273
Mr. President, my point of information was this.

597
00:43:48,353 --> 00:43:51,454
Until the school committee votes on the RFP to be issued, there is no RFP.

598
00:43:55,248 --> 00:44:00,550
There is a draft RFP, so I'd like the draft RFP, updated RFP, that will be voted on.

599
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,110
As a matter of course.

600
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:17,936
So your motion is, so the chair can have clarity, Madam Vice President, you are requesting for a copy of the draft RFP for the so-called bubble over the field of dreams, which I think has a real name.

601
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,016
Edgeley Field.

602
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:20,656
Edgeley Field.

603
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:29,844
uh, you're asking that draft to be forwarded to the method city councilors, uh, for their personal perusal.

604
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:30,624
Yes, please.

605
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:31,245
Yes.

606
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:34,545
So on that motion, councilor Scott Pelley.

607
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,065
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

608
00:44:36,145 --> 00:44:48,108
And, uh, uh, I did, I talked to a few of the, uh, city counselors and, um, and talk to a bunch of the parents about the, uh, edgily field project and bubble project.

609
00:44:48,668 --> 00:44:48,688
I,

610
00:44:49,817 --> 00:45:02,643
happen to be one of the members on the Field of Dreams Committee when we look to, you know, an innovative way of bringing artificial turf facilities for our students and kids in the community.

611
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:04,664
And it was highly successful.

612
00:45:04,724 --> 00:45:09,386
I think that with spearheaded by Bill Carr Jr.

613
00:45:09,926 --> 00:45:17,629
and his group that he put together, they reached out and went through walls to make sure that this dream came to reality.

614
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:42,556
One thing we thought outside the box at the time, and people worked very hard, and at the time we had a cell phone company that came in and wanted to actually lease the land for one of the worst hotspots in the United States and bring a cell phone tower that would help fund that project.

615
00:45:42,996 --> 00:45:47,037
Unfortunately, that didn't work out, and it went out to Bond.

616
00:45:48,457 --> 00:46:02,866
And as we're moving forward with this project, I'm actually excited that Medford has the innovation and the forthright to think outside the box, because I think this is what we're looking for.

617
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:14,839
The bubble, the questions I had were we, you know, our schools are a mess and let's put our funding to this and we're lacking this and we're lacking that.

618
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:30,830
Clarification on that is that the RFP, from what was told to me yesterday, is the funding would come from one of the outside agencies that would come in and fund that, fund it completely.

619
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,831
Another question was that,

620
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:39,308
that if it bubbles, the overuse is going to ruin the turf.

621
00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:49,973
And studies have shown, from what I've done my research and being in my field, that actually it lengthens the turf because it's covered, not weathered.

622
00:46:51,774 --> 00:46:55,596
Some other issues are what funding would come in and what would happen.

623
00:46:55,976 --> 00:46:59,258
Well, we're talking about a maintenance plan that we're not very happy that.

624
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:12,429
most of the things we're doing in our community that in the past that hasn't been a capital improvement plan and we're looking at an RFP going out for someone to come in, bubble

625
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:35,792
an area that would normally sit dormant and have the opportunity, from what I've been told, that would open up the mornings for recreational space for our seniors and provide some walking programs and stuff that we've lost with the Meadow Glen Mall closing and having the physical education department using that.

626
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:41,092
and then using the athletic teams, using that for practice.

627
00:47:41,672 --> 00:47:52,619
And then another piece of that is making sure that whatever entity came in to do this, it would give the Method residents an opportunity to participate in any program at half of the price.

628
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:54,300
I believe that's what was told to me.

629
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:06,349
There's a lot of questions we have, but these are the clarifications that I wanted to give that I made sure that I made some phone calls.

630
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:09,730
I did talk to a few of the school kid members and they were heard.

631
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:17,652
And I also hear that it will go out to vote on, on, um, on Monday at the school committee meeting because they did their due diligence.

632
00:48:18,073 --> 00:48:25,495
And I believe it was a subcommittee, but I believe there were at least five members there that shared their concerns.

633
00:48:25,795 --> 00:48:26,255
And, um,

634
00:48:26,957 --> 00:48:31,439
and put their input into this possibility.

635
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:38,041
So I appreciate Vice President Longo-Kern for bringing this up.

636
00:48:38,622 --> 00:48:41,563
And again, I applaud what we're trying to do.

637
00:48:41,623 --> 00:48:53,368
I just hope, as we move forward, that we can set an identity of what we're doing with the funding to make sure that we're looking to do that and putting it back to the field.

638
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:54,348
So, thank you.

639
00:48:54,887 --> 00:48:55,668
Thank you, Councilor.

640
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:57,989
Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

641
00:48:58,249 --> 00:48:58,870
Thank you, Mr. President.

642
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:07,035
Mr. President, I'm happy to see that our school committee is sticking outside the box and being innovative with these type of projects.

643
00:49:07,115 --> 00:49:13,580
And my only concern is that I just want to make sure that our children, our community,

644
00:49:14,273 --> 00:49:16,596
Don't get pushed aside on this.

645
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:26,430
They have ample time to use this hopefully good innovation for their benefit and not more to private company using it.

646
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,972
So that's one of my biggest concerns.

647
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:31,736
Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

648
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:35,139
To answer that, when I did talk to them, that was one of the biggest questions.

649
00:49:35,499 --> 00:49:46,487
And having time there and finding a balance, just as we do with all of our fields and what we're trying to do when you rent a facility, there's got to be a balance.

650
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:48,268
If someone's going to come in and

651
00:49:48,730 --> 00:50:02,981
and bid for a bubble that's going to cost $1.8 million and put what they're asking for, the RFP, bathrooms, locker rooms, concession stand, parking lots, you're talking about making sure there's a balance, if that's done.

652
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:10,407
So, you know, again, this is where I think, where this isn't coming out of our taxpayers' pockets.

653
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:22,776
This is an outside agency coming in and paying for future ventures, which will be probably $500,000 in field replacement within five to eight years on that facility.

654
00:50:22,836 --> 00:50:24,017
So thank you.

655
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:24,798
Like I said, I'm happy.

656
00:50:24,818 --> 00:50:29,021
I'm happy with thinking out of the box and being innovative and you know, that's what I think it's all about.

657
00:50:29,441 --> 00:50:34,625
And again, I just want to make sure that our, our children are getting better because I can already envision the calls coming.

658
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,567
Oh, you know, my kid couldn't get the play, you know,

659
00:50:36,987 --> 00:50:41,291
So, again, that's a big concern, and I want to make sure that we're protected on that end.

660
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:44,073
Councilor Nights.

661
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:45,834
Mr. President, I do have a question.

662
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:51,219
What were those periods of time that Councilor Lungo referred to as to when the bubble was going to be up?

663
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:53,501
Madam Vice President, if you could.

664
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:58,805
The bubble in the RFP, it says from November to March, and it says that.

665
00:50:58,825 --> 00:51:01,887
Do you have a copy of the RFP already?

666
00:51:01,928 --> 00:51:03,128
No, I watched the school committee meeting.

667
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:03,469
Oh.

668
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:04,970
Yeah, it was discussed in length.

669
00:51:06,117 --> 00:51:11,500
The contractor selected by the district would have use of the fields from 4 to 11 p.m.

670
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,881
on weeknights and 8 a.m.

671
00:51:12,901 --> 00:51:13,061
to 11 p.m.

672
00:51:13,141 --> 00:51:13,481
on weekends.

673
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:17,809
from those months.

674
00:51:18,189 --> 00:51:27,755
And the reason I ask, Mr. President, because having been very familiar with the administration of the fields, they closed usually at Thanksgiving and they didn't open up again until after March.

675
00:51:28,295 --> 00:51:32,258
So in essence, the fields are closed for the period of time that the bubble would be up normally.

676
00:51:32,698 --> 00:51:34,960
So any use that we're getting out of it would be bonus.

677
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:45,927
You know, if we can establish a public-private partnership with an entity that wants to come in there and invest money into our infrastructure at the fields during and use it for the majority of time during a period of time where it would actually be

678
00:51:46,357 --> 00:51:54,158
inaccessible to everybody, anyhow, I don't see any downside to this whatsoever, Mr. President.

679
00:51:54,178 --> 00:52:04,020
They're going to come up, they're going to invest some money into the city of Medford, they're going to invest some money into our facilities, they're going to make our state of the fields even more state of the art, I guess you'd want to say.

680
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,541
I'm a little confused by the resolution.

681
00:52:07,321 --> 00:52:12,282
I'm not going to be in a position to tell the school committee not to vote on something that's in front of them they're comfortable to vote on.

682
00:52:12,902 --> 00:52:13,742
They're the policy setting.

683
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:17,583
of our government for all things that are related to the school department, Mr. President.

684
00:52:17,603 --> 00:52:18,925
So I can't support- Point of information.

685
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:20,766
Point of information, Madam Vice President.

686
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,007
The resolution doesn't say that.

687
00:52:23,028 --> 00:52:30,374
I believe the resolution doesn't say that, but I believe as you were speaking in your presentation, you said, I just want to get a copy of the RFP to look at it and review it before they vote on it.

688
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:40,602
Personally- If I have questions, I maybe could give a call to a few school committee members and ask, because one question that has come to my attention is the weekends, 8 a.m.

689
00:52:40,622 --> 00:52:40,962
to 11 p.m.

690
00:52:42,716 --> 00:52:54,863
Why can't Medford kids, you're the negotiator, you do that for a living, so maybe a couple hours on a Saturday, Medford kids can't play on it, and I'm not saying they should or shouldn't be able to, but I have questions.

691
00:52:54,923 --> 00:53:10,612
Again, I believe, because I watched that same meeting and I actually talked to a few school committee members, part of that is something that was stressed, that whatever programs go on at those times, whether it be four to 11 or eight to 11 on the weekends,

692
00:53:11,595 --> 00:53:19,660
whatever entity comes in and wants that situation, that's Medford residents will have an opportunity to participate in those programs.

693
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:30,066
So in other words, where other in other ways, unless we start a cross country ski program, which I think is a great idea with community schools, they can do that up there.

694
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:31,427
So thank you.

695
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:31,907
Thank you.

696
00:53:32,808 --> 00:53:33,828
Counselor Knight has the floor.

697
00:53:33,848 --> 00:53:34,028
Yeah.

698
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:38,651
So as I was saying, Mr. President, I'm not comfortable telling the school community they can't vote on something until we get a copy of something.

699
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:40,252
Um, so for that reason,

700
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:42,307
I won't be supporting this paper.

701
00:53:42,947 --> 00:53:46,489
Thank you.

702
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,631
The citizen at the podium wishes to address us.

703
00:53:49,091 --> 00:53:49,531
Good evening.

704
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:51,993
Please state your name and address for the record, and welcome.

705
00:53:52,273 --> 00:53:52,773
Sure.

706
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:53,954
Bill Carr, 47 Blakely Road.

707
00:53:56,295 --> 00:54:04,220
Back in 2000, I just want to talk about the fields, because I'm going to give maybe a little history of how it came about, and then where it is and where it needs to go.

708
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:09,563
So in 2000, I got together a committee, George Scott Pelley, Jay Shirami.

709
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:14,927
Emory, Callahan, Herwin, Sudirosa, Suzanne Higgins.

710
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:18,950
We got together down in South Medford, put together a team of people.

711
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:19,791
We had a big meeting.

712
00:54:19,811 --> 00:54:21,012
A lot of people were there.

713
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,674
And we decided to get something together.

714
00:54:23,734 --> 00:54:28,478
We started a 501c3, 401c3 nonprofit to raise money to see if the fields could even be built.

715
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,680
So we don't need to get all the history.

716
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,601
But we ended up going through the process.

717
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:35,784
And I did get a call.

718
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:41,937
Right at the very beginning, maybe six months in, we had raised about $50,000 privately to do the engineering to see if this would work.

719
00:54:43,357 --> 00:54:43,937
I got a call.

720
00:54:43,957 --> 00:54:51,219
There was a cell phone tower option at the field that was looked at, and no one wanted to touch it.

721
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,340
So I took it on with George and a few other people.

722
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:58,202
And we had a $1.6 million bid that went out.

723
00:54:58,222 --> 00:55:05,324
There was a $600,000 check written out to the city of Medford with $1 million to come back in over 10 years.

724
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:13,893
At that point, one person had complained that we were going to lose two parking spots.

725
00:55:14,473 --> 00:55:19,555
We had to move the cell phone tower down to another area and went back out to bid.

726
00:55:20,035 --> 00:55:21,075
That was in 2000, 2001.

727
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:24,936
And that's just about when the economy was starting to head down the tubes.

728
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:27,497
And when it went back out to bid, it came back at less.

729
00:55:27,617 --> 00:55:29,338
And then it went back out to bid.

730
00:55:29,378 --> 00:55:30,438
And then eventually nobody bid.

731
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:35,630
So the city of Medford really lost 1.6 million by moving it 100 feet to the right.

732
00:55:36,231 --> 00:55:37,272
But that's past history.

733
00:55:37,492 --> 00:55:38,853
We can go back and revisit that.

734
00:55:38,893 --> 00:55:42,396
That cell phone tower option is still available to the city today.

735
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:43,857
Nobody's taking it on.

736
00:55:44,037 --> 00:55:44,937
Maybe that's what we'll look at.

737
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:45,918
Maybe it's only worth 800,000.

738
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:48,580
So that's one option.

739
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,861
Anyway, the fields were built, 2,000.

740
00:55:52,163 --> 00:55:59,008
And when they would cut the deal with the council, in fact, Brianna, she was one of the first people to come forward and actually donate to the fields.

741
00:55:59,624 --> 00:56:00,804
Because I know, I got the check in the mail.

742
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:01,825
She was one of the first ones.

743
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:09,047
So the deal with the fields was the kids from the city of Medford, at the high school, had to have field priority.

744
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:12,828
They came first, whatever Bobby Maloney's needs were at that time.

745
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:14,589
The youth sports came second.

746
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:16,269
All the private organizations came third.

747
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:20,311
So I'm not sure about the Dome as far as, but maybe that rule should apply.

748
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:24,712
If there are needs for the kids in Medford, they've got to come first.

749
00:56:24,992 --> 00:56:26,013
And then the outside forces.

750
00:56:27,693 --> 00:56:30,194
Maybe an equal playing ground up there.

751
00:56:30,214 --> 00:56:31,914
But again, that company's a private company coming in.

752
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:33,335
They're looking to make as much money as they can.

753
00:56:35,255 --> 00:56:38,876
Anyway, so fast forward to this time.

754
00:56:39,556 --> 00:56:43,177
Seven, six years later, the fields last 10 to 15 years.

755
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:48,459
I did two years of study and research and all kinds of information I had to go get.

756
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:53,220
So they got 10 to 15 years is kind of the life cycle, but 15 on the outside.

757
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,361
But the fields over the last six years haven't been maintained properly.

758
00:56:58,062 --> 00:56:59,503
I'm not saying who's responsible.

759
00:56:59,523 --> 00:57:00,803
That's not really what I'm here for.

760
00:57:00,963 --> 00:57:02,424
They have not been groomed properly.

761
00:57:02,444 --> 00:57:05,285
You need to groom those fields two to four times a year.

762
00:57:05,805 --> 00:57:06,846
Do a GMAC study.

763
00:57:07,626 --> 00:57:10,947
Suck up all the pellets and all the dirt, and then put it back down.

764
00:57:10,987 --> 00:57:11,988
There's companies that do that.

765
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:12,828
That's about $10,000.

766
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,309
It hasn't been done yet.

767
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:21,552
So you guys want to put a dome over the field that has been maintained for six years, you can have all the domes you want.

768
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:26,854
If you don't maintain what's been there for six years, then we're going to be ripping that field up quicker than we need to.

769
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:30,122
So maybe that should be put in as the budget's coming up.

770
00:57:31,023 --> 00:57:32,524
Put the $10,000 in the school committee.

771
00:57:32,684 --> 00:57:33,985
Put it as a budget item.

772
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:37,768
Start doing it now so we can get 15 years, not 11.

773
00:57:38,368 --> 00:57:45,754
Because in five years from now, or six, or however long the longevity, if you do that GMAX, they'll tell you how long those fields will last once you do that study.

774
00:57:45,774 --> 00:57:47,876
And I believe that study's around $1,200 to do that.

775
00:57:48,696 --> 00:57:50,518
Then they'll tell you the length.

776
00:57:50,558 --> 00:57:53,140
And they'll also tell you how much it's going to cost to rip those up.

777
00:57:53,955 --> 00:57:57,676
which is approximately $400,000 to rip those fields up and put down two new fields.

778
00:57:58,596 --> 00:58:00,977
So that's going to have to happen very shortly.

779
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:11,359
What should happen, what the city should do, is take every hourly fee that's charged up there, whatever it is, $175 or $200 an hour, and add a user fee.

780
00:58:11,979 --> 00:58:13,560
Call it what you want, $20 an hour.

781
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,501
And the money should go to pay the bond, but that fee should go off.

782
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:23,302
So then in six years, when you need the $400,000, we're not going out to get another bond or trying to raise money to do that.

783
00:58:24,027 --> 00:58:27,049
So that should be put off to the side as a separate fee.

784
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:28,850
This is my opinion.

785
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:34,014
I'm not telling you how to do your job, but I'm just saying that should be done so that you're not going to be chasing that money in six or seven years.

786
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:41,099
The other option, if you go up there, because I designed the fields, when you go up the top of the stairs, you look to the left, you look to the right, there's a track.

787
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:45,342
And between the track and the edge of the fence is about a six foot area of grass.

788
00:58:45,863 --> 00:58:47,525
That grass was left there for one reason.

789
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:50,287
There's going to be alumni bricks going there, okay?

790
00:58:50,668 --> 00:58:52,009
That was a program that was all set up.

791
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,571
I had it all ready to go.

792
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:55,973
We had alumni lists all the way back to the 60s.

793
00:58:56,574 --> 00:59:01,479
We had approximately between a half million to a million dollars on alumni bricks that people wanted to buy.

794
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:07,345
Because you remember back in the 60s and 70s and even the 80s, Method Eye had classes of a thousand or better.

795
00:59:08,005 --> 00:59:08,546
Rick knows, right?

796
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:09,367
Okay.

797
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:14,694
That money, I was told that the alumni at the high school, they're going to have their own organization.

798
00:59:14,714 --> 00:59:16,194
And they would kind of run with that.

799
00:59:16,254 --> 00:59:17,434
But that never got off the ground.

800
00:59:17,454 --> 00:59:18,675
But that's still a viable option.

801
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:19,475
There's a lot of money.

802
00:59:19,855 --> 00:59:23,295
And a lot of families would buy a brick up there and mine both sides, left and right.

803
00:59:23,315 --> 00:59:26,076
There's enough room up there for 3,000 or 4,000 bricks.

804
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:28,996
That's so much per family brick or individual.

805
00:59:29,016 --> 00:59:29,977
You've seen them at Family Park.

806
00:59:29,997 --> 00:59:30,677
They're all over the place.

807
00:59:31,197 --> 00:59:34,557
And if it's a proud city, those bricks could be sold.

808
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:36,918
And I had the list all the way back 50 years.

809
00:59:37,773 --> 00:59:38,693
So that's another option.

810
00:59:39,134 --> 00:59:47,678
So there are ways to prepare for five or six years from here, from down the road, to rip these fields up and put new turf down.

811
00:59:48,178 --> 00:59:58,703
The other option that no one looked at, and when I was in the many negotiations with Mike McGlynn over the many times when we went back and forth on things, we had an option.

812
00:59:58,723 --> 01:00:01,865
We could have lights, or we could have had a third field off to the left.

813
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,967
The third field would be about a 60-yard field, half a football field.

814
01:00:06,397 --> 01:00:11,162
a 6 v 6 soccer field and maybe extend the parking lot out for a little more parking up top.

815
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:13,003
That would bring more rental in.

816
01:00:13,244 --> 01:00:15,886
So if you're going to rip it up, you're already there.

817
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:17,908
You can do another 60 yard.

818
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:19,970
That brings in another $150 an hour.

819
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:21,191
It's just grass.

820
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:22,252
It's just overgrown weeds.

821
01:00:22,712 --> 01:00:23,693
It's doing nothing up there.

822
01:00:23,713 --> 01:00:24,294
It's just sitting there.

823
01:00:24,314 --> 01:00:27,797
And all you have to do is put another bank of lights off to the left and come right on that field.

824
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:29,739
So those are the other options that we talked about.

825
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:31,120
So there's a lot of ways.

826
01:00:32,057 --> 01:00:37,039
And I'm not for or against the bubble because I haven't seen what they're actually trying to do.

827
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,941
But you can do all the bubbles you want.

828
01:00:40,361 --> 01:00:45,324
You need to look at out of the box and look at the other options for raising money besides the bubble.

829
01:00:45,344 --> 01:00:50,726
Remember, when you put a private company into a public school, there's a negative and a positive there.

830
01:00:51,086 --> 01:00:53,808
They're going to make money, but their main goal is to make money.

831
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:57,690
If they can give the money back to the city, let's use it.

832
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:58,890
Let's put a parking lot up there.

833
01:00:59,231 --> 01:00:59,931
Let's get rid of the

834
01:01:00,595 --> 01:01:03,696
Skateboard park, which is unsafe and in a bad location.

835
01:01:03,716 --> 01:01:06,077
Let's move that to another location and make parking up there.

836
01:01:06,137 --> 01:01:09,698
Move that to a location that's safer and more accessible and more visible for the kids.

837
01:01:10,238 --> 01:01:12,479
That's a bad spot for young kids up there right in the woods.

838
01:01:12,499 --> 01:01:14,279
That's not a good spot.

839
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:18,141
And you could put another 50 to 100 spots there easily and move that.

840
01:01:18,161 --> 01:01:21,042
They've been talking about moving that skateboard park for 10 years.

841
01:01:21,822 --> 01:01:23,862
So there's all these things that are going along.

842
01:01:24,423 --> 01:01:25,583
And now I hear about the bubble.

843
01:01:26,358 --> 01:01:29,599
I'm not, like I said, I'm not for or against it, but you've got all these other things that you're not looking at.

844
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,460
And that needs to be looked at by the city.

845
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:42,065
And, um, and I'd be happy to reinvestigate the cell phone tower since I know all the players and maybe it's at the time, George, right?

846
01:01:42,085 --> 01:01:42,805
We were there at the meeting.

847
01:01:43,746 --> 01:01:46,307
The guy flew up, the president of American towel flew up from Maryland.

848
01:01:46,747 --> 01:01:49,328
He says the fourth most valuable spot on the East coast.

849
01:01:50,189 --> 01:01:52,890
So that tells you that it's probably still a valuable spot.

850
01:01:53,442 --> 01:01:58,405
Maybe not the numbers they gave us were maybe a little inflated, but I think there's something there.

851
01:01:59,486 --> 01:02:00,227
And we did our study.

852
01:02:00,267 --> 01:02:03,249
We had an MIT people come in about the radiation.

853
01:02:03,609 --> 01:02:05,210
We had a meeting with all the neighbors.

854
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:06,311
They were all for it.

855
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:07,772
It was going to be a monopole with a flag.

856
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:08,872
It was going to be very well done.

857
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:10,534
And there's plenty of room to do it.

858
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:13,496
So that's something that I think you need to get behind.

859
01:02:15,877 --> 01:02:18,539
I have the history all the way through, so I kept all my records.

860
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:19,620
If you have any questions, if not,

861
01:02:20,648 --> 01:02:23,370
Those are all food for thought, but somebody's got to do some of this stuff, so.

862
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:25,531
Thank you, Mr. Carr.

863
01:02:25,551 --> 01:02:25,752
All right.

864
01:02:26,512 --> 01:02:28,293
Chair recognizes Vice President LaGuardia.

865
01:02:28,574 --> 01:02:29,674
Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

866
01:02:29,794 --> 01:02:31,716
So just take me back, Mr. Carr.

867
01:02:31,756 --> 01:02:34,858
Thank you for the education, especially with regards to the maintenance.

868
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:35,619
You can call me Bill.

869
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:36,239
My father's Mr. Carr.

870
01:02:36,259 --> 01:02:36,459
Bill.

871
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:37,000
That's fine.

872
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:42,063
The maintenance, I think, is what I kind of grabbed from what you discussed.

873
01:02:42,303 --> 01:02:43,964
And I obviously have a problem with it.

874
01:02:44,024 --> 01:02:49,168
And I think that's another reason why it's somewhat related to city business.

875
01:02:49,268 --> 01:02:50,309
We voted for a bond.

876
01:02:50,787 --> 01:02:53,088
And we asked that a maintenance budget be put aside.

877
01:02:53,428 --> 01:02:54,148
Same with the pool.

878
01:02:54,328 --> 01:02:56,249
We asked that 5% per year.

879
01:02:56,349 --> 01:02:57,689
I don't know if it was of the income.

880
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:02,411
I can be quoted probably differently than we actually wrote it down.

881
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:04,552
But there was supposed to be maintenance on the fields.

882
01:03:05,412 --> 01:03:06,512
So six years.

883
01:03:06,572 --> 01:03:08,413
Yes, it was supposed to be maintenance on the fields.

884
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:12,400
Medford does a horrible job with maintenance in the general sense.

885
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,623
Schools, streets, fields.

886
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:17,743
We don't do a good job.

887
01:03:17,783 --> 01:03:19,004
We don't have a good plan in place.

888
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:26,466
I don't think anybody here is in a position to speak about what the maintenance plan is at the field.

889
01:03:26,506 --> 01:03:29,988
I'm sure there is a maintenance plan in place, but I don't think anybody knows what it is.

890
01:03:30,248 --> 01:03:36,853
I mean, Billy, I know you well, but I question as to whether or not he knows whether or not they go out there and groom the field once a week or not.

891
01:03:36,973 --> 01:03:37,233
They do.

892
01:03:37,253 --> 01:03:37,793
You know what I mean?

893
01:03:38,954 --> 01:03:45,278
Actually, I can speak to that, because when I took over the fields, Mayor McGlynn said, I need somebody to run the fields.

894
01:03:45,499 --> 01:03:46,479
I volunteered for a year.

895
01:03:46,499 --> 01:03:47,460
I took the fields over.

896
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,080
I volunteered.

897
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:48,641
I make a dime.

898
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:49,581
I hired 10 people.

899
01:03:51,687 --> 01:03:55,751
a sweeping machine that just grooms the field.

900
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:57,432
And that's supposed to do that weekly.

901
01:03:57,452 --> 01:03:58,313
And those guys do that.

902
01:03:58,833 --> 01:03:59,794
That's what they're told to do.

903
01:04:00,634 --> 01:04:05,638
Then, apparently, Joe Crowley comes up, and he sweeps the fields twice a year.

904
01:04:05,919 --> 01:04:06,619
He's just sweeping.

905
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:08,280
It's not the deep cleaning.

906
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,962
It's not the cleansing that needs to happen.

907
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:12,384
It probably just was overlooked.

908
01:04:12,624 --> 01:04:14,165
I don't know who was responsible for getting that.

909
01:04:14,545 --> 01:04:15,666
But that's a budget item.

910
01:04:15,706 --> 01:04:20,290
That's money that has to be spent so those fields can get the extra five, six years we need.

911
01:04:20,955 --> 01:04:24,737
But I was going to say that they sit there and just don't get treated at all.

912
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:25,377
No, no, I didn't say that.

913
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:26,477
No, they get treated.

914
01:04:26,517 --> 01:04:28,138
I just said we don't do a good job with maintenance.

915
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:28,879
I know they get treated.

916
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:31,099
I actually, I was there.

917
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:32,820
The machine came in.

918
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,801
I know all about it.

919
01:04:33,861 --> 01:04:34,481
And it's been done.

920
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:35,621
The guy is doing a nice job up there.

921
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:39,623
In fact, the workers up there, and I know them all, they're all making $12 an hour.

922
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:40,924
They should be up to $15, by the way.

923
01:04:41,024 --> 01:04:43,085
Madam Vice President, Madam Vice President, you have the floor.

924
01:04:43,105 --> 01:04:45,706
But the deep cleaning they were supposed to do for $10,000 two to four times a year has never been done.

925
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:52,937
As far as I know, it's never been done.

926
01:04:53,137 --> 01:04:54,158
So it needs to be done.

927
01:04:54,398 --> 01:04:57,580
You can start as soon as the budget, you put a line item in there.

928
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,961
Let's do that so we can get some extra years out of this field.

929
01:04:59,981 --> 01:05:00,862
It's not anybody's fault.

930
01:05:01,102 --> 01:05:02,643
It just slipped through the cracks.

931
01:05:02,663 --> 01:05:04,524
No one saw it.

932
01:05:04,604 --> 01:05:08,666
They were grooming what they were told to do, but no one took the time to do the extra step.

933
01:05:08,706 --> 01:05:09,027
That's all.

934
01:05:09,047 --> 01:05:10,467
And they're trying to get some extra years out of it.

935
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:10,988
That's all.

936
01:05:11,048 --> 01:05:17,171
If I may amend my resolution just to ask what funding has been used to maintain the fields within the last three years?

937
01:05:18,862 --> 01:05:26,448
It's amended by council vice president current to include a question of what funding has been used.

938
01:05:26,688 --> 01:05:27,708
I believe it's council.

939
01:05:27,728 --> 01:05:28,349
Now you could well be.

940
01:05:28,489 --> 01:05:30,571
I think it's been twice a year with Joe Crowley.

941
01:05:30,591 --> 01:05:35,975
Crowley's purpose has been, has been grooming it doing a deeper sweep, but we need to do, we need to take it that extra step.

942
01:05:35,995 --> 01:05:36,335
That's all.

943
01:05:39,037 --> 01:05:41,218
Um, madam vice president has the floor still.

944
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:43,100
That's it for now.

945
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:43,420
Thank you.

946
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:45,502
Uh, counselor night.

947
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:46,002
Um,

948
01:05:46,586 --> 01:05:52,411
Mr. Carr was one of the first people, I was here, supporting the cause as a citizen back in, what was it, 2004, 2000?

949
01:05:52,771 --> 01:05:52,411
2000.

950
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:55,913
2000, 2000, the year 2000.

951
01:05:56,293 --> 01:06:00,637
And if I remember correctly, the fields were opened up in 2002?

952
01:06:00,857 --> 01:06:01,197
Fall of 2000.

953
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:02,818
Fall of 2000.

954
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:06,802
The barn was approved in February of 2000.

955
01:06:06,882 --> 01:06:09,303
The fields opened in September of 2000.

956
01:06:10,024 --> 01:06:12,426
So we're at year 16 now, anyway.

957
01:06:12,466 --> 01:06:13,847
So I think the shelf life on the field, no?

958
01:06:16,075 --> 01:06:16,956
2010, excuse me.

959
01:06:16,996 --> 01:06:18,576
Yeah, it was going to say, yeah.

960
01:06:18,677 --> 01:06:20,097
It was like, that doesn't, 2010, February, 2010.

961
01:06:20,137 --> 01:06:20,317
Yeah.

962
01:06:20,437 --> 01:06:24,339
And then we open it now, fall of 2010, excuse me.

963
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,160
I'm off by 10.

964
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,001
So 2008, it went out 2010 and opened.

965
01:06:27,021 --> 01:06:29,282
We're heading into our seventh, we're heading into our seventh year.

966
01:06:29,462 --> 01:06:29,942
Seventh year.

967
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:30,423
Yes.

968
01:06:30,603 --> 01:06:30,863
Okay.

969
01:06:34,085 --> 01:06:35,425
All right.

970
01:06:35,806 --> 01:06:36,406
Thank you very much.

971
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:36,726
Thank you.

972
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:38,267
Councilor Scarpelli.

973
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:39,427
Just, just to follow up.

974
01:06:39,507 --> 01:06:42,469
I know this is, this is what a part of what I do for a living.

975
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:44,230
So, um,

976
01:06:45,642 --> 01:06:57,634
To be honest with everyone here, the maintenance of a field, what was true to be a maintenance of a field was the vacuuming two times a year by Joe Crowley and what they do.

977
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:07,964
I personally met with a company last week that has a true understanding of what you're supposed to do, and they would come in to do all the tests that are needed.

978
01:07:08,404 --> 01:07:19,047
And one test that's very important is a concussion impact test, whether our facilities are safe enough for our kids because of the pellets, what's added, what's not added.

979
01:07:19,447 --> 01:07:28,750
And it's something to the point where there was quoted for us was $6,000 and they would come in and what they would do is the true maintenance where they would suck up all the pellets,

980
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:35,556
re-sweep the fibers so they're upright again, and then re-enter the pellets.

981
01:07:36,097 --> 01:07:44,605
And then with that, you would get a certified study that would make sure that you are covered by insurance and so on.

982
01:07:44,705 --> 01:07:51,252
So that's something, as we move forward, I know that one of the things we talked about and one of the things Mr. Carr said,

983
01:07:52,213 --> 01:08:04,341
When I talked to some of the school committee members, they're also coming out Monday with a detailed plan of all the facilities and funding and what each facility would cost.

984
01:08:04,802 --> 01:08:11,286
I personally think that we in Somerville, what we charge is $185 per hour flat fee.

985
01:08:11,907 --> 01:08:19,072
And that's something that I would like to see the school committee look at maybe increasing the fee for non-resident programs.

986
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:34,523
So, the BSSCs, the club soccer programs that make money, that come in and fund that to help pay for maintenance and pay for turf recovery as we move forward.

987
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:43,330
This is what we're doing and we hope that as Monday's meeting comes out, would spell out a lot of what we're trying to think of.

988
01:08:45,404 --> 01:09:01,156
This is easy, and I point back to a resolution I made last week, this is easy when you have a recreation department that oversees the fields, the maintenance, the budgeting, the rentals, the employees, soup to nuts.

989
01:09:02,197 --> 01:09:08,122
When we have one person doing six jobs, this is where it's difficult.

990
01:09:08,182 --> 01:09:13,206
So it's gonna come time that we should, and I'm anxious to see what we,

991
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:19,509
have for a recreation plan going forward, but it's going to be interesting to see where we're going to go with this because.

992
01:09:21,172 --> 01:09:29,559
I want us to look outside the box and think maybe sometimes spending a little money is going to save us a lot of money as we move forward.

993
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:32,321
So again, I appreciate Mr. Carr.

994
01:09:32,341 --> 01:09:33,282
I know everything you've done.

995
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:41,588
I will tell you what I've been told what's done at Medford High School is something very important to me, many different levels.

996
01:09:41,828 --> 01:09:43,450
I was part of this program when it started.

997
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:46,912
My son will be playing at the high school in a few years.

998
01:09:47,373 --> 01:09:49,294
It's very important that we do the right thing.

999
01:09:50,744 --> 01:09:55,166
hope that there's safe turf and safe fields for our kids to play on for years to come.

1000
01:09:55,206 --> 01:10:00,908
So I would love to share what I know with the school committee with plans.

1001
01:10:00,968 --> 01:10:06,089
And it's not $10,000, it's $6,000 per field for the whole plan.

1002
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:15,433
And that's every season coming in, doing two deep cleanings, doing two vacuums that what Crowley does now, and sweeping and adding pellets when needed.

1003
01:10:15,853 --> 01:10:18,554
So it's a pretty intricate system.

1004
01:10:20,067 --> 01:10:20,787
Thank you for listening.

1005
01:10:21,087 --> 01:10:21,927
Thank you, Counselor.

1006
01:10:21,947 --> 01:10:23,288
Chair recognizes Counselor Max.

1007
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:24,968
Thank you, Mr. President.

1008
01:10:24,988 --> 01:10:27,569
I want to thank Bill Carr Jr.

1009
01:10:27,609 --> 01:10:28,409
for coming up tonight.

1010
01:10:29,609 --> 01:10:37,451
He was one of the biggest advocates that I recall back in the days when the field of dreams was in its infancy.

1011
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:42,912
And, you know, I just want to say, Mr. President, that we're discussing a bubble top.

1012
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:48,474
And in my opinion, we should be discussing books in the schools that are 25 years old.

1013
01:10:50,057 --> 01:10:54,000
We should be discussing the fact that teachers don't have proper supplies.

1014
01:10:54,641 --> 01:10:58,904
We should be discussing the deplorable condition of the restrooms at the high school.

1015
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:06,630
I'd venture to say probably 60 or 70% of the bathrooms in the high school are physically locked because they're in deplorable condition.

1016
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:09,932
The water fountains don't work throughout the high school.

1017
01:11:09,972 --> 01:11:14,276
And that may be a good thing because of lead pipes that we have throughout this community.

1018
01:11:14,756 --> 01:11:16,737
So that may be a positive thing that they're not working.

1019
01:11:17,278 --> 01:11:18,219
We have a leaky roof.

1020
01:11:19,068 --> 01:11:25,892
I was up there several weeks ago watching my son play a basketball game, and they had to navigate between barrels because the roof was leaking.

1021
01:11:26,653 --> 01:11:28,514
These are the issues we should be discussing.

1022
01:11:28,914 --> 01:11:33,237
And in my opinion, I'm not pro or con of a bubble top.

1023
01:11:33,277 --> 01:11:34,417
I haven't seen the proposal.

1024
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:46,965
But I could just tell you from firsthand experience, serving as a member of the school committee, that when we had the swimming pool up and running back some years ago, and the lack of resources, and the lack of upkeep on the pool,

1025
01:11:47,384 --> 01:11:54,650
and we rented it out to all the surrounding neighborhood communities to use our Olympic-sized swimming pool, over the years it deteriorated.

1026
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:59,073
And we got to a point where we couldn't use the swimming pool for I think it was roughly eight years.

1027
01:11:59,613 --> 01:12:02,395
That went unused because of the lack of maintenance.

1028
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:06,098
It was great to rent it out, and God knows where that rental money went.

1029
01:12:06,438 --> 01:12:08,100
It sure didn't go back into the swimming pool.

1030
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,861
But that's the issue I have.

1031
01:12:10,181 --> 01:12:11,442
You know, rentals sound great.

1032
01:12:11,462 --> 01:12:13,564
Bringing in outside money sounds great.

1033
01:12:14,408 --> 01:12:18,832
You know, we've been renting out the high school every Saturday for the past 25 years.

1034
01:12:19,213 --> 01:12:22,175
There's over 700 people every Saturday.

1035
01:12:22,716 --> 01:12:26,479
I'd ask anyone in the community to go up, and you can't get a pocket spot up at the high school.

1036
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,603
And it's a great program they run up there, the Japanese Language Arts Program.

1037
01:12:31,164 --> 01:12:33,566
And they have complete run of the entire high school.

1038
01:12:34,567 --> 01:12:35,648
However, Mr. President,

1039
01:12:36,207 --> 01:12:50,329
I don't see any benefits over the years that we can say, well, this program has put on a new roof, or this program repaved the parking lot, or this program helped us do X, Y, and Z. I have yet to see any of that, Mr. President.

1040
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:57,031
And it's great to rent out the high school and our middle school and the pool and the field of dreams, and that's great.

1041
01:12:57,691 --> 01:13:04,892
But without, as Mr. Carr mentioned and Councilor Longo, without the proper maintenance, which this city has a poor track record,

1042
01:13:05,546 --> 01:13:09,591
We're going to be putting good money after bad money after renting these facilities out.

1043
01:13:10,371 --> 01:13:15,537
And I, as one member of this council, I remember the bond funding that needed for the Field of Dreams.

1044
01:13:16,378 --> 01:13:21,424
And I, as one member of this council, Mr. President, rather see the local use.

1045
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:23,747
Yeah, we might not make as much on it.

1046
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:24,087
You're right.

1047
01:13:24,486 --> 01:13:31,288
It may not be, but we're not in the business in this community to make money, to rent out fields.

1048
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:32,829
Let's rent City Hall out.

1049
01:13:33,269 --> 01:13:36,710
I mean, we're not in the business of renting facilities in this community.

1050
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,450
We're not in the rental business.

1051
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:50,254
I want to make sure the fields are there, the fields are safe, and they're in great user condition for our athletes, for our students, for our intramural teams, and so forth.

1052
01:13:50,554 --> 01:13:54,115
That's what I'm concerned about, not renting it out to these outside

1053
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:58,657
places that have no affiliation, just want to use it as a space.

1054
01:13:59,278 --> 01:14:03,381
And I don't know, Mr. President, I have a lot of reservations with that.

1055
01:14:03,661 --> 01:14:07,644
You know, the determination is up to the school committee, and good luck to them.

1056
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:11,567
Apparently, they don't need any money from this council, so they're going off on their own.

1057
01:14:12,267 --> 01:14:13,008
And good luck to them.

1058
01:14:13,068 --> 01:14:15,310
But, you know, let's take a look at the high school.

1059
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,952
Let's get our current needs underway.

1060
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:22,235
If that high school was ship-shaped, Mr. President, I wouldn't even have made this speech tonight.

1061
01:14:22,861 --> 01:14:30,465
But I can tell you firsthand, having two children at the high school — I don't know when the last time you've been up to high school, but I have two children that go there on a daily basis.

1062
01:14:31,246 --> 01:14:39,890
And when they don't have a restroom to attend, when the bubbler doesn't work, when books they come home with look like they're from ancient Egypt, there's a problem, Mr. President.

1063
01:14:40,251 --> 01:14:43,052
There's a problem with what's going on for the basic necessities.

1064
01:14:43,432 --> 01:14:48,355
And when teachers can't muster together paper and pencil and the basics, there's a concern.

1065
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:51,857
So, I thank Mr. Carr for coming up.

1066
01:14:52,294 --> 01:14:54,055
And I thank Councilor Longo for putting this on.

1067
01:14:54,475 --> 01:14:59,099
And I think we should all be getting a copy of this RFP or draft of the RFP, whatever it is.

1068
01:14:59,559 --> 01:15:02,901
So we're informed when we get the calls from residents.

1069
01:15:03,522 --> 01:15:04,402
Thank you, Councilor.

1070
01:15:04,702 --> 01:15:06,283
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

1071
01:15:06,403 --> 01:15:07,404
Thank you, Mr. President.

1072
01:15:08,305 --> 01:15:14,089
As we all know, I think maintenance has been the Achilles heel of this whole city over for many years.

1073
01:15:14,989 --> 01:15:18,712
And Councilor Marks is right.

1074
01:15:18,732 --> 01:15:19,692
We rent out the school.

1075
01:15:19,712 --> 01:15:20,493
We rent out everything.

1076
01:15:21,426 --> 01:15:21,966
It's everybody.

1077
01:15:22,026 --> 01:15:29,149
And I agree, you know, we come up with some creative findings to get the bubble thing out of the box.

1078
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:35,851
Time we start thinking out of the box to take some of this, like I said, take some of this rental money, reinvest it back into the community.

1079
01:15:35,871 --> 01:15:47,215
As I said, the money from the Saturday rentals at the high school, some of that money should be going back into the high school to do repairs.

1080
01:15:48,055 --> 01:15:50,136
You know, no one even mentioned the new field at

1081
01:15:51,835 --> 01:15:56,957
And we only talked about the field up at the high school.

1082
01:15:56,977 --> 01:15:58,857
I don't know what we've done over there.

1083
01:15:59,478 --> 01:16:10,622
So I'm sure that needs the same, if there's been, the attention has been lacking over there, I'm assuming that the same attention is lacking at Palmdale Stadium too, am I correct?

1084
01:16:10,682 --> 01:16:15,303
You would know, I mean, I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's expertise.

1085
01:16:17,184 --> 01:16:20,025
Yeah, I mean, I think we get too many

1086
01:16:21,337 --> 01:16:25,219
I think we got maybe too many groups, um, all fighting in different ways.

1087
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:35,042
I think it's a, I think it's about time that we, uh, we come together on the one roof, but everybody, so we can, and maybe develop a solid plan, uh, to move forward on these type of projects.

1088
01:16:35,062 --> 01:16:35,522
Mr. President.

1089
01:16:38,663 --> 01:16:39,043
Thank you.

1090
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:43,885
Counselor Caviello chair recognizes counselor Scott Pelley.

1091
01:16:44,585 --> 01:16:46,206
If I can, I, I, again, I, I,

1092
01:16:46,811 --> 01:17:04,536
I applaud my colleagues, this is a very hot topic, this is a very important topic, and I think that's something we all recognize, and what I recognized six years ago on the school committee, is the lack of a maintenance plan that needs to be in place, and I think that we should be working on that.

1093
01:17:04,836 --> 01:17:13,359
But if we can recall back some odd years ago, and I think Mr. Carr can attest, the reason why we did these fields, and the reason why we could do these fields,

1094
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:18,144
at the time it wasn't going to be funded by the taxpayer.

1095
01:17:18,505 --> 01:17:32,481
The whole idea was a grassroots effort by the community to come out and make sure that our kids that were playing on dangerous fields at the time were going to play on safe fields and given the opportunity for our community.

1096
01:17:32,841 --> 01:17:33,963
And the only way to do that

1097
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:42,912
The realistic way to do that is to strike a balance where there was rentals and giving our opportunity for our kids to play on those fields.

1098
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:45,415
And that was the only way that there was the balance.

1099
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:50,880
Unfortunately, to say that we would go and just build this and make it happen wasn't going to happen.

1100
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:51,781
We know it.

1101
01:17:52,321 --> 01:17:52,802
We lived it.

1102
01:17:54,001 --> 01:17:56,083
There was no way the administration was going to let that happen.

1103
01:17:56,483 --> 01:18:01,407
So we had to look at that, think outside the box, be creative, so our kids weren't playing on a dangerous field.

1104
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:01,947
Because you know what?

1105
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:05,830
Most of that time, those fields were closed because they were dangerous.

1106
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:07,011
Let's not forget that.

1107
01:18:08,072 --> 01:18:18,479
To say that, you know, and not putting words in my colleague's mouth, but looking at books and looking at pens and pencils and paper,

1108
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:21,020
To me, that's not fair.

1109
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:27,005
For six years, I was on the school committee making sure that, trying to make sure we had checks and balances.

1110
01:18:27,725 --> 01:18:29,407
We never let a teacher go.

1111
01:18:30,228 --> 01:18:34,451
Our classroom size is the best in the commonwealth, and our programs are thriving.

1112
01:18:35,312 --> 01:18:38,875
We have a beautiful science building, we have a beautiful pool, we have a beautiful place.

1113
01:18:38,915 --> 01:18:41,997
Now, don't get me wrong, there are definitely issues there.

1114
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:43,759
Bubblers, you're right.

1115
01:18:44,039 --> 01:18:44,900
Bathrooms, you're right.

1116
01:18:46,381 --> 01:18:48,402
But I'd love to see a maintenance plan moving forward.

1117
01:18:48,862 --> 01:18:50,723
Counsel, you're correct, a thousand percent.

1118
01:18:51,423 --> 01:18:55,244
But to insinuate one rather than the other, it's not fair.

1119
01:18:55,945 --> 01:18:58,045
We needed these fields to work.

1120
01:18:58,446 --> 01:19:04,348
And the only way to make them work is find a balance from outside and what we have inside.

1121
01:19:05,388 --> 01:19:11,931
And talking to these youth organizations, our youth organizations, sure, they'd like to be there every single night and play for free.

1122
01:19:12,432 --> 01:19:16,554
But the realistic issues are, if we wanted them, this is what we needed to do.

1123
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:27,694
And this wasn't George Scott Pelley's school committee member, this wasn't George Scott Pelley's city councilor, this was George Scott Pelley, a parent of a child that wanted to make sure that our kids played on safe fields.

1124
01:19:28,074 --> 01:19:31,216
That's what Billy Carr started back then, and this is what we went forward.

1125
01:19:31,636 --> 01:19:46,045
Now as we're moving forward, and you're talking in a bubble, whether it works or whether it doesn't, whether the RFP goes through, whether it doesn't, I applaud at least an effort that's creative, that's not coming out of taxpayers' pockets,

1126
01:19:46,988 --> 01:19:51,251
to pay for turf that will be replaced within eight years.

1127
01:19:53,393 --> 01:19:54,334
Because that's going to happen.

1128
01:19:54,434 --> 01:20:13,689
Because in eight years, if we don't think outside the box, if we don't think of a maintenance plan to put in place so we can identify funding that goes directly to the replacement, we're going to be sitting here in eight years, hopefully, and we're going to be talking about where are we going to come up with $500,000 for each field at the time to replace a turf.

1129
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:15,991
That's all I'm saying.

1130
01:20:17,118 --> 01:20:18,159
That's why I applaud that.

1131
01:20:18,519 --> 01:20:19,901
This is what neighboring communities do.

1132
01:20:21,182 --> 01:20:21,743
So thank you.

1133
01:20:25,807 --> 01:20:27,088
Thank you, Mr. President.

1134
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:34,436
So I have received a couple of calls and questions about this bubble project, and I think it's interesting.

1135
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:39,058
I think it has potential.

1136
01:20:39,978 --> 01:20:42,579
But I do believe preventive maintenance is the key.

1137
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:56,124
I mean, when I was on the school committee, one of the big things advocates I was for is maintaining and making sure that we maintain our buildings and make sure we basically provide preventive maintenance on a yearly basis.

1138
01:20:56,865 --> 01:20:59,566
And back in 2010, when I was first elected,

1139
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:05,091
I remember that was when I think Paul Edwards at the time came before us.

1140
01:21:05,131 --> 01:21:11,194
He was the building and director, the school's buildings and directors, director.

1141
01:21:12,054 --> 01:21:13,575
And I said, what are we doing for preventive maintenance?

1142
01:21:14,335 --> 01:21:15,296
He said, we're doing nothing.

1143
01:21:15,416 --> 01:21:16,296
We don't have money in the budget.

1144
01:21:18,497 --> 01:21:22,639
It was a rolling plan, if you remember, John.

1145
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,121
They were doing this as they go, which is wasn't possible.

1146
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:30,063
But I mean, I will say, some people may disagree.

1147
01:21:30,587 --> 01:21:33,189
over time, that has improved a bit.

1148
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:36,351
I mean, we've actually made some progress in that area.

1149
01:21:36,751 --> 01:21:40,933
For example, filters getting changed on a regular basis, whereas before, there were issues.

1150
01:21:41,013 --> 01:21:44,656
So I mean, preventive maintenance is the key to any project.

1151
01:21:45,196 --> 01:21:47,597
In a project like this, it has to be the key.

1152
01:21:47,978 --> 01:21:49,078
I mean, I remember Field of Dreams.

1153
01:21:49,138 --> 01:21:50,719
It was the first thing I voted on.

1154
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:56,483
It was the first issue that came before us when we were elected in 2010, was voting for the Field of Dreams.

1155
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:59,605
I still think today it's a good vote.

1156
01:21:59,705 --> 01:22:00,305
It's a great vote.

1157
01:22:00,861 --> 01:22:06,537
Um, you know, and I think that we have to think about when we think about education, we think of students, we have to think about well rounded students.

1158
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:07,701
We need to make sure.

1159
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:12,609
you know, we, we provide, uh, things both inside the classroom and outside the classroom.

1160
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:14,851
And I, I understand your, you know, about the books.

1161
01:22:15,311 --> 01:22:17,533
We do need to make sure our books are current 25 years.

1162
01:22:17,553 --> 01:22:20,055
I, I, I didn't know we had any of that old.

1163
01:22:20,195 --> 01:22:23,478
I knew we do have some old textbooks, but I didn't think they were that old.

1164
01:22:23,498 --> 01:22:32,266
But, um, and I'd love to know what class we can talk afterwards, but I'd love to know what class has those because we need to get the school committee needs to know that those have to be replaced.

1165
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:33,587
But, um,

1166
01:22:34,733 --> 01:22:37,415
But, I mean, it's, you know, we want to make sure we have well-rounded students.

1167
01:22:37,575 --> 01:22:46,421
The fields are a great example of how we, our children and our students, can actually use, you know, get physical activity through sports and recreation.

1168
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:49,683
And it's important that we have, you know, state-of-the-art facilities to do that.

1169
01:22:50,404 --> 01:22:53,146
But for me, you know, it comes down to preventive maintenance.

1170
01:22:53,326 --> 01:23:01,752
And what I'd like to see is, you know, and if I could amend the resolution, is just to receive a business plan from the school committee as to what they're going to do as far as

1171
01:23:02,223 --> 01:23:07,870
you know, how much is going to be charged, the plans to rent it out, I mean, how much is being set aside for preventive maintenance.

1172
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:11,554
So if we could add that to the resolution, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1173
01:23:13,136 --> 01:23:13,296
Add.

1174
01:23:15,118 --> 01:23:22,727
If we get the school committee could give us the proposed business plan for the fields with regard to, um, you know,

1175
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:27,853
with your charging the cost, how much is going back to preventive maintenance, basically the plan.

1176
01:23:27,893 --> 01:23:28,554
What's the plan?

1177
01:23:28,634 --> 01:23:34,981
I mean, I know we talked a little bit about the hours, you know, who's gonna be renting it out if possible.

1178
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:39,005
I mean, that type of thing, the type of programming that's gonna be offered.

1179
01:23:39,366 --> 01:23:39,706
Thank you.

1180
01:23:40,146 --> 01:23:40,447
Thank you.

1181
01:23:43,033 --> 01:24:11,143
So on the motion of Vice President Lungo Kern, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be given a draft copy of the edited and updated RFP that will be voted on by the Medford School Committee regarding the leasing of the Edgeley Field with, as amended, a report to convey to us the funding that has been used over the years for the maintenance of the fields, and secondly,

1182
01:24:12,486 --> 01:24:20,133
amended by Councilor Falco that the proposed business plan be included in that communique.

1183
01:24:20,713 --> 01:24:27,859
We have a citizen who wishes to readdress us.

1184
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:29,221
Just one more question.

1185
01:24:29,241 --> 01:24:33,644
I've asked for the last couple of months, and maybe Councilor, I'll let you know.

1186
01:24:34,451 --> 01:24:38,735
How much money has come in on a yearly basis to the two fields behind Medford High School?

1187
01:24:38,995 --> 01:24:40,256
Exact dollar figure.

1188
01:24:40,316 --> 01:24:42,918
No one seems to get, no one knows that answer.

1189
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:46,261
I've asked everybody from the top, no one.

1190
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:51,045
I'm sorry, you can finish.

1191
01:24:51,365 --> 01:24:57,510
Maybe we should group this with resolution that I put on 16.475 in which I asked the very same question.

1192
01:24:57,691 --> 01:24:59,072
It's a little late for that, isn't it?

1193
01:25:07,462 --> 01:25:08,703
I have that answer at my house.

1194
01:25:11,865 --> 01:25:13,767
I'll let someone else speak.

1195
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:17,469
My statement as far as the city doesn't do a good job, it's not anybody's fault.

1196
01:25:17,970 --> 01:25:22,713
It's an oversight that happens through many of the projects in the city and many of the situations.

1197
01:25:22,753 --> 01:25:23,834
We don't do a good job.

1198
01:25:24,234 --> 01:25:31,579
We can stop it and get a $10,000 budget line item in this year so we can start doing the fields properly so we can get the years.

1199
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:36,423
If I come back here in three years and we're still not doing it right, you're going to hear it.

1200
01:25:37,178 --> 01:25:38,742
And it's going to be embarrassing.

1201
01:25:39,323 --> 01:25:41,048
So we don't want to get to that point.

1202
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:44,717
Let's do the right thing and keep them going for the next five or six years, probably.

1203
01:25:48,445 --> 01:25:49,405
Good evening, citizen.

1204
01:25:49,505 --> 01:25:51,346
Please state your name and address for the record.

1205
01:25:51,586 --> 01:25:52,506
My name is Robert Penter.

1206
01:25:52,526 --> 01:25:54,346
I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

1207
01:25:54,547 --> 01:25:55,947
I'm a member of the Saugus party.

1208
01:25:56,607 --> 01:25:58,227
My take on this is just a little bit different.

1209
01:25:58,507 --> 01:26:01,568
We can talk about the maintenance, and it's quite obvious that the maintenance is an issue.

1210
01:26:02,128 --> 01:26:05,249
But I'd like to get into the legality of the bond in and of itself.

1211
01:26:05,809 --> 01:26:08,650
When the city of Medford went out for the bond in this particular field,

1212
01:26:11,715 --> 01:26:13,536
Point of information, Counselor Knight.

1213
01:26:13,656 --> 01:26:15,237
I'm going to get into the legality of matters.

1214
01:26:15,297 --> 01:26:19,861
I think I'd feel more comfortable if the city solicitor were present and able to provide us with that type of advice.

1215
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:21,041
I would, too.

1216
01:26:21,282 --> 01:26:27,085
Mr. President, my purpose of saying the legality of it is because I would like to ask a question, and I think it needs to be answered.

1217
01:26:27,506 --> 01:26:28,566
The question is very simple.

1218
01:26:28,607 --> 01:26:29,927
The City of Meffitt owns the property.

1219
01:26:30,808 --> 01:26:34,811
Now, will the City of Meffitt own the dome that the renter wants to come in?

1220
01:26:35,511 --> 01:26:40,995
And if that's the situation, I think it changes the whole intent of what the City of Meffitt's bond was all about.

1221
01:26:41,533 --> 01:26:49,581
and that bond being for the exclusive use, again, of the fields, Medford folks and students first, and however the rentals take place.

1222
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:59,170
But you're now building a bond, and now you want to build a bubble, and the bubble will declare an ownership of authority of the person that has it, and the city of Medford will not have priority of the use of those fields.

1223
01:26:59,791 --> 01:27:05,737
So I would hope one of you folks on the council would make that request to our city solicitor to ask him

1224
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:17,024
if in fact this is even legal to do and what authority, if anything, does the city or will they have over the dome itself for the purposes of liability and for the purposes of its use?

1225
01:27:17,444 --> 01:27:19,184
I think it's an important question to ask.

1226
01:27:20,025 --> 01:27:22,646
I have no problem with the bubble, whether it goes or doesn't go.

1227
01:27:22,906 --> 01:27:25,747
I think you need to have this legal question as it relates to this particular matter.

1228
01:27:26,767 --> 01:27:27,127
Thank you.

1229
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:28,968
So I would hope somebody.

1230
01:27:28,988 --> 01:27:33,889
I can move that question, Mr. President.

1231
01:27:33,909 --> 01:27:35,790
Please state the question, Councilor Marks.

1232
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:39,091
The question is the liability of the bubble.

1233
01:27:39,131 --> 01:27:43,453
Who would be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the bubble?

1234
01:27:44,553 --> 01:27:48,415
In case of some type of disaster, what would happen?

1235
01:27:48,455 --> 01:27:50,136
Would the City of Meffitt be responsible?

1236
01:27:50,756 --> 01:27:52,057
Who maintains ownership?

1237
01:27:53,077 --> 01:27:56,118
On the motion of Councilor Night, there is an additional, sir.

1238
01:27:56,518 --> 01:27:56,939
Also one.

1239
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:57,839
Sir.

1240
01:27:57,859 --> 01:27:59,079
Yes.

1241
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:01,741
Councilors may only introduce motions on this floor.

1242
01:28:02,581 --> 01:28:04,802
Only councilors may introduce motions on this floor.

1243
01:28:05,706 --> 01:28:08,228
I'm trying to clarify the motion, if you'd give me the courtesy.

1244
01:28:10,109 --> 01:28:23,537
Also, the fact of the matter is, does this interfere with the bond that originally was written, therefore allowing, as such right now, the city of Method entertaining a private entity to come in, use its field for its particular purpose, the dome?

1245
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:25,419
I think that question needs to be asked.

1246
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:27,640
Thank you.

1247
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:29,862
So moved, Mr. President, that that be asked.

1248
01:28:30,382 --> 01:28:32,043
And you can review that on tape, if you'd like.

1249
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:38,370
Good evening.

1250
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:40,531
Please state your name and address for the record.

1251
01:28:40,991 --> 01:28:42,412
My name is Carolyn Jones.

1252
01:28:42,512 --> 01:28:44,353
I live at 32 Arlington Street.

1253
01:28:46,174 --> 01:28:59,100
I was sitting back listening to the conversation particularly about this dome and the field versus the educational side of public schools in Medford.

1254
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:07,264
And I think that the conversation sort of got askew because it's really very necessary

1255
01:29:07,995 --> 01:29:18,742
for the students to have a place where they can be active, since I don't think that they really have that many gym courses that get them out to be active.

1256
01:29:18,982 --> 01:29:22,844
But I think more important than that is the education that they get.

1257
01:29:23,585 --> 01:29:26,627
I taught at Medford High School eons ago.

1258
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:29,488
I only taught for one year.

1259
01:29:30,309 --> 01:29:33,351
The reason why I only taught for one year is that I'm a shoe freak.

1260
01:29:34,253 --> 01:29:45,716
And I had all of these shoes, and standing on my feet, my shoes, my feet grew like a size larger, and I said, I can't do this every year if I have to buy new shoes.

1261
01:29:46,817 --> 01:29:50,898
And so I decided to move on, and I went into the private sector.

1262
01:29:51,518 --> 01:30:01,181
But one of the things that disturbed me when I taught was that the, I taught history and civics, and the books were antiquated.

1263
01:30:02,356 --> 01:30:08,262
And so I had some relatives who were educators, and they didn't live in Massachusetts.

1264
01:30:08,783 --> 01:30:16,591
And I said, what books can you send me that I can use to teach civics and history in a way that I want the students to understand it?

1265
01:30:17,933 --> 01:30:19,434
And they sent me some books.

1266
01:30:19,594 --> 01:30:24,820
Now, they sent me books for me to use, so that meant that I had to spend more time developing

1267
01:30:26,568 --> 01:30:28,789
the script for the courses that I taught.

1268
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:37,092
And my classroom was next door to the senior submaster's office.

1269
01:30:38,112 --> 01:30:46,255
And I was told that that was where they put first year teachers because he thought that they could not control themselves or the class.

1270
01:30:47,156 --> 01:30:51,057
And about halfway through the year, he came and he stood in the back of my class

1271
01:30:51,951 --> 01:30:55,653
At the end of the class, I said, is there something I can help you with?

1272
01:30:55,733 --> 01:30:58,675
And he said, I never hear any noise coming from your class.

1273
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:02,217
And I said, that's because you're not supposed to hear any noise.

1274
01:31:03,277 --> 01:31:14,704
And I developed my own curriculum for what I taught the students that I thought would keep them interested in history and civics, because I know that that's not

1275
01:31:15,647 --> 01:31:18,008
those are not classes that most students liked.

1276
01:31:18,408 --> 01:31:22,330
Unfortunately, when I was in high school, those were my favorite classes.

1277
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:42,599
I think that Medford High School, all of Medford schools, need to keep up in terms of the books that you use, the curriculum that you help the teachers design, whether they do it on their own, whether they do it collectively.

1278
01:31:45,765 --> 01:31:57,936
I was just disturbed by the conversation that it was like either you get new books and the teachers don't have to buy their own paper and pencils or you put in this big dome.

1279
01:31:58,337 --> 01:32:04,743
I mean there must be some way that you can talk about it collectively and come up with

1280
01:32:05,263 --> 01:32:08,984
a solution that provides both things.

1281
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:16,786
And for myself, I mean, I think that things that are around athletics are important.

1282
01:32:17,326 --> 01:32:26,908
But if there was one choice, I would make the choice that it go towards the academic side, because that's what the students are going to need when they graduate from school.

1283
01:32:27,548 --> 01:32:34,310
And if they haven't gotten the basics while they're in school, they're not really going to get a good job or get into college once they get out of school.

1284
01:32:35,003 --> 01:32:37,624
So that is all I have to say.

1285
01:32:37,644 --> 01:32:40,905
I hope that you'll take what I've said under advisement.

1286
01:32:41,346 --> 01:32:48,048
And if you need any more information from me, you can give me a call.

1287
01:32:48,548 --> 01:32:52,350
Some of the people who come down to the West Memphis Community Center know me from there.

1288
01:32:53,512 --> 01:32:57,513
So, Councilman Falco and his partner.

1289
01:32:57,593 --> 01:33:05,295
I think I've seen you before, Councilman Marks, but I didn't know what your name was, but I do know those two.

1290
01:33:05,315 --> 01:33:09,097
Huh?

1291
01:33:09,117 --> 01:33:10,797
Thank you.

1292
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:12,137
Thank you.

1293
01:33:12,758 --> 01:33:13,778
Thank you very much.

1294
01:33:14,358 --> 01:33:21,060
So on the motion of Vice President Lungel-Kern, as amended by Vice President Lungel-Kern, Falco and Marks,

1295
01:33:21,828 --> 01:33:23,529
Roll call vote has been requested.

1296
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:36,260
No.

1297
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,262
With the vote of four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

1298
01:33:41,144 --> 01:33:42,785
Motion for suspension of the rules.

1299
01:33:42,845 --> 01:33:46,028
Can we take, we have two cab drivers here to have quick business.

1300
01:33:54,377 --> 01:33:56,759
No, one was tabled and one was.

1301
01:34:00,822 --> 01:34:15,633
On the motion of Councilor, Vice President Longo-Kern to take paper out of order 16474 by Vice President Longo-Kern, be it resolved that the issue of public safety in South Medford be addressed as it relates to parking on sidewalks and any other related issues.

1302
01:34:16,093 --> 01:34:17,174
Madam Vice President.

1303
01:34:17,494 --> 01:34:19,196
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1304
01:34:20,425 --> 01:34:25,529
I know that I sound like a broken record with regards to bringing this up every month or so.

1305
01:34:26,229 --> 01:34:33,915
And I know the council, we get repeated emails from neighbors and phone calls from neighbors in the Harvard and Main Street area.

1306
01:34:33,935 --> 01:34:39,319
And I know that we have a committee working on certain issues within that area.

1307
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,381
But a resident would like to speak.

1308
01:34:42,421 --> 01:34:45,624
And I think it's definitely relative and definitely needed.

1309
01:34:46,324 --> 01:34:47,685
It seems like we're getting nowhere.

1310
01:34:47,705 --> 01:34:49,727
I bring it up time and time again.

1311
01:34:50,591 --> 01:34:51,892
parking on sidewalks.

1312
01:34:52,112 --> 01:34:54,113
We have bus stops in that area.

1313
01:34:54,254 --> 01:34:55,094
We have children.

1314
01:34:55,114 --> 01:34:57,716
We have senior citizens in that area.

1315
01:34:57,756 --> 01:35:04,321
And just the neighborhood, when you have a Mack truck pulling up onto a sidewalk, somebody could get hurt.

1316
01:35:04,481 --> 01:35:07,023
Somebody could get seriously injured.

1317
01:35:07,683 --> 01:35:09,724
And for some reason, it's fallen on deaf ears.

1318
01:35:09,885 --> 01:35:11,265
I said it before and I'll say it again.

1319
01:35:11,285 --> 01:35:14,748
I mean, I've been to a traffic commission meeting to try to address this.

1320
01:35:15,225 --> 01:35:16,946
And it just seems like nothing's getting done.

1321
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:19,027
And I know it has to come from the top.

1322
01:35:19,067 --> 01:35:19,787
I mean, it has to come.

1323
01:35:20,528 --> 01:35:23,930
The administration has to rule on this one way or another.

1324
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:27,251
So we haven't got anything in writing with regards to this being allowed.

1325
01:35:27,311 --> 01:35:35,696
But from what I understand, when residents and people call and ask for enforcement, some people are told that this is allowed.

1326
01:35:36,376 --> 01:35:37,257
I don't think it's right.

1327
01:35:37,277 --> 01:35:41,559
I think we need to find a way for the business district

1328
01:35:42,144 --> 01:35:47,146
and the neighbors to coexist in a safe manner, a safe manner.

1329
01:35:47,206 --> 01:36:02,592
So whether that's a committee of the whole meeting with the chief of police and the neighbors and the business owners, we need to figure something out to alleviate this safety concern that so many have, not just, we do get emails repeatedly, pictures all the time.

1330
01:36:03,012 --> 01:36:05,933
So we see it, we drive by, we see it happening.

1331
01:36:06,515 --> 01:36:09,677
And it's an unsafe situation that needs to be resolved.

1332
01:36:09,717 --> 01:36:15,981
We need some enforcement and we need to figure out a way to work on this together as a community, as a whole.

1333
01:36:16,742 --> 01:36:20,384
You know, whether we pinpoint whose cars and whose trucks are making deliveries.

1334
01:36:21,405 --> 01:36:22,386
You know, I see the pictures.

1335
01:36:22,506 --> 01:36:25,888
I don't know exactly, but, you know, you have a feeling, you know who it is.

1336
01:36:25,928 --> 01:36:28,249
Well, let's figure out whether it be a loading zone.

1337
01:36:28,289 --> 01:36:33,433
And I think there is a committee working on that and we can get some updates on that, but something needs to,

1338
01:36:34,794 --> 01:36:44,263
relieve the stress of people who want to walk, traverse the sidewalks, maybe go grab a pastry at Arthur's Pastry, but are scared to walk on Medford's sidewalks.

1339
01:36:45,845 --> 01:36:47,026
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1340
01:36:47,066 --> 01:36:48,927
Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Bally.

1341
01:36:49,048 --> 01:36:50,829
If I can, shed some light on this.

1342
01:36:50,909 --> 01:36:56,695
I know that, and I appreciate Council President, Vice President Longo Kern bringing this up again.

1343
01:36:58,903 --> 01:37:03,526
We are actively working with subcommittee on transportation just to shed a little light.

1344
01:37:04,587 --> 01:37:16,875
We have met with the T and the DOT about talking about moving or eliminating or temporarily moving a few stops that were in question.

1345
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:19,457
And we had a subcommittee meeting last week.

1346
01:37:19,968 --> 01:37:31,057
to discuss those issues that directly relate to this issue, and they're getting back to us hopefully very soon about looking into a study, what times would be appropriate.

1347
01:37:31,528 --> 01:37:32,288
It would take that.

1348
01:37:32,348 --> 01:37:34,869
So they're doing a time study and distance study.

1349
01:37:34,929 --> 01:37:39,831
They're doing a ridership study and we're talking and filling everybody in.

1350
01:37:40,232 --> 01:37:46,414
I know the, uh, disability commission is very involved and we're making sure that every resident is heard.

1351
01:37:46,474 --> 01:37:53,537
So I wanted to make sure with that issue being said, that led me to a meeting, um, today with, um, um,

1352
01:37:54,187 --> 01:37:56,908
our council liaison, uh, Lauren Felch.

1353
01:37:57,008 --> 01:37:58,589
And she was very helpful.

1354
01:37:58,909 --> 01:38:10,215
Um, part of the discussions and it was all, uh, predicated on the efforts of our, uh, resident, uh, Miss Anne Fretz, who's been working diligently for the neighbors in South Medford.

1355
01:38:10,855 --> 01:38:21,760
Uh, when we had our first tour of that facility and that area of concern, one being Harvard street and having residents that were, um, were pregnant and,

1356
01:38:22,403 --> 01:38:29,108
the trucks pulling up and idling in front of where the children's bedroom would be ended up being very dangerous.

1357
01:38:29,268 --> 01:38:32,751
And I think that meeting today with Ms.

1358
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:51,086
Felch and talking about a simple fix and something we talked to the residents and that neighbor in particular and Anne and some other folks that putting planters along Harvard Street to something as simple as planters just to eliminate that concern

1359
01:38:51,748 --> 01:38:53,481
and a decade of plantas that

1360
01:38:54,316 --> 01:38:58,759
I got a word back this afternoon that that would happen relatively soon.

1361
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:03,842
The mayor supports that, and that's going to be done immediately.

1362
01:39:04,243 --> 01:39:05,563
So I appreciate that.

1363
01:39:05,804 --> 01:39:23,235
And the other issues, and like my fellow colleague, Vice President Lugo-Kern mentioned, a meeting with the business owners in that area and the neighbors, I think that's something that they also discussed that they're trying to work with.

1364
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:28,829
We were hoping that I know the chief was trying to make it here tonight to answer some questions.

1365
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:35,683
I believe Kim Fowler is here from Department of Health to also answer a few questions about.

1366
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:38,192
another concern, which is the dumpster issue.

1367
01:39:38,773 --> 01:39:48,843
And, um, I know they've already been working that Mr. Bavuso is, has already talked to the company today about the issue that you brought forward and really appreciate that.

1368
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:52,907
Um, I believe they were picking up the trash, I believe three or five o'clock in the morning.

1369
01:39:53,508 --> 01:39:57,973
And one of the biggest issues that will come in front of this council with,

1370
01:39:59,052 --> 01:40:14,885
With Ann's persistence and her devotion to these concerns, looking deeply into the ordinances both on trash pickup and for

1371
01:40:16,167 --> 01:40:22,271
loading and, uh, at different, different businesses that reside in residential communities.

1372
01:40:22,671 --> 01:40:24,753
So I think that that's going to be vetted out.

1373
01:40:24,773 --> 01:40:27,835
And I think that's going to be coming to this body relatively soon.

1374
01:40:27,915 --> 01:40:36,220
So, um, I appreciate the mayor's office today meeting with me and, um, listening and moving forward in a couple of these issues.

1375
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:41,604
And, uh, again, I appreciate and, and I know that you, you deserve to speak.

1376
01:40:41,664 --> 01:40:44,465
And I know that this has been a lot of hard work on your end.

1377
01:40:44,505 --> 01:40:45,406
So thank you.

1378
01:40:46,383 --> 01:40:46,703
Thank you.

1379
01:40:46,743 --> 01:40:48,183
Counselor chair recognizes council.

1380
01:40:48,203 --> 01:40:49,844
Carve yellow spreads.

1381
01:40:49,904 --> 01:40:51,484
I'll yield to the young lady.

1382
01:40:51,864 --> 01:40:52,664
There's no yielding.

1383
01:40:53,605 --> 01:40:56,865
Hi, please state your name and address for the record and welcome.

1384
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:59,686
Ann Marie frets two 15 Harvard street.

1385
01:40:59,966 --> 01:41:03,427
Actually it's 50 Yale street, but the numbers don't work out that way.

1386
01:41:04,167 --> 01:41:09,889
Um, this is a photo taken this week from in front of one 59 Harvard street.

1387
01:41:10,349 --> 01:41:15,910
You can't see the window where a newborn, a two week old is sleeping at this point with his parents.

1388
01:41:16,536 --> 01:41:21,800
This is what it looks like every day in front of that place at any given time.

1389
01:41:22,861 --> 01:41:25,863
And this is what the sidewalk looks like.

1390
01:41:26,664 --> 01:41:29,386
What this indicates is someone has driven across the sidewalk.

1391
01:41:29,586 --> 01:41:44,398
And what I saw last Thursday, I believe, was a school bus letting the children out at 2.30 while this person was driving, actually it was his partner, driving on the sidewalk across Main Street and across Harvard Street.

1392
01:41:48,422 --> 01:41:49,642
No, there is no loading dock.

1393
01:41:50,423 --> 01:41:51,563
All we have is sidewalks.

1394
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:54,484
That's why we need the MBTA slot.

1395
01:41:54,744 --> 01:42:07,568
And I spent two hours along with Jim Silva at the traffic commission today asking for four parking spaces to be freed up and designated as a loading zone for this particular person.

1396
01:42:07,928 --> 01:42:11,829
So, or for this particular area, actually, it's not just one business.

1397
01:42:12,329 --> 01:42:16,371
It is a group of businesses that are impacting our area in a negative manner.

1398
01:42:16,851 --> 01:42:17,611
It's unfortunate.

1399
01:42:18,187 --> 01:42:25,892
that the neighbors are the last people to be considered when we're operating a booming square of business.

1400
01:42:25,972 --> 01:42:29,574
And I believe that Mr. DelaRosa is aware of it.

1401
01:42:29,614 --> 01:42:32,396
Mr. President, you can probably speak to that as well.

1402
01:42:32,456 --> 01:42:34,277
It's, it's throbbing down there at times.

1403
01:42:35,157 --> 01:42:39,100
Um, so we have a situation where public safety is at risk.

1404
01:42:39,598 --> 01:42:42,200
and the quality of life is being impacted.

1405
01:42:42,941 --> 01:42:51,348
I was going through some documents, and I came across this document from six years ago, when we first looked at our condominium.

1406
01:42:51,828 --> 01:42:53,089
And it is a great place to live.

1407
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:58,934
Lincoln Kennedy is why I'm here, because I want to maintain what we have at our property.

1408
01:42:59,334 --> 01:43:02,317
Unfortunately, because of the delivery zone

1409
01:43:02,984 --> 01:43:11,089
and trailer trucks driving down Harvard Street and unloading at specific places and then buying lunch, they need a place to eat.

1410
01:43:11,469 --> 01:43:20,995
What has happened is we've lost 12 trees that were planted on the sidewalk apron out in front of the Lincoln School and in front of the Kennedy School.

1411
01:43:21,876 --> 01:43:29,760
Aggie Tudin was kind enough to come out and the DPW director assisted today and said, we cannot have those trees replanted.

1412
01:43:30,141 --> 01:43:31,281
It doesn't make any sense.

1413
01:43:31,361 --> 01:43:32,462
The apron is too short.

1414
01:43:32,953 --> 01:43:34,334
The trees will be taken out again.

1415
01:43:34,354 --> 01:43:45,504
They are going to be cementing over the grass in front of our buildings, which will make more parking spaces for the trailer trucks, which is why we need more flower pots down in the area.

1416
01:43:46,065 --> 01:43:48,187
Unfortunately, we're also being vandalized.

1417
01:43:48,867 --> 01:43:53,752
The trees in front of the Kennedy buildings are being snapped off in between the trees, in the center trees.

1418
01:43:54,354 --> 01:43:55,014
people are hanging out.

1419
01:43:55,034 --> 01:44:05,761
They're doing the same thing to our use on Yale street, which may sound silly, but when you find chunks of the main core thrown onto the side sidewalk, it is an issue.

1420
01:44:07,062 --> 01:44:16,048
So we've got drivers and owners parking and driving on the sidewalks, using them extensions of the streets, encouraging their vendors to park there as well.

1421
01:44:16,628 --> 01:44:21,772
And the people who live at one 59 have gone out and asked these vendors to move their trucks.

1422
01:44:22,632 --> 01:44:23,513
And they said that the,

1423
01:44:24,023 --> 01:44:27,206
businesses in question have told them to park there.

1424
01:44:27,226 --> 01:44:27,926
They can't move.

1425
01:44:27,966 --> 01:44:29,168
That's where they have to unload.

1426
01:44:29,468 --> 01:44:31,169
There's nowhere else that they can unload.

1427
01:44:32,330 --> 01:44:44,941
We've been impacted greatly by this for the last three years now in an ever increasing mountain of just stuff happening to us.

1428
01:44:46,423 --> 01:44:48,524
And it's not that we've kept it quiet.

1429
01:44:48,604 --> 01:44:51,267
I don't know how many times I've been before this council,

1430
01:44:52,822 --> 01:45:12,217
six possibly discussing the same issue, but yet in all the emails I've sent out to everyone and the emails and contacts with the phone calls I've made to Lauren, to Linda Coletti, trying to get in touch with the mayor, copying the mayor, copying the chief of police, I have yet to receive a phone call or email from the mayor's office.

1431
01:45:12,838 --> 01:45:22,285
And what really upset me is that looking at the mayor's, um, 2015 platform to campaign to be the mayor for public safety,

1432
01:45:23,187 --> 01:45:29,809
She had to, and you can find this on the website, it's to continue invest in the safety of our community.

1433
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:31,230
Our sidewalks aren't safe.

1434
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:32,210
I mean, it's a basic.

1435
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:38,933
We have children who live at Lincoln Kennedy who walk on the sidewalks while these trailer trucks are driving down.

1436
01:45:38,953 --> 01:45:44,355
We have people living in the condominiums and in the homes that are right next door to commerce.

1437
01:45:45,095 --> 01:45:50,857
We could call it an industrial zone because it really is truly based on the number of things we have going on.

1438
01:45:51,855 --> 01:46:00,923
But what concerns me about this is that it says core to our continued investment in the infrastructure of our community is the safety of our citizens.

1439
01:46:01,443 --> 01:46:05,867
First and foremost, we need to investigate avenues for improved public safety facility.

1440
01:46:06,487 --> 01:46:07,008
Absolutely.

1441
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:09,510
This is vital to moving our community forward.

1442
01:46:09,850 --> 01:46:19,278
In addition, we will need to conduct traffic pattern studies at major intersections throughout the city to improve the ability for residents to move within and throughout the city safely.

1443
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:21,857
The following locations will be a focus.

1444
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:25,239
South Medford Business District is not there.

1445
01:46:27,021 --> 01:46:31,865
The closest one is three quarters of a mile away, the Tufts Square intersection of Main and Medford streets.

1446
01:46:32,525 --> 01:46:43,835
There is nothing, despite the fact that last October, a Mr. Ernest Martinello was run over while he was crossing Main Street.

1447
01:46:44,715 --> 01:46:46,717
He was in the hospital for a month.

1448
01:46:47,512 --> 01:46:49,413
He was in rehab for five months.

1449
01:46:49,493 --> 01:46:54,295
I haven't verified this myself, but with someone who he shops with on a daily basis.

1450
01:46:55,356 --> 01:47:00,978
We don't know the circumstances other than he was out in front of Gagney Insurance in the crosswalk and was hit by a car.

1451
01:47:01,758 --> 01:47:04,279
The chief is aware of this and is checking into it for us.

1452
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:09,142
My concern is there will be more, more accidents before something happens.

1453
01:47:10,062 --> 01:47:14,264
If you stand at the stoplights and try and cross the street, even pushing the button,

1454
01:47:14,812 --> 01:47:17,593
people will turn right on red while you're in the crosswalk.

1455
01:47:18,173 --> 01:47:22,994
It's a very dangerous area and yet it is not on Mayor Burke's list.

1456
01:47:23,735 --> 01:47:25,435
I have yet to hear from Mayor Burke.

1457
01:47:25,875 --> 01:47:31,077
I have yet to get a return phone call from Lauren or from anyone else in the entire staff.

1458
01:47:32,237 --> 01:47:36,539
I looked at the history of who has responded and who has.

1459
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:41,120
And it's this council and the

1460
01:47:44,954 --> 01:47:46,055
Chief of Police has tried.

1461
01:47:47,556 --> 01:47:49,638
Sergeant Rich Carroll has tried.

1462
01:47:50,699 --> 01:47:52,201
Captain Alan Daugherty have tried.

1463
01:47:53,262 --> 01:48:00,148
But as the Chief said today, you can drive by these areas six times a day, and maybe a truck will be there, maybe it won't.

1464
01:48:00,928 --> 01:48:02,210
I happen to see them on occasion.

1465
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:04,692
I take a picture, and I send it, and I call the police.

1466
01:48:05,132 --> 01:48:10,237
My new process is to call the police, call the mayor's office, and send them a picture.

1467
01:48:12,353 --> 01:48:13,253
That's the best we can do.

1468
01:48:13,954 --> 01:48:15,014
But we just want to be safe.

1469
01:48:15,054 --> 01:48:23,718
We want to be able to walk the streets, walk our dogs, enjoy life, and live in a great place, continue to live in a great place that's maintained.

1470
01:48:24,499 --> 01:48:25,579
The sidewalks are a mess.

1471
01:48:25,759 --> 01:48:29,321
We can't wait two years, three years, to have a street fixed.

1472
01:48:29,781 --> 01:48:31,702
We're starting to trip over the cracked sidewalks.

1473
01:48:32,042 --> 01:48:38,225
The sidewalk that was repaired across the street from your house next to 363 Main Street is already cracked.

1474
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:41,667
There's already grease from trucks driving over it.

1475
01:48:42,427 --> 01:48:45,849
to pick up a dumpster, which is slippery when wet.

1476
01:48:46,269 --> 01:48:50,230
I pointed that out today to the city DPW director.

1477
01:48:51,711 --> 01:48:54,873
We don't know what can be done, but I appreciate everything that you're trying to do.

1478
01:48:55,533 --> 01:48:55,853
Thank you.

1479
01:48:57,114 --> 01:48:57,594
Thank you.

1480
01:48:58,794 --> 01:49:01,495
Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1481
01:49:01,716 --> 01:49:04,297
And I think if we can, I'd like to,

1482
01:49:05,175 --> 01:49:10,959
I'd like to meet, make a call tomorrow and maybe see if we can set something up with the mayor's office, the police chief.

1483
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:12,440
I know Ms.

1484
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:19,224
Fowler's here tonight and someone from her office that, you know, I, I want to move this in the right direction.

1485
01:49:19,265 --> 01:49:22,507
I think, I think the response I got today is something positive.

1486
01:49:22,547 --> 01:49:34,675
I think, you know, with what you're dealing with, I think it's very important, um, to follow up on a couple of issues that Mr, uh, uh, fellow, uh, colleague, Mr. Marks has worked so hard with is bringing the light of crosswalks

1487
01:49:35,148 --> 01:49:48,852
and painting throughout our community and something that Mr. Falco and I were at the meeting, was it last Thursday with open streets with the grant possibility, excuse me, complete streets and one of the things we talked about

1488
01:49:49,582 --> 01:49:51,763
was South Medford and the safety.

1489
01:49:51,903 --> 01:50:15,814
One thing we talked about, Mr. Marks, so you know, as we talked about priorities and since you were the four on the four forefront of talking about the painted sidewalks and we're talking these crosswalks and the lighting and having visible lighting so people know that's going to attract the oncoming traffic that this is a highly

1490
01:50:18,004 --> 01:50:20,247
community area that they have to pay attention.

1491
01:50:20,587 --> 01:50:22,189
I think that's part of the complete street.

1492
01:50:22,229 --> 01:50:29,337
So I think and I believe if Mr. Falco can correct me, I believe this all has to be in by by June.

1493
01:50:29,437 --> 01:50:29,717
Correct.

1494
01:50:29,757 --> 01:50:32,040
It has to be done within one year.

1495
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:36,565
I'm getting you.

1496
01:50:36,985 --> 01:50:37,325
Go ahead.

1497
01:50:38,895 --> 01:50:53,577
You are correct, there is actually a timeline or time frame as to, I believe, the objectives of the plan have to be in place, and that needs to be approved by the state, and then the funding will come, and then the money has to be spent by the state.

1498
01:50:53,977 --> 01:50:54,617
June 30th, 2017.

1499
01:50:55,197 --> 01:51:03,359
So this is a meeting in South Medford a month or so ago with the business and economic development transition team.

1500
01:51:03,899 --> 01:51:12,441
And May Burke was there and announced that her priority for spending the complete streets money was to address the intersection of Harvard and main street.

1501
01:51:12,801 --> 01:51:14,441
She made that announcement at that meeting.

1502
01:51:14,942 --> 01:51:17,062
So, so to follow up and if we can,

1503
01:51:18,035 --> 01:51:21,036
You've championed this and I appreciate it.

1504
01:51:21,096 --> 01:51:24,137
And I think that let's move forward in a positive direction.

1505
01:51:24,177 --> 01:51:35,680
Let's, let me, let's see if we can have a meeting and let's see if we can all get together and put all the stakeholders at the table that we're talking about the revitalization of, of a main street in South Medford.

1506
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:43,902
If we're talking about the crosswalks and the possibility of using complete streets to make sure those are the priorities and making sure that our streets are safe.

1507
01:51:43,922 --> 01:51:46,383
Cause I think that's all of our intentions anyway.

1508
01:51:46,443 --> 01:51:47,343
So, um,

1509
01:51:48,117 --> 01:51:55,022
you know, you know, if all I can ask is this is new to me with this situation, give me another 48 hours.

1510
01:51:55,062 --> 01:51:56,503
Let's see if we can do something positive.

1511
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:57,744
So, and I appreciate it.

1512
01:52:00,446 --> 01:52:16,518
Councilman Caravello and mostly Councilman Mark championed a walk through our fair square, our fair city down at our end of the neighborhood 18 months ago and attempted to create a committee of the whole meeting.

1513
01:52:17,027 --> 01:52:20,070
to have a safety council, I think it was called.

1514
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:24,916
And that has yet to happen, and yet we've had support driving that forward.

1515
01:52:24,956 --> 01:52:26,798
So if you can pull this off, that would be great.

1516
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:30,622
And Councilman Carriello was on the walk with us as well.

1517
01:52:31,183 --> 01:52:36,890
Councilman Knight asked to have, or suggested a traffic study, which would have been great.

1518
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:38,051
That was last October.

1519
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:41,691
So it would have happened by now had we followed through on that.

1520
01:52:41,771 --> 01:52:44,433
He was not voted through on that aspect of it.

1521
01:52:44,913 --> 01:52:48,255
But there's been many things other than just the trailer trucks driving.

1522
01:52:48,315 --> 01:52:52,577
We have dumpsters being picked up, as you said, at three o'clock and four o'clock in the morning.

1523
01:52:52,898 --> 01:53:02,703
This is a four yard dumpster, a metal dumpster being picked up by a forklift and dropped outside of the bedroom wall of this young couple and their baby.

1524
01:53:03,043 --> 01:53:04,304
This has been going on for years.

1525
01:53:04,464 --> 01:53:05,265
I wasn't aware of it.

1526
01:53:05,365 --> 01:53:07,846
And these kids have been in this condominium

1527
01:53:08,299 --> 01:53:14,883
The condimenting was purchased long before there was any expansion of restaurants or doubling the size of restaurants in the area.

1528
01:53:15,364 --> 01:53:16,805
So it's unfortunate for these people.

1529
01:53:17,225 --> 01:53:21,428
If we can, and if I know what we brought up the top, Kim's right behind you.

1530
01:53:21,528 --> 01:53:25,911
So if she can just real quick with that, that's a couple more counselors that want to address.

1531
01:53:25,931 --> 01:53:26,271
Thank you.

1532
01:53:26,331 --> 01:53:29,033
Counselor, uh, counselor night.

1533
01:53:29,133 --> 01:53:34,957
Um, Mr. President, there are several items and suggestions that we've kicked around in the past.

1534
01:53:35,197 --> 01:53:36,978
Um, this council, I believe, uh,

1535
01:53:37,565 --> 01:53:53,513
appropriated 1.4, the prior council appropriated $1.4 million in funds for what would be called the Community Improvement Initiative, and part of that included portable safety cameras, portable security cameras that would be able to record and report back to our police department.

1536
01:53:53,533 --> 01:53:57,135
And I had a brief conversation with Chief Sacco about it.

1537
01:53:57,709 --> 01:54:08,818
and saying, we have two cameras, why don't we just set the two cameras up on Harvard and one on Maine, right at the location, and then we can have a guy sitting in the police station sending them $300 tickets with the camera pointing at the car.

1538
01:54:09,159 --> 01:54:10,800
I mean, at least that way they'll get the message.

1539
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:15,684
After a couple of tickets, they're not going to park on the sidewalk anymore, and we don't even have to have somebody out there on the beep.

1540
01:54:15,724 --> 01:54:26,173
All we have to do is have somebody who's maybe in the office on some downtime going through the paperwork, or weekly even, going through the tape and just putting the paperwork together and sending it out for those vehicles that we can't identify through that tape.

1541
01:54:27,133 --> 01:54:31,714
Also, Mr. President, I think that we have a unique opportunity to work in concert with the Traffic Commission.

1542
01:54:33,194 --> 01:54:45,016
Maybe we can establish certain hours for on-street parking and certain hours for loading so that the same parking spots that are used for business parking are the same parking spots that are used for loading, and they're just restricted to certain hours in the day.

1543
01:54:45,377 --> 01:54:49,057
So I think there are a number of different ways that we can look at this and a number of different ways that we can approach this.

1544
01:54:49,077 --> 01:54:53,198
And these are some suggestions that I'd like to send over to our Transportation Subcommittee because they anxiously await.

1545
01:54:53,998 --> 01:54:55,238
their report on the issue.

1546
01:54:55,579 --> 01:55:01,120
There's also the loading zone on Yale Street that's amply available to people to use.

1547
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:10,623
And I mean, I think that this council, since it's swearing in in January, has had more subcommittee meetings than we've had in 10 years.

1548
01:55:11,383 --> 01:55:16,264
So we're out on the street, there's a lot going on, and we're working hard trying to get it done, but there are a lot of irons in the fire as well.

1549
01:55:16,764 --> 01:55:18,885
But I think that Councilor Scarpelli's had at least two meetings.

1550
01:55:19,626 --> 01:55:20,526
on this committee that he's chaired.

1551
01:55:20,546 --> 01:55:24,831
He's been down to the site at least twice, so I certainly feel as though we're in great hands.

1552
01:55:24,891 --> 01:55:26,713
I mean, it's an enforcement issue, and that's what it sounds like.

1553
01:55:26,753 --> 01:55:27,533
It's an enforcement issue.

1554
01:55:27,573 --> 01:55:29,635
Nobody behind this rail can write a parking ticket.

1555
01:55:30,562 --> 01:55:31,983
Nobody behind this rail can write a ticket.

1556
01:55:32,003 --> 01:55:35,726
The only people that can do that are the police and parking enforcement officers.

1557
01:55:36,046 --> 01:55:37,307
So it's really an enforcement issue.

1558
01:55:37,327 --> 01:55:39,609
If someone's parking on the sidewalk, they should be getting tagged.

1559
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:42,792
The Yale Street is not the only location.

1560
01:55:42,832 --> 01:55:45,814
You're seeing it down on Middlesex Ave, too, at Asian Taste, at the Old Roses.

1561
01:55:46,515 --> 01:55:47,916
You're seeing it at a number of different places.

1562
01:55:48,556 --> 01:55:58,624
You're seeing it around our parks when games are being played, where cars are starting to park halfway up on the sidewalk to create a path because they want to park close enough to the field where they don't have to walk too far.

1563
01:55:59,065 --> 01:56:00,525
but the vehicle's not in the greatest spot.

1564
01:56:00,605 --> 01:56:03,486
So I certainly can understand the frustration that Ms.

1565
01:56:03,506 --> 01:56:04,006
Fritz has.

1566
01:56:04,466 --> 01:56:10,268
I drive that stretch from Bob's to LaCosche's, you know, at least 25 times a week.

1567
01:56:10,288 --> 01:56:13,788
That is one of the most frustrating intersections that we have in the community, Mr. President.

1568
01:56:13,808 --> 01:56:16,449
It needs to be looked at, and we need to engineer it properly.

1569
01:56:17,009 --> 01:56:28,772
I think that, you know, all of us sitting, put a crosswalk here, move a bus stop here, do this, that's all well and good, but if we really take the appropriate steps and invest the funds in a traffic study or a traffic engineer, I think that this is something that'll resolve itself.

1570
01:56:29,534 --> 01:56:31,376
But we have to get to that point, Mr. President.

1571
01:56:31,396 --> 01:56:34,398
So I want to thank Councilor Scott Felley for the work that he's done.

1572
01:56:34,458 --> 01:56:35,859
And, you know, let Ms.

1573
01:56:35,879 --> 01:56:39,562
Fretz know that I certainly understand her pain and anguish, because I drive through it too.

1574
01:56:39,602 --> 01:56:41,584
But there are some options out there that we need to explore.

1575
01:56:41,924 --> 01:56:42,284
Thank you.

1576
01:56:43,546 --> 01:56:45,747
Councilor Caravaglio.

1577
01:56:46,108 --> 01:56:46,808
Thank you, Mr. President.

1578
01:56:46,868 --> 01:56:55,915
Mr. President, you know, I've had the opportunity to work with Ian for the last five years that I've been on this council, probably from, I think, day one when I first got elected.

1579
01:56:57,257 --> 01:56:57,797
And again, you know,

1580
01:56:58,621 --> 01:57:01,402
We have made some strides over there.

1581
01:57:01,442 --> 01:57:02,602
I mean, it's not enough.

1582
01:57:03,862 --> 01:57:10,203
I think everyone in this council is called John Bavuso in regards to the rubbish, the Board of Health in regards to the rubbish.

1583
01:57:10,664 --> 01:57:18,145
They have been increased, but again, it's still not enough for the needs of the businesses over there.

1584
01:57:20,446 --> 01:57:22,566
First and foremost, parking on the sidewalk is illegal.

1585
01:57:22,586 --> 01:57:23,846
I think everybody knows that.

1586
01:57:24,706 --> 01:57:25,647
Again, we have,

1587
01:57:28,157 --> 01:57:30,699
a parking company, okay?

1588
01:57:31,339 --> 01:57:38,043
Instead of, I mean, listen, these, Republic Parking can go out and tag these trucks.

1589
01:57:39,344 --> 01:57:43,306
Instead of going around looking at smaller things, these are big ticket items.

1590
01:57:43,626 --> 01:57:45,747
These are the things that they should be doing.

1591
01:57:46,128 --> 01:57:53,152
Again, you know, with four people patrolling the city, they drive by, I've seen them drive by when the trucks were there.

1592
01:57:54,793 --> 01:57:57,134
Those guys should be pulling over and tagging the truck.

1593
01:57:57,767 --> 01:58:05,210
I mean, I brought this up with Councilor Langlois-Coon at many of the traffic meetings, that the Republic should be tagging these trucks.

1594
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:10,232
Again, in Councilor's night is right, it's enforcement.

1595
01:58:10,832 --> 01:58:13,513
If I had a ticket book, I could be famous in the city.

1596
01:58:16,394 --> 01:58:22,336
Again, this council can't write tickets, but again, we have facilities for people that can write tickets,

1597
01:58:22,849 --> 01:58:24,470
And like I say, we have a private company.

1598
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:25,731
They should be there.

1599
01:58:26,011 --> 01:58:26,972
They drive by enough.

1600
01:58:27,212 --> 01:58:28,673
They see it, don't drive by it.

1601
01:58:29,373 --> 01:58:35,897
They should be, the chief should force them to ticket these trucks when they're on the sidewalk.

1602
01:58:36,438 --> 01:58:37,818
I mean, they're not there for one minute.

1603
01:58:37,838 --> 01:58:40,500
They're there for 10, 15, 20 minutes, a half an hour sometimes.

1604
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:48,305
So again, and I say, we've worked with Councilor Scarpelli, like me, we've worked hard to make strides and we're trying our hardest, but again,

1605
01:58:49,073 --> 01:58:50,994
It all revolves around enforcement, Mr. President.

1606
01:58:51,394 --> 01:58:52,274
Thank you, Counselor.

1607
01:58:52,715 --> 01:58:53,515
Counselor Falco.

1608
01:58:53,715 --> 01:58:54,635
Thank you, Mr. President.

1609
01:58:54,855 --> 01:58:56,216
Um, I agree with my colleagues.

1610
01:58:56,276 --> 01:59:08,541
I think enforcement is a major issue, but I also think, um, it just comes down to traffic and they offered a resolution back in February to hire a traffic consultant or traffic engineer to come in and take a look at the situation.

1611
01:59:08,601 --> 01:59:12,823
This situation is only going to get worse and we live in it.

1612
01:59:12,903 --> 01:59:13,463
We just live,

1613
01:59:14,197 --> 01:59:19,402
In a section of the state where there's just tons of traffic, we need to have a professional come in and take a look at this.

1614
01:59:19,942 --> 01:59:26,108
If you take a look at South Medford, you take a look at the Wegmans neighborhood down by the mall, the Shaw's development, the potential casino.

1615
01:59:26,368 --> 01:59:26,989
North Medford.

1616
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:32,214
North Medford, with that possible development at the Malvern Hospital.

1617
01:59:32,754 --> 01:59:37,179
It's happening all over the city, and we need to actually have a professional come in and take a look at this.

1618
01:59:37,279 --> 01:59:38,680
We don't have a traffic consultant

1619
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:40,900
in this traffic engineer in this city.

1620
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:42,600
We need to get some sort of help.

1621
01:59:43,061 --> 01:59:49,803
And I think that this should hopefully be included in the budget this year because I honestly feel this problem is going to get worse and it really needs to be addressed.

1622
01:59:50,484 --> 01:59:52,744
You know, I take a look at the emails that come in and the pictures.

1623
01:59:53,045 --> 01:59:53,525
It's horrible.

1624
01:59:53,585 --> 01:59:54,885
People parking on sidewalks.

1625
01:59:55,265 --> 01:59:56,046
That's common sense.

1626
01:59:56,286 --> 01:59:56,946
It's just not allowed.

1627
01:59:56,986 --> 01:59:58,707
It's against the law.

1628
01:59:59,067 --> 02:00:00,207
It comes down to enforcement.

1629
02:00:00,528 --> 02:00:02,308
But traffic is a major issue.

1630
02:00:02,388 --> 02:00:08,971
I really think that a traffic engineer needs to be consulted or hired hopefully sooner than later and hopefully in this budget cycle.

1631
02:00:09,405 --> 02:00:12,807
And hopefully, this issue gets resolved soon.

1632
02:00:12,887 --> 02:00:22,573
We did a traffic study on Harvard Street back some 10 years ago before the building was built or before it was reconverted.

1633
02:00:23,613 --> 02:00:30,037
I just feel like I feel that we need something current, but we need to look at our whole city and look at all the traffic patterns in our city.

1634
02:00:30,437 --> 02:00:31,758
We have some major traffic problems.

1635
02:00:31,778 --> 02:00:33,679
They need to be addressed, and they're not going to go away.

1636
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:34,840
Thank you.

1637
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:35,480
Thank you.

1638
02:00:39,173 --> 02:00:39,693
Good evening.

1639
02:00:40,113 --> 02:00:40,534
Welcome.

1640
02:00:40,654 --> 02:00:42,494
Please state your name and address for the record.

1641
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:43,775
Kimberly Fowler.

1642
02:00:43,975 --> 02:00:44,835
Kimberly Fowler.

1643
02:00:44,915 --> 02:00:49,157
I'm a registered sanitarian for the city of Medford Board of Health and I'm happy to be here tonight.

1644
02:00:49,937 --> 02:00:53,559
I was introduced to Anne Fretz early this year, approximately January 4th.

1645
02:00:53,579 --> 02:01:00,682
We received an email about some overflowing rubbish at the Oasis Brazilian restaurant at 373 Main Street.

1646
02:01:01,242 --> 02:01:05,924
I responded and conducted a routine full inspection based on her complaint.

1647
02:01:06,697 --> 02:01:14,362
And the Oasis Brazilian restaurant was cited for errant trash, meaning trash that is not in dumpsters.

1648
02:01:14,402 --> 02:01:17,224
There were some big oil bottles back behind the dumpster.

1649
02:01:17,725 --> 02:01:20,106
So they were cited for that, and they were giving a warning ticket.

1650
02:01:21,267 --> 02:01:23,228
I had also got in touch.

1651
02:01:23,829 --> 02:01:25,230
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1652
02:01:26,739 --> 02:01:33,244
I don't want the people in the community to think that Oasis was cited for any cleanliness violations inside the store.

1653
02:01:33,264 --> 02:01:34,785
Was there an inside inspection as well?

1654
02:01:34,985 --> 02:01:35,165
Yes.

1655
02:01:35,405 --> 02:01:37,647
There was, and everything came back fine from the inside.

1656
02:01:37,667 --> 02:01:39,448
It was just the outside that was the concern.

1657
02:01:39,468 --> 02:01:43,712
No, but these, the violation, I'm talking about the violations that are relevant to Ann's complaint.

1658
02:01:43,792 --> 02:01:47,254
And that was that everybody in Medgar was due for an inspection.

1659
02:01:47,334 --> 02:01:50,997
So her complaint prompted a full inspection inside and outside.

1660
02:01:51,502 --> 02:01:54,204
So they were cited for the garbage issues outside.

1661
02:01:54,244 --> 02:01:54,644
Outside.

1662
02:01:54,704 --> 02:01:54,964
Okay.

1663
02:01:55,064 --> 02:01:59,287
And the inside among other, among other things inside that aren't relevant to this topic.

1664
02:01:59,647 --> 02:01:59,827
Okay.

1665
02:02:00,728 --> 02:02:21,100
So, um, I also wrote a cease and desist letter to Republic services, the, um, hauler who was doing the early morning pickups and they were cited, they were served a cease and desist order January 26 based on their violations of the Medford city ordinances, as well as the Medford board of health regulations, which, um, regulate dumpster,

1666
02:02:21,728 --> 02:02:22,488
and licensing.

1667
02:02:23,228 --> 02:02:31,051
So as of January 21st, I went back for a re-inspection to the Oasis Brazilian restaurant, and they were A-OK.

1668
02:02:31,151 --> 02:02:36,153
Everything was in good shape, which tells me that they're fully capable of taking care of their business and their trash.

1669
02:02:37,453 --> 02:02:40,794
So that was January 21st.

1670
02:02:44,048 --> 02:02:46,331
I'm not going to go through all of them, but I'm going to go through them.

1671
02:03:01,816 --> 02:03:04,018
one yesterday, as of yesterday.

1672
02:03:04,398 --> 02:03:14,206
And so this morning at 5 AM, I was conducting my own surveillance at the new Oasis Brazilian restaurant to see if Republic Services was picking up trash.

1673
02:03:14,667 --> 02:03:27,357
And I didn't see anybody, and I walked over, took a couple pictures, looked in the dumpster, and it was completely empty, which tells me that Republic was there sometime between closed last night and 5 o'clock this morning to pick up the trash.

1674
02:03:27,397 --> 02:03:28,398
They have already been cited.

1675
02:03:30,450 --> 02:03:31,771
It was between 3.30 and 4.

1676
02:03:31,971 --> 02:03:32,612
I heard it.

1677
02:03:32,932 --> 02:03:33,132
Yeah.

1678
02:03:33,312 --> 02:03:35,794
You know, I can't even get up early enough to beat Republic.

1679
02:03:35,834 --> 02:03:37,335
That's, that's something else.

1680
02:03:37,535 --> 02:03:42,618
I don't know how their drivers do that, but I, you know, I did my best 5 a.m.

1681
02:03:43,479 --> 02:03:55,467
So, um, we will continue to supply sufficient enforcement activities on Republic services for the after hours pickup, as well as on the Oasis Brazilian restaurant.

1682
02:03:55,887 --> 02:03:59,610
When I went this morning, there were some, um, violations of the,

1683
02:04:00,225 --> 02:04:06,308
food code and relevant to the trash that was collecting behind the business.

1684
02:04:06,328 --> 02:04:09,070
There were several bags of trash just sitting on the ground.

1685
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:13,352
There was a five-gallon bucket about halfway full of grease from the restaurant.

1686
02:04:13,372 --> 02:04:23,517
I mean, I was tearing open trash bags, looking at the trash to see where it could have come from, and I am 99 percent certain it came from that particular restaurant.

1687
02:04:23,557 --> 02:04:26,239
So we are working on this.

1688
02:04:26,299 --> 02:04:29,861
We are on the case, and we'll continue to

1689
02:04:30,788 --> 02:04:37,552
supply those enforcement efforts against Republican as well as and work with the Oasis Brazilian restaurant.

1690
02:04:37,812 --> 02:04:41,234
What is the regulation state as far as the pickup of the dumpsters?

1691
02:04:41,675 --> 02:04:42,455
When is it permitted?

1692
02:04:46,097 --> 02:04:51,240
This is the Medford Board of Health regulation number six, dumpster regulations and licensing of dumpsters.

1693
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:52,241
It states 6.9, dumpster management.

1694
02:04:55,245 --> 02:05:00,106
One, no contractor shall remove dumpster contents prior to 7 a.m.

1695
02:05:00,166 --> 02:05:01,667
nor later than 8 o'clock p.m.

1696
02:05:02,847 --> 02:05:13,530
And their cease and desist order that was served to Republic on January 26th states, you are hereby ordered to cease and desist operations within the city of Medford between the hours of 8 p.m.

1697
02:05:13,950 --> 02:05:14,971
and 7 o'clock a.m.

1698
02:05:17,111 --> 02:05:17,972
Thank you very much.

1699
02:05:19,292 --> 02:05:20,832
Counselor Knight.

1700
02:05:20,872 --> 02:05:21,432
Through you to Ms.

1701
02:05:21,473 --> 02:05:21,753
Fowler,

1702
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:25,801
A dumpster that is located on private property, correct?

1703
02:05:26,702 --> 02:05:28,482
And licensed through the Board of Health?

1704
02:05:28,742 --> 02:05:28,942
Yes.

1705
02:05:29,242 --> 02:05:29,422
Yes.

1706
02:05:29,802 --> 02:05:33,243
So, um, who is responsible for getting the permit?

1707
02:05:33,263 --> 02:05:36,063
Would it be Republic or would it be the business owner?

1708
02:05:36,103 --> 02:05:37,104
The business owner.

1709
02:05:37,144 --> 02:05:39,324
The business owner is responsible for getting the license for the permit?

1710
02:05:39,344 --> 02:05:39,484
Yes.

1711
02:05:39,944 --> 02:05:40,224
Okay.

1712
02:05:40,244 --> 02:05:47,586
So now the business owner has a permit and the business owner has contracted a contracted relationship with someone who's violating the terms of the permit on the dumpster.

1713
02:05:47,806 --> 02:05:48,006
Yes.

1714
02:05:48,206 --> 02:05:48,466
Right.

1715
02:05:48,706 --> 02:05:49,106
And the,

1716
02:05:50,745 --> 02:06:00,472
result of the enforcement issue goes back to Republic, who is the provider, as opposed to the business owner, who is the permittee?

1717
02:06:03,514 --> 02:06:04,495
As far as the pickup times?

1718
02:06:05,556 --> 02:06:07,937
Well, you sent a cease and desist order to Republic.

1719
02:06:08,117 --> 02:06:08,798
Yes, about the pickup times.

1720
02:06:08,818 --> 02:06:12,941
And Republic is an organization that's contracted with Oasis.

1721
02:06:13,061 --> 02:06:13,161
Yes.

1722
02:06:13,701 --> 02:06:19,025
So if Republic keeps coming at 5 o'clock in the morning, and even if you see them, what can you do?

1723
02:06:19,486 --> 02:06:20,006
Can you cite them?

1724
02:06:20,456 --> 02:06:21,777
They're not the permitted entity, right?

1725
02:06:21,937 --> 02:06:22,858
So who do you cite?

1726
02:06:22,898 --> 02:06:23,919
Is there any ramifications?

1727
02:06:24,299 --> 02:06:27,722
As far as I know, we're following up with Republic, yes.

1728
02:06:27,862 --> 02:06:30,324
Okay, and is there a mechanism to find Republic?

1729
02:06:30,464 --> 02:06:31,545
Is there a mechanism to?

1730
02:06:32,206 --> 02:06:35,548
As far as I know, it is my understanding there is a mechanism to find them, yes.

1731
02:06:35,568 --> 02:06:40,852
Okay, but at no point in time is Republic actually required to register their product in our community?

1732
02:06:41,273 --> 02:06:44,956
They have to register with the city of Medford as a licensed hauler, yes.

1733
02:06:45,016 --> 02:06:45,716
As a licensed hauler.

1734
02:06:45,816 --> 02:06:50,160
Yes, and part of their cease and desist letter states

1735
02:06:50,503 --> 02:06:52,164
It would jeopardize their other licenses.

1736
02:06:52,184 --> 02:06:53,824
Yes, it would jeopardize their haulers license.

1737
02:06:53,844 --> 02:06:53,924
Okay.

1738
02:06:53,944 --> 02:06:54,385
All right.

1739
02:06:54,505 --> 02:06:54,765
Excellent.

1740
02:06:54,825 --> 02:06:55,325
Thank you very much.

1741
02:06:55,365 --> 02:06:56,605
I appreciate you clearing that up for me.

1742
02:06:57,006 --> 02:06:57,326
Thank you.

1743
02:06:57,366 --> 02:06:58,966
Chair recognizes council Scott Pelley.

1744
02:06:59,147 --> 02:07:12,092
If I can, I just want, I know that with this situation, you are due diligence and going out there and, and, uh, picking through trash at five o'clock in the morning is, uh, is very impressive.

1745
02:07:12,112 --> 02:07:13,872
And I appreciate that effort.

1746
02:07:13,912 --> 02:07:15,433
So again, thank you very much.

1747
02:07:17,894 --> 02:07:19,155
Do we have a motion on the floor?

1748
02:07:19,315 --> 02:07:20,175
Madam vice president.

1749
02:07:20,393 --> 02:07:24,394
Just briefly through the chair, I also just want to thank you for coming and giving us an update.

1750
02:07:24,434 --> 02:07:29,255
It's more information and probably more enforcement than I've seen in a long time.

1751
02:07:29,315 --> 02:07:31,716
So it's very appreciated.

1752
02:07:32,956 --> 02:07:33,936
We depend on the citizens.

1753
02:07:33,976 --> 02:07:34,857
I can't be everywhere.

1754
02:07:34,897 --> 02:07:39,358
I'm the only food inspector for over 300 licensed food establishments in the city.

1755
02:07:39,738 --> 02:07:41,858
Plus, I do pools and spas and complaints.

1756
02:07:41,898 --> 02:07:43,239
And I help with tanning inspections.

1757
02:07:43,259 --> 02:07:44,479
So I'm stretched pretty thin.

1758
02:07:45,019 --> 02:07:47,160
So I appreciate Anne's tenacity.

1759
02:07:48,695 --> 02:07:52,216
keep me on the straight and narrow and helps me know who to keep an eye on.

1760
02:07:52,236 --> 02:07:54,557
So I appreciate her efforts as well.

1761
02:07:55,037 --> 02:07:55,957
Thank you very much.

1762
02:07:56,717 --> 02:07:58,178
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1763
02:07:58,718 --> 02:08:02,219
And there's one more citizen who wishes to speak behind you.

1764
02:08:02,939 --> 02:08:03,319
Welcome.

1765
02:08:03,459 --> 02:08:04,959
Please state your name and address for the record.

1766
02:08:04,979 --> 02:08:07,720
My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

1767
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:08,780
I'm a member of this board.

1768
02:08:09,001 --> 02:08:14,282
I want to thank Councilor Lungelkorn for bringing this up, but more importantly, I'd like to thank the squeaky wheel of South Medford.

1769
02:08:14,692 --> 02:08:17,218
and threats, because she's been fighting this battle for five years.

1770
02:08:17,799 --> 02:08:23,933
And for five years, as Councilor Caviello said, some things have gotten better, some things have gotten worse, and some things haven't even been addressed.

1771
02:08:24,521 --> 02:08:29,405
But I want to pick up on the second part of your resolution, Councilor, where you indicate, and any other related issues.

1772
02:08:30,126 --> 02:08:40,975
In early spring of this past year, when the city had its street-sweeping program, the City of Medford engaged in the South Medford area, as well as other parts of the city, in a tag-and-toe process.

1773
02:08:41,456 --> 02:08:44,418
And then on April 29th, this immediate April 29th,

1774
02:08:45,392 --> 02:08:53,415
the mayor of this community instructed the police department to stop tagging and towing as it relates to the street sweeping that was continuing on after that time to this day.

1775
02:08:54,155 --> 02:09:05,340
Now, I don't know what the reason is for the stopping of the tagging and the towing, but anyone who got a ticket and was tagged and towed, as the gentleman who was here last week, they should get their money back.

1776
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:13,643
Every single person in this city who's been tagged and towed should get their money back because the mayor abruptly stopped on April 29th

1777
02:09:16,888 --> 02:09:18,929
former Councilman Penta bringing this up.

1778
02:09:19,669 --> 02:09:33,838
One of the discussions this morning was the irate member of this community and what they are recommending is that they will bring that ticket to the City Hall and the talk is that they will be refunded if that's the case.

1779
02:09:33,938 --> 02:09:35,679
So I thank you for bringing that up.

1780
02:09:35,739 --> 02:09:44,604
So I think that there were some mistakes and posting is one and I think that that's something that will be rectified.

1781
02:09:44,644 --> 02:09:45,665
Thank you for Mr. Lester.

1782
02:09:46,005 --> 02:09:48,407
who came about in front of us last week, so thank you.

1783
02:09:48,447 --> 02:09:49,108
Thank you, Counselor.

1784
02:09:49,128 --> 02:09:50,649
The issue revolves more than Mr. Lester.

1785
02:09:50,669 --> 02:09:52,971
It revolves around everyone else that received a ticket.

1786
02:09:53,932 --> 02:10:06,462
Subsequent to April 29th, on a Friday, when the Police Department was informed by the Mayor not to give out any more ticket and tags, the Police Department still went down the street with the bullhorn, telling people the streets were going to be sweeped, but nobody was ticketed and tagged.

1787
02:10:07,042 --> 02:10:11,566
Now, prior to that, during the early spring sweep, people were tagged.

1788
02:10:11,586 --> 02:10:13,147
Point of information, Counselor Knight.

1789
02:10:14,658 --> 02:10:18,381
The gentleman made reference saying that the mayor told the police not to give any tickets out or anything like that.

1790
02:10:18,401 --> 02:10:20,523
I was just wondering how he had personal knowledge of such a directive.

1791
02:10:21,264 --> 02:10:22,665
Sounds like hearsay to me, Counselor.

1792
02:10:22,685 --> 02:10:26,729
It is, and I spoke to the police department personally, and the Counselor can check himself if he so chooses.

1793
02:10:26,749 --> 02:10:27,730
Point of information, Counselor Knight.

1794
02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:30,052
Also, Mr. President, the police department's a building, Mr. President.

1795
02:10:30,932 --> 02:10:37,795
Well, you have your contacts over there, and anyone who wants to refute what I'm saying, I'd be more than happy to apologize, but I'm not apologizing.

1796
02:10:38,115 --> 02:10:39,576
The fact of the matter is it did happen.

1797
02:10:39,836 --> 02:10:44,378
We've had this discussion before as it relates to sweet streeping here in the city.

1798
02:10:44,998 --> 02:10:46,439
We have our tax bills.

1799
02:10:46,979 --> 02:10:48,660
You have your water and sewer tax bills.

1800
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:55,783
Those go out, and whether you're the homeowner or the business owner or you're the renter, it's up to the person who owns the property

1801
02:10:56,160 --> 02:11:02,766
to instruct the person who's either renting and the homeowner or the business person who's there in that particular street for whatever it might be.

1802
02:11:03,747 --> 02:11:15,857
If it takes a year, and this is what we talked about almost four years ago, if it takes a year to get into a street signage program where all the streets in this community are signed and everybody becomes aware of it, we won't have to talk about

1803
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:19,403
posting papers on a tree, or stapling them on whatever you have.

1804
02:11:19,923 --> 02:11:21,185
You have many opportunities.

1805
02:11:21,605 --> 02:11:25,308
If you had public access here in this community, you'd be able to see it, but we don't have that.

1806
02:11:25,789 --> 02:11:28,091
So what you have is— Point of information, Councilor Nice.

1807
02:11:28,691 --> 02:11:35,197
I don't know if I'm having deja vu, but this seems—sounds eerily familiar to the meeting we had last week and the same exact issues that we discussed there.

1808
02:11:35,978 --> 02:11:36,679
Thank you, Councilor.

1809
02:11:37,019 --> 02:11:39,361
It may be the same issues, but still nothing seems to be happening.

1810
02:11:39,630 --> 02:11:48,955
And unfortunately, a whole host of individuals have been tagged and towed needlessly because, in fact, they may have changed their mind, maybe because of the complaints, and that's all well and good.

1811
02:11:49,256 --> 02:11:56,340
But if you don't have a stationary in-house program that's consistent, you can't pick on one week and then cancel it on another.

1812
02:11:57,060 --> 02:12:06,566
So I would recommend to anyone who received a ticket prior to April 29, was tagged and towed, go to City Hall and demand, because this administration stopped it.

1813
02:12:07,426 --> 02:12:09,427
Can I finish, please, without you being so rude?

1814
02:12:10,267 --> 02:12:16,549
Is it possible that you can for once in your life just stand there and be decent when I'm at this podium?

1815
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:21,371
That's my recommendation.

1816
02:12:21,431 --> 02:12:27,333
I would hope the council in some shape, manner or form consults with the administration, asks them for the purposes of

1817
02:12:28,247 --> 02:12:31,088
Let this year go by, it's a big mistake that took place.

1818
02:12:31,528 --> 02:12:47,312
Why, in fact, they stopped on April 29th, why the police department no longer is tagging and towing for street sweeping, I don't know, but it's the mayor of this community right now that's done that, and anyone that's gotten the ticket prior to that, unfortunately, doesn't have any recourse unless they get some recourse from City Hall.

1819
02:12:48,593 --> 02:12:48,973
Thank you.

1820
02:12:54,334 --> 02:12:55,915
Please state your name and address for the record.

1821
02:12:57,413 --> 02:12:58,554
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1822
02:12:58,614 --> 02:12:59,915
I live at 281 Park Street.

1823
02:13:00,695 --> 02:13:07,579
I came out to support Anne and her efforts, but that's not the only corner in Medford that's got cars on the sidewalk.

1824
02:13:07,659 --> 02:13:09,480
It seems to be the culture in Medford.

1825
02:13:10,561 --> 02:13:18,026
You go on C-Click Fix, and you'll see people posting police cars, other cars, every car is on the sidewalk.

1826
02:13:18,566 --> 02:13:24,670
I live on Park Street where the Roberts School is, and we have some wonderful parents that do the Walking Wednesdays, which just began last week.

1827
02:13:25,556 --> 02:13:30,678
And the walking school bus walked up Park Street, and my daughter waited for the walking bus to come by.

1828
02:13:31,138 --> 02:13:34,119
And they all squeezed by the car that's on the sidewalk.

1829
02:13:34,939 --> 02:13:39,060
I posted C-Click Fix a month ahead and said, you know, Walking Wednesdays are coming.

1830
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:40,341
Maybe this car could move.

1831
02:13:40,381 --> 02:13:41,561
It hasn't moved in two months.

1832
02:13:41,721 --> 02:13:43,982
Maybe they could drive around the corner.

1833
02:13:44,962 --> 02:13:47,803
Barry Clemente responded back, I'll drive by and see.

1834
02:13:48,763 --> 02:13:49,723
So he comes.

1835
02:13:50,604 --> 02:13:52,684
He radios in that he's coming down.

1836
02:13:53,485 --> 02:13:53,965
They come.

1837
02:13:54,125 --> 02:13:54,885
They move the car.

1838
02:13:55,693 --> 02:13:58,736
He drives by, takes a picture, posts it, and says there's no car.

1839
02:13:59,097 --> 02:14:00,498
Within an hour, the car is back.

1840
02:14:00,938 --> 02:14:02,120
He doesn't come back for a week.

1841
02:14:02,180 --> 02:14:03,381
The car doesn't move for a week.

1842
02:14:03,761 --> 02:14:04,922
He radios in again.

1843
02:14:05,523 --> 02:14:06,584
Four times he did this.

1844
02:14:06,644 --> 02:14:09,827
I said, maybe don't radio in and just go.

1845
02:14:10,608 --> 02:14:11,429
So he did that.

1846
02:14:11,589 --> 02:14:11,970
He went.

1847
02:14:12,350 --> 02:14:13,411
He knocked on the door.

1848
02:14:13,791 --> 02:14:16,154
And someone came out, who I'm told works for the city.

1849
02:14:16,833 --> 02:14:22,478
I can't verify that, and said, oh, my mother's elderly, and it's easier for her if we park on the sidewalk.

1850
02:14:22,998 --> 02:14:26,401
But we'll leave enough room for a pedestrian to get by, a pedestrian.

1851
02:14:27,402 --> 02:14:28,883
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1852
02:14:29,343 --> 02:14:29,503
Ms.

1853
02:14:29,523 --> 02:14:32,986
Rodriguez was here before this Council, and this very same issue came up when we discussed it.

1854
02:14:33,046 --> 02:14:40,832
We sent the correspondence to the administration, and we asked the administration as to what the status was for that piece of property across the street from this house that she referred to.

1855
02:14:40,892 --> 02:14:41,353
No, not that.

1856
02:14:42,675 --> 02:14:43,895
Not that side of the street, no.

1857
02:14:43,935 --> 02:14:44,916
It's a different side of the street.

1858
02:14:44,976 --> 02:14:47,016
This is the side of the street where the houses are on.

1859
02:14:47,256 --> 02:14:48,757
He already claimed that sidewalk.

1860
02:14:48,797 --> 02:14:49,797
Now he wants the other sidewalk.

1861
02:14:49,817 --> 02:14:51,817
It's the same people, different side of the street now.

1862
02:14:51,857 --> 02:14:53,878
But he's been parking on that sidewalk for five years.

1863
02:14:54,078 --> 02:14:54,818
All right.

1864
02:14:54,938 --> 02:14:55,058
OK.

1865
02:14:55,298 --> 02:15:00,559
So because we got report back that the side of the park side was actually a parking pad.

1866
02:15:00,860 --> 02:15:04,660
Which is a darn shame, because it broke the new street as they drive up onto the sidewalk.

1867
02:15:04,700 --> 02:15:06,221
I'm just telling you what it is.

1868
02:15:06,241 --> 02:15:07,501
Shame or not, it is what it is.

1869
02:15:07,781 --> 02:15:08,521
It's a parking pad.

1870
02:15:08,561 --> 02:15:10,462
But all right, I was a little confused about this.

1871
02:15:10,482 --> 02:15:10,862
Thank you.

1872
02:15:13,423 --> 02:15:17,067
Actually, Mayor McGlynn said that he didn't agree to that to happen.

1873
02:15:17,087 --> 02:15:20,011
The person that worked for the DPW said, let's just put this in at an angle.

1874
02:15:20,311 --> 02:15:25,297
And then they just claimed it because they had parked on that side of the street before and wished to continue to do so.

1875
02:15:25,647 --> 02:15:26,748
There was no ordinance.

1876
02:15:26,988 --> 02:15:31,070
I don't remember an ordinance coming through and saying, hey, does everyone agree that we won't have a sidewalk?

1877
02:15:31,410 --> 02:15:40,436
Because I spent five years of my life meeting with the mayor, meeting with the DPW, meeting with the chief of police to have a path built so that people could walk on that side of the street.

1878
02:15:40,876 --> 02:15:43,818
They paved in the path in street material.

1879
02:15:44,738 --> 02:15:45,398
I don't know why.

1880
02:15:45,938 --> 02:15:50,960
And the very next day, those cars were parked on the path and the sidewalk because they wanted both.

1881
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:55,601
Then I spent another year going back to have a fence put so we could have a path.

1882
02:15:56,081 --> 02:16:00,483
Now when they plow their parking platform, they put the snow on the path.

1883
02:16:01,063 --> 02:16:04,504
So someone, I don't think we need to wait for someone to get hit by a car.

1884
02:16:04,544 --> 02:16:06,085
I think we need to get the cars off the sidewalk.

1885
02:16:06,125 --> 02:16:06,925
I think it's basic.

1886
02:16:07,125 --> 02:16:10,326
The kindergartners walk by and they say, Mommy, why are there people parked on the sidewalk?

1887
02:16:11,792 --> 02:16:14,533
The mayor said, oh, this is terrible, and we'll take care of it.

1888
02:16:15,253 --> 02:16:16,433
The guy's still on the sidewalk.

1889
02:16:16,473 --> 02:16:18,754
They told me they gave him an exception.

1890
02:16:18,814 --> 02:16:20,295
So now he has both sides of the street.

1891
02:16:21,355 --> 02:16:23,716
So I'm going to park on the sidewalk in front of my house.

1892
02:16:23,756 --> 02:16:24,576
I mean, that would be great.

1893
02:16:25,416 --> 02:16:29,057
Because they said, because it's easier for his mom, that they can park on the sidewalk.

1894
02:16:29,097 --> 02:16:30,698
I've never seen this woman get in the car.

1895
02:16:30,778 --> 02:16:33,578
I've always seen a younger person get in the car.

1896
02:16:34,319 --> 02:16:38,660
So before someone gets hurt, maybe you should not worry about

1897
02:16:39,350 --> 02:16:43,472
paving or putting in paint on the ground if we can't get cars off the sidewalk.

1898
02:16:43,872 --> 02:16:44,272
Thank you.

1899
02:16:44,792 --> 02:16:47,133
And we're talking about self-metric public safety.

1900
02:16:47,673 --> 02:16:49,154
And is there a motion on the floor yet?

1901
02:16:51,535 --> 02:16:52,736
Motion to receive and place on file.

1902
02:16:52,776 --> 02:16:54,536
The subcommittee is already working on the issue, Mr. President.

1903
02:16:54,696 --> 02:16:55,837
On that motion, sir.

1904
02:16:56,037 --> 02:16:56,377
Welcome.

1905
02:16:56,397 --> 02:16:58,098
Please state your name and address for the record.

1906
02:16:58,418 --> 02:16:58,918
Thank you, sir.

1907
02:16:58,978 --> 02:17:00,639
Joe Villion, 59 Garfield Ave.

1908
02:17:01,219 --> 02:17:01,919
Cars everywhere.

1909
02:17:01,959 --> 02:17:05,781
There were three trucks parked on Garfield Ave on the sidewalk.

1910
02:17:05,961 --> 02:17:08,022
We're discussing the issues of self-metric?

1911
02:17:08,432 --> 02:17:13,857
South Medford, too, as I drive to my radio station and go through South Medford, all I see are cars on the sidewalk.

1912
02:17:13,997 --> 02:17:14,558
It's insane.

1913
02:17:16,099 --> 02:17:18,181
On the motion to receive and place on file.

1914
02:17:19,342 --> 02:17:20,243
Madam Vice President.

1915
02:17:20,623 --> 02:17:31,953
If we could ask the chief of police, and I don't know if that's through Captain Daugherty or Sergeant Carroll, I believe you said, if we could get an update on what the city's policy is.

1916
02:17:32,013 --> 02:17:35,296
Are we allowing certain areas to park on certain sidewalks?

1917
02:17:35,777 --> 02:17:38,499
Or are we going to start enforcing this?

1918
02:17:38,639 --> 02:17:44,182
I mean, I think we need, if there's an ordinance, but why aren't we enforcing that ordinance is my question.

1919
02:17:44,262 --> 02:17:48,084
So it is related to South Medford, this resolution.

1920
02:17:48,424 --> 02:17:49,405
But I agree with Cheryl.

1921
02:17:49,425 --> 02:17:52,846
I mean, I drive down Park Street every day to drop off my child.

1922
02:17:52,907 --> 02:17:58,650
And there are a number of students who are walking to school, and there are cars parked on the sidewalk.

1923
02:17:58,690 --> 02:18:00,411
I don't get as many complaints.

1924
02:18:00,571 --> 02:18:04,453
So obviously, South Medford, I think I get a complaint every day on this.

1925
02:18:04,795 --> 02:18:15,663
from multiple people, but it's an issue throughout our community, and it's an issue where if we do get complaints, we need to do something, especially if we get complaints, we need to do something about it.

1926
02:18:15,683 --> 02:18:19,546
So by resolution, Madam Vice President, what would you like the resolution to say?

1927
02:18:19,927 --> 02:18:25,291
What is our policy with regards to enforcement of our ordinance with regards to parking on sidewalks?

1928
02:18:25,471 --> 02:18:28,553
Is it uniform or are different areas treated differently?

1929
02:18:29,254 --> 02:18:32,256
So we have a motion to receive and place on file.

1930
02:18:32,276 --> 02:18:33,857
Will that motion be removed?

1931
02:18:36,435 --> 02:18:38,556
And if I may, if I may.

1932
02:18:38,756 --> 02:18:43,897
Thank you.

1933
02:18:43,917 --> 02:18:46,798
So maybe you can send your paper to the subcommittee.

1934
02:18:47,438 --> 02:18:55,620
I'd also like to find out, because I did ask it before, how many tickets have been given out within the last year or two with regards to parking on sidewalk?

1935
02:18:55,660 --> 02:19:02,401
Because I'd bet to guarantee there's minimal, if any, tickets that have been issued with regards to parking on sidewalks.

1936
02:19:02,441 --> 02:19:04,382
So if I could ask that question again, how many?

1937
02:19:04,893 --> 02:19:12,239
Tickets have been issued within the last two years with regards to parking on sidewalks and violations of our city ordinance.

1938
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:22,308
On the motion that the paper be received and placed on file and that we ask for a report on the policy towards parking on sidewalks.

1939
02:19:23,116 --> 02:19:30,518
and furthermore that we ask for a report on how many tickets have been issued for parking on sidewalks.

1940
02:19:30,658 --> 02:19:32,279
On that motion, all those in favor?

1941
02:19:32,779 --> 02:19:33,599
All those opposed?

1942
02:19:34,300 --> 02:19:35,140
Motion carries.

1943
02:19:35,620 --> 02:19:42,082
While we're on to suspension, 16-480, petition by Joseph Pierre, owner of Citywide Taxi.

1944
02:19:42,462 --> 02:19:43,642
Are you here, Monsieur Pierre?

1945
02:19:45,963 --> 02:19:48,724
40 Canal Street to upgrade cab number 16 from a 1999 Toyota Sienna van

1946
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:56,443
Vehicle Identification Number 4T3ZF19CXXU100816 to 2009 Toyota Camry Vehicle Identification Number 4T1BE.

1947
02:20:07,672 --> 02:20:13,155
46K59U920704 on the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

1948
02:20:13,555 --> 02:20:14,355
All those in favor?

1949
02:20:14,375 --> 02:20:14,435
Aye.

1950
02:20:15,115 --> 02:20:15,856
All those opposed?

1951
02:20:16,516 --> 02:20:16,996
Motion carries.

1952
02:20:17,336 --> 02:20:26,180
To take the paper from the table for our taxi operation license of Mr. Philippe M. Tovar, 20 Birgit Ave, number 2 Medford.

1953
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:28,161
Mr. Tovar, are you present?

1954
02:20:28,181 --> 02:20:30,742
Yes.

1955
02:20:30,762 --> 02:20:33,243
Please come before us and state your name and address for the record.

1956
02:20:34,885 --> 02:20:38,546
My name is Philip Ertova and I live on 20 Burgett Ave.

1957
02:20:39,627 --> 02:20:40,187
Bienvenu.

1958
02:20:40,507 --> 02:20:44,528
Chair recognizes Councilor Caravaglio, Chairman of the Licensing Subcommittee.

1959
02:20:45,249 --> 02:20:46,269
Thank you, Mr. President.

1960
02:20:47,589 --> 02:20:52,551
Mr. President, we have an address of 20 Burgett Ave, but the mail has been returned here.

1961
02:20:53,592 --> 02:20:54,632
Do you live on Burgett Avenue?

1962
02:20:54,892 --> 02:20:55,572
Yes, I do.

1963
02:20:56,693 --> 02:21:00,174
Then you should check to why the mail is being returned.

1964
02:21:00,454 --> 02:21:00,614
Yes.

1965
02:21:01,728 --> 02:21:04,169
Actually, I was expecting that mail, too.

1966
02:21:04,229 --> 02:21:06,571
I did not receive it, but I leave there.

1967
02:21:06,591 --> 02:21:10,473
There you go.

1968
02:21:10,513 --> 02:21:11,213
Well, we have it here.

1969
02:21:11,253 --> 02:21:13,214
We have it here, Mr. Tovar.

1970
02:21:13,774 --> 02:21:18,317
Mr. President, the gentleman's papers, other than the address, appear to be on file.

1971
02:21:18,417 --> 02:21:24,180
Again, you should check with your mailbox and see why you're not getting your mail.

1972
02:21:26,281 --> 02:21:30,723
I will check that, and I'll add my name to it, and everything's all right.

1973
02:21:31,588 --> 02:21:35,269
Mr. President, the gentleman's papers appear to be in file, and a motion for approval.

1974
02:21:35,509 --> 02:21:37,910
A motion for approval by Chairman Caraviello.

1975
02:21:38,570 --> 02:21:39,490
All those in favor?

1976
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:40,871
Aye.

1977
02:21:40,971 --> 02:21:45,652
Councilor Marks is in opposition for his previously stated reasons.

1978
02:21:47,393 --> 02:21:48,173
Thank you very much.

1979
02:21:49,413 --> 02:21:50,233
All those in favor?

1980
02:21:50,394 --> 02:21:51,154
All those opposed?

1981
02:21:51,834 --> 02:21:52,114
Yes.

1982
02:21:52,174 --> 02:21:53,795
With Councilor Marks in opposition.

1983
02:21:54,235 --> 02:21:54,575
Thank you.

1984
02:22:00,897 --> 02:22:01,397
go on.

1985
02:22:01,417 --> 02:22:02,358
Let's do this one first.

1986
02:22:02,838 --> 02:22:03,999
Let's go through the business.

1987
02:22:04,019 --> 02:22:23,153
We're going back to the regular order of business on the motion of council and night 16 dash four 71 offered by vice president longer current be resolved that the school department provide a list of all school employees that reside out of state for a majority of six months or more of the year.

1988
02:22:23,213 --> 02:22:29,077
Be it further resolved, be it further that the list include the names, salaries and benefits,

1989
02:22:29,537 --> 02:22:31,118
provided to such employees.

1990
02:22:31,518 --> 02:22:32,518
Madam Vice President.

1991
02:22:33,099 --> 02:22:34,519
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1992
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:48,106
After I spoke last week about a number of issues with regards to having a meeting with the group meeting with the mayor, one of the issues was related to, you know, school school issues.

1993
02:22:48,166 --> 02:22:56,971
Since I spoke, I've received a number of phone additional phone calls with regards to issues that may be going on in the school, whether or not

1994
02:22:58,423 --> 02:22:59,923
There are more than one employee.

1995
02:23:00,043 --> 02:23:06,784
I am aware that there is an employee that is somewhat of a department head, although not working full time.

1996
02:23:06,804 --> 02:23:14,886
I don't know the pay scale, because it almost seems like it's hidden somewhere in the budget, that is the head of a department and lives in Florida.

1997
02:23:15,426 --> 02:23:23,647
So it's of extreme concern to me that we have somebody on the payroll that is not currently in Massachusetts.

1998
02:23:23,707 --> 02:23:26,048
And I'd like to know if there is more than one

1999
02:23:27,323 --> 02:23:31,666
Obviously, I know it's going to be tough to get this information, but it's something that needs to be spoken about.

2000
02:23:32,366 --> 02:23:33,968
I got this from a very good source.

2001
02:23:34,168 --> 02:23:38,771
I don't think I've questioned a couple of school committee members on it, and they were unaware.

2002
02:23:39,491 --> 02:23:56,683
So if we could get an update with regards to anybody that lives out of state, I'm not talking if you're commuting from New Hampshire or Rhode Island, but when you're talking you live in Florida and are ahead of a department, there's a concern there, and we need

2003
02:23:57,093 --> 02:23:59,717
as a community to get to the bottom of that because it's wrong.

2004
02:24:00,478 --> 02:24:01,579
Thank you Madam Vice President.

2005
02:24:01,619 --> 02:24:03,842
Chair recognizes Councillor Knight.

2006
02:24:04,703 --> 02:24:13,796
I'm a firm believer that people who provide high quality public services and abide by the terms of their work contract have the right to live wherever they want.

2007
02:24:14,728 --> 02:24:21,794
I think one thing that we're not thinking about here is the fact that people may claim permanent residency in one community and live there not six months out of the year.

2008
02:24:22,194 --> 02:24:32,902
For example, I think we remember when Suzanne Bump was running for auditor and there became a question as to whether or not she had a primary residence in South Boston or a primary residence in Pittsfield.

2009
02:24:33,102 --> 02:24:34,483
On her tax returns, she put both.

2010
02:24:35,164 --> 02:24:36,825
She had two primary residences.

2011
02:24:39,033 --> 02:24:47,035
I don't know how the school committee would ever be able to quantify who lives in a place for up to 180 days, number one.

2012
02:24:47,075 --> 02:24:52,897
Number two, I really don't understand the resolution.

2013
02:24:52,957 --> 02:25:03,780
I mean, you know, anybody that works for the school department is provided their benefits through the benefit packages provided as an employee, their salary through the contract that they've negotiated or through the bargaining agreement.

2014
02:25:06,241 --> 02:25:10,043
Really, all we're looking at here is, who are these people that don't live in Massachusetts?

2015
02:25:11,083 --> 02:25:25,329
And whether or not we can determine whether or not they're residing in Massachusetts for more than six months of the year or not, I just don't see the relevance at all to how this is something that even makes any sense for us to do anything.

2016
02:25:25,649 --> 02:25:27,570
I mean, what are we going to use this information for?

2017
02:25:27,610 --> 02:25:28,210
I just don't get it.

2018
02:25:29,070 --> 02:25:29,910
Thank you, Counselor.

2019
02:25:30,471 --> 02:25:32,111
Chair recognizes Counselor Falco.

2020
02:25:32,311 --> 02:25:33,212
Thank you, Mr. President.

2021
02:25:34,888 --> 02:25:40,492
Yeah, I was looking at the resolution, and as far as I know, I mean, there is no residency requirement, as far as I know.

2022
02:25:40,512 --> 02:25:47,177
So I guess I'm not sure why there's an issue, I guess, because it doesn't seem there's no residency requirement.

2023
02:25:47,217 --> 02:25:52,482
When we review the budget, I mean, there's no, when we look at the salaries, there's no addresses next to the name.

2024
02:25:52,622 --> 02:25:56,244
So to me, it shouldn't be an issue.

2025
02:25:56,325 --> 02:26:03,750
I mean, I don't, I guess I'm not really sure why this is coming before us.

2026
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:10,672
I hate to say it, but it seems like we're chasing down a rumor.

2027
02:26:11,152 --> 02:26:16,154
Point of information, Madam Vice President.

2028
02:26:16,774 --> 02:26:18,055
This is not a rumor.

2029
02:26:18,695 --> 02:26:27,879
There is a department head that lives in Florida that has been unpaid through the City of Medford School Department for two years.

2030
02:26:27,919 --> 02:26:29,760
This is finishing out the second year.

2031
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:30,720
It's a fact.

2032
02:26:31,667 --> 02:26:36,009
I know from a very good source, very good source.

2033
02:26:36,490 --> 02:26:38,190
What the job description is, I don't know.

2034
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:39,551
That's what I'm trying to get to the bottom of.

2035
02:26:39,891 --> 02:26:44,733
But the people that called me concerned about it know that something very fishy is going on.

2036
02:26:45,654 --> 02:26:47,575
Thank you, Counselor, for that point of information.

2037
02:26:47,615 --> 02:26:50,296
A point of information for Counselor Scott Pally next.

2038
02:26:50,596 --> 02:26:51,096
Counselor.

2039
02:26:51,177 --> 02:26:52,957
Thank you, Mr. President.

2040
02:26:53,938 --> 02:26:58,140
I contacted someone in administration today about this.

2041
02:26:58,260 --> 02:27:00,501
And it's relatively easy.

2042
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:03,080
when you look at their payroll and what's going on.

2043
02:27:03,580 --> 02:27:11,322
And I believe that what I was told was there are 11 residents that don't live in, they live in New Hampshire and they're all teachers.

2044
02:27:11,822 --> 02:27:12,962
That's, that's what I was told today.

2045
02:27:12,982 --> 02:27:13,902
If that, that would help.

2046
02:27:14,002 --> 02:27:14,302
Thank you.

2047
02:27:14,322 --> 02:27:14,622
Thank you.

2048
02:27:15,583 --> 02:27:16,343
Point of information.

2049
02:27:16,383 --> 02:27:17,023
Councilor Nights.

2050
02:27:18,423 --> 02:27:20,843
I think, um, council Scott Pelly addressed it.

2051
02:27:20,863 --> 02:27:21,504
Thank you very much.

2052
02:27:22,084 --> 02:27:23,004
You still off the floor.

2053
02:27:23,044 --> 02:27:29,305
If I remember correctly or no council Falco did council Falco finished his, uh, uh, presentation.

2054
02:27:29,773 --> 02:27:35,516
Yeah, I mean, just to reiterate, I actually made the same call as well, as Mr. Schiappelli did.

2055
02:27:35,556 --> 02:27:42,180
I get the same answer that 11 employees, and they're all surrounded in New England states.

2056
02:27:42,220 --> 02:27:44,521
It's like New Hampshire, Rhode Island, maybe Connecticut.

2057
02:27:44,801 --> 02:27:45,021
Thank you.

2058
02:27:45,581 --> 02:27:47,062
Does anyone else wish to?

2059
02:27:47,162 --> 02:27:48,803
I may have screwed up the buttons here.

2060
02:27:49,063 --> 02:27:51,705
Does anybody else wish to address on this matter?

2061
02:27:52,605 --> 02:27:57,548
Hearing and seeing none, on the motion for approval by Vice President Uncle Claude Kern,

2062
02:27:58,375 --> 02:28:00,096
Is there anybody seconding this?

2063
02:28:01,977 --> 02:28:03,617
Seconded by Councilor Mox.

2064
02:28:03,637 --> 02:28:06,299
A roll call has been requested by Councilor Knight.

2065
02:28:06,719 --> 02:28:08,900
Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

2066
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:11,101
Councilor Caviello?

2067
02:28:12,281 --> 02:28:12,441
No.

2068
02:28:13,522 --> 02:28:14,222
Councilor Felco?

2069
02:28:14,322 --> 02:28:14,542
No.

2070
02:28:15,242 --> 02:28:15,823
Councilor Knight?

2071
02:28:15,923 --> 02:28:16,163
No.

2072
02:28:16,943 --> 02:28:17,824
Vice President Low and Kern?

2073
02:28:17,864 --> 02:28:17,924
Yes.

2074
02:28:18,744 --> 02:28:19,344
Councilor Mox?

2075
02:28:19,624 --> 02:28:19,884
Yes.

2076
02:28:20,385 --> 02:28:21,085
Councilor Scarpelli?

2077
02:28:21,105 --> 02:28:21,165
Yes.

2078
02:28:22,252 --> 02:28:23,153
President DelaRusso.

2079
02:28:23,493 --> 02:28:23,753
No.

2080
02:28:23,993 --> 02:28:32,479
With the vote of two in the affirmative and five in the negative, the motion fails.

2081
02:28:32,499 --> 02:28:51,153
16-472 offered by vice president Longo Kern be resolved that before the end of May, the very merry month of May, which is before budget hearings begin, the Medford city council be provided with an accounting and list of anyone that uses the school's facilities for free.

2082
02:28:52,207 --> 02:28:59,511
or as a denotation what is paid by each group in which account said payment goes into.

2083
02:28:59,891 --> 02:29:00,651
Madam Vice President.

2084
02:29:00,751 --> 02:29:01,932
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

2085
02:29:01,972 --> 02:29:12,497
This is an issue that has been brought up by a number of school committee members a number of times, and it's information that hasn't been given to the school committee for one reason or another.

2086
02:29:12,617 --> 02:29:14,378
So there are a number of

2087
02:29:18,931 --> 02:29:23,834
fees for service and for use of our facilities, especially in the school department.

2088
02:29:24,214 --> 02:29:28,597
I think Councilor Mox brought up one at the beginning of tonight's meeting.

2089
02:29:28,677 --> 02:29:45,666
There are tens of maybe a hundred organizations that use our facilities that pay a fee, whether that be to community schools or to the general fund of the schools, and the school committee is asking for information, and for some reason they're not being given this information.

2090
02:29:45,706 --> 02:29:47,927
I think this is pertinent to our budget hearings,

2091
02:29:48,382 --> 02:30:04,789
I would like to know, you know, this is one thing, one of the probably ten things that I'm going to ask for before I vote on the entire city budget because it's, we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars that we don't know what accounts they're going into, what they're being spent on, and how they're being used.

2092
02:30:05,369 --> 02:30:08,051
So it's very important information.

2093
02:30:08,131 --> 02:30:13,293
It's going to decide, help me decide how to, you know,

2094
02:30:13,953 --> 02:30:16,514
go about looking at the budget and deciding on the budget.

2095
02:30:17,234 --> 02:30:33,220
And it's information that we in the school committee need to be able to take an educated vote on whether to approve or deny or ask for more information or to come up with better rules and regulation to manage this money and be more forthcoming with it.

2096
02:30:38,746 --> 02:30:42,469
I certainly have no problem with the resolution, Mr. President, but I think that it needs to be a little clearer.

2097
02:30:42,729 --> 02:30:47,293
I think we need to really delineate and designate what facilities it is that we're looking at here.

2098
02:30:47,333 --> 02:30:48,454
Is it the Masha Cameron Theater?

2099
02:30:48,494 --> 02:30:49,054
Is it the field?

2100
02:30:49,115 --> 02:30:49,735
Is it Hormel?

2101
02:30:49,795 --> 02:30:51,396
Hormel doesn't fall under the school's purview.

2102
02:30:51,456 --> 02:30:56,040
Is it, you know, the side field?

2103
02:30:56,100 --> 02:30:57,401
Is it the gymnasium?

2104
02:30:57,461 --> 02:30:58,622
Is it the pool?

2105
02:30:59,083 --> 02:31:01,224
Is it the community schools program?

2106
02:31:01,244 --> 02:31:02,606
What the community schools programs bring in?

2107
02:31:02,666 --> 02:31:05,468
I think we really need to be a little bit clearer as to what facilities we're

2108
02:31:05,982 --> 02:31:14,189
looking at and what facilities we're trying to designate to get this information for, I think that that might make it a little easier for the administration to be a little bit more forthcoming with the information as well.

2109
02:31:14,689 --> 02:31:19,633
So should I take that as an amendment that asks for specific— Well, it's not my paper, Mr. President.

2110
02:31:19,653 --> 02:31:21,795
I'm not comfortable voting for the paper in its current form.

2111
02:31:22,335 --> 02:31:29,261
However, I didn't author the piece of legislation, so I'd ask for it to be amended or maybe move to committee for that to be delineated.

2112
02:31:29,281 --> 02:31:34,465
Madam Vice President.

2113
02:31:35,078 --> 02:31:39,259
We can start by asking for community schools, Medford High School.

2114
02:31:42,679 --> 02:31:44,720
I mean, all school facilities.

2115
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:45,800
It doesn't include Hormel.

2116
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:47,060
That's not a school facility.

2117
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:49,040
All school facilities?

2118
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:49,381
Yes.

2119
02:31:50,081 --> 02:31:50,281
Yes.

2120
02:31:50,381 --> 02:31:54,141
I mean, we're talking probably close to a million dollars.

2121
02:31:54,261 --> 02:31:55,402
We need to know where this is going.

2122
02:31:55,422 --> 02:32:01,463
I just wanted to know which facility, because I don't want to get a feedback that says, OK, all school facilities were rented to these organizations.

2123
02:32:02,243 --> 02:32:03,123
This is how much it was.

2124
02:32:11,228 --> 02:32:15,452
but facility is generating more money, how much we're getting from that particular entity.

2125
02:32:16,472 --> 02:32:16,993
I understand.

2126
02:32:17,013 --> 02:32:20,235
Madam Vice President, are you all set?

2127
02:32:20,436 --> 02:32:20,736
Thank you.

2128
02:32:20,756 --> 02:32:22,537
Chair recognizes Councilor Caravaglio.

2129
02:32:22,557 --> 02:32:23,838
Thank you, Mr. President.

2130
02:32:24,039 --> 02:32:33,647
If Councilor Lozano doesn't mind, if we could incorporate 16.475 into that same request, I think it's pretty much all relevant, correct?

2131
02:32:35,989 --> 02:32:36,229
And 476.

2132
02:32:36,429 --> 02:32:38,851
And 476, what I say, I think they're all pretty relevant.

2133
02:32:39,511 --> 02:32:40,692
Can we do that, parliamentary?

2134
02:32:40,712 --> 02:32:51,958
Why don't we make those two as amendments to this and withdraw them?

2135
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:56,281
You want to take them separately, madam?

2136
02:32:57,813 --> 02:33:01,815
So do we have, uh, we have council Scott Pelly wishes to address us on this.

2137
02:33:02,155 --> 02:33:06,057
Again, I did talk to the, uh, uh, a few school committee members.

2138
02:33:06,077 --> 02:33:07,837
I, they had a subcommittee last night.

2139
02:33:08,538 --> 02:33:15,721
Um, I believe Monday at their regular meeting, uh, there'll be a, um, to help with some of these, these questions.

2140
02:33:16,221 --> 02:33:32,150
at the regular meeting, that there'll be a detailed line item that shows which facility is self-sufficient, which facilities are in need of funding, because from what I hear, there are, and so on and so forth.

2141
02:33:32,190 --> 02:33:40,754
So I believe the school committee has done their due diligence, and that's something that, with this subcommittee, will be out.

2142
02:33:40,775 --> 02:33:44,597
And I appreciate Vice President Lungo-Kern, but I think that

2143
02:33:46,052 --> 02:33:49,855
courses out of the barn and will be presented on Monday.

2144
02:33:50,396 --> 02:33:57,182
So we could follow up with that and then we can agree to our colleague and then get that report right away.

2145
02:33:57,222 --> 02:33:58,303
That'd be great for Tuesday.

2146
02:33:59,163 --> 02:34:11,714
If I, if I may point information on that, I, we must be talking to different counselor, um, school committee people because, um, the few that I've talked to said they've asked for this information and for some reason are not, are not getting it.

2147
02:34:11,774 --> 02:34:12,535
And it's been months.

2148
02:34:13,149 --> 02:34:14,730
So they're asking for help again.

2149
02:34:14,810 --> 02:34:17,592
Like I said last week, hopefully Monday, that would be great.

2150
02:34:17,612 --> 02:34:17,992
That's great.

2151
02:34:18,092 --> 02:34:21,754
We could see Monday because the subcommittee members that were on that committee I talked to.

2152
02:34:21,975 --> 02:34:24,696
So most of the table next meeting was on Monday.

2153
02:34:24,716 --> 02:34:26,457
If they don't have it on Monday, then we can take it up again on Tuesday.

2154
02:34:26,577 --> 02:34:31,500
Motion to table is before us, which is undebatable on that motion.

2155
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:32,121
All the better.

2156
02:34:32,141 --> 02:34:33,902
They're going to get it and have it ready on Monday.

2157
02:34:33,962 --> 02:34:35,943
Then why don't we, why can't we get a coffee?

2158
02:34:35,983 --> 02:34:36,684
This is crazy.

2159
02:34:38,064 --> 02:34:38,885
I'm opposed.

2160
02:34:39,405 --> 02:34:40,386
I challenge, I,

2161
02:34:41,483 --> 02:34:43,765
The chair should be in doubt and take a roll call vote, please.

2162
02:34:43,945 --> 02:34:45,786
Roll call vote to table this matter.

2163
02:34:45,806 --> 02:34:47,567
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2164
02:34:49,048 --> 02:34:49,329
Yes.

2165
02:34:49,389 --> 02:34:49,589
Yes.

2166
02:34:49,609 --> 02:34:49,649
No.

2167
02:34:49,709 --> 02:34:49,929
Yes.

2168
02:34:49,969 --> 02:34:50,049
Yes.

2169
02:35:05,104 --> 02:35:06,165
Five in the affirmative.

2170
02:35:06,905 --> 02:35:10,448
We should care where the council, we should care where probably a million dollars is going.

2171
02:35:11,509 --> 02:35:20,296
Next, 16-473 offered by vice-president Longo Kern.

2172
02:35:20,916 --> 02:35:29,263
Be it resolved that the Medford city council be provided with the names of those who will be appointed to the veterans advisory committee.

2173
02:35:30,003 --> 02:35:33,486
And I think councilor Cavill knows about that, but madam vice president,

2174
02:35:34,042 --> 02:35:35,123
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

2175
02:35:35,183 --> 02:35:38,324
Yes, I'm just looking, there's a number of people that I know applied for it.

2176
02:35:38,984 --> 02:35:43,747
One or two have called, and they said the names have been picked, but they're not, you know, they have.

2177
02:35:43,987 --> 02:35:44,807
I have them if you'd like to.

2178
02:35:44,827 --> 02:35:45,607
You have the names, great.

2179
02:35:46,368 --> 02:35:48,929
We have our own, one of those collected was our own Gene Martin.

2180
02:35:49,449 --> 02:35:52,571
Oh, great.

2181
02:35:53,531 --> 02:35:58,333
Mr. Matthew Wyants of 134 Auburn Street, he's been selected.

2182
02:36:00,654 --> 02:36:01,435
Dominic Dorsey.

2183
02:36:02,627 --> 02:36:05,209
48 Suffolk Street has been appointed.

2184
02:36:06,410 --> 02:36:10,112
And Michael Vecchia has been appointed.

2185
02:36:13,655 --> 02:36:17,197
Lawrence Brown, 26 Florence Street has been appointed.

2186
02:36:17,838 --> 02:36:23,322
And Dominic Marcellino has been appointed as an ad hoc member because he does not live in the city of Medford.

2187
02:36:23,762 --> 02:36:27,805
So at the moment, I know the mayor had the option to choose up to 12.

2188
02:36:28,693 --> 02:36:33,956
but these are the ones that she was chosen as of what I was given.

2189
02:36:35,156 --> 02:36:39,939
And through the chair, so it's gonna be a committee of five, or we're just not sure yet?

2190
02:36:40,559 --> 02:36:42,380
At the moment, this is the committee she's chosen.

2191
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:44,481
Like I say, she had the option to choose up to 12.

2192
02:36:45,582 --> 02:36:48,223
I assumed that she chose not to choose 12.

2193
02:36:49,203 --> 02:36:51,785
But you don't know for sure if she's adding more people or?

2194
02:36:52,485 --> 02:36:53,646
I know there were other names.

2195
02:36:53,726 --> 02:36:58,308
I mean, I had submitted eight names myself, and only two of them were chosen.

2196
02:36:58,765 --> 02:36:58,985
Okay.

2197
02:36:59,125 --> 02:37:00,787
So, um, thank you.

2198
02:37:00,807 --> 02:37:05,831
Yeah, that's what I, they, people are calling and asking and they said the names, but it wasn't public.

2199
02:37:05,851 --> 02:37:06,572
This is the committee.

2200
02:37:07,312 --> 02:37:07,533
Okay.

2201
02:37:08,253 --> 02:37:10,495
If we could just get, make sure that that's correct.

2202
02:37:10,535 --> 02:37:11,216
And that's great.

2203
02:37:11,236 --> 02:37:11,576
Thank you.

2204
02:37:13,878 --> 02:37:14,739
Good evening citizen.

2205
02:37:14,859 --> 02:37:16,420
Please state your name and address for the record.

2206
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:16,881
Thank you.

2207
02:37:16,901 --> 02:37:18,182
Gene Martin, 10 coming street.

2208
02:37:18,262 --> 02:37:19,323
And finally, congratulations.

2209
02:37:19,603 --> 02:37:19,963
Thank you.

2210
02:37:20,063 --> 02:37:21,224
The city knows what to do with me.

2211
02:37:21,264 --> 02:37:21,645
Finally.

2212
02:37:21,745 --> 02:37:22,866
This is the, huh?

2213
02:37:23,907 --> 02:37:24,627
Oh no.

2214
02:37:25,168 --> 02:37:25,228
Oh,

2215
02:37:26,368 --> 02:37:29,070
Anyway, I want to thank Mr. Carviello for putting my name in.

2216
02:37:29,110 --> 02:37:30,912
I'm looking forward to this.

2217
02:37:31,272 --> 02:37:32,713
I was looking over the website.

2218
02:37:33,074 --> 02:37:34,255
I'm not going to reinvent the wheel.

2219
02:37:34,295 --> 02:37:40,320
I'm looking at all the cities around us websites, and I'm going to take the best of what, and I'll work with whoever the people are.

2220
02:37:40,340 --> 02:37:44,864
I have one of the better programs.

2221
02:37:45,104 --> 02:37:45,624
Oh, excellent.

2222
02:37:45,744 --> 02:37:46,645
OK, I will.

2223
02:37:47,025 --> 02:37:47,306
I have.

2224
02:37:47,366 --> 02:37:48,927
I've been looking at other people's websites.

2225
02:37:49,147 --> 02:37:50,328
Why reinvent the wheel, right?

2226
02:37:50,768 --> 02:37:54,612
But I also want to incorporate a, I have a lot of suggestions,

2227
02:37:55,113 --> 02:38:02,017
put a calendar in, a calendar of events during the course of the calendar year, and just so that it's easy to find.

2228
02:38:02,397 --> 02:38:11,322
Also, today we went with your people, the Chamber of Commerce and the elder services did a pinning for veterans today.

2229
02:38:11,742 --> 02:38:20,507
And I went over to that place and I was talking to the director over there, Pam, and we got together and we're going to do a coffee social for veterans once a month, which is awesome.

2230
02:38:20,868 --> 02:38:22,369
It's a it's a great event.

2231
02:38:22,609 --> 02:38:24,970
And we get to I can take my tablet

2232
02:38:25,353 --> 02:38:30,675
and actually sign people up for e-benefits and e-health on the website for the VA benefits.

2233
02:38:31,095 --> 02:38:32,316
It's an awesome opportunity.

2234
02:38:32,796 --> 02:38:39,438
I'm going to also talk about families and incorporate families into the veterans' community issues, which I'm really looking forward to.

2235
02:38:39,878 --> 02:38:40,559
Women, of course.

2236
02:38:41,319 --> 02:38:42,379
People of color, of course.

2237
02:38:42,799 --> 02:38:44,240
So it's going to be exciting.

2238
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:45,601
It's going to be awesome.

2239
02:38:46,081 --> 02:38:46,861
It's going to be exciting.

2240
02:38:46,901 --> 02:38:49,542
So thank you very much for helping me, and thank you for bringing it up.

2241
02:38:49,702 --> 02:38:50,002
Thank you.

2242
02:38:50,202 --> 02:38:50,642
Thank you.

2243
02:38:50,882 --> 02:38:52,183
Your city is grateful to you.

2244
02:38:52,717 --> 02:39:00,242
On the motion for approval by Vice President Longo Kern, seconded by Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

2245
02:39:04,664 --> 02:39:05,485
So you move in approval.

2246
02:39:06,325 --> 02:39:07,906
On that motion, all those in favor?

2247
02:39:08,327 --> 02:39:08,967
All those opposed?

2248
02:39:10,608 --> 02:39:21,715
Carries 16-475 offered by Vice President Longo Kern, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided with an accounting of profit and losses with regards to

2249
02:39:22,168 --> 02:39:26,649
the last three years at the Field of Dreams and the terms of the bond.

2250
02:39:26,889 --> 02:39:27,609
Madam Vice President.

2251
02:39:27,789 --> 02:39:29,390
Thank you, President De La Russo.

2252
02:39:29,430 --> 02:39:36,752
This is information that we did receive for the first two years with regards to the Field of Dreams.

2253
02:39:36,812 --> 02:39:42,573
So I'm just looking for the last three years with profit in and obviously expenses out.

2254
02:39:42,773 --> 02:39:46,274
Just want to see if we are bringing in enough for the bond.

2255
02:39:46,294 --> 02:39:50,615
It doesn't, you know, obviously the children are using the field, so I'm just

2256
02:39:51,233 --> 02:39:51,633
Curious.

2257
02:39:51,693 --> 02:39:54,035
I would like to know before budget time, where are we?

2258
02:39:54,055 --> 02:39:54,735
Are we in the red?

2259
02:39:54,775 --> 02:39:55,495
Are we not in the red?

2260
02:39:55,515 --> 02:39:56,836
Are we, are we making money?

2261
02:39:57,056 --> 02:39:59,178
I mean, it's going to help obviously at budget time.

2262
02:39:59,198 --> 02:40:02,079
We asked for that last year and it was a little sluggish.

2263
02:40:02,159 --> 02:40:02,640
Yes, we did.

2264
02:40:02,660 --> 02:40:04,180
So thank you for putting that up on now.

2265
02:40:04,701 --> 02:40:08,303
On the motion for approval by vice president Lugo-Curran, councilor Falco.

2266
02:40:08,743 --> 02:40:09,664
Thank you, Mr. President.

2267
02:40:09,764 --> 02:40:11,785
I did make a call when I saw the resolution.

2268
02:40:11,845 --> 02:40:15,367
I had some questions myself, so I did call, um,

2269
02:40:16,532 --> 02:40:17,112
superintendent.

2270
02:40:17,272 --> 02:40:22,415
And I did ask about these various projects, feel the dreams, the swimming pool and whatnot.

2271
02:40:22,495 --> 02:40:24,856
And it, uh, Mr. Scott Kelly is right.

2272
02:40:24,876 --> 02:40:31,059
Uh, council Scott Kelly that, uh, the school committee is going to be receiving reports in this on a Monday evening.

2273
02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:38,783
So I would assume that we would get reports shortly after that, hopefully on Tuesday, but, uh, they are going to be getting, uh, these types of reports on Monday.

2274
02:40:39,083 --> 02:40:39,303
Great.

2275
02:40:39,743 --> 02:40:41,344
So thank you.

2276
02:40:41,684 --> 02:40:44,286
So again, I tabled the same paper until Tuesday night.

2277
02:40:44,346 --> 02:40:44,726
I think that,

2278
02:40:45,821 --> 02:40:46,582
Let's listen to that.

2279
02:40:46,602 --> 02:40:48,884
Same motion for approval.

2280
02:40:48,924 --> 02:40:49,665
Motion for approval.

2281
02:40:49,825 --> 02:40:51,927
Move approval on the motion for approval.

2282
02:40:52,127 --> 02:40:52,948
All those in favor.

2283
02:40:53,308 --> 02:40:53,428
Aye.

2284
02:40:55,170 --> 02:40:57,692
Roll call vote for approval is requested.

2285
02:40:59,173 --> 02:41:00,575
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2286
02:41:00,975 --> 02:41:01,215
Yes.

2287
02:41:01,275 --> 02:41:01,475
Yes.

2288
02:41:01,516 --> 02:41:01,876
Yes.

2289
02:41:18,855 --> 02:41:40,092
16-476 offered by vice president longer current be resolved at the Metro City Council be provided with an accounting of profit and losses with regards to the Medford high school pool and the terms of the bond madam vice president

2290
02:41:40,636 --> 02:41:42,137
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

2291
02:41:42,177 --> 02:41:44,858
This is the exact same thing with regards to the Field of Dreams.

2292
02:41:44,878 --> 02:41:51,181
We're just looking to see the term of the bond and the profit and losses with regards to the pool.

2293
02:41:51,982 --> 02:41:54,263
Motion approved by Vice President Longo-Kern.

2294
02:41:54,323 --> 02:41:55,163
All those in favor?

2295
02:41:55,183 --> 02:41:55,704
Roll call.

2296
02:41:56,224 --> 02:41:57,765
Roll call vote has been requested.

2297
02:42:01,705 --> 02:42:03,668
Do you wish to speak before the roll is called on that motion?

2298
02:42:03,728 --> 02:42:04,188
I do, Mr. President.

2299
02:42:04,208 --> 02:42:04,289
I do.

2300
02:42:04,409 --> 02:42:07,894
I'd like to explain my vote on the last matter and on this one, Mr. President.

2301
02:42:08,034 --> 02:42:08,875
Please.

2302
02:42:09,055 --> 02:42:11,499
The city side is what funds the bond.

2303
02:42:11,519 --> 02:42:12,560
The city side is what...

2304
02:42:13,608 --> 02:42:15,029
funds the bond for both of these entities.

2305
02:42:15,089 --> 02:42:23,314
So I think if we're going to start looking for accounting issues, we should be looking at accounting issues for our bonded indebtedness as a whole, Mr. President.

2306
02:42:23,334 --> 02:42:32,980
We should be looking at our debt service as a whole, not just this little portion and this little portion, because I think if we put the whole picture together, we'll have a better understanding of what the actual scenario is.

2307
02:42:33,020 --> 02:42:35,961
So for that reason is why I'm going to be voting against this matter.

2308
02:42:36,422 --> 02:42:38,123
I understand.

2309
02:42:38,956 --> 02:42:42,919
On the motion for approval, uh, counsel Caviello was just this person.

2310
02:42:42,959 --> 02:42:44,800
I would hope that all, all of these are proposals.

2311
02:42:44,941 --> 02:42:48,423
Uh, I hope already by a budget time for the, for the budget.

2312
02:42:48,443 --> 02:42:51,265
So, um, thank you.

2313
02:42:51,565 --> 02:42:51,866
Thank you.

2314
02:42:52,246 --> 02:42:52,866
Did anybody else?

2315
02:42:53,307 --> 02:42:54,087
Yes, I can.

2316
02:42:54,487 --> 02:42:55,308
Counsel Scott.

2317
02:42:55,528 --> 02:42:56,309
Thank you, Mr. President.

2318
02:42:56,749 --> 02:43:04,095
Again, this is something that, uh, will be discussed Monday, I believe, and presented to us, uh, um, presented to the school committee on Monday.

2319
02:43:04,795 --> 02:43:07,357
Um, so that's why I will not be voting for this.

2320
02:43:08,016 --> 02:43:12,078
Again, we can revisit this on Tuesday, I would hope so, with the other papers.

2321
02:43:12,578 --> 02:43:12,858
Thank you.

2322
02:43:12,898 --> 02:43:17,280
So on the motion for approval by Vice President Longo-Kern, Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

2323
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:18,501
Councilor Cabrillo?

2324
02:43:18,521 --> 02:43:18,721
Yes.

2325
02:43:19,541 --> 02:43:20,121
Councilor Falcone?

2326
02:43:20,341 --> 02:43:20,541
Yes.

2327
02:43:21,402 --> 02:43:21,902
Councilor Mayne?

2328
02:43:21,962 --> 02:43:22,062
No.

2329
02:43:22,082 --> 02:43:23,603
Vice President Longo-Kern?

2330
02:43:23,683 --> 02:43:23,963
Yes.

2331
02:43:24,623 --> 02:43:25,163
Councilor Monk?

2332
02:43:25,343 --> 02:43:25,604
Yes.

2333
02:43:26,004 --> 02:43:26,744
Councilor Scarpelli?

2334
02:43:26,824 --> 02:43:27,004
No.

2335
02:43:27,704 --> 02:43:28,365
President Dela Russa?

2336
02:43:28,765 --> 02:43:28,985
Yes.

2337
02:43:29,045 --> 02:43:33,067
With a vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes.

2338
02:43:35,081 --> 02:43:46,566
16-477 offered by council marks be resolved that the Massachusetts water resource authority led service line replacement loan program for both private and public projects be discussed.

2339
02:43:46,607 --> 02:43:47,707
Did we not discuss this?

2340
02:43:47,787 --> 02:43:48,727
Not a week or two ago.

2341
02:43:48,787 --> 02:43:49,168
Counselor.

2342
02:43:50,828 --> 02:43:51,829
Thank you, Mr. President.

2343
02:43:52,189 --> 02:43:54,130
Uh, no, we actually did not discuss this.

2344
02:43:54,150 --> 02:44:00,953
This is a relatively, uh, a new advisory board opinion that was just issued by the MWRA.

2345
02:44:01,972 --> 02:44:20,946
A few weeks back, as many may be aware, I asked that the city look into the number of lead service lines in the city of Meffitt due to safety concerns, in particular for young children and infants that consume lead in their water.

2346
02:44:21,666 --> 02:44:28,091
And at the time I asked that the city do a complete accounting of the number of lines that exist in this community.

2347
02:44:28,511 --> 02:44:29,912
I believe there are about 2,200 lines

2348
02:44:31,433 --> 02:44:44,402
that currently exist, and I ask that the city not only do a complete and thorough audit, but also notify residents who may have a lead line to alert them of this particular issue.

2349
02:44:45,202 --> 02:44:57,270
And I just received notice that the MWRA board, the advisory board, on April 21st approved a $100 million lead service line replacement program.

2350
02:44:58,271 --> 02:45:00,933
And this program will provide interest-free loans

2351
02:45:01,578 --> 02:45:09,701
to rehabilitate or replace lead service lines for both the community-owned and privately-owned portions of local water systems.

2352
02:45:10,621 --> 02:45:20,984
The funding will become available FY17, and the community needs to acknowledge a number of things before they're eligible for this particular funding.

2353
02:45:22,044 --> 02:45:26,586
I'll just read off a couple, but this is actually 0% interest

2354
02:45:28,163 --> 02:45:43,607
So if the city takes advantage of this, it's possible we could approach homeowners and say, we can get you the money, the 2,000 or 2,500 that's necessary to replace on the homeowner's side, their lead service line at zero interest.

2355
02:45:44,047 --> 02:45:46,767
And that's a big cost savings for people on tight budgets.

2356
02:45:47,268 --> 02:45:57,630
So the components that are recommended by the MWRA that the city must acknowledge is the community will clearly establish that the goal is to fully remove

2357
02:45:58,431 --> 02:46:03,014
all lead pipes from both publicly owned and privately owned water sewer line connections.

2358
02:46:03,714 --> 02:46:11,078
The lead removal program will include replacement of lead gooseneck connections when encountered during construction or targeted for replacement.

2359
02:46:11,758 --> 02:46:25,746
The community will commit to a comprehensive lead service line inventory program, and that's what I spoke about a couple of weeks ago, Mr. President, to compile a listing of properties with a full or partial lead service line that will be made available for the public

2360
02:46:26,156 --> 02:46:29,318
via webpage or other similar public access vehicle.

2361
02:46:30,058 --> 02:46:44,447
Um, the community will target proactive outreach to customers with lead service lines to provide educational information regarding the risk of lead exposure and information, encouraging customers to participate in community led service line replacement programs.

2362
02:46:45,027 --> 02:46:49,490
Uh, so that privately owned portion is replaced concurrent with publicly owned portions.

2363
02:46:50,122 --> 02:46:53,565
and then it goes on to just mention about community outreach and so forth.

2364
02:46:54,005 --> 02:47:10,857
So I would ask, Mr. President, that the city look into this MWRA advisory board replacement loan program and that you could also use some of the money to do a complete audit of the community.

2365
02:47:11,637 --> 02:47:19,203
The reason why I brought this up is there was an article in the Globe, I don't know, about six, eight weeks ago, that referred to Meffitt having the second highest

2366
02:47:19,605 --> 02:47:24,971
lead line connections in the MWRA district, which I believe is some 46 cities and towns.

2367
02:47:25,712 --> 02:47:31,418
And come to find out, the numbers that were reported are way off, needless to say.

2368
02:47:32,079 --> 02:47:36,864
And rather than having 3,500 connections or very close to that, we're close to the 2,200.

2369
02:47:37,044 --> 02:47:38,606
And no number is acceptable.

2370
02:47:40,534 --> 02:47:45,679
uh, we, we, by no stretch of the imagination have what was reported in the Boston Globe.

2371
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:57,251
So, uh, I just like to move approval that Mr. President, uh, to the, uh, city engineer and a response, whether or not the city will take advantage of this, uh, lead line replacement program.

2372
02:47:58,112 --> 02:48:00,734
Uh, thank you counsel for your vigilance in this matter.

2373
02:48:01,235 --> 02:48:02,897
Uh, chair recognizes councilor Scott Pelley.

2374
02:48:03,117 --> 02:48:03,938
If I can't thank you.

2375
02:48:04,098 --> 02:48:04,178
Uh,

2376
02:48:05,642 --> 02:48:11,526
Council mocks, I think that a few neighbors actually reached out after watching the meeting and they were nervous for

2377
02:48:12,179 --> 02:48:22,128
Elderly they were and they had grandkids and they were talking about what's been happening Both in Flint and then and also in Boston now and so really brought light.

2378
02:48:22,148 --> 02:48:39,062
I know that thank God It's not that that bad, but it sheds light and I appreciate you move forward with this And again, this is through the engineer just to reiterate that to be to be diligent diligent about this issue is that city engineer will report back to us and

2379
02:48:39,402 --> 02:48:43,424
And it's aimed for MWRA and the city to apply for this.

2380
02:48:44,685 --> 02:48:44,865
Correct?

2381
02:48:44,885 --> 02:48:45,385
All right.

2382
02:48:45,425 --> 02:48:45,785
Thank you.

2383
02:48:45,845 --> 02:48:46,586
So I appreciate it.

2384
02:48:46,606 --> 02:48:48,407
I second that motion.

2385
02:48:48,507 --> 02:48:49,067
Thank you very much.

2386
02:48:49,427 --> 02:48:55,050
On the motion for approval by Councilor Mark, Senate by Councilor Scott Peli, Councilor Caviello.

2387
02:48:55,090 --> 02:48:55,691
Thank you, Mr. President.

2388
02:48:55,711 --> 02:49:04,075
I think many of us are MWRA director last year on television, last night on Fox 25, where he was announcing the program in Malden.

2389
02:49:04,852 --> 02:49:12,220
And they were on some streets in Malden digging up, and he outlined the whole thing for the whole MWIR system.

2390
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:14,803
So again, I commend Councilman Moxley for bringing it forward.

2391
02:49:15,504 --> 02:49:21,550
And I commend MWIR Director Lasky for also instituting the program.

2392
02:49:21,970 --> 02:49:23,112
A great citizen in our community.

2393
02:49:23,132 --> 02:49:24,313
A great citizen in our community.

2394
02:49:24,533 --> 02:49:25,314
We're lucky to have him.

2395
02:49:26,115 --> 02:49:26,295
Yeah.

2396
02:49:26,867 --> 02:49:27,347
Councilor Knight.

2397
02:49:27,748 --> 02:49:28,968
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2398
02:49:29,008 --> 02:49:31,570
I'd just like to commend Councilor Marks for his efforts.

2399
02:49:31,710 --> 02:49:32,770
He identified an issue.

2400
02:49:32,811 --> 02:49:34,271
He brought the issue to everybody's attention.

2401
02:49:34,311 --> 02:49:35,492
He stayed on top of the issue.

2402
02:49:35,532 --> 02:49:37,553
He found a solution to the problem that was out there.

2403
02:49:37,633 --> 02:49:39,034
So for that, I thank him.

2404
02:49:39,074 --> 02:49:40,995
I think that this is some great stuff.

2405
02:49:41,075 --> 02:49:46,138
And I just would wonder if there's an application deadline that needs to be met by the city.

2406
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:50,301
Honestly, there's a lot of paperwork.

2407
02:49:50,341 --> 02:49:53,743
I didn't see a deadline, but the funds are available.

2408
02:49:54,687 --> 02:49:55,748
fiscal FY 17.

2409
02:49:55,868 --> 02:49:56,348
Okay.

2410
02:49:57,049 --> 02:50:01,712
Uh, I didn't see any talk about a deadline.

2411
02:50:02,672 --> 02:50:02,892
Excellent.

2412
02:50:02,952 --> 02:50:10,097
Well, um, again, I just wanted to thank counselor Marks for his efforts and, uh, commend him on, uh, coming full circle on an issue like this, identify a problem, come up with a solution.

2413
02:50:10,157 --> 02:50:11,098
I mean, that's what we have for us.

2414
02:50:11,118 --> 02:50:12,138
So thank you very much.

2415
02:50:12,178 --> 02:50:14,920
It has my support on the motion for approval at council.

2416
02:50:14,960 --> 02:50:16,621
Mark seconded by councilor Scott Feli.

2417
02:50:16,661 --> 02:50:17,302
All those in favor.

2418
02:50:17,762 --> 02:50:18,442
All those opposed.

2419
02:50:18,582 --> 02:50:19,323
Motion carries.

2420
02:50:21,147 --> 02:50:24,630
1516-478 offered by Councilor Falco.

2421
02:50:25,631 --> 02:50:35,178
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council requests the Department of Public Works Department to paint the following crosswalks in the interest of public safety.

2422
02:50:35,938 --> 02:50:39,401
Crosswalk at the intersection of Hadley Place and Salem Street.

2423
02:50:40,001 --> 02:50:43,544
Crosswalk at the intersection of Fulton Street and Salem Street.

2424
02:50:44,084 --> 02:50:45,085
Crosswalk at the

2425
02:50:45,750 --> 02:50:53,394
in front of the Brookline Bank on Salem Street, crosswalk in front of Sonny's Corner Variety on Salem Street.

2426
02:50:54,014 --> 02:51:06,080
Councilor Falco, you are gonna join Councilor Marks in finding every crosswalk in this city and separately moving their painting.

2427
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:06,900
Councilor Marks.

2428
02:51:08,861 --> 02:51:09,621
Councilor Falco.

2429
02:51:09,701 --> 02:51:10,782
Thank you, Mr. President.

2430
02:51:11,805 --> 02:51:15,706
I, uh, I thank my colleague, uh, uh, Councilor Marks for bringing this up last week.

2431
02:51:16,166 --> 02:51:22,668
And, uh, actually, um, the reason why this actually came up is I was waiting for the bus to take the three 25 bus into town.

2432
02:51:23,328 --> 02:51:28,630
And, uh, it was actually at that intersection last Friday and, um, almost saw someone get hit by a car.

2433
02:51:29,370 --> 02:51:31,951
And, um, that intersection is really dangerous.

2434
02:51:32,631 --> 02:51:39,273
Um, and as I looked around, the crosswalks are all faded, so they really need to be repainted or relined or something.

2435
02:51:39,313 --> 02:51:39,773
But, um,

2436
02:51:40,979 --> 02:51:41,440
It's a problem.

2437
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:48,966
I mean, that intersection there, I see adults having a tough time crossing the street there in the morning, and when they get off the bus at night.

2438
02:51:49,526 --> 02:51:52,168
It's the last intersection before you get onto the off-ramp on 93.

2439
02:51:52,949 --> 02:51:54,130
So it really needs to be addressed.

2440
02:51:54,150 --> 02:51:55,611
So I'd ask that that be addressed.

2441
02:51:55,651 --> 02:52:07,100
And since I've actually put this resolution out there, I got a call from a resident as well, or an email, about the, from the corner of Parris Street to the corner of Dudley.

2442
02:52:07,560 --> 02:52:13,642
So across Salem Street, if we could add that as well to the list, amending the repair of Paris and Dudley.

2443
02:52:14,322 --> 02:52:14,523
Yes.

2444
02:52:14,763 --> 02:52:24,606
And if we could, um, if we could also look at around, uh, various neighborhood schools, not neighborhood schools, but at our various schools, we can take a look at the crosswalks in those areas as well.

2445
02:52:25,006 --> 02:52:25,707
The weather's nice.

2446
02:52:25,787 --> 02:52:31,649
People are walking and, uh, there's a lot of, uh, children walking to and from school that live close to the school.

2447
02:52:31,669 --> 02:52:34,750
So if we could take a look at those crosswalks as well, um, I think, uh,

2448
02:52:35,579 --> 02:52:36,880
uh, there'll be benefit to the community.

2449
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:37,820
So thank you.

2450
02:52:38,241 --> 02:52:39,201
Councilor Caviello.

2451
02:52:39,261 --> 02:52:44,344
Mr. President, if I could have been there to do all the side to all the, all the crosswalks in the city, I think they're all in need of repair.

2452
02:52:44,965 --> 02:52:50,208
Uh, so if council faculty is in mind that we amend that to do, to do all of them as amended by councilor Caviello.

2453
02:52:50,308 --> 02:52:50,728
Counselor.

2454
02:52:50,748 --> 02:52:50,968
Nice.

2455
02:52:50,988 --> 02:52:52,709
Um, yes, Mr. President.

2456
02:52:52,990 --> 02:52:56,031
Um, I certainly understand councilor Carvio's position on this.

2457
02:52:56,092 --> 02:52:56,992
They should be painted.

2458
02:52:57,052 --> 02:52:57,973
So why aren't they painted?

2459
02:52:58,013 --> 02:52:59,614
Why are we picking one over the other?

2460
02:52:59,634 --> 02:53:00,294
They should all be done.

2461
02:53:00,954 --> 02:53:01,615
Um, however,

2462
02:53:02,205 --> 02:53:02,345
Ms.

2463
02:53:02,385 --> 02:53:11,532
Rodriguez was up here a little earlier and she was speaking about the walking school bus and how groups of students will walk to school and they'll collect on their way to school at certain and different locations, Mr. President.

2464
02:53:11,935 --> 02:53:17,836
And I think it might make sense for us to maybe identify some safe routes to school for these individuals as well.

2465
02:53:17,896 --> 02:53:32,980
If right now we have some crosswalks that have faded out and there are individuals and groups that are meeting along a certain pathway or a certain route, maybe we prioritize those locations first so that these children that are walking to school and that are trying to

2466
02:53:34,008 --> 02:53:36,910
begin that whole process of walking to school again like I used to do.

2467
02:53:37,650 --> 02:53:39,711
You know, he's coming back and he's coming back in.

2468
02:53:39,751 --> 02:53:41,972
Maybe we can make sure it's a little safer for them, Mr. President.

2469
02:53:41,992 --> 02:53:46,275
So, um, you know, I'm, I'm looking at it saying that there's a group that's already together that's coordinating this.

2470
02:53:46,415 --> 02:53:47,976
They have pathways that they already take.

2471
02:53:48,576 --> 02:53:52,198
Um, it might be nice if they could provide us with that information or follow that information to the administration.

2472
02:53:52,939 --> 02:53:53,259
Thank you.

2473
02:53:55,280 --> 02:53:57,121
Chair recognizes.

2474
02:53:58,161 --> 02:53:59,062
Thank you, Mr. President.

2475
02:53:59,122 --> 02:54:01,743
I thank a counselor Falco for putting this on.

2476
02:54:02,544 --> 02:54:02,624
Um,

2477
02:54:03,249 --> 02:54:05,570
You know, Council Light just brought up a great point.

2478
02:54:06,430 --> 02:54:07,630
And, you know, why aren't they done?

2479
02:54:07,650 --> 02:54:09,871
We should be asking the question, why isn't it done citywide?

2480
02:54:10,751 --> 02:54:12,492
And I happen to ask that question.

2481
02:54:12,872 --> 02:54:15,632
I ask it every year, but I just asked it recently.

2482
02:54:16,213 --> 02:54:24,995
And I was told that the city contracts out for roughly 80% of the painting of crosswalks in the city.

2483
02:54:25,595 --> 02:54:27,256
So 80% is contracted out.

2484
02:54:27,776 --> 02:54:31,457
Over the last several years, contracted services,

2485
02:54:32,021 --> 02:54:45,810
have been on a decline in the budget, and we're at a point right now that our current contract does not call for the completion of the 80% that's required under the painting.

2486
02:54:46,831 --> 02:54:48,892
That's not an excuse, that's reality.

2487
02:54:49,753 --> 02:54:58,198
And we're in May now, we're five months into the year, and to have our crosswalks, as Councilor Falco mentioned, all faded.

2488
02:54:58,218 --> 02:55:00,520
I mean, you can add churches to the schools,

2489
02:55:01,272 --> 02:55:05,893
senior housing, everywhere in the city, they're faded, Mr. President.

2490
02:55:06,493 --> 02:55:10,214
And, you know, the mayor recently entered into a complete streets with the state.

2491
02:55:10,615 --> 02:55:12,015
And it was a great photo op.

2492
02:55:12,375 --> 02:55:16,036
And it sounds great when you read the brochure and there's money available.

2493
02:55:16,496 --> 02:55:20,697
But this is basic, basic city service.

2494
02:55:21,378 --> 02:55:23,118
We're not asking to move mountains.

2495
02:55:23,458 --> 02:55:26,539
We're asking to paint a simple crosswalk.

2496
02:55:27,064 --> 02:55:28,284
That's all we're asking.

2497
02:55:28,844 --> 02:55:41,488
And the complete streets is great, and they should move forward with that, but I think it's a shame that basic city services, we have to stand up here week after week and do them one at a time.

2498
02:55:42,988 --> 02:55:47,630
That's not very productive, and it's not productive for the DPW who has to run out and do them.

2499
02:55:48,610 --> 02:55:56,492
And if we don't have enough money in the contracted services for painting crosswalks, that should be brought to our attention

2500
02:55:57,050 --> 02:55:59,351
immediately after 10 resolutions.

2501
02:55:59,811 --> 02:56:11,996
And we can move because at the end of the year, as we all know, we've been on this council for a number of years, there's millions of dollars in line item transfers, there's money in the budget that could be appropriated to do a public safety concern.

2502
02:56:13,193 --> 02:56:16,674
So, you know, I'm really tired of talking about this, Mr. President.

2503
02:56:17,134 --> 02:56:32,098
I'm really fed up with talking about this basic, basic, you know, service and to use it as a PR to get press in the newspaper about, oh, look at what the city's doing now, complete streets, safe streets.

2504
02:56:32,618 --> 02:56:35,879
It's a lot of hogwash because we don't have complete streets.

2505
02:56:36,059 --> 02:56:38,320
We get complete messes throughout the community.

2506
02:56:38,740 --> 02:56:40,380
That's what we have, Mr. President.

2507
02:56:40,901 --> 02:56:42,421
And you can talk about the crosswalk.

2508
02:56:42,917 --> 02:56:46,900
Let's talk about the catch basins, the hundreds of catch basins.

2509
02:56:47,240 --> 02:56:52,584
I ask any of my colleagues to go up and down the street, not the manhole cover, which are in deplorable condition.

2510
02:56:52,964 --> 02:56:55,005
Check the catch basins that catch the groundwater.

2511
02:56:55,305 --> 02:57:04,792
And you'll see a majority of them on every street are sinking down, posing a real concern not only for drainage, but public safety concerns, Mr. President.

2512
02:57:05,112 --> 02:57:05,953
That's one aspect.

2513
02:57:06,013 --> 02:57:07,734
And the potholes is another aspect.

2514
02:57:08,323 --> 02:57:13,988
So, you know, it's great to say that we're going to become this complete street with the state funding.

2515
02:57:14,388 --> 02:57:16,150
But, you know, that's a one-time fix.

2516
02:57:16,570 --> 02:57:29,240
And if the city doesn't create their own internal policy to deal with this year after year, Mr. President, we're going to be back, as we all mentioned about some of the other neglect issues, be back facing the same issue.

2517
02:57:29,561 --> 02:57:31,242
I've been on the council 14 years.

2518
02:57:31,963 --> 02:57:34,745
Every single year, we have to bring up this issue.

2519
02:57:35,505 --> 02:57:36,947
Every single year, without a doubt.

2520
02:57:37,983 --> 02:57:39,924
Without a doubt, it comes up every year.

2521
02:57:40,645 --> 02:57:49,210
And you would think as an administrator and someone that specially served on the council and heard these concerns, this would be one of the issues that you tackle.

2522
02:57:49,810 --> 02:57:51,251
And it's not a difficult issue.

2523
02:57:51,891 --> 02:57:53,052
It really, really isn't.

2524
02:57:53,692 --> 02:58:00,016
You know, so I don't know what it's going to take, Mr. President, but I'm getting real frustrated talking about the same issues.

2525
02:58:00,036 --> 02:58:07,240
You're right, I'd rather focus my attention on things that we should be looking out of the box, things we should be discussing about improving this community

2526
02:58:07,605 --> 02:58:12,649
and not basic amenities, basic city services that we're all paying for.

2527
02:58:13,149 --> 02:58:16,511
And when you get a crosswalk done, oh, I want to thank the administration.

2528
02:58:16,531 --> 02:58:17,592
I want to thank DPW.

2529
02:58:17,932 --> 02:58:19,914
We shouldn't have to go through that list of thank yous.

2530
02:58:20,654 --> 02:58:23,896
This is a service that should be done without fail every year.

2531
02:58:25,077 --> 02:58:26,358
Out feel, Mr. President.

2532
02:58:26,398 --> 02:58:27,559
So I don't know.

2533
02:58:27,699 --> 02:58:28,540
I don't know what it's going to take.

2534
02:58:29,185 --> 02:58:50,516
a few more fatalities in the community, and then someone in the administration will finally wake up and say, oh, we need to do a better job about making sure that our crosswalks are visible, making sure there's proper signage, making sure that we abide by some of the safety rules that are laid out by many other communities when it comes to traffic calming approaches.

2535
02:58:51,316 --> 02:58:52,757
You know, there's so many things that can be done.

2536
02:58:53,117 --> 02:59:02,102
Someone recently sent me, as I spoke about the 3D markings that some communities are doing in the road where cars are speeding.

2537
02:59:02,442 --> 02:59:09,606
They're able to paint where it's a flat surface, but they make it look like it's elevated through a form of the way it's done.

2538
02:59:09,926 --> 02:59:12,868
And it looks like a 3D obstruction in the road.

2539
02:59:13,208 --> 02:59:14,509
And it makes cars slow down.

2540
02:59:15,009 --> 02:59:20,512
And it's really a great way of controlling speeding at a very minimal cost.

2541
02:59:21,153 --> 02:59:27,758
And, you know, we don't have to create the wheel, but, you know, we still have two raised crosswalks.

2542
02:59:28,239 --> 02:59:29,280
Remember the pilot program?

2543
02:59:30,321 --> 02:59:31,141
It called for three.

2544
02:59:31,742 --> 02:59:32,362
We have one.

2545
02:59:33,003 --> 02:59:34,104
I think that was two years ago.

2546
02:59:34,604 --> 02:59:35,625
It's kind of smushed out.

2547
02:59:36,225 --> 02:59:39,128
We haven't we haven't implemented the other two, Mr. President.

2548
02:59:39,528 --> 02:59:41,670
It's similar to the citywide streets.

2549
02:59:41,730 --> 02:59:45,713
We've a pilot program where we don't sweep off our streets now.

2550
02:59:46,073 --> 02:59:47,635
Look at any major thoroughfares.

2551
02:59:47,895 --> 02:59:50,397
The cars that are parked overnight aren't being towed.

2552
02:59:50,836 --> 02:59:52,537
and they're not sweeping appropriately.

2553
02:59:52,998 --> 02:59:54,138
And there's no secret to that.

2554
02:59:54,218 --> 03:00:00,543
So, um, you know, here we go again with a pilot programs that really mean nothing.

2555
03:00:00,923 --> 03:00:01,283
Thank you.

2556
03:00:01,403 --> 03:00:03,125
Motion for approval by council.

2557
03:00:03,185 --> 03:00:04,065
Falco has amended.

2558
03:00:04,125 --> 03:00:07,067
Mr. Citizen, you wish to speak on this matter?

2559
03:00:08,328 --> 03:00:08,709
Welcome.

2560
03:00:08,749 --> 03:00:11,791
Please take your name and address for the record.

2561
03:00:12,571 --> 03:00:14,673
No, we're talking about the crosswalks.

2562
03:00:15,493 --> 03:00:17,255
Andrew Carson at a cushion street method.

2563
03:00:18,175 --> 03:00:18,575
Thank you.

2564
03:00:18,636 --> 03:00:19,176
Counselor.

2565
03:00:22,126 --> 03:00:27,570
You saw like a broken record and you're doing a good job because it's an important issue.

2566
03:00:27,610 --> 03:00:31,753
You would think in a city like this we could have nice and bright on these crosswalks.

2567
03:00:34,375 --> 03:00:43,723
Maybe the 3D hologram effect might be a good way to do it and maybe the color could be changed.

2568
03:00:44,283 --> 03:00:45,104
I'm not sure.

2569
03:00:45,124 --> 03:00:46,345
Instead of the whites.

2570
03:00:47,502 --> 03:00:50,725
and maybe make it yellow if that's allowed legally.

2571
03:00:51,906 --> 03:00:59,114
And maybe we should check out the paint manufacturer and make sure that the paint they've been using is not a defective batch number.

2572
03:00:59,634 --> 03:01:00,535
Something is amiss.

2573
03:01:00,915 --> 03:01:03,098
They shouldn't be fading so quickly, in my opinion.

2574
03:01:04,139 --> 03:01:06,981
And with less rock salt being used this past winter.

2575
03:01:11,351 --> 03:01:16,795
I don't know, maybe it should be just as bright as the front of the vinyl LP Abbey Road.

2576
03:01:17,295 --> 03:01:18,015
Good luck, people.

2577
03:01:18,616 --> 03:01:19,056
Thank you.

2578
03:01:19,076 --> 03:01:21,558
A motion for approval by Councilor Falco as amended.

2579
03:01:21,618 --> 03:01:22,358
All those in favor?

2580
03:01:22,378 --> 03:01:25,160
All those opposed?

2581
03:01:25,180 --> 03:01:28,362
16-483 offered by Councilor Cavill will be resolved at the Memphis City Council.

2582
03:01:28,863 --> 03:01:35,687
Commend and congratulate Sophie Santoro on the celebration of her 90th birthday.

2583
03:01:35,807 --> 03:01:36,428
Councilor.

2584
03:01:36,808 --> 03:01:37,689
Thank you, Mr. President.

2585
03:01:37,769 --> 03:01:39,710
I think Sophie might be sleeping now.

2586
03:01:40,362 --> 03:01:41,002
at this later.

2587
03:01:43,063 --> 03:01:52,926
Um, I would rather, I was able to, uh, uh, today is actually her 90th birthday and I was able to, uh, go to her birthday party on Saturday and, uh, present you with a commendation.

2588
03:01:52,946 --> 03:01:59,268
So, um, I just wanted to publicly, uh, uh, congratulate her on her 90th birthday and hope she's awake seeing this.

2589
03:01:59,728 --> 03:02:00,808
Happy birthday, Sophie.

2590
03:02:02,369 --> 03:02:03,049
Uh, Councilor Marks.

2591
03:02:03,889 --> 03:02:06,550
I want to thank Councilor Caviello for putting this on, uh,

2592
03:02:07,183 --> 03:02:09,544
Uh, Mr. Santoro is a sweetheart of a woman.

2593
03:02:10,344 --> 03:02:13,725
Uh, she may be 90, but let me tell you, she's as feisty as a 50 year old.

2594
03:02:14,425 --> 03:02:17,286
And, uh, I wish her well on her birthday and many, many more to come.

2595
03:02:17,706 --> 03:02:18,006
Thank you.

2596
03:02:18,066 --> 03:02:20,827
On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Marks.

2597
03:02:20,887 --> 03:02:21,507
All those in favor?

2598
03:02:21,867 --> 03:02:22,467
All those opposed?

2599
03:02:23,748 --> 03:02:29,529
Uh, Committee of the Whole next week, Wednesday, May 18th at six o'clock, the Public Safety Summit.

2600
03:02:30,730 --> 03:02:34,951
Uh, Subcommittee on Cultural Arts and History meeting notice, Tuesday, May 17th.

2601
03:02:41,530 --> 03:02:44,732
in room 207, subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.

2602
03:02:45,213 --> 03:02:57,541
I also got a request in writing in my packet over the weekend asking for a committee of the whole on the night that the vice president had already scheduled the subcommittee meeting.

2603
03:02:57,961 --> 03:03:00,563
So I'm going to look into rescheduling that with the mayor.

2604
03:03:00,963 --> 03:03:04,746
